On a brisk and windy night at Dedeaux Field, the Trojans fell short of a comeback against UC Riverside in the two programs’ first matchup since 2012. The atmosphere in the stadium seemed to mirror the game; there was a sense in the bleak air among the mere 179 fans that the game wasn’t going to fall the Trojans’ way. USC had the tying runner on third base in the bottom of the ninth, but redshirt freshman infielder and UCLA transfer Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek could not cash in, as the Trojans fell to the Highlanders 6-5.
The Trojans had a rough start from the very beginning. Sophomore starting pitcher Fisher Johnson gave up a triple to junior utility Tyler Weaver on the game’s opening pitch. It was a windy night in Los Angeles, and senior right fielder Cole Gabrielson struggled to catch the flyball from Weaver that looked routine. Johnson only surrendered one run in the first inning, but in two innings pitched, the pitcher allowed six hits and three earned runs. 
“He was up in the zone. He’s got good stuff, he’s a sinker ball guy … and once you get the ball up, wherever you’re playing, you’re gonna get hit a little bit.” said Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz in a postgame interview. “So he just left some balls up around the zone instead of sinking it like he usually does.”
The Highlanders stormed out to a 3-0 lead, but the Trojans quietly came back in the second inning with a pair of bases-loaded free passes to tie the game at three. Senior catcher Connor Clift had a big day at the plate. Clift batted in the Trojan’s first run of the ball game, and hit his first career home run in a USC uniform in the eighth inning to cut UC Riverside’s lead to two. 
As for lineup changes for the Trojans, Clift made his third start behind the dish, and freshman infielder Ethan Hedges made his second start of the season at first base.
“We’re trying to figure out who needs to be where … We want to give other guys opportunities as well.” Stankiewicz said. “Clift was swinging the bat, he had a good day offensively as well, just creating opportunities for guys and some guys are taking advantage of it.”
Ultimately, the one thing that hurt the Trojans was the control of their pitchers. USC’s eight pitchers walked six batters and hit one. 
“Unfortunately [walks were] a big part of it. You can’t give free bases up. We gave up too many in those middle innings as we gave up three [runs].” Stankiewicz said. “It’s a tough lesson, we got to be better.”
The Trojans will look to snap their five-game winless streak over the weekend with matchups against Sacramento State, Tulane, and UCLA. Stankiewicz has no concern about the availability of arms even though he used seven pitchers out of the bullpen Wednesday.
“Everybody went one [inning], so our bullpen will be ready to go this weekend,” Stankiewicz said. 
Junior right-handed pitcher Tyler Stromsborg will get the nod Friday night against Sacramento State. Stromsborg is 1-1 on the season with a 5.73 ERA. He will be looking to limit the walks and raise his strikeout rate against the 6-1 Hornets.
“[We] need a big night out of Stromsborg, we need him to pitch well and get deep into the game and give us an opportunity to put runs on the board, but he’ll be ready to go,” Stankiewicz said. “I have no doubt in my mind, he’s been steady and getting better in his outings.”
Although the Trojans are averaging 8.75 runs per game, while hitting .302 as a team, Stankiewicz made a point about how the bats needed an awakening against UC Riverside. 
“We didn’t swing the bats well. We were swinging the bats well in spurts, we chased out of the zone, the wind was blowing in, we got to hit line drives … big swings in conditions like this it’s just hard,” Stankiewicz said. “It’s a good lesson offensively for us as well.”
To top that, it’s even more difficult to win games when pitchers have a combined 5.53 ERA. 
The big showdown over the weekend is on Sunday when the Trojans travel to Jackie Robinson Stadium to take on the crosstown rival UCLA Bruins. The Bruins are 6-2 on the season, ranked No. 17 in the nation. 
USC swept their opening series against Marist, but have struggled since.
“We won three out of the gate, you know we’ve struggled since, so we just got to figure out a way to get a win … bounce back and play good complete [baseball],” Stankiewicz said.
The Trojans will look to get back in the win column as they take on Sacramento State at Dedeaux Field Friday night at 6:30 p.m.

Once in a while, I’ll read a piece from the Daily Trojan, for instance, that I strongly relate to — almost to the point where I question if I’ve had the same experience. However, this rarely happens. Despite advocacy for more diversity, there will always be gaps. I am trying to fill those gaps by sharing my perspective as a first-generation, low-income, female Cambodian American student.
As someone at the intersection of multiple identities, it’s been difficult to receive adequate representation. My feelings have been heavily influenced by the lack of diversity in digital media growing up in the early 2000s. The minimal Asian, female representation I had as a child — Ni Hao Kai-Lan and Mulan — was insufficient in making me feel seen. The surface-level representation of my identity continued into my pre-teens, where Asian characters remained predominantly from the east side of the continent and came from middle-class backgrounds. 
No character was Khmer — from Cambodia — who enjoyed delicious temple food every weekend. No character was depicted as an immigrant daughter struggling to assimilate to American culture while attempting to preserve their family’s heritage. No character was pictured shopping at Ross in order to make ends meet as an economically-struggling household. No character accurately portrayed my story on screen. 
Attending a predominantly white institution like USC as someone with many intersecting identities, I fear I might never be content with my place at the University. It can sometimes feel demoralizing when you realize how your background, something you have no control over, becomes a disadvantage in your success, closing and opening certain pathways in life.
I didn’t realize the true importance of my identity until I stepped on campus. These identities were once just boxes I checked on documents, but now they actively contribute to changing the status quo. Nor did I consider myself as a writer and join in the University paper’s opinion section because my whole life I never really had opinions. Growing up in my very traditional ethnic household, I was conditioned to believe the action of speaking up is frowned upon and that it was more beneficial for me to remain as neutral as possible. 
Ironically, despite my preaching of activism, I admit to deliberately postponing writing this piece, my first article ever as a new opinion staff writer — as the pressure public perception weighed on me. My relationship with words has always been complex. I often found my words twisting and turning, scrambling out of my mouth in order to form complete, coherent sentences. From learning two languages at once as a child, to the greatest extent my immigrant mother could teach me, communication became my biggest insecurity and weakness. The prevalent hesitancy to share my voice comes down to these simple questions: Do people really care about what I think? What does my voice have to offer?
I realized the unhealthy obsession I have with trying to prove my worthiness on campus, proving to others of my capabilities to “succeed” despite my background. That I was not a pity acceptance. A study in 2020 by Washington State University revealed that first-generation students are more susceptible to imposter syndrome when they feel they are in a competitive environment. And USC has not exactly been the easiest habitat for my identities to thrive in. But what I learned is the majority of this pressure is personally perpetuated. In the same study, in classes students didn’t perceive to be competitive, there was little difference in the levels of imposter syndrome between first-generation students and their classmates. Our capabilities are solely tied to how we view ourselves and first-generation studens become their own deterrent from pursuing opportunities. 
It’s easy to succumb to the thought that no one will understand, but I’ve discovered my greatest refuge is the voices of other students, realizing I am not alone. By being vulnerable and completely authentic about my experiences, I’ve formed unique emotional connections with people who were once complete strangers. It’s healing. Navigating my multitude of identities and the struggles that coincided ignited my inherent interest in advocating for more inclusivity in the media through art. I want to become the storyteller my younger self lacked, in the hope to diminish the feelings of isolation.
I encourage everyone to either write and share their stories or read others to feel more connected to campus. Everyone’s voice has value. It has the power to enrich individual people to abolish larger systemic institutions. There are never enough stories about feeling lost, feeling afraid, or feeling angry. Because despite the possibility of never knowing who the author behind each piece is — seeing, meeting, or talking to them — the connecting point between our lives through their art is magic. Magic I want everyone to be a part of.

Scrolling through social media, you may have noticed that this week is National Eating Disorder Awareness week, which takes place annually during the last week of February. TikTokers who choose to be vulnerable are speaking about their experiences with disordered eating habits while mental health advocacy accounts flood Instagram feeds. But, since social media adheres to the user’s interests and experiences, these essential posts may not have gotten to you. 
Eating Disorder Awareness Week is a time to teach the entire population about the dangers of eating disorders and how to approach them without stigmatization and judgment. It is crucial to broaden who we discuss eating disorders with because it is an illness that can happen to anyone, regardless of age, gender or size. 
According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, nine percent of the United States population has an eating disorder, which is close to the diagnosis rate for diabetes and heart disease. Eating disorders take the lives of one person every 52 minutes with anorexia nervosa being the second deadliest mental health disorder after opioid addiction.
According to Mayo Clinic, anorexia nervosa is characterized by abnormally low body weight due to an intense fear of gaining weight or having a distorted perception of weight. But there are greater dangers to anorexia than the stigmatized image of an extremely thin body. In a study led by dietitian Melissa Whitelaw of the University of Melbourne, they discovered that 31% of patients with anorexia are not underweight — experiencing other severe symptoms affecting organs like the lungs, heart and brain, not just weight loss. 
The lack of nutrients caused by this disorder weakens the lungs, malnutrition also weakens the heart, lowering blood pressure, causes heart failure and sudden death. Neurological effects include loss of brain volume, severe amnesia and confusion. The lack of nutrients in the brain can also cause a negative shift in mood, leading to depression and about 26% of people with eating disorders attempt suicide. 
The human struggle with body image transcends time and place, with even people of the late Ice Age facing the same issues as many today. Society has been setting unrealistic body standards since at least 25,000 years ago when the “Venus of Willendorf” figurine was created in present-day Austria and portrayed a “perfect” woman with a pear-shaped body. Today, social media influencers are normalizing low-calorie diets in “what I eat in a day” videos and appearance-altering filters and surgeries. 
Recognizing the early signs of eating disorders as soon as possible is essential, as symptoms may become irreversible. Some of these early signs are changes in eating habits and social withdrawal. More specific warnings of restrictive eating disorders include talking about calories constantly, excessive exercise and repeatedly weighing oneself. Typical signs of binge eating disorder include chaotic eating habits and the desire to eat in private. 
One of the best ways to help someone with these symptoms is to try to understand their feelings through patience and gentleness. The best thing to do is encourage them to seek professional help so they can work with specialists in the field. Unfortunately, many patients are reluctant to receive help; if they are older than 18, they can only get treatment voluntarily. In this situation, the best thing to do is to contact an eating disorder facility, as they often have the resources to help friends and family intervene with loved ones.  As important as it is to help those who currently have eating disorders, it is equally important to understand how current actions can impact the number of eating disorder patients in future generations. When preventing eating disorders, mundane actions can go a long way. 
Think before you speak. Avoid saying positive things about your or someone else’s body that can encourage them to manipulate their appearance. Similarly, do not talk about dieting or what someone else is eating. Such comments are typically unnecessary and, depending on the person, can cause them to spiral down a dangerous rabbit hole. Parents should avoid commenting on their child’s weight, consider how they portray their body image in front of their child and help them manage their stress. 
The eating disorder epidemic has impacted all types of people for thousands of years, and the only cure is education. Society must understand the dangers of eating disorders, how to help someone find treatment without stigmatization and how to speak to avoid triggering someone who may be prone to an eating disorder. Understanding eating disorders is valuable and should eventually become common knowledge, just like awareness about other epidemics.

USC men’s basketball is preparing for a picturesque postseason push in their final two regular-season games this week against Arizona and Arizona State. In a season filled with ups and downs, the Trojans are hitting their stride at just the right time. They’re currently on a four-game win streak, winning by an average of 19.8 points per game.
“Chemistry is at an all-time high, our offense is flowing, we’re hitting a lot of threes; we’re very cohesive right now,” said fifth-year guard Drew Peterson. “[We’re] hoping to have another good run in the tournament, so we’re locked in.”
Peterson and the Trojans will end their regular season with two games at Galen Center, where they’re nearly perfect on the year. USC is currently on a 14-game winning streak at home, their longest home winning streak since 2016.
But none of that will matter if they can’t get a few more wins down this last-gasp stretch of important games. The Trojans are on the very edge of making it into the NCAA tournament; they have been toting the line of being one of the last four teams in and securing a definite spot in the round of 64. ESPN’s Bracketology currently has USC as a 10-seed right now.
“We hope to finish these two games out, get two dubs here, become second place in the conference and then when we go to the Pac-12 tournament where we get a clean slate,” said sophomore guard Kobe Johnson. “We’ve got to play with that chip on our shoulder, not many people have us in their brackets right now so we’ve got to go out there and prove a point.”
The Trojans may need one more quality win to secure themselves a spot in the tournament, and they have the perfect opportunity on Thursday. USC will face off against the Wildcats for the second time this season, but will hope to play a little closer than they did last time.
In the previous matchup between the two schools, Arizona ran away with the game, winning 81-66. The 81 points USC allowed are tied for the most points they’ve given up in a game all season, thanks in part to the Wildcats’ dominant frontcourt duo.
6-foot-11-inch junior forward Azuolas Tubelis and 7-foot redshirt junior center Oumar Ballo man the middle of this Wildcats team. They are the number one and number two leading rebounders of the Pac-12, but it doesn’t stop there. Tuebelis also leads the Pac-12 in scoring with 19.6 points per game and ranks 34th in the country.
In order to win, USC will have to hinder Tueblis and Ballo in some way. Both players were able to shoot at 50% from the field the last time these two teams played. 
“They both average a lot of points, a lot of rebounds, shot-blocking so they’re very big in the interior,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield when asked about Arizona’s duo. “But they’re two big guys who present challenges because you won’t find two better bigs probably anywhere in the country that are that talented together.”
USC will have to get help from more than just the usual suspects of Peterson and senior guard Boogie Ellis. The Trojans will need extra efforts from some of their younger players that are new to the brighter lights of the conference tournaments and March Madness.
This was a team that came into the year dominated by youth with nine underclassmen on the roster, and many of them will be expected to step up when the moment is the biggest. When asked what he tells his young players when that big movement comes, Enfield’s answer was simple: “This is why you came to USC.”
The Trojans will host Arizona on Thursday at 8 p.m. and close out the regular season against Arizona State Saturday at 8 p.m. at Galen Center.

With the European giants heading down the final stretch of their seasons and dusting off their trophy cabinets for their new hardware, Major League Soccer players and personnel are dusting themselves off to prepare for the start of their season. The league has made it very clear that it wants to change the way the game is perceived in the United States and is doing everything it can to set these young stars up for success. It is a very exciting time for soccer in the U.S., especially after the U.S. Men’s National Team’s better than expected performance in the World Cup and the fact that the nation is getting ready to host the next rendition in four years. Soccer in the U.S. may finally be on the rise.
The 2023 MLS season is bound to be one that all fans can enjoy because six of the seven title contenders are from some of the largest sports markets in the world. LAFC, Philadelphia Union or New York City FC are favored to lift the MLS Cup at the end of the season. Even though LAFC and Philadelphia lost some key players, the teams are primed to meet again. However, after losing three major sports championships in just three months — NFL, MLB and MLS — Philadelphians are hungry for a victory and will surely turn their town upside down if they achieve one.
After having a near perfect season by finishing first in the Western Conference and winning the cup, LAFC has its sights set on a title repeat while improving its position in the U.S. Open Cup — where it fell in the round of 16 last year. It will be a tough task after losing talent like Latif Blessing and Gareth Bale. Carlos Vela, who has been the club’s posterboy ever since he was its first ever signing, looks to lead the team to CONCACAF championship league glory by bringing even more hardware to close the gap between them and bitter rivals LA Galaxy. The two were destined to meet in one of the most prestigious venues in the U.S. until the game was delayed because of rain. Now the two sides must wait until April for their much-anticipated matchup. 
After being a few minutes away from winning the MLS cup final, the Union are still left searching for answers. With many of the players from last year’s team returning, it boasts arguably the best roster in the league. The only weakness that may cause it problems is a lack of depth. Jamaican super sub Cory Burke left the Union for the New York Red Bulls so he can see more time on the field. However, his absence did not seem to affect the squad too much as they put 3 past FC Cincinnati in their season opener.
Fans are in for a treat as they get to witness the introduction of another expansion team, bringing the total number of teams in the MLS to 29. The 29th squad is none other than St. Louis City SC. As expected, its projected to finish in last place at the end of the regular season, but it shocked the league with a victory in its first-ever game Feb. 25 on the road against Austin FC. It was a late 86 minute winner by striker João Klauss de Mello that sealed the victory for St. Louis. It aims to be the first team to win the MLS Cup in its first year since the Chicago Fire did it in 1998. 
The fun will not stop here. League Commissioner Don Garber said at a press conference Wednesday that the league hopes to add its 30th team by the end of 2023, with Las Vegas and San Diego leading the way as top candidates. That would mean an expansion team would be in the league for eight consecutive years. 
To its credit, MLS is doing everything it can to make the game more attractive to spectators, and it’s certainly working. The fan experience is something that I have not experienced anywhere else. Fans stick with their team and truly provide a home field advantage at every one of their 16 home matches.
More and more European talents are setting their sights on the league since it has improved its status compared to where it was 10 years ago. After upsizing like a madman, the league can finally aim its sights on being a ratings competitor against the MLB, NHL and any spring soccer league. Surely, all of these positive trends will allow the U.S. to put a competent and competitive home-grown squad on the World Cup pitch come 2026 … right?

After falling to then-No. 3 Boston College in their first game of the season, the women’s lacrosse team has since won back-to-back games against Ohio State and San Diego State. The Trojans, ranked No. 19 in the country, now look to add another game to the win column when they take on High Point at home on Friday.
“First and foremost the focus is us and just continuing to get better,” said Head Coach Lindsey Munday in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We don’t want to be the same team in February that we are in March or April, so our focus is just getting 1% better every single day.”
High Point is 1-2 on the season with a win against Mount St. Mary’s and losses to Davidson and No. 13 James Madison. Despite their losing record, High Point has had some incredible performances from their squad, including graduate attacker Mena Loescher. Loescher leads the Panthers with 16 points — 8 goals and 8 assists — and just recently scored her 100th career goal. High Point will need another big performance out of Loescher if they want to get back to .500 on the season.
“Our defense is super veteran and they take so much pride in everything that they do, they’ve played really consistently the first three games,” said Munday when asked about her confidence in stopping Loescher. “It’ll be a team effort just like every game, but playing as a unit and playing together.”
The Trojans will rely on the leadership of their veterans, senior attacker Ella Heaney and junior goalie Kait Devir, to lead them to a victory on Friday. Heaney, who already has a Pac-12 player of the week this season, leads the team with 9 points  — 4 goals & 5 assists. She humbly attributed her success to those around her.
“Having great teammates all around you makes everything better,” said Heaney in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “At practice, we are all constantly pushing each other [and] the coaches have been so supportive.” 
Devir, who is giving up just 8.7 goals per game, is the “quarterback” of this Trojan squad. Although she is a junior, she explained how her position as goalie has evolved her into a leader of the team.
“Stepping up and talking to my teammates about what I see and how I can help them get a better read on the field,” Devir said. “As a goalie, your job is to help out your teammates. I might not be scoring on the other end … but talking to my attackers and middies about shooting and little points to help them be successful.”
Both star players and Munday touched on the chemistry of the team: how it has contributed to their success and will lead them to success in the future.
“This team is one of the closest teams that I’ve ever coached. Just the culture and how much they care about each other is honestly really fun to be a part of,” Munday said. “The seniors, the leadership have done a tremendous job just from their freshman year cultivating what they want in a team.”
USC, who went 6-2 at Soni McAlister Field in 2022, won their only game at home this season. They will look to defend their home turf again when they are tested by a talented Panthers team.
The Trojans will take on High Point at 3 p.m. Friday at Soni McAlister Field.

There’s a summer in Atlanta that Lynwood High School girls’ basketball coach Ellis Barfield can’t get out of his head. 
His Nike Elite Youth Basketball Team, the Calstorm Knights, was playing club ball in 2019. It was a grueling trip, with three tournaments in 10 days and a game played almost every day. 
The Knights prevailed, advancing to the Nike Tournament of Champions championship game. Playing a physical team from Maryland, Barfield’s team fell behind early. 
A future McDonald’s All-American wouldn’t let them fold over. Sophomore women’s basketball forward Rayah Marshall put the team on her back as they cut the deficit.
With the game nearing its end, a moment is tattooed in Barfield’s mind. Marshall’s teammate missed a layup, but Marshall tracked down the ball and slammed it back in as it came off the rim. 
“Everybody was like ‘what, that’s a girl that just dunked it,’” Marshall said. 
There was only one problem, though — it didn’t count. 
“The refs, they couldn’t believe it, they didn’t know what to call it,” Barfield said. “They called it basket interference and they took the basket away and the female official was like ‘Wow, does she do this all the time?’ and we were like ‘Yes, she does this all the time.’”
Almost four years later, and though his team won, Barfield still disagrees with the call.
“She caught that off the bounce,” Barfield said. 
But for Marshall, basket or no basket, it was a pivotal moment during a journey where she overcame nearly being unhoused to become a basketball phenom. 
According to her seventh-grade physical education teacher, rumors exist that Marshall was dunking on 9-foot courts in middle school. A year later, she attempted her first dunk in a game before her freshman year. While others slept in on the weekends, she made basketball practice as a seventh grader by catching buses at 5 a.m. 
“When I think back on [playing basketball as a kid], I was like, this is my outlet, this is something I’m good at,” Marshall said. “It was almost like a natural feel for it so I just kept my focus on there and just see where a ball can take me.”
It’s taken her to a road with a way out.  
“This girl’s going to make it”
Born and raised in South Central, Marshall said she lived in a “very harsh neighborhood.” 
At one point growing up, she was on the verge of being unhoused. Marshall lived with her younger sister and cousins in a small apartment, sharing pallets of food. Classmates at school teased her. 
“It was a hard upbringing, well not upbringing, like my entire life, but that part of my life because it was part of my life where I struggled,” Marshall said. “It was hard to adjust to.”
She adjusted by leaning on her faith, with her situation improving as time went on. 
While in the fifth grade, Marshall’s cousin pushed her to play basketball with him and his friends before morning class. The playground became her home.
Two years later in the seventh grade, Marshall’s maturity and ability caught the eye of Damieon Williams, her physical education teacher at Bret Harte Prep Middle School. Williams said she dominated boys on the court and was the best basketball player in the school. 
But Marshall wasn’t serious about the game yet. After Williams returned from overseas basketball, Marshall expressed interest in playing for the first time.
“She started talking about basketball and just her focus in our conversations,” Williams said. “From there I was like, ‘Wow this is a different type of kid, she’s going to make it.’ As long as she gets an opportunity, this girl’s going to make it.”
Williams knew Marshall’s potential. He told Marshall’s mother she had a WNBA player and McDonald’s All-American. In Williams’ mind, if he put her with the right people, everything would work out. 
He took Marshall to Barfield, the head coach of a disciplined program on which missing times for sprints had repercussions. 
“We had workouts and stuff set aside for her and I just seen that she was a special individual, not just basketball-wise, but just her whole mentality,” Barfield said. “She was ahead of her time.” 
Marshall’s work ethic set her apart. She never complained about extra reps, and the way she carried herself was different from others her age, Barfield said. It wasn’t about just saying it for Marshall, but being and doing about it, he said.
Those weekend workouts with Barfield’s travel team proved her seriousness. Practices started at 6 a.m., which meant waking up at 5 a.m. to catch buses. During the week after school, practices reached four hours. 
But she knew no other way. She fell in love with basketball and wanted more of it. 
“I didn’t want to be local, just stuck in poverty,” Marshall said. “I rather have it that way than no other way. I mean I could be sleeping in on weekends and just busy doing nothing, rather than getting up [and] grinding.”
The work paid off. Marshall was a starter on Barfield’s travel team full of high schoolers, playing her up against girls two, three and even four times her age every summer. 
It never mattered. Barfield called Marshall the best player in her position he’s ever coached in his 30 years at Lynwood. 
“She wasn’t afraid,” Barfield said. “She was able to compete and she was always, with the length that she has and her tenacity, she was able to cause a lot of problems on the court.”
Enough problems to catch a future NBA Hall of Famer’s attention. 
“I’m going to the University of…” 
Marshall was “virtually unstoppable” her freshman year at Lynwood when the team reached the CIF-Southern Section Division 2AA finals, ultimately falling to Redondo Union High School. But as the EYBL circuit began during the summer, Marshall’s recruiting offers were dry. 
But the floodgates were about to burst open. 
Playing on Cal Storm Team Taurasi, Marshall was the youngest starter on the team who reached the 2018 EYBL Championship. She dropped a double-double, turning heads and captivating people even in a tight loss — none bigger than 13-time NBA All-Star Kevin Durant. 
“I just remember his facial expression after I made one,” she said. “I cuffed the ball and split through the defense for a layup and he was like ‘What?’ You just see him looking at the statbook [and] he was like ‘Man she’s only a freshman?’”
Durant approached her after the game and told her to stay with it, struggling to comprehend how young and skillful she was.
Then UC Berkeley Head Coach and current USC women’s basketball Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb was in attendance too, and said Marshall was the talk of the gym. 
The showing blew up her recruiting profile during a summer full of breakout games. 
As her game progressed, college coaches followed. Marshall received so many offers, her mom bought her a new phone for recruiters to call. 
On the court, Lynwood didn’t match the success of Marshall’s freshman year. Her sophomore season ended in a second-round CIF-SS exit, and her junior year ended in the second round of state playoffs.  
Then, everything ended. Or so it seemed. The coronavirus halted the world and offered perspective for Marshall as her college decision inched closer. 
Her final three schools were Oregon, Cal and USC, but she always leaned toward the Trojans. The pandemic emphasized the benefits of staying close to home. 
“I don’t know what to expect with [the coronavirus] and my future in college basketball,” Marshall said. “But I don’t want it to be where the airports were shutting down and I can’t see my family. And I didn’t know how much [the coronavirus] would impact our society at the time.”
With her decision made, Marshall scheduled her commitment date before her senior season. She only told her aunt, who sprinkled cardinal and gold confetti into a balloon. 
After giving a speech to friends and family, Marshall stepped toward the balloon. She uttered the words “I’m going to the University of…” and pop! 
The South Central kid was staying home.
“Can we get them something to eat?”
It was Gottlieb’s first year as USC head coach and she was having a rough day. She prides herself on not showing players whether she’s having a bad day or not. But, Gottlieb looked sad and when she went home at night, a familiar number texted her. 
It was Marshall. 
“She said, ‘I know you deal with a lot of things that we don’t see and I just want you to know I’ve got your back, too,’” Gottlieb said. “I was really moved by that because for an 18-year-old to see life through somebody else’s eyes and ask me how I’m doing — that’s another moment that I’ll never forget with her.”
For Gottlieb, it’s difficult to talk about Marshall the player without mentioning Marshall the person — someone who never wastes a moment, is loved by everyone in the women’s basketball department and who even spoke at an all-staff meeting two weeks ago.
During her freshman year, Marshall’s gratitude for a meal plan, housing and being at USC stood out to Gottlieb. 
“I think she’s very appreciative of the opportunities and it speaks to her character,” Gottlieb said.
What she sees on the court, though, is someone who has yet to tap into her potential.
Marshall’s sophomore season saw a jump in her stats all around. She had 5 or more blocks in six games, including a 17-point, 20-rebound and 7-block masterclass against then-No. 22 Arizona. She had her career high in a 33-point, 16-rebound explosion on the road against Oregon State. 
The numbers don’t say so, but college basketball was difficult for Marshall at first, especially in its pace and physicality. Her foundation made a successful transition possible — she never forgot how to compete. 
“[Coach] Ellis taught me how to compete and just be a dog on what I’m good at,” Marshall said. “That’s what I was here to do.”
Even with her on-court success, Marshall always cares about the people around her. 
Though it didn’t last long, being on the verge of homelessness made a lasting impression on her, and Marshall became more sympathetic toward the unhoused population. At times, she even pleaded with her mom to offer old clothes or shoes to people in need.
“I remember going to school coming from just anywhere in my neighborhood seeing people just out on the streets,” Marshall said. “I’d be out in my mom’s car [and] I’d be asking, ‘Can we get them something to eat? I wanna give them these shoes, I don’t wear them anymore.’”
As her career progresses and a professional career becomes near reality, no success or accomplishment is too big for Marshall to change. 
For her, she’s still a kid from South Central.

“I heard, ‘Vince, don’t die on me.’ And that’s when I was like, what the hell are you talking about?” 
On July 1, shockwaves were sent through the college basketball community after freshman center Vincent Iwuchukwu suffered cardiac arrest and was hospitalized during an offseason USC basketball practice. 
Upon seeing the news, thousands of​​ college basketball fans collectively uttered the same sentiment as Iwuchukwu. 
What the hell are you talking about?
The freshman center seemed destined for stardom at USC the moment he signed with the Trojans. 
The No. 25 ranked player in his class according to 247 Sports, Iwuchukwu became the fourth five-star big man in the Trojans’ past four recruiting classes, joining Onyeka Okongwu, Isaiah Mobley and Evan Mobley. Standing at 7 feet tall, Iwuchukwu seemed primed to follow in their footsteps, with the potential to become a Trojan legend and an NBA star. 
That was, until the summer before his freshman year, when Iwuchukwu unexpectedly collapsed and everything — including his life — was suddenly put in jeopardy. 
Fortunately, in a moment of triumph, Vince the Prince rose again. 
“By the grace of God, I came back,” Iwuchukwu said. “I [owe] my life to those coaches and the training staff that were there to help me.” 
The fact that Iwuchukwu was able to regain consciousness in Galen Center and survive cardiac arrest is a testament to the speed and expertise displayed by the training staff that July day. Iwuchukwu’s heart was physically tested to the limit, and it passed. Unfortunately, it would be emotionally challenged plenty more in the coming months. 
“At the time, I was told I wouldn’t be able to play [basketball] again,” Iwuchukwu said. “For about two, three months, [I was] just aimlessly wondering like, what am I going to do?”
After being so close to reaching the next step in his path to the NBA, the possibility of losing the game he loved was devastating for Iwuchukwu. 
“I told my parents … ‘It’s fine … I don’t really need it that much,’” Iwuchukwu said. “After I said that, I just broke into tears. It’s so crazy to think that, [after] four years, I could be attached to something so much. But yeah, a lot of my time has been put into basketball … I hadn’t cried until that point.” 
Fortunately, Iwuchukwu’s prognosis changed: A second doctor said that the first had misspoken, and there was a possibility that he could play again. 
“When I heard that, I just told myself the battle starts now,” Iwuchukwu said. 
And battle he did. For 195 days, Iwuchukwu fought everything that threatened to stall his return to the court. He fought through the uncertainty not knowing of if he could ever return to his former self, the fear that something disastrous could happen again, the tediousness of having to take his recovery inch by inch, the physical exhaustion of ramping up to playing shape after months without physical activity. Yet, he took on that steep road to recovery with a smile on his face. 
“[Iwuchukwu] has had such a positive attitude, so he is very inspiring to all of us,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield. 
That positive attitude is something that Iwuchukwu’s  teammates have taken to heart. 
“His progression has just inspired everybody to overcome,” said fifth-year guard Drew Peterson. “It’s just great to see, and I’m so happy for him and his family.”
For Iwuchukwu, staying upbeat was necessary to keep the faith that he would one day play basketball again. 
“Getting back into [basketball] felt harder to me than the actual event happening,” Iwuchukwu said. “I’ve got to stay positive … My purpose on the team is to help the team win. And whether I’m playing or whether I’m not playing, being positive contributes to winning.”
Just as Iwuchukwu continued to support his new team as much as he could, he had a far older team surrounding him that was critical in maintaining his positivity. 
“[My family], they are my rock,” Iwuchukwu said. “They keep me solid. Every time I feel down, I call my mom and my dad and my sisters and they’re there cheering me up.” 
Iwuchukwu’s teammates’ support has also been huge in his battle back to the court. 
“They were all his biggest cheerleaders when he was trying to go through this to come back,” Enfield said. “They were all there for him when he went through this ordeal.” 
Vince continued to fight with all of his heart. Physically, he fought to be cleared to play. Emotionally, he leaned on the people near to his heart and his own positive personality to stay motivated to return. 
It wasn’t until after Thanksgiving that Iwuchukwu was able to start dribbling a basketball and not until late into winter break before he could fully participate in practice.
“That part was something else, because my body was so out of it for 6 or 7 months,” Iwuchukwu said. “I felt like an old man. I couldn’t move.”
And then, on Jan. 12 in a home game against Colorado, Iwuchukwu was told to go to the scorers’ table to check in for the first time. Thousands of Trojan fans rose to their feet, giving him a hero’s welcome as he stepped onto the court. Finally, triumphantly, he was a Trojan basketball player. 
“I felt like Kobe when he played the Jazz in his last game, that standing ovation was crazy,” Iwuchukwu said. “To get that, it was exhilarating, it was super surreal.”
While everyone seemed to celebrate what was an objectively tremendous accomplishment, Iwuchukwu’s coach made sure his head was in the game.
“[Enfield] told me, ‘Don’t forget your assignments,’” Iwuchukwu laughed.
Following the game, he gave his family a big hug, soaking in what he had accomplished for a brief moment. Then, almost immediately, he got back to work on helping the Trojans compete for a spot in the NCAA tournament. He has become a huge piece of the team since returning, averaging 5.8 points in 13.9 minutes per game and shooting 80% from the free throw line. He scored a career-high 19 points in the Trojans’ loss against Oregon State Feb. 11, his ninth career game.
But no matter what Iwuchukwu and the Trojans accomplish this March, their most meaningful victory has already been achieved. 
Vincent Iwuchukwu’s heart won, in every way.

The world of Archer Defterios is immersed in a luxurious pool of vivid blue. Characterized by large canvases of multi-layered acrylic and oil paint, Defterios is trailblazing a renaissance wave of post-war-inspired art techniques and styles. 
This entrepreneurial triumph and creative freedom is why Defterios, a senior majoring in design, was selected as the Winter 2023 artist for Museum LA, a pop-up art and dinner club in Venice.
The role of nature and the environment takes a front seat in Defterios’ artwork. Contrasting hues of blue create a borderless element and black-hole-like depth to Defterios’ art. Defterios seeks to foster harmony by allowing the harshness of chalking paint strokes to be softened through dripping paint and round dots that mimic planetary terrain. 
“My work wants to push for a lot of industrialization and innovation and the success of other people and other businesses,” Defterios said. “But it also is very in tune with nature and the idea that there’s a fine line between nature and industrialization that we all need to reach.”
Although the color remains a constant in his art style, Defterios has not stopped at blue. Instead, he’s ventured to launching canvases draped in the rich hues of jeweled greens, fiery oranges, noble violets and as of most recent, golden yellows. The most eye-catching feature of it all is the fire that appears on his paintings after dousing the canvas in rubbing alcohol. 
“I like the aesthetic appearance of the monochrome better. I think the monochrome won’t go out of style anytime soon, but that’s not why I do it,” Defterios said. “The idea is that you could put 50 canvases around [a monochrome painting], and that’s just one section, or it could be a section of the canvas. So the idea is that it expands beyond the actual canvas. You’re supposed to imagine this whole texture that consumes or improves the environment that it’s in.”
Defterios explained that setting his canvases ablaze allows for the several hundred layers of acrylic paint to melt away and bring forth the oil paint that bubbles up into fascinating shapes, colors and blemished textures hiding below the surface. 
“I’m using different types of paint, so I’m using water-based paint and I’m using oil paint. When the two mix, it’s kind of like olive oil and vinegar,” Defterios said. “The fire basically will bring the oil to the surface of the canvas, even if it’s buried under 50 layers of acrylic paint. The painting will bubble, and it’ll do different things. The fire brings it all together.”
Design has always been a priority for Defterios’ artwork.  During his internship at a Los Angeles real estate company in 2019, he was motivated to pursue design seriously after the creative director of the company acknowledged his seemingly natural talent in the field. 
After the internship, Defterios came to USC to pursue an education in design and entrepreneurship. One day, Defterios walked into a Blick art supply store to pick up some design materials for a project. 
“There were canvases there and I bought a canvas and I bought a bunch of paint and I blew off the logo project that I had,” Defterios said. “I just painted for like three days straight. I was super obsessed.”
While most beginner painters start small, Defterios started with a large scale painting, unafraid of what the canvas had in store for him. Since then, Defterios has made these very large canvases a part of his brand. 
As a teen and young adult, Defterios spent his time searching for objects in the sand of beaches and chasing waves to capture shots of surfers and the ocean. While spending his summers in Greece, his ancestral homeland, he would experiment with underwater photography — playing with the various lighting fixtures that the underwater environment created.
Defterios never envisioned himself as a painter, but his training in photography, design and his entrepreneurial background complemented each other to build Defterios’s very own brand, Caprice Design. 
Caprice Design is an L.A.-based “visual identity design and branding,” agency that specializes in finding ways to help companies and brands creatively execute their business models. Defterios’ goal is to help bridge the gap between companies and their clients by translating marketing strategies into visual art with graphic design.
“Archer has found a way to perfectly merge art and graphic design in a way where he understands both fields so well that he is able to do a lot more for his clients than just his art,” said Eric Yeich, close friend and videographer for Defterios.
Between his paintings and design agency, Defterios keeps himself busy. Defterios said he hopes to challenge the stigma that artists are just carefree, unmotivated and apathetic. 
“I wake up, paint for hours, then work on design projects on my computer, then back to more painting and then go to my night classes at USC,” Defterios said. “If you work hard, you do well.”  
Defterios’ Winter 2023 collection is on showcase at Museum LA, a dining and art club founded by recent USC graduates. 
David Gelland, a UCLA senior majoring in art history and co-founder and curator for Museum LA, recalled meeting Defterios at a dinner for the Fall 2022 artists. Defterios arrived at Museum LA covered in splattered blue paint, along with an appetite not only for food and negronis, but also that season’s featured artwork. Gelland developed a strong interest in Defterios’ art and visited his studio.
Attracted to Defterios’ commitment to pushing boundaries, he decided to have Defterios as the Winter 2023 artist for Museum LA. 
“He’s impervious to constraints and is energized by the prospect of boundlessness when many would be frozen by it,” Gelland said, “which makes it all the more exciting to see him develop with each piece.”

I used to desperately want to be an idol. As a child, I would make “concert” invitations for all my relatives, handing them out whenever I saw them for my latest show. 
There was no set date. I’d just pick the time that most people (read: family members) could come to maximize the amount of attention I’d receive. I’d dress up in my fanciest sparkly pink outfit from Justice with my little plastic microphone and sing and dance. The small crowd of grudging relatives mostly heard covers of “Hannah Montana” songs.
I loved the attention those moments performing gave me. As I sang and danced, however badly in retrospect, I felt as if my relatives weren’t seeing me as the introverted girl, but me, the star.
I’ve long outgrown the age to be an idol now, but every so often I think about how that desire has shaped me. It’s a subject that I’ve written about before: how loving Chinese idols and consuming what I could of their work affirmed my own pride in my Chinese identity. I also commented on the dangers of worshiping idols to the point where we project our own desires onto them. In short, we don’t view them as real people, but as objects.
This particular theme of idol worship gone too far is a core idea in Satoshi Kon’s 1997 animated film “Perfect Blue.” Perhaps best known for its alleged influence on Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film “Black Swan,” “Perfect Blue,” which follows an idol struggling with the repercussions of her image, is widely regarded as an anime classic. It’s still being written about for its contemporary relevance in a world of digital personas and parasocial relationships with celebrities. These relationships often border on obsession under the guise of real love. 
“Perfect Blue” touches upon these issues through the story of Mima, a J-pop idol who decides to leave the industry to pursue an acting career. However, she soon finds that there is another “Mima” who is blogging from Mima’s “perspective” online, and the real Mima’s psyche begins to deteriorate as a result of the imposter. 
After landing an adult acting role, Mima encounters a crazed fan who is enraged that Mima is supposedly ruining her pure idol image. He sees himself as knowing the true Mima better than Mima knows herself. Mima begins experiencing frightening visions about her persona as an idol and the real her. The condition is made worse when the people around her who are responsible for her career change start getting murdered. 
At the end of the film, Mima discovers that the person behind the murders and the blog was her manager, Rumi. Rumi had become obsessed with Mima’s idol image and developed a delusion that she was Mima, and that the real Mima was the imposter. With this hard-hitting reveal, the film warns audiences about the consequences of obsessive love toward a concept of a person over who they really are.
One lesson we can take away from “Perfect Blue” is that digital personas are a central aspect of idol worship and the formation of those parasocial relationships. Just like fans would read “Mima”’s blog in “Perfect Blue,” I remember watching idol and celebrity vlogs throughout high school. 
I’d find solace in those pieces of an idol’s life during those nights when I’d stay up until 3 a.m. working on pre-calculus problems. In the dead of night, I felt terribly lonely. Hearing my idol talk about their life made me feel less so.
Looking back on it, I thought those idols were my friends. I’d slip into the habit of talking about them as if I knew them or had met them before when I hadn’t. I forgot that they didn’t know who I was. I’d forget that I was just another fan who consumed curated aspects of an idol’s life and thought that was all there was to know about a person. I had ingrained into my mind that watching vlogs and interviews was enough for me to get a real sense of who a celebrity was. 
I tell my friends often about that phase in my life, a connection to idols that stemmed from severe anxiety over my own insecurities. I would watch idols eating food while I was eating at my own desk, wanting so badly to be an idol myself. “Perfect Blue” magnifies those concerns by reflecting how those projections negatively impact idols and contribute to delusions. 
In many ways, I see the same phenomenon today. Below YouTube videos of idols, I spot comments praising the idol’s perfection and their god/goddess status when they’re merely doing everyday, mundane things. I feel like there are forms of Rumis everywhere, myself included, that idealize idols and think we know what’s best for their lives.
Similarly, I cringe at myself for being akin to a celebrity worshiper. There are times when I just have to get the latest celebrity skincare line or want to buy everything that a celebrity lists in a recommendation article. I later reflect on why I want those things and find it’s because I feel like stardom must be contagious. If I use a moisturizer that a celebrity uses, then I must somehow get that same shine, that same glow that oftentimes actually comes from an abundance of fame and money.
If that’s love, then it’s a deeply problematic kind of love. At the same time, our culture makes it so easy to fall into that hole.
What I got from watching “Perfect Blue” was that in an ideal world, idols would be seen as people, not products. In a world where we can distance ourselves from excessively glamorizing celebrities, we can also realize that what we perceive as a person is just a persona, and that the products are just products. The shine of that star dims, and we’re no longer so blinded by the light.

An atomic bomb was dropped on the world of interactive media in February 2022. “Elden Ring” was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. Though it clearly drew from elements of the infuriatingly unforgiving Soulsborne series that FromSoftware is known for, the open world that rivaled the likes of “Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” and “Red Dead Redemption II” complimented the game’s astronomical difficulty. 
As the game flew off the shelves and demolished its competition, it immediately rocketed to cult status within a week of its release. “Elden Ring” offered something that other triple-A titles were cruelly lacking: originality. Every single aspect of this game was incredibly thought out, making it obvious that the developers had poured their heart and soul into what many now consider FromSoftware’s magnum opus. 
Though there are numerous details to praise within “Elden Ring,” such as its clever take on an open world or its creative difficulty regulation, the immediate stand-out is the game’s immersive lore. Written largely by George R. R. Martin — author of “Game of Thrones” — the expansive cosmic lore of “Elden Ring” has been painstakingly fleshed out, spanning a variety of themes such as morality, religion, existence and death. 
With such dedication and diligence sunk into the story of “Elden Ring,” fans are naturally clamoring for more. Luckily, they will get their wish. 
As veteran fans of FromSoftware titles know, installments of the Soulsborne series usually receive DLC — downloadable content — around a year after the game’s original release. In these DLCs, fans can expect a new area, bosses and, most importantly, expanded lore content. Bandai Namco and FromSoftware finally announced an upcoming DLC named “Shadow of the Erdtree,” Tuesday. With this announcement, the companies provided preview art, teasing the expectations of fans. 
There were some outlying discrepancies in the lore of “Elden Ring” that was decoded by theorists and some suspiciously familiar entities in the preview art. They believe that one or more of these plot points could be the catalyst of the game’s inevitable DLC. Here are a few DLC story predictions.
The DLC could take place within Miquella of the Haligtree’s dream
When the Tarnished teleport to the Mohgwyn Palace, they are met with a strange sight in the fiery boss chamber. At the far end of the Parthenon-resemblant temple lies a cracked cocoon with a long, spindly arm emerging from the fracture. This bloodied, lifeless arm belongs to the kidnapped empyrean, Miquella of the Haligtree, brother of Malenia, blade of Miquella. Within the confines of the game’s story, little is known of Miquella and his fate. Unlike other characters, whose destiny is laid out for theorists on a silver platter, Miquella is an anomaly. He is a mystery with no answer.
Due to the lack of information on Miquella, many speculate that the DLC will take place within the lost empyrean’s dream. This would not come as a shock, as FromSoftware is no stranger to the implementation of dream-walking, given the “Bloodborne” DLC partially took place within the Hunter’s Nightmare. As he sleeps within the confines of his flaky cocoon, the Tarnished could enter Miquella’s visions, likely facing him as the final boss of the DLC. The character sitting atop a steed resembling Torrent in the announcement art has a suspicious resemblance to the childlike, blonde empyrean, further supporting the idea that the DLC may center around him. Theorists are praying that FromSoftware expands upon Miquella and his fate, so they can finally put a lid on the mystery of his lore.
Godwyn the Golden may return as a boss
Godwyn the Golden is another character the player sees quite little of throughout “Elden Ring.” The firstborn demigod son of Queen Marika the Eternal, Godwyn the Golden was one of the strongest demigods known in the Lands Between. Unfortunately, the great warrior met his demise during the Night of the Black Knives, slain by Numens who had been equipped with weapons imbued with the rune of death by Lunar Princess Ranni. That night , Godwyn’s soul was extinguished and his body cursed with the lack of a host. The last we hear about Godwyn is his final resting place in the Deep Root Depths, the roots of the Erdtree, as his blighted body slowly infects the region around it.
In the artwork for “Shadow of the Erdtree,” we see the Erdtree black and decaying in the distance. Could this rot of “Elden Ring”’s iconic golden tree have been caused by Godwyn the Golden’s tainted body? If so, there’s a chance the Tarnished may face Godwyn the Golden, now known as the Prince of Death. In facing this boss, players may finally relieve the Lands Between of the blight of Godwyn’s doomed vessel. 
Of course, there’s always a chance that the blackened state of the Erdtree could simply be the result of Melina setting it ablaze in the base game. Whether this is the cause or not, Godwyn still lies at the base of the tree, festering in silence.

Every week, Trojans for Life hosts a table on Trousdale Parkway displaying a sign with a simple question: “Should abortion remain legal?” Passersby place a piece of candy in jars above a green “yes” sign, an orange “it depends/I don’t know” sign or a red “no” sign.
“More one-on-one dialogues are going to be more effective at helping both sides understand each other,” said Morgan Farrier, president and co-founder of Trojans for Life — the flagship pro-life student organization at USC — and a junior majoring in astronautical engineering. “We ask … [abortion-rights supporters] to … clarify their views and ask questions to try and understand where they are coming from.”
Throughout the 50 years since the Supreme Court released its Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, conversations about abortion and reproductive rights have been at the forefront of college campus discussions. Anti-abortion students at USC celebrated the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, but they knew that, on a state level, they still had to work overtime to make their views a reality. A University of California, Berkeley poll released August showed 68% of Californians who were eligible to vote disapproved of the overturn, and just under 67% of voters in November supported embedding reproductive rights into the state constitution.
“We’re a very small club,” Farrier said. “We live in California on a college campus, so a lot of students disagree with our opinions. We have a lot of members that are not really comfortable with tabling, or they don’t want to be outed for their views.”
In California, safe abortions remain legal. But Logan Terry, co-director of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, said she does not take these rights for granted and fights to ensure students’ continued access to abortions and related resources. As part of its efforts, SAGE started a series of monthly talks on sexual education in a post-Roe United States, said Terry, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and international relations.
“That has changed a lot of the discussions we have,” Terry said. “Fortunately, in California, we have a lot of reproductive justice, safety nets and options for people. But in other states, that’s not the same, so we are at the heart of that.”
I consider myself to be open-minded about abortion. I’m pretty confident in my pro-life beliefs, but I’m open-minded in the sense that if I’m wrong, I want to know. I want to believe the truth, whatever it is, and so I think a thing that both sides can agree on is that in the pursuit of truth, dialogue is really important.
SAGE offers a space for students to receive information on reproductive care and reach the nearest abortion clinics, Terry said. Terry’s co-director Celia Bartel and assistant director Emilee LeVeque also make themselves available for one-on-one discussions. Through its speaker events, SAGE highlights the efforts of activists who secure reproductive justice inside and outside of Los Angeles. 
“We believe that the overturning of Roe v. Wade was heinous,” Terry said. “People who, historically, are well off financially or able to move from state to state are going to be able to secure abortions [or] birth control, whereas people who are queer, people who are Black, people who are not necessarily identifying as women are going to have a harder time navigating these systems.”
The USC Survivor Support Community provides similar resources and monthly dialogues that specifically address abortion and intimate healthcare for survivors of sexual assault. 
“Human rights issues are becoming very political issues,” said Christine Almadjian, director of advocacy at SSC, referring to discussions of abortion. “There is a dichotomy between those two things, and I think that we forget that because we see such polarization between groups of people. … They’re bodily-autonomy issues, and they’re issues that apply to survivors and allies of survivors.”
In an open conversation night held Jan. 25, the week of the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, SSC members discussed legal resources, insurance options, support groups for students and organizations offering compensation for abortions. Opening the event, Almadjian spoke on the importance bodily autonomy holds for survivors.
“[Bodily autonomy] is something that a survivor wants to reclaim. It’s something that they want to have a grasp on again,” said Almadjian, a senior majoring in law, history, and culture. “With Roe v. Wade being overturned, we felt that, as a right, was completely disregarded within the highest law of the land.”
But the term bodily autonomy holds a different connotation in anti-abortion circles: Rebecca Carlson, dialogues and outreach director at Trojans for Life, argues the same standards should apply to fetuses.
“Our country has done an abysmal job of protecting it in many ways, particularly for women and for other minorities over the course of the centuries,” said Carlson, a graduate student studying philosophy, during the club’s “Abortion Dialogues 101” meeting. “As important as bodily autonomy is, it doesn’t extend to the right to kill another innocent person.”
Carlson teaches about both anti-abortion arguments and abortion-rights arguments to give members background information on how to respond to abortion-rights talking points. She said members should hold conversations in a way conducive to productive dialogue instead of making people feel attacked. 
Members also conduct these conversations with the understanding that Trojans for Life is a single-issue organization and does not claim any religious or political beliefs. Still, most Trojans for Life members are Christian or Catholic.
“I consider myself to be open-minded about abortion,” Carlson said. “I’m pretty confident in my pro-life beliefs, but I’m open-minded in the sense that if I’m wrong, I want to know. I want to believe the truth, whatever it is, and so I think a thing that both sides can agree on is that in the pursuit of truth, dialogue is really important.”
Even with the intent of a genuine conversation in mind, though, Almadjian said she feels that Trojans for Life’s approach may not come off as intended to passersby.
We believe that the overturning of Roe v. Wade was heinous. People who, historically, are well off financially or able to move from state to state are going to be able to secure abortions [or] birth control, whereas people who are queer, people who are Black, people who are not necessarily identifying as women are going to have a harder time navigating these systems.
“I did my best to just try to listen to what they’re saying,” Almadjian said, recounting her own experience speaking with Trojans for Life members at their table. “I haven’t had a negative experience with them … but I can definitely see why it could be triggering for people and why people are apprehensive [about] having that conversation, just like smack in the middle of Trousdale.”
The USC Catholic Caruso Center promotes its own anti-abortion message to congregations: Last semester, the church distributed pamphlets expressing its opposition to Prop 1 — the proposed amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the California constitution — in its pews. 
“We want to be caring first and then allow for an inclusive environment, but also at the same time emphasize that these are church teachings,” said Juan Pablo Moreland, missions chair at the CCC and a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics,, and economics. “We hope to abide by that — and I think there’s a strong, strictly moral case to be made against abortion.”
Anti-abortion organizations are also taking a more head-on approach to their advocacy: Moreland has worked with the CCC to organize anti-abortion marches and send students to One Life LA, an anti-abortion march held yearly in L.os Angeles. Similarly, Trojans for Life crowdfunds to send members to the March for Life in Washington, D.C.
Terry, who herself has organized and attended abortion-rights protests, said the charged environments created by protests and counter-protests made productive discussion more difficult.
“I don’t want to prescribe a general solution, because everybody has to come from a place that’s comfortable for them,” Terry said. “If you have the patience to inform people, then I think that’s a really good thing. But I don’t think we should be expecting every single person to have the space and the patience to want to bring up these … difficult issues with people who fundamentally disagree with them.”
