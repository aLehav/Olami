The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Saturday, Sept. 8 and Sunday, Sept 9. 
Crimes against a person
at 8:52 p.m. on Sept. 9, a student reported that he was struck in the arm by a bottle that was thrown from Jefferson Boulevard and Orchard Street while he was walking near the location. The student did not know who might have thrown the bottle and did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter.
Crimes against property
at 8:22 p.m. on Sept. 9, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect prowling bicycles near 2833 Menlo Ave., but were unable to locate him during a subsequent search of the area. An unsecured and unattended bike was recovered at the scene and turned in to DPS’s lost and found after the owner could not be located.
at 11:19 A.m. on Sept. 9,  a student reported that he discovered his wallet was missing and subsequently learned that a suspect had used his ATM card to make an unauthorized withdrawal from his bank account.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 8:22 p.m. on Sept. 9, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who passed out on the ground near 30th Street and Orchard Avenue. The student was unresponsive when contacted by the officers, so an LAFD RA unit was requested. RA Unit #15 responded and examined the student, then transported her to Olympia Hospital for medical treatment.
at 11:43 p.m. on Sept. 8, DPS officers on routine patrol were flagged down by a non-USC male who complained of a loud party at 1150 30th St. The officers contacted the student hosting the party, who then turned off the music and moved his guests indoors without further incident.
The mere fact that USC insists on buying into the racist template of a police state “roundup” and printing it in their euro-centric mouthpiece the Daily Trojan shows how far we have to go before people of color are treated equally at this University.  USC was invested in South Africa as late as 1993!  Yes, 1993.  Students of color are asked for ID just like the former apartheid state.  Sister!  We have more serious matters than your drinking to address before justice prevails.
Lol!
I am very unhappy with the sexist language used in the Roundup section.   Do you notice whenever they find some person passed out they insist on mentioning it is a woman (“her”).   They never do this with men.   Let me guess, men are better drinkers and don’t pass out on the sidewalk.  I beg to differ!
Is this a joke?
I will be damned.  This comment goes right up on the site.  While my comment is awaiting moderation.  Moderation!  There ain’t nothing moderate about the truth.

A new pilot program that offers gender-inclusive housing on a LGBT-themed floor has been dubbed a success, according to Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center.
According to Vigil, the program, which was approved last March, aims to make the LGBT-themed Rainbow Floor in Century Apartments more inclusive for transgender or gender-variant students.

A gender-inclusive option currently exists in two apartments on the floor. Participants live in rooms with students who identify with the same gender but share the apartment with students of all genders.
Elizabeth Soriano, a junior majoring in communications who lives on the Rainbow Floor, said living in one of the gender-inclusive apartments has improved her USC housing experience.
“It’s a really good experience so far because I’ve had previous experiences with housing…and compared to this housing experience, I feel like I’m in a better place,” Soriano said.
Vigil said so far, residents of the gender-inclusive apartments have had positive experiences.
“The rooms have not had any major conflicts as of now,” Vigil said.
He went on to say that though the pilot program is new for USC, many universities already offer comparable housing options.
“Other institutions have been doing something similar on their LGBT-themed floors for years,” Vigil said.
Kevin Steen, the floor’s resident adviser, said the gender-inclusive apartments integrated smoothly into the rest of the building.
“It has really added to the diversity of the floor and has really legitimized our movement toward gender-friendly housing at USC,” Steen said. “The Rainbow Floor is really a reflection of the community, and USC really leads the way in terms of movements and changing mentality.”
Soriano said living in a gender-inclusive apartment and on the Rainbow Floor is preferable to past housing options.
“It makes me feel much more comfortable to know that identity won’t be a factor with any conflicts that would rise up among my apartment mates,” Soriano said. “So far, it’s been great.”
Other California universities, including Stanford, have made the shift to offer gender-neutral housing. Gender-neutral housing allows students to live in the same room, regardless of their gender identification, as opposed to gender-inclusive housing, which allows students of opposite sexes to live in the same apartment but not the same bedroom.
“This transition toward gender-inclusive housing is a way for USC to make the Rainbow Floor more inclusive and create a safe environment,” Vigil said. “This was not a move to make the USC campus gender-neutral.”
Vigil said in order to make the shift, the university would have to invest many resources to renovate the current traditional-style dorms and build gender-neutral bathrooms where each stall and shower is enclosed from floor to ceiling. He also said that the case for adopting gender-neutral housing must come from the students.
“At Stanford, student government put petitions together and took surveys of the student body,” Vigil said. “In order to have gender-neutral housing at USC, students need to advocate for it. Just like every other issue on campus, students need to move it forward.”
Though there has not been a huge push for gender-neutral housing so far, Steen said he feels encouraged by the response the program has received.
“I’ve had members of the Greek community and people in Residential Education checking in with me to see how its going, so I feel like we have a lot of support,” Steen said.
A wider-reaching program would come at a great benefit to students, Soriano said.
“I feel like it would be great if it could be expanded, the Rainbow Floor included,” Soriano said. “I feel like a lot of other people can benefit more than I can currently.”

Students at USC have the resources of the Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government to represent their collective opinions, work on solving issues and stay connected with the university. Faculty members too have their elected leaders as resources.

Dr. Charles J. Gomer, who was recently elected vice president of the USC faculty for the 2012 school year, said he wants to ensure that all USC faculty members’ voices are heard.
“In the past years the university has finalized far-reaching strategic visions,” Gomer said. “Now each school will use that vision in setting their own goals in moving forward … [I] will check and see how they’re doing and if there are things we can do or items we can provide them with.”
As vice president, some of Gomer’s responsibilities will include running the Academic Senate, which consists of representatives from all the USC schools, sitting in on the faculty and USC Trustee committee meetings and helping each school achieve their strategic plans. He will also continue to serve on the Appointments, Promotions and Tenure Committee for the USC Keck School of Medicine and as vice chair of Faculty Affairs in the Department of Pediatrics.
Gomer will also serve as the faculty’s president-elect for the 2013 school year. The president of the USC faculty works on strategic planning and overall vision, but Gomer said he hopes to work on “enhancing the existing communication and outreach to all faculty so they know there is a voice for them.”
Gomer, however, won’t only be focusing on the faculty. As president, he wants to work more with USC students to improve the graduate student program and distance learning, which the university has a significant investment in for the future.
Another student issue that Gomer wants to tackle during his time in office is sustainability.
“The opportunities for USC to move forward in areas of sustainability and environmental friendliness are tremendous,” Gomer said. “This is an area that we know many of our students are actively involved in.”
Gomer was a prestigious recruit for USC. Before coming to Keck, he completed his undergraduate and graduate education in biology at State University of New York at Buffalo — the same graduate school as President C. L. Max Nikias — for a portion of his studies. When it came time to narrow his field of study, Gomer chose radiation biology because of his personal ties to the field.
“Cancer runs in my family,” Gomer said. “I decided to go into a program that focused on cancer. It allowed me to do things I learned at the lab bench, basic research and understanding processes, but what was really nice is that I was able to work with other clinicians and scientists to move some of these [processes] into the clinic.”
Through his research, Gomer has been able to develop new therapies for retinoblastoma, a rare eye cancer that develops in early childhood. After working in New Mexico at National Laboratories, which was part of the atomic bomb and radiation-focused Manhattan Project during World War II, Gomer was recruited to work for USC to develop expertise in using lasers and radiation therapy to treat eye tumors.
On top of his new duties, the scientist will continue to do research at the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles and to instruct the medical residents there and at Keck in radiology.
Perhaps the area that Gomer is most known and appreciated for at USC is his mentoring. The recipient of the USC Mellon Foundation Culture of Mentoring Award and the USC Provost’s Award for Mentoring, Gomer said helping others achieve their goals and work up to their full potential has always been one of his passions.
“What was very fortunate for me was that I had an outstanding mentor when I got into graduate school who was an outstanding scientist himself, but who also took the time to work with me and to mentor me, and to allow me to do some risky things with research that ended up panning out very well,” Gomer said.
Once he arrived at USC, Gomer was determined to give back to others in the same way that he had once been helped.
“I was asked a while ago to set up mentoring programs for new faculty members [at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles],” he said. “I was very much wanting to do this … it’s a way to give back because I was so fortunate.”
As part of his new program, Gomer helped create workshops on career development, presentations and writing in order to help faculty gain new and valuable skills. In addition, all new faculty members are paired with a team of members from their field of interest.
“What really makes USC special … is that over the past decade they have developed a culture of mentoring,” Gomer said. “They reward good mentoring by faculty members. They want faculty to work with students and new faculty to help them succeed … USC does it very well and provides a lot of resources.”

A research seminar conducted by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism concerning the evolution of digital literacy worldwide was held Monday in the Geoffrey Cowan Forum.
The seminar featured Cal State San Bernardino Professor Mihaela Popescu, whose research interests include Internet governance, communication history and the relationship between media policy and cultural capital.
Digital literacy · Cal State San Bernardino Professor Mihaela Popescu presents research on how Internet-savvy different cultural groups are at an Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism event Monday. – Shoko Oda | Daily Trojan
Popescu’s discussion pertained to the challenges society faces in the global digital age as countries begin to envision a pro-digital learning environment.
“We know that new literacies are shaped by conditions associated with socioeconomic status,” Popescu said. “We have cause to believe that the lack of certain digital literacy competency may widen the knowledge gap that already exists along fault lines such as gender, race and income.”
Popescu illustrated the interconnectedness between the effective use of digital technologies and social, economic and cultural capital. She presented data from research she conducted in 2005 on patterns of internet consumption in different cultures in Southeast Europe, particularly in Romania.
According to her research, the level of Internet usage by particular groups of people is dependent on social class — high, upper status sections of economic and civic capital tend to be more frequent users of digital technologies in contrast to the lower status segments of populations.
“Internet use is very much dependent on class,” Popescu said. “Diffusion of digital literacies in Romania is highly stratified.”
Raffi Sarkissian, a Ph.D. candidate studying communication, found Popescu’s research interesting, noting the fact that more data collection on the topic of internet usage among younger demographics might provide more context in terms of analyzing how digital literacy is intertwined with cultural capital.
“I’d be interested in seeing the shift in data because huge internet phenomena, such as Facebook and Youtube, came after 2005,” Sarkissian said. “I’d be curious to see how that has shifted internet usage, especially among young demographics.”
Adam Kahn, a fifth year Ph.D. candidate studying communication, also said the research could provide interesting insights into other cultures for college students at a technologically advanced school like USC.
“I’m working on a project about integrating digital literacy skills into large lecture courses and whether that courts over to other schools that aren’t necessarily as fortunate as USC,” Kahn said. “It’s very interesting to observe how a country with low internet penetration such as Romania compares with parts of the U.S.”

The Pac-12 featured USC and Oregon as consensus top-five teams entering 2012, but only one other team appeared in the Associated Press top-25 poll -— Stanford at No. 21. And only Washington garnered any mentions in the “Others receiving votes” category, which effectively ranked the next 19 teams.
Now, after last Saturday’s games, the conference is much better represented in the poll, with five ranked teams — USC at No. 2, Oregon at No. 4, Stanford at No. 21, UCLA at No. 22 and Arizona at No. 24. Oregon State and Arizona State also earned notice with 77 and 10 points, respectively.
The upward movement resulted from a weekend in which each of these teams, except Oregon, defeated opponents from BCS automatic qualifying conferences, including three upsets of ranked schools.
The conference’s weekend showing wasn’t completely positive, however, as its newest members Colorado and Utah both lost to significant underdogs, and Washington was beaten handily by No. 3 LSU, 41-3.
Oregon stayed at No. 4 in the poll, but its secondary suffered a substantial loss when news broke early Sunday morning that senior safety John Boyett needed to undergo season-ending knee surgery to repair partial tears of both patellar tendons. With 278 career tackles and 10 interceptions, he is one of the premier safeties in the nation.
Boyett, a 2011 Pac-12 first-team selection, played in Oregon’s opening 57-34 win over Arkansas State, registering an interception. He did not dress for last Saturday’s 42-25 win over Fresno State.
“The hope was, through different treatments and certain types of rehab during this past offseason, [my knees] would heel up and I’d be ready to go for my senior year,” Boyett said in a prepared statement to the Napa Valley Register. “But unfortunately, it didn’t work out as planned.”
Boyett has yet to decide whether, following his recovery, he will declare for the 2013 NFL draft or apply to the NCAA for a medical hardship waiver that would allow him to return to Oregon for another year.
In other Pac-12 injury news, Utah coach Kyle Whittingham announced Monday that starting senior quarterback Jordan Wynn will retire from football following a left shoulder injury he suffered last Friday night in an overtime loss to Utah State.
There’s a possibility his injury will require surgery, which would mark Wynn’s fourth shoulder surgery since 2009.
Wynn starred as a freshman, capping his season by earning MVP honors in Utah’s Poinsettia Bowl victory. But injuries soon took their toll, as Wynn managed to start a mere 14 combined games from 2010-11.
Wittingham will name his new starting quarterback at some point this week. The two primary candidates are senior Jon Hays and freshman Travis Wilson.

I almost wrote this column two years ago.
I wanted to respond to the launch of the Lost Angeles blog, the brainchild of 29-year-old Zack Jerome. The blog went on to spawn an on-campus “Arrogant Nation” movement, which I wanted to point out perpetuated the outdated stereotype that USC was stocked with bigheaded rich kids.
The Bearfighter · “Arrogant Nation” founder and Lost Angeles blogger Zack Jerome emceed the Fall 2012 Sports Rally at the Galen Center. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Then the wave of T-shirts reading “You Can’t Sanction The End Zone” and “Bowls Are For Salad” hit Saturday tailgates and flooded my Facebook newsfeed. At first, it irked me, but I waited, with my pen tucked away — or more accurately, my keyboard.
Oddly enough, the popular site grew on me. It made sense.
Eventually, I decided to contact Jerome, a 2005 USC graduate, to research a column I was writing about the blog and his message. Eventually, I would concede the following: His blog was a remedy — in fact a powerful one — for distraught fans in the wake of NCAA sanctions that kept USC out of the postseason for two years. That was important, so I listened, which is what they teach you in journalism school nowadays.
“I didn’t want people to get down on the fact that we couldn’t win a fake national championship,” Jerome explained to me.
He was right, and his message fit its niche to a T. The students, the alumni and the fanbase needed a sort of rallying point in the face of what were, at the time, the harshest sanctions since the 1987 SMU Death Penalty.
“I am here to re-focus the Nation of Troy on the eve of battle,” Jerome wrote in his first post prior to the 2010 season. “I am here to explain to you what this season is about and why you need to push for it.”
Amid probation, this fanbase faced an existential crisis, wondering openly if playing games even mattered if the Trojans couldn’t land in a January bowl game.
Jerome and the newborn “Arrogant Nation” resoundingly answered, “Yes.” That was the site’s impact. That’s why it was made, and because of that, its value shouldn’t be understated.
Fast-forward two years later: Circumstances paint a brighter picture for the football program. Though USC, as coach Lane Kiffin so often puts it, is playing with 10 fewer guys this season, it’s ranked in the top five of virtually every top-25 poll imaginable. Its quarterback is the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy, college football’s most prestigious and coveted individual award. And seemingly all offseason long, media members and fans alike heaped praise at the feet of Kiffin for “beating the sanctions.”
So for all intents and purposes, USC boasts a good football team again, which begs the question: Do we still need an arrogant nation? Do we need a unifying message for fans and students that chastises an opposing team’s mascot for “looking like a pedophile,” as many did last week in reference to Otto the Orange, Syracuse’s mascot?
Spoiler: This all screams patented, good ole ’SC snobbery — a stereotype that’s subsided but one that will always be tough to shake.
“UCLA is the nice school and USC is located in a sh-t dump and populated exclusively by dumb rich kids,” wrote Deadspin’s Drew Magary earlier this month. “It’s the SMU of the Pacific region.”
Of course, this is Deadspin, Gawker Media’s sports site which is always a little tongue-in-cheek, but that perception still very much lingers.
Unfair? A bit, yes. But, of course, it doesn’t help when arrogance, more or less, has become the unwritten manifesto for the student body rooting on an undefeated, second-ranked football team, winner of its last six games spanning to last November.
It also doesn’t help when the athletic department props up Jerome in front of students at various rallies, which encourages that same tiresome manifesto of arrogance.
USC is above that.
Arrogance is far from pride — what fans and students should instead save for their school. Arrogance is flashing your middle finger at someone wearing opposing colors. Pride is raising two fingers to say “Fight On” to players after an impressive performance, or a return trip from Haiti after building houses for earthquake victims.
The difference, however small, is also stark.
During the bowl ban years, arrogance didn’t exactly move the needle much as USC mostly puttered around outside the top 25. It was a way to hang on.
But now, as the wins and the wins by double digits pile up, the line between the two blurs.
So in the interest of clearing up the confusion and creating some civility, it’s not, “Fight The F-ck On.” It’s just “Fight On.” It’s not “Arrogant Nation.” It’s the “Trojan Family.”
It’s time we admit it.

Amen.  Agree with this article completely, and I’m so glad you gave some voice to reason.
As a slightly older alum (class of 2003) who lives in Austin, TX, for me the point of Arrogant Nation (at least what I valued about it) was that it was a way to completely disarm the haters. Living in Austin during sanctions was brutal – every time you wore your USC shirt it was “cheater” this and “cheater” that. You couldn’t watch the game at a bar because no bar would change the TV for you if anything Texas-related was on.
The whole Arrogant Nation shtick gave us ammo. Instead of constantly being on the defensive, constantly deferring to the criticism and laying low, we were able play the greatest role of all – the contrarian who gets under everyone’s skin. Every time they would say something we would double down on our greatness. We would play the heel on purpose and MAN, people hated that. It got on everyone’s nerves that, at a time where we should have been contrite and deferential we were proud and defiantly awesome. 
I would say AN is necessary as long as people hate USC. And that will ALWAYS be the case, no matter how much kindness we throw at them, no matter whether our coach is Lane Kiffin(the most hated coach in the NCAA) or someone everyone loves like Bill Snyder. Haters gonna hate, and nothing gets haters more frustrated than a heel who doubles down and refuses to give an inch, who can spin every negative into a positive. It’s made being a USC alum in Austin bearable, and for those of us who don’t live in cozy Trojan country Arrogant Nation remains relevant and indispensable. 
Anyway, something you might not have considered when writing the article. It’s easy to forget what life is like outside the Trojan home base.
USC is definitely not the only school to act arrogantly, we’re just the ones who own up to it. Many of my close friends at rivals schools do not hesitate to flash a middle finger at me in response to a perfectly civil facebook status applauding our team and celebrating a recent win. In fact, I’m commonly one of the only people in football discussions to acknowledge even a single redeeming quality in our opponent’s team and their performance. Yes, we are arrogant, but so are they
That being said, I think we still need our arrogant nation. We may be ranked in the top 5 in every important poll imaginable, but we have yet to prove ourselves. We’ve been ripped on and torn down for the past two years, and we’ll still feel the effects of the santctions well into the future. We deserve an opportunity to say a big “f*ck you” to the NCAA, and this season is our chance to show why we deserve to say it. To show that our arrogance is about more than just spite, that it’s because we really are that good
This season should be the peak of our arrogance. What could be more so than coming out of two years of sanctions, with 10 fewer of our guys on the field than any of our opponents, then rushing headlong into the post-season undefeated, with a Heisman winner leading the charge?
The time for pride will come. In fact I think it’s already here. But that doesn’t mean we can’t use a little arrogance, too.
So true. Living in Texas you see real, nasty arrogance all the time, from Texas homers and Oklahoma people and Alabama people, people who lash out at you because football is all they have. It’s really sad. They hate you because they know you have it better, and when football is involved they can’t stand it when we win because football is supposed to belong to them.
Thank you for having the courage to write this.
Wow Joey, really? This blog was the battle cry for our beat up program. Jerome not only rallied the troops, but he gave us a great laugh to lighten the load.  He’s BRILLIANT!  Have you ever attended a game?  Doesn’t seem like you have.  Perhaps grad school at ucla is your next step.
Just returned from Madison and experienced Camp Randall……the students have a a chant that goes, “EAT SH*T, F**K YOU!” Arrogance is everywhere…..
I remember my freshman year at USC.  Trojan spirit had ebbed for a moment, so the administration took away the 50-yard-line seats that had traditionally been the right of the students and sold them to ticket-payers.  Now that we are back on top, we need someone to stir up the pot more than ever.  
Trojan students are fickle.  Remember: a significant portion of our students are international students, and they don’t necessarily have the same fanaticism for the Coliseum that we do.  Then, we have the graduate students, who sometimes (one once proudly told me), can’t even find good-ol’ Tommy Trojan.  That leaves a small, select group of individuals charged with carrying forth the mythos of Troy, like Aeneis.  And those few students have many other concerns.  No longer does legacy easily carry you into this school.  No, the individual that sees the inside of Doheny is often the Renaissance Youth, one who carries the school on shoulders by way of leadership, scholarship, and constitutional vigour.
These visionaries themselves need a leader.  They need a reason to return to the Coliseum, to tap into that heritage that connects use to our ancient Hellenic roots.  Without a vision, the people perish.  If Arrogant nation fades away now, the symbol of our school–of our intellectual, athletic, and entrepreneurial dominance in every other arena.
You’re not calling for our flag-bearer to lower our flag simply because we’re not retreating.  You’re asking that we apologize for our Olympic medals, for our contributions to science and academia, for the leaders that we’ve fashioned, for the film makers and reporters we’ve fashioned for the screen, and for our meteoric rise in the rankings.  We all know that success breeds envy, and it’s the envy you’re responding to.  You’re asking that we stop succeeding.
Joey,  
Sorry but I could not dissagree more with you regarding Zack’s blog.  Zack is a blessing to us and in my opinion, this year will be the most important year of Arrogant Nation.     
As a long-time Trojan fan and alum (1989) I can only surmise that you have not been around long enough to buy into the whole “Being a Trojan” thing yet.  I hope at some point you will embrace it and be proud.  I’d like to share a quote about USC from Sports Illustrated that was published back in 1988 (when I was still a student).  For me, this article wonderfully articulated the Trojan “sprit” (arrogance?).  
Being A Trojan 
“Of course it is only a game, but somehow the Trojans, bursting out of that stadium tunnel, have come to stand for a way of life. The sight of those USC teams rolling across the Coliseum grass, dominating their opponents – and without a single penny of government aid that the UCLA’s and Oklahomas and Nebraskas depended on, damn it. All of it happened, year after year because the school annually turned out a phalanx of new achievers, men who pulled themselves up by the bootstraps and went on to be the cream of their crops and the captains of their industries, men who started companies and expanded businesses that created jobs and took people off the welfare rolls, men who took care to plow back their superabundance into the institution that launched them, so that the Trojan tradition of independence and excellence would go on and on. Yes, the sight of that wave of cardinal and gold articulates everything. Maybe you cannot comprehend that. But a Trojan can. It is a little like being a Marine. You know you are one of the elite.”
– Sports Illustrated, November 28, 1988; Gunning for No. 1
I started my USC education in 1984.  I was not rich; I worked my way through school, just like my older brother did.  We were both members (and years later, so was our sister) of the Trojan Marching Band, and we were all arrogant!  
One of the main characteristics we loved about both the band and the school was, and still is, its arrogance.  Whatever walk of life we come from, no matter what is happening with Trojan football, we all embrace it & stick it back in your face.  Especially if you don’t like it!  
Zack Jerome captures this perfectly.  If you don’t like his blog, don’t read it.  No need to stab a brother in the back; at least not in MY Trojan Family.  FTFO
Stop being so PC, it’s boring and something Cal would do.
The only self-righteous snobbery I see is from the writer of this column… Who cares what someone from deadspin said – get a life kid.
I’m a Trojan Grandma and really don’t get why this blog should suddenly “go away” right now.  I find it very entertaining, hysterical and well written.  It should stay as long as there is an interest in reading it.
http://lostangelesblog.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/daily-trojan-thinks-its-time-for-me-to-go/
#FTFO
“I love Arrogant Nation and everything that it stands for, because it was there when we needed it most. You don’t turn your back on someone who’s helped you through the rough patches, do you? ”
and
““your proposal to separate us is frankly the antithesis of what a family is.”
I read arrogant nation religiously, it’s entertaining and reminds me just how awesome USC, it’s alumni, and it’s fans are, the only thing about the blog I haven’t liked is the link to this article. Moving forward I know now that any link to this site, I won’t go to or read. You can do the same, if you don’t like the blog, don’t read it/
If you’re going to be called arrogant, regardless of the truth of the situation, you might as well own it. And as many others said, the bearfighter brings a levity to a long week. He gives you something to look forward to (other than an amazing football game). He was our hope and spirit when we should have broken down. Quite honestly, we owe the last two years and our status today to Zach and Matt Barkley. Barkley fought for his teammates and Zach fought for our fan base. Together they created arrogant nation and gave hope to a group who didn’t know what to think. So thank you for your opinion, but in the future, please keep it to yourself. If you don’t like it, don’t read it.
I honestly cannot even put into words how much this article disgusts me.  I never liked the Daily Trojan when I was a student mostly because the articles were either poorly written or about some new ultra alternative rock CD and how it did not live up to expectations even though I always thought having heard of it was a crowing achievement. I remember one article in particular about the UV and how we should not get rid of it…just wow…  However, this article appears to be a new low.  For a “writer” to attack a comedic blog with more logical fallacies then a political speech is simple embarrassing.  I am honestly very glad that I no longer am a student so that I don’t have to read this slop just to get to my crossword puzzle.  Fight On Arrogant Nation! and dont let party poopers like Joey here stop you from having fun this football season!
everyone is missing the point….  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE BACHELOR RECAPS!?!?!?!?
Sorry I cannot cite this properly, oh wait it was in The DT!?!? —>
‘As a self-proclaimed believer in Gonzo journalism, a style of journalism that does not claim objectivity, Jerome supports outlets for the reporter to be part of the story, which allows him to write freely. “What won’t go away is the human need to connect,” Jerome said. “It’s a gift to have writers people want to read.”,
If the referendum is on Gonzo journalism (which today is not well executed, and yes he is no Thompson but Zack applies his “hell with a pen” brilliantly) then call it as such.  I understand it’s an Op/Ed piece but your opinion sucks and your editorial prose is much less than compelling. Sorry dude, FAIL. 
(Emphatically) #FTFO!
ftfo
Its supposed to be Trojans helping Trojans. We have always supported each other, its has always been our greatest strength. AN has instilled more of the Trojan values than the DT ever will.
While most of your writing for the Daily Trojan has been off base, I never wanted to comment for fear you would think someone was reading your articles and be encouraged to continue.  Get a sense of humor and back away from your pen.
Nothing to add that hasn’t been said above. It’s depressing that you (Joey) “almost wrote this column two years ago”. That the thought ever crossed your mind then is unfathomable.
Zack, with you 110%. Keep being hell with a pen.
#FTFO WE ARE SC
you suck man. trying to rip the school its pride? have you ever even been to a USC football game?
I copied and pasted this from a reader’s comment on Zack’s blog because it sums up perfectly what I wanted to say:
“I think you wanted controversy when you decided to not include a comment from Zack because any good journalist knows in order to write a good piece you must always look at both side of the story and that is why you should mark this as an editorial piece.”
I hope they’re teaching you that in journalism school these days. It’s important. Maybe you weren’t listening after all?
Come on, it was a sports column on the back page of the paper. Totally meant as an editorial. Should Joey have gotten a comment from Zack? Maybe (I think so), but the fact that he didn’t certainly doesn’t mean it’s bad journalism. It’s not a news story, it’s an opinion and he’s entitled to it. I don’t understand the personal attacks on a student journalist. If you have a problem with what he said, have at it! But leave him as a person and a writer out of it.
As I sit here reflecting on my experiences with the Trojan family, I can’t help but think about how this article more than anything Arrogant Nation ever wrote reflects poorly on the USC community. I was introduced to USC during the 1990’s when 30,000 was the top attendance number, and as we suffered year after year of crushing defeat at the hands of bRuin nation, we were often outnumbered 2:1 in our own house. We had P**l Ha***t as a coach, and “The Mausoleum” as the nickname for our stadium. Oh, how I wish we had someone like Zack Jerome at that time.
I transferred to USC via community college, paid for school with loans and scholarship and joined the single most arrogant organization on campus..the Trojan Marching Band. The first thing we were taught (besides how to put Tribute To Troy and Conquest on repeat) was that we were the University of Southern California, win or lose.
 Zack Jerome didn’t invent #FTFO..the TMB did, and they did it at a time when they were recording Gold Records with Fleetwood Mac. Zack Jerome just reminded us that even under that darkest of skies, we are still an Arrogant Nation and that we’ll never go back to those days of a half empty Coliseum, and that win or lose we are SC. Zack’s time hasn’t passed, it’s just getting started and it won’t end until we raise #7 in the Coliseum and add our 12th National Championship, all the while dropping the mic and peacing out leaving the NCAA and SEC and ESPN hacks of the world slack jawed and wondering what the hell just happened. 
One last thing…
It’s a satire blog…chill out dude and just enjoy.
“arrogance, more or less, has become the unwritten manifesto for the student body” …actually it’s a written manifesto, and we’re all about it. #FTFO
This article is obviously written by someone whose mom’s message to ignore people who throw insults at him fell on deaf ears.  Here is what she was trying to tell you, in a nutshell:  Who cares what other people think about USC?  As long as people associated with the school make ethical choices and don’t embarass the institution, why is an alum who speaks his mind with tons of success a liability to any of us?  Ultimately, anyone who complains that we are arrogant and spoiled and whatever else is saying less about us at USC than they are about themselves:  They are insecure in the choices THEY have made and in what THEY have going on in their lives.  I won’t go so far as to say anyone doing that is “jealous,” and maybe it’s me buying into the very arrogance about which you write, but I personally find it hilarious and satisfying when someone talks about how pompous or spoiled we are.  At the end of the day, who gives a crap what they think.
Pump the breaks kiddo… Zack is one of the most entertaining and creative bloggers in sports today. He’s not for everyone but he certainly has become for me and many of his fans, in some ways, as much a part of this very special Sanctions Era team as MB7, TMac7 and everyone who decided to come back in order to handle “unfinished business”. The spirit of the Trojan Family is woven throughout his writing and in the exceptional way he lives his life. My 80 year old father, graduated undergrad and medical school from USC in the 50’s and is still a professor in the Medical School emailed me after reading the Arrogant Post Game Recap: Hawaii edition –  “I must be going thru a metamorphosis, or I’ve got a virus. I liked it….DAD”. Not exactly a glowing endorsement but I bet Zack will take it! #FTFO
FTFO
I agree with the previous 70 people. This article was written, poorly mind you, to garner attention for a subpar student ‘journalist’. Arrogant Nation is the rallying point for an entire student body.Iif you cannot understand the tongue in cheek foolery of the blog, then why not spend your time writing about topics you can grasp and comprehend?
I did not realize TJ Simers came in for a lecture.  Was the topic just shock journalism or was there also an innuendo message as well? Well you got your wish, a tone of responses but at the cost of a bit of integrety. 
FTFO (and no, Lost Angeles wasn’t the first coin that)
It’s sad that you you are hurting your own school. Why did you write this article? If you wanted attention you got it.  
Do not express these opinions in a newspaper supporting the school. Do it on your blog.
The only question is ” Why did you write this?”
My friends at UCLA love this article.
“My friends at UCLA love this article.”
That’s gonna leave a mark…
Thanks for writing this Joey, I’m totally on your side. I made some stupid meme on reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/z3c1k/sorry_but_i_think_the_arrogance_gimmick_is_old/) with the same ideas. Maybe you even saw it? Who knows. I got a decent amount of hate for it but not nearly what you’re getting. The internet is a terrible place.
In the end, I appreciate what Zack Jerome did to rebuild the morale of the school during the sanction era, but I just don’t think it’s cool to be a dick. Sorry I’m not sorry. Further comments/explanations given in the link above.
“sorry I’m not sorry” – that sounds like the comment of someone who is a dick…..but i thought you didn’t think it was cool to be a dick?!
thanks for the link though….we’ll be sure you get a lot more shit talking on your reddit post, after all, you were probably just seeking attention anyway, like this joey character
jealousy is destructive.
and sorry bro/bra, but 169 views in 2 weeks doesn’t exactly count as the establishment of a ‘meme’
You’re a chemical engineer…..leave the social things to the social people. If you want to find someone who knows about creating meme’s or creating something relevant on the internet, well just look to where you posted your silly attempt about a meme….on another silly piece of writing….that is trying to attack someone who spawned a viral movement.
cure cancer or some shit bro/bra – we got this
How could you, in the USC student newspaper, reprint this quote, “UCLA is the nice school and USC is located in a sh-t dump and populated exclusively by dumb rich kids,” and not rebut with anything stronger than “Unfair? A bit, yes.” Come on man…I don’t want to read that on an SC site. Just graduated and all of my friends anxiously look forward to Lost Angeles’ AGP and AGR every week. Zac Jerome enthusiastically rallies the student body and alumni base with written word, which is what the Daily Trojan should aspire to do as well.
Joey Joey Joey.  This really backfired on you, didn’t it.  Not only did you just make a fool out of yourself to every Trojan that picked up a copy of today’s picture, but you now are going to have 100s of comments explaining why you are simply wrong.  USC is like the Yankees.  We are the best at everything, which is why everybody hates us.  I, like a lot of my fellow Trojans, love that people hate us because it proves that we are better than them.  Wake up, get in touch with that this student body really feels, and save the PC articles for a school like Cal.
Joey, asking the Arrogant Nation to cease and desist is akin to asking all trojan fans to stop rooting for their team. All college sports have their fanatics, disciples and demigods and the Bearfighter just happens to embody all of those in one simple design we have come to know as Zack. 
He is fueled by the inequities of the NCAA sanctions and the tyranny of the PAC12 commissioner.  He consolidates all that is the Trojan Spirit and focuses it on a weekly basis towards our opponents.  He has filled a void that has always been there, he just put a name on it, made a website and made some extra cash on the side. That to me is the true embodiment of the Trojan Spirit. His passion for our beloved Trojans made it possible, along with some bourbon, to keep his head high in the face of adversity.
I think you wanted controversy when you decided to not include a comment from Zack because any good journalist knows in order to write a good piece you must always look at both side of the story and that is why you should mark this as an editorial piece.
Fight On!
joey, you have run your course. and you call zack, Mr. Jerome from now on.
Amidst all the comments hating on this article; I’ve got to say I agree with Joey.
I love being the best, I believe we are the best and always will be, and I think pride in being the best is great, but that’s not what he’s arguing against.
What he’s arguing against is, like he elegantly said,  flicking off the other teams in our arrogant, “everyone else is worthless” attitude. That works for an underdog team, but when you’re actually the best, and most people recognize it, the classy route is to let everybody else (the reporters, the teams we roll over) sing your praises, not shout them annoyingly in the face of others.
We’ve got something good here. No need to be jerks about having something good.
So it’s only okay to be publicly proud of your alma mater when we have a “down” year?
You clearly don’t know the difference between being Arrogant and being a douche.  Arrogant Nation isn’t about being a dick, it’s about being proud that we’re always going to be better, smarter, more successful and more beautiful than everyone else.
FTFO
There’s nothing wrong with letting others know we have something good here.  That is how you attract talent.  Mr. Jerome does this in a satirical way that even makes our opponents laugh. It’s “arrogantly” over the top and a great source for a bit of comic relief through the week.
I want to add to the sentiment that USC’s arrogance is nothing new. In 1941 UCLA was given a stupid bell from their alumni association. They started ringing it at football games. The Trojan Knights, feeling it was their duty to arrogantly F with the Bruins (as is any Trojan’s duty), they impersonated UCLA rooters, infiltrated the committee responsible for the well-being of the bell and stole it after it was loaded onto a truck headed for Westwood while the actual UCLA rooters searched for a replacement key to the truck. We hid this bell for an entire year (in a haystack for a period of time) and finally, a year later, we allowed UCLA to sign an agreement that would make the bell a trophy for which ever team won the football game that year. It wasn’t even ours to begin with and we made it so that UCLA had to beat us in order to even get it back. If that’s not arrogant, I don’t know what is. And that was 1941. FTFO!
Awesome
I think someone needs attention. Why would you write an article to attack a blog  who is supporting USC and that people like.  When USC got the sanctions and was suffering no one in the media supported USC. Arrogant Nation helped USC and showed how fans felt. Zack Jerome is a great person who does the blog in his free time. Fight On!
Hey Joey, You should transfer to UCLA…you belong there
along with jim-bo right below…
Mr. Kaufman — I couldn’t agree with you more.  Mr. Jerome’s relentless and senseless attacks on bears around the world in the face of their continued “threatened” status on the endangered species list borders on hate-crime status.  His implication that somehow all oranges are pedophiles is truly disgusting.  AND, just last week, he posted completely baseless allegations about Oregon’s Puddles’ drug use.
Zack Jerome must be stopped.  
#justincaseyoumisseditthisissatirejustlikezacksblog
Best comment yet! FTFO
#justincaseyoumisseditthisissatirejustlikezacksblog is now trending on twitter…
I think I love you
HAHAHAHAHA
Fail
Also, this might be the first time anyone’s cited a Gawker writer a support in a serious piece. But it makes sense that if Gawker’s (lack of) seriousness was misinterpreted, so would Zack’s.
I only wish we had the arrogant nation during the Larry Smith era. I think Mr. Kaufman has lost his sense of humor.
Come now, Smith wasn’t as bad as Hackett.
You’re worried about USC’s arrogant, spoiled, rich-kid image… so you call out a simultaneously eloquent/hilarious blogger who had the selflessness to apply those writing abilities toward dulling the pain of sanctions for an entire community? 
Hm.
Its been Fight the F-ck On! since before you were born.
I’m an alum from 1987, and also a sportswriter, turned financial editor, turned Sr. Copywriter for a Fortune 500 company. Everything I have made of my career I can attribute to USC.  From the internships that got me started, to the networking that got me every job thereafter. USC on my resume gets me in the door every time. I’m extremely proud to be part of this arrogant nation, along with the rest of my family and extended family. We’ve converted Razorbacks, Beavers and even Bruins to our Trojan family with just one tailgate. SC is displayed all over my work, my car and my home, and if haters call us cheaters, I make sure they know just how arrogant we are. We have the greatest school, marching band, mascot, athletics department and alum in the world, and we should be arrogant! Once a Trojan, always a Trojan. We are arrogant and proud, and I hope the many generations of Trojans to come feel the same way.
Why on earth do we care about what anyone thinks?
Completely agree with every other comment and completely disagree with Joey Kaufman. Don’t even think this was really necessary.
Joey, you have made an ass of yourself. Here is Zack’s reply to your piece:
http://lostangelesblog.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/daily-trojan-thinks-its-time-for-me-to-go/
Judging from the comments on the Daily Trojan, you have seriously mistimed your post, no one here seems ready to say goodbye to the Arrogant Nation. I for one am an avid reader of his blog and love how he owns and reworks the stereotypes about ‘SC. He loves this school and is so devoted that he doesn’t even want his fans to beat you up about this ill-advised article. Good luck in your career and next time, think twice before you write and submit a piece like this. #FTFO
Is this guy related to Scott Wolf…?
awesome!!
win
Dude, get a clue.  We REVEL in our arrogance.  We LOVE IT.  Have you even been to a football game or watched a band practice?  Have you ever spoken to the alumni?  Have you???  
It’s who we are, and we do NOT apologize for it!  Do you know why we sing “UCLA Sucks” when the band plays Tusk, regardless of the opponent on the field?  (I mean, besides the fact that UCLA does, in fact, suck)… it’s because today’s opponent is insignificant.  They are an ant, and we considered them crushed before kickoff.  And it is part of reminding today’s opponent that we aren’t worried about them, we’re not even thinking about them.  Buh-bye.  
It is not lost on the fans that whoever we’re playing that week, it’s one of that team’s biggest games of the season.  EVERY WEEK.  Why?  Because we’re THAT awesome.
If you want to embrace your inner Trojan, you need to accept your superiority, embrace it, and have fun with it just as Zack Jerome does.  It’s okay for other schools to think we’re arrogant.  We are.  (SC!)  But we’re also THAT GOOD.  We’re up to our arrogance.  Arrogance is the backbone of the Trojan family, and what makes our bond so strong… it’s our shared belief in the superiority of our fellow Trojans.  Not just “oh, you went to the same school as me and I feel nostalgic”.  It’s much stronger than that.
What you suggest in your article, that arrogance had its place when we were struggling under sanctions but now that we’re not, things have somehow changed smells very reminiscent of the stench of fair weather fandom.  The Arrogant Nation always believed in the superiority of Trojans, whereas your faith wavered. And now that we’re back in our rightful place on top, you want to kick to the curb those who hung by and believed in the Spirit of Troy when you didn’t?  I don’t think so, bub.
You need to spend more Saturdays on the ground with the die-hards and figure out what we’re really about.  And if you don’t like what you find… well, I’m sure there’s some hippy-dippy school up north that would welcome you.  To the rest of us: FTFO
Cindy – nailed it.  FTFO!
Joey, Joey, Joey. We became Arrogant in the 20s when Coach Howard Jones when we won our first FOUR national championships. I’d like to think The Thundering Herd was our first Arrogant Nation and Zack took it to the next level during our greatest time of need. 
And sanctions or not, I will always root against our rivals, trash talk on gameday and shake hands at the end of the day. My friends know I’m arrogant. They still love me.
You clearly have no idea what being a USC Trojan is all about and do not deserve to be included in the Arrogant Nation.  I am saddened by your message and your lack of school pride.
I feel as though “Arrogant Nation” is something that we have come to embrace for good reason. It’s been an ongoing dialogue between other schools and USC: “You guys are rich.” “No we’re not!” You guys think you’re better than everyone else.” No we don’t!” “You guys are so spoiled!” “No we’re not!” “You guys are arrogant….” And finally, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em and embrace it. Our final response to all this trash talk…
“FINE! You’re right…We are arrogant. For good reason. Our school has more prestige, pride and power than your school could ever dream of. A tradition unlike any other. We’ll kick your ass in the business world and we’ll kick your ass on the football field too. We are a tight-knit family of elite students and alumni and we are damn proud of that fact. We are the Trojan Family. It’s us against the world and we are ARROGANT.”
I don’t think that the article is getting at what everybody seems to be implying. I think the point isn’t that there isn’t a place for a certain level of arrogance, pride, or, more importantly, the lostangeles blog as a whole. The premise of the article has a certain inherent level of arrogance; that we don’t need the outward arrogance nearly as much because our team speaks for itself. I think he’s calling more for a slight message shift, or at least a more mature message. And I don’t think that’s bad. There are certain aspects of the ‘arrogance’ that have run their course. I love and have loved the blog. And Joey even says he embraced the message in it. I think you guys are being a little hard on a guy who clearly just wants the best for the student body and USC as a whole, and, in my opinion, is not insinuating that the blog should go. USC is clearly about more than arrogance, and I think we should embrace all of it.
“The premise of the article has a certain inherent level of arrogance; that we don’t need the outward arrogance nearly as much because our team speaks for itself”
– dude, wait, I’m confused. First off, the team speaks for itself every Saturday. Don’t you get that this is about the fans? Arrogant Nation speaks for us.
the premise of this article is the furthest thing from arrogant….singing Kumbaya with your (figurative) enemies and telling them how equal we all are sounds a lot like being a pushover and a kiss-ass. Throwing one of the strongest voices of your family under the bus sounds like betrayal. This isn’t cricket or high Tea time….there is no place for PC civil gallantry in football or life, well if you want to be successful anyway.
No one ever saved the world by being nice – they did it by saying “F* you , my ideas are better, I believe in myself, Scoreboard”
it’s only immature if you’re not living up to the (justifiably) arrogant picture you project
You
and plenty of Nice things were done for the world by people being ambitious, fearless, outside-the-box, unapologetically confident, dedicated and loyal
At the beginning I was just saying that acting like we’ve been there before is a quiet, and, I would argue, more powerful sort of arrogance. Comparing it to saving the world is straw man argument at best.a 
I get that you don’t like his opinion. I differ in opinion as well to an extent. But I think it’s silly to say the guy has  negative intentions. He sees things differently. He wants the best for the university. There is room for both Joeys and Zacks in the world. I know what everyone is insinuating from Joey’s article, and I know you think he was just throwing Zack under the bus, but I just don’t think it really is about Zack or AN, as much as it’s about knowing that there will always be an arrogance, genuine or otherwise, but that the USC fan base doesn’t necessarily need to define itself as arrogant. 
I, personally, like the qualities of a Trojan set out by the university. You can put arrogance under faithful if you like. But I prefer the original set of characteristics to define us.
As much as it doesn’t flow as well, I’d prefer a Faithful, Scholarly, Skillful, Courageous, and Ambitious (FSSCA) Nation. And I think we can agree that arrogant doesn’t embody all of those things. And I don’t know if the fan base has shown that we embody all of these things as of late. That’s not to say there isn’t room for arrogance. I think it’s inherent in college sports to some degree. Especially USC sports. But we can do better.
Clearly, a lot of people have already said this, but lighten up. Sports, particularly football, brings out arrogance in EVERYONE. While there are people who take it too far, do you really think we’re actually booing the boys on the opposing team when they run out of the Colisieum? No. We’re booing them because they’re competition. 
And if you read his blogs, Jerome gives credit where credit is due. I mean, for God sakes, the man calls himself “The Bearfighter” and he recognized that UCLA had a nice big win against Nebraska on Saturday. 
Arrogant Nation is a little more tongue and cheek than you are painting it. Oh, and by the way, you might as well accept the fact that USC fans are some of the most arrogant football fans in the nation. And that arrogance comes from excellence, not from wealth.
kind of hard to add on to Jessy’s point….it’s pretty simple – read between the lines. The Bearfighter was my freshman roommate in Fluor tower, Fall 2001 – so trust me when I tell you, you got it all wrong.
I’m pretty sure I never saw him wear an Ed Hardy T-shirt or a pink Ralph Lauren Polo with the collars flipped up to his Gucci frames; I never saw him burn the tires of his banged-out hand-me down Mercury on Westwood Blvd; and I never saw him come with anything but sharp wit and class to any man, woman, child, stranger or enemy (not literal enemy, like figuratively, like as in we’re having fun with football – he has no literal enemies, other than bears) .
He’s a gentleman and a scholar – and I could not be more proud of the collective voice he has championed. Kids these days are too entitled. We EVEN had a wet Coliseum in our early day, and  our fans were kind of pathetic. Our early dorm room banter was about being a killer fan no matter what. We owned campus, Trousdale, Rose Garden, Coliseum, 9-0, Row every single Saturday….before we were crazy super good. We truly believed that our die hard fanaticism would turn around a program and deprogram that concept of a fair weather fan. Mission Accomplished, ZJ
We have progressed past a “fair-weather” fan base and have garnered a powerful year round proud and passionate fan base. You couldn’t ask for more as a University or a sports program. The players love it. The coaches love it. The fans love it. The media recycles Arrogant Nation content. 
We have something unique – thinking outside the box, bucking the system – that’s where the greatest innovation and progress comes. 
Come over to our side, we’ll accept you too – and show you the true nuance of being classily arrogant.
Is this guy really a Trojan?  All arguments aside, he says “it’s ranked in the top five of virtually every top-25 poll imaginable.”
Seriously man, where is your pride?  The published rankings clearly show USC being AT LEAST third in every PUBLISHED poll (http://espn.go.com/college-football/rankings).
Not sure where you are sourcing your material that says USC ranks 5th?  Are you being paid by those dirty bears across town to disparage your own?
I have been a Trojan for over 3 decades–through amazing seasons and horrible ones, and I thank Zack for putting the time and effort and love into supporting ‘SC and our football team, our student body and our fan base during the last couple of years of absolute BS.  He didn’t create Arrogant Nation, but he definitely put a name to it, with his wit and tongue-in-cheek posts.  If we are to be punished for what we “should have known”, then we can scorn the ncaa and everybody that gleefully branded us “cheaters” and remain proud of our school and team and tradition.  If you don’t understand that and actually believe that we should censor his free speech, then maybe you shouldn’t be writing for the DT.  
Until we are completely out of the sanctions, I refuse to say anything other than FTFO.  If Zack retires his keyboard at the end of this season as he has indicated may be a possibility, then that should be his decision.  Until then, he has my support and gratitude for the laughs and being a beacon for some of the less die-hards.  And if I run into him at a tailgate, I hope to have a fine scotch to offer as well.
FTFO!
Drew, perfectly stated! Hope you and the fam are doing well.
As a 10+ year alumnus, and season ticket holder, and a person whose blood runs cardinal and gold, there has been (and continues to be) nothing better for Trojan Nation than Zack and Lost Angeles. I think your literal definition of arrogance is very different than what Zack means by Arrogant in his posts. As someone above said, he embodies that first virtue carved on Tommy’s base: FAITHFUL. He has made us laugh, he has been brutally honest about our performances on the field, and he has opened up his life to all of the Trojan Family. And since it’s a personal blog, your opinion is your own – it’s up to Zack whether to continue or not. And personally, though he’s said this is the last year, I hope it continues in perpetuity. If you don’t like it Joey, then don’t read it. Sorry if that comes across as harsh. But it’s the truth. Fight On! Beat the Farm!
I find it funny when people refer to USC has the university of spoiled children.  That we’re rich and oozing with money.
Like that’s supposed to make me feel bad about myself?  hahahahaha   Those guys are too dumb to realize they’re saying I’m better off than them.  Wooo!  Morons.
#FTFO
There is nothing to hate about being ambitious and having a better reputation because of it.    Obviously Zack’s blog is to be taken with a grain of salt, but in many ways the ‘arrogance’ that he has portrayed, in the bad times, and now the good, has in my eyes given Trojans even more ambition to keep up the ‘arrogance’ and continue to make our school one of the top, most sought after, universities in the nation.  And make no mistake, this arrogance is completely justified, it wouldn’t work if SC wasn’t better than ever…
Conversation I had with a UCLA student at a bar that made me even prouder(more justifiably arrogant) to be a Trojan:
Bruin: “You went to USC, ugh, they suck.”
Me: “USC is a better school than UCLA right now.”
Bruin: “Yea, but that’s only because you guys have more money, better sports, and better research and academics.”
Me: “Exactly.” 
To be arrogant is one thing, to have it justified by your rival is another(albeit one case personally, but I am sure there are many other cases).  Zack has embraced our justified arrogance and it makes all of us prouder to be a part of something so successful.  I would much rather read Zacks’ blog then read a blog that tells me to not celebrate my alma matter being successful in sports, academics, raising money, being attractive, life, etc…if the time comes that Trojans aren’t justified to say these things, then I would have a problem with it, but why not embrace it now.  No one’s going to question the arrogance.
Whoa, whoa, whoa – Hold the phone! Is this Article laying out how the force that brought so many together to cheer on our Trojans should now be discarded, based only on the fact that we are now looking better and able to play for the NC?  Should we mothball the navy seals now that Bin Laden has been smoked?  Then what; Then who takes the fight to the streets when the Media, haters and bRuins start to run their mouths?  The Arrogant Nation brought fans, alumnus and current students together in a time of need, and in doing so gave the Team something to play for besides ridicule and the snarky remarks from everyone outside our circle of Awesome!  LONG LIVE THE BEARFIGHTER!!!
PS. I only ordered one pair of shades, but got two! That was super Arrogant of you.
There’s so much wrong with this article..
First off, thank you Jonathan K for pointing out my first issue-  
“During the bowl ban years, arrogance didn’t exactly move the needle much as USC mostly puttered around outside the top 25. It was a way to hang on.” USC finished ranked 6th & would have arguably challenged for a National Title if given an opportunity so “puttered around outside the top 25 might be slightly off. 
My second issue-
“Arrogance is flashing your middle finger at someone wearing opposing colors.”
no thats being a d bag, i’m flabbergasted you don’t comprehend the difference.
Jessy said it best “if you get offended by the humor than dont read it” & its damn good humor btw, Zach Jerome is a living legend to me & he has stood up & fought for us in a time when no one wanted to so he is damn sure deserving as are all of us long time Trojan fans of throwing on our bear skin coats over our Bowls are for salad t shirts & having a little fun during an extremely fun time for this program.. Quit being the old cranky neighbor who’s whining for us to turn down the music Joey, be the neighbor that comes over & while he might not fully agree with our party, he knows we deserve this party. Ill pour you a drink & get you a blonde. 
Id also look to point out the best part of this entire article/comments was Kyle Wheeler calling Zach “Jack” in his comment. There is nothing more arrogant to me than messing up someones name. I Love it
FTFO
They are always going to call us the University of Spoiled Children and make those BS comments.  It’s sad that they need to put us down to feel better about themselves, but it’s not going to go away no matter what Zack says or doesn’t say in his blog.
I have no problem with the blog or its message of arrogance, I just wish that Zach Jerome would proofread his posts before publishing them. The spelling errors are embarrassing for a blog that serves as such an influential representative of the USC fanbase.
I think this article is what we dont need….
Lost Angeles got us through the sanctions and we all became fans of Zack and his writing.
If you dont like what he has to say, dont read it. What is the need to write an article like this stating that he (or the arrogant nation) is no longer needed?
By the way, our boys didnt just “putter around the outside of the top 25” last year….you may need a fact checker on that one…..
2 things: 1) Zack Jerome just drinks scotch and hunts bears so I’m sure he doesn’t care that you think about the Arrogant Nation. 2) Zack Jerome writes about Kyle Negrete’s cyborg leg so I think it’s a little bit ridiculous that you take him so seriously. His blog is supposed to be entertaining and a great way for alums and students to rally together. Take a chill pill, Joey.
I see where you’re coming from, but frankly, I think you’re way off base. Save the squeaky-clean perception for Pat Haden and the administration; it’s working for them. But when it comes to the fanbase, arrogance is what we do best. We’re the fans that crudely trash our rival in one of our most famous band songs. We’re the fans who jingle the keys to our expensive cars as we close out a win. We’re the fans that made it so the marching band can never play that Gary Glitter song ever again. And I like it that way. It’s who we are. It’s what USC football is. Ours is a tradition of arrogance. We stab the field as part of our pregame ceremony, effectively claiming victory before the game is even played. It doesn’t get much more arrogant than that.
Save the classiness for the classroom. Yes, USC is growing in stature as an academic institution. Nikias wants to make USC an Ivy League of the West Coast, and I’m all for that. That doesn’t mean that, as fans of the greatest football team on the West Coast, we need to change who we are to cater to national perception. Who cares if the rest of college football hates us? They should; we’re more attractive, earn more valuable degrees, and still dominate on the football field. Zack Jerome didn’t create some temporary fix for a dark time; he helped remind us who we’ve been all along. We’re SC, we’re arrogant, we’re winners, no matter what some arbitrary governing body says. And that’s the way it should be.
It’s a satirical sports blog… And last time I checked we are still sanctioned so I’m pretty sure his site is still fair game as far as your set of rules go.
I can’t help but feel this is a recommendation that everyone should be a fair weather fan. Well I for one, refuse to do just that. Through thick and thin, there are many fans (including myself) who have stood by our team and rooted them on, but when the sanctions dropped, so many lost hope, and we all were divided, left feeling like we were the only ones still cheering. Arrogant Nation helped to encourage even the shakiest of fans in the darkest of hours to not lose hope, to stand up and cheer for the team that we love. 
I give Zack at least partial credit for some of the players still being here this season- he and his blog helped to re-establish a support group of fans that no other university (outside of maybe Texas or the SEC) has seen the likes of in times of trouble. Even at the lowest of low, even when we couldn’t win a bowl, there was still glory in playing Trojan football. New recruits saw it! Despite the fact they couldn’t get scholarship money, they still signed up. So if you’re suggesting that we should sit back and politely golf clap instead of enjoying the spoils of victory (LIKE ANY OTHER COLLEGE FOOTBALL FAN IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD, ESPECIALLY AFTER GOING THROUGH THIS), then no, I will not “chill out, bro.” 
Self righteous fans do not belong in college football. Years before the bearfighter ever came along, there were FUCLA shirts and teddy bears drug across the quad with rope. We battle-cried and set sh!t on fire, and it was awesome. How is this in any worse taste? If anything, he’s truthfully illuminating the pomp, circumstance, and insanity that is college football under a hilarious microscope, and uniting the Trojan Family instead of suggesting a division of it (like you, sir, are currently doing.) 
I love Arrogant Nation and everything that it stands for, because it was there when we needed it most. You don’t turn your back on someone who’s helped you through the rough patches, do you? 
Besides, USC will always have the stigma of being USC. If we’re gonna have a label slapped on us, we might as well represent. #FTFO
word
#FTFO, Veronica!
Read this Joey, maybe you will wake up.
Transfer, you obviously aren’t proud of being a trojan.
You shouldn’t need a gimmick website to stay together as fans. What you describe are fairweather fans.
Am I arrogant regarding where I go to school?  Hell yes.  I go to the best school in the universe and it is better than any college anywhere.  I think that every Trojan is the best because we are taught by the best, and are surrounded by the best.  Our arrogance, especially that of Arrogant Nation, is beautiful because it is smiling at the people who try and bring us down.  Sure, it is going to piss people off that are not in the Trojan Family, but it is a beautiful way of not letting ANYONE bring us down.  It’s like when someone honks loud at you on the freeway for no reason and you give them a thumbs up.  It’s giving them the middle finger WITHOUT doing it.
And for the record, my father is a Bruin, but reads the blog and absolutely loves it.
As someone who graduated last year and went all 4 years with Zach’s posts I feel like you could not be more out of touch.  Don’t take yourself/ or Zach’s posts so seriously.  The purpose of Arrogant Nation isn’t to paint a picture of USC to outsiders.  It is something that brought levity to a grim situation, kept SC “pride” intact, and maybe in some small part helped us be where we are right now.  For someone who works 12 hours a day I look forward to the 2 hours a week when I can read his previews and recaps.  
Zach himself said that this is most likely his last arrogant season, he feels like he should finish what he started and I agree.  It would really be a shame if one article from one DT writer without any perspective ruined something so great for so many Trojans, both undergraduate and alumni.
Hate to break it to you, but this is only Zach’s third year writing the blog. He didn’t start writing about USC until the sanctions started.
Zacks blog is a characterization of the first value of a Trojan, faithful.
…and lets be honest, FTFO was in place long before Jerome. So read his blog, have a good laugh, and get over yourself.
The Bear Fighter is a genius and a wonderful writer. Obviously his tongue-in-cheek irony is lost on some, but that isn’t what really “irks” me about your column Mr. Kaufman. You seem to be arguing that Zack Jerome had his place when we were under the oppression of the sanctions, when we couldn’t win a “fake national championship.” Now that things are “serious” and we have the ability to be champions again he’s supposed to be cast aside? We’re supposed to forget that those silly little sanctions ever happened and go back to playing “real” football? Jerome kept Trojan pride alive. He reminded us that no matter what, at the end of the day we’re still Trojans, trophy or not. 
You sir, are un-ironically “arrogant” for thinking that the opinion of your sad little column could possibly discourage a fan base who was rallied by a true Trojan, a fighter, like Jerome. I for one will continue to stand with my Trojan Family in the Arrogant Nation. #ftfo
Seriously bro? You should open your eyes and grow up..
Perhaps if the arrogant blog were not entirely based on satire your points would hold more weight, but the reality is that the writing style is obviously comedic and I have yet to hear a single person say that I have degrees from the “University of Spoiled Children” on the basis of Zach Jerome’s stellar website. What you propose is to cut what is an obvious trilogy short because of your fear of perception. This is USC and we don’t stop the telling an epic tale because we’re afraid some bRuin or Kal kid is going to call us all arrogant because of a blog. Are you serious? What’s courageous or scholarly about that?
I enjoy the rants of the arrogant nation, not because I consider myself part of this clique, but rather for entertainment purposes.  I think AN has a place among the Trojan Family and the guy should be allowed to continue his blog.  You might feel differently, which is a choice.  How USC chooses to acknowledge Jerome is up to the University, but your article walks a fine line calling for censorship on the basis of public perception.  That’s lame.  With that said, you bring up great points on the values of what it really means to be a Trojan.  Arrogance is an exaggerated sense of one’s abilities, exaggerated being the key word.
Really Joey?  You have apparently missed out on the whole point.  The best way to answer the “snobby rich kid” stereotype you seem to fear is to embrace it and make it our own.  Poke fun at it, play it up.  Getting indignant about it is exactly the reaction the SC haters are trying to provoke.   There is no shame in being better looking, smarter, faster and richer!     Who wouldn’t want that?  You’d rather be ugly, dumb, slow and poor?   FTFO Zack and stay arrogant buddy!
I would say we need Zack and his blog now more than ever. Because IF there is even one tiny misstep by this team, the blogosphere, local and national media will try and knock us off the front page AND drop Matt out of the Heisman race as quickly as you can say East Coast Bias.  I appreciate your respect for the “Trojan Family”, but your proposal to separate us is frankly the antithesis of what a family is.
“your proposal to separate us is frankly the antithesis of what a family is.”
Nailed it.
so true! they media is ready to pounce, already planning our demise this season.
Tell me you’ve never screamed “UCLA SUCKS!” at a football game when the TMB plays “Tusk” and your article will carry a little more weight with me. Trash-talk and exaggeration are a standard of competitive sports at all levels; a way to get fans and players excited, a way to distinguish “us” and “them”. That divide of our team versus your team is at the very heart of competition and lets be real: no one wants to go to a pep rally and listen to how nice or accomplished the other team is.
Lost Angeles is a blog that lives in that pump-up mentality. As you mentioned, that tone was particularly important while we were under sanctions, but now that we’re bowl-eligible it shouldn’t just be chucked out the window. Fans want to be excited about their team and their sport, and Zach Jerome gets USC fans excited. Is he over the top? Absolutely. But if he met Andrew Luck at a party, I highly doubt their conversation would sound anything like the Stanford posts on his blog.
Instead of focusing on USC’s arrogance (an arrogance present in every sports culture) maybe you should look to the loyalty and pride that underlays it. Because that’s what Zach’s blog, and being a Trojan, is all about.
As a recent graduate of USC who isn’t one of the rich kids, I understand you wanting to beat the stereotype. Being a Trojan has enabled me to earn prestigious fellowships, scholarships, awards and jobs. But, what your argument fails to address, is the other perceptions people have of USC, besides the rich dumb kids. 
For the past two years, at every internship I’ve had across the country, I’ve been called a cheater. I’ve been told that the only reason my school was every any good AT ANYTHING was because we cheated. Do I think I or anyone else at USC cheated? No. Do I think Reggie Bush is in the wrong. No, not really. If you’re coming from a bad background, it’s hard to wait three years to make big bucks when your family is living in a harsh neighborhood or can’t afford basic amenities. Or the fact that you can’t afford a nice suit on an NCAA athlete stipend. 
Now that our two year bowl ban is up, I think the blog has an even large responsibility and roll. It’s to remind the new Trojans, entering into the family, WHY they need to be so proud (and even arrogant) about their team and their school. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of this season or the potential awards that our players may get. But the blog is there to remind us that EVERYONE out there hates us. I’ve personally witnessed this in several cities across the US while wearing school shirts. We’ve never done anything wrong, but they do across the country. Because of this, we must cheer that much harder, support our team that much more, and yes, be arrogant and proud, win or lose. 
There’s always room for a blog like Lost Angeles. The day it isn’t needed is the day views drop below 1000+ daily.
Zack Jerome has most definitely not run it’s course.  He says what all of us think but are too PC to actually say.  Why should we feel bad about having a good football team, a top ranked academic institution, perfect weather and beautiful students and alumni?  Why should we feel bad for celebrating our success?
As students and alumni of the University of Southern California, we should be proud of our past and continued success.  If that makes me ARROGANT, then I am more than willing to take up that mantle.  I’m not going to feel bad that my football team is better than yours, that my school is better than yours, that my fellow alumni are more successful than you and that the other students at my university are better looking than you.  
If there’s one place where I don’t need to be PC, it’s in my unbridled support for my alma mater.
Fight On!
Yeah, it’s called irony, and having high spirits. It’s only week 3, at least let the vision come to fruition before kicking it to the curb just because you feel we don’t “need it anymore.” It’s now apart of the culture, and it showed the entire country how the Trojans conduct themselves in the face of such a disappointing last few years (and a disappointing BCS).
There’s a lot I take issue with here. First, there’s this: “During the bowl ban years, arrogance didn’t exactly move the needle much as USC mostly puttered around outside the top 25. It was a way to hang on.”
You do realize that last season was a bowl ban year too, right? And USC finished ranked 6th. I’m not saying the idea of arrogant nation made that happen, but it certainly helped keep some fans excited.
Then there’s this: “Arrogance is flashing your middle finger at someone wearing opposing colors.”
No, that is not arrogance. That is being a jerk. Arrogance is knowing that, win or lose, USC is always awesome.
Finally you say that “USC is above [arrogance].” That sounds pretty arrogant to me.
(And like others said, it’s mostly tongue-in-cheek anyway. The perception of USC being a bunch of dumb rich kids is never going to go away, so why shouldn’t we have some fun with it?)
“Then there’s this: ‘Arrogance is flashing your middle finger at someone wearing opposing colors.’ No, that is not arrogance. That is being a jerk. Arrogance is knowing that, win or lose, USC is always awesome.”
Knowing that USC is awesome win or lose is called pride, not arrogance. I believe that the Lost Angeles blog did serve its purpose over the course of the bowl ban, but that does not mean that it does not have a purpose to serve now. I just think that the purpose needs to be altered to fit the current state of the football team. Yes, we are playing with 10 less players than other programs, but there is no denying that we are no longer the underdog so the message of arrogance and fighting on to come out on top when the odds are against us is simply outdated. I think the blog should portray a message of Trojan pride, not arrogance. We can be proud of our school without being rude to others and perpetuating the negative stereotype that being a USC student sometimes holds.
10 *fewer* players than other programs. 
And while I’m correcting word choice, have you seen a thesaurus entry for “pride?”
Main Entry:	pride
Part of Speech:	verb
Definition:	take pleasure in accomplishment
Synonyms:	be proud, boast, brag, congratulate, crow, exult, felicitate, flatter oneself, gasconade, glory in, hold head high, overbear, pique*, plume, prance, preen, presume, puff up, revel in, strut, swagger, swell, vaunt
What part of that doesn’t sound arrogant?
We are ‘SC. We are arrogant. And we are proud to be Trojans. #FTFO.
Exactly right, Jonathan!  I almost copy/pasted your entire response to make it my own.  I gagged upon reading those very same points you address.
We didn’t start calling ourselves Arrogant, others did. When people try to insult you for being ambitious, you make them eat their envious nonsense, if you’re a real Trojan.
I have been around USC for over thirty years.  The student body and alumni are among the most talented, attractive, capable, and arrogant people on earth.  Zack Jerome did not make USC and Trojan Nation arrogant.  We`were that way since before you were born.  Keep calm, Fight On, and remember we are better, smarter, and faster than the rest.
I actually kind of agree with this article… I love the blog and I am thankful for how Zack kept our spirits high during the bowl bans, but we are no longer in need of this. The blog served its purpose.
While I see your point, I can’t help but feel this entire article was written to get you attention rather than out of true concern.  Maybe give people something better to read and something better to “follow” and they will. But until then you can’t complain about everyone liking and embracing the fun and humor associated with this guys blog. I hate myself for posting on this and giving it the attention that you were begging for by writing it.
THANK YOU. My thoughts exactly.
DT writer Joey Kaufman doesn’t get it. We understood and embraced arrogance when I was a freshman at SC in the 1970s. It’s the same now. The DT should thank Zack Jerome every day. And Joey should call him Mr. Jerome.
Get a grip of yourself, you sanctimonious child.
Yeah, what Jessy said.
I agree with Jessy. I am a Scion and a recent Trojan graduate, and Jack’s messages are what kept us bonded together during our hardest trials as fans.  For you to now turn and tell him  he is not needed or that his message is wrong, is just your perception.  To also then take it a step further and write an article seemingly against him is just wrong to me. We are the TROJAN FAMILY as you wrote…So chill out and take a step back.
if you really take “arrogant nation” LITERALLY, then it is you that has the problem. Its an exaggeration that mocks our sterotypes, just fun which is what college football is all about. Chill out and let this guy write his blog. If you get offended by the humor than dont read it.

Luckily for Kostas Genidounias, life gives out opportunities for redemption.
After taking the long road to USC from Greece and missing five weeks with a broken finger last season, life is pretty good now for the 6-foot-1 sophomore driver.
Firepower · Sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias was the Trojans’ third-leading scorer with 31 goals in 2011, despite missing five games after breaking his finger. This year, he has already tallied seven goals in four games. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC is favored to win its fifth consecutive NCAA men’s water polo title this season, and Genidounias is helping lead the way as one of the Trojans’ most potent offensive threats. Yet all of this once seemed like a distant dream for the Athens native.
Genidounias started playing water polo at age seven, and by 13, he was training with the Greek national team.
His parents, Sofaklis and Lilly, wanted him and his three siblings to attend school abroad, so he attended the American Community School of Athens starting in the eighth grade.
His rise to being one of Greece’s top amateur water polo prospects became Genidounias’s ticket to an American education. He had his sights set on USC.
“[Genidounias] called me out of the blue and said he wanted to be a Trojan,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said.
Unfortunately, Vavic was out of scholarships when recruiting Genidounias. During his senior year of high school, Genidounias waited for the phone call that never came. He emailed Vavic but received news that he wouldn’t be able to attend USC during the 2010-11 academic year.
Nonetheless, Genidounias remained steadfast in his desire to go to USC. So even when Loyola Marymount called and offered him a full ride, he turned it down.
He stayed in Greece and continued to play water polo for his club team and the Greek National Under-18 squad.
Then came his breakout performance at the European Youth Championships in Germany during August 2010. Though Greece lost 12-13 to Italy in the championship match, Genidounias was named the tournament’s MVP and vaulted himself onto the radar of Vavic and the nation’s other top college water polo coaches.
In October 2010, despite having no interactions since the previous spring, Genidounias contacted Vavic again.
In this case, the second time was the charm. Genidounias’ improvement combined with available scholarships meant that the USC dream would work out after all.
After high school graduation, Genidounias’ days consisted of playing water polo for his U-18 club team.
“It was nice,” Genidounias said. “Who doesn’t want to have some time off?” Genidounias said.
But his mood quickly changed.
“At some point it became boring … I’m glad I got to come here,” Genidounias said.
Genidounias’ success in the pool continued once he reached USC. Being a bit of an unknown commodity to opponents as an international player, Genidounias flew under the radar for five games.
In his sixth game as a true freshman, he scored five goals in a 10-8 victory over UCLA in the championship match of the NorCal Tournament in Stockton, Calif.
“When UCLA played us, they had no idea who he was,” said captain and senior two-meter Matt Burton. “The five goals changed that pretty quick.”
After that, Genidounias was not left open often. But, he still continued to have success thanks to his versatility.
“Kostas is one of the extremely rare players who’s an extremely good shooter and a great passer,” Vavic said.
Burton echoed these sentiments with a basketball analogy.
“Kostas is like a point guard and shooting guard rolled into one,” Burton said. “He has great vision, can make a play from nothing and is just too dangerous as a pass-first guy.”
Genidounias finished third on the team with 31 goals last season and is currently second through four games with seven goals.
What’s even more intimidating for opponents is Genidounias is now at full health.
His counting statistics at season’s end would have been much greater if he hadn’t missed five games after breaking his finger in a midseason match against California.
Water polo is a sport where using both hands is crucial for balance and strength in the water. With his broken finger, Genidounias’ left hand essentially became useless.
“I did nothing with my left hand for four to five weeks after the injury,” Genidounias said. “All I could do was swim with one hand and work on my legs.”
Though Genidounias wanted to return as soon as possible, he wasn’t in top shape when he returned just in time for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament and the NCAA Final Four that followed.
“In some ways, it was a good thing,” Vavic said about Genidounias’ injury. “Kostas needed a break from water polo after playing all year, during the summer and the season.”
Back from injury, 2012 is Kostas’ time to shine. Though Vavic and Genidounias agree his defense still needs work, his offensive abilities are already giving opponents fits.
“On offense, the sky is pretty much the limit [for him],” Burton said.
With Greece in ongoing economic turmoil, Genidounias has gained extra motivation and appreciation for the sport that helped bring him to Southern California.
“Everyone’s so jealous in a good way that I’m here, and I’m really doing something good for my future,” Genidounias said.

This Monday, David Guetta digitally re-released his fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat 2.0. And though the album debuts six new songs with some notable guest artists, it isn’t a significant improvement over the original release.
“She Wolf (Falling to Pieces),” featuring Sia, has already been released as the first single from the new album, although it has yet to crack the U.S. charts. It follows the typical progression of the Guetta-Sia songs  like “Titanium,” with an easy piano instrumental before crescendoing to a thumping chorus.
It takes over a third of the song to reach that chorus, though, and the electronic interlude seems all too short. In fact, Sia’s vocals dominate most of the track, crooning about the hunter and the hunted without moving much past the repeated lines in the chorus.
“She Wolf” fails to reach the same level of catchiness compared to “Titanium,” the current hit on seemingly every radio station. If the tempo were to pick up during the verses and more emphasis was put on Guetta’s mixing, the track might be a bigger hit in North America.
Ne-Yo and Akon provide perhaps the best chance for a big hit off the album, however, with “Play Hard.” Borrowing from “Better Off Alone” by Alice Deejay, the backing track is immediately recognizable — a good thing considering some of the catchiest Top-40 hits in recent history have sampled older hits, from Kanye West’s “Stronger” (Daft Punk) to Flo Rida’s “Right Round” (Dead or Alive).
Unlike some of the other tracks on the album, it is nearly impossible to resist dancing for the entire 3 1/2  minutes of “Play Hard.” Plus, the endless repeating of the “Work Hard, Play Hard” mantra is all too difficult to get out of one’s head.
“Wild Ones 2” serves as a sequel to the original “Wild Ones,” although Flo Rida is notably absent on this update. Sia does not bring anything new to the table, boldly repeating “Hey, I heard you were a wild one!” between lengthy dance sequences that are an improvement over the original. They are somewhat reminiscent of Guetta’s earlier work, recalling the hook in “Sexy B-tch” featuring Akon.
Another addition to the re-release, “Just One Last Time,” featuring newcomer Taped Rai, is strangely chilling and perhaps the most subdued song on the album. Granted, Guetta’s trademark work is present in the chorus, where the track departs from verses that almost lull listeners to sleep.
Taped Rai, a relatively unknown vocalist from Sweden, likely hopes that collaborating with a high-profile DJ will be a stepping-stone into launching his own individual career. “Just One Last Time” is his first released song.
At first, “In My Head” featuring NERVO sounds eerily similar to the songs featuring Sia. The track takes its time building up, gradually adding more instruments as the verses proceed. The gratifying drop that all fans patiently wait for finally comes after the first minute, and the song keeps its driving pace for the rest of the song. Though it might not end up being released as a single, “In My Head” has the best mix of vocals and synthetic sounds without being too annoyingly catchy.
Tegan and Sara prove to be fascinating guest artists on the final new track, “Every Chance We Get We Run.” One could argue it isn’t even a dance track: The mood and pace are relaxed — comforting, even. All of the hard-hitting beats are stripped away, showcasing Guetta’s versatility as a producer. The style is even uncharacteristic of Alesso, who helped produce the track. “Every Chance” proves a much-needed breather in a dance-heavy album.
Comparatively, it is difficult for the new songs on Nothing but the Beat 2.0 to match up to the titans on its predecessor. Tracks like “Turn Me On,” which features Nicki Minaj, are in a league of their own, combining star power and explosive sounds that similarly thrill from beginning to end. “I Can Only Imagine,” ever since its performance by Guetta, Chris Brown, and Lil’ Wayne at the 54th Grammy Awards, has been a staple at electronic music festivals and clubs alike.
And, finally, the euphoric “Without You” (featuring Usher) and “Titanium” seem to be untouchable, climbing Billboard charts with alarming speed since their debuts.
That isn’t to say that the six new tracks on the re-release will not be successful, but with fewer famous featured artists and less aggressive instrumentals, it’s hard to see how they could ever compare to that success.
Still though, Nothing but the Beat 2.0 isn’t anything to claw after. Fans who want to see a different side of Guetta should consider dropping a few bucks. You might be glad you did.
[…] Guetta’s re-release ‘Nothing’ to go crazy for That isn’t to say that the six new tracks on the re-release will not be successful, but with fewer famous featured artists and less aggressive instrumentals, it’s hard to see how they could ever compare to that success.

If you are a college student with a grasp on the indie music scene and have gone through a breakup of any seismic multitude since 2009, chances are you have heard of The xx.
The xx, a London-based trio best known for its ethereal and emotionally charged love songs made waves back in 2009 with their self-titled release off the Young Turks label. Right out of the gate, The xx established itself in the music scene with an instantly recognizable sound that capitalized on minimalism.
Three years later, The xx return a little older, a little wiser and ready to face the difficult challenge of coming out with a second album: what to do next?
The band’s new album Coexist, released Tuesday, is a statement of growth for the young trio. With its first album, The xx set a foundation of emotionally oozing pop songs, such as the profound and catchy tracks “Crystalised” and “Heart Skipped a Beat.” But Coexist strips away the unnecessary bells and whistles, leaving a pure sound reveling in lonely guitar riffs, the pattering of a steel drum and the hushed exclamations of love and longing.
Singers Romy Madley-Croft and Oliver Sim, childhood friends turned bandmates, evolved their songwriting, using real-life experiences to charge their songs with a more straightforward expression of emotion. Percussionist-producer Jamie xx’s beats have evolved as well to incorporate more dance vibes as the backbone to each song.
After the hype of the first album, The xx returned to London to look for new influences. Jamie Smith began crafting his unique beats as a solo project under the moniker Jamie xx. His solo DJ career has found its way into the new album and is very present in the pulsating beats of “Sunset,” “Swept Away” and “Reunion.”
Jamie xx’s contribution to Coexist is prominent; it is his crafting of the beats that perfectly complements the slow wails of guitar and fills pockets of silence with an understated yet captivating pulse that draws you in to each song.
The pangs of Jamie xx’s steel drum in “Reunion” transcends the slow longing of Madley-Croft’s and Sim’s voices, transforming the song from the simple ache of two long lost lovers to a dance-centric track.
The song begins with saddened proclamations of estranged love. Madley-Croft sings, “Did I, see you, see me / in a new light?” Cue Jamie xx. The beat swells. And you strangely find yourself dancing  to The xx — a rare occasion, but one that points to the evolution of their sound.
The xx was once largely defined by its valuing of silence as much as their use of sound. Now, that minimalism seems only to be a starting point.
The track “Missing” begins with soft percussions mimicking that of a heartbeat and a faint guitar line, as Sim drones “my heart is beating in a different way.” Then a three second pause.
Silence.
But suddenly Madley-Croft’s guitar arrives wailing. The percussion picks up, and Sim’s voice booms. Then a role reversal occurs as Sim and Madley-Croft each pick up verses where the other left off: Madley-Croft sings, Sim echoes. The singers never meet to directly duet — rather, they chase each other through the verses.
The album is also a testament to Sim’s growing confidence as a vocalist. “Fiction,” Sim’s first official solo, exemplifies the comfort his voice accumulated from extensive shows and touring. Here, Sim confesses romantic illusions against a tightly wound drum accompaniment. Sim is pushing his comfort zone as he experiments with his range, making “Fiction” one of the album’s most outstanding tracks.
On first listen, Coexist fails to deliver the can’t-get-out-of-your-head tunes of The xx’s previous album, which included songs such as “Basic Space” and “Islands.” “Angels,” the first single off the new album, simply comes and goes: Madley-Croft quietly yearns with nothing more than a liquid guitar line.
But listen again, and the intricacies of an evolved sound begin to win you over; Jamie’s stimulating beat grows more prominent, providing a solid foundation to each song while Sim’s voice and lyrical musings resonate a little stronger.
Coexist solidifies The xx’s uniquely hypnotic sound with programmed drums and ethereal guitar riffs. Though this album might take a bit longer to win you over, it demands attention all the same.
For past and future fans of The xx, Coexist will separate the wheat from the chaff. Given time, Coexist has the potential to endear you, as the songs grow more memorable as you listen.
And who knows? It could even be the soundtrack to your next breakup.
Was disappointed with my first listen…will give it a try again like you suggest
But I feel they should have given fans another round of the former style before ‘evolving’.

There aren’t many other ways to describe the film: Samsara is an experience.
In less than two hours, the movie travels around the globe, touching on love, death, time, space and even robotics.
There is very little to compare the film to — besides director Ron Fricke’s previous work Baraka — which makes Samsara a unique piece of cinema that needs to be experienced.
The name of the movie comes from the Sanskrit word for the cyclical nature of life. Fricke’s film embraces the concept, eschewing a narrative, characters and even dialogue for an audio-visual assault designed to draw connections to all aspects of the world.
Instead of a telling a story, Samsara flows around themes. In the film, the larger connections stem from a shared location or concept, be it parenthood, motion, organization or death.
The closest the film gets to a scripted scene is a sequence focused on the meat industry, where the stream of consciousness flow of the film is thrown out for a few minutes to focus on the life — and death — of animals that serve as food for humans. It’s jarring, because it’s the first in a series of truly visceral scenes scattered throughout the film.
The film is a visual masterpiece. Fricke, who also handled the cinematography, filmed the entire movie on sharp 70 mm film. Almost every frame can stand alone as a work of art. Sweeping panoramas and lush landscapes — often featuring unusual shapes or buildings — weave through the film, coming to life on the big screen as if viewers are seeing them first-hand. And the fact that the images come from natural occurrences around the world make them all the more magnificent.
Fricke assembles the movie through heavy use of montages and time lapses. Contrast and juxtaposition, rather than jarring transitions, bring stark visuals to life, such as a flyover of Shanghai’s slums that literally come within feet of modern luxury highrises. There’s a stunning sequence of Downtown Los Angeles at night that, in contrast to the nature-dominant early scenes, brings the film into the urban world and highlights a different community.
Samsara, however, isn’t just about landscapes and geography. It’s a showcase of humanity, and though each section is isolated from the another by distance and language, Fricke goes back time and again to the human element. He reuses the same set-up: a full-frontal close-up of the people on film, presenting them to the audience without gimmicks or motion.
Part of what makes this film so powerful is its music. Composer Michael Stearns and a team of collaborators put emotion and tone to the footage, delivering a mix ranging from peaceful ambient sounds to soaring arrangements. But the movie’s creators know when to dial back the music, letting the natural sounds of waterfalls or horns carry the scene.
Much of the film’s brilliance comes from the way it highlights parts of the world that are not really seen; Samsara focuses on remote locations and sections of life ignored by others. The film dives into slums, abandoned buildings and prisons. There is an unexpected but bouncy scene where dozens of Chinese inmates participate in a choreographed dance routine. It’s odd and unexplained but is completely captivating.
Most of these scenes are cheery or uplifting, but sometimes the film gets weird. There’s an unsettling scene in France involving an apparent performance artist who manically puts on clay masks and paints on them. If it were not so elegantly shot and edited, it wouldn’t fit with the flow or themes of the movie, but it looks just as good as the rest of the picture.
Samsara demands to be seen on the big screen. The film captivates and does more to tie its sections together with just strong editing and music than most scripted narratives.
Despite its lack of a story, Samsara manages to make a strong point: The world is more connected than one might imagine. The film is a testament to natural and man-made beauty.

Traffic. Even as the source of many Angelenos’ collective frustration, it surprisingly provides the only time we get to sit in one place.
And when we get stuck bumper-to-bumper, we try to find other modes of entertainment. If we simply sit in the car and let our eyes roam, they will undoubtedly fall on the towering visual signs dotting the streets: billboards. From movies to fast food to clothing stores, these eye-catching giants try to convince us to dole out money or switch on the TV.
But what if the billboard did something different? What if it made us stop and look closely without asking anything in return?
The street artist Uglar has answered with “Fly Vs. Elephant.”
But first, some background: Two years ago, Daniel Lahoda initiated the LA Freewalls project, a large-scale effort to bring more murals to the city streets. To bring that movement to the gallery scene, he also opened LALA Arts, which hosted two shows featuring works from street artists like Shepard Fairey, RISK, Zes and Uglar.
Public Works, the newest LALA project, undertakes a large and significant effort — repurposing the space of billboards and switching advertisements for art. The hand-painted and printed murals went up thanks to a partnership with MacDonald Media, which focuses on media that is “out-of-home,” according to their website.
What’s more, the billboards tend to show off the best of many street artists’ talent. Their works, unlike what we typically see, are entirely separated from promotion. Uglar’s work on Rampart Boulevard and Third Street especially brings issues of art versus commerce to light. An otherwise blank background features a giant fly head-to-head with an elephant. Though at first glance it’s comical or confusing, the piece serves as a testimony to the power of contemporary art.
Only in a visual work of this size can the enormity of the fictional fly come through. Only in art can such a small animal be rendered to a giant size with such detail. And only in this work will a fly and an elephant clash with each other in some unknown battle.
Public Works itself takes on a battle — adjusting the viewer’s eyes from routine advertisements to the complex artwork. The project also speaks to the power of street art — you don’t have to walk into a gallery, you don’t have to know the artist’s name. If a piece speaks to you, it does so automatically and perhaps when you least expect it to do so.
Uglar’s work stands close to a dentist office and across from other entirely normal businesses. A casual driver would find nothing remarkable about the intersection. Now, both visitors and longtime residents have something more to see. The work breaks up the monotony of normal travel with a visual treat that doesn’t require viewers to spend  money.
Street artists generally make art more communal and accessible, a characteristic  that Uglar’s work displays. In the street art world, anyone with a vision and the talent can use the streets as a canvas, but Uglar’s piece shows both finesse and a quirky vision bound to catch the attention of more than one passerby. It’s the same concept as an artist putting up a sticker, wheatpaste or poster on a concrete wall; Public Works just takes the idea to a larger and more powerful scale. Whether or not viewers approve of street art, the billboards will at least create a conversation about its importance.
Uglar’s work seems comical at first, but it offers a serious point: We need to use public space for more than advertisements. Our everyday visual culture should include art, not just symptoms of consumerism. It’s through art that we can explore our imagination, something that perhaps gets lost in the day-to-day commute.

Whether you’re looking to buy some fresh, local produce, support a good cause through baked goods or sample some authentic central American cuisine, the weekly farmers market on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street has you covered.
Home grown · The non-profit farmers market on Jefferson and Hoover takes its produce from sellers within 200 miles of the L.A. area. – Klaire Feng | Daily Trojan
Chase Mosley, who runs the farmers market, said that the market, open every Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., caters directly to USC students.
“We know a lot of students are not from California or local to this area and they don’t really have access to outside food, so we thought why not bring it here?” Mosely said.
Mosely makes it a point to get vendors who grow their food locally.
“When we say local, [the market is] within 200 miles of the farm, so you’re getting super fresh food,” Mosley said. “Strawberries … might have been picked at 2 a.m. this morning.”
A vendor passing by offers Mosley freshly squeezed orange juice. She thanks him by name. With that, Mosley explained that it is important for her to run the market like a family.
“I’ve worked with all of these people for a few years, if not longer,” Mosley said. “Before doing markets on my own, I worked for another company doing their market. I see how grateful the vendors are and how hard the farmers work.”
Mosely said that it is why her farmers market is a nonprofit.
“We don’t do it for the money, this doesn’t generate enough money for me to live off of … but I think it’s important to support small businesses,” Mosley said. “We are what makes the economy grow.”
Chloe Cotoulas, a senior majoring in critical studies, said that she comes to the market every Tuesday to buy produce.
“There are not that many options [for fresh food] right around the USC area,” Cotoulas said. “This is a nice change of pace without having to get in your car.”
Though the market is not close to his usual side of campus, Geoff Atkeisson, a second year master of business administration candidate, remains highly impressed with the farmers market’s selection.
“I’m at the business school, so I’m generally on the other side of campus,” Atkeisson said. “If I’m over here I will come back, though. The food is better and cheaper than what I can get at that side of campus. It’s just a matter of time.”
Nate Graeser, a second-year graduate student studying social work, said he always makes sure to drop by the market on Tuesdays.
“I like the fresh food and they have really good hummus here,” Graeser said. “Also, it feels like it’s more people oriented, more personal. I always feel like it’s good to support the small guys.”
If you’re interested in checking out the farmers market, here’s a snapshot of three booths and the stories behind them:
Pupusas Salvadorenas
Run by Ana Monreal, Pupusas Salvadorenas sells pupusas and fresh fruit juice.
Pupusas are a Central American dish that takes a handmade corn tortilla and stuffs it with a blend of cheese, jalapeños, vegetables, meat and sometimes beans. Monreal got her recipe from her husband’s grandmother, who owned restaurants in El Salvador before moving to the United States about 25 years ago.
Homeboy Bakery
Homeboy Bakery sells baked goods that help support a good cause: Homeboy Industries. The bakery, created by Fr. Greg Boyle, helps former gang members and citizens with a criminal history find jobs.
George Carillo, who works at Homeboy Bakery, struggled with sobriety but was able to turn his life around with the help of the company.
“Homeboy changed my life,” Carillo said. “It’s just a really good organization. Everyone is very encouraging and wanted me to do better.”
Carillo can’t help but recommend the coffee cake, a treat from his past.
“They had these in all the public schools in L.A. county,” Carillo said. “It makes me think of my [old school], except this has better ingredients.”
Gomez Farms
Over a year and a half ago, after watching Food Inc. on Netflix, Oscar Gomez was inspired to buy land in Riverside to start a farm.
“I didn’t want to give [the food featured on Food Inc.] to my children, so I bought a ten acre ranch and started growing everything myself,” Gomez said.
Currently, the farm is working with California Certified Organic Farmers to advertise their produce as completely organic.
“We don’t use any pesticides or anything on our produce — we only use river water to water our food, no city water,” Gomez said.
Gomez is very proud of what his farm produces. As for recommendations?
“Our [heirloom tomatoes], our strawberries, our grapes, all our fruit is delicious,” Gomez said.

In an effort to offer students options for lunch besides the usual dining halls and food court at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Traditions has decided to open its doors for lunch.
New addition · The Yard Burger, served on Traditions’ lunch menu, features tequila-lime-grilled chicken sandwiched between a toasted bun. – Shoko Oda | Daily Trojan
Traditions, more affectionately known to students as “Traddies,” has garnered the reputation as the campus’ quintessential sports bar, complete with pool tables, high-definition televisions and alluring dinner and snack options such as pulled pork quesadillas and a mean spinach-and-artichoke dip. But with these new hours, students can enjoy Traddies without having to wait until dinner.
Unlike the more creative dinner menu, though, the lunch menu is painfully straightforward. It comes down to three options: burgers, hot dogs and salads. The simple menu makes for faster decision-making, but the lack of variety is dismal.
And admittedly, Traddies’ afternoon vibe seems a bit off-kilter . Though the TVs show football highlights and the overhead lamps are dimly-lit for a cool, sophisticated effect, the chatty nighttime ambiance is replaced with awkward and hushed midday conversations.
Yet it is this relaxed atmosphere that makes Traddies an ideal place to meet with friends over burgers and fries. Traddies serves as an escape from the foot traffic and bedlam at EVK Restaurant and Grill during lunchtime rush hour and the long, winding lines coming out of Lemonade. There is no pushing and shoving during lunch at Traddies. Sit comfortably, enjoy the upbeat music and, on a hot day, escape the heat and relish the air conditioning.
But food, above all else, is the ultimate gauge when it comes to judging a restaurant — and Traddies conjures up mixed feelings.
The Yard Bird ($8.88), a tequila-lime-grilled chicken burger, did not meet expectations. It lacked the promised citrusy-tangy kick and ended up being a little dry.
Alluding to the founding of Trojan football, the 1888 Burger ($6.88), like the Yard Bird Burger, falls a little flat. Though the overall burger is tasty and the ingredients — crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, ripe tomatoes and savory grilled onions — are extremely fresh, the 1888 burger is somewhat of a letdown considering how small the patty is for how much it costs.
On the other hand, Traddies knows a thing or two about making decent hot dogs and fries.
The Transplant Dog ($5.85), named because “no one is really from L.A.,” brings together the mild sourness of sauerkraut and the distinct sharpness of brown mustard to create a tasty dog. More toppings would have made this hot dog exceptional, but regardless, the Transplant Dog is still more than agreeable.
And piled high with sweet relish, onions, tomato, hot peppers and celery salt, the Chi-Town Dog ($5.85) packs a tasty punch. The peppers are tame but maintain some heat, the sweet relish and onions create a perfect marriage of flavor and the buns, slightly toasted, add a nice crunch with every bite.
Of course, no bar menu is complete without good fries. Thank goodness Traddies has its own recipe for crispy, piping-hot shoestring fries.
At $2.25 for a large serving, these fries are perfect for sharing. These fries also come in three irresistible flavors of seasoning: Simplicity, BBQ-cuity and Mo-heat spicy. Though the BBQ and spicy seasonings are nearly indistinguishable from each other, these fries are still extremely addicting: Make sure to get at least one order for every two people at the table.
Since Traddies has only had experience serving dinner, it is not surprising that the restaurant still has some more work to do in terms of lunch. But there is a lot of potential: The service ought to be faster, but it will pick up as lunch at Traddies gains momentum.
As for the menu, more appetizers and entrees need to be added. Maybe some baked potato skins topped off with some bacon and garnished with chives? Fried okra and zucchini? Healthy pesto, tomato and mozzarella flatbreads and wraps for vegetarians?
Regardless, Traddies has a lot to offer in terms of good, solid American cuisine. Got a craving for excellent hot dogs and seasoned fries?
Traddies has an available table.
 
Traditions is open for lunch Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
This article fails to answer the most obvious question.

In today’s economy, student debt has become a critical concern, often having a remarkable influence on a student’s academic path.
As students become increasingly desperate to cut back on tuition costs, the concept of every student paying equal tuition has been called into question. Many question the fairness of a flat tuition policy when a university’s total tuition money — like USC’s — is not divided evenly across all schools and majors. Instead, more money is unfairly allocated to majors that require higher levels of investment.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
Academic programs with high budget costs — particularly those in technical and medical fields — have become modern scapegoats for rising tuition costs and expenditures, unfairly blamed for forcing all students to support programs that might be considered more prestigious and require more funding.
A recent study by the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute found that 29 percent of bachelor’s degree institutions use a variable tuition structure. Among the most common practices used in such a model is scaling tuition costs based on students’ majors. Under this system, fields of study such as business, engineering and nursing see higher tuition costs than less technical majors like narrative studies or psychology.
The concept of variable tuition can be easy to support, as its implementation would aim to fairly charge students only for the academic services they use. Putting such a model into practice, however, would result in more negative consequences than positive benefits.
First and foremost, USC’s vast variety of academic minors and electives make it almost impossible to put a finite value on the cost of a certain degree.
Additionally, variable tuition models dissuade students from following their passions and instead encourage them to pursue degrees based on their economic feasibility.
Not only does this prevent students from reaching their full learning potential, but it also strips universities of their status as “the great equalizers,” instead creating a system where privileged students have more opportunities to succeed in their learning than students from less fortunate backgrounds.
We cannot allow college education to assume a hierarchical structure under which certain sectors of higher education are only accessible to a limited selection of the student body.
Rather than implement variable college tuition, universities should instead invest more heavily in lower-cost programs and encourage cross-educational studies through minors, general education and elective programs. This way, all students can feel as though they are benefiting from top-tier professors and resources.
Though charging a flat-rate tuition to all students might not appear to be the fairest option, implementing a variable tuition model can only be detrimental to our university and its mission as an academic institution, as well as our intellectual mission as students.
Students should utilize the many opportunities that USC offers for cross-degree studies and interdisciplinary exploration to benefit from the money allocated to these programs. The small amount of money saved under a variable tuition model is nowhere near worth the cost of producing a generation of students who fail to reach their full potential because of financial restrictions.

Ryan, education is no different then any other commodity you purchase. Certain brands costs more because presumably you get more or because the value is such it is worth the higher cost to the buyer. Your proposal seems to say education and academia needs to adopt an artificial communistic policy that requires students wanting to study poetry or sculpture to pay the same tuition that medical and law students pay. Our society is taking too far a self entitled stand where we decry so many things ae not fair – including our own investment in ourselves. This also makes flip flopping majors too whimsical and superfiscal. Once you finish your four years in school you will discover many things are not seemingly fair. That is part of being an adult.

Question: Remember what President Barack Obama said about taxes and the rich at the Democratic National Convention? Now, remember Clint Eastwood’s speech to his empty chair at the Republican National Convention?
More than likely, the latter comes to mind much quicker, and it definitely was the story that received more coverage on the national media.
There is a growing trend among political reporters to focus on the superficial issues or fads of the election. This is not only annoying, but it is also a disservice to the American public.
So far this election, including the primaries, has seen reports on Eastwood’s chair, Rick Santorum’s sweater vests, jokes about who Nicki Minaj supports and even the question of whether the character of Bane in The Dark Knight Rises is an attack on Mitt Romney’s Bain Capital. How much do any of these issues affect the United States?
Reporters seem to be more interested in memes and quick jokes, all while making exaggerated comments about the election with no real facts or arguments to back them up.
This isn’t some attack on a liberal or conservative bias in the media — that’s another problem.
It’s one thing if pundits or journalists take sides on an issue, as long as there are facts and reporting — journalism — about the major issues involved. In the sphere of election reporting, journalists are failing to do their job.
Because of this failure, many important issues are being ignored.
Before the DNC, Obama hosted an “Ask Me Anything” on the popular social media website Reddit. In one of his answers to a Reddit user, Obama said he favors a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling on Citizens United, the landmark case in which the court essentially determined the right of corporations and unions to spend freely on election campaigns. This is major news on a policy that, if successful, could greatly affect all future elections. Yet somehow it received only a cursory amount of coverage from the few reporters on the AMA.
Another infrequently heard topic is Afghanistan. The war, which is now more than a decade long, was barely mentioned in Tampa, and neither candidate truly touched on the issues facing it. What about Afghan soldiers firing on NATO forces? What about corruption within the Afghan government? These are the questions the press should be asking, but they’re ignoring the subject almost as much as the politicians themselves are.
And then there are drones. The United States is currently in an active drone war, striking targets in Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia. It was reported by The New York Times that Obama has a “kill list” of targets for the drone war. The story has fallen to the wayside and no one has asked Romney if he would continue the plan (he has, for the record, said he would continue to order drone strikes).
Oh, and it has been more than a year since Obama introduced the jobs bill, one that Congressional Republicans continually block. With blame flying around about the economy and poor job growth, it would make sense for this to be brought up. But it rarely is.
This isn’t to say that all political reporting is bad. There are excellent reporters covering the 2012 election, and they deserve to be commended for it. And there is nothing wrong with laughing at the absurdity of the campaigns — they have been very weird, and humor is a beautiful thing.
But this isn’t some bad movie that can be joked about. This is the election of the next president and a new Congress. These things matter. The press has certain responsibilities to meet as the Fourth Estate that must inform the public of what issues and news matter.
There are less than 60 days until the election. Hopefully the press decides to stop with the cheap memes and address the real issues. People will be voting no matter what, but it might be good for them to be informed about the real issues in the race.
 
Nicholas Slayton is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism. 
People say there is this RACE problem and this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and ONLY into White countries. They say the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY White country and ONLY White countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-Whites. It’s really just the final solution to the White problem. It’s genocide. They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White. Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White.
The most important issue this election is the one that no one is talking about.  It’s the program of genocide being carried our against people of European or “white” origin.  This is how it’s happening.
1) Immigrants from the “developing world” are flooded into the West.
2) These immigrants and any national minorities are then forced integrated with the White populations, communities, and institutions. This is made law by removing freedom of association, creating affirmative action and requiring racial quotas.  Whites who wish to move from these dangerous, integrated communities are forced to live in expensive suburban or exurban areas (which will be forced integrated over time anyway) which makes having large families difficult.  Anyone who objects to this is denied economic opportunities, status, and in some cases freedom itself.
3) An information campaign is implemented which demonizes Western culture and history. The old myths that helped form the identities of the West are replaced with new mythologies that make Whites into enemies of humanity and non-whites (like MLK) as morally superior heroes. People who oppose mass immigration and forced integration are portrayed as mentally ill, evil, and lacking positive human qualities.  Miscegenation is encouraged and glorified.  The people of the West are constantly reminded of the inevitable brown future and that anything short of celebrating this makes you a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.
This system leads to the end of the White-European people.
Article 2 of the UN convention on Genocide:
In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
 (a) Killing members of the group;
 (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
 (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
 (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
 (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
When will someone have the guts to stand up against the genocide of White people?

In a world where everyone knows the name Honey Boo Boo Child and the final two couples on Bachelor Pad, it’s easy to overlook the authenticity of an established television genre that has been entertaining audiences for over 60 years: the late-night talk show.
As of recently, it seems like many Americans take pleasure in turning their favorite late-night talk show hosts into reality show characters, pitting them against one another and salivating at any bad blood that may exist between them.
When NBC had the monumental idea to force Jay Leno to prematurely retire and award Conan O’Brien with The Tonight Show five years before he’d even stepped on the monologue mark, everyone was just shocked when the peacock execs cooled off to the idea (talk about raising expectations). Clearly, this shake-up didn’t help to relieve any existing feelings of animosity, but instead intensified fan loyalties for the network stars to an almost morbid extreme.
And now to make things more interesting, the popular as ever Jimmy Kimmel is being thrown into the 11:30 mix along with Leno and David Letterman. The battle lines are once again being re-drawn, and it’s hard not to think that something (or, someone) has to give for one man to win the historically coveted time slot. Fascinating stuff, of course, but also perhaps a distraction from what really matters — their shows.
We’re all guilty of flagging our favorite late night “guy” or “girl” (we see you, Chelsea Handler) based on superficial and judgmental criteria. “Dave’s too old.” “Conan’s too quirky.” “Stewart and Colbert are too political.” “Jay’s not funny.”
Yes, ratings are important. Yes, taunting the “other guy” is fun. But when we audaciously pick apart these hosts who literally live to make us laugh at the end of a long day, it begs the question: Can’t we just sit back and enjoy it?
Very few people have the talent to entertain us right before we go to bed. There’s still something pretty magical about a host being affectionately greeted by an enthusiastic audience, watching a glamorous movie star let loose and be self-deprecating or creating next-day viral moments with a hilarious bit.
Even though we enjoy the behind-the-scenes gossip, don’t forget to appreciate the fact that late night gives us permission to laugh at the absurdities of life on a nightly basis. In such serious times, we still very much need Kimmel’s Unnecessary Censorship, Dave’s Top Ten List, Leno’s Headlines and Conan’s Fan Corrections. And a Snooki joke never hurts.

As the new minor in health care studies kicks off this fall, the horizon looks rosy. A part of a new-era partnership between USC Dornsife and the Keck School, the minor allows students a glimpse into research and clinical practice, and even more exciting, the bigger picture surrounding health care today.
The minor includes classes at the USC Health Sciences campus, exposing students to even more of the rich resources that a university like USC has to offer, from Keck medical professors to state-of-the-art leading laboratories and hospitals.
This also gives students the chance to explore the health care issues of our time in a very hands-on setting. For example, a biomedical research course will allow students the freedom to structure original hypothesis-driven projects through experimental work.
While some may gripe about the intensity of the minor’s courses—neuroanatomy, histology and surgery are a few on the list—the fascinating content of these courses should be worth the workload. The program is especially good for pre-med students, providing a more complete preview of the field of study they will undertake a few years down the road.
However, pre-med is not the only field that fits this minor. Multidisciplinary in approach, the minor will examine contemporary issues in health care, such as the ethics of running a health care practice. Today’s health care issues see a myriad of repercussions in sectors including business, communications, marketing and law, an understanding of which would enrich any undergraduate education. Students will eventually become the people making important decisions in all of these fields.
With new technologies and discoveries emerging at rapid pace, the health care horizon is full of promise. Health sciences will be the perfect choice of minor for any student dedicated to studying the bigger picture of a field that is advancing so fast and that dominates so many aspects of life in today’s America

After Saturday’s 42-29 victory against the Syracuse Orangemen at MetLife Stadium, the USC Trojans maintained their No. 2 ranking in the AP poll and fell to No. 3 in the USA Today Coaches’ poll.
USC was able to pull out a double-digit win, but struggled in the second half to put away the Orangemen. Syracuse outscored the Trojans 13-7 in the third quarter and closed the gap to 21-16 going into the fourth.
The Trojans were jumped in the USA Today Coaches’ poll by the LSU Tigers after LSU blew out USC’s Pac-12 competitors, the Washington Huskies, 41-3. USC still has more first-place votes than the Tigers (11 to 5), but LSU has more total points with 1380 compared to 1363.
In the AP poll, the Trojans maintained their No. 2 ranking but gave up some headway to the Tigers, who now trail them by just 10 points.
Four other schools from the Pac-12 are in both the AP and USA Today Coaches’ polls. Oregon remains at No. 4 in both polls, while Stanford sits at No. 21 and No. 16, respectively. Two new teams entered the fray this week: UCLA, No. 22 in AP and No. 23 in USA Today, and Arizona, No. 24 in AP and No. 25 in USA Today. USC will face off against Stanford on Saturday at Stanford Stadium in a matchup of ranked Pac-12 squads.

At first glance, it may seem like the bicycle debate at USC is unnecessary.
However, if one takes the time to stop and think, one realizes that this dilemma affects the day-to-day life of every student here. Having all been made late by bike congestion and seen or been part of a bike collision at least once, most of us can see why new rules regulating the use of bikes on campus are needed.
For the first time, however, USC has also included the potential danger of skateboards in the bike safety discussion. For the first time, skateboarders aren’t just getting the pedestrian treatment—they now have to walk their skateboards wherever students have to walk their bikes.
Sure, skateboarders may go a bit slower than bikes while on campus. However, the fact that that the only breaks are the strength and good timing of the rider make them even more dangerous. Plus, they are more difficult to steer, making weaving in and out of people all the more dangerous.
Skateboard accidents also have a greater risk of injury to the rider. When you get into a bike accident, you fall off your bike. It may hurt, it may cause some damage, but chances are that you managed to slow down at least a little to lessen the blow.
On a skateboard, however, you can fly off from impact with a mere pine cone. The security of a brake system doesn’t even apply.
It also does not help that copious amounts of boarders think that Trousdale is the site of the next X Games. Attempting to land tricks or rush speedily to class puts everyone in danger.
Skateboarders need to remember that they are not pedestrians. Their mode of transportation puts them in the same sphere as bicycle riders, and those walking on campus need to be protected by this potentially dangerous form of transportation.
As long as skateboarders adhere to the new rules, and walk their skateboards along side their bicycle-riding peers, then congestion and harmful accidents on campus can be avoided.
See, the problem with your entire opinion here, is that factually you are wrong. Skateboarders are pedestrians.  Look it up, its California law.  As someone who has gotten a ticket from LAPD for skateboarding in a bike lane, I can personally attest to it.

While some high school students covet popularity, a joint study conducted by the University of Southern California and the University of Texas found that their lungs could suffer from it.
The study’s findings, featured online this week in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found a positive correlation between students’ popularity and smoking. The study, which focused on seven Southern California high schools, confirmed a trend observed in other USC-led studies of secondary school students in the United States and Mexico.
Thomas W. Valente, a professor of preventative medicine and lead author of three prior studies on the subject, said this phenomenon is anything but new.
“Adolescence is a time when students turn to others to figure out what is important,” Valante said in a press release. “These are four different samples, now, coming from different places — and the finding is consistent.”
The new study surveyed nearly 2,000 ninth and 10th grade students about their smoking habits, their peer’s smoking habits and opinions and who their five best friends at school were.
Students who were most frequently named as friends by others tended to start smoking earlier. The study also found that the students who thought their friends smoked were more likely to smoke, even if they were wrong, and that smokers tended to be friends with other smokers.
Valente said this trend has been consistent during the past decade.
“That we’re still seeing this association more than 10 years later, despite marginal declines in smoking, suggests that popularity is a strong predictor of smoking behavior,” Valente said in a press release.
Great article.

Ever had one (or more) of those “Last Friday Night” moments where you woke up, opened your computer and found mortifying videos of yourself from that crazy party yesterday plastered all over Facebook and Twitter for the world to see?
If so, there is still a way to save your reputation. Züm, an iPhone app that allows users to send and receive “no regrets” videos to friends, is now available for download in the app store. Andrew Ramirez, a USC alumnus and one of the guys behind this ingenious and college-friendly app, gives a more in-depth look at züm and its future plans.
Daily Trojan: What is your role in the development of the züm app?
Andrew Ramirez: Myself and a few other guys at the studio have been mainly involved in debugging and testing the app, giving our programmers plenty of feedback ranging everywhere from the overall experience of it — how to make it more streamlined, more user-friendly, addictive — down to the color scheme and “look” of that little icon sitting there with all your other apps.
DT: What inspired the creation of züm?
Ramirez: Züm was borne out of that terrible, terrible Drake YOLO movement. Despite hating the acronym, we loved that “you only live once” attitude. And we started thinking: what does it mean to be regret-free in 2012? How do you adopt a loose-and-quick attitude when every silly thing you do is documented and researched by family, girlfriends, boyfriends and bosses? What we discovered was YOLO means not leaving a trail. Nothing to trace back or bring next-morning embarrassment. So voilà, züm. These little five-second videos that get messaged among zümmers can only be watched once and then forever erased. Users are free to be as funny or wholesome or naughty as they want, it’s completely up to them. But if they wanted to be a little edgier, züm isn’t a bad place to start …
DT: What are some of the craziest things you’ve heard about or witnessed people using züm for?
Ramirez: People flaunt their creative side when alcohol is involved. Bar zümming is getting very popular because it’s a good way to let your friends know all about the massive amounts of fun you’re having … Any examples? Let your imagination run with it …
DT: What words of advice would you like to share with up-and-coming mobile app developers?
Ramirez: Your users are key, especially when you’re small. Word of mouth is very potent, and if someone’s friends are digging it, naturally they’ll want to dig it too. Inversely, if someone’s friends are really not liking something, that person might become a walking pundit trashing something they haven’t even tried.
DT: What’s next for züm?
Ramirez: Currently, we’re touring the app at bars and clubs all around LA — more specifically in the USC area although we also just hosted an event at TigerHeat and Public House, too. And next? We’re gearing up for the züm U.S. tour.
Updates, photos and the schedule for züm’s U.S. tour for can be found on Facebook and Twitter.
