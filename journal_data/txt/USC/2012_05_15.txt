The USC women’s tennis team has reached the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament after taking down Fairfield and Vanderbilt.
In the first round of the tournament, USC (22-3) took advantage of playing on their home court as they beat4 Fairfield (14-7) 4-0 at Marks Stadium on Friday. The Women of Troy raced out to an early lead against the Stags after taking the doubles’ point behind the the stellar play the No. 3 squad of sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria. The duo posted an 8-0 shutout on court 1, and on court 3 the tandem of senior Alison Ramos and junior Danielle Lao did the same against the Fairfield pair of Jackson-Pirrello.
During singles play, USC didn’t notch a win on the first three courts because the bottom of their order finished the match before they had a chance. The Women of Troy received a great outing from the second half of their singles lineup leaving No. 13 Zoe Scandalis one set short of recording her first true NCAA tournament victory (she was up 6-0, 5-0 on court 1).
Breaking through first was freshman Gabriella DeSimone on court 5 as she posted a dominant 6-0, 6-1 score line to put USC up 2-0 on the day. Rounding out the 4-0 score were Ramos and the 87th-ranked Chrstian, who combined for just one dropped set between the two.
On Saturday, the Women of Troy took down the Vanderbilt Commodores 4-1 in their last home match of the season. USC once again started off strong out of the gate stealing the doubles point behind wins on each court, though Vanderbilt put up a fight on both court 1 and 2 stretching both matches out. Court 1 provided the Christian-Santamaria pairing with a formidable challenge from the No. 30 pair of Wu-Mira as they eked out an 8-6 victory to end the doubles round.
In the singles portion, Vanderbilt (17-8) provided stiff competition across the board, but USC’s depth proved to be too much for the Commodores.
Junior Valeria Pulido started off singles with a blowout victory against Vandy’s Megan Gornet with a 6-0, 6-0 shutout. Vanderbilt struck back quickly, winning their only match on the day behind Marie Casares’s defeat of Sabrina Santamaria on court 3 6-2, 6-3.
Juniro Danielle Lao struck back in second singles, taking down the 94th-ranked Lauren Mira 6-2, 6-3, and Kaitlyn Christian finished up the match with a comeback victory over Ashleigh Antal 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 on court 4.
Scandalis survived a tough first set tiebreaker against No. 42 Jackie Wu before her match was cut short and Gabriella DeSimone had her hands full on court 5 just before the day was over.
The Women of Troy will look to stay in top form against the Baylor Bears on Thursday in Athens, Ga.

The USC Trojan Marching Band traveled to London on Monday to play in three concerts this week at Canary Wharf, Potters Field and Trafalgar Square, as part of the band’s pre-Olympics tour. The band will return home May 21.
Every other year since 1988, band director Arthur Bartner has led the ensemble on an international trip. Bartner said he chose London for the 2012 excursion because of excitement in Great Britain’s capital with the Summer Olympics, which begin July 27, and the celebration of Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee, which recognizes her 60th year of reign.
“We’re going to offer our kids a wonderful experience and different culture,” Bartner said.

The band’s biennial trips are always associated with an event and are often related to pre-Olympics celebrations. Whether playing in a torch relay or taking a pre-Olympics tour, the Spirit of Troy has been associated with the 1984, 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002 Olympic Games.
“This is one of the unique things that we’re able to do in the Trojan Marching Band,” Bartner said. “It enhances our band program as a worldwide organization. We’ve been to Australia, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Paris . . . and this gives us a worldwide reputation.”
Chris Roman, a junior in the band who did not go to London, said the trip provides the band with an opportunity to display spirit off-campus and to maintain its reputation.
“I think it’s a good opportunity for us to show our school spirit off-campus because we are a spirit organization, but we are not just spirited at basketball games or football games,” Roman said. “It also helps solidify our reputation as one of the biggest and best college bands out there.”
Bartner said the Spirit of Troy will showcase a marching band style that differs from that of a traditional British band.
“The concerts are the most fun because the British band tradition is very different than ours,” Bartner said. “It’s very stoic. For a lot of [Londoners], this will be the first time they see our marching band culture.”
Brett Padelford, director of public relations for the USC Trojan Marching Band, said the trip is an opportunity for the band to serve as representatives for the university abroad.
“I like to say we’re the international ambassadors for the university,” Padelford said. “Football is huge in America, but they don’t really understand American football overseas, so we are the overseas ambassadors.”
Padelford said the trip is unique and is fitting, given USC’s international presence in athletics. USC is the only university to have an athlete win a gold medal in every summer Olympic games since 1912.

Following eight months of negotiations, USC obtained day-to-day control of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in a vote by the Coliseum Commission on Monday.
The stadium’s nine-member governing body, represented by officials from the state, county, and city, voted 8-1 to surrender control of the facility and of the adjacent L.A. Sports Arena to the university for at least 20 years. The sole dissenting vote was cast by L.A. City Councilmember Bernard Parks, who has long opposed the amended lease as currently drafted.
Adrian Hoffman | Daily Trojan
The lease has five renewal options that would allow USC to control the stadium through 2054 — beyond the initial 20 years. The Coliseum Commission will also continue to oversee both facilities until the commission’s dissolution in 2054.
“We look forward to restoring the Coliseum to its former glory and ensuring its viability for many generations to come,” said Thomas Sayles, USC’s senior vice president for university relations, in a statement.
USC will be tasked with event scheduling, along with funding various improvements and restorations that are expected to total approximately $70 million. As a result, the university will be given control over revenue and will be allowed to negotiate the sale of the naming rights to the Coliseum. USC’s football team has been a tenant at the stadium since the Coliseum’s opening in May 1923.
In June 2011, the commission acknowledged it would be unable to make nearly $60 million in necessary renovations to the Coliseum, breaking the terms of the original lease with USC that was signed in 2008, which led the university to seek day-to-day management of the venue and the neighboring Sports Arena.

Kenneth Leventhal, a USC trustee and real estate accountant known for his leadership, energy and philanthropy, died May 8. He was 90.
Leventhal had prostate cancer, according to the Los Angeles Times.
As a USC life trustee, the leader of two fundraising campaigns and the namesake of the School of Accounting, Leventhal was heavily involved in university affairs.

Stan Ross, a business partner who had known Leventhal for 50 years, said Leventhal’s attachment to the university only increased with time.
“He had such strong feelings about the university throughout the years and they just grew stronger,” said Ross, who also chairs the board of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate. “He felt strongly that USC had a wonderful curriculum and academic program and that the faculty were really excellent.”
In 1995, Leventhal and his wife, Elaine Otter Leventhal, bequeathed $15 million to USC’s accounting school, which was named in their honor the following year. The Leventhals pledged an additional $10 million during a 10-year fundraising drive, which Kenneth Leventhal led.
When completed in 2002, the campaign had raised more than $2.85 billion for USC.
A graduate of UCLA, Leventhal became an active USC supporter after his alma mater ended its accounting program, said Ken Merchant, a former dean of the Elaine and Kenneth Leventhal School of Accounting.
“UCLA, some years ago, decided to do away with their accounting majors, and he thought that was a colossal mistake,” Merchant said. “He sort of gravitated toward USC and became one of their best friends over the years.”
His firm, Kenneth Leventhal & Co., which was involved in some of the nation’s largest real estate transactions, gained a reputation for its partners’ expertise and knowledge of real estate, said William W. Holder, dean of the Leventhal School of Accounting. Holder said, as a result, the firm was able to attract high-profile clients, such as Ray Watt and William Lyon.
“He attracted, very early on, some of the giants in California real estate,” Holder said. “As they prospered, his firm prospered.”
Holder described Kenneth Leventhal’s business manner as incisive.
“He was purposeful, he was very intelligent [and] he was direct,” said Holder, who occasionally worked on retainer with Leventhal’s firm. “He didn’t waste a lot of time.”
Kenneth Leventhal believed the accountant’s role should extend beyond audits or preparing financial statements, Holder said.
“I think he had an abiding belief that an accountant’s perspective and knowledge could be a very valuable source for good in the management and operation of a company,” Holder said.
When Kenneth Leventhal was 10, his paper route manager at the Herald-Express was taking a course in accounting and told him he needed only a pencil to become an accountant, according to a statement from President C. L. Max Nikias. Leventhal felt that a nickel for a pencil was a small price to pay to be his own boss and began working toward becoming an accountant.
“I figured I could always raise a nickel for a pencil,” Leventhal said to the Los Angeles Times in 1985.
Leventhal attended UCLA on the G.I. Bill, having served in the army during World War II. While at UCLA, he met and married his wife, Elaine.
“He was kind of a rags to riches story,” Merchant said. “He didn’t have a lot of money.”
In 1995, Kenneth Leventhal & Co., the firm that he and his wife had built, merged with Ernst & Young.
At the time of the merger, the firm ran 13 offices nationwide and ranked as the ninth-largest certified public accounting firm in the country.
Leventhal is survived by his wife, Elaine; his brother, Henley; his son Robert; his son Ross and daughter-in-law Mary Jo; and his granddaughter Emma.
The university plans to host a celebration of Leventhal’s life in the fall, Nikias said.
“Ken was truly an extraordinary individual and the conscience of the university,”  Nikias said.

Nearly 14,000 graduates were honored Friday as USC marked its 129th annual commencement ceremony with a keynote address from award-winning journalist Christiane Amanpour.
Amanpour is the third female speaker since 1983.
In her speech, she urged the new alumni to face their future with courage.
Keynote · Christiane Amanpour, a correspondent for ABC News, delivered the commencement address to the class of 2012 and encouraged the nearly 14,000 graduates to pursue careers that they are passionate about. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“Times are tough; I know the economy and the job market [don’t] look fantastic, but you … are the best equipped to come into this environment right now,” Amanpour said. “[God] has given all of us — all of you — exceptional talents, and what counts is what you do with them.”
Amanpour encouraged students to find vocations that they could be passionate about.
“Find something that sets you on fire,” she said. “But I hope that you don’t feel the need to hurry too much on the road. Don’t be too impatient. Don’t feel entitled. Don’t feel that the world owes you or that you have to be at the top of your profession a week after leaving graduate school or a week after leaving your university.”
Chase Blood, who graduated with a master’s degree in building science, said Amanpour’s address was reassuring.
“Her speech was full of things that you can stamp on your heart for the rest of your life,” Blood said. “It was definitely encouraging to hear that you don’t always have to work for the big company; you don’t always have to do the same things our parents did to be successful in your career.”
But not all students were satisfied with Amanpour’s speech.
David Crary, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in applied and computational mathematics, said he thought her message was underwhelming.
“Her speech was uninspired and disappointing, and she offered poor advice throughout,” Crary said. “She said you shouldn’t worry about being the best, which I feel conveys mediocrity.”
USC President C. L. Max Nikias conferred honorary degrees to USC’s Nisei alumni, first generation Japanese-American students who were forced to abandon their studies  during the internment of Japanese nationals and American citizens of Japanese descent in the 1940s.
Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“The entire university community feels privileged to honor you [Nisei  alumni] for your accomplishments,” Nikias said.
USC also recognized seven other honorary degree recipients for their accomplishments, including philanthropic leader Julie Mork; CEO of Energy Corp. of America and USC Trustee John Mork; entrepreneur Armas C. “Mike” Markkula; pharmaceuticals scientist Victoria Hale; international humanitarian Dana Dornsife; USC Trustee David Dornsife; and Canadian Sen. Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire.
The university acknowledged three students for their work: salutatorians Sonam Kapadia, who majored in biological sciences and health promotion and disease prevention studies, and Ryan Hill, who majored in biological sciences and kinesiology, and valedictorian Genevieve Hoffman, who majored in economics and international relations. Hoffman asked the graduates to use their knowledge as a means of bettering the world.
“Our education at USC has given us the skills to be important and positive contributors,” Hoffman said.
 
Austin Byron contributed to this report. 
“Amanpour is the third female speaker since 1983.”
I’m sorry but for a country with roughly half the population is female…that’s pretty sad.
Get a life you old people!  No ones cares about your history.
George, you too will be old someday…if you live long enough.
Congrsats! to all recent graduates.
I’m in my forties and I wrote a book on the subject. The State of Texas, one of the three largest states has just required German American internment be taught in k12. Latinos are starting to take an interest because some of those Germans were married to Spanish women. There is a Latino side of the internment and it is tied inexorably to the Germans.
Boring!  Move on Bob, no one cares!
Now you know about it. On to the next person!
Let’s not forget the Japanese, German and Italian Immigrants who were not interned. Remember, Japanese who lived in the interior were not sent to camps as a matter of course. All three groups were required to live under restrictions that are comparable to registered sex offenders today. Curfews, FBI approval required for every job, every 14 year old immigrant and up required to be issued special id labeling them as Enemy Alien. 
Let’s also not forget the Japanese Americans who were given scholarships from the camps to attend universities and it goes on
Mediocrity is accepting an honorary degree for being Nisei. None of we German internees were granted “honorary degrees” we had to earn them after gaining release in 1947 &48. We also did not receive an apology nor the $20,000  that each Japanese received. Unknown too, is that 6,000 Nisei renownced their US born citizenship, received the same rewards stated, whereas not a single GermanAmerican renownced his/her  US born citizenship.
The continued xenophobic hatred of anything German since 1914 deprives all of the rich heritage that this ethnc group can provide.
I was interned in Crystal City Texas where only half the inmates were Japanese.And I was there 2 years after they left, being 17 going in and 22 when leaving a free man.
Too bad, another opportunity missed to let the world know that German Americans and Italian Americans were also interned in the U.S. during WWII.  And to let the world know that they have not received $20,000, an apology, and a host of other awards and recognition..not even for their service in the armed forces of the United States.
One the truth will be known!

After being swept by No. 5 Oregon over the weekend, USC is on a skid unlike any the team has experienced all season. Seven consecutive losses, spanning the entire month of May, put the Trojans under .500 for the first time in 2012. The Trojans have lost 10 of their last 12 games and 14 of their last 17. Since they opened the season 12-3, the Trojans have gone just 10-21 to bring their overall record down to 22-24 (7-16 in Pac-12 play).
Solid effort · Freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley pitched well against the Ducks but was unable to lead the Trojans to a victory. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
This weekend epitomized the recurring problems the Trojans have faced all season: decent pitching plagued by anemic hitting. The Trojans scored eight runs over the three games against the Ducks and have plated just 13 on their seven-game skid.
On Sunday against the Ducks the Trojans’ short-lived 1-0 lead was the result of an error. Freshman second baseman Andres Rodriguez knocked a double with two outs in the second, but only scored because Oregon shortstop J.J. Antobelli couldn’t handle a ground ball by senior centerfielder Garret Houts.
The Trojans returned the favor in the fourth. Freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley walked the first two batters of the inning to put runners on first and second. The Ducks attempted a sacrifice bunt, but the Trojans’ hurried throw to first was wild, tying the game and allowing all runners to advance an extra base.
Tarpley showed good mental grit to get out of the ensuing second and third with just the one run allowed. And USC looked to be in the driver’s seat when senior first baseman Matt Foat hit his third home run of the season in the fifth, a two-run shot to give the Trojans a 3-1 lead.
But Tarpley and the Trojans fell apart in the sixth. A leadoff walk followed by a double, RBI single and a sacrifice fly tied the game and chased Tarpley from the mound. Senior Brandon Garcia came on to stop the bleeding, but a bunt single gave the Ducks a 4-3 lead.
The Trojans threatened in the top of the eighth, putting runners at the corners with one out, but they were stranded. The Ducks tacked on two more in the bottom of the inning to cruise to a 6-3 win.
Such seemed to be the story for the Trojans on Saturday and Sunday as well. USC jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Saturday, but the Ducks plated a run in the second, third and fourth to jump in front 3-1 and went on to take a 4-2 victory.
On Friday USC fell a run short of an impressive comeback against Oregon pitcher Alex Keudell and lost 4-3.
Just a month ago, when the Trojans were 19-10 coming off a thrilling series win against a talented Cal team that is fighting for a postseason berth, USC was eying a shot at its first postseason appearance since 2005. That appears to be squarely out of the question now, especially with their last two Pac-12 series coming against top-15 teams in Arizona and UCLA.
Actually Triggs,Viramontes,Foat,Landecker,Sherrod should all have a look in the upcoming draft.All have had outstanding years given the circumstances.Two- three hitters cant do it all.Other teams know who they shouldnt pitch to..
I’ll say my final piece and fade away… For three seasons I’ve followed this team closely and said little. Like so many, it was hard not to get overly excited this year by the team’s great start. I tempered my enthusiasm with realistic expectations that you can’t fix everything overnight. All in all, I think these boys did a much better job this season considering…
Here are my parting thoughts for what their worth…
1. If you are going to have a team made up primarily of undersized players, they better be quick, fast, crafty on the pads and hungry… Dante Flores is one great example. Cruz seems to be working on it!
2. Bats, bats, bats… how disappointing, what else can I say? Tuff life for SC pitchers round these parts. Again, Cruz must be working on it!
3. Pitching – to be blunt, we are simply being out coached here! The SC pitch sequence is so d@mn predictable that my 80 year old mum can tell you what comes next!  … 0-2 – waste pitch, 1-2 – fishing pitch (inside fastball or outside corner non-strike hoping for a swing – scouted… no swing),  2-2 only now will the opposing batter become mildly interested… the same, every game, every time, every pitcher, opposing coaches and batters know it, announcers (and yes, my dear old mum) know it… pitch counts skyrockets and bad things happen!  SC pitchers aren’t allowed to be aggressive, they can’t get into any sort of a rhythm with all those frequent long calls from the dugout on every pitch, they arn’t allowed to go after batters on 0-2, and all pitchers are pitched as though they are the same type of guy! It is almost like Hubbs is playing a video game from the sideline, staring excessively into his notebook and mashing buttons trying to pitch to the batter’s weaknesses as opposed to pitching pitchers to their strengths! Your staff is better than that! 
4. The fan experience, better numbers in the stands this year for sure! There was a buzz, Triggs at his best and Tarpley and his freshman cohort’s always seemed to put on a good show! Announcing both over the net and at the stadium was flat out embarrassing most of the time. I so looked forward to away games so that I could “feel” as though I was experiencing a top notch ballgame for a change!
5. Media coverage, again, very poor. Almost as though the school is ashamed of the baseball program. But this year we actually had a team to be proud of! Still, in the beginning I frequently had to look to competitor’s websites to find out good stuff about our own players! With no promotion and no pride, how do you expect to attract top-notch recruits?
Well I guess I’ve ranted enough! Triggs, best of luck in the draft! Tarpley, stay thirsty my friend! Best of luck to the rest of the seniors! All others, Fight On!
The team has lost eight in a row after getting beat by WSU last night (3-1) up at Pullman. School is out and so is
the season for all intent and purposes. Some good seniors leaving who never made it to the postseason. The
great tradition of USC BASEBALL is a fading memory with no help from the athletic dept. these days.

No. 3 USC lost a defensive battle to No. 1 Stanford 6-4 on Sunday in the NCAA tournament final, as the Cardinal fended off multiple comeback bids from the Women of Troy to claim its second straight women’s water polo championship.
The Women of Troy fought back from a one-goal deficit four separate times, and the score was tied 4-4 after freshman driver Monica Vavic scored in the first minute of the final period.

But the Cardinal found the back of the net twice more and USC ran out of time to come back.
“We had many opportunities to take the lead in the fourth quarter,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “But we just kept hitting bars left and right, and their goalie made some good stops.”
Stanford goalkeeper Kate Baldoni was named tournament MVP after recording 15 saves in the championship match, and her counterpart, USC sophomore Flora Bolonyai, made nine saves against the Cardinal.
Four of Stanford’s goals were scored on power plays, and Vavic said he was proud of his squad for holding strong defensively against a powerful Cardinal attack.
“Stanford is an offensively oriented team. We did a good job to hold them to five [goals] until the final minutes,” Vavic said. “It gave us a chance to close the game in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, we couldn’t do it.”
One day after converting 12 of their 29 attempts in a 12-10 semifinal win over No. 2 UCLA, USC scored on just four of 30 shots against the Cardinal. Sophomore two-meter Madeline Rosenthal gave the Women of Troy an early lead when she scored with 5:12 left in the first period. It would turn out to be USC’s only lead in the match.
Stanford evened the score just 33 seconds later with a 6-on-5 strike and added another power play goal with 2:23 left.
Sophomore two-meter Colleen O’Donnell tied it up at 2-2 in the final minute, but the Cardinal took advantage of another USC ejection to take a 3-2 lead into the second quarter.
Neither team broke through again until the third period, when junior two-meter Patricia Jancso converted a penalty shot to make the score 3-3.
But Stanford went ahead again just 10 seconds later, and after Monica Vavic leveled the score early in the final period, the Cardinal pulled away after scoring at the 4:13 and 1:11 marks.
Despite the letdown, Vavic said the atmosphere in the locker room after the match was positive, and said his team has a good chance to bring the championship home next year after losing only three seniors.
“We’re going to train and play some matches this summer that are going to help us improve,” Vavic said. “We have a couple of good players joining us next year from the Olympics; we’re going to be better next year.”
Jancso, Monica Vavic and sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist were named to the NCAA All-Tournament First Team and Bolonyai earned a spot on the NCAA All-Tournament Second Team.

After kicking off the NCAA championships with two sweeps, the men’s tennis team looks to string together four more wins to capture its fourth-consecutive NCAA title.
In front of a home crowd at Marks Stadium, No. 1 USC (29-1) posted a 4-0 victory against Fairfield (16-5) on Saturday, followed by another 4-0 win against No. 30 Texas A&M (14-15) on Sunday to advance to the round of 16 at Athens, Ga.
The Trojans, who hold the top seed in the tournament, eliminated the Aggies behind freshman Roberto Quiroz’s 6-1, 6-3 clincher over Jackson Withrow.

USC set the tone early in doubles action, where No. 2 pair Johnson and Quiroz and No. 35 pair Nguyen and Sarmiento both dispatched their opponents to the tune of 8-4 to give the Trojans a quick 1-0 advantage.
USC’s first singles point of the day came from No. 1 senior Steve Johnson, who defeated No. 33 Alexis Klegou 6-2, 6-1 for his 62nd consecutive singles win.
No. 25 sophomore Ray Sarmiento then extended USC’s lead to 3-0 with a 6-1, 6-4 finish over Junior Ore.
Quiroz clinched the win five minutes later, suspending the matches featuring No. 21 senior Daniel Nguyen, No. 51 freshman Yannick Hanfmann and No. 57 sophomore Emilio Gomez.
The win over Texas A&M was Johnson and Nguyen’s last match at Marks Stadium. The two graduating seniors were both a part of the Trojans’ last three consecutive championship teams.
“It’s always great to play at home, but it’s special for the seniors,” Sarmiento said. “I’m happy we got the wins for them.”
The Trojans saw similar success in the tournament opener the day before in their sweep over Fairfield, which was capped off by Hanfmann’s 6-2, 6-2 win over Dennis Zlobinsky.
After USC’s ranked pairs captured the doubles point in just 35 minutes, Johnson and Sarmiento defeated their opponents in straight singles sets to set up Hanfmann’s win.
“I feel like the team is playing well. It’s a great way to go into the tournament,” Nguyen said.
The first-round victory came nearly two weeks after the Trojans defeated No. 5 UCLA 4-2 at Ojai, Calif., on April 29 for the inaugural Pac-12 Team Championship.
The Bruins had snapped the Trojans’ 45-match winning streak in a tight 4-3 win in the regular season finale at Marks Stadium on April 20.
With a new four-match win streak intact, the Trojans continue their quest for a fourth consecutive NCAA title at the University of Georgia, where they will face No. 16 Illinois (19-7) in the round of 16 on Friday at 6 a.m.
The Fighting Illini are led by No. 7 Dennis Nevolo and No. 31 Roy Kalmanovich, who also comprise the No. 21 doubles pair for Illinois.
“It’ll definitely be tough,” Sarmiento said. “Illinois is proven, so we have to be ready to play and battle.”
 
If the Trojans advance, they will take on either No. 8 Duke or Baylor in the quarterfinals on Sunday.
 
USC ultimately hopes to play for its 20th national title in the championship match, which will take place on Tuesday at 5 p.m. EST.

The band name Bloody Knives carries the weight of a heavy metal, hardcore punk band’s alias.
But the title is deceiving: Artistically choosing to put aside the stereotypical sound of a screamo band, Bloody Knives delivers a surprisingly psychedelic sound instead of the heavy-metal bloodbath a listener would expect.
Think distorted guitars, ambient effects, static noise and soft vocal crescendos.
The shoegaze band’s first full-length album Blood is anything but nonconfrontational.
The band brings forth an onslaught of synths and instruments; the former contributes bass, vocals, guitar and keys, and the latter bangs on drums, crafts ambient noise and programs tracks. With so many sounds, it is easy to get lost in Blood’s tracks.
The album opens with “Lesson,” a song in which the first 15 seconds radiates visceral and aggressive music — drums pounding, guitar riffs distorting and eerie synths creeping.
But instead of erupting into a massive hardcore vocal attack in the first verse, the melodic vocals emerge subtly, gliding beneath the chaos of the in-your-face production.
With the opening track, Bloody Knives’ intensely unique sound begins to unravel and take form. The mix of heavy instrumentation, noise and synthesizers bring to mind noise-pop band Sleigh Bells’ quirky anthemic tunes — but Bloody Knives has more to prove.
A notch down from heavy metal, Blood retains the savagely aggressive stylings of metal music but transposes the screaming vocals of metal with ambient noise.
In essence, the music is very much an auditory bombardment — abstract and intriguing, yet violent and malicious.
This is the kind of music that could serve as a score to Patrick Bateman’s mind a la American Psycho or the thoughts of Kevin Bacon’s John Doe in Se7en.
Though the massive sounds of Blood play an important role in the way the album delivers itself to the listener, the softer tones of Bloody Knives’ production makes the band’s heavy synth-rock palatable.
Take the vocals on “Undecided,” arguably one of the strongest cuts off of the record.
Though static noise and forceful riffs create the undertone of the track, the transcendent electric guitar feedback and Maddox’s airy vocals brilliantly juxtapose saccharine reveries against gruesome nightmares.
There’s an interesting mix here, paralleling Alexis Krauss’ vocal stylings on almost every Sleigh Bells track. But Maddox’s voice sounds solemn and creepy where Krauss exudes energy and pep.
Take Bloody Knives as the doped out cousin of Sleigh Bells’ pristinely calculated tunes.
The album’s strongest points come from its moments of unexpected beauty when Maddox and McCown step outside of the box to tell stories through disjointed sounds.
But Blood often comes down hard and the carnal music can be hard to swallow.
Tracks such as “Not Now” and “Death Blessing” let the band’s vision run out of control.
The production manifests insanity and the tracks can be troubling to listen to — not in the disturbing, introspective feeling the guys were presumably going for, but in a mess of clipping tracks and ear-shattering bedlam.
In fact, the album as a whole sits so full of commotion and, at times, pretentiousness that it can be impossible to listen to Blood all the way through without incurring a massive static-induced headache.
This musical ruckus isn’t  inherently bad, per se, but it’s not going to get the trio anywhere any time soon.
Though it may not be artistically appetizing for an indie band like Bloody Knives, the duo should draw inspiration from similar acts such as Sleigh Bells and craft an even balance of noise and pop that is actually possible to market.
Blood is certainly not commercial, and the sounds of “Lessons” and “Death Blessing” are so powerful and intimidating that the band will have a hard time attracting fans who are not willing to take a second listen.
It’s a shame considering the fact that once the intitial shock of the music fades away, listeners can finally connect with the album.
In the end, Blood can be criticized for its technical faults and the sometimes mismatched marriage of noise and melody, but this whirlwind of noise is over before you know it.
And at only 28 minutes long, Blood surely captures the attention of anyone who’s interested in the subtleties of production and experimental auditory experiences.

For L.A. indie-rock quintet Vanaprasta, numbers are everything.
Numbers, as guitarist and vocalist Collin Desha explained, “just sort of wrapped everything together.”
In one instance, as the band’s members drove up to Portland to begin work on their first album, the group found itself with nine people, three in each car.

As the band finished work on what would turn out to be Healthy Geometry, a friend got into a life-threatening bike accident and was told he would never walk again.
Three months later, he walked out of the hospital.
“We didn’t really plan this out,” Desha said with a laugh. “For us, it was all about finding these patterns in life.”
These coincidences — or what some might call small instances of fate — didn’t end there.
The unusual band name popped into Desha’s head as he was listening to a speech by philosopher Alan Watts.
“[Watts] was describing what vanaprasta meant to him,” Desha said. “It’s all about the past and the present coming together to influence the future.”
Feeling inspired by the positive message, the band chose the Hindi word as its name. But they didn’t realize that vanaprasta also means forest-dweller — a strange coincidence, considering that the band recorded the first draft of its album in an Oregon forest.
Healthy Geometry, released last November, exemplifies an elegant hodgepodge of serene rock with songs like “Nineequalsnine” and “Supernumerary.”
“Nineequalsnine” is one of the more personal tracks on the album, written after their friend’s accident.
“We were a song short [on the album]; there were others but they weren’t album quality,” Desha said. “So we decided to go into a space and make a song without using any of the conventional things that we typically go through. ‘Nineequalsnine’ was jammed together in a rehearsal room.”
The production of the track “Nineequalsnine” is definitive of what Vanaprasta is all about: intimacy, connection and the need to create.
“We’re just trying to soak in as many influences as possible,” Desha said. “We’ve never really sought out all the big money; we just want to experiment with different sounds.”
The band’s refreshing choice to focus on the music instead of the superfluous, materialistic goods that a successful music career might bring sets the band a part from the rest.
Vanaprasta revels in its independence, a result of its refusal to accept a record deal until it’s the right one.
“We’re definitely really proud of the fact that we’ve done this all independently,” Desha said. “There are people who have come to us and offered us things, but it didn’t feel right.”
Desha also works at Interscope Records, which he said provides some insight into the crazy world of music production.
“We’ll know when it’s right, and we’re in no rush,” Desha said. “I’m not saying we’re not looking at opportunities; we’re trying to take the path of being independent and building our grassroots.”
Vanaprasta’s attention to touring has led to a strong music-based foundation, one in which its sound can continue to be molded and transformed without the pressures of a record company.
“We like that people will be coming to see us,” Desha said. “They’re coming for the music and not anything else. Vanaprasta was an interesting thing because it’s all about our live shows. We played 200 shows before we even put out a record.”
Vanaprasta will continue to tour throughout 2012, stopping in the Midwest, multiple cities in Texas and a few festivals before attempting to put together its second album.
“The first album is capturing the live experiences,” Desha said. “The next album we want to hone in on the new sound and push ourselves to another level.”
 
Vanaprasta performs at The Echo Friday.

In a nutshell, Tim Burton’s cinematic style could be described as dark, eccentric and humorous.
Anyone familiar with Burton’s previous work, including Corpse Bride and Alice in Wonderland, can attest to Burton’s unique aesthetic.  But his latest film Dark Shadows fails to capture the quirky edginess and grim humor of Burton’s previous dark comedies like Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas.
Family matters · Several Hollywood stars, such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, join forces to bring Tim Burton’s adaptation of the dark 1960s television program Dark Shadows to the big screen. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
Dark Shadows, based on the original 1960s television program, follows Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), a wealthy entrepreneur working in the mid-1700s who breaks the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). It turns out Angelique is a witch who seeks vengeance by destroying all that Barnabas loves, turning him into a vampire and locking him in a coffin for a couple hundred years. When Barnabas is finally discovered in 1972, all bets are off as he seeks to reclaim the honor of the Collins family, rediscover love and confront Angelique, all while adjusting to modern life.
In theory, Dark Shadows sounds like a promising tale of romance and revenge, but the film falters in its execution.
The biggest issue is that the film favors camp and style over the development of the narrative and characters. From the trailer alone, you can tell that Burton is going to deliver his signature quirky-meets-dark style, as indicated by a hyper-aggressive sex scene set to cheesy ’70s music, with Barnabas and Angelique literally flying off the walls and tearing the room apart in their fit of passion.
This unique combination of revenge and heavy stylization works, however,  to create an intriguing fantasy world. Dark Shadows wows audiences with its stark contrast of the rich and colorful ’70s against the cold and isolated life of a vampire.
And these disparities bring out the humor in the film: Barnabas speaks in outdated old English and sees a lava lamp as an “urn of blood,” refers to a road as “uncertain terrain” and considers a woman to be attractive based on her “birthing hips.”
Though these disparities bring a certain comedic flair to the film, Dark Shadows is overridden with the same tired jokes of Barnabas’ adjustment to the ’70s.  This thematic dominance restricts the narrative to a one-dimensional representation of Barnabas’ unfamiliarity with the modern world when the film could have explored larger themes such as family honor and true love in further detail.
This thematic favoritism (and thereby Depp favoritism) is a terrible loss, as Dark Shadows features rich characters and a cast dripping with talent: the strong but secretive head of the household (Michelle Pfeiffer), the blunt psychiatrist with just as many problems as her patients (Helena Bonham Carter) and the rebellious teenager who pushes as many buttons as possible (Chloë Grace Moretz).
The worst negligence of all, however, comes in the form of newcomer Bella Heathcote, who plays Barnabas’ love interest Victoria Winters. Between her innocent doe-eyed expressions and suspicious behavior, the governess of Collinwood Manner, Victoria, immediately draws attention, yet she is ignored for the majority of the film.
Barnabas makes his feelings clear for the audience, but there is little on-screen development of his relationship with Victoria, so when — spoiler alert — Victoria gives up her mortality to be with the undead Barnabas, the audience can’t help but feel it’s for a man she hardly knows.
It is as if the filmmakers did not have enough confidence in the love story, so they instead relied on Depp’s comedic talents and the overall campy style to save Dark Shadows from the critical underworld.
Depp is a charismatic actor whose talents should be put to good use, and the campiness gives the film a unique flair. In continuously exploiting his star and style, however, Burton has given the audience something that now feels hackneyed and overdone.
Dark Shadows had a beloved ’60s television program to work with, but instead of adding onto the legacy, the film weighs down a classic idea with an excessive use of dark humor and the cheese factor.
This is not to say that Burton needs to change his style, but Dark Shadows could use a little revamping and greater attention to the storyline. Audiences need something fresh and exciting, not the same old gothic characters they’ve received time and again; they need a step outside of the box and a complex narrative full of interesting characters.
Next time,  Burton should consider the basics before he begins flamboyantly accessorizing.
Exacly my sentiments. They could have chosen to stay true to the spirit of the show, and would have ended up with a scary, gothic thriller if they had – brimming with robust characters and supernatural creatures just like the show. And to the people who say the comedic option was OK, I say ‘why do it in the first place if you don’t stay true to the source’?? They blew it, and the box office confirms it.

Never has an American president openly supported gay marriage — that is, until President Barack Obama declared his monumental stance last week.
Much of our progressive generation has celebrated Obama’s personal support of the issue, even taking his stance as the beginning of the end of discrimination against gay Americans.  This is true to some extent, as Obama’s unprecedented stance stands as an overdue milestone in the battle for equal rights.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan 
The fact of the matter is that same-sex marriage is a complex issue that touches on state v.s federal rights and the history of religion in this country.  These complexities mean that there isn’t one simple solution to the problem, and Obama’s support of gay marriage is not something to get excited about yet, as no political effort has followed suit.
It’s also worth noting that Obama had previously opposed same-sex marriage.
When Obama ran for the U.S. Senate eight years ago, he told WTTW Chicago public television, “What I believe in my faith is that a man and a woman, when they get married, are performing something before God.”
These mixed signals engender questions as to how much trust citizens can put into Obama’s new claim. In fact, people should have reservations regarding this new stance, no matter how good the news is.
The faith we can put into a politician’s changes of opinion, along with the timing of the upcoming election, complicate the issue.
A recent poll by CBS News/The New York Times noted that 25 percent of voters said they likely will not support Obama in the upcoming election because of his newfound support of gay marriage.
Obama’s revolutionary words are meant to inspire the hope and change that he initially promised when he ran for president in 2008, but his direct contradiction of his former beliefs demonstrates a disconcerting lack of continuity.
And though Obama’s actions might be considered a strong step in the right direction, the timing of this fight for justice seems like an advance of his own political strategy.
Even if Obama’s intentions are genuine, all he has offered thus far is an opinion and not a plan of action.  Many supporters of same-sex marriage are treating Obama’s words as if they have brought an end to the battle for equal rights, when in fact this is just the beginning.  Until Obama pushes for new legislation, there really is nothing to celebrate. Considering Obama has noted that gay rights will not be a focus for his campaign, it seems that for now we just have a slight hope for equality, not actual change.
As U.S. citizens, the gay community is just as entitled to the same rights, including marriage, as anyone else.  And though laws regarding same-sex marriage are subject to state, rather than federal decisions, Obama still carries significant influence across the country and should take action accordingly.
Many supporters of gay rights would love to back Obama and his new stance, but talk is cheap. Until Obama makes a stronger effort to ensure equality for the gay community, his newfound support of same-sex marriage could be nothing more than a mask for his election agenda.

I disagree that same-sex supporters are viewing this as the end of the fight. The reason it was so celebrated was because it was a huge step in the right direction. However, as we all saw from the North Carolina amendment, the fight is far from over. 
I guess I don’t really understand why people are so fired up about Obama’s support of gay marriage being a political thing. Was it a political tool? Of course it was! He’s not stupid. This is an election year. Coming out and saying officially that he supports gay marriage will no doubt sway some voters towards his side. But was it purely to sway those voters and then he will suddenly not be in favor of gay marriage if he wins a second term? I really don’t think so. While Obama was originally against gay marriage, he has been in favor of domestic partnerships and that  LGBT folks are treated equally under the law. He has said numerous times that his own personal stance on gay marriage has been changing. After repealing DADT, it was clear he was headed in this direction. 
So, so what if he uses it as a campaigning tool? If it’s a step in the right direction and he sticks to it (which it sure looks like he will), who cares?
I think that the issue starts with homosexuality. It is not natural. It is even found in nature among animals. I have heard of that story about the penguins, but how do they know they are behaving in a homosexual way? The point is that those who are homosexual should go back to being the way they were born.
You do realize you contradicted yourself when you said “It is not natural. It is even found in nature among animals,” right?
The philosophical problem that plagues this nation is the misunderstanding  and confusion of the concept of marriage, which is actually two ideological entities: religious marriage and legal marriage.
Religious marriage is the religious institution defined by religions, in the eyes of whatever god/gods are being invoked. There is nothing legal about religious marriage; it is the ceremony and pomp in the church.
Legal marriage is the legal granting of rights and privileges to couples, to promote a monogamous lifestyle, nominally in the best interest of the nation. It is the signing of the marriage license in front of witnesses.
“Gay” or “same-sex” marriage is the latter, the push for the rights and recognition, not the religious approval of some deity.
Obama is doing, as Jay-Z recently noted, “what is right” by acknowledging that we should no longer deny the same rights to gay couples that we afford to straight couples.
And so what if his religious views are against gay marriage? A president is supposed to do what is politically right for the nation, regardless of his/her personal beliefs; that’s the separation of church and state.
Good luck finding anyone else running who is willing to make decisions for the country based on the nation’s best interests, rather than on religious grounds. That’s the ultimate issue in this upcoming election.
Even before Obama “came out” in support of gay marriage, he supported the repeal of DOMA, the single biggest obstacle keeping legally married same-sex couples from enjoying the same federal benefits as their straight counterparts.  He has also openly and publicly opposed state referenda that ban gay marriage, including Prop 8 in California in 2008.  So let’s give credit where credit is due.  Obama has done more for gay rights than any other President before him, and will continue to do more than any other viable alternative.  We should continue to fight for more, but let’s not forget how far we’ve come.
Although Obama’s stance will not change any policies in favor of same sex marriage; his commentary is symbolic as the first sitting President to voice acceptance for same sex marriage.  Imagine that young person in the midwest who feels he is the only gay kid that exists, he’s being bullied at school and fears his parents will disown him. This gay youth hears that the President of the United States validates his identity. This simple gesture of support by the President may save this young person from taking his own life and hopefully empower him to become the person he wants to become regardless of his sexuality. This President will not only be a historic figure based on his ethnicity/race, but also as being the first President to support marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples.  As history looks back, Obama will be viewed very favorable, Abe Lincoln like, as supporting equality for all.
As much as we would love to have ” all things equal”, gay marriage is not an equality that they should have.  The LBGT comm should have full and complete domestic partner rights, and enjoy everything that a warm, loving couple can have, but to include marriage in the conversation is not appropriate.  No other country supports gay marriage.  No religion supports gay marriage.   To support this “equality” mantra, what if I wanted to marry my sister, or have many wives?  Why can’t I have the right to do so?  Why can’t I have the right to do anything I want to do, as long as it doesn’t affext you?  It’s because we are a population of societies that have rules to follow.  It’s true.  Not everyone is equal and it shouldn’t be that way.  If I work hard for my money, and you don’t care to work for a living, but instead you want to live off of a gov entitlement program, why then should my salary be taxed at a higher ratue just because you don’t want to work?   Same kind of idea.  Whether you believe that gay people are born that way, which in some cases I beleive they are, or their gayness is the result of parenting, society, or what….  You have rights as a person to live freebut to step on the sanctity of marriage is not appropriate at this time.
Obama is only using the gay rits movement as a pawn in nhis attempt to deflect the political race conversation away from his poor performance as a President and a leader of the free world.  How can you trust a man you do not know anyting about?  
I think that gay marriage is in the future, but it’s a state’s right to determine that, not a Federal mantra.
Actually, gay marriage is legal in 10 countries: South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with several more about to join the ranks.  So it seems to me there are many other countries that support gay marriage.
Last time I checked, the United States set of rules is the U.S. Constitution, not the Bible. No where in the Constitution does it talk about marriage being between one man and one woman. So there really isn’t a “sanctity of marriage” rule that a United States citizen is required to follow.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  On this, Obama has taken that step.  To expect to have the journey completed with that step is unrealistic.
As an advocate for gay rights I have been fairly pleased with his actions to date.  Could they have been done sooner?  SInce most require the cooperation of Congress, probably not.  Would I have wanted action sooner?  Absolutely, but recognizing legislative obsitcles are often difficult to overcome, moderates any disappointment I have.

Summer has finally arrived, which means three months of great weather and plenty of exciting things to do, whether it’s in Los Angeles or back home. What better way to decompress after nine hard months of school life?
But for many students, the season isn’t a time to simply kick back. Especially for upperclassmen, the onset of summer break signals the coming of something much more stressful: Internships and jobs.
With ever-more competitive job markets making life difficult for college graduates, the importance of summer work has grown — but robbing yourself of time off isn’t the answer.
It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of trying to prove yourself through summer jobs and internships.  This isn’t a bad thing — working hard at a job is definitely preferable to loafing around in pajamas and eating Cheetos while watching Breaking Bad, no matter how pleasant the latter might sound.
But forgetting to use the summer to mentally decompress can have downfalls of its own, too, and new research from USC suggests that not taking the time to breathe and reflect can have tangible effects on the way we grow.
“Rest Is Not Idleness,” co-authored by USC assistant professor Mary Helen Immordino-Yang and published by the scientific journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, examines the neurobiology of the brain at “default mode,” or basically in rest. Not having enough time to rest your mind and “look inward” for reflection can, according to the research, be a roadblock to sustaining moral development, emotional analysis and mental well-being, as well as exacerbate anxiety and negatively impact motivation.
“We focus on the outside world in education and don’t look much at inwardly focused reflective skills and attentions, but inward focus impacts the way we build memories, make meaning and transfer that learning into new contexts,” Immordino-Yang said to USC News.
So what does this really mean? Immordino-Yang notes that rest and inward thinking doesn’t just mean chilling on the Internet. Instead, true benefits come from taking the time for genuine introspection and letting your mind wander naturally: Think more Zen Master than couch potato.
“Consistently imposing overly high-attention demands on children, either in school, through entertainment or through living conditions, may rob them of opportunities to advance from thinking about ‘what happened’ or ‘how to do this’ to constructing knowledge about ‘what this means for the world and for the way I live my life,’” Immordino-Yang said.
Though she references children, the point still applies to college students — especially ones in high-stress, practical performance-based environments.
Daydreaming and abstract reflection might not have any place in the office, but giving yourself the time to do so, whether it’s at the beach or in bed, plays a critical part in personal and mental growth.
More than anything, it’s important to keep in mind that work isn’t everything — even when the pressure to get a good job might deem it so.
