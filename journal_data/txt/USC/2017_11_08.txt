USC students and staff members gathered in Wallis Annenberg Hall to view and analyze the results of the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races on Tuesday evening. The race took place one year after the 2016 presidential election and could foreshadow political trends going into the 2018 midterm elections.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy hosted the viewing and invited notable guest speakers for a panel discussion. 
Along with Robert Shrum, director of the Unruh Institute; Eileen McMenamin, former communications director for Sen. John McCain; and Bill Burton, former deputy White House press secretary during the Obama administration, were present to discuss the election results and the possible ways they could affect the United States’ political climate. 
“This is a critical election because it’s the first referendum that we’ve seen on the Republican Party since Donald Trump became president,” Shrum said. “It’s clear that he’s hurting the Republican candidates up and down the ballot. This election is a harbinger of what’s going to happen in the midterm this next year, unless Donald Trump changes his course.” 
McMenamin began by explaining how the party that’s out of the White House usually wins the gubernatorial races. Democratic candidate Ralph Northam’s victory, based on the numbers and statistics coming out of Virginia, was expected, McMenamin said.
“You can be a Republican who can critique your own party and not suffer,” McMenamin said. “I think that example could give some hope to Republicans who have been flashing themselves to the president and they’ll feel a bit more comfortable standing up for what they really believe in without being afraid that they’re going to face some sort of consequences.” 
Based on the results, McMenamin and Burton both spoke on the lessons that each party should take from this evening, as they look forward to future elections.
“If Democrats watch closely to what Ralph Northam did to win, it wasn’t just engaging with this unpopular president,” Burton said. 
Burton believes voters care about the issues that will affect their future, more than opposing Trump.
According to Burton, this politicial era is unlike any other, because Republican politicans share a wide array of opinions on different issues. 
“As for Republicans, I think that this is a really exciting time to a be a Republican in California because the party is so adrift,” Burton said. “There are very little candidates here and the message has been tied up in a base that does really like Donald Trump in some ways.” 
Burton noted there is currently more of a populist versus establishment view on politics, but the appeal to voters is still on “getting things done.” 
At the end of the discussion, Burton and McMenamin shared their thoughts on how the candidates’ different views on immigration policies and taxes were major determinants of how the election would end. 
“It’s important for you college students to be politically aware because it’s your lives and your futures that are on the line,” Shrum said. “You can be a Republican or a Democrat, but you have to answer those questions and you need to be engaged and involved because it’s your life that’s on the line.”

The virtual reality venture, titled “Heterotopias,” is School of Cinematic Arts graduate students Noa Kaplan and Szilvia Ruszev’s first project utilizing this type of technology. Photo from Noa Kaplan’s website.
With the growth of virtual reality technology, many students are exploring innovative ways to incorporate the technology into artistic and media-related projects. Two students from the School of Cinematic Arts’ media arts and practice program have integrated a virtual reality world in an immersive work, titled “Heterotopias.”
Created by graduate students Noa Kaplan and Szilvia Ruszev, Heterotopias is a virtual reality essay that allows viewers to interact with everyday spaces differently. Set in common areas such as a garden or a cemetery, the project looks to change the way people view their own behavior when responding to their surroundings. 
According to Kaplan and Ruszev, the project was inspired by a 1967 lecture given by French philosopher Michel Foucault. The lecture, titled “Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias,” focused on places that people inhabit both physically and mentally. One example he mentioned was mirrors. Foucault questioned the rules that govern people’s behavior in different spaces, the students said, and explored the connection between location and people’s actions. 
Kaplan and Ruszev wanted to further delve into the ideas touched on in Foucault’s lecture, and received a grant from the Jaunt Cinematic VR Fellowship to fund their work. 
“None of us had ever done anything like this,” Ruszev said. “On every level, we had to adjust ourselves.” 
Ruszev’s background is in film editing, while Kaplan’s focus is on sculpture, humanities and media design. “Heterotopias” marks the pair’s first project utilizing virtual reality.
“We wanted to take a more critical approach and really look at why people are so excited about this technology,” Kaplan said. “That’s why we decided to go at it as a research process and a virtual reality essay, instead of talking about it as an immersive experience or something more glamorous.”
The project includes shots from many locations around Los Angeles, with some spots taking inspiration from those mentioned in Foucault’s lecture. 
“We went all around L.A., to busy freeway intersections and mausoleums and gardens and other places, and captured the city with a virtual reality stereo 360 [degree] camera,” Kaplan said. “We were getting lessons in the very bureaucratic details of how space is divided and governed, which is very much in line with what the essay and the lecture talk about.”
Kaplan and Ruszev are working to complete the project, which will consist of a series of spaces that viewers can explore. Each space includes sub-spaces that are activated based on movements of the viewer’s eyes. To achieve this effort, viewers must wear an eye-tracking headset so that they are transported to a new place when they blink.
In addition to the headset, viewers will also sit in a suspension chair in order to give them the sensation of floating. A prototype of the chair has been finished, and a custom version is in the works.
Parts of “Heterotopia” have already been presented at various conferences such as the annual Media Arts and Practice Undergraduate Exhibition and the Contagion Graduate Conference, and from their presentations, the project has generated a positive reaction.
Kaplan and Ruszev say they hope that “Heterotopia” will make people question the way they conduct themselves in different spaces and locations. 
“It’s … very nonlinear and non-narrative, so there’s no plot or goal in terms of a game,” Kaplan said. “It’s more about experiencing different spaces and being aware of how your body behaves and feels when you’re in a series of virtual spaces.”

Ivana Giang and Cindy Pineda, co-chief diversity officers of the Undergraduate Student Government, are organizing a town hall Friday for students to offer their opinions regarding the efficacy of current cultural spaces on campus.
“This has been a conversation within USG for the last several years,” Giang said at Tuesday’s USG Senate meeting. “I’ve been in USG since my freshman year … which was when campus climate happened.”
Giang explained campus climate was a list of demands made by a coalition of student groups regarding creating a more inclusive campus for marginalized groups.
“We wanted to open this up to students who aren’t affiliated with USG to tell us what cultural spaces and resources they want to see here,” Giang said. 
Pineda and Giang are due to report to Provost Michael Quick in December regarding cultural spaces. Giang and Pineda said the town hall is meant to allow diversity officials to more accurately represent their constituencies and their views on actions taken thus far. 
The town hall will be held Friday from 1 to 3 p.m. in the basement of the United University Church. The town hall aims to offer an opportunity for students outside USG to give their perspectives regarding the efficacy of the currently existing cultural spaces on campus.
Karen García, the executive director of Latinx Student Assembly, has been a vocal advocate for inclusivity and increased support for diversity at USC.
“Especially with the growing diversity that USC likes to promote, there will be more need for space for these communities,” García said. “International students are a group that should have their own space, considering how large the population is at USC.”
This initiative, according to Giang, is within the jurisdiction of Student Affairs, which released a five-year plan in 2015 with goals regarding the empowerment of students. One of the goals on the Student Affairs website specifically mentions diversity, stating that it aims to “educate students to advocate for themselves and others, develop and broaden their knowledge of diversity and be agents of change.”
Giang noted these goals, and said that the meeting on Friday is intended to be in the spirit of this goal in particular. 
“It’s a big conversation and it’s a big movement and progress is slow, but I think the biggest takeaway is that this report is a huge step towards having these voices heard that haven’t been listened to in the past,” Giang said.
García said she hopes for higher accountability and action regarding the cultural spaces, specifically mentioning that El Centro Chicano’s space is overcrowded.
“There are a lot of communities that are not being represented in cultural centers,” García said. “A lot of students are being overlooked and are falling through the cracks. Simply advertising diversity isn’t enough without actually catering to students who need resources and come here expecting those resources.”
The USG Senate also voted unanimously on Tuesday in favor of election reforms that aim to increase the wellness and overall election experience of the candidates, and increase transparency in the election process.

As the Trojans began another week of practice in preparation for Colorado, the team received positive news in the latest College Football Playoff Rankings, which were announced midway through Tuesday’s practice. 
USC reacts to rankings jump 
In the first edition of the CFP Rankings, which were released last week, the Trojans came in ranked at No. 17. After a wild week of college football in which four top 15 teams suffered defeats, USC rose dramatically to No. 11, ahead of Ohio State, Penn State and Oklahoma State. 
“I’m not surprised, I feel like we should be there,” junior running back Ronald Jones II said after finding out about the new ranking. “I didn’t know that we jumped that far, but that’s what’s up. I like that.” 
The Trojans appeared to be eliminated from playoff consideration when they were crushed by 35 points at the hands of Notre Dame, but now after consecutive wins over Arizona State and Arizona, there seems to be at least a small chance. 
“We do have that hope,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold said. “But at the same time we’re focused on taking it one week at a time, because if we beat Colorado then we control our own destiny. If we beat UCLA, if we just continue to win games, that’s really all that matters.” 
It was the second-highest increase in rankings among teams ranked in the CFP Top 25. Michigan State moved up 12 spots to No. 12 after upsetting Penn State on Saturday. Only No. 10 Auburn came in as a higher ranked two-loss team, while No. 9 Washington continues to be the highest-ranked Pac-12 program. 
“It’s still so early in November,” head coach Clay Helton said. “There are so many games still to be played and decisions to be made. It’s nice to be thought of that way. We still have the opportunity to not only play Colorado but also have another game next week and hopefully have another one after that with the Pac-12 Championship.”
Injury Update 
On Tuesday, several key contributors including junior tight end Tyler Petite (shoulder), senior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu (ankle) and freshman placekicker Chase McGrath (groin) were held out of practice with minor injuries. All are listed as day-to-day. 
Meanwhile, redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector (broken hand), junior cornerback Iman Marshall (knee) and redshirt freshman running back Vavae Malepaei (knee) all returned to practice in limited capacities. Helton thinks both Marshall and Malepaei, who suffered similar injuries, could be ready in time for Colorado. 
“I think both of them showed good signs,” Helton said. “It’s early in the week. We held both last week, being protective, and both of them got live work today, which was good to see.” 
Scouting Colorado
Colorado has regressed significantly from last year’s surprising 10-win season, but the Buffaloes still have bring an elite ground attack to the table behind running back Phillip Lindsay. The high-volume, powerful back has the most carries in the FBS (263) and the fourth-most rushing yards (1,334). 
“Lindsay jumps out all over the tape,” Helton said. “His ability to be a very durable back, he can touch the ball 30 times, he actually carried it 40 times in one game. Just a very durable back that comes out of the backfield and can be very explosive. I remember him catching a pass against us down the sideline last year on a wheel route.”
Helton sees Colorado as a dangerous opponent with plenty to prove this weekend, despite entering as a heavy underdog. 
“You really see a team that’s playing good football but has lost some very close games,” Helton said. “They’re fighting for bowl eligibility, so we know we’re going to get their best.”

The No. 9 women’s soccer team will play Eastern Washington (14-3-1) in the first round of the NCAA playoffs in a rematch on Saturday at McAlister Field.
The Eagles — the champions of the Big Sky conference — had a successful season this year, finishing as the Big Sky regular season champions, besting their closest competitor by 7 points and winning the conference postseason championship, defeating Northern Colorado 3-0 in the final.
Eastern Washington is led on offense by senior forward Chloe Williams (11 goals and eight assists) and junior midfielder Jenny Chavez (8 goals), with both starting every game this season. 
But entire team is prolific in the final third of the field. This season, the Eagles have accumulated 47 goals or 2.14 per game. They are also outperforming their opponents by a margin of just over 2-1 in both shots and shots on target.  In addition to these statistics, Eastern Washington are constantly finding space to take shots, with the team averaging 17.5 per game. 
It is not only the offense that has been strong this season, but the defense as well has been stout for Eastern Washington. The Eagles’ backline is led by senior defender M’Kenna Hayes, who has started every game she has appeared in this season, and junior defender Megan Spataro. The Eastern Washington defense has held its opponents to 24 goals this season, or 1.09 per game and 8.4 shots per game.  In comparison, the USC defense has held its opponents to 9.1 shots per game and 0.83 goals per game. 
This first round matchup will be a rematch of the Trojans’ first-round matchup last year, a game that the Trojans won comfortably 3-1, outshooting the Eagles 35-8 (17-4 on target), forcing the Eastern Washington goalkeeper into making 13 saves. This game also saw senior midfielder Nicole Molen score her fifth goal of the season on a header. 
Although prior history would suggest that this game would be smooth sailing for the Trojans, head coach Keidane McAlpine did not share that same sentiment.
“Obviously there is a little confidence, but at the same time it’s got to be reserved,” McAlpine said. “Because every year is a little different, we’re a lot different, they are going to be different. The experience that they gained last year should pay dividends for them to be able to take the trip and know where they are staying and all the routine of coming down here to play.”
Senior forward Sydney Johnson echoed the idea, warning about being overconfident coming into the game. 
“[Eastern Washington is] going to come out with a lot of energy,” Johnson said. “Every team is coming at us especially since we’re defending champs.”
With a win this weekend, the Trojans will start strong in their defense of their national championship title. If the Trojans win this weekend, they will most likely host Rice or Baylor on either Nov. 17 or 19.
