During the latter days of training camp, Ed Orgeron stood near the corner of Howard Jones Field, arms crossed and carrying a slight grin. He knew the answer to the question, but he cared not to say, really, or even elaborate much.
“You’re sandbagging a little, aren’t you?” a reporter asked. “You guys are better than anybody realizes.”
Pleasant surprise · Ed Orgeron has seamlessly replaced three of last season’s four defensive line starters and caught new recruits up to speed. – Daily Trojan file photo
He responded, bellowing: “We’re staying hungry, just staying hungry.”
It hardly meant much, of course.
And when again asked about USC’s untested but developing defensive line, he offered a familiar response: “staying hungry.”
Call it his patented way of filibustering. The Trojans’ poker-faced defensive coordinator was keeping his cards particularly close to his chest that day. He didn’t want to boast — at least not publicly. There was no itch to grab a microphone and make any sort of sweeping declaration.
Maybe the unit, a subject of much preseason scrutiny because of questions surrounding its inexperience, would be OK after all. But Orgeron, who also serves as USC’s defensive line coach, saw no reason to spread the news up and down the Pacific Coast.
So instead he opted to keep grinning and nodding, repeating the same two words until eventually a new question and a new topic was presented.
But with roughly one-third of the season completed the secret — and it’s hardly much of one now — is out: USC’s defensive line is rather good.
In the team’s latest win, a 27-9 drubbing of California at the Coliseum last Saturday, USC recorded seven sacks against rattled quarterback Zach Maynard — the most in a game since posting the same total in a 2007 matchup against Oregon State. And on the season thus far, USC ranks third out of 124 Football Bowl Subdivision teams with 16 sacks, one behind the nation’s leaders, Tulsa and San Jose State.
So now we know what Orgeron knew in August. We know the defensive line is quick. We know it’s deeper than in the last couple seasons. We know it’s shouldering much of the load at the moment.
Oddly enough, in several respects, the defense line — once the question mark — might very well be the strength of the defense. Against the Golden Bears, it pressured Maynard by rushing just four down linemen, dropping everyone else into pass coverage. There was little need to blitz a linebacker, or a safety, or a cornerback, which certainly makes it easier for the secondary.
And that’s a bit of a surprise. For one, the Trojans had already lost two starters from a season ago in DaJohn Harris and Nick Perry, who each left for the NFL and now play for the Tennessee Titans and Green Bay Packers, respectively. Not to mention, returning senior defensive end Devon Kennard tore a pectoral muscle while weightlifting in late July.
In spite of this, USC’s gotten quite a bit of production from its newest players, junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, a transfer from Diablo Valley Junior College in Pleasant Hill, Calif., and freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams. The two combined for 5.5 sacks against Cal. And Breslin’s total, 3.5, marked the highest by a USC player since Lawrence Jackson recorded four sacks at Arizona State on Thanksgiving 2007.
So you’d think by now Orgeron would spill the news and maybe boast, at least a little. After all, his group is ahead of the curve and better than most anticipated, especially this early.
“They’ve performed well,” he said Saturday.
And then came the qualifier.
“But the competition is going to get stiffer. How they respond throughout the season will be important — a lot of ball is left.”
He does have a point, sure. There are at least eight games remaining on the schedule, and against Stanford — the team’s lone blemish thus far — the Trojans failed to sack quarterback Josh Nunes once. The pressure that propelled the Trojans against Cal a week later was sorely missing.
But still, you sense a sort of cautious optimism from a coach who’s witnessed quite a handful of the Trojans’ more decorated defensive line units in school history.
Comparisons are tough to make, but this group carries its fair share of upside.
“They’re getting better every time,” said Orgeron. “But we have to stay hungry. We have to work very hard, stay humble and pay attention to details. Because if not, we won’t play very well and we have to be at our best every game.”
Right now, he has them doing that.

USC  coach Lane Kiffin announced on Sunday’s weekly conference call that freshman linebacker Scott Starr and junior offensive lineman David Garness have suffered season-ending injuries.
After mostly playing on special teams to begin the season, Starr will apply for a medical redshirt because of recurring neck pains.
The NCAA only grants a medical redshirt if the player in question does not play in more than 30 percent of the team’s games. This shouldn’t be an issue for Starr, since he will have only competed in three of USC’s 12 scheduled games.
The freshman from Norco, Calif. was listed as sophomore Lamar Dawson’s backup at middle linebacker on the depth chart, but when Dawson missed the season opener against Hawai’i, sophomore Hayes Pullard assumed Dawson’s vacated spot and redshirt freshman Anthony Sarao moved into the starting lineup.
Garness, a junior college transfer in USC’s 2011 recruiting class, has yet to appear in a game at USC after redshirting last season. The Alaska native will undergo back surgery.
With these additional injuries, USC will, in all likelihood, play minus five scholarship players for the rest of the season. In addition to Starr and Garness, senior defensive end Devon Kennard (torn pectoral muscle), sophomore running back Tre Madden (torn ACL) and freshman defensive end DeVante Wilson (torn ACL) are all expected to miss 2012, although Kennard is holding out hope he can return late in the season.
In other injury news, Kiffin indicated that sophomore wide receiver George Farmer was not medically cleared to compete in last Saturday’s game against Cal, but declined to disclose the injury or its severity.
—
Though the 2012 season is barely a quarter of the way complete, USC is already busy finalizing future seasons’ schedules.
On Tuesday, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden announced that USC will play Fresno State on Aug. 29, 2014, in the Coliseum.
“We are excited to add Fresno State to our 2014 schedule,” Kiffin said in a statement. “It’s a quality in-state opponent with a traditionally strong program. The games between the teams in the past have been very competitive and have attracted lots of fans from both sides.”
Both matchups between USC and Fresno State have been notable. In 2005, No. 1 USC barely edged out upstart No. 16 Fresno State, 50-42.
Thirteen years prior to that classic showdown, an unranked Fresno State squad upset No. 23 USC, 24-7, in the 1992 Freedom Bowl in Anaheim, Calif.
Kiffin is intimately familiar with the Bulldogs’ program, as he was a backup quarterback for the university from 1994-96. In his senior season, he elected not to play and instead accepted a position as a student assistant coach for the team under coach Jeff Tedford, who is now at Cal.
The addition of Fresno State to the 2014 schedule now cements the Trojans’ out-of-conference slate. In addition to the annual rivalry game against Notre Dame, they will also play Boston College in a rematch of the 2009 Emerald Bowl, in which USC prevailed 24-13.

USC coach Lane Kiffin often structures his offensive game plan around giving wide receivers sophomore Marqise Lee and junior Robert Woods the ball in space and trusting they will more often than not elude tacklers and spring free for sizable gains.
Breakthrough · Even after struggling to net 26 rushing yards at Stanford on Sept. 15, USC coach Lane Kiffin did not shy away from running the ball against Cal. Silas Redd gained 158 yards, a season high. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Of course, opposing coaches are aware of this strategy, which is why USC is starting to encounter defensive schemes designed to blanket the two Biletnikoff Award candidates and force other Trojans to shoulder the offensive burden.
Last Saturday against California, senior Curtis McNeal and junior Silas Redd — a vaunted backfield duo entering 2012 — finally validated the many who expected USC’s offense to be more balanced between the run and the pass than it had been through the first three games.
“We’re seeing a change in defenses,” Kiffin said. “Almost every week that we play, we’re seeing a complete game plan about No. 9 [Lee] and No. 2 [Woods]. That’s one of the good things about throwing those guys the ball so much in the first couple of games: People do what they did today. They spend the whole week trying to take away those two guys, and that opens up your running game.”
Facing a Cal defense fixated on not allowing the deep ball, McNeal and Redd combined for 273 yards on 31 carries in the game for a hefty 8.8 yards-per-carry average. In fact, it was the first time since 2008 that two Trojans ran for at least 100 yards apiece in the same game.
“If defenses are going to stay back and play cover-two shell and force us to run, then we got to do it,” senior quarterback Matt Barkley said.
The cover-two defense Cal used — a version of which USC employs itself — is designed to prevent long pass completions. In its base form, the cover-two is a zone defense with no man-to-man coverage played from a four-three personnel set (four defensive linemen, three linebackers). Two safeties divide the field into two deep zones, starting from about 15 yards off the line of scrimmage. Four defensive linemen rush the quarterback, while the three linebackers and two cornerbacks generally separate the field in front of the safeties into five smaller zones.
Often facing only seven defenders in the middle of the field near the line of scrimmage — or in the “box” — last Saturday, USC sought to exploit the favorable running matchup at the expense of the more prolific passing numbers the Trojans usually amass.
Though the game wasn’t Barkley’s flashiest performance, the veteran recognizes there are multiple ways to score points.
“I don’t think we’re trying to win a certain way,” Barkley said about the shift in offensive approach. “I think we’re trying to score as many points as possible.”
Aside from the type of defense Cal employed, Kiffin also diagnosed some favorable personnel matchups on film and knew the ground attack would be buoyed by senior center Khaled Holmes’ return to the starting lineup.
“We thought we had some matchups that we liked [in the running game] up front,” Kiffin said. “Obviously, Khaled being back made a big difference for us — as you can see in the games he’s played versus the game he didn’t play — when it comes to running the ball and not giving up sacks.”
Holmes, who exited the game in the fourth quarter after apparently re-aggravating the ankle he injured in the Syracuse game on Sept. 8, shored up a maligned offensive line unit that contributed to a paltry 26 net rushing yards against the Cardinal two weeks ago. His only notable mistake was a holding penalty he took on the Golden Bears’ six-yard line that negated a McNeal touchdown scamper.
Still, USC strayed from its game plan and seemed hesitant to commit fully to the run at the beginning of the second half.
Even after a first half in which Trojan running backs combined for 166 yards on just 13 carries and really only faltered once when Redd couldn’t convert third-and-one and fourth-and-one opportunities on a first-quarter drive, USC began the second half with a three-and-out on three consecutive pass plays.
On the next series, Redd carried the ball on the first two plays for 20 combined yards as USC returned to the ground game. But McNeal fumbled on the Trojans’ 45-yard line in the series, and whether USC would revert back to a pass-heavy attack was in question.
Kiffin didn’t overreact, however, and continued to allow the duo to salt away the clock for the duration of the contest.
“The two backs ran hard right from the beginning,” Kiffin said. “We put the ball on the ground one time, but other than that [we played well].”
Redd, who averaged a mere 1.3 yards per carry against Stanford, was pleased with how the offensive line and running backs worked in tandem to bounce back from a dispiriting performance.
“[The offensive line and running backs] had their best week of practice,” Redd said of the week leading up the Cal game. “They came out firing and really hit [Cal] in the mouth right from the first snap. We didn’t let our foot off the pedal.”
Entering the bye week, USC’s offense can pull confidence from its showing against Cal, knowing that, no matter what kind of defensive schemes it encounters, it can adjust accordingly and score points using different players and plays.
“We all know we can throw the ball well if we want to and that we have the great skilled players in the receiving game to do that,” Kiffin said in his weekly Sunday conference call. “But it was more critical for this team to build confidence in the offensive line and running backs.”

Many USC football fans were disappointed Saturday, as stalled negotiations between Pac-12 Networks and DirecTV prevented Saturday’s football game against California was not broadcast on the satellite service provider.
Pac-12 Networks rejected two of DirecTV’s offers, making DirecTV the largest national provider that has not yet added the channels.
“This means Pac-12 fans who subscribe to DirecTV are in jeopardy of missing all 35 football games scheduled for broadcast on Pac-12 Networks, beginning Thursday night,” said Pac-12 Networks in an open letter to fans.
Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said Saturday that the network’s proposal is fair and should be acceptable since it is comparable to the deal reached with some of DirecTV’s competitors.
“We’ve offered them a similar deal to what DISH has done and what the cable operators have done so that’s why we know it is something they can do,” Scott said. “We also know it’s fair to other deals that they have.”
DirecTV is attempting to remedy the problem by either creating a stand-alone channel for willing subscribers or establishing a system in which viewers can purchase future games on demand.
In a statement released Friday, DirecTV said Pac-12 Networks was being uncooperative, claiming that the network had rejected its offers without consideration because Pac-12 Networks wants all DirecTV customers to pay for the channel regardless if they are football fans or not.
Steve Ross, a professor of history who specializes in the role of sports in popular culture, said he thinks that the viewers and fans are of little concern to the networks.
“Everybody’s being greedy, and the last people who are being taken into consideration are the fans,” Ross said. “Pac-12 is being incredibly greedy with this new contract, and greedy with the idea that they are going to sell the rights to the highest bidder no matter what.”
Ross also said the debacle could mean less support, less involvement and fewer donations from USC fans.
“If you lose 10 percent of your fan base, that’s 10 percent of sales, 10 percent of involvement in the program,” Ross said. “I believe that alumni donations go up during the years that the football program wins and people are paying attention.”
Max Susman, a junior majoring in electrical engineering, said he had to listen to Saturday’s game against Cal on the radio when he was unable to attend.
“When I found out I couldn’t find the game on USC’s cable service I was really upset,” Susman said. “I ended up listening to it on the radio. Isn’t this the 21st century?”
Some students said the standstill affected their families’ ability to keep up with the game.
“My parents made me give them play-by-play updates of what was going on in the Cal game since they couldn’t watch the game on TV,” said Mandy Raeder, a sophomore majoring in accounting.
Though the lack of agreement between Pac-12 Networks and DirecTV is causing a stir among fans, Professor Daniel Durbin, director of the Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media and Society, is anticipating a settlement soon.
“I really doubt that this will go too long-term,” Durbin said. “Eventually they are going to have to work something out. The Pac-12 has to be able to get onto DirecTV, and they are on the weaker side of the negotiations.”
Scott said fans should continue pressuring DirecTV to add Pac-12 Networks to their lineup.
“Unfortunately, the frustration of fans needs to keep being manifested to DirecTV and hopefully they listen better because they do pride themselves on catering to the sports broadcasts,” Scott said. “Right now, I feel like they are betraying that promise to consumers, at least our fans — USC fans in this case — so we hope that changes.”
 
Joey Kaufman contributed to this report.
“Scott said fans should continue pressuring DirecTV to add Pac-12 Networks to their lineup.”
No, Larry Scott!  Instead I’m presssuring you to get your carpet-baggin’ butt back to New York or Harvard or wherever you took up your chosen sport of girls’ tennis, and take Utah, Colorado, and your phony network with you.    You, personally and underhandedly picked the 100th meeting of Cal and USC–our longest-standing rival–to lever presuring Direct TV into buying into your flim-flam.  What you’ve done to the Pacific Coast Conference since arriving with your snake oil could only be carried out by someone from east of the Hudson.  How the Pacific university presidents and athletic  directors let you pull the wool over their eyes–which has turned out to be cotton–is beyond my reconing to understand.
Instead, I listened to Pete Arbogast on ESPN Radio.  You know something?  I discovered that he’s the best play-by-play radio guy since Chick Hearn called the Trojan Games on KNX, before he took up with the Lakers.  I suggest that all Trojans who can’t attend games, get to know Pete.  He’s a fellow Trojan and, in my case, a fellow Marshall High School Barrister, a couple of decades behind me.
I further suggest we mount a storm against the East Coast phony, Larry Scott, and begin to let our athletic directors and presidents know that their high-toned, politically corect, instincts to just be nice, not sound abrasive, and go along with this upstart promoter is not in the best interest of the Pacific Schools, their alums, and West Coast fans..
Fight On!
JLH
PAC-12 is being ridiculous insisting that Directv charge all customers for this station.  I am willing to pay for it as a stand alone channel but I wouldn’t be watching the channel at all if my kid wasns’t a student at SC!  And who watches all the other sports – water polo, volleyball, etc.  An occasional fan of the sport, the terminally bored or parents!
The real answer is that PAC 12 Networks should just GO AWAY. That’s not progress, it’s ridicoulous. Who in the HELL needs it? Is there a problem with ABC, NBC, CBS, ESPN?
Where did thid idea of PAC 12 Networks come into play anyhow? I do not see that the have any place in the scheme of Modern TV!!!! 
PAC 12 Netyworks: GO AWAY!!!!!!!!!!
pac 12 i am willing  to buy a complete collge footbal season, why dont you try that
“When I found out I couldn’t find the game on USC’s cable service I was really upset,”
http://dailytrojan.com/2012/08/30/pac-12-now-app-debuts/
“The station launched on Aug. 15 and is now available through USC cable on channel 12-1.”
So which is it?  Even University Gateway residents managed to find the Pac-12 Network for this game (and we didn’t have it in week 1 of the football season)

As an investigation into a 125-person Harvard University cheating scandal progresses, a national focus has been placed on concerns about widespread cheating and how to prevent it at universities across the country.
At USC, administrators said they deal with cheating through the use of preventative software and academic consequences. Despite this deterrent, there have been 291 reported cases of academic dishonesty during the 2011-12 school year.
The most common punishment for cheating is a grade of an ‘F’ in the course, regardless of whether the incident was premeditated or a lapse in judgment, according to Raquel Torres-Retana, the assistant dean of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards.
The Harvard Crimson reported that nearly half of the 279 students enrolled in a government introductory course last spring are currently being investigated for “allegedly plagiarizing answers or inappropriately collaborating” on last spring’s take-home final exam.
Daniel Mathews, a junior majoring in economics, said the cause of cheating could stem from the notion that students have more pressure to do well in school to make their future more secure.
“It’s a risk-versus-reward analysis,” Mathews said. “Do the benefits of cheating and doing well on this paper outweigh the risk of getting caught? And for the people who do cheat, the answer is clearly yes.”
Kimberly Su, a junior majoring in mathematics, echoed Matthews’ sentiment.
“Now, everyone is so focused to get a decent job after you graduate and getting to the next part of their life,” Su said. “For some people, they think cheating gets them to that point.”
The cheating scandal at Harvard has triggered awareness at universities across the country, causing schools to look for more stable safeguards against academic dishonesty.
At USC’s Gould School of Law, Jane Chang Bright, the assistant director of student computing services, oversees the use of SofTest, a program designed to prevent students from cheating.
“The software basically turns your computer into a typewriter, which brings about a secure exam mode. All of our exams are secured,” Chang Bright said. “All of the bar exams, the 42 states that use SofTest — those are all in secure mode. [Students] can’t get to the Internet, can’t get to their online notes, can’t open PDFs, can’t instant message with anybody.”
The digital age has brought about new techniques for preventing cheating across campuses, according to Bright.
“Now everything is done over the Internet: installations over the Internet, upload of exam files when [students] are done, everything,” Chang Bright said.
Rather than concerned about cheating via the internet, USC should take care of the in-class exam cheating first!
I was so pissed when I saw my classmate cheated using his iPhone on his lap during a GE 2 (EASC 150g) final exam!
well if Harvard can have problems..
Wow. USC uses a software package that purportedly prevents cheating among some of its highest-performing students. Do they not have any confidence in the integrity of their student body?
In any case, it’s not that hard to get around SofTest. Oops. Was that supposed to be a secret?

In a departure from typical political discussions along party lines, the USC Schwarzenegger Institute Inaugural Symposium kicked off the center’s first semester with a bipartisan look forward into political change.
A morning panel, which featured high-profile politicians such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), covered topics ranging from campaign spending to political corruption. When the symposium reconvened in the afternoon, the focus turned to the role of Hollywood in society as a panel of media executives delved into their industry.
Forum · Politicians and experts explored solutions for an increasingly partisan government at the USC Schwarzenegger Institute Inaugural Symposium on Monday, – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
Changing partisan boundaries
“To use a very scholarly phrase, meaningful change takes balls,” the institute’s namesake, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said to a packed house of 750 on Monday.
Change and the courage to incite change was the focus of the two-hour morning event, which featured a welcome address from USC President C. L. Max Nikias, among others.
“Like USC, Governor Schwarzenegger knows nothing is impossible when it is possible to come together beyond the poisonous atmosphere of partisanship,” Nikias said.
Veteran political journalist Cokie Roberts delved into the politics of partisan government while moderating a panel of political experts including Charlie Crist, former governor of Florida; Tom Daschle, former senator and senate majority leader; Tom Ridge, former governor of Pennsylvania; Bill Richardson, former governor of New Mexico; and McCain.
Though the panel touched on issues such as the Citizens United ruling and the fiscal cliff, the discussion focused on finding a better way for government to handle these issues.
The speakers acknowledged that most politicians see party divides as a necessary evil of the system and  that they tend to stick to their own talking points rather than spend time working with their opponents.
“It’s much easier to be an ideologue than it is to be someone who drives compromise,” Ridge said. “The easiest vote in Washington is ‘no.’”
But McCain analyzed the deepening party divide as something more serious: He referred to it as the source of the next national downfall.
“The history of this country has been corruption, reform, corruption, reform,” McCain said. “There are going to be major scandals because too many millions of dollars are washing around in political campaigns.”
Corruption, especially because of donations from interest groups to political campaigns, also increases party differences, Daschle said.
“What’s happening is that the grassroots politics have taken over the parties,” Daschle said. “You add grassroots politics, where the interest groups become stronger and stronger at the expense of the party, and blend into that money and media, and you’ve got an entirely different dynamic where people don’t understand what it really takes to work with the legislative process.”
Even when there is collaboration between legislators and executives from opposing parties, however, Schwarzenegger said the culture of divide can remain.
“Whenever you worked with Democrats, the Republicans hated you, and whenever you worked with the Republicans, the Democrats hated you,” Schwarzenegger said. “It’s not to win a popularity contest. That is not why you go to Sacramento or Washington.”
Though Schwarzenegger said he experienced the political divide during his tenure as governor of California, Richardson said states are often better off than the nation as a whole. Richardson cited his experience cooperating with a republican legislature during his term as a democratic governor of New Mexico as evidence that bipartisan cooperation is possible.
Perhaps the largest problem in partisan politics that many panelists touched on was the lack of respect opposite parties have for one another. Crist said he experienced this personally when he was vilified by fellow Republicans after hugging President Barack Obama.
“The idea that some in my former party would so disdain that act of decency, and I can understand the political ramifications and why they would see it that way, but being nice to somebody, and being decent, and being chastised for it is exactly what we need to stop doing,” Crist said.
Breaking out of the habit of working against the other party and instead working with them might be a shift for many politicians, but as Schwarzenegger said, “Political courage is not political suicide.”
 
Entertainment and social change
The event wasn’t entirely focused on the partisan divide, though. The afternoon session of the symposium, titled “The Power of People and Innovation — Perspectives of Media and Hollywood Leaders,” hosted a discussion on the role that the entertainment industry plays when it comes to innovation and social change.
Entertainment executives as well as students from the Sol Price School of Public Policy, Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Gould School of Law and School of Cinematic Arts participated in the event.
The panel was moderated by Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed.com, and took place in the Tutor Campus Center ballroom.
At the panel, Schwarzenegger emphasized the important role that the entertainment industry plays in shaping society’s collective social conscience.
“The power of films and television is enormous,” Schwarzenegger said. “I think it is much more powerful than politicians will ever be.”
The panel also touched on the interaction between entertainment and technology and the resulting innovation. Participants noted that one of their biggest concerns in this realm is in regards to piracy.
“Piracy is a giant, giant problem for us as an industry,” said Rob Friedman, co-chairman of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “We absolutely learned from the music industry.”
One of those lessons lies in how to best harness customers, according to panelists.
“Anyone who’s licensing, buying our product is a friend,” said Brian Grazer, Chairman of Imagine Entertainment. “The important part is we’re getting paid for it.”
Though the industry has maintained a way to generate profit, executives said they have not yet found a perfect answer.
“Piracy is of course the major issue. We are all of course looking for a solution for it,” said Ron Meyer, president and chief operating officer of Universal Studios and NBCUniversal.
Another important topic the panel discussed was the influence the entertainment industry has on culture. Many of the panelists spoke of the role that they believe studios and entertainment executives have in shaping culture as well as societal perception.
“We have the chance as an industry … to tell a story that can make an impact on society and change the way people think and feel,” Meyer said. “We [as filmmakers] have an obligation — an opportunity — to tell those stories.”
Grazer, who won the 2001 Academy Award for best picture for his work on A Beautiful Mind, talked about what he sees as his personal role in the entertainment industry.
“If there’s any way to elevate people’s point of view culturally or artistically, I want to be on the forefront of that,” Grazer said. “[In the entertainment industry] you get to help de-stigmatize mental disability and empower kids and their parents.”
Empowering their viewers, many panelists said, is what they hope to achieve in their industry.
“We continue to try to educate, to inform and to change attitudes,” Friedman said.
Professor Schwarzenegger?
How low will Max N.  squat to pick up dirty $$$???
Ahnold is a disgrace to this great university.
I’m impressed! I haven’t see a bigger bunch of losers since the 2011 Colts.And the panel’s ridiculous self-praise reminds me of the Adult Film Awards scenes in “Boogie Nights” where the pathetic porn stars emulate the self-adulation of the Academy Awards.

When talking about musical theater, one might think of big group numbers, dramatic lighting and extravagant costuming, all set in a decorative 2,000-seat auditorium. Jason Robert Brown’s The Last Five Years, however, redefines those expectations by utilizing the only two things you need to tell a great love story: two people.
Stage lovers · Juan Lozano and Kate Bowman star as Jamie and Cathy in The Last Five Years. Both actors give highly emotive performances. – | Photo courtesy of Lisette Azar
From its intricate narrative configuration to Brown’s notoriously complex melodies, The Last Five Years is a unique and challenging show to produce. But that didn’t stop the newly formed K Boulé Pictures from brilliantly tackling a production that has become a cult classic since its 2001 Chicago debut.
The Last Five Years tells the story of a marriage between Jewish novelist Jamie Wellerstein (Juan Lozano) and girl-next-door theater actress Cathy Hiatt (Kate Bowman). Though his career as an exuberant young writer is skyrocketing, hers isn’t quite matching up as she struggles to land even the most unpleasant acting jobs.
The musical’s unique qualities stem from the way the show plays with the concept of time. In the beginning, Cathy mourns the loss of her five-year relationship with Jamie, while Jamie can’t contain his excitement coming off his first date with Cathy. From that point, he moves forward in time while she recedes backwards. It’s rare to see the two actors actually share the stage —in fact, they only experience the same moment at the same time when their storylines intersect on their wedding day.
Though the musical traditionally only employs two players, director Kristen Boulé decides to bring a fresh dimension to her version by adding shadow dancers (Daniel Johnson and Macy Reyes) to act as the memories of Jamie and Cathy. Dancing on a platform raised behind a canopy above the stage, the silhouettes of the performers allow the main actors to unite with their shadows from the stage. This creative decision proves to be a fruitful one, as it allows viewers to sense a genuine interaction and fills an otherwise empty space on the stage.
Because of the show’s complicated storytelling arrangement, the actors run into difficulties when tasked with portraying contrasting emotional situations during the first two scenes. To begin, we see Cathy alone in her room, sobbing during the poignant “Still Hurting.” Immediately following, Jamie explodes onto the stage with the playful “Shiksa Goddess,” a witty tune about how he sees himself falling in love with Cathy, despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that she is a gentile. While the audience appreciates that both actors have to jump feet first into such extreme mental states, it comes across as somewhat contrived, and their voices and acting styles feel a bit forced.
Both actors, however, quickly regain their footing with their subsequent numbers. Bowman’s performance during “See I’m Smiling” feels raw and heartbreaking as she tries to hold onto what’s left of her crumbling marriage. For Lozano, his shining moment comes with the often overlooked “Schmuel Song,” in which he tells Cathy a charming Jewish folktale during Christmastime to explain to her that time is on her side to make her dreams come true. Using his whole body to tell the story, Lozano’s performance in this scene is wonderfully endearing, especially at the end of the song when he asks, “Have I mentioned today how lucky I am to be in love with you?”
Another standout moment for Bowman comes during “Climbing Uphill,” when she vents about the labors of finding a decent acting job. The number serves as a needed moment of comic relief as she hilariously comments through her disastrous audition. The scene perfectly matches Bowman’s sensibilities as an actor and allows us to peek even further into Cathy’s psyche. (“I will not be the girl who requires a man to get by,” she exclaims.) Bowman shines in this scene, giving the audience the biggest laugh of the night with her impeccable timing and admirable honesty.
Like “Climbing Uphill,” Lozano’s most powerful and important section of the show comes during the visceral “If I Didn’t Believe in You.” Not only is this song an imperative turning point for Jamie and his frustration with Cathy and her lack of self-confidence, it’s also one of the most heartbreaking parts of the entire show. It’s understandably a tough scene to pull off considering he has to have an argument with someone who isn’t physically there. Still, Lozano scores with this song, as we can feel his frustration: “I will not lose because you can’t win.”
With subjects like love found and love lost, career decisions, jealously and infidelity demonstratively explored throughout The Last Five Years, it’s a musical that college students particularly can relate to and enjoy. It’s also a show that provokes endless conversations after its viewing, as both character’s stories are so nuanced and can be left up to interpretation thanks to Bowman and Lozano’s acting chops and Boulé’s expert directing.
 
The Last Five Years shows Thursday-Sunday at 8 p.m. through Oct. 6 at the Hudson Guild Theatre, located at 6539 Santa Monica Blvd.

If you thought horror mazes and haunted houses were the most frightening aspects of Halloween, try a red carpet chock-full of vampires, zombie brides and some of Hollywood’s most frightening celebrities.
On Friday night, Universal Studios kicked off the Halloween season and its annual Halloween Horror Nights with the Eyegore Awards, celebrating all that is not necessarily horrifying but largely affiliated with Universal. For example, four of the six award winners have various connections with Universal: Guillermo del Toro is producing the new Universal picture Mama, Bitsie Tulloch and Silas Weir Mitchell star in the NBC show Grimm, host McKenzie Westmore hosts Syfy FaceOff and Alice Cooper is the face of one of Horror Night’s frightening mazes.
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated NBC co-produced the Eyegore Awards. NBC was not involved in the production of the event.]
The Eyegore Awards offered a narrow peek into the unique culture surrounding the horror genre. A bizarre mix of potential honorees — from horror filmmakers to basketball players — highlighted the universal and genre-defying appeal of scary movies. After all, everyone likes to have a fright every now and then.
Unfortunately, the Eyegore Awards proved to lack purpose and influence in the Hollywood community (besides some pretty neat gargoyle trophies). The award ceremony, which was a measly 30 minutes long, played out as more of a promotion than anything else. A trailer for Guillermo’s new thriller was shown at the close of the event at which point one audience member shouted, “That’s it?!” The presence of a few household names does not equal legitimacy.
To truly establish itself as a reputable beacon of the niche industry, the Eyegore Awards need to be more inclusive. Is Grimm really the first thing that comes to mind when one hears “horror genre?” Is the mundane FaceOff the best place to draw a host for a horror movie awards show? Where was the creative team behind Prometheus or the writers of The Cabin in the Woods?
The production falls flat because it is not a wholesome representation of what the genre has to offer. The Eyegore Awards are largely self-serving and blind-sighted to the bigger picture.
The true treat for the evening came when the black iron gates to Universal were opened and the Halloween Horror Nights came to life.
With six mazes, one tram ride and a large group of scare-actors, the logistics are incredible. Nowhere is safe (minus the safe zone, of course). Bloodstained crazies with chainsaws, Frank, the rabbit from Donnie Darko, sadistic clowns and macabre zombies freely roam the streets of Universal Studios. No park-goer is exempt from being approached with a knife or getting growled or screamed at. Even Universal employees working the awards ceremony are attacked. The dead don’t play favorites.
Lines for the signature mazes are massive. Thousands of park-goers wait upward of 90 minutes for a five-minute stroll through attractions such as Alice Cooper Goes to Hell 3-D, La Llorona: La Cazador de los Ninos (The Child Hunter), Welcome to Silent Hill, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Saw is the Law, Universal Monsters Remix and The Walking Dead: Dead Inside. But for horror fans, the wait is well worth it.
Alice Cooper Goes to Hell 3-D offers an intriguing visual experience. With 3-D glasses in hand, guests who are brave enough walk into a phosphorescent maze that initially seems more akin to a Dr. Seuss fantasyland than a haunted maze. But the 3-D glasses warp the experience: Bright colors become visual obstacles, and the changing scenery alters the walker’s depth perception, making the walk through the maze treacherous and arguably more frightening than all of the attractions. While the patrons walk through embodiments of the seven deadly sins and arrive at a Dante-accurate representation of an icy hell, monsters, murderers and mayhem strike around every corner.
John Murdy, creative director of Halloween Horror Nights, is the man responsible for creating this month-long event and is tasked with the challenge of outdoing himself every year. Because of the TV show’s popularity, Murdy brought the idea of bringing AMC’s The Walking Dead to life for Horror Nights, which came to fruition in The Walking Dead: Dead Inside maze and the Horror Tram.
The Walking Dead: Dead Inside caters to fans of the hit AMC show; the maze is constructed to be as true to the storyline as possible. The uninfected cautiously round corners to find the iconic trailer littered with walkers and a few familiar faces: the porous zombie who was stuck in the well at Hershel’s farm, the disturbingly massacred walker with no legs and a host of other familiar faces that fans will be dying to see.
The Horror Tram compliments the Walking Dead maze by taking pass holders on a unique version of the Studio Tour, which is quite an unexpected haul. Beware of hordes of zombies and men with chainsaws — as with the rest of the park, the cast and crew won’t be babying anyone who decides to take on this attraction.
Though the other mazes offer equally frightful and enjoyable experiences, the sheer magnitude of the crowds are a staggering drawback. Waiting in lines for more than an hour dampers an already short night. For a full experience, guests should buy a Front of the Line pass to ensure they get to see every maze and ride every attraction in the few hours of the night that Horror Nights is open.
Similarly, the mazes reek of sweat and are extremely hot, though some might say that this adds to the maze experience (seeing as how each is saturated with blood and cadavers). Admittedly, each is maybe a five-minute walk at best, but the atmosphere is suffocating. The uncomfortable environment and the relentless onslaught of living dead jumping out from walls turns out to be a great impetus for keeping lines moving. Zombies: crowd control at its finest.
Halloween Horror Nights is a scream. And after a tough week of classes and impending midterms, it’ll be nice to go for a stroll with an axe murderer or take a soothing boat ride through a hazy Jurassic Park.
[Correction: This article has been revised from its original version to clarify the writer’s perspective on the event.]
Would love to take this tour this Halloween

A surprise gift of new clothes from a high-fashion line would brighten anyone’s day, but the Esshaghian family chooses to donate to a particular group: cancer patients.
USC alumnus Benjamin Esshaghian helps women cope with cancer by using his family’s fashion company, Belldini, to give back to those in need. The company hosts a sweepstakes to give away fashion pieces to cancer patients.

“We feel that we have been blessed as a family and blessed as a company,” Esshaghian said. “We have grown to be a brand name in the United States, and as a family, we feel that it is important to give back and to help out others to our full capability.”
Esshaghian took over his father’s 30-year-old fashion business, Belldini, after graduating from USC’s Marshall School of Business in 2006. Esshaghian runs the clothing line with his two siblings.
“The reason I went to Marshall was so that I could gain a business background [before] going into the family business,” Esshaghian said. “I started my own construction company [on the side] as well, so I knew I needed a business education to help me out in the future.”
The company has been built up greatly over the past 30 years, making a huge impact on the fashion industry as well as in many women’s lives.
“We just came back a couple of days ago from Denver where we did a sweepstakes for a woman named Genny,” Esshaghian said. “Her mother wrote in for her and she won the sweepstakes. We flew out there with our entire fall collection and surprised her with our line.”
Genny, a single mom, was diagnosed with two forms of blood cancer, for which the only cure is a bone marrow transplant. She helped develop a non-profit organization that aims to conduct college bone marrow donor drives.
Jennifer, another patient, found out that she had leukemia three days prior to her wedding day and underwent her own bone marrow transplant. During their treatments, Genny and Jennifer met and instantly became friends.
After Genny won the sweepstakes, her mother requested that the wardrobe prize be shared with Jennifer. Though there is normally only one winner, after reading the heartwarming request, Belldini decided that both Genny and Jennifer would each get their own wardrobes from the fall collection.
“Women all write in to us and we read over their stories and collectively … decide which one we feel best deserves our line,” Esshaghian said. “It is a hard decision to make at the end of the day, but nonetheless they are all winners at heart.”
In addition to the sweepstakes, Belldini makes donations at the end of the year to Chrysalis, a foundation that provides clothing for women who have job interviews.
“The sweepstakes is something that we are just starting to do, and we think we are going to be doing them throughout the United States every month,” Esshaghian said.
While Esshaghian wasn’t involved in many community service activities while he was attending USC, he has always been interested in running a business.
“It was hard to do community service in college because while I was in college I started my real estate company,” Esshaghian said. “My senior year I started developing my first home in my construction business so [I was always] working on my projects and being a full-time student.”
In addition to managing Belldini, Esshaghian continues to build homes for his construction business.
“I build about two brand new homes in Beverly Hills every year,” Esshaghian said. “There is no specific company that I have because every job that I do is its own entity. All the homes that we build have their own website so that people can go online and see what kind of homes that we build.”
Esshaghian strives to be a positive influence on USC students by providing them with advice that he took while he was attending college.
“Network as much as possible,” Esshaghian said. “Get a job while you’re in college with any company that you can in any field that you can no matter what position you have. The salary should have no basis on what kind of a job you have in college. It should be in the field you want no matter how much you’re getting paid.”
Though he has his hands full with running two companies, Esshaghian remembers his time at USC and plans to stay involved in the community.
“USC absolutely benefited me. It is a great school and has great programs, especially the real estate classes and the finance classes,” Esshaghian said. “I still go to football games. I’m going to try to go to the homecoming game this year.”

With controversial films like The Master and Savages hitting theaters and dominating box office profits, it’s easy to take creative liberty for granted.
We live in a time where if you want to take your vision and bring it to a big screen or canvas, no one can really stop you.
Words meet art · Jenny Holzer’s sculpture “Blacklist,” on display outside of Fisher Museum of Art, features famous 20th-century quotes and acknowledges the artistic struggles of the “Hollywood Ten.” – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Decades ago, however, that wasn’t necessarily true. If you look back to October 1947, you will discover a much more tense climate for artistic production. That time proves the focus of the outdoor sculpture by Jenny Holzer, “Blacklist.”
Located near the doors of USC’s very own Fisher Museum, the work arose from the suggestion of undergraduate student Drew Weinbrenner. In 2005, the sculpture came to life as a garden seating area that features important quotes from the turbulent time. The work especially gives attention to the “Hollywood Ten,” a group of filmmakers asked to stand before the House Un-American Activities Committee for scrutiny because of their political beliefs. The Hollywood Ten’s refusal to cooperate put their names on a blacklist, which prevented them from gaining future employment. Some of the members even found themselves in prison.
During the ’40s and ’50s, many other creative minds also came under examination and “Blacklist” stands as a reminder of these events. In light of modern American entertainment, which gets away with quite a bit of controversial and risky material, the sculpture becomes even more important.
Amid other works of art in a calming garden, the work would perhaps go unnoticed by passers-by, who might perceive the sculpture as just a seating area. But once you enter the work, it immerses you in its history.
When you first walk up the steps and walk up to any of the 10 benches, you encounter quotes from names such as Gregory Peck and Alvah Bessie. Each of the 10 benches belongs to one of the Hollywood Ten, with the members’ names on the side and a quote with the year on top.
Known for working with text in everything from projections to LED lights, Holzer masterfully creates a unified piece. The artist utilizes the circular shape of the work cleverly, placing quotes along the round edges. As viewers enter, they walk straight on top of these quotes and let the words of the Hollywood Ten guide them around all 10 of the benches.
“My opinions are not an issue in this case. The issue is my right to have opinions,” reads one bench engraved with a 1947 quote from John Howard Lawson, head of the Hollywood division of the Communist Party USA. Regardless of viewers’ political opinions, these quotes provide insight into an age where artists’ work was dramatically affected by censorship.
Though situated in a quiet corner of campus, the work speaks loudly. The fact that viewers must know where to look in order to find the work only reaffirms Holzer’s idea: In order to appreciate a past where controversial art led to serious legal issues, we must look past today’s free creative climate.
The location also raises another question: Shouldn’t the work be near the School of Cinematic Arts? It would seem so at first glance, however, though the subject matter obviously pertains more to SCA than to the Roski School of Fine Arts, that would limit the message to only one world. Holzer remains an important and respected artist whose messages reach out to all members of society through common issues such as economics and gender.
Holzer creates an experience that could leave students who don’t have a background in film history with a feeling of awe. Moreover, she chose the quotes with care, as they have the potential to leave an impression on whoever might read them. Quotes such as “Only an act can be a crime, never an idea” from journalist and screenwriter Ring Lardner Jr. apply to fields outside of the film industry.
As a group, the quotes invoke images of how these figures spoke out against censorship and helped bring true creative freedom. Though some might argue that American artists today still suffer from forms of censorship, their struggle doesn’t compare to that of artists from decades ago.
Holzer lets us sit in on 1940s artist’s hardships and allows us to appreciate today’s artists’ creative freedom. In the solitude of the garden, we can take in history and use it to shape the future.
Holzer focuses on the power of words: If these figures could change history through their declamation against an unfair system, nothing can stop us from doing the same decades later.
Art, however, remains an important part of this effort. These powerful quotes might live on through words, but art provides a way to easily communicate this section of history.

“I can’t change … I’m a broken- down old man,” Clint Eastwood’s character, Gus, explains in Trouble with the Curve. A few scenes later, Gus’ younger coworker proposes that Gus “may be ready for pasture.”
Could these lines be subtle hints that Eastwood is considering retirement? Perhaps.

What these words really reflect, though, is that Eastwood’s star power, hefty as it might be, isn’t enough to salvage a mediocre movie.
Eastwood stars as a once-successful baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves who finds that his macular degeneration is beginning to affect his work. His daughter joins him on a scouting trip to judge his condition and hopefully strengthen their tenuous relationship.
This film, directed by Robert Lorenz, is ambitious. It aims to fuse an epic sports story with a tear-jerking family drama, even sprinkling  a little variation on the coming-of-age story (with Eastwood’s character struggling to accept that he’s aging quickly) — in short, it aspires to be a film about feelings and relationships that men are allowed to like.
On some level, it succeeds. But instead of feeling like a grand slam, it ends up coming across as formulaic and bland. In trying to achieve so much, this movie spreads itself thin.
A jumpy script exacerbates this problem, abruptly escalating tension between underdeveloped characters and relying on overly simple dialogue that sounds unnatural coming from actors who otherwise seem intelligent.
The acting is stellar overall, though. Amy Adams, who usually lends an obnoxious uppity quality to her roles, is impressively down-to-earth as Gus’ daughter, Mickey. It’s fortunate that Adams paints Mickey as such a strong female role model, because women are frustratingly absent from this film. Her reactions to her father’s emotional unavailability are very human and relatable for any viewer who has had trouble communicating with a loved one. She convinces us that she’s an assertive lawyer and a passionate baseball enthusiast, exuding elegance and shrewd intelligence. And, as always, Adams is stunning on screen; it’s nearly worth the price of admission to watch her hair bounce around and shine in the sun — and she even looks great in a catcher’s mask.
Justin Timberlake, cast as a younger scout and Adams’ inevitable love interest, makes the most out of an underdeveloped character. As we’ve learned from his past performances, especially his appearances on Saturday Night Live, Timberlake is quite the charmer. But his attempts to provide us with a little comic relief and a little eye candy for the ladies, but this makes his character all too predictable. Timberlake is too charming for this role. His performance fails to tap into the vulnerability and depression that exist inside a failed athlete.
He does, however, serve his purpose as Adams’ romantic costar. Their chemistry is moderately believable, peaking in the scenes in which they dance together. Thank goodness someone realized that these two thrive in musical theater-type situations. Here’s to hoping that Adams and Timberlake costar in a movie musical very, very soon.
And then there’s Eastwood, who, even at age 82, can captivate us with a simple squint and scowl. After his bizarre chair shenanigans at the Republican National Convention, much of the world has been questioning Eastwood’s sanity — and worse, cultural relevance — but his behavior in this film proves he is still highly compelling to watch. Though he spends most of the movie growling and acting like an ill-tempered old man — he literally calls someone “sonny” — his acting chops are evident in a few tender moments with Adams and in instances where his frustration with aging manifests in physical outbursts. Though it’s sometimes difficult to see Eastwood’s eyes through eyelids that are near perpetual slits, watch them carefully — that’s where his emotional depth resides.
Technically speaking, this film is adequate — nothing special. The cinematography is good enough that it makes viewers want to visit North Carolina. The score, which is underused, is oddly relaxing in its incorporation of gentle strings and a plucky acoustic guitar, contributing to the feeling that this is one of the most low-energy sports films ever. The sound effects and mixing expertly manipulate audience members into believing that they are as sensitive to the noises in baseball as a seasoned scout is.
Another sad and missed opportunity is found in the lame music supervision. Instead of seizing the chance to accompany athletic montages with energetic and marketable rock music as most sports films do, scenes are coupled with lukewarm pop or country songs.
Trouble with the Curve is perfectly fine for post-summer, pre-award season fare. It had the potential to be wonderful, but falls a little short, landing it firmly in the wait-to-watch-on-Netflix-when-you’re-really-bored category.
If, however, you find yourself incapable of thinking of a way to pass time with your baseball-loving grandpa, this movie might be a good choice.

It was supposed to be television’s biggest night of the year.
The buildup leading to Sunday’s 64th Primetime Emmy Awards suggested that the show would be the most exciting and fresh edition yet, but the show unfortunately proved to be another predictable and unimaginative awards ceremony that viewers will soon forget about.
Despite Jimmy Kimmel’s hosting prowess, his slew of well-timed jokes (“Being a Republican in Hollywood is like being a Chick-Fil-A sandwich on the snack table at Glee.”) and funny gags weren’t enough to save the Emmys from being what most of these shows have unfortunately become: self-congratulatory and uninteresting.
There were still, however, a handful of entertaining moments that proved worthy of watching.
As the master of ceremonies, Kimmel generated compelling TV moments with ease. This was the late-night-host’s opportunity to reach his largest primetime audience yet, and he certainly made the most of it. Though it can prove to be a challenge to engage such a far-reaching audience for three hours, Kimmel succeeded, getting laughs by virtue of his every-guy persona, honesty and non-introduction introductions.
“Our next presenters are Mindy Kaling and Melissa McCarthy. Please welcome Mindy Kaling and Melissa McCarthy,” Kimmel said, totally deadpan, as if to jokingly indicate to the nation that he doesn’t elevate actors just because they’re rich and famous.
Perhaps Kimmel’s greatest accomplishment of the night was the impressive execution of his prank on the people at home who decided not to tune in. Inviting 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan onto the stage, Kimmel told him to lie down and then asked viewers to tweet that Morgan had “just passed out” and to turn into ABC right now to witness the commotion. And to no surprise, it thoroughly worked. With big names like Joel McHale and Stephen Colbert playing along, “Tracy Morgan” was trending nationwide in no time. And Morgan committed, lying motionless on the stage for a good 10 minutes before eventually being carried away.
Another hilarious moment came in the form of a pre-taped bit starring the Modern Family ensemble, specifically focusing on 5-year-old Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who plays Lily on the show. In the feature, Anderson-Emmons is portrayed as a tyrannical prima donna who insults her castmates and even tries to physically injure Ty Burrell and Ed O’Neill by removing the stairs to their trailers.
Amy Poehler proved that, for the second year in a row, she could single-handedly make the presentation of the outstanding lead actress in a comedy category the highlight of the night.
After embracing Poehler on her way up to the stage to accept her trophy for Veep, Julia Louis-Dreyfus began to read from a speech that clearly wasn’t her own. Great directing and acting collided to create a hilarious (albeit planned) moment of comedy in which Poehler “accidentally” switched her acceptance speech with Louis-Dreyfus’.
“Isn’t it a shame Amy Poehler didn’t win?” Louis-Dreyfus asked, going along with the gag.
Poehler spearheaded the beauty pageant setup of last year’s best actress presentation, which was similarly deemed one of the more amusing instances of the broadcast. Though these types of pre-planned moments are wildly entertaining, they’re also quite time-consuming and tricky to pull off, which makes Poehler worthy of praise for her comedic finesse.
The show itself was riddled with technical difficulties that weren’t easily detectable by the TV-viewing audience, but noticeable nonetheless. One of the biggest gaffes of the night came when Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane strutted to what he thought was his mark and began to speak inaudibly, to the bewilderment of the Nokia Theatre patrons as well as viewers at home. Whether it was the director’s fault or the mistake of a stage manager, the misplaced mic mishap turned out to be one of the most entertaining moments of the night.
“That’s going to be on YouTube,” MacFarlane correctly predicted.
The awards themselves, however, were as unexciting as could be, with outstanding reality series going to The Amazing Race for the ninth consecutive year and Jon Stewart and company taking home their 10th trophy for outstanding variety series. Equally as boring was the presentation of the miniseries and movie categories, which always seem to bring what little action the Emmys have to a screeching halt. Such mind-numbing awards ought to be banished to the untelevised Creative Arts ceremony that take place the week before the Emmys, but Television Academy politics would unfortunately never allow that to happen.
In one of the night’s few surprises, Showtime’s new hit Homeland took home the top prize for drama, making it the first series win ever for the subscription-based network. But in the comedy category, Modern Family won for the third straight year, sweeping in outstanding supporting actor and actress category wins with Eric Stonestreet and Julie Bowen.
Though there were a handful of shining moments that worked in the Emmys’ favor, those glimpses of amusement were few and far between in an awards show that was bogged down with unenergetic attendees and too-long acceptance speeches.
Maybe Jon Stewart said it best while holding his trophy aloft and speculating about some future age when aliens arrive to Earth and find a box of Emmy awards:
“They will know how predictable these (bleeping) things are.”

Last Monday marked the one-year anniversary of the Occupy protests, a movement that reinvigorated the collegiate political landscape by putting student debt at the forefront of campus and national conversations.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
It’s no secret that student debt has skyrocketed in recent years, surpassing total credit card debt as the largest collective sum of money owed by Americans. And with tuition costs rising at an average rate of 7.5 percent each year, it is unlikely that this number will decrease anytime soon.
As America witnessed in the Occupy protests, society increasingly frames student debt as an impediment to post-graduate success. Last year, thousands of students camped out in Zuccotti Park in New York City to call for the immediate absolution of all past and current student loans and a plan to eliminate student debt in the future.
Building off the expectations of peers, families and society itself, students use loans as scapegoats for failure after college. Many students complain that loans inhibit them from post-college success and claim that education is a universal right.
In reality, student loans are manifestations of the adult responsibilities that graduates should and will face after college.
The financial implications of graduating lend a sense of importance, significance and truth to a degree. Because of this, reducing tuition costs to an easily affordable level would result in a drastic decline in student effort, academic maturity and independent responsibility after graduation.
For most students, college is the first time that they are on their own. This freedom entails more than just living away from their parents and guardians — for many students, it means being cut off from continuous financial support.
Leasing apartments for the first time, balancing academics with outside work and recreational activities and learning through internship opportunities are key components of the college experience. These experiences aim to prepare students to be self-sustaining adults after graduation. Paying for tuition is a critical aspect of this framework, setting students up for an independent life by lending a sense of responsibility to school work.
When students have a vested financial interest in their education, they make smarter choices in college. Impetuous decisions become more significant — skipping a night of studying to go to The Row, neglecting to attend office hours or overspending on meals at Lemonade.
Americans — students or otherwise — who call for eliminating students’ financial responsibilities in college are ignoring the detrimental effect of the continuous dependency that would plague graduates. Besides, what would be used as the qualifier for ending student tuition aid? No two students’ academic paths are the same, and appropriating a fixed amount of financing per capita is not only fiscally irresponsible, but also unfair. The free market, in conjunction with college tuition rates, forces students to focus on their futures.
Medical school students rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition fees to finance close to a decade of education. The free market encourages these students to persevere by promising large salaries for academically strong and medically proficient students. Imagine what would happen if a medical student decided to drop out of school and travel the world, leaving a massive investment by the government behind. Americans would be stuck with a gigantic bill for the development of talent that could potentially go unutilized.
Underlying the entire student debt issue is the misguided premise that collegiate education is a universal human right. In truth, education is a responsibility and privilege. University and national scholarships and financial assistance help make college something realistically attainable, but financial aid must not reach the point where students lose nothing because of their decisions in college. The pressure that loans and debt place on students is beneficial to both their studies and their futures; it forces them to take their commitments seriously.
All Trojans worked hard to get into USC and know what is expected of them in order to succeed. An inability to view education as something for which students must take financial responsibility is detrimental to society and to students themselves.

Ryan,
I, for one, applaud your article and the message it is trying to get across. Dear all liberals arts students who have 0 intention to go to law or medical school: Your degree WONT make you money. It grinds my gears to listen to these students majoring in philosophy or underwater basket weaving complain about the lack of job prospects. Earth to these majors: You have 0 marketable skills, and nothing to offer companies.
Debt is a great tool which focuses students on taking responsibility for their role in society, and ensures that the decisions they make take into account the need to save, and continue to invest in themselves. Debt teaches valuable life lessons. And to all those haters out there: Yes, I have exactly $20k in debt and am proud of it; I’d rather have a stake in my education than be going completely off of other people’s money. Because if I failed because of poor decision making, I’d have myself to blame and a mountain of debt. More than enough motivation to do what’s right.
Fight on Ryan. You have support
While it does seem that expecting personal responsibility from college students over their finances should be part of the maturation process, the reality is in the last decade the economic pressures on students has increased dramatically and has caused many students to take on more debt than they would or should assume.  These economic pressures are why we are seeing the issues of student loans as a presidential campaign issue.
I think we need a fundamental shift in how society and the business of education before we see a huge sector of educated individuals paying a significant portion of their income for many years to pay off the debts from college.   There are some attempts in the private sector to reduce the dependence on loans, such as the community funding sites like comoinis.com, but these are really just band-aids until we all sit down and re-think how we should educate people.
Has the author ever taken out a student loan? If not, legitimacyin speaking on the subject is diminished.
There are two separate issues in play here, of which it appears that the author has blurred together into one “anti-Occupy” Romney-esque argument.  Perhaps more research into higher education in California would do this article some good.
First, when it comes to loans and debt: Sure, people should take more personal responsibility when it comes to knowing their financial and legal obligations when they take on debt, whether that’s with student loans, houses, cars, etc.  Fair point.
However, your argument that without high costs and loan debt, students wouldn’t take college seriously is absolutely false and has been repeatedly proven so since 1960 and the creation of California’s Master Plan for Higher Education.
In California, up until very recently, our heavily-subsidized higher education system (UCs, CSUs) was the gem of the world.  The Master Plan for Higher Education made a promise to California students that if they wanted to go to school, they could do so and not take on serious debt in the process.  This innovative plan lead directly to the tech and biomedical boom in the 1980s and 1990s and to countless innovations and industries over the last 50 years, due to the students that came from the UC/CSU system. 
Also, when you talk about the possibility of students just quitting school because they didn’t feel “invested” because they weren’t 100k in debt, you failed to cite any graduation statistics to back up your claim.  I implore you to look at the graduation rates of UCs/CSUs between 1960 and 2000, when tuition/fees were very low.
It wasn’t the “free market” alone that forced students to focus on their futures, with debt being the ball-and-chain keeping them in school.  It was the taxpayers and state of California, choosing to invest and subsidize education and allow students to pursue higher degrees without the burden of debt. 
By keeping tuition/fees low and allowing students to flourish without the ominous cloud of debt over their heads, we were able to create a Top 10 world economy.
Ryan:
Were you aware that nearly every standard consumer protection was stripped from student loans, yet the students were (and are) rarely told before borrowing that such basic elements as bankruptcy rights, Statutes of limitations, Truth in Lending Laws, refinancing rights, state usury laws, and other protections were uniquely gone from student loans?
Did you know that the big lenders, guarantors, and even the federal government have been making money (yes, I said making) on defaulted student loans, and in fact making more money on defaults than loans that remain healthy?
Were you aware that 5 years ago, a state AG investigation found widespread examples of blatantly corrupt relationships between the lenders and schools…examples that led to the abrupt firing of Financial Aid Directors across the country, including Ivy league institutions like U Penn, Columbia, and even our alma mater (it pains me to report)?
Have you noticed the Salaries of college presidents, administrators, etc. going through the root, as the price of college rose at double, or more recently triple the rate of inflation. 
Forget about the last two questions.  Just the first two should compel you to rethink your piece.  Recasting the university income streams as learning tools, when in fact they are predatory  instruments that now threaten a large segment of the population in a very real way, strikes me as a learning opportunity for you in understanding the danger of mindlessly towing idealogical lines without doing honest research into the topic. 
No offense, buddy, but the Occupy thing wasn’t about nothing, unfortunately, and you dishonor yourself with this kind of piece by trying to turn it around on the students like that. Particulary given that (I am guessing) you, yourself have never taken, and will never take a student loan.
Fight on.  You’ll get what I’m saying with a little diligent research. 
-Alan
Alan,
It would be nice if you presented some facts to back up your assertions.
Happy to.  See the following:
1)  Consumer protections removed without warning the students:  
That the protections I mention were removed is accepted fact.  See the 1998 amendments to the Higher Education Act.   Ask any of your classmates with loans if they were explicitly informed that they did not exist for student loans prior to borrowing.  The schools are getting a bit better about making it known that bankruptcy is gone, I’ve been told, but I suspect this is still a minority of schools, USC probably included in this omission.  For historical evidence, ask Edfund (the California Guarantor) to provide loan counseling forms that they have used over the past decade or so.  Nowhere on them will you see bankruptcy mentioned. 
2) All lending elements making more money on defaults than loans that remain in good stead:
See http://www.studentloanjustice.org/defaults-making-money.html
See also:  http://www.beacon.org/productdetails.cfm?PC=2014
There is also a report from the New America Foundation showing that the guarantors make fully 60% of their income from penalties and fees attached to student loans. Bug me, and I can dig up a link for you. 
3) College/Lender corruption
http://education.newamerica.net/special_report_student_loan_scandal
Ask anyone in the Financial Aid office as well…they’ll grudgingly acknowledge the claim wrt USC. 
4)Leadership/Administration Salaries.  This should be self evident, but google “skyrocketing”, and “college president”, and “salaries” or “compensation”, and the magnitude of this claim will present itself as claimed. 
Hope this helps.

A closer look at Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s latest campaign advertisement — a Spanish-language television ad aimed at Hispanic college students and their families — reveals a half-hearted appeal to this specific voter demographic.
The ad bashes President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party for allegedly failing to deliver on its commitment to improve education. The ad highlights various statistics: 75 percent of the U.S. population believes college lacks accessibility, tuition costs have risen 25 percent since 2008 and total student debt has reached $1 trillion. Though the ad emphasizes real problems young Hispanics and their families face today, it fails to offer any insight of Romney’s plans to alleviate these problems. The ad feels demeaning — does he really think he can simply tell us education is a problem, offer us no plan to resolve it and gain our vote?
Perhaps the reason Romney does not reveal his plans for higher education in his campaign ads is because, in reality, they would not be very well received by Hispanic college students.
In fact, even if Hispanic voters visit Romney’s campaign website, they would still be left wondering what exactly Romney’s plan for higher education promises. The website is extremely vague on the issue of higher education. It only offers unsubstantiated claims, such as, “a flood of federal dollars is driving up tuition and burdening too many young Americans with substantial debt and too few opportunities.”
Though it is troublesome that no facts or studies are cited to support such a claim, the bigger problem is that the Romney campaign fails to provide prospective Hispanic voters with a detailed plan to alleviate these problems. It simply lists the following three general ideas: strengthen and simplify the financial aid system, welcome private sector participation instead of pushing it away and replace burdensome regulation with innovation and competition. The ambiguity of these ideas seems strategic, as the Romney campaign leaves much of Romney’s plan for higher education up to the imagination of prospective voters.
Perhaps the best way for prospective Hispanic voters to gain an understanding of Romney’s education policies is to keep an ear out for what he has said on the campaign trail.
While campaigning in Virginia last June, Romney revealed more of his attitude toward education:
“I want to make sure that we keep America a place of opportunity, where everyone has a fair shot,” he said. “They get as much education as they can afford and with their time they’re able to get.”
For Romney to say that the United States is a place where everyone has a fair shot is lofty and out-of-touch. Is it fair that a Caucasian student from Beverly Hills can easily afford a college education while a Hispanic student from South Los Angeles cannot? No, it’s not. And in a country where only 14.1 percent of Hispanics hold a bachelor’s degree, Romney shouldn’t suggest that students who come from low- and middle-income families shouldn’t pursue higher education simply because their parents’ bank accounts aren’t as large as their more affluent counterparts’.
Additionally, Hispanic college students would likely be displeased with the stance of Paul Ryan, Romney’s running mate, on the matter of higher education.. According to US News & World Report, Paul Ryan’s proposed 2013 budget plan would have, among other things, permanently frozen maximum Pell Grants at $5,500 per year, increased the amount of income families are expected to contribute toward college costs and made students who attend college less than half-time ineligible for Pell Grants.
It is not surprising that the Romney campaign omits Ryan’s proposal in its television ads aimed at Hispanics, considering his plan would pose a threat to the 37 percent of Hispanic college students who receive a federal Pell Grant.
By presenting a campaign ad full of education-related reasons not to re-elect Obama rather than reasons to elect Romney, the Romney campaign effectively undermines Hispanic students. The ad relies on petty attacks aimed at the Obama administration in order to avoid the fact that Romney’s higher education plan does not speak to Hispanic students’ needs.
Hispanic college students and their families should not take Romney’s ad at face value; rather, they should research the candidate’s stance on the issues presented. If they do, they will realize that Mitt Romney’s higher education plan hardly provides a reason to elect him.

Que?  Mitt “Cyborg” Romney is purely gringo and purely Mormon.  As a Mormon, Mitt feels superior to all non-Mormons and even more superior to non-white non-Mormons.  He will not win the Hispanic vote, or the student vote, or the female vote.  Even the Elders are against him. For good reason. He feels superior to all of those voters, and they know it. To gain an existential understanding of the cult that produced Mitt “Cyborg” Romney, and to get your socks scared off, read The Assassination of Spiro Agnew, available in paperback and e-book on Amazon.
Its unwilling,  part-Mexican Mormon assassin dramatizes the Mormon superiority complex, manifesting it as racism, jingoism and an anti-federal government temperament. It shows the similarities between Islam and Mormonism and reveals the secrets of Mormon mind control, the spiritual powers behind the cult.
“With a clarity of language and vision unsurpassed in contemporary American prose, Steven Janiszewski’s  Assassination of Spiro Agnew takes us into a U.S. mazed with madness and Mormonism and all things Utah, a U.S. that was then and still is.  Do we need a novel, even as brilliant as this one, about a young man on a divine mission to assassinate the Vice President because he is too liberal?  Yes, now more than ever.  Readers, welcome to a masterpiece.”

Read The Assassination of Spiro Agnew.
Word has it that David Axelrod enjoyed its  post-modern style as much as he relished being abhorred by the Mormon experience.
I’m sorry, but the person who is unclear as to their argument is not Mitt Romney, but the author herself.  Can anyone please tell me what exactly are “Hispanic students’ needs”?   Is something preventing Hispanics from pursuing a college education?  Are their educational needs different from those of other ethnicities?  Perhaps it is the author, not Romney, who is undermining Hispanics.
The only thing the author suggests Hispanics might lack is money… But outside of lotto winnings, jury awards and Vegas luck, money must be earned.  We don’t live in a socialist nation where the wealthy is simply spread evenly among the citizens.  Generally speaking, people who are energetic and alert in grade school, engaged and driven in high school, and motivated and focussed in college… are the ones who are successful and accomplished in life.  Those are the rules and nobody escapes them.
This truth is particularly evident in President Obama’s own story.  Obama (a true African American by virtue of his Kenyan father) grew up in a middle class family of very modest means.  He had a single-mom and an absentee father.  He could have chosen a path that included drugs, gangs and single parenthood… but Obama knew the importance of education.  He defied statistics and is clearly an American success story.
In criticizing the Romney campaign ad, the author makes the common mistake of suggesting the ultimate burden for ones education and self-improvment is with the government.  She essentially suggests that Hispanics ask not what they can do for the country (or themselves)… but that they ask what the country can do for them.  Ironically, despite the author’s claims, Romeny did cite 3 distinct areas for change that would improve education for all Americans, not just Hispanics… and to suggest that a brief campaign ad would go into any greater detail not only exemplifies the author’s misunderstanding of the constraints of advertising… but further underscores her belief that Hispanics need or deserve special and specific assistance.  No one of any ethnicity escapes the hard work, diligence, and personal sacrifice needed in pursuing a quality education.
Sorry, a $55k/year college education is not a right, nor should it be.  “Fairness” has nothing to do with it.
Sometimes you have to make the best of what you have, and just get out there and hustle.

As new technology climbs to the top of ways to combat crime and theft on campus, the question of efficacy invariably comes up. As the Daily Trojan reported Thursday, USC’s Dept. of Public Safety has seen recent success in tracking down stolen property through the use of security cameras and tracking software.
However, if we really want to reduce the theft problem on campus, we have to treat the cause—not the symptoms. Students need to take increased responsibility for their belongings, so that thefts can be prevented before they happen.
While video footage and tracking software might make it easier to apprehend thieves, these technologies remain extremely inefficient. Tracking software only works if a student has downloaded it in on the stolen device, and spending hours going over surveillance tapes to find a laptop or an iPhone that should have been attended by a watchful eye is a huge waste of resources.
It is not the cameras that need to come out. It is not the tracking software that needs to be downloaded. It is an attitude of caution and vigilance that needs to be cultivated.
As college students, we have left the comfort of our homes for another home—one we want to feel is just as safe. Sorry to burst the bubble, but we live in the real world now. Too often, we fall under the illusion that our Mac will be right where we left it at the library, because we trust that our neighbors will automatically watch it for us.
Students need to do whatever it takes to develop a watchful mentality. The university, meanwhile, can encourage such habits through theft prevention workshops, signs and intercom announcements reminding students to keep their belongings close.
Students can also watch out for each other, as well as themselves. We can stop our peers when we see them leaving their belongings unattended. We can keep an eye out for lost or left-behind items and turn them in to authorities.
New uses of technology can help fight theft on campus, but this is only a temporary fix. The true solution lies with every student on campus—a matter of mentality, not money or DPS resources.

The USC Trojans remain at No. 13 in the latest AP poll following a 27-9 home victory over the Cal Golden Bears on Saturday.
Despite the win, the Trojans fell one spot in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll, from No. 12 to No. 13. USC was passed in the poll by Kansas State, Florida and Notre Dame, all  four remained undefeated over the weekend. The Wildcats and Fighting Irish picked up wins against ranked opponents.
Oregon is at the No. 2 spot in both polls, an improvement in the rankings following their 49-0 blowout win over previously ranked Arizona coupled with LSU’s close 12-10 contest against the Auburn Tigers.
Despite a bye week, Stanford actually moved up a spot in the AP poll to No. 8, thanks to Oklahoma’s loss to Kansas State. The Cardinal remain at No. 9 in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll.
Oregon State’s win over UCLA knocked the Bruins out of the top 25 and catapulted the Beavers into the No. 18 spot in the AP poll and the No. 22 spot in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll. The Beavers have only played two games so far after having their season opener rained out, but beat Wisconsin, No. 23 in USA Today Coaches’ Poll, as well.
UCLA remains among the top vote getters out of the unranked teams in both polls. Arizona, Arizona State and Washington also picked up miscellaneous votes.

Marking its ninth season on the air, NBC’s hit comedy The Office premiered to its lowest season-opener ratings ever on Thursday, a 46% drop from last year. More notably, the series’ last first episode began to breed speculation on how the mockumentary is going to end its successful run.
But after nine years of used material, what could possibly be left for a show that should have ended four seasons ago?
The premiere episode seemed to provoke more questions about the final direction of the comedy than it did answers. Here’s what we do know: Kelly (Mindy Kaling) and Ryan (BJ Novak) are gone (they moved to Ohio, which Kelly hilariously mistakes for Florida when she misidentifies Miami University). Robert California (James Spader) is all but a distant memory. And Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still the man in charge at Dunder Mifflin.
While not much was set up plot-wise during Thursday’s premiere, there seems to be hints about major story and character arcs to come. The speculations have since become confirmations that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) will depart mid-season to begin work on his Office spin-off  The Farm. Since there was no mention of his exit in the premiere, something will have to happen soon if the eccentric salesman is to be motivated to return to his beet farming ways. But exactly how they’ll segue Dwight into his new show is still a complete mystery.
One of the most fascinating storylines that’s worth speculating about is that of the adorable fictional couple that is Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). During the episode, we see Jim agreeing to take part in an exciting business venture away from the office without consulting his other half first. On top of that, we get the sense that Jim is feeling restless in the monotony of marriage and fatherhood. There’s already a lot set up here for dramatic moments, and perhaps even a not-so-happy ending for Jim and Pam. Everything for them has been going extraordinarily well up until this point, and while not giving them the Rachel and Ross à la Friends finale that most might expect, it may be refreshing for the pair to not have a blissful sitcom ending.
And while everything is still speculation right now, exciting things seem to be on the horizon in Scranton. New customer service reps Clark Duke and Jake Lacy might bring opportunities for interesting alliances. Stephen Colbert is set to make a guest appearance, and Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston will direct an episode entitled “Work Bus” to air in October.
So while making nine seasons of any show might produce stale results after a while, The Office still has the potential to wow audiences like it did back in 2005 with its signature one-liners and its unmatched attention to character. Until then, we ought to enjoy the time we have left with America’s favorite paper company.
Even though most people would agree that The Office should have ended with Michael Scott leaving, I can still see potential for the show to pull off a solid, final season. After watching the season premiere last night on my Hopper DVR, I’m on board with your Jim and Pam speculations. It would be a strong move for the writers to not finish their love story on a happy note—a curveball that I would applaud. One of my coworkers at DISH will be devastated if it ends sadly, though; she is one of, if not the biggest, Jim and Pam supporters on this planet. I’ll have to avoid the spoilers until I have the time to catch up on my PrimeTime Anytime recordings. Thankfully I won’t miss anything, because PrimeTime Anytime auto-records on my Hopper—plus 1 for a forgetful guy like me! Did you hear that Stephen Colbert will be playing the legendary Broccoli Rob? I’m sure it will be nothing short of an amazing a cappella moment.
