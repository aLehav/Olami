A jury found suspended Los Angeles Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas guilty on seven felony counts of bribery, conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud Thursday, in connection with a federal corruption case implicating former Dworak-Peck School of Social Work dean Marilyn Flynn.
Prosecutors accused Ridley-Thomas and Flynn of operating under a quid pro quo agreement, with the former dean exchanging favors for the suspended councilmember’s son, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, for pushing bills favorable to Dworak-Peck in City Council. Flynn pled guilty last September for her role in the scheme.
Ridley-Thomas funneled $100,000 through USC into his son’s nonprofit, the Policy, Research & Practice Initiative, prosecutors alleged. Throughout the trial, lawyers for Ridley-Thomas argued that his actions were lawful, although he himself did not testify. Conversely, United States Attorney Martin Estrada successfully argued that “Ridley-Thomas engaged in a corrupt conspiracy with [Flynn] to steer taxpayer-funded contracts to the school in exchange for benefits for his son.”
Throughout these actions, prosecutors said, leaders at USC were unaware of the planned donation, which violated University policies and would not have been approved. 
Outside of the donation, Flynn ensured his son also received a full-ride scholarship for a master’s degree, along with a professorship that violated University guidelines. However, jurors expressed that the donation was the biggest deciding factor in tipping the scales to find Ridley-Thomas guilty. 
The jury’s verdict — guilty of bribery, conspiracy, mail fraud and four counts of wire fraud — comes after a weeks-long trial and five days of jury deliberation. Ridley-Thomas was acquitted on 11 counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud. 
Ridley-Thomas’s political career has been extensive, spanning several decades of service in L.A. and California. Throughout the trial, limited seats were packed with his supporters, who saw him as a long-time leader for civil rights in the city. 
Though he was suspended, the L.A. City Charter now requires the councilmember’s complete removal following his felony conviction.
Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 14. Ridley-Thomas faces maximum sentences of five years for his conspiracy count, 10 years for bribery and 20 years for each count of fraud.

My menstrual cycle this month lasted 16 days and was a week after the cycle before that. According to the Mayo Clinic, “menstrual flow might occur every 21 to 35 days and last two to seven days.” I bled for three weeks. 
I started using the birth control pill when I was 16 as a method to control my menstrual cycle. 
As a competitive runner for both cross country and track and field, I was constantly pushing my body to its limits — always reaching for a new personal record. With that came amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation that is often associated with those with eating disorders and professional athletes. Severely underweight and constantly working out, the energy I was exerting didn’t match up with the energy I consumed, forcing my body to find energy elsewhere — my reproductive system. As an exhausted junior in high school, I didn’t stop to think about the long-term effects of the pill on my developing body, and my doctor at the time mentioned nothing of it. Perhaps it was because scientists today still don’t know for sure what these effects are. 
A 2020 systematic review article conducted by researchers from Stavanger University Hospital found that hormonal contraceptive drugs resulted in “structural and functional changes in areas involved in affective and cognitive processing, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus.” However, out of the 33 articles that met their inclusion criteria, only one study had an adolescent sample population.
The study’s conclusion states the following: “There is a need for systematic research that considers the differences in formulation and administration of the various contraceptive drugs, employing a longitudinal, within-subject design with matched and randomized control groups consisting of HC-naïve subjects.”
If more research is needed, why are women and young girls across the world continuing to be prescribed hormonal contraceptives? 
My first type of birth control pill stopped working three years ago, with my menstrual symptoms only worsening. Since then, my doctors have told me the same old story, “Women often face inconsistencies with their period, and you’re currently on a low dosage of hormones so let’s try a different one.”
I’ve been on Estarylla, Hailey and Isibloom. Just last week, I was prescribed another new one during my visit to my OB-GYN. 
Despite my pleas and story about how the past three birth control pills have only made my period worse and taking a break from them didn’t help either, the woman that sat in front of me who claimed to be my doctor, an advocate for my wellbeing, said the same thing all the other doctors said: “It’s probably just hormonal.” 
Maybe it is. But I don’t know for a fact that it isn’t. 
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous masses found in the uterus that often go unnoticed but other times can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain. According to the Mayo Clinic Dr. Michelle Louie, who specializes in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery, “75 to 80% of people with a uterus will be diagnosed with fibroids at some point in their lives. These growths often show up … most commonly in your 20s to 30s … Each case is a bit different.”
Without even checking, my OB-GYN claimed the solution to my problem was a pill. 
According to Grand View Research, “The U.S. contraceptive market size was valued at around USD 8.0 billion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 4.70% in the forecast period.” 
So while everyone with a uterus has to choose a form of birth control that results in compromising some form of their health, the birth control industry grows richer and more ignorant of how much their products harm their patients. To make matters worse, the issue with birth control doesn’t end with misogyny, capitalism and a lack of research.
American political activist Angela Davis wrote about the eugenic influence on the birth control movement in her book “Women, Race & Class,” detailing how “birth control activists” such as Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, and Guy Irving Birch, director of the American Eugenics Society, advocated for contraceptives as a hidden method of genocide during the 20th century.
“The abortion rights activists of the early 1970s should have examined the history of their movement. Had they done so … they might have understood how important it was to undo the racist deeds of their predecessors, who had advocated birth control as well as compulsory sterilization as a means of eliminating the ‘unfit’ sectors of the population,” Davis wrote. 
In the 1950s, the first clinical trials for birth control pills were tested on Puerto Rican women who didn’t even know the pills were experimental. The trials left three women dead without any official investigations as to why. 
Then, despite its denied approval by the United States Federal Drug Administration in 1967, “Depo-Provera was still used on 14,000 women at the Grady Clinic in Atlanta, Georgia, between 1967 and 1978,” as cited by Cambridge University Press. The majority of these women eventually developed cancer with their deaths undisclosed to the FDA. 
Just from these two incidents in history, it’s more than evident that the history of birth control and healthcare for people with uteruses is littered with misogyny and racism. And it continues to remain this way.
In honor of Women’s History Month, it’s time we acknowledge that birth control has never truly worked outside of harming women of color. To all those who use hormonal contraceptive methods currently, acknowledge those who suffered for the resources you have now. And to those who make hormonal contraceptive methods, take your half-assed efforts elsewhere and start making options that actually work, not hurt. We aren’t your guinea pigs, if you want to experiment with human life to make money, do it on those with penises for a change.

The No. 2 ranked USC women’s water polo team will look to continue their streak of dominance against No. 20 ranked San Jose State Saturday. 
The Trojans are undefeated at home and currently hold a 20-1 record, with their lone loss to No. 1 ranked Stanford. The Spartans are 12-13 overall and have yet to beat a Pac-12 or top 15-ranked opponent. 
Head Coach Marko Pintaric said the team’s success has been the product of strong team chemistry with a mix of new talent and veteran experience. 
“It’s a real balanced team,” Pintaric said. “We have great leadership. With our upperclassman seniors leading the team and leading by example and younger players following it’s showing with 20 wins and one loss and that loss was a very, very close loss.”
Freshman utility Morgan Netherton said the leadership provided by the upperclassmen has helped her thrive in her role. 
“I am a freshman, and it’s not a light undertaking, especially getting in the big games with the older girls because I have so much respect for them and I look up to them as role models,” Netherton said. “They’re definitely on my case about things, and they hold me to a very high standard, which I appreciate because they treat me like they’re equal, which I am.”
Redshirt senior utility Bayley Weber attributes her stellar production to the team’s culture of selflessness. 
“Everybody wants the same goal, and I think it’s everybody’s playing the team sport: Rather than the ‘I’, it’s the ‘We,’” Weber said. “I’m only the team’s top scorer because my teammates have put me in that position. They do all the dirty work, and they just put me in the position to put the ball in the back cage.”
Last year, the team finished runner-up to Stanford and won the national title the year before. With the NCAA tournament on the horizon, Pintaric has set his team’s focus on improving with each game. 
“We always treat every game the same,” Pintaric said. “We always respect our opponent. Our goal is obviously to try to win as many games as possible, but then again, to play in every segment of a water polo game to keep improving, and those segments, obviously defense, offensive transition, power plays and so that’s where the focus is overall.”
The Trojans have never lost to the Spartans ever since the two first sparred back in 2013, boasting a flawless 14-0 record with an average margin of victory of 10.6. 
USC will face off against San Jose State at 3 p.m. Saturday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

The Kyrie Irving experiment has claimed yet another victim. The Dallas Mavericks are the latest team to incur his wrath, falling from the No. 5 seed on Jan. 14 to 11th place play-in territory by late March. The Mavericks have gone 9-13 since Irving joined the team Feb. 9, going 4-8 when he and fellow star Luka Dončić shared the floor together. Many would have expected this with Irving’s (ahem) “interesting” NBA past. 
However, this time it’s different. After all, this isn’t the result of Irving’s off-court antics on Instagram or finger-pointing in the locker room. Nope, this time the blame lies with his on-court performance. This shouldn’t be possible, considering the eight-time All-Star has contributed the same offensive statistics in Dallas that have made him a shoe-in for the Hall of Fame in fifteen years or so. His playstyle should have worked wonders with Dončić, who finally has a productive offensive No. 2 by his side. And yet, Dallas continues to lose. So why is this happening?
It’s actually rather simple: The NBA is broken and doesn’t make any sense.
I made sure to specify “NBA” and not just “basketball” there, since the college game is pretty stable and makes logical sense consistently. Ok, this year’s Final Four of a No. 4 seed, two No. 5 seeds and a No. 9 seed might not be the best example. But, for the most part, college basketball plays out how one would expect, with the good teams managing to perform nicely while bad teams, well, don’t. 
The NBA doesn’t operate like this, though, and the Mavericks are the perfect example of this phenomenon. A roster teeming with talent, an owner willing to spend a plethora of money to win and a decently competent coach should be a combination that guarantees a playoff spot. Somehow, someway, the Mavericks defy simple logic.
This goes both ways, too. The Denver Nuggets currently control the top spot in the Western Conference, but the statistics don’t seem to agree. Their defense is league average, their offense is rather slow, being 23rd in pace, and they regularly have Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in the starting lineup. That doesn’t scream “winning combination” to me. 
The Nuggets are a No. 1 seed because of one man and one man only: Nikola Jokić. The Serbian center is captaining his squad to a top-two finish in the West for the fifth straight season, doing so by dominating the floor in the wackiest and least-athletic-looking way possible. He very well may end up winning his third straight MVP as well. Jokić is an enigma that, just like the Nuggets themselves, has yet to be figured out — at least in the regular season. 
In even more puzzling matters, the Washington Wizards look to finish in near play-in-but-not-quite territory once again, which certainly begs the question: Why? It’s scripture across the league that long-term success is built upon a few years of futility. Be awful for a few years and you’ll likely draft some young talent that will boost you to the top of the standings relatively soon. 
Look at the Philadelphia 76ers, Memphis Grizzlies, Cleveland Cavaliers and practically every team in contention today — they were once the jokes of the NBA not long ago. The Wizards, however, refuse to tank, which you think would garner some respect from me. It doesn’t. Normally, I’d commend this form of spitting in the face of common opinion. If you must resort to ignorance to prove a point like Washington has, however, then you’ve lost my support.
In their defense, I shouldn’t just point a finger at the Wizards. The Charlotte Hornets and Indiana Pacers deserve some derision for their general refusal to fall into a top-three draft pick. Yet, Washington is the monarch of mediocrity and has been in that position for far too long. 
As a Wizards fan, I have been begging this organization to blow the roster up ever since they traded John Wall. But, as long as they consistently roll out a lineup of Bradley Beal, Kyle Kuzma and Kristaps Porzingis, Washington will never get that sweet, sweet No. 1 draft pick. Most fans, including myself, would even settle for the No. 2 if necessary.
Speaking of those first two selections, they may be more valuable than ever, as Victor Wembanyama and Scoot Henderson make a generational 1-2 punch atop this year’s draft leaderboard. The French-born Wembanyama is a Tyrannosaurus Rex, who, barring injury, will dominate the league for the next two decades. 
We’ve never quite seen a player like Wembanyama, whose combination of elite guard-like dribble moves and shooting combined with absurd rim protection is the archetype for the future of the NBA. Oh yeah, and he’s 7 feet 4 inches. He’s the best prospect since LeBron James 20 years ago, and he definitely deserves that title.
Henderson is nothing to scoff at either. The former five-star recruit played 19 games for the G-League Ignite before being shut down Mar. 14. But, in that short period of time, he managed to shoot up every draft board across the country. Henderson is an athletic specimen who can completely take over games with his explosiveness while also exhibiting an extremely high game IQ for a 19-year-old point guard. 
I’d say he reminds me a bit of Derrick Rose, but probably more like Russell Westbrook because: A) he has a more similar play style and B) they both look absolutely enraged whenever they step on the floor. Henderson would likely be the top choice in the majority of drafts, but Wembanyama had to go and mess it up for him. How dare he.
The Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs have completely embraced the tank and all stand a 14% chance at seizing the top selection. Whoever gets second probably won’t be too upset either. All I know is, Washington likely won’t be inserting Wembanyama or Henderson into their lineups next year. And with that, I’ll be looking ahead to 2024, with my hopes as low as ever.
In my next column, hopefully these questions will have been answered. Will the Mavericks manage to get hot and soar into postseason contention? Maybe. Did I write this entire column to call out the Wizards? Also maybe. Nevertheless, the regular season will be over, and I’ll get into my sure-to-busted playoff predictions.

On a typical Thursday afternoon, I run from a grueling lab to work a seven-hour night production shift here at the Daily Trojan. I shove away my safety goggles and check Slack on my phone, pulling out my metaphorical red pen as I edit an article while shuffling through Alumni Park. 
I’ve always done too much. I’ve always run from place to place, trying to figure myself and the world out. Throughout high school and college, I’ve felt as though I’m doing everything, everywhere, all at once, but the sum of things I do seems to be, well, nothing. (But maybe that’s my internalized job- and salary-driven college ethos talking.) 
Almost every college student knows all too well the struggle of figuring out an answer to the big question: “What do you want to do with your degree?” I couldn’t have known the answer would be so difficult to find. 
I go from one class, where a seasoned journalist preaches about the dueling importance and danger of reporting, to another, where my geology professor tells me, half-jokingly, that I’m destined to be poor if I pursue my interests. When two of my main academic foci, journalism and earth science, have more profitable “dark sides” — corporate public relations and petroleum geology — it’s easy to wonder, “Do I have to sell my soul to support myself?”
I’ve heard about the fall of print journalism, newsroom staff cuts, the rise of fake news, the murders of truth-telling reporters and the oversaturation of the media. Journalism lecturers warn against expecting the industry to be what it was several decades ago, and that’s very valid and justified. But I haven’t heard from my professors about how to adapt, as a young person considering going into the field, to the shifting journalism landscape. 
I have core values and strong morals, but I haven’t yet seen them prized in an academic setting. 
I want to advocate for the environment, for those impacted by the climate crisis. I grew up watching the lakes and forest reserves of Southern Ontario that I love become worn down by human activity and development. I saw my parents struggling with environmental health issues stemming from pollution and nuclear waste spread in the former Soviet Union, and the lack of action taken against that devastation. 
I want to write and storytell and investigate. But I’m told by my professors, my peers, my family and, especially, LinkedIn that I need to be striving for something specific, something profitable, something quantifiable. 
It’s my impression that skills, interests and relationships are increasingly commodified, especially on college campuses. In this context, it’s hard to imagine a path to success for myself: I’m turned off by the extractive nature of networking and like to spend my free time on unproductive hobbies. The thoughts always circle back to “I’m not made for this.”
In my two years at USC, I’ve felt an imposed assumption that what I spend my time doing is what I ultimately want to do for the rest of my life. When I’m spending lots of time on lots of contrasting things, this gets murky and confusing. 
If I spend 35 to 40 hours a week in the Daily Trojan newsroom, that must mean that I’ve settled on a career in journalism, right? But then, why am I staying up until 3 a.m. working on a chemistry assignment or researching media ethnography? I hear my mom’s voice on the phone pleading with me to finally choose. Choose a field, choose a job, choose a future. 
Yes, I’m doing a little too much of a little too many things. In keeping with the spirit of a liberal arts education, where knowledge should serve as a lens through which to view the world instead of a feeder into a pre-set job, I want that to be okay.

USC athletes lead busy lives, with mandatory practices, weight-lifting sessions and games alongside navigating their academic and social lives. With this heavy load, mental health becomes a concern for student-athletes navigating a hectic and ever-changing athletic landscape. 
As a result, USC Athletics has made mental well-being a primary concern of its program and has centered itself around the development of their student-athletes. 
“As a university, USC has put sports psych at the forefront of a priority for the athletes,” said Hayes Flanagan, chief operations officer of ExpositionSC, a nonprofit organization that aims to further assist USC student-athletes by allowing them to build and share their own stories. “Right when [the athletes] get here, they know who Robin [Scholefield] is, they know who the sports psych department is.”
ExpositionSC seeks to provide USC student-athletes with the means to manage their brand while allowing student-athletes to hear from one another about their own experiences. 
“We’re just really dedicated to helping these athletes share their identities beyond sport,” said Caitlin Cummings, ExpositionSC’s head of public relations. “Athletes, for so long, have just been depicted as such a single story, and I think that it is really important for us at Exposition to kind of build out the identity of the athlete beyond just their sport.”
Their first panel took place Tuesday night and featured three current or former USC student-athletes: graduate transfer track and field runner Michael Phillippy, men’s basketball sophomore forward Harrison Hornery, and former women’s volleyball standout and public speaker, Victoria Garrick Browne. 
Former Olympian Robin Scholefield, who currently serves as USC’s senior associate athletic director, was a panelist along with Yogi Roth, former USC football coach and current Pac-12 football analyst. Flanagan said they could not have been more pleased with how their panel went. 
“This [panel] was the first of its kind and it was honestly awesome to see and so rewarding,” Flanagan said. “Something like this, where you get the immediate reaction from the audience, you get the engagement, is something that’s so special.”
ExpositionSC has worked with more than 25 current and former USC athletes to provide them with a platform to create, share and learn from one another through writing, podcasting and videography. 
The hallmark of ExpositionSC is that it’s all about the athlete. Cummings said athletes reach out to ExpositionSC with their interest and, from there, the athletes engage in every aspect of the production process, such as writing, recording and editing, independently. ExpositionSC’s purpose is to serve student-athletes in a facilitator role and to help oversee the production of the athletes’ projects.
“What we’re doing at Exposition is allowing individuals to explore new topics about themselves [and] be more well-versed in the different facets of the student-athlete population,” Cummings said. “We’re really just exposing … this whole new side of athletes that’s never really even seen before. That’s not something that a sports psychology department can do … That’s something that comes from the athletes themselves.”
In the coming years, ExpositionSC will continue to provide a forum for student-athletes to discuss their experiences and, ultimately, develop a community at USC they’re comfortable and more open to seeking out help when they need it.

When Chappell Roan first emerged on the alt-pop scene as the small-town chanteuse from Willard, Missouri, she built a fanbase on her introspective songwriting and powerful vocals. In 2017, she released her debut EP, “School Nights,” which drew from rock and electronic influences. While she was inspired by artists like Lorde and Lana Del Rey, her voice and message set her apart from that of her contemporaries. 
Since then, Chappell Roan’s unique perspective has been a throughline; her recent releases “Casual” and “California” maintain her vulnerability despite the dance-pop evolution of Chappell Roan’s work. A recent highlight comes in the form of “Pink Pony Club,” a bass-booming celebration of queer resilience. On the heels of her most recent tour, “Naked in North America,” Chappell Roan sat down with Daily Trojan to talk about her mental health journey, fostering safe spaces for queer communities and her newest single, “Kaleidoscope.”
Daily Trojan: Congratulations on finishing tour! How do you feel?
Chappell Roan: I feel really tired. But it’s a good tired. I loved it. It was just so fucking hard. The shows, the [drag] queens and the band, they made it all worth it.
DT: What would you say has been that moment from the tour that you’ll take with you?
CR: My hometown, probably. I’ve never played my hometown. And I’ve never asked the crowd to put up with flashlights on their phones or whatever, but they did. I looked up from singing one of my songs, ‘coffee,’ that’s unreleased. And I just cried. 
Because it was 900 people, which is really big for how small my hometown is and it was really hard to sell [the Gillioz Theatre] out. And they did. It gave me a new appreciation and love for my hometown, which I really struggle with, because I did not have a good time growing up. 
There’s a community here for me, and I never knew that existed before then. It was really special.
DT: You’ve spoken about not identifying with who you were in the “School Nights” era anymore. Do you think that your hometown was part of that era of Chappell?
CR: Yeah. I was just really like mentally ill growing up and I had a really tough time. I wrote all those songs when I was living there and about that time in my life. I’m not there anymore, thankfully, but it’s hard to sing those songs sometimes because it’s like ‘damn, I do not feel that way anymore.’
DT: Have you heard from anybody in your hometown?
My family and friends are so supportive, but I feel, after that show, really supported by a community there. I got a few people coming up and saying, ‘Thank you for creating a queer space here,’ because it’s not predominantly queer, like West Hollywood, you know? So that was really important. 
DT: What is one word you’d use to describe who you were at that time?
CR: Lost.
DT: And what is one word you’d use to describe yourself now?
CR: Resilient.
DT: How did you get to the point where you can honor that part of yourself in the past but still recognize who you are now?
CR: Therapy. Ending relationships that were not healthy. It took years to move from that space to here. And you know, I was diagnosed with bipolar two disorder when I was 22. Medication really, really helped me. Taking care of myself really helped me.
Honestly, being single really helped me. I think we just really don’t take care of ourselves, sometimes, when we are dating someone. 
DT: You’ve said that Los Angeles — West Hollywood specifically — allowed you to be who you want. Who do you want to be?
CR: I want to be safe. I think I just want to feel safe. Whether that means being queer and being a woman, I want to provide that for other people. I want to honor my younger self and give her life that she did not get. 
Being bipolar, I was so depressed as a little kid and so angry. You just think you’re such a bad person, and don’t realize that you’re really sick and need help, and our parents don’t know how to deal with it. I think it’s like rewiring my brain to be like, ‘actually, you’re a good person, and you’re creating a safe space and music for people to dance to.
DT: There’s a lot of queer students here at USC that are coming from states in the Midwest where there has been a lot of homophobic legislation recently. As someone who was able to find yourself here, do you have any words of advice?
CR: You don’t have to subscribe to the whole system of categorizing yourself. You don’t have to be a ‘hey mamas’ lesbian or a hyper-femme girl. You don’t even have to come out. You can just be you and be like, ‘Yeah, I date girls.’
Queerness can be as much of a part of your life as you want. Some people are way more comfortable being out and loud, which is amazing. And some people want to just be really insular about it. 
I think we have to honor both of those people. I think media often wants you to be loud, and sometimes it’s really hard for people who are struggling with queerness, too scared to come out or don’t know how to identify. I think you don’t have to subscribe to a box. You can just simply be gentle with yourself. Find people who are safe to experience, to explore queerness with.
DT: The album you’ve been hinting at has not come out yet. Which song was your favorite to write in this new era?
CR: My favorite song is coming out on March 31. It’s called Kaleidoscope, and it’s the only song I wrote by myself on the album. I love collaborating, but this one just came out of me one day. We haven’t had a really sad song for a sec. It’s just really deep. I’m most excited for that.
DT: Speaking of collaborators, do you have any collaborations you’re excited about or would like to shout out?
CR: The person I work with the most is Dan Nigro. He co-writes all my stuff and he produces it for the most part. We have a few other writers too. All of my collaborators are my friends. The same friends who I went to summer camp with made my videos for “My Kink is Karma” and “Casual.” One of my best friends shoots everything for me, like all the photos, the covers, the music videos. I hire my friends and everyone is very passionate. In L.A., it’s the best thing to do because it’s such a ladder system to climb, bringing your friends up with you.
I’d also like to shout out Misha Sattar. Misha is my creative director and designed all my merch. She’s just like, amazing. She’s my best friend.
DT: If it’s alright with you, Daily Trojan has some student-submitted questions.
CR: Cool.
Jenna Peterson: I’m a huge fan of you and your song “Pink Pony Club”. And I’m impressed by how you managed to create a work that’s simultaneously in celebration of the queer community in L.A., and an homage to your hometown. How does it feel to see the track resonate with so many people?
CR: I think no matter how far I tried to push away from my upbringing, it’ll always be a part of me. No matter if I moved to L.A. in New York, that part of me, that trailer-park vibe is always part of me. It just naturally comes out in my songs. 
“Pink Pony Club” came out in April 2020, when the world was ending. It got some people through it. I got inspired by a gay club and I wrote about it because I really wanted to dance there. They had Go-go dancers, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, I want to dance so bad.’ Because it’s so sexy, and free. And I tried to capture that in a song. 
I think a lot of people like feel that way of capturing a dream of leaving your hometown and going to a big city, and being around a community that makes you happy. Even if your parents don’t approve. I think a lot of people relate to that.
Elijah Ruano: As artists, it is so important to have a unique voice and a unique perspective that kind of gives you your own style but also appeals to audiences of different kinds. How have you found your own voice along the way and how has this affected the work that you’ve been producing? And where you want to go in the future?
CR: I found my own voice by following my inner child. Like, what did a pop star look like? What did I think a pop star would be? I got to grow up with Gaga and Katy Perry. Lorde was my girly like, I’m so lucky that that was my era. I look back to that and am like ‘what can I give myself that I could not give myself then.’ 
I found my voice through therapy, through inner child work, through exploring queerness and fashion and trying things with makeup. Just exploring yourself and being letting yourself be bad at something. And I think moving out her and exploring things outside of the entertainment industry is so important. That’s how I found myself. 
DT: What’s next for Chappell Roan? Any hints of your upcoming album?
CR: It’s like Kate Bush but a little sluttier. Just a little more queer. My project is like Hannah Montana for adults.
Chappell Roan finished her first headlining tour, “Naked in North America,” at the Fonda Theatre in L.A. March 15. Her newest single, “Kaleidoscope,” comes out March 31.

As the world prepares to watch Quinta Brunson grace the screens of Studio 8H for the first time on Saturday, I am reminded why I watch “Saturday Night Live.” The lineup for the next three shows is top tier, with Brunson’s episode followed by “SNL” alum Molly Shannon and “Knives Out”’s Ana de Armas. 
I’m not going to go as far as to say I think “SNL” is funny, but I will say that the show has become a constant in my life. During a particularly sad and lonely era of my life when I did not leave my house for a month, when I was decaying in my bed that now has a permanent dip, I was also decaying in front of the television. At the time, around 2019, I would watch anything that I thought had a chance of making me laugh. 
Hulu had “SNL” from season 30 onwards and considering I had already caught up with “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” I had to find another way to get my Andy Samberg fill. I then launched on an odyssey to watch all streamable episodes of “SNL.”
As I worked my way through, I discovered one thing: To any person that says “‘SNL’ isn’t funny anymore,” I’m here to tell you it has never been truly funny. I am biased toward the late 2000s seasons, but if you actually try to sit through an episode, I promise it is quite often as painful of an experience as current seasons. 
Still, the wonderful moments of Stefon and “Laser Cats” brightened my somber days and kept me watching. 
As I began working my way through the seasons, I found that I finished season 33 at an alarmingly quick rate. A quick Google search led me to the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike, a 100-day event where television writers sought increased payment. Due to the strike, “SNL” missed out on six scheduled shows of the season, between early November and late February.
An interesting piece of television history, I found myself most concerned about NBC’s reaction. According to Page Six, 90% of the show’s production team was laid off during the strike. 
As I sat on my couch, watching the show’s return to the screen in February 2008 with Tina Fey, my energy towards the show was undoubtedly different. Originally a way to keep me distracted from the fact I was rotting away on the couch, the show became less of a magical escape. In my hardest times, consuming comedy was a way to cope. I myself couldn’t be funny, but I could rely on Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph and Seth Meyers to be. But it’s much harder to enjoy a show that lets its workers struggle.
The world of comedy can quickly get serious: punchlines become punches, scripts become strikes and laughs become layoffs. 
Between a long history of sexism and a strong lack of diversity that seems to just now be getting fixed, “SNL” has always had its problems. 
The recent threats of strikes from the “SNL” editors led me to learn even more about the problematic aspects of the show. The Motion Picture Editors Guild reported pay much lower than industry standards. Planning to begin a strike April 1, the group of workers gave NBC around a month to meet their demands. 
Last week, the editors managed to negotiate a contract with NBC, winning a pay increase and health care benefits. Their success is an incredible feat and will hopefully pave the way for better benefits for all the workers responsible for keeping the weekly show running.
At home, I’ll continue to watch the show on Sunday mornings. At school, I will continue to hold watch parties with my wonderful friends, Emma and Hadyn. Although we are often not on top of it and end up streaming episodes weeks after airing, it’s always a chance for us to catch up and spend 90 minutes hidden away from the pressures of school. 
I love “SNL.” I am grateful for the comfort the show has provided me these past four years of my life. Still, my relationship with the show will always remain complicated, but I am hopeful for positive change. The actions of the show have tarnished my love, but there is love nonetheless.

For lovers of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” or “Lord of the Rings” franchises, “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” releasing March 31, comes pretty close. The epic adventure and heist comedy film is first and foremost based on the famous Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game. However, both gamers and non-gamers alike will enjoy the spectacle that is created through the fantastical settings and the characters’ undeniable synergy.
The film is unbelievably humorous, and it does so with a perfect balance of intelligence and all-out wackiness. Structure-wise, “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” never loses momentum. The careful plotting leaves audiences anticipating who or what the characters will next encounter in their quest, combined with travel to vivid settings that stay true to its original setting of the game world. 
Chris Pine stars as protagonist Edgin Darvis, a former Harper who strayed from his job of protecting the realm to become a thief with Holga Kilgore (Michelle Rodriguez). After being thrown in prison, Edgin and Holga successfully escape. This is only to find that one of their former partners, Forge Fitzwilliam (Hugh Grant), got them imprisoned in the first place. 
Forge is collaborating with the evil Red Wizard Sofina (Daisy Head) and now rules the land as the Lord of Neverwinter. Not only that, but Forge refuses to let Edgin’s young daughter, Kira (Chloe Coleman), go after Edgin previously entrusted her to Forge’s care. 
Struck by the realization that Forge is the greedy villain of the story, Edgin and Holga decide to assemble a team that can take him down. They recruit another previous partner, the sorcerer Simon (Justice Smith). Simon leads them to Doric, a shapeshifting druid (Sophia Lillis), who also joins the team to find justice for her people. As they embark on an adventure to find what is necessary to defeat Forge, the team finds themselves embroiled in Sofina’s much darker plan to take over Neverwinter and its people. 
It’s clear throughout the journey that each member of the gang possesses the skillful ability to bounce off one another’s energy. Perhaps that comes naturally with the well-written dialogue, particularly the banter that reflects each character’s personality, but the performances are still commendable. There are a substantial number of laugh-out-loud moments, and the best part is that there’s something for everyone: physical comedy, comparatively subtler witty humor and flat-out weird images — one of them being a formidably chunky dragon. 
Later on in the film, our heroes are thrown into the High Sun Games, a maze in which they must avoid monsters and other potential threats. It’s exciting, fast-paced and the most visually magnetic way to see what each member of the crew brings to the table, literally. 
If being weird means thinking outside the box in a way that wows people, then “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” shows that being weird is a positive trait. It embraces its weirdness. More than that, it actively invests in being different and unexpected in the most appealing sense possible. 
Creating a crew for an epic adventure often entails archetypes of characters to round out the members. The same can be said for any role-playing game like D&D. After all, there has to be something for everyone, a character that each person can relate to. At their worst, these archetypes can end up falling flat. 
For the most part, the film manages to avoid such issues by exaggerating the archetypes to the point where they’re deliberate. At one point, Doric asks Edgin what exactly he brings to the team. In that question lies the notion that everyone in the team is fulfilling some type/function of some sort. Holga is the strong warrior, Simon is the magician and Doric is the spying shapeshifter. Edgin, on the other hand, suffers from the fate of being the heroic but otherwise lacking main character. He can only respond with the fact that he makes plans. 
Still, it’s obvious that the acknowledgement of those tropes was difficult to maneuver. In the filmmakers’ struggle to condense the many traits they wanted into individual characters, oftentimes, the resulting characters become too simplistic. Because they are all intended to be archetypes of some sort, it feels like the filmmakers’ attempt to shovel in backstory, particularly for Edgin, is meant to compensate for this absence without much else to convey these characters’ identities. 
Watching the film feels like going on a theme park ride. No surprise: The story and scenes are that exhilarating. Sometimes, it does feel like audiences are getting mechanically shuffled from one plot point to another, but the ride never slows. “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is a roller coaster, with steep drops where they need to happen. 
What makes an epic adventure film great isn’t so much its scope, but the stakes of the mission and the heart of the team who are attempting to achieve it. There is so much heart in the film, and one gets the sense that it was lovingly crafted by people who love the core of the quest and are adventurers at heart. With this adaptation, the game has leapt off the table and into the world where it belongs.

USC holds a reputation as an expensive school of pervasive wealth. It is the sixth most expensive college in the United States, ranking first in the same category among California colleges. Ivy League universities, which compete with USC to attract the nation’s top applicants, also feature in that top 20. 
With USC levying another 5% increase in tuition fees — as well as imposing a mandatory $93 transportation fee on all students — to bring the total cost of tuition up to $66,640 for the 2023-24 academic year, that reputation is likely to stay for the time being. Students such as Odalys Molina Martinez, a sophomore majoring in business administration, have voiced their desire for greater transparency about where those additional funds are going.
“I personally would like to know [where the extra tuition is going],” Martinez said. “I think most of my friends would also like to know, considering we generally know where our tuition is going into, of course, paying for classes and all that stuff; but we don’t really know why it costs 90k to attend USC. Knowing where their money would go would be very beneficial.”
Additional costs for essential services such as housing, dining and transportation have inflated the expected cost of attendance by more than $5,000 to a total of $90, 921. It reflects a concerning time for students facing spiraling costs everywhere in an inflationary economy. The University pointed out that this inflation is spawning higher tuition costs around the country.
“Like other universities across the country, inflation is impacting our costs,” USC wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan March 8. “Tuition is the largest source of the university’s academic operating budget, which pays for teaching, student services and administrative support.”
Inflation currently sits at 6%, well above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%. Among those Ivy League universities that have revealed their tuition fees for the upcoming academic year — Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania and Yale University — the cost of studying is also set to increase by a range of 4% to 5% from 2022-23. 
Higher education institutions across the country are facing tightening revenue streams. USC faces a similar predicament, as its endowment has fallen 7.3% to $7.32 billion as of June. The University is expected to incur extra costs in labor union renegotiations with USC shuttle drivers and dispatchers and with graduate student workers.
Martinez, who is from a low-income background, said she was eager to learn about what this might mean for her financial aid package. Combined with the increased sticker price for attending the University, Martinez said that she, “like many others, [is] very afraid of how our financial aid packages will look like this upcoming school year.”
Despite the worsening economic trends, the University wrote in its statement that the “undergraduate financial aid pool is expected to increase 7 percent” from the $814 million awarded during the 2022-23 academic year. While not a final figure, it suggests that USC will not cut down on financial aid packages, although it is unclear if they will go unaffected entirely.
“Financial aid packages are not out yet, so I think that will really dictate if inflation has really hit us or not,” Martinez said.
The increased costs have not just manifested in tuition fees alone. Students will also be made to pay a new $93 transportation fee, which the University claims will offset rising costs related to the USC Lyft program.
Despite service being expanded from 16 hours a week to 56 since its launch in 2016, the reintroduction of a shared rides policy — colloquially referred to as “Shryft” — in January was met with criticism and anger from students over safety, efficacy and pay. Martinez said one of the reasons she came to USC was “knowing that the free Lyft program was already included” in the tuition she was charged.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu, Undergraduate Student Government president-elect and vice-president-elect respectively, reaffirmed this point as a platform to ask for greater transparency.
“We want to work towards a safer model of free Lyft,” Jakatdar said. “I guess it’s about $32 to $34 million cheaper per year for the University to do the shared Lyft model instead, but the real question is: Where does that go? And are there other sources of funding or is there anywhere else that we can draw that money from to ensure that an issue that students care about so much is addressed?”
The rise in the cost to attend college is set to hinder students from lower-income families the most, as they are least likely to absorb it. Among the resources available to USC students at risk of food, housing and financial insecurity is Student Basic Needs. Jakatdar said that, to achieve their goals on increasing resources for the Student Basic Needs department, “USC needs to become more accessible and more affordable to a greater student body and the students that need more resources to make ends meet.”
She claimed that while she and Lu worked “very closely” with Student Basic Needs, there was “one full-time employee for the last few months.”
Compared to UC Berkeley’s Basic Needs Center, which has seven full-time staffers on top of 34 student staffers who are paid a stipend, Jatakdar said the one employee that USC’s Student Basic Needs has is “just not enough to make up for the amount of students who are relying on the resources that they provide.”
Martinez said she believes the increase in tuition fees remains unjustified considering the fees it has paid for other programs, including USC Football Head Coach Lincoln Riley’s reported $110 million deal.
“Knowing that USC has that much money, I feel that USC shouldn’t be taking advantage of students, especially when we all know that inflation is rising and that not all of us are adjusted correctly to it,” Martinez said.

Jaden Armond applied to USC later than most. When decision day came, she was pleasantly surprised that she ended up being accepted — especially when many of her peers were not.
“When decisions came out, I was in this group chat and everyone was waitlisted [or] denied,” said Armond, a high school senior from Louisiana. “I was like, ‘Oh, I’m gonna go check my portal.’ Probably like everyone else was waitlisted or or denied, but when I saw the balloons and the congratulations, I was definitely like, ‘Oh my god.’” 
Armond was one of 8,032 first-year applicants — 9.9% of the total — admitted to the Class of 2027, after an admissions cycle that saw the debut of an early action phase, record-breaking application numbers and the first acceptance rate under 10% in the University’s history. 
Twenty-three percent of this year’s admitted applicants identified as first-generation students, compared to last year’s 20%. A third of admitted students are from racial or ethnic groups that are historically underrepresented in United States higher education, a ratio that Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold, in an interview with the Daily Trojan Monday, said has been gradually trending upward over the last few years. 
Armond applied to USC through QuestBridge, a nonprofit that helps low-income students apply to and afford top colleges in the U.S. Armond said being a person of color and low-income is very important to her life story. As an incoming English creative writing major, Armond made sure that her applications conveyed this story, and she recommends future applicants do the same. 
“When I did my essays, I talked a lot about where I grew up, how certain factors have influenced my life,” she said. “It wasn’t just more about making myself look good in terms of academics … It was more about telling my story, because your story is something that’s unique. You’re the only person who has your story.” 
While Armond said she has other options for college — she was accepted to Stanford University, Williams College and Pomona College, among others — USC is, at the moment, her top choice. 
“It’s just more now come down to the financial aid,” she said. “Once I receive it, I’ll be really evaluating whether or not I’ll be attending.” 
Eighty three percent of those admitted have unweighted GPAs that fall between a 3.8 and a 4.0 on a 4.0 scale, Brunold wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Monday. Nearly half earned straight As throughout high school.
Stephanie Plascencia, a senior at La Mirada High School, in La Mirada, California, is among the 38% of admits who attended a California high school. 
“It’s honestly a little bit surreal,” said Plascencia, who plans to major in biological sciences. “I feel like I’ve put in all my effort, and it just feels like a huge relief.” 
Plascencia first applied to USC for early action  — along with about half of this year’s applicants — but was deferred before being accepted in the regular decision pool. USC is currently her top choice. As a plus, she may be with her friends.
“There was only three of us that got in from the entire class and I was one of them,” Plascencia said. “My other two friends also got in.”
Gabriel Harris, a high school senior from American Canyon, California, plans to major in architecture and specialize in landscape architecture after finishing his undergraduate degree. 
“I learned about architecture and USC because of my godfather,” he said, “I first started mainly in environment art and, when I found out about my passion for architecture, I looked at landscape architecture. I said, ‘This is basically the same thing,’ so that’s where my passion came from.” 
Harris said USC is his top choice and he plans to commit shortly. 
“I screamed when I read the [acceptance] message,” he said. “My sister came in worried something was wrong and I told her the news and she screamed as well, and so I feel great. I’m just grateful that I was chosen. I know there’s so many applicants and I’m just glad that my application stood out.”
