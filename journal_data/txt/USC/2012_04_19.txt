The Women of Troy close out the regular season today in their last home match of the year, a nonconference matchup against Cal State Bakersfield, before heading into postseason play as the No. 3 seed in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference tournament.
The No. 3 women’s water polo team will have to try and claim victory against the Roadrunners without starting sophomore goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai, who’s currently competing for her home country of Hungary in an Olympic qualifying tournament in Italy.

That means senior goalie Morgan Vickers will get her first start of the season against the Roadrunners (22-15).
Vickers doesn’t lack experience, though: Before transferring to USC, she was the starting goalie for UC Irvine for two years, and this year, she has regularly assisted Bolonyai.
“I’m just looking forward to having fun,” Vickers said. “I’m not really getting nervous because I have done it before. I’ve played in big games. It’s fun.”
Sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist, USC’s leading scorer, doesn’t think the Women of Troy’s defense will slip against the Roadrunners with Vickers subbing for Bolonyai between the posts.
“We’re excited to have Morgan in the cage starting,” Gilchrist said. “It’ll be her last home game, so I think she’s really excited and she’ll have a good game.”
Today’s match is USC’s first in almost two weeks, and Vickers says they’ve been using that time to prepare for the MPSF tournament and that the match against the Roadrunners should only help.
“Tomorrow is a good warm-up for going into the MPSF tournament,” Vickers said. “Games are a good opportunity to learn the things that you still need to fix. We just want to make sure everything is perfect by the time we get up to Stanford for the MPSF [tournament].”
The Roadrunners boast junior two-meter Jessica Browning as their leading scorer with 72 goals, and like USC, are locked in as the No. 3 seed in their conference tournament next weekend.
The Women of Troy are 4-0 all-time against Cal State Bakersfield, with their last meeting in 2010 resulting in an 18-4 USC victory.
“We just have to stop their top players, play good defense and finish our opportunities on offense,” Gilchrist said. “We’re excited to play a game since it’s been so long. … I think we’re well-rested and ready to go.”

Roadwork began Monday to improve Ellendale Place between 29th Street and Adams Boulevard. Parking is not permitted along Ellendale Place from 6:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The City of Los Angeles is resurfacing the street, and construction is estimated to last four weeks.
Improvement · Repavement began on Ellendale Place on Monday as part of an L.A. City Council-approved project to improve streets throughout Los Angeles. The project is expected to last four weeks and to cost $300,000. - Chloe Stepney | Daily Trojan
The last time any maintenance was done on Ellendale Place was in 1986. The average life cycle of a residential street is 20 to 25 years, said Nazario Sauceda, director of the Bureau of Street Services for the City of Los Angeles.
Ellendale Place is one of many streets being identified by the city for improvements this year.
“The conditions of streets today are a result of historical underfunding,” Sauceda said. “It’s a monumental thing that our administration now is doing something to stop the deterioration of our streets.”
Cora Jackson-Fossett, director of public affairs for the L.A. Dept. of Public Works, said the improvements will benefit students and the surrounding community.
“This will reduce costs to automotive repairs and bring aesthetic calming to the community and noise reduction,” Jackson-Fossett said.
The street system in Los Angeles is the largest street network in the world and incorporates more than 70,000 city blocks. Using MicroPAVER, the city is able to analyze the condition of every street and to predict future conditions.
“Streets are a key component of the quality of life for residents,” Sauceda said. “Ellendale Place will not only improve conditions for cars, but also address livability, walkability and serviceability.”
USC bus stops on Ellendale are not accessible during construction. B Route stops can instead be accessed at 29th Street and Ellendale Place or Adams Boulevard and Ellendale Place.
The estimated cost of the project is $300,000.

The Office of Student Affairs and the consultant team for the USC Bicycle Master Plan presented a review of the planning process Thursday and outlined proposed solutions to bicycle congestion on campus, which includes the designation of specific bike lanes on campus.
Alison Kendall, a principle architect at Kendall Planning + Design, a firm hired in October to work with Student Affairs and the Dept. of Public Safety to help solve the ongoing issues related to bikes, spoke at the event held at Tommy’s Place.

“Basically, what we began is a systematic approach to looking at bikes on campus,” Kendall said. “Our general concept is to have certain roadways on campus that are marked by direction where it is safe [to ride a bike].”
Twenty-five percent of undergraduates have had a collision with a bicycle within the last year, Kendall said.
To increase safety on campus, the consultants suggest that separate bike lanes be created on all major roadways on campus, including McClintock Avenue, Trousdale Parkway, Downey Way and 34th Street.
“While not wanting to be overly restrictive, there is obviously a need to regulate,” Kendall said. “We need to develop a progressive enforcement approach.”
Consultants also presented plans to add more secure bike racks around campus, bike repair and services centers and a bike sharing and rental program as an alternative to owning a bike.
Kendall Planning + Design spoke to students and faculty , including 20 student and staff organizations, about the bike issues, and reviewed accident data involving bicycles on campus. The firm also looked at other universities, such as Stanford University that have implemented bike safety programs on their campuses.
About 200 people provided their input at the first bike summit on Jan. 18, and 2,000 people responded to an online survey about the bikes.
Consultants on the project also determined that most cyclists at USC are inexperienced.
“Many undergrad cyclists had never really biked before,” Kendall said. “As a result, they have a very limited understanding of how to bike in an urban setting.”
To remedy this issue, Kendall Planning + Design has suggested a program to educate cyclists at USC, which would potentially include classes on safety, bike tours around campus, videos offering biking tips and outreach from groups such as peer health educators, residential advisers and DPS.
Tom Studdert, director of orientation programs, said none of these plans have been finalized. USC administrators are set to discuss the plan at their meeting in early May.
“From there, an implementation plan will be developed. It’s not just an overnight process,” Studdert said.
Deike Peters, an adjunct assistant professor of urban planning, and graduate students from a Bike Planning Studio course in the Sol Price School of Public Policy also presented their specific research material and suggestions at the event. The students worked closely with Kendall Planning + Design on the project.
I’m glad USC has finally come to their senses by asking Stanford for help.
I’m kind of confused by the map.  It looks like pretty much every path on campus is designated as “possible”.  This indecision is inexcusable; this ain’t rocket science.
I think it’s inevitable that in the future the school will have more bikes on campus than it does today.  The USC campus is ideal for cyclists, with generally dry weather and flat topography.  Bike accidents need to be better prevented, especially when pedestrians are the victims, but this solution is half-baked.
All those “possible” paths should be made permanent.  Moreover, the actual bike paths need to be clearly separated from pedestrian paths.  Just do a Google Street View of Amsterdam (or anywhere in the Netherlands for that matter, including industrial zones) to see how this should look.  Ideally the bike path will be slightly submerged and a different color than the pedestrian path.
My discussions with DPS have exposed a not too subtle contempt on their behalf towards bikes (perhaps they should get rid of their segway/chariots and commit to bicycles themselves).  Beyond the paths, all buildings on campus need to better incorporate parking spots for bikes.  Whereas the southeastern corner of campus doesn’t have a crowding issue, the center and northwest corner surely do.
It’s great news that the school is addressing the bicycle issue but I fear the conclusions seem to skirt the heart of the matter.  Without encouraging bicycles more, the DPS contempt of bikes will persist.

Green dinosaurs have swept the campus in preparation of the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, much like the editorial cartoons drawn by Bob Staake did more than 30 years ago when he worked as a cartoonist for the Daily Trojan.
“I did five editorial cartoons a week,” Staake said. “Back in the day, the Daily Trojan used to encourage writers to do as much writing as possible. That’s what you do for the Los Angeles Times. That’s what you did for the Herald Examiner. That’s why I went to USC.”

Staake started drawing editorial cartoons as a student at West Orange High School in Torrance, Calif., and continued after graduating despite not attending a college with a newspaper. He said he was getting syndication offers, but his mentor at the Los Angeles Times told him he should further his education.
“I went to USC and said, ‘Look, can I at least go ahead and do editorial cartoons for you guys,’” he said. “I did that for about two years, not being a student, but hoping what would happen would be USC taking a notice in my stuff and giving me a scholarship.”
He eventually received a scholarship to major in journalism and international relations, and he continued drawing for the Daily Trojan. After leaving USC, he found work as a freelance illustrator. He has now been published in a diverse range of publications:  He has illustrated covers for The New Yorker and pages in MAD Magazine, has done animation for Cartoon Network and has had weekly illustrations in the Washington Post for the past 25 years.
“I understand that when [I] do a New Yorker cover, I come at it from a completely different perspective from when I go and do a page from MAD Magazine,” Staake said. “My ability to shift and do something new, that’s the key to my success.”

Staake has also illustrated several books and has found success as a children’s author, writing and illustrating his own books featuring a wide cast of characters, from a monster truck to White House dog Bo Obama. He said he tries to work with a wide variety of publishers to allow
him to further diversify his work.
“With every publisher, I try to do something different,” he said. “People will look at my books and say, ‘He was really prolific, and did a lot of work with a lot of different publishers, and he always did something really surprising.”
Not every image he sketches ends up in a book, such as the image of a dinosaur on the Empire State Building reading a book that he recently re-designed as a dinosaur on top of a stack of books to promote the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. Staake said one of his publishers, Random House, asked him to design art for the festival, but there was no question for him that the dinosaur was the right fit.
“The tradition of the whole show is just amazing and then I thought, ‘I’ve got this one image that I think is really perfect,’” he said. “To help out the Los Angeles Times and USC and publishing in any sort of small way, I’d give it up all day long. I’m honored that they would go ahead and have me do this.”
Staake will also speak on a panel about children’s books and sign art at the Los Angeles Times booth during the festival, marking his first return to campus since moving his studio to Chatham, Mass.
“I’m really looking forward to seeing the campus,” Staake said. “I want to go to the top of the Student Union and look down on Tommy Trojan.”
Though he never took a formal art class at USC, Staake said his work with the Daily Trojan and other courses were the most important preparation for his current career.
“What USC taught me was the ability to go ahead and think in a multidisciplinary manner, to understand the connection between discipline and art,” he said. “The art is simply a vehicle, and that is what the School of Journalism taught me. They gave me so much freedom to go for it.”
Kind of ironic that dinosaurs are extinct and they are the rep of the Book Festival?

Though the Trojans have blazed through the season without a single loss, their last match of the regular season holds the most importance.
Senior citizen · The No. 1 Trojans, led by a strong senior class that includes Daniel Nguyen, are looking to win a fourth straight national title. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The No. 1 Trojans (25-0, 6-0) will battle crosstown rivals No. 5 UCLA (20-2, 6-0) at Marks Tennis Stadium on Friday at 3 p.m. in the regular season finale that will determine who stands atop the Pac-12 Conference.
USC has amassed 45 consecutive wins since last February. In conference play, the Trojans have given up just four combined points to six total opponents, including the likes of No. 12 California and No. 11 Stanford.
“We’ve beaten a lot of good teams in the Pac-12, but UCLA is going to be our toughest matchup,” senior Daniel Nguyen said.
The Bruins have a lesser streak at nine in a row but have shown their mettle after posting a sweep over Cal on Saturday and a 6-1 win over Stanford the day after.
With both teams boasting perfect conference records, the winner will earn the top seed in the conference tournament, which begins Thursday.
As the final home match of the season, the contest will also serve as USC’s Senior Day, honoring seniors Ben Lankenau, Steve Johnson and Nguyen.
“It’s going to be a special moment. Against UCLA, for our Senior Day — it’ll leave a big impression,” Nguyen said. “It’ll be a crazy crowd, and I’m looking forward to the match.”
Nguyen and Johnson are ranked No. 17 and No. 2 in singles, respectively. Johnson currently leads the squad with 57 consecutive singles wins, a streak that began last January.
Right behind the two seniors are No. 23 sophomore Ray Sarmiento, No. 43 freshman Yannick Hanfmann, No. 50 sophomore Emilio Gomez and freshman Roberto Quiroz.
In doubles, USC will feature No. 3 pair Johnson and Quiroz and No. 25 pair Nguyen and Sarmiento. None of USC’s three doubles pairs have dropped a game since March 15.
On the other end, No. 21 Nick Meister, No. 61 Adrien Puget, No. 78 Clay Thompson and No. 86 Marcos Giron comprise the four ranked Bruins in singles. UCLA will also feature No. 41 duo Alex Brigham and Puget in doubles.
In their last matchup in February, USC came out on top 6-1 at the Los Angeles Tennis Center in a nonconference match. The Trojans are careful, however, not to let past results affect their mindset and gameplay.
“They’re a great team on any given day. We’ve fought battles with these guys in the past, and nothing comes easy,” Johnson said.
USC has not given up more than two points in a match since a 4-3 win over No. 3 Ohio State in February, but Johnson insists that the team’s focus remains more on the win and less on the numbers.
“I’m just hoping for a win. It would be something special to go out and sweep those guys,” Johnson said. “But they’re going to come ready to play, and they’re not going to mess around.”

Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak discussed his love of technology, and especially computers, at a Town Hall hosted by USC’s Academic Culture Assembly on Thursday.
“A computer sitting there unused was a crime to me,” Wozniak said.
Wozniak used any computer he could get his hands on — for anything from programming to pranks.
Tech · Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak spoke at an event sponsored by Academic Culture Assembly on Thursday about creating the Apple II. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
He said some of his favorite jokes included creating San Francisco’s first Dial-A-Joke hotline and calling the Vatican from a blue box he developed with Steve Jobs to make international calls for free.
Despite his love of fun, however, Wozniak said his passion for computers centered on deeper motives.
“My belief was there was a social revolution coming,” Wozniak said. “In education, kids were going to answer questions like out of a book and they were [going to] get graded instantly by a computer. They were going to be using 100 percent of their minds instead of 10 percent of their minds.”
His unwavering belief in the future of computers kept Wozniak dedicated to developing electronics.
“My life was electronics,” he said. “I’d go in to work [at Hewlett Packard] and design electronics all day, then I would go home and have a TV dinner and watch Star Trek, and then what would I do? More electronics.”
This obsession with perfecting digital electronics led Wozniak to develop several projects on his own. He built a home version of the arcade game Pong, created the programming that output the first colors to computer screens and launched the Apple II with Jobs.
Wozniak said his and Jobs’ differences allowed them to work well together.
“He was a little more counterculture, a little more hippie than I was. I admired him for it,” Wozniak said. “But I just loved the word revolution.”
Some of Wozniak’s favorite memories were the days in Apple’s infancy, when it all felt very much like a revolution.
“I liked the startup days, where you were just talking with friends about all these grand ideas. When it becomes a huge company, it just runs itself.”
He still kept a small share in Apple to remain on the payroll and now Wozniak is the only person who has been involved in the company from the beginning.
Looking forward, Wozniak said the same desire he had to improve computers in Apple’s early days motivates him today.
“I always want my machines more and more to understand my human thoughts,” Wozniak said. “But it needs smell. I’m convinced that it is not a human until it can smell me.”
Students in the audience said hearing about Wozniak’s experience was motivating.
“It’s always been a dream of mine to start a business and the experience and wisdom he shared tonight was inspiring,” said Will Roper, a junior majoring in economics.
Others said listening to Wozniak discuss his passion for technology changed their perspective on the field.
“I was on the fence about coming because I’m not a big Apple person, but I am very glad I did because I learned a lot about technology,” said Shaina Eng, a sophomore majoring in public relations.
For all his love for technology, Wozniak closed by reminding the audience the real significance of computers is how people use them.
“It doesn’t do much good to think of something new and great if it doesn’t get to people,” Wozniak said.

The No. 3 women’s golf team wrapped up the regular season on a strong note, finishing second at the second annual Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Tournament Tuesday in Half Moon Bay, Calif.
The Women of Troy finished at 9-under 855, six strokes behind UCLA, who recorded a final score of 15-under 849 to win the tournament. Stanford finished third at 4-over 868, while Arizona came in a stroke behind at 869 to finish fourth.

The Women of Troy entered the final round 14 strokes behind the Bruins, but a strong final push allowed the team to narrow the margin and take second.
Senior Lisa McCloskey finished second overall at 6-under 210, a season best and her highest mark in the last two seasons. Senior Inah Park also notched a personal high, finishing tied for 3rd at 2-under 214. Sophomore Rachel Morris and freshman Doris Chen each finished tied for 28th at 4-over 220, while sophomore Sophia Popov concluded tied for 59th at 13-over 229.
The tournament saw some highs and lows for the Women of Troy. McCloskey steadily improved each round, following up a 71 and 70 on the first two rounds with a 3-under 69 on the final 18. She birdied two of the final three holes and notched her second straight bogey-free round, completing her sixth top 10 finish of the year.
After an even first round and a 3-over 75 on the second day, Park shot an impressive 5-under 67 to finish tied for third. Both matched season highs for the senior, who recorded six birdies on the day. Morris shot a 3-over 75 on the first 18 and a 1-over 73 on the second day before a final round even-72. Her four birdies, including two of the final three holes, propelled to her best final round and overall finish of the season.
Chen also notched four birdies in the final round, shooting a 2-under 70 after a rough middle round of 6-over 78. Popov, whose sophomore season has been hampered by injury and inconsistency, struggled to find her groove during the tournament, twice shooting 8-over 80 between a middle round 3-over 75.
After winning four tournaments last year, the Women of Troy were unable to replicate such success this year, capturing only one tournament victory. However, the spring season marked a steady improvement for the team, especially after a troublesome fall campaign.
“The team, as well as myself, didn’t perform to our usual standards, and therefore we haven’t been performing to our full potential,” Popov said. “Personally, the end of my regular season was disappointing and I’m hoping to fix things before the postseason starts.”
However, Popov remains optimistic that the team can achieve a semblance of its old self during the playoffs.
“As we’ve seen today, if we all play our best golf, we are capable of doing really well in the postseason,” Popov said.
The Women of Troy will kick off the postseason with the Pac-12 Championships, to be held in Pullman, Washington April 27 to 29.

Tony Ciarelli has become the second Trojan in history to be named the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation men’s volleyball Player of the Year. The senior outside hitter makes it two years in a row for the Trojans after Murphy Troy took home the award in 2011.
Best in the west · Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli was named the conference player of the year Thursday for his efforts this season. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Additionally, setter Micah Christenson has been named MPSF Freshman of the Year, giving the No. 1 Trojans a sweep of the two major awards. Christenson and senior middle blocker Steven Shandrick were named to the All-MPSF second team, while redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Tanner Jansen, sophomore libero Henry Cassiday and freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers were named All-MPSF honorable mentions. Feathers was also named to the All-MPSF Freshman team.
Ciarelli was named MPSF Player of the Week three times in 2012 and he is currently top in the nation in blocks per game (.60) and tied for fourth in kills per game (4.03). He also set a MPSF record when he had 11 aces in the Trojans’ sweep over Long Beach State last week.
Christenson has quickly become one of the nation’s top setters coming out of Hawaii, as he is tied for fourth in the nation in assists per game with 10.92. Feathers has also been valuable to the Trojans as a freshman, and set a USC record with 135 total blocks while leading the nation with 1.67 blocks per game.
Cassiday is ranked 17th nationally in digs per game (2.23), Shandrick is tied for 20th in blocks per game (1.08) and Jansen is second on the team behind only Ciarelli in kills per game (2.82) and is hitting .288.

In its season finale, the USC women’s tennis team travels up the freeway to Westwood to face off against No. 1 UCLA in a showdown of the Pac-12’s top teams.
A win for the No. 4 Women of Troy (19-3, 6-1) could mean a possible Pac-12 title. The top-ranked Bruins have beaten the Women of Troy twice this season, but defeating a team three times in one year is no easy feat.
UCLA (21-1, 8-1) almost reached this point in the season with an unblemished record, but California defeated the Bruins last Friday in Westwood before Cal fell to the Women of Troy the following day.
In what has been an amazing year in terms of depth in the Pac-12, both UCLA and USC have shown an ability to fight through the conference and remain a top team in the nation.
The Bruins first beat the Women of Troy in the semifinal match during the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Indoor Championship in North Carolina, a tournament that UCLA won. On March 1, USC fell to the Bruins at home in a 4-3 heartbreaker that had the look of a postseason match.
In fact, the Women of Troy have not beaten UCLA in the past two seasons with their last victory being at home in 2009.
USC faces a tough task trying to take down the Bruins on Friday, especially when you consider that all six of the Bruins’ players are ranked nationally.
Heading UCLA’s singles is freshman Robin Anderson, who ranks third in the nation and poses a very serious threat to fellow freshman Zoë Scandalis on court 1.
Though there’s a precipitous drop-off for UCLA after first singles with No. 96 McCall Jones, the second-highest-ranked player on the squad, by no means does that abstain the Women of Troy from a gritty, tough Bruins team.
Jones usually moves around the rotation and can be seen playing anywhere form court 2 to court 4 on Friday. Following Jones is Skylar Morton, Pamela Montez, Chanelle Van Nguyen and Kaitlyn Ray, all of whom rank from No. 107 to No. 118.
Junior Danielle Lao will have to be at her finest for the Women of Troy since a singles point from her goes a long way to building momentum within the match.
The freshmen — Scandalis, Sabrina Santamaria and Gabriella DeSimone — need to play at their usual high levels and show the maturity they have shown all season long. Though this is just one match, a win for Scandalis would be a nice boost of confidence for a freshman who has taken a beating on court 1 all year.
Battling against teams’ top players day in and day out has an adverse effect, both mentally and physically, and a win on court 1 would be monumental not just for this match but in the grand scheme of things.
For the Women of Troy, Friday is a battle for revenge, a grudge match of sorts, as this traditional rivalry among two of the nation’s powerhouses always comes with great pressure and excitement. USC has a possible Pac-12 riding on this game, but moreso a victory will be a great confidence booster with the NCAA tournament in sight.

I always wanted to attend USC. Growing up in a family of USC alumni, I was born with cardinal and gold blood. I knew the Fight Song like my ABCs. I was destined to be a Trojan.
Yes, I had always heard about the Trojan Family, the connections and everything my parents and relatives had lived, breathed and experienced during their time here. It had seemed like it was just a matter of time until this school would eventually be my home.
The old cliché is to follow your dreams, and USC was my dream school. Of course, I always dreamed of playing in the NBA because I knew what it felt like to be “In The Zone” back in my childhood days. That dream, though, ended in high school. And now my college career is winding down.
But for thousands of students around the world, it’s a crucial time of the year — finals are coming upon us, summer is around the corner and a new beginning awaits next fall for prospective college freshmen.
For those of you graduating high school and for parents of high school seniors, I understand there is some uneasiness about choosing USC — especially with the recent events of the last two weeks.
But before making a rash decision based on these incidents, think about all the great things the campus has to offer.
What embodies the Trojan spirit, what embodies the Trojan Family can be found when looking to our football and basketball programs this last year for some guidance and inspiration.
Winning on the gridiron is pretty much expected for Trojan football. It seemed like an eternity that former coach Pete Carroll’s squads ruled the collegiate football landscape. Fast-forward to summer 2009 when the NCAA laid down the law. That destroyed my hopes of ever attending a bowl game as a student.
And there was certainly disappointment. But last season, experiencing and watching a team bond was something special. Who can ever forget the Oregon game that capped off the season?
As for our basketball program, it’s been a little different. There would be no postseason during my first year at this school because of self-imposed sanctions. There was a swift exit from the NCAA tournament the following year.
Last season was arguably one of the most frustrating sights to watch. Players kept getting injured. The losses kept coming. But if there’s anything to take away from the group of young men competing on the hardwood night in and night out, it’s their heart and character.
These two athletic programs made the most of what they had. They were dealt a hand that certainly wasn’t too favorable. There was overreaction from even the most loyal fans and probably unjustified scrutiny. Nobody thought the football team would emerge as one of the top teams in the nation last fall. On the other end of the spectrum, nobody believed the basketball team would suffer as tough a season this year. But it never mattered — not to the players, at least. They fought, they clawed and they battled.
In spite of hardships, there was always a light at the end of the tunnel. The Trojan Family and the Trojan bond are stronger than whatever else might try tearing us down.
If there is one thing that can be gleaned from my time as a USC student, it’s this: Always remember to fight on.

The long, winding and exciting road of the regular season is finally over for the USC men’s volleyball team. The postseason is here.
Riding a 17-match winning streak, the top-ranked and first-seeded Trojans (22-4, 18-4) will begin their quest for a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title Saturday night when they host eighth-seeded Cal State Northridge (12-17, 8-14) in the tournament quarterfinals.
Streakers · Freshman outside hitter Austin Rysyk and the Trojans have won 17 straight matches and are the top seed in the MPSF tournament. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans should have little trouble remembering these opponents, as they closed their regular season last Saturday by sweeping the Matadors in Northridge.
Though a top-five showdown looms in the semifinals against the winner of the UCLA/UC Irvine match, the Trojans are continuing with a match-by-match mindset and have put all their focus into practice this week, aiming to avoid a first-round upset.
The Trojans have been especially effective lately in getting off to strong starts and using that early momentum to propel them to victory.
The team has won the first set by six points or more in seven of its last nine matches, all wins.
“It’s all attributed to our mental focus when we step out on the court,” senior co-captain and middle blocker Steve Shandrick said. “We realize that you can’t ease into the game because, if you do, your opponent is going to step on you.”
USC coach Bill Ferguson credited this beneficial trend in large part to the Trojans’ other senior captain, outside hitter Tony Ciarelli.
“Lots of guys take time … to work their way into the match before they can be effective. Tony has the unique ability to be really good right off the bat,” Ferguson said.
As the postseason begins, the team will turn to Ciarelli and Shandrick for the pair’s veteran savviness and postseason experience.
“Tony does a great job of keeping us focused and tense on the court during the match while Steve does a really good job of being the lead-by-example guy,” Ferguson said. “They work off each other very well, so we’re going to need their experience and leadership when things aren’t going our way so much.”
After being the heavy favorites in the MPSF tournament last year, the Trojans enter this conference tournament as the favorites once again.
USC’s path should be more difficult this time around, as they face heavy competition from the No. 2-No. 5 seeds.
All five squads, the Trojans included, were within one game of each other in conference play before the Trojans pulled away on the final night of the regular season.
“Last year it was us and everybody else,” Ferguson said. “This year, five teams can win this thing.”
Though the two captains have been invaluable to the team’s rousing success, there have also been contributions from players outperforming most preseason expectations.
Shandrick praised freshman setter Micah Christenson for his high level of play this season.
“He’s been very mature coming in as a freshman and being the setter for this team,” Shandrick said. “I think he’s shown tremendous leadership.”
Ferguson, on the other hand, gave credit to redshirt junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski.
“He’s been in the program for three years, had some nicks and bruises, but he’s done a phenomenal job to be such a big part of what we’re doing,” Ferguson said. “Even when statistically he’s not great, he’s almost always doing something positive for us. He always brings something to the table.”
Everything in order for a trip to the ncaa championship game on May 5th with home court throughout the
playoffs. This is it, now or who knows when after Ciarelli and Shandrick leave the program following the
departure of Murphy Troy, Riley McKibbin, Tri Bourne, and Austin Zahn a year ago with no banner to hang
at Galen Ctr. Surprised myself that this team turned out so well. Must keep the focus going because it appears
a 22 game winning streak will be needed to claim the ultimate goal except for a loss in the conference final
which will guarantee a trip to the final four.
Agree. Great article. Micah mature as setter. Mo great efforts always. TONY da MAN!!!
Shamrock Shandrick great leader by example & getting very consistent. Feathers amazing at MB as blocking leader in nation as Frosh.  McKibbin can do it all and he’s left handed….really picks team up when he comes in.
Tanner also giving big hits…..Do not forget Henry Cassidy and those impossile Digs….
Fight On.  Going to be a fun post season…

On a chilly February night in Little Tokyo, a 6-foot-5 man armed with a spray paint can stands back to survey his work. Bubbles, paint drips, swooping lines and gazing eyes now cover two tall pillars in front of Hold Up Art, an art gallery that sits amid a cluster of small stores on Second Street.
For decades, Vyal One, or Vyal for short, has filled the city streets with similar works, which all retain his trademark dark, highly detailed style. Vyal settled on his name in the 1990s; he considered other monikers, but the idea initially originated from the associations of his works with evil and darkness.
Goodnight moon · Noteworthy street artist Vyal One experiments with graffiti art in his exuberant, highly detailed “Concrete Smile.” - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Fast-forward to the present: Vyal’s work appears in everything from Warner Bros. Records’ art show Vinyl Revisionists to a commission by Neiman Marcus for an event celebrating fashion designer Christian LouBoutin. Vyal’s most recent undertaking, Visceral Rituals, opened Saturday at Hold Up Art.
The show comes eight years after his first solo show and despite his street and gallery credentials, Vyal admits his insecurity resulted in the long break.
“I know graffiti, and when it’s on a wall it’s cool and it makes sense and people don’t necessarily have to pay money to validate it,” Vyal said. “But once you put your work on canvas, you automatically start a process in your head: You think it’s only good if it sells, [and] that naturally starts playing into the whole equation.”
Despite that, the pieces in Visceral Rituals haven’t particularly changed or conformed to meet any specific expectations, regardless of their placement within a formal gallery setting.
“My art is my art,” Vyal said. “So really it’s the gallery that has to be aware of my work and they have to be able to be confident and back my work up 100 percent.”
Vyal’s artistic process also focuses on encouraging a natural, unforced creative flow. He does not sketch out his designs, and instead first envisions a certain atmosphere or effect to pursue. Painting his way through artist’s block and producing pieces as frequently as possible, Vyal continues to develop and explore his style.
Some of the most notable features in Vyal’s pieces are images of bubbles and eyes, the latter holding many important meanings to him. Vyal already sports a fascination with circles — which explains all the bubbles present in his works — but the specific focus on eyes comes from various reasons, among them his views on the sense of sight.
“I’m very thankful for the fact that I can open my eyes every day and see the things I see,” Vyal said. “We enjoy our senses, but we don’t think about them and we don’t give them the praise I think they deserve. Sight for me as an artist is the highest sense I can have, so I try to pay homage to it every time I paint.”
Though much of his work seems stylistically and thematically dark, many pieces also contain a sense of humor, something that mirrors Vyal’s thoughts on his personality.
“I’m a big clown. I love to laugh — I’m really standoffish at first, but once people get to know me, I’ll let my guard down,” Vyal said. “Being 6-foot-5 and looking like [a] Native American undertaker, people get intimidated.”
Visceral Rituals only reveals more about the artist’s complex personality, and the pieces each have something intriguing to say about his outlook. The title hints at some of the exhibit’s themes, but Vyal leaves much of the interpretation of his work to the viewers.
“I kind of stay within these confines of characters and stuff for the most part but now I’ve been doing these weird — I want to call them landscapes, but they’re not really landscapes — bubbles and lines and abstract pieces,” Vyal said. “The title of the show [is] open to interpretation and [stays] vague, but at the same time [is] totally about who I am as an artist and as a painter.”
Whether in a gallery or on the street, Vyal’s work forces people to look closely and give more than just a glance to street art.
In some cases the work eyes you right back.

L!fe Happens has the promise of delivering the next Bridesmaids or Sex and the City message of comedic woman empowerment, but falters and only empowers audience members who are against the idea of single motherhood.

With Los Angeles as the backdrop, the film perpetuates the negative personas of the city, and female archetypes in general, in each of the three roommates at the film’s core. Deena’s (Kate Bosworth) “bone-and-bolt” policy is paramount to her attitude that everything is inferior to herself and her own success. Kim (Krysten Ritter) suffers from Peter Pan syndrome and isn’t ashamed of her choices, only the consequences. Laura (Rachel Bilson) is the wholesome, naive, do-anything-to-get-ahead type who pays little regard to the fact that working as a naked sushi serving plate demeans women.
Directed by Kat Coiro, L!fe Happens follows the standard formula of a group of friends trying to figure out how to leave their mark on the world — but with a twist. One of them has an unplanned baby.
Thankfully, the plot skips from the opening scene of best friends Kim and Deena arguing over who should get the last condom — stealing a five-minute section of a 1996 episode of Friends to make an entire movie — to the two friends driving around Los Angeles one year later with Kim’s baby.
If the pregnancy had been included in the movie, it is entirely likely that Kim’s escapades would have included binge drinking and smoking, making her character even less likable and the movie’s runtime longer than the barely manageable hour and 40 minutes.
The film’s supporting cast is its only redeeming quality. Anyone who’s ever hated their boss can relate to Kim’s ultra-obnoxiuos employer, Francesca, played by Kristen Johnson. Francesca’s over-the-top antics are the accumulation of Kim’s frustrations of her dead-end lifestyle. Francesca strings Kim along on the most ridiculous business opportunity ever created for a movie, a doggie mall, and keeps Kim busy walking dogs and managing her charitable dog-related events. This in turn lets Kim wallow in self-pity and insecurities that keep her from making her life, and worse, her baby’s, any better.
After securing a girls night out, Kim meets Nicholas (Geoff Stults) and after a misunderstanding where she thinks he hates children, she lies about having a son and says that the child is her roommate Deena’s. This leads to Kim having to make more elaborate, unnecessary lies.
If she was looking for a one-night-stand, why bother investing in a lie at all? If she was looking for a relationship, how meaningful could the relationship be if it started on that harsh of a lie? Either way, the plot hole is huge and unresolved throughout the film’s and the characters’ growth.
“We just realized that’s the story we wanted to tell, about young girls, figuring out who they are and trying to have it all, but also when you throw a baby in the mix, it creates a whole other set of challenges,” Ritter said in a recent Collider.com interview.
This lazy attitude toward having a baby is one of the many flaws in the storyline. For instance, in the supposed happy ending, Kim ignores the financial responsibilities to her child and quits her job — the only stable part of her life — and then relies on her father’s retirement fund to move out of her shared house with two roommates into her own one-bedroom home in an L.A. suburb.
The audience is supposed to overlook this moral discrepancy for the sake of character development. Kim stops relying on everyone around her to raise her child, keeping her child a secret from anyone willing to buy her a drink at a bar and tries to grow up.
Unfortunately, sitting through L!fe Happens will make the audience feel sorry for no one other than Kim’s baby.

With the school year coming to a close, students are in the midst of the stresses of final projects and exams, all the while fully aware that the allure of summer is within their grasp. That means internships, jobs, vacations and hopefully taking advantage of the bustling concert circuit.
Summer marks a time when the biggest tours get rolled out, often with many bands and artists partnering up to draw larger crowds and make the experience just a little bit more special. It also means plenty of outdoor shows and festivals that will take advantage of the nice weather.
And this summer offers some of the biggest names in the industry, many of whom are returning after long absences. But from the looks of it, this summer will keep music fans busy from beginning to end.
The Beach Boys are back and going on a 50-year anniversary reunion tour that kicks off Tuesday in Tucson, Ariz., and continues through the end of July. The tour will see three of the iconic group’s founding members, Mike Love, Al Jardine and Brian Wilson, touring together for the first time in 46 years.
As if a Beach Boys reunion tour isn’t enough for fans, there is also a new album in the works, meaning concert goers might potentially hear new material this summer in addition to the band’s extensive back catalogue. After all, Love and Jardine have been known to play up to 40 songs each night, so fans will certainly get their money’s worth at these shows.
Another summer staple is returning this year, too. Dave Matthews Band, a go-to favorite among high school and college crowds, will embark on a summer tour across the U.S. much to the delight of fans who were deprived of a big tour last year.
Fans of the group can expect multiple-night standings at amphitheaters around the country from May to September with strong support from the like of The Avett Brothers, Fitz and the Tantrums and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.
Make note, Dave Matthews Band is known for amping up its spontaneity during extensive sets, so expect some interesting improvisation during big hits such as “Crash into Me.”
Perhaps the biggest tour of the summer belongs to the classic rock genre, though. The simply titled “The Tour” will unite Mötley Crüe and KISS to share the stage for the first time in 30 years — expect it to be one of the most explosive shows of the season.
Whether or not you are a fan of the groups, these two acts are notorious for pyrotechnics and special effects, and will likely create a blazing inferno and an unforgettable fireworks show.
Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee performed a drum solo upside down on a roller coaster loop last summer, if that is any indication of what to expect from the band this year.
KISS will play last each night and the tour will stop in Irvine, Calif., at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater on Aug. 14.
Finally, any forecast of what to expect from summer concerts would not be complete without mentioning the Vans Warped Tour. Affectionately known as punk rock summer camp, this tour, now in its 18th year, will feature some of the biggest names in the alternative, punk and rock genres.
Acts such as Taking Back Sunday, New Found Glory, Rise Against, All Time Low and Yellowcard will perform on the main stage. There will also be at least six other stages featuring more than 90 artists throughout the course of the tour, which will stop in Irvine, Pomona, Ventura and Chula Vista, Calif., in June.
Warped Tour is simply an event that a person has to experience at least once. There are slip ’n slides, meet and greets with artists, loads of free stuff, skate demos and non-stop music for about nine hours. It’s a hot, sweaty celebration of music that never lets up for a second and leaves patrons sunburned with memories for weeks to come. Just be prepared for omnipresent mosh pits and tons of people running around advertising free hugs.
Aside from famous bands and large-scale festivals, summer 2012 will also feature many smaller-scale summer tours from bands like Reel Big Fish and Eve 6 which will be performing at clubs around the country.
Touring has become the most important source of income for an artist in the wake of rampant digital downloads, so acts are trying to create the best live experience possible to draw in the biggest crowds — and summer is the best time of year to do so.
No matter what genre of music one prefers, there are bound to be plenty of options to take advantage of this summer. It might be worth it to stop lounging poolside or watching reruns and get out there to experience the traveling circus of a live show.

On Monday, the Senate defeated the Buffett Rule, a tax proposal that asked the wealthiest Americans to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes.
The proposal’s moniker alone indicated the dire need for such a measure. Its namesake, billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, made a personal plea to Congress in August to “stop coddling the super-rich.” He pointed out that his secretary paid a higher federal tax rate than he did.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Buffett is right to see this as a glaring injustice. How do the rich end up with more tax breaks?
The simplest answer is that the rich tend not to make money in the same way most Americans do. The standard payroll tax only affects a small part of their income, while the vast profits they make from stocks, real estate speculation and other large-scale investments are sometimes left nearly untouched.
Many of America’s wealthiest persons, including Buffett and presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, make the majority of their money by the latter means. Thus, they get away with tax rates as low as 13.9 percent (Romney’s rate in 2010) while those in the middle range of taxpayers pay an average of 16 percent in taxes.
Republicans argue that high tax rates, particularly on the rich, hurt the economy by interfering with American laissez-faire capitalism. In reality, the ways the rich earn their money have the greatest potential to damage the natural market forces that make capitalism possible.
Large-scale corporate monetary operations, such as banking and big investments, allow for what is essentially a legal counterfeiting process.
For example, banks loan out a large portion of customers’ money as soon as it is deposited. When customers return to their bank to withdraw a large chunk of their cash, they get it — but now their funds have been doubled. The borrower gets the original, and the customer gets a hastily crafted copy. Because banks are not limited by a fixed amount of hard currency, they do not immediately need to account for the extra, invented funds.
Investment might be a good way to encourage cash flow, but it does not directly bolster the American economy. It does not lead to a product or a service and it does not create jobs.
That doesn’t mean investments are evil or unethical, but it does mean the government must find ways to tax investments and put them to good use in federal programs.
The proposal of the Buffett Rule came at a time when, as President Barack Obama said in his speech Tuesday at Florida Atlantic University, “The share of our national income flowing to the top 1 percent has climbed to levels last seen in the 1920s.”
Let us not forget the sickening decadence that was the tail of the Gilded Age: lavish parties, massive ballrooms illuminated with electric lights and summer homes with 20-foot ceilings and 30 rooms.
The Buffett Rule was not only just — it was practical. Congress might have failed  to make it a top priority, but in deciding between Obama and Romney, voters would do well to keep it in mind.

“Investment might be a good way to encourage cash flow, but it does not directly bolster the American economy. It does not lead to a product or a service and it does not create jobs.”
Ms. Bessey, I encourage you to drop narrative studies and come to the USC economics department instead. You grossly misunderstand banking and investment.
Well said.
yes. and just watch inside job everyone!
Let us also not forget the incredible philanthropy of the gilded age that used private money to endow thousands of colleges, hospitals, museums, academies, schools, opera houses, public libraries, symphony orchestras, and charities.

A February Associated Press poll showed that nearly 67 percent of Americans favor a law, often referred to as the Buffett Rule, which would set a minimum income tax rate of 30 percent on all households earning $1 million or more annually.
The Buffett Rule prompted the proposal of similar legislation: a minimum income tax rate of 30 percent for all households earning $2 million or more per year. On Monday, Senate Republicans blocked the measure — and for good reason.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Unless we want to move even further from the free-market values that have allowed America to flourish, we must continue to oppose the Buffett Rule as an affront to justice and fairness.
Ironically, President Barack Obama promoted the Buffett Rule on the idea that it espouses “fairness.” He believes for Americans to have access to quality education and infrastructure, the rich must be taxed more; they must pay for what he perceives as the common good.
Such an idea could not be further from the truth.
America has been successful largely because people have been duly rewarded for their hard work. Obama’s redistributionist measures would essentially punish taxpayers who have lawfully benefited from the fruits of their labor. They would stifle the creativity and the burning desire for success that have characterized this country since its inception.
Democrats emphasize that revising tax codes based on the Buffett Rule would raise $47 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, revenue that could be used to reduce the federal deficit. But such an amount would barely put a dent in the nearly $16-trillion deficit that currently plagues our nation.
Plus, revenue from the Buffett Rule is ultimately a side issue. What is really at stake here is the fundamental value of fairness that Obama referred to. Instead of promoting and sustaining fairness, such revisions of the tax code would stomp on it by sending the message that working hard and being wealthy is something that should be punished.
The stigma attached to wealth has become even more prominent with the presence GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney. He has come by his wealth fairly, but voters and critics consider him to be too privileged to connect with the average voter. In a not-so-sly reference to Romney, Obama slammed the “folks who were peddling … trickle-down theories — including some who are running for a certain office right now who shall not be named.” Rhetoric like this only serves to alienate the American people from each other based on wealth, creating resentment of the rich from people who are not as financially fortunate.
Here’s a thought: Cut spending drastically and free up capital so that the American people can use it as they see fit. Not only would the results more likely increase the economic security of the middle class but also our principles of freedom, fairness and hard work.

I totally agree with usc alum!   I have 2 questions for Sarah: regarding your thought   “Here’s a thought: Cut spending drastically and free up capital so that the American people can use it as they see fit. Not only would the results more likely increase the economic security of the middle class but also our principles of freedom, fairness and hard work.”
where exactly should spending be cut?   and who are “the American people” that get to decide where we can us this, free’d up capital as they see fit?
I need to correct my typo in my last line “we can USE this, free’d up capital as they see fit?”
I don’t understand the logic of this article, essentially stating that it’s not fair for the rich to pay their fair share.  There are various ways in which this can be enacted, but the point is that there is an inequity today that is apparent and should be corrected.
… A vote for Obama in 2012, not 2008.  My apologies for the typos, too.  Darn iPad keyboard….
The poor are not getting poorer – they have record obesity, cell phones, running water, autos, vacations, cable television… The USA poor are more like the middle class across the world or the aristocracy of the 17th century.
Living on the tax payers’ dime is very tempting. It is tough to break out of that dependency. Sitting at home, you spend your time the way you want, but if you start working you lose the benefits. 
Payroll taxes are shockingly high – the federal government deserves a cut of every hour of your work? Really!? Should the labor of one citizen have so little value that the federal government demand 15%, 25%, 39%? At what point is the percentage so high that you would not pay or you stop working? Is the federal government providing value to you or are they requiring payment for things that you could buy yourself for much less? Remember every federal employee gets paid to show up to work, they have annual raises, paid vacations, subsidized health care, and lifetime pensions. 
Since one trillion+ dollars are borrowed every year to pay for federal spending, the spending really costs much more (interest on the T-Bills & T-Bonds). It is like buying drinks with a credit card and rolling over the debt again and again.
The defeat ofmthe Buffet Rule is a testamony to fairness and equitability awareness.  All this proposed “rule” does is alienate and divide the people of this country.  We have not seen any sort of legislation being proposed by the Obama Admin to promote the creation of meaningful jobs in this country.  Job growth in the Federal govefnment sector is not real job growth.  It is the promotion of big government, which Obama campaigned against in 2008.
If you kids want true fairness and equitabilitymamongs thepeople, then press your Congressman for a flat tax, no more loopholes.  Cain’s 999 is an example of a plan that can work…. 
Just know that a vote for Obama in Nov 2008, is a vote to castrate the US economy, its positive global outreach and will be the beginning of an unrestrained President with nothing tomlose to effect his chmages, which we know now are destructive to America’s security.
so did the writer confuse socialism with communism? 
and how is 30% even high?
someone making 150k+ is paying around 30% tax and probably cannot get it THAT much lowered.
Ironically, those making millions are probably paying less taxes than those making 25k a year.
so yes, it should be FLAT. CLOSE ALL LOOPHOLES.
your middle class is SHRINKING, and they are also paying the highest tax in proportion to their income!
the rich is getting richer and the poor is getting poorer. the US is a failing economy right now because you are spending too much on WAR. so slash those spending, decrease the deficit and invest more on public health and education.
good post usc alum

With the first weekend of this year’s Coachella Music & Art Festival wrapped up, it’s time to reflect on the highlights and see what people are anticipating for weekend two. Of course the one thing everyone’s been talking about is the holographic resurrection of music legend Tupac Shakur during the Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre set. There were a number of guest appearances during that set, including Eminem, Warren G, Kurupt and 50 Cent to name a few but ironically, none of them could live up to the lifelike hologram of Shakur performing “Hail Mary” and rapping along with Snoop.
Despite the much buzzed hologram performance as well as rampant product placement, there was much else to be enjoyed, including impressive performances by Gotye, Florence + The Machine, Santigold, The Black Keys and not surprisingly Radiohead. Both dubstep producers Nero and band Justice sampled Prince songs while Jay-Z and Kanye West’s song “Ni**az in Paris” was sampled and remixed on several occasions over the weekend.
Of course, not everything was perfect. Greg Ginn of Black Flag played a self-absorbed set during which numerous people wandered out. And Justice showed up 25 minutes late, but managed to coax the audience on their side with their energy and amazing lightshow.
Although the second weekend of Coachella has an identical lineup as the first, it’s unclear whether all of the small touches will remain the same such as frontman Jarvis Cocker of Pulp throwing grapes and candy out to the audience. The next round of concertgoers will find out quite soon.
