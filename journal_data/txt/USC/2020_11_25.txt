The USC men’s basketball team tipped off the 2020-21 season with a 95-87 victory over California Baptist at Galen Center Wednesday night. 
The Trojans were led by No. 3 recruit freshman forward Evan Mobley, who had 21 points, nine rebounds and three blocks. His brother, sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley, had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Redshirt senior Tahj Eaddy contributed with 18 points and four assists. 
The Trojans have now won 12 of their last 13 home openers and are 48-8 in home non-conference games with Andy Enfield as head coach.
A back-and-forth battle saw seven lead changes between the two schools. 
The Trojans were down 5 with 1:59 left in the game but went on a 5-0 run to tie it. Eaddy hit a huge three with 47 seconds left in regulation to send it to overtime. 
This capped off an impressive sequence from sophomore guard Ethan Anderson, who had a huge steal leading to a bucket then dished it to Eaddy on the next possession. He highlighted the importance of making extra-effort plays for the Trojans.
“This team, I think, they look to me to really spark our defensive efforts … Those big steals, I need to come up with those because it provides energy to the team,” Anderson said in a virtual press conference after the game. “My biggest identity is that I can help the team in many different ways.”
The Trojans’ length and defensive versatility became evident in overtime. 
In the extra five minutes, CBU was held to only 8 points and went scoreless for nearly four minutes. Enfield said the adjustments USC made were the difference. 
“At the end, we soft-hedged [the picks] and let the guards go over and let the guards come to our bigs. So I thought that was effective,” Enfield said. “We took the three away a little bit [in] the later part of the game.”
Evan Mobley’s paint presence also disrupted the Lancers in overtime, along with the glue-like defense of Eaddy and Anderson on leading scorer redshirt junior guard Ty Rowell. 
A block by Evan Mobley on CBU’s third possession in overtime fueled a 10-0 run by the Trojans to put them in the driver’s seat. Anderson said that forcing the Lancers to the basket was the key to getting stops and led to confidence on the other side of the floor.
“That [block] was a very important play. At the end of the game we kept saying, ‘Let’s make them drive to the basket’ because very few times they scored when they actually put the ball on the floor,” Anderson said. “That big blocked shot definitely helped our momentum and it helped us flow into our offense easier.”
Mobley showed his defensive potential in the final minutes of the game. This proved to be a deciding factor, which Mobley said resulted from him being more locked in. 
“We were making a little bit of mistakes on the other end,” he said. “I just tried to lock in and create defensive things for our team.”
Enfield said he would like to see more of Mobley’s defensive intensity moving forward.
“Defensively, he turned it up late in the game and then in overtime,” Enfield said. “He needs to be more active, which I think he understands. Their big guy went at him a few times, and so he’s going to get better … He made a lot of great plays for his teammates tonight.”
The Trojans had a balanced attack offensively with six players scoring in double digits. Junior guard Drew Peterson provided consistent offense for the Trojans when both Mobleys were out. The transfer from Rice had 12 points, along with nine rebounds.
The Trojans struggled to take care of the ball and shoot from the free-throw line throughout most of the game. They had 17 turnovers and shot 53% from the charity stripe as a team. 
California Baptist sank 20 threes and shot 45% from the field, 49% from three. The Lancers were led by Rowell’s 32 points, including nine threes. 
Enfield said the Trojans did not have a sense of urgency against shooters on the defensive end early on. 
Last season’s USC team led the Pac-12 in rebounding, and the Trojans dominated on the glass again with 48 rebounds to California Baptist’s 28. They also scrapped for 18 offensive rebounds leading to 18 second chance points.
However, unlike last season, fans were not present at Galen Center and all coaches wore masks. Anderson said the lack of fans made it difficult for the Trojans to play energized.
“Fans don’t get enough credit … in terms of bringing the energy. So we had to create our own energy, which is something we’ve never had to experience,” Anderson said. “Playing without them certainly felt different and I think it worked to the other team’s advantage.”
The Trojans are set to face Montana Saturday at 2 p.m.

USC’s women’s basketball team opened its season in impressive fashion with an 85-55 win over LMU at Galen Center Wednesday.
The Trojans had a special night on the offensive end, as their 85 points were the most they’ve scored in a game since February 2019 — despite missing six players due to various ailments, including 2019 leading scorer and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year sophomore forward Alissa Pili.
Not a single player scored over 19 points, a sign of what appears to be a more balanced scoring attack for the Trojans this season. With a 21-11 assist-to-turnover ratio, the Trojans passed the ball often and comfortably. 
“We really really did emphasize one more pass, hit the open [player] and move the basketball,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “I was proud of the kids that they took that to heart and that they did that.” 
With Pili out, the Trojan frontcourt relied on freshman forward Amaya Oliver. In her first career game, Oliver recorded a double-double and showed her value on the offensive glass. Oliver finished with 17 points and 16 rebounds in her debut, with six rebounds coming on the offensive end. 
Trakh said Oliver can expect to be heavily involved in the frontcourt rotation with Pili and Jackson this season.
“[Oliver] gives us some good options,” Trakh said “They’re three different types of players too that will give you different looks.” 
The Trojans did struggle to move the ball on offense early in the first quarter, as open shots were hard to come by. Despite playing in an empty Galen Center, Oliver said first-game nerves were there — but didn’t last very long.
“Coming into my first game not having fans kind relieved a little pressure,” Oliver said. “It was just like playing a pick-up.” 
Along with Oliver, USC’s success on the offensive end can be attributed to its backcourt. One of five Trojans to score in double digits, junior guard Desiree Caldwell racked up seven assists to go with 13 points. Last year’s second leading scorer and sophomore guard Endyia Rogers had similar production, logging 15 points and six assists in the win. 
A USC scoring run put the game out of reach for LMU early in the fourth quarter, extending the lead from 12 to 20 in just over two minutes. The Trojans made 11 threes on the afternoon compared to just four for the Lions. 
Continuing with the theme of an unpredictable offense, the Trojans’ leading scorer in their season-opening win was redshirt freshman guard Madison Campbell. Campbell exceeded expectations in her long-awaited debut finishing with 19 points, 15 of those coming from behind the 3-point line. 
Trakh was highly complimentary of Campbell’s resilience leading up to her return. She was supposed to be out a full year after having “serious back surgery” in December 2019.
“We’re very proud of her determination and her effort and her will and her desire to come back on the court,” Trakh said. “That’s a ‘Fight On’ spirit if there ever is one.”  
While the 30-point season-opening win can temporarily appease some concerns, Trakh said the Trojans still have work to do on the defensive end. 
“With six people I think the team decided they were going to rest on defense and save their energy for offense,” Trakh said jokingly. “We’ve got to get back to work on our defensive fundamentals and our player-to-player defense and our zone.” 
The Trojans are set to open their Pac-12 schedule with a visit to Arizona State Dec. 4.
