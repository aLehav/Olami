As the new No. 1 team in the country, USC women’s tennis will have a target on its back during the Women of Troy’s road trip up to the Pacific Northwest.
USC last occupied the top ranking in the nation more than a decade ago in 2003, and they will look to stay there with victories over No. 56 Oregon and No. 44 Washington.
Since a heartbreaking defeat in Westwood to archrivals UCLA in early March, the Women of Troy have responded with a four-game win streak, including a 6-1 drubbing of then-No. 10 Stanford. USC’s overall record stands at 14-2, and the team sports a perfect 3-0 record in Pac-12 play so far this season.
Oregon, on the other hand, started the season well but is beginning to lose momentum. The Ducks followed up four straight wins in February with a 2-3 record since. They now have an 8-5 record on the season and are trying to break out of a     two-game losing streak with an upset over USC.
In the same fixture last year, the Women of Troy shut out the Ducks, 4-0, at Marks Stadium. Traveling up to Eugene this season may pose a different type of challenge for the squad, but it doesn’t faze head coach Richard Gallien.
“We’re just trying to get better, whether it’s in Eugene, Seattle or [Arizona State],” Gallien said. “We have seven matches left for the rest of the year, so we’re going to try to win the match, but we’re just trying to get better.”
To react to a tough loss the way USC did after falling to Bruins was no easy task, but the Women of Troy were up to the challenge. They haven’t lost since and now look down on their fourth-ranked bitter rivals from the No. 1 spot. The key to such a strong response, according to Gallien, was the maturity and character within the team.
“[It sounds] totally trite and cliche,” Gallien said, “but it’s really true because if you don’t have those [qualities], then you are just not really resilient.”
USC boasts many players high up in the ITA rankings in both singles and doubles.
Junior Giuliana Olmos has enjoyed a very productive season and currently leads her teammates with a career-best No. 11 ranking. Seniors Sabrina Santamaria and Zoë Scandalis are ranked No. 20 and                      No. 49, respectively, and talented freshmen round out the ranked Women of Troy, with Meredith Xepoleas at No. 64, Gabby Smith at No. 65 and Madison Westby at No. 73.
Olmos and Scandalis are also the No. 15 pair in the country, and sophomore Zoë Katz and Santamaria recently broke into the rankings at No. 19. Katz has previously also partnered with senior Gabriella DeSimone, and they still hold the No. 30 ranking.
The career highs and top rankings may excite fans, but the Women of Troy themselves are not paying attention. At the end of the day, they’re just numbers.
“It’s just some computer ranking,” Gallien said. “We could win four-in-a-row and drop.”
But beyond ignoring numbers, Gallien believes that taking the “treading water” approach atop the rankings is not the best course of action.
“I think if you try to hold on to something, then it’s a mistake,” he said. “Then the aggressor from behind has the advantage.”
USC’s clash against Oregon will begin at 1:30 p.m. today at the Student Tennis Center in Eugene.
The Women of Troy will then travel to Seattle and face off against Washington at the Bill Quillian Stadium on Saturday. These two matches kick off a four-game road trip for USC, as the players travel to Tucson next Friday for their matchup against Arizona before taking on Arizona State in Tempe the next day.
The Women of Troy will not return home until they square off against Utah at Marks Stadium on April 10.

Academic Cultural Assembly held a panel discussion event through their EdMonth series on Thursday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The event titled, “The Girl Effect: Moving from Why to How,” discussed the unique potential of adolescent girls and how to break the cycles of intergenerational poverty.
Panelists included Martha Adams, chief creative officer of Girl Rising, and Melissa Moritz, vice president of STEM and Education Initiatives at Teach For America.
EdMonth is a monthlong program dedicated to raising awareness about the state of education in the United States. The talk focused on how to achieve “the girl effect,” the idea that girls can play an important role in solving persistent and global development problems like poverty.
The event was sponsored by the Office of Religious Life, Graduate Student Government, Undergraduate Student Government, Program Board, the Academic Culture Assembly and the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab.
After seeing the lineup for this year’s EdMonth, Greg Woodburn, a graduate student in business administration at the Marshall School of Business, decided to organize guests to join the panel discussion and reached out to Hannah Nguyen, director of EdMonth 2015.
The event began with a screening of the Nepal chapter of Girl Rising, which tells the story of a girl named Suma. While her brothers went to school, Suma was forced into bonded labor at age six, but she was eventually able to break free and carve the way for others like her in Nepal.
Abby Fifer Mandell, executive director of the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab, moderated the event.
BSEL provides students and faculty with opportunities to apply business principles to address world problems such as poverty. Through events, programs and classes, BSEL encourages social entrepreneurship. Mandell oversees all of the staff, programs, classes and events. She also teaches BAEP 499: Social Innovation Design Lab.
Mandell kicked off the panel discussion by asking Adams and Moritz how they obtained their current positions.
Adams brings her prior experience at the Discovery Channel, BBC and National Geographic, where she produced award-winning films and documentaries, to her position at Girl Rising. She was originally recruited to produce Girl Rising, but now juggles the television, filmmaking and social media components.
Through film and various other mediums, Girl Rising is a global campaign that emphasizes education, especially for girls, who the campaign’s creators believe are vital to social change. The Girl Rising film has nine chapters that show different programs around the world how they work to help adolescent girls.
Moritz works on domestic issues within Teach For America, a national organization that places recent college graduates in underprivileged classrooms to teach for two years and effect change in educational inequity.
After graduating from MIT with a degree in biology in 2006, Moritz joined TFA and worked as a middle school science teacher at MS 321 in New York City for two years. Since then, she has worked at TFA for seven years. She started off as TFA’s recruitment director for the Boston area but now leads TFA’s STEM initiatives. Moritz works with all 50 of TFA’s regional sites, as well as the national team, to help recruit STEM educators.
“STEM has the incredible potential to end cycles of poverty because there are incredible job opportunities available in STEM,” Moritz said. “Even more so, when you learn a science, technology, engineering or math subject, it teaches you how to look at challenges around you and provides a framework for how to solve those problems.”
Moritz first decided to pursue science after she was encouraged to do so by her seventh grade science teacher. As a result, she constantly emphasizes the importance of mentorship and role models.
“I think it’s a lot about empowerment and finding your voice,” Moritz said. “If you are someone like myself who has had an amazing education, you have a responsibility to the next generation to make sure that other women are able to follow in your footsteps.”
Mandell asked Adams and Moritz several more questions such as what a good day at work looks like and which countries are doing exemplary jobs in the field of education before turning to the audience for questions.
“When you talk about girls’ education, you don’t want to say it’s an either-or situation,” said Nicole Medina, a freshman majoring in communication. “I thought it was great how [Moritz] said it was a both-and situation.”
Following the Q&A session, attendees were given the opportunity to speak one-on-one with Adams and Moritz.
“It’s really great to see how women can empower other women, and as a male, it’s really interesting to see how we can do our part,” said Mark Lee, a junior double majoring in business administration  and psychology.

The Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Public Enterprise hosted a panel discussion on the government and nonprofit sector efforts in revitalizing the Los Angeles River on Thursday night.
The panelists in attendance discussed the various projects involved in the L.A. river revitalization as well as the methods of working with different organizations and the issues that arise throughout the process.
The discussion was moderated by Raphael Bostic, director of the Bedrosian Center and former professor at the School of Policy, Planning and Development.
Prior to coming to USC, Bostic served for three years in the Obama Administration as the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Carol Armstrong, director of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s LARiverWorks team, explained that the L.A. river revitalization movement began with the residents of Los Angeles.
“The river revitalization plan really started with the community as a natural heritage resource, and then it took formal form through an ad hoc committee in the city council,” Armstrong said.
Armstrong also spoke about the bureaucratic structure of the master plan.
“In terms of governance, we needed a three-tier governance structure that engaged groups outside of the government,” Armstrong said.
Omar Brownson, first executive director of the LA River Revitalization Corporation, discussed the project plan and the need for non-profit organizations to get involved in the government effort.
“I think we’ve had the fortune of having a master plan, and we were looking for progress — not perfection. The L.A. river is something of a baton that’s carried forward,” said Brownson. “As a non-profit organization, we were created because the government alone can’t do it. We’re always looking to see if we could bring the right people and the right players together.”
Brownson also explained why the revitalization project from the perspective of increasing public transit should occur right now.
“Now, we can think a little bigger. We tax ourselves $40 billion to invest in public transportation, and we’re at a time when we can make a bigger case. We have an opportunity to make the case as to why we can invest more in infrastructure,” Brownson said.
Mia Lehrer, an internationally recognized landscape designer and founding principal of Mia Lehrer + Associates, discussed the perception of the project and how it is progressing in the public eye.
“People come to L.A. and they want to see all the projects along the river. Let’s face it — there are no big projects yet,” Lehrer said. “In my world, my cohorts all want to have the covers of magazines, and this isn’t it. This is a legacy project, and we’re all in Southern California being really engaged in this effort.”
Ziyu Ouyang, a junior majoring in geodesign, explained what drew her to attend the panel discussion.
“I’ve heard a lot about this project in my classes, and this discussion has been going on for a really long time now,” Ouyang said. “When I saw this event, I thought it would be beneficial to hear from different experts and the people who are actually working on this project.”

The drop deadline for classes has officially been extended in response to a resolution presented last semester by the Undergraduate Student Government. Beginning next fall, the drop deadline will occur during the seventh week of school, instead of during the third week.
The new resolution was approved and presented to the Committee of Academic Policies and Procedures in December 2014, which then passed the resolution that same day. The new deadlines have been officially posted on the university calendar and the Registrar’s website.
Nicole Schrad, USG’s director of academic affairs, initiated the idea when she noticed that students had to decide to drop a class before they had any important tests or projects. Thus, students had no measure of how well they could do in their classes.
Chief of Staff Hassan Ebrahim noticed that other institutions had their drop deadlines well into the semester, giving their students a greater advantage by allowing them to drop classes at later dates.
“This is something we felt would facilitate a more academically sound environment and encourage students to pursue more challenging classes … and the administration definitely agreed,” Ebrahim said.
Schrad, along with Greek Senator Providence Illisevich and Assistant Director of Academic Affairs Maariyah Patel, wrote and presented the first resolution to the Registrar last September. The resolution proposed to extend the add/drop and pass/no pass letter grade deadlines to the seventh week of the semester, on the grounds that it would encourage students to try out new classes and be able to drop them without consequences if they were not good fits.
“Students need to feel that they can earn a transcript that not necessarily makes it easier for them, but that reflects what they are capable of at the same level than all the other students at top private universities,” Illisevich said.
Schrad explained that the Registrar’s main concern with the first resolution was that they did not want students changing their classes from a letter grade to pass/no pass after the third week of school.
“The Registrar thought that’d be better because a lot of classes work in groups, and they didn’t want groups to be hindered by people changing to pass/no pass and then slacking off,” Schrad said.
Additionally, the financial aid office feared that changing the deadline would affect tuition and the payment process.
“They were concerned that there’s a lot of different laws involved with financial aid, and so they wanted to make sure that students were flagged if they were dropping too many courses,” Schrad said.
USG amended the resolution and presented a new one this semester, which included the stipulation that classes could only be changed from pass/no pass to letter grades after week three, and not vice versa.
This new resolution also stated that courses could not be added after the third week of classes, and that any classes dropped after this deadline still had to be paid for.
“We actively answered to [the administration’s] requests because their support was huge in the long run,” Schrad said.
Douglas Shook, dean of academic records and registrar, explained that the amendment would not disrupt the way in which the university operates.
“If you withdraw from a class after week three, it’s still going to be part of our internal and financial records,” Shook said. “It’s just that we won’t show a ‘W’ on your transcripts, and that made it easier for us to accommodate [USG’s] request because we weren’t changing how the university records enrollments or registrations, and it doesn’t have implications for financial aid.”
Many students explained that they were in favor of the amended resolution for a new add/drop deadline.
“If you fail the first midterm, then you can drop the class without being penalized. I’m not advocating anyone failing, but this is a safety net for people that are going to grad school,” said Jad Elgaali, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience.

The No. 3-ranked Women of Troy will hit the road this weekend to take on No. 17 LMU in a conference match on Saturday before heading up north to play CSU Bakersfield in an MPSF clash on Sunday.
Neither the Lions (15-9) nor the Roadrunners (12-11, 0-2 MPSF) have ever defeated a USC team.
The program is 25-0 all-time against Loyola Marymount, while it’s 11-0 all-time against CSU Bakersfield.
This will be the Women of Troy’s first meeting with LMU this season after defeating them 14-5 last April.
The Lions will be coming off a pair of Golden Coast Conference matches against Azusa Pacific and Fresno Pacific.
LMU defetaed Azusa Pacific 16-7 on Thursday.
On the other hand, USC went on an offensive explosion earlier this season in January against CSU Baskersfield on their way to a 33-5 route.
This weekend’s slate of games will be USC’s first competition since the team’s spring break trip to Hawaii,  where they came home with two commanding wins.
While away from the mainland, the Women of Troy  (17-2, 1-1 MPSF) dominated Pomona-Pitzer by a score of 22-3. Senior Monica Vavic continued her scoring tear since becoming the program’s all-time leading scorer by netting a team-high five goals in the match, upping her career total to 264.
The team would use the momentum from that game to power past No. 7 Hawai’i by a score of 10-1.
The stifling USC defense against the Rainbow Wahine was led by freshman goalie Victoria Chamorro, who posted eight saves in the win.
In fact, the Women of Troy held their host scoreless for the last 11 minutes of play.
The Women of Troy currently lead the MPSF on both sides of the ball, offense and defensive respectively.
The conference’s number one offense is currently averaging just under 18 goals per game, while the team is giving up about four goals per game.
This dominance on both offense and defense is apparent from the fact that USC has outscored its opponents this season by more than four times, 338-80.
Having the best program’s top scorer in Vavic, who has tallied 73 goals to date this season, definitely helps, but she has had a lot of help along the way,
Sophomore Stephania Haralabidis follows Vavic on the team’s scoring sheet with 47 goals thus far. Her twin sister, Ioanna is next in line with 35 goals.
The Women of Troy will likely have to put their defensive caps on to stop a trio of established scoring threats they will be facing this weekend.
LMU’s top returning scorer in  junior Ivana Castro has posted an impressive 55 goals for the Lions this season.
For CSU Bakersfield, the duo of sophomores Kristen Jensen and Nicola Barrett lead the team with 40 goals each.
Both Saturday’s clash against LMU and Sunday’s matchup with the Roadrunners of Cal State Bakersfield are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.
The sport is not mentioned in the headline or in the article. The Women of Troy is used for all their sport programs.
Finally noticed the words Water Polo in light small print under the writer’s name at top.

It seems that every year another “NFL to Los Angeles” headline pops up. The Los Angeles Rams and Raiders fans appear in mass numbers, the NFL dismisses the notion, and a few weeks later it’s as if the rumor never happened.
This NFL offseason has produced not one, not two, but three possible teams heading to L.A. as soon as the 2016 season. Rams owner Stan Kroenke has publicly said he will be moving his team to Inglewood to play in an 80,000 seat stadium built on the former site of the Hollywood Park racetrack.
The Raiders and Chargers have proposed a joint stadium located in Carson that would host both teams and contain a large number of restaurants and other venues surrounding the stadium, similar to L.A. Live next to the Staples Center.
All this happened while a proposal for a stadium located next to the Staples Center with funding, a naming sponsorship and city backing sat waiting for a team to commit.
That plan now joins the approximately one million, just  maybe a slight exaggeration, other stadium/team proposals that L.A. has seen since the Rams and Raiders bolted in 1994.
Now, these stadium proposals sound nice and all, but I’m not buying into it yet. Not until shovel hits dirt will I believe that America’s biggest sport will return to the City of Angels.
In my 21 years of life, I’ve been let down too many times from these fake rumors.
Let’s just go over a brief history of the past 20 years since the NFL left before I explain why you shouldn’t get too excited over these new stadium proposals.
In just over 20 years, Los Angeles has been linked to almost half of the teams in the NFL. In 1997, the Seahawks were supposed to move before getting a new stadium.
In 1999, the expansion team was supposed to be in L.A. before Houston swooped in and convinced the NFL otherwise. In 2002, the Colts were supposed to move from Indianapolis before getting a new stadium.
In the late 2000s, the 49ers, Vikings and Bills were all linked to Los Angeles before getting new stadiums from their respective cities.
The reason I’m pointing this history out is because owners have used Los Angeles as a bargaining tool against cities that threaten to provide no funding for a new stadium. Owners have been taking advantage of L.A.’s vacancy as a way to leverage themselves.
Imagine you have two friends: one who will buy you lunch, and another who won’t. You’d be much more likely to go to lunch with the friend who will buy you a nice sandwich than with the one who is going to leave you with the bill.
Or, simply put, why would a small market team with an ancient stadium stay in a place like Minneapolis or Buffalo when sunny, beautiful California is awaiting?
This is the main reason I am not willing to buy into these rumors that L.A. will have three teams playing here in fewer than two years.
All these teams — the Rams, Raiders and Chargers -— play in some of the oldest stadiums in the NFL and have long been trying to get public financing for new stadiums.
Adding to the controversy is the fact that the NFL has not backed either plan. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke Wednesday at the annual NFL meeting, and his words were not comforting to L.A. fans.
“First, let me just say we’re focused on doing this right,” Goodell said. “If we go back to the Los Angeles market, we want to succeed for the long term, and we have a lot to do to get to that place. So we’re not focused on ‘16.”
The fact that the NFL is not in the nation’s second largest market is inconceivable. L.A. teams such as the Lakers and Trojans are international brands that stretch all across the globe. With the NFL’s recent obsession with becoming a global game, one would figure L.A. would be the first step.
The fact that the NFL has yet to back any of these plans has me feeling iffy on the whole subject.
Furthermore, any team that does relocate to L.A. would have to play in a temporary stadium, such as the Rose Bowl or the Coliseum.
The Rose Bowl is the most viable and realistic option, but if two teams were to move here like many expect, that would mean the stadium would host three teams.
The venue is already limited to a certain number of days it can host events, meaning one team would have to play in the not-fully-suitable Coliseum.
The NFL might very well return to Los Angeles in the near future, and it absolutely should.
For now, however, I’m not buying into any rumors until I see a stadium being built, whether it be in Inglewood, Carson or some other city in Los Angeles.

After splitting two matches last week, the Trojans return to action today for the first time since spring break against conference rival UCSB. The rematch between the No. 9 Trojans (12-7, 10-6 MPSF) and the No. 7 Gauchos (13-7, 9-7 MPSF) comes a little over a month since UCSB beat the Trojans in Santa Barbara.
In the Trojans’ return to conference play last week after two nonconference games the week before, the Trojans fell in four sets (25-21, 22-25, 25-23, 27-25) to No. 14 Cal State Northridge (8-13, 5-10 MPSF) on Wednesday, March 18. Two days later, the Trojans were able to get back to their winning ways and pull off a five-set (21-25, 25-19, 14-25, 25-19, 15-10) win over No. 10 Long Beach State (12-10, 8-9 MPSF).
Against Cal State Northridge, the Trojans struggled hitting, recording only a .223 hitting percentage on the night to Cal State Northridge’s .236. But it was a breakout match for freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta. Tuileta, a Hawaii native who also plays for the football team as a backup quarterback, made only his third start of the season and hit .469 over the match. He led the team with 17 kills, 10 digs and three service aces, all three of which were career highs.
The Trojans hit only marginally better overall against Long Beach State at a percentage of .238, but they were able to come out with a victory nonetheless by holding Long Beach State to only .197. The Trojans recorded 57 digs on the night. Junior libero Brooks Varni led the way with 14, senior setter Micah Christenson added 12 and Tuileta contributed 11.
Both matches were on the road. Earlier in the season, when the Trojans hosted Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State, they beat both in straight sets.
“I was really proud of the way the guys hung in there,” head coach Bill Ferguson said about Long Beach State in his weekly recap with the athletic department. “We’re getting off to slow starts and we haven’t solved that problem yet. I think if we had gotten our act together early in the first set, we could have gotten out of there in three or four. That wasn’t the case, but the guys stayed with it and fought and battled.”
The Trojans will look to avenge a loss earlier this season at UC Santa Barbara with the chance to now play the Gauchos at home. Weston Nielson and Kevin Donahue previously led the Gauchos to the three-set win (25-19, 25-17, 25-22) with 12 kills apiece.
The Trojans had arguably their poorest hitting performance all season that night, hitting for only .070.
On Saturday, the Trojans take on crosstown rival No. 12 UCLA (10-8, 6-8 MPSF). When these two met about a month back at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins took the match 3-1 (25-15, 25-23, 22-25, 25-22).
The last time the rivals met on the court, USC was without Christenson — an All-American and USA National Team member — and junior opposite hitter Josh Kirchner; Christenson had an acute sinus infection and Kirchner had a sprained ankle.
Notably, neither team hit particularly well — USC hit .118 and UCLA hit .200.
To best the Bruins, the Trojans will focus on shutting down freshman outside hitter Jake Arnitz and freshman opposite hitter Christian Hessenauer. Last match, Arnitz had 16 kills and Hessenauer had 12 kills.
USC will also look to contine the progression it has made over the last two weeks. Ferguson has noticed that the team has improved both its blocking and digging, two aspects that were in a bit of a lull following the Trojans’ dominant start to the season.
The Trojans have also mixed up their serving a bit. For a couple of matches, their serves were not as effective as they once were, but now Ferguson sees great potential in the newly adjusted serving tactics.
“We can custom-make our serving depending on who our opponent is and how we need to play the match,” Ferguson said.
If the Trojans can capitalize on the way that they’ve been playing recently, they should be able to pick up two home wins, which will keep them in contention for a competitive seed heading into the MPSF tournament at the end of the season.
The Trojans play UCSB tonight at 8 p.m. and UCLA on Saturday at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

When dueling perceptions of sexism and censorship are spilled on the canvas of creative expression, the result is not a pretty picture.
Last week, DC Comics elected to cancel the variant cover of the latest issue of Batgirl after an online preview was met with disgust and outrage from a small, but vocal, contingent of Twitter and Tumblr users who accused artist Rafael Albuquerque of glorifying violence against women and reinforcing the same hackneyed damsel stereotype the plucky heroine, known by day as Barbara Gordon, was invented to combat. The outcry even earned its own hashtag, “#ChangeTheCover,” which quickly drew the ire of other fans who viewed DC’s decision as tantamount to self-censorship, which it most certainly was.
The cover art, which depicts a leering, pistol-packing Joker smearing a bloody smile across the face of a weeping, petrified Batgirl, was actually part of an ongoing series celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Clown Prince of Crime, who first menaced the good people of Gotham back in 1940, and was intended as a homage to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s seminal one-shot graphic novel The Killing Joke from 1988, now widely considered one of the greatest Batman stories ever told despite being subject to multiple feminist critiques in the years since its publication.
The comic, a supremely unsettling meditation on the razor-thin demarcation between order and chaos, gave the Joker both his multiple-choice origin story, something Heath Ledger would later employ to marvelous effect in The Dark Knight, and, for the first time ever, a clear psychological motivation aside from his eternal dance of death with his symbiotic arch-nemesis Batman: the notion that “one bad day” is the only thing separating the rest of humanity from the Joker’s subterranean levels of depravity. Eager to test his new pet theory, the Joker kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and attempts to drive him mad by shooting and crippling Barbara, the lawman’s only daughter, thus ending her career as Batgirl. Although it’s never explicitly stated in the narrative, many fans and critics believe the assault was also sexual in nature, adding an extra layer of unpleasantness to Albuquerque’s artwork.
So, was DC right to pull the cover? Not in my opinion, but the placement certainly seems odd given the optimistic, empowered tone of the current Batgirl series. After two decades of serving as the wheelchair-bound computer hacker Oracle, Batgirl finally recovered the use of her legs during the launch of DC’s New 52 continuity. The move was greeted with skepticism initially — the Oracle persona had grown incredibly popular, especially within the disabled community — and her solo title struggled at first, but the creative team of Cameron Stewart, Brenden Fletcher and Babs Tarr managed to right the ship, retooling the character for a younger, primarily female audience without sacrificing the qualities — the fierce intelligence, the indomitable will, the playful banter — that made her so interesting to begin with.
If DC’s decision to cancel the variant was motivated by a desire to simply move on from the controversy, that strategy appears to have backfired drastically. The great cover debate is still raging across traditional and social media, making the initial uproar look rather quaint by comparison.
The battle lines of this argument have been clearly drawn from the start. One side views the image as further evidence of the rampant misogyny that continues to plague the world of mainstream comics, a traditionally male-dominated subculture whose ham-fisted efforts to court a wider audience – Hey look, the new Thor is a woman! Ms. Marvel is a 16-year-old Muslim from New Jersey! The Green Lantern from Earth-Two married his boyfriend! – only serve to highlight the troubling lack of diversity among its own creative workforce. The other side, wary of a return to the puritanical heyday of the Comics Code Authority, sees this purely as an issue of free speech, one where creativity is being curtailed by arbitrary litmus tests and the tyranny of what constitutes good taste.
Both sides have their points. There’s no denying that sexism is alive and well in today’s comic books. Just last year, Italian artist Milo Manara was taken to task for producing a variant cover for Marvel’s Spider-Woman #1 that seemed absurdly fixated on the character’s shapely red posterior. DC’s Catwoman is continually forced into anatomically challenged action poses, including illustrator Guillem March’s notorious zero-issue cover from 2012 where the whip-cracking jewel thief was reduced to a leather-clad blob of breasts and buttocks, frozen in a position that would be extremely painful for anyone with a spine.
Unlike these examples, however, the Batgirl cover was never intended to be titillating. Albuquerque isn’t cheapening a traumatic event by indulging in creepy fan service. The image is inherently disturbing, a nightmare brought to waking life, and it’s meant to provoke a strong emotional response. On that count, it’s an unqualified success. Would it have been better to show Batgirl as an avenging survivor instead of a helpless victim? Perhaps, but that’s not what the artist chose to convey.
Much has been made about the fact that Albuquerque himself was the one who asked DC to cancel the variant, issuing a statement that read in part, “My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art.” If this change of heart was genuine, more power to him, but his carefully worded apology stands in sharp contrast to the proudly confrontational nature of his artwork, both in the Bat-verse and in the pages of Scott Snyder’s creator-owned American Vampire. Did the online protests force his hand? If so, it’s a sad commentary on the state of an increasingly risk-averse industry.
I’ll end this by addressing anyone who was upset by the Batgirl cover art: You have the right to be offended, just as all artists reserve the right to offend. Your beliefs and opinions are perfectly valid, but it’s a mistake to impose limits on creative expression. If you think a piece of art is racist or misogynistic or homophobic or blasphemous, feel free to verbally vivisect it to your heart’s delight. I’ll be cheering you on, regardless of whether I agree with you or not. We’re all content creators now, and if your analysis is clever and cogent enough, your voice will be heard and your subject will be exposed for what it is. But please don’t call for art to be banned. Don’t create a culture where artists have to produce apologies instead of new art. There’s a fine line between the critic and the censor, and to cross that line is to surrender to madness.

There is nothing quite like seeing a classic movie in the theater. Watching a film on the large screen, in the dark, while sharing the experience with hundreds of other people creates an immersive experience that can’t be recreated on a regular television. Theaters like the American Cinematheque and New Beverly do their best to screen as many classic films as they can, but for most classic films, one usually has no choice but to watch them on a screen much smaller than they were intended for. Turner Classic Movies knows that these classics need the opportunity to shine on the big screen once again, so this weekend they are putting on the sixth annual TCM Classic Film Festival dedicated exclusively to showcasing some of the best films ever made in a handful of the most storied cinema houses scattered around Hollywood.
The Chinese Theatre, Egyptian Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, Montalban Theatre and the Roosevelt Hotel are all within walking distance of each other on Hollywood Boulevard (or just off of it in the case of the Montalban), and they will serve as the home to 80 classic films over the course of the four-day festival. The selections this year were very loosely based around the theme of “History According to Hollywood,” but the thread of the theme is not very strongly felt through the lineup, which instead is overshadowed by the sheer amount of classics on display.
The festival kicked off on Thursday afternoon with a celebration of the Sound of Music featuring special guest appearances by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, the actors who played Maria and Captain Von Trapp in the 1965 musical. Aside from that tasty appetizer, the main course of the festival is certainly concentrated in the stellar Friday and Saturday lineups.
The Friday lineup is so stacked that upon first glance, a festival-goer will surely be torn as to which films to attend, as so many classics are being played, and often at overlapping times in different theaters. For example, the El Capitan Theatre will be playing David Lean’s 1962 desert masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia at 10 a.m. before the 1940 Disney classic and Avengers trailer fodder Pinocchio at 3 p.m., which will be followed by the often imitated, but never duplicated, Raiders of the Lost Ark at 5:45 p.m. and William Wyler’s irresistibly charming Audrey Hepburn-Gregory Peck vehicle Roman Holiday at 9:15 p.m. That right there is an amazing day of films in a classic theater.
Unfortunately for the indecisive, there are four other venues offering conflicting classics throughout the day. If the choice is to see Peter O’Toole ride out into God’s Anvil on his camel to save a member of his caravan, then kudos — there are few movies which are more enhanced when seen on the big screen — but the festival-goer who attends that screening will have the nagging thought throughout about the screening of Bob Fosse’s sneaky-great Lenny Bruce biopic Lenny over at the Egyptian, especially with Dustin Hoffman himself scheduled to make an appearance.
The Pinocchio time slot is downright stacked, with concurrent screenings of An Affair to Remember, The Cincinnati Kid (featuring an appearance by Ann-Margaret), Young Mr. Lincoln (featuring an appearance by Peter Fonda) and Limelight all overlapping with the run time. You can’t go wrong, but you’re fated to miss four great classic movie experiences no matter which film you choose.
Perhaps the biggest conflict on Friday is Raiders of the Lost Ark being played against the world premiere of the new restoration of French classic heist film Rififi across the street at the Chinese. Raiders is one of the best pieces of cinema ever produced. It combines artful direction with a plot that never slows down. Seeing it on the big screen is always a treat. On the other hand, Rififi is quite possibly the best answer to the question, “If I like Raiders what else should I watch?” among the films on the festival docket. Jules Dassin’s 1955 film is so completely cool every time you watch it. Any heist film worth its salt owes a debt to this film, and especially to the legendary 28-minute heist scene that generates an incredible amount of suspense and excitement without a word of dialogue or a single note of music. It is downright criminal to make a festival-goer choose between the two. This is not to mention the showing of the Buster Keaton classic Steamboat Bill, Jr., which sneaks in at 7:15 p.m.
To close out the day, Roman Holiday is scheduled against an Apollo 13 screening, featuring an appearance by none other than real-life Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell himself; Alfred Hitchcock’s gothic classic Rebecca; and one of the best James Bond films of all time, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, featuring the one-hit-Bond himself George Lazenby.
Saturday is less jam-packed, but it still features some killer movies. Another, albeit slightly colder, David Lean masterpiece, Doctor Zhivago, starts the day off at 9:15 a.m. Malcolm X, featuring an appearance by Spike Lee, is scheduled against Rebel Without a Cause at 1:30 p.m. The 6 p.m. slot is more crowded, with The Apartment (and a Shirley MacLaine appearance) being put up against Mel Brooks’ History of the World, Part 1 and Elia Kazan’s Viva Zapata!, but the 9:15 p.m. showing of The French Connection featuring William Friedkin himself towers over everything else at that time slot.
For dessert on Sunday, TCM saved room for Patton, The Philadelphia Story, Marriage Italian Style and Psycho. A fitting quartet of bona fide classics to close out the show with less drama, as the four films do not overlap their time slots.
The lineup TCM put together this year is quite impressive. And while passes are likely no longer available, a USC student can purchase tickets to individual shows for $10 with a student ID. A couple of days in cinematic heaven is within reach right around the corner in the heart of Hollywood.

Ted Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, is the first Republican to officially announce his candidacy for president in 2016. His early endorsements include every registered Democrat in the United States. His early detractors should include every Republican who hopes their party can make a credible case for the White House.
And yet, the media (especially the lefties like CNN and MSNBC) seem to care more about two of the least important things about Cruz: where he was born, and where his healthcare comes from. Both should be debunked in favor of much larger concerns.
Ted Cruz is a U.S. citizen but was born in Canada, which some say poses a challenge in the face of the Constitution’s requirement that only a “natural born citizen” can run for president. Cruz renounced Canadian citizenship in May 2014 and has technically been a U.S. citizen since birth because of his American mother. Because of this, in the Harvard Law Review, Paul Clement, the solicitor general during George W. Bush’s second term as president, and Neal Katyal, who was an acting solicitor general for President Barack Obama, both argued there is “no question” that Cruz fulfills the natural born citizen requirement. Talking about Cruz’s natural born citizenship like it’s legitimately in question rips the rug out from under anyone who still wants to make fun of Donald Trump and the birthers for thinking Obama was born in Kenya.
The next straw man the media latched on to was Cruz’s announcement on CNN that he would sign up for health care through Obamacare’s exchange based in Washington, D.C. The press wasted no time lampooning him for signing up for the very service that he pledged “to repeal every word of,” but in reality, Cruz is only signing up for health insurance because he is no longer covered by his wife’s plan (she is taking a leave of absence from her job at Goldman Sachs in light of his run for the presidency). Cruz needs insurance, and he and his wife could either purchase a wildly expensive private plan, or they, like many Americans, could get it through Cruz’s status as a U.S. senator. In the former case, members of Congress must sign up through the law’s D.C. exchange. Cruz isn’t doing anything hypocritical — he’s just following the law.
Instead of chortling away with headlines like “Ted-I-Am Really Likes Obamacare,” CNN should devote its time to explaining the ramifications of Cruz’s call to repeal Obamacare. Doing so would kick millions of kids off their parents’ insurance, allow insurance companies to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and permit insurers to stop paying for treatment of expensive illnesses like cancer once patients reach their coverage limit. Sounds a little more serious than being born in Canada, don’t you think?
Republicans, from the top donors, to the party leadership, to the voters, should avoid Cruz at all costs for two reasons. First, he will drag the entire party to the right in primary season and damage beyond repair whatever candidate ends up in the general election. He is radically socially conservative, and it doesn’t take much imagining to see him standing up at the first Republican primary debate, announcing his support for a Constitutional amendment to allow the states to make gay marriage illegal if they so choose and demanding the likes of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio to raise their hands if they support it. If they don’t, they’ll lose the primary -— if they do, they’ll have no chance at winning the presidency.
Cruz is also a fierce denier of the belief that human-caused global warming represents a threat to the planet. He has compared believers of human-caused climate warming (which includes 97 percent of the scientific community) to “flat-earthers” and argued that the cold weather when he visited New Hampshire casts doubt on their beliefs. Again, a belief perhaps more dangerous than where Cruz gets his healthcare from.
When Cruz’s views aren’t threatening the planet’s survival, they are likely diminishing his chances to beat prospective Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. This should, of course, seem obvious, but when the media on the left treats Cruz like a clown rather than someone who takes himself seriously and is revered by a substantial number of evangelical conservatives, they do themselves an enormous disservice.
Here’s why: Cruz’s chances of winning the presidency are about as likely as Vin Diesel’s Furious 7 winning the Oscar for Best Picture. Averaging the three national primary polls taken in March puts Cruz in eighth place with 4.6 percent of the vote. But, similar to Missouri senatorial candidate Todd Akin, who discussed his views of “legitimate rape” and had no chance of winning but single-handedly managed to tank the rest of the party’s chances in the 2012 midterms, Cruz could also sabotage the entire Republican field via guilt by association. Moreover, if his funding doesn’t run out, he can keep showing up in debates and on primary ballots. Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight described the Cruz campaign as a “juicy rib-eye that robbers use to distract a guard dog during a heist.” Cruz’s candidacy has handed the media a gift on a silver platter, but they’re totally missing their chance to devour it.

I hope Cruz stays in the race as long as any deep-pocketed jackasses are willing to waste their greenbacks on him.  He’s a gift from the gods to SNL, and every stand up comedian itching to make a name for himself at the Laugh Factory.
Whether it be conservative or liberal, people need to slash past the Paper Tigers and get to the true meats of the issues, rather than trumpeting about snow in the Northwest in Spring, or inane birthed issues.  We NEED healthcare.  The Obama care system is flawed and ripe for criticism, but nothing more.  It is far better than what existed before, the GOP does nothing more than insist on throwing out the baby with the bathwater and putting us in a much worse situation than we had before Obama are was passed.  The GOP does not offer anything to replace Obamacare, the present plan for immigration reform, taxation or any other genuine issue: all they ever do is block, filibuster,  complain,  criticize and whine, without actually offering a trace of a solution to any of the issues!
Has Boehner EVER offered a point-by-point  alternative to healthcare?  To immigration and border control?  To taxation reform, other than continually widening the door through which trillions of dollars flow to the ultra-rich, while the middle and lower class income and standard of living continue to slide?
When Dubbya left office, he left us with an economy in the toilet, the stock market stagnant, unemployment at its worst.  All they have ever talked about is, what a terrible prez Obama is, and blocked anything he ever tried to do, despite the fact that unemployment is not lower than it’s been in nearly a decade, more people have health care now than ever before, there is a genuine effort to lock down our borders, and all Boehner and the rest can do is complain about imaginary issues.
Sickening.
No, Hillary Clinton’s not perfect.  She irritates me on occasion with her control-freak style.  But she’s a thousand times better than any of the alternatives such as Cruz, Bush, et al., who  can offer us nothing more than whimpering, pouting and foot-stomping.
Cruz is a natural born US citizen because his mother is a natural born citizen. It doesn’t matter where you were born. 
This article must’ve been written by the political hacks at the DNC, because it’s content has been copy / pasted straight out of their playbook.
Mos t people want the ACA repealed in favor of a worthwhile healthcare plan. Obamacare is control and wealth redistribution disguised as healthcare And is designed to bankrupt the Healthcare industry so that the Feds can take full control via a single payor plan.  Think you choices are limited now? 
The bullet points the writer mentone like pre existing conditions,  stay on your parents plan until 26 years of age, etc, would be kept in the new plan. That’s a given.
“Cruz is a natural born US citizen because his mother is a natural born citizen. It doesn’t matter where you were born.
This article must’ve been written by the political hacks at the DNC, because it’s content has been copy / pasted straight out of their playbook.”
Did you NOT read the part where the author is saying Cruz is an American citizen and that it shouldn’t be a story?  No, you didn’t.  You went headlong into this article like the ideological conservative hack that you are, already having a statement prepared, even if it had nothing to do with what was written.
“Cruz needs insurance, and he and his wife could either purchase a wildly expensive private plan, or they, like many Americans, could get it through Cruz’s status as a U.S. senator” 
Thank you for this unintentional hilarity. 
Just how many Americans can get insurance through status as a U.S. senator? It really can’t be more than 100 families, one would think. 
“Like many Americans, I am Bill Gates.”
Great to see the libby so-called “progressives” get their panties in a bunch over this.
Mosty libbies know Cruz is eligible for President. The issue is calling out the same conservatives who to this day think Obama is not eligible for the SAME EXACT REASONS they think Cruz IS eligible.  Even if Obama was born in Kenya (he wasn’t), his mother was still born in Wichita.  Period.  Surely conservatives are going to be just as harsh and dedicated to questioning Cruz’s legitimacy as Obama’s, right?  Of course conservatives would NEVER be shameless, outright hypocrites.
Simple. He was NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES! Now if the dumbass didn’t know that before stepping up,,,, Then he needs to STEP OFF! We have enough idiots pretending to run this country as it is, we don’t need some foreign asshole joining the mix.
Sorry Canada, I do think you are a great and cool country, but please restrain your idiots!
Don’t worry,l there’s plenty of time to focus on all the crazy Cruz crap. His Obamacare coverage and citizenship are low hanging fruit.
Cruz should buy a “wildly expensive” private health plan.  Principle demands it.

As a committee operating under USC Program Board, Concerts Committee was created to serve the programming needs of the undergraduate student body. Concerts Committee firmly believes in access to live music being a programming need of undergraduate students, which is why we work so hard to bring students the best live music we possibly can. USC explains that the programming fee, which funds Concerts Committee, “allows Program Board to plan multiple social, political, and educational events for the USC community.” For the $60 students pay each semester in their tuition and fees, funding is split between the Executive Cabinet, Senate and Program Board. Program Board is given the responsibility for planning programming to benefit those same students — that includes programming and events by various committees and assemblies. To clarify, each student’s $60 is split between each of the three branches and then further divided among the Program Board committees and assemblies, leaving only a limited amount for each to work with. The task is daunting; by paying this fee, USC students have the completely warranted expectation that their programming fees will be spent to benefit them and their peers.
And so each year, Concerts Committee resolves to do the nearly impossible: to book the best talent for the best price to satisfy the music tastes of each and every USC student.
The annual budget of Concerts Committee is not used only on talent costs, however. Most USC students do not know that it costs $42.90 to turn off sprinklers in McCarthy Quad and $66 to turn Doheny Fountain on and off. Sunk costs like these FMS fees, artist riders and CSC hourly rates are also derived from this same annual budget, consequently leaving fewer and fewer dollars remaining to book artists. And when it comes to booking other acts, we run into issues like radius clauses. These clauses prevent artists from playing shows for a certain amount of time before and after an existing festival performance and within a specified physical radius from the venue. The logic behind this stems from wanting to prevent the cannibalism of an artist’s audience.
But when Concerts Committee actually begins to seek artists for shows, we consistently run into various roadblocks from outside the University’s purview. For transparency’s sake, our booking process is roughly the following: 1) Concerts Committee’s executive board and general committee compile a master list of artists; 2) we cross-reference those artists and eliminate impossibilities (derived from touring conflicts, radius clauses, etc.); 3) booking agents are contacted, and Concerts Committee receives artist quotes; 4) we consult our annual budget to determine feasibility; 5) we confirm that these artists align with our constituency’s wants and values; 6) we submit artist proposals to the University’s administration; 7) upon approval, we submit a formal, time-sensitive offer letter to the artist and wait for a response and 8) we negotiate back and forth with the artist and management. If at any point in these 8 steps we encounter disapproval of terms or a legal impasse, Concerts Committee goes back to square one.
One of the most common issues Concerts Committee faces in securing talent is artist quotes surging to unaffordable heights. In October 2013, Dan Morgan-Russell for the Daily Trojan reported that USC’s student government had “a budget of almost $1.89 million. Berkeley has a budget of $1.64 million, Stanford a budget of $3 million, and UCLA a budget of $5.54 million. The Pac-12 average is $2.03 million.” Artists and their management make the assumption that USC’s budget for artists is astronomically higher than it actually is. Because of this delusion, we often receive quotes that are two or three times higher than quotes for other schools.
This all leads to the question of what the undergraduate student body can do to help. It’s simple: get involved in USG and support the motions for nominal increases in the programming fee that appropriately adjust for inflation.
Despite all the hurdles in our way, Concerts Committee is steadfastly committed to bringing only the best live music to USC, and we’ll see you on April 4 for Springfest!

Public Relations Director of Concerts Committee

Today, it seems that everyone and their mother is doing yoga, but yoga surely does not come cheap. In cities throughout the U.S., studios like Yoga to the People are making it their mission to make yoga accessible for everyone, regardless of experience or income. These types of studios offer classes that cater to yogis of all levels, while running purely off of donations, with a suggested donation of $10. There are no memberships, registration fees, or fixed class fees — students are just asked to give what they can.
Though the Los Angeles and USC communities are certainly not new to the popularization that yoga has received as of recent, the new University Park-based studio, Radha Yoga, intends on providing yoga for the pure sake of yoga.
The small, second story studio opened its doors just a few months ago, in the building directly adjacent to popular student study spot, Nature’s Brew. Sunlight floods the room in the daytime, but provides for a calming sense of tranquility come dusk. With its hardwood floors and bare white walls, Radha’s facility remains scaled down and minimalistic. The focus is on yoga and its benefits: deep breathing, strong poses and good vibes.
For beginners and seasoned yogis alike, Radha’s mission is to provide yoga for all. In this moment in time, with yoga having been so sensationalized, studios like Radha and Yoga to the People make an effort to revive the fundamental values that yoga was built upon: the first being that everyone should be able to enjoy yoga’s benefits, and the second being that it shouldn’t drain your cash. At Radha, the emphasis is on giving what you can, in both donation and practice. Following yogi tradition, an instructor is never supposed to charge for lessons. Rather, a student is expected to offer a gift.
Classes are offered for all levels, and due to the studio’s size, students are able to receive a great deal of personal attention. The instructors at Radha make it a priority to get to know their students, whether it’s by learning their names or by familiarizing with the way they move.
Among the classes offered are Vinyasa Flow, Hatha, Sri Sri, Yin and Restorative Yoga. Some classes are more focused on rest and healing while others are more physically demanding (a full schedule with descriptions is posted online). Radha encourages that its students explore a variety of practices while finding a class that works well for them. The instructors are eager to guide beginners through their first classes and because the studio is still fairly new, classes are very small in size.
So whether you’re looking for a new studio or are looking for a pressure-free environment to take your first class, perhaps stop by Radha for a class. Mats are available for rental at $2 and yoga blocks and water is provided. Namaste!

I don’t think you can really call yourself a study abroad student (in Europe, that is) unless you’ve known some of the horrors of flying budget airlines, particularly the kingpin of them all – Ryanair.
Last weekend, I was formally indoctrinated into study abroad lifestyle when I checked in (online, of course, to avoid the 70 euro in-person check-in fee at the airport) for a flight from Madrid to Dublin. With budget airlines, you might save on the initial ticket fee, but you can easily make up the difference in extra charges. Luckily my round-trip flight went without many major glitches – but still an experience to say the least.
I left my apartment with ample time. Friends had warned me that it was important to get to the gate early so that I could be one of the first to board since there is no order. “Be an aggressive East Coaster,” one friend advised me regarding Ryanair’s nonsensical boarding process that allows everyone to board at once, regardless of seat position.
Luckily, I still got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. I secured my place towards the front of the line, and avoided any issues with unavailable cabin space or being told I needed to check my bag. I wasn’t about to check my belongings if it wasn’t necessary. I didn’t want to risk the possibility of lost baggage.
We took a shuttle to the plane and some genius decided it was a good idea to board passengers from the front and back ends of the plane simultaneously, with no regard to seating location. I squeezed by dozens of other passengers to get to my seat at the rear of the plane although I had boarded from the front, and I squished down into my seat. For once I was thankful for my short legs allowed me to maximize the limited space between seats. My friend on the same flight, who is over six feet tall, didn’t have the same luxury.
For more than two hours, I sat straight up in my seat, which did not recline and had minimal cushion, and ate the sandwich my host mom had packed the night before to avoid the cost of food and beverage on the flight. No complimentary sodas here.
Finally, we landed in Dublin. I exited the airport and breathed a sigh of relief. My first Ryanair flight went without major hitches.
Three days later I returned to the airport, hoping my flight back to Madrid would be as much of a breeze. With practically no line at security I was through in no time, and just had to wait for the gate to be announced – which was about the same time final boarding call was meant to be. As soon as I got the gate number I briskly walked through the airport and secured my spot in the boarding line. After about 20 minutes of waiting (already a slight delay) I got to the desk and encountered a grumpy Ryanair employee bearing bad news.
“Where’s your stamp?” he asked, pointing at my boarding pass.
It was only then that I saw, in extremely fine print, the board pass stated all non-EU residents were required to receive a stamp at the check-in desk before going through security. (Ryanair is the only airline I know of that makes you do this.) He just about was ready to make me go back to the front of the airport to get the stamp, which would have surely made me miss the flight, but just then, another employee with a much nicer disposition told me she could simply sign my boarding pass for me and let me on the flight. So, crisis averted and I got back to Madrid safe and sound.
Stay tuned for my upcoming trip on Wizz Air (yes, that’s a real airline, and yes, I also checked their safety ratings because as much as I’d love to just “wizz” over to Budapest, I also want to get there in one piece). This one might top Ryanair though — they even charge you for carry-on overhead compartment luggage.
