Students on campus voiced their opinions on United States Supreme Court oral arguments regarding California Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, and the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.
A recent ABC News-Washington Post poll reported that 58 percent of Americans support the legalization of same-sex marriage and that more than 81 percent of American adults under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage.
David Cruz, a professor of law at the Gould School of Law, attended the hearings in Washington, D.C. this week as a member of the Supreme Court Bar. He said the youngest generation of voters is more supportive of same-sex marriage because of more frequent portrayals of homosexuality in the media and the greater number of openly gay Americans.
“Familiarity breeds comfort,” Cruz said. “More people who are young now grew up being aware of gay people and knowing gay people. [Also], greater visibility in media, whether in news or popular entertainment, contributes to a social climate where there’s less prejudice towards LGBT people.”
Cruz said that the same-sex marriage debate is different from other social issues in the United States’ past and points to the Washington, D.C. hearings as a pivotal moment in our history.
“The Supreme Court has never decided just how skeptical courts should be when government discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation and has never decided how protective the courts should be against anti-gay discrimination,” Cruz said.  “So, there are a lot of open issues here.”
Cruz said the Supreme Court’s decisions on Prop 8 and DOMA will particularly affect USC students moving into the future.
“Often, people meet the person that they fall in love with and want to marry in college,” Cruz said. “If the court agrees that Prop 8 is unconstitutional, then that option, which same-sex couples don’t currently have in California, would be restored.”
Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center at USC, was on campus when Prop 8 passed in 2008, banning same-sex marriage in California.
“[Many USC students] were shocked because they believed that everyone was very supportive of gay and bisexual people,” Vigil said. “But when you step outside the gates of USC, there are people that hate you because you’re gay.”
Some students are aware of the many possible outcomes that the case can take and hope the Supreme Court will make changes to current policies.
“I am for gay marriage to be legalized,” said Samantha Close, a first-year doctorate student in communication. “Although it sounds like the Supreme Court is more likely to throw out the case due to lack of standing rather than rule on it, which I think is sad since they took all the time to hear it.”
Giuseppe Robalino, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he is against the legalization of same-sex marriage but thinks civil unions should be equal legally.
“The law needs to be fully representative of the population as a whole, and you’re not doing that when you are trying to redefine marriage as it has already been defined in federal code,” Robalino said. “We need to step back and realize that there are two sides to the story and both should be represented. What we do not have room for is hatred on both sides.”
To Lisa O’Kane, a first-year student in the pre-medical post-baccalaureate program, the Court’s decision will have a lasting personal impact.
“I’m gay, and I’d like to get married someday,” O’Kane said. “I think DOMA and Proposition 8 are important cases that need to be heard and reheard. If [the Supreme Court] hears them and goes along with the Constitution, it’ll be a very big day for everyone in America, gay or straight. “
The Supreme Court is not expected to make a ruling on either issue until June.

The Graduate Student Senate overwhelmingly passed a resolution Monday urging the administration and Board of Trustees to create the position of a full-time graduate career counselor who can serve the needs of the graduate student population.
The resolution, which passed with 42 representatives in favor, two abstentions and two opposed, came in response to a growing concern among graduate students that the university is not doing enough to respond to changing dynamics in the job market for those with graduate degrees.
“Because of the increased number of Ph.D. students and professional doctorate students and the decreased number of academic jobs, a lot of people are looking to use their degrees in non-traditional ways — particularly in business — but not necessarily knowing how to translate their skills over,” said GPSS President Yael Adef.
Adef said that though professional schools, such as the Marshall School of Business and the Gould School of Law, often have their own internal career services, there is a need for a centralized career service for the doctoral programs. She said, moreover, that fluctuations in the job market have made people much more interdisciplinary, making it difficult to solely utilize the career services of any one school and increasing the demand for a general counselor to serve across disciplines.
Damian Wang, a doctorate student studying genetic, molecular and cellular biology, who was one of the key figures involved in the passage of the resolution, said the idea to bring a career counselor to the university came while he was interning at the USC Career Center.
“After interning there for the past two years, I noticed that they didn’t really have services for graduate students,” Wang said. “That’s purely because they don’t have the personnel to do so.”
Though there are nine internship and career counselor positions to assist the undergraduate student population, the university does not have any career counselors dedicated solely to graduate students, despite the fact that graduate and professional students outnumber undergraduates by about 3,000 students and that USC is one of only two schools in the US News and World Report Top 25 schools not to have one.
Adef said graduate students who do try to utilize the Career Center services often find that it is not equipped to handle their specific needs.
“Graduate students end up going to the Career Center because they don’t have services for their department and get told the same thing that undergraduates get told, such as ‘Your resume needs to be one page long,’” Adef said. “This is fine if you’re 21 and looking for your first job, but graduate students have publications, they have CVs — their needs are very different from an undergraduate student.”
Outgoing Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said this disparity in career services stems from the conflicting interests that research universities have with respect to their graduate students.
“This is a conundrum for all research universities,” Jackson said. “We recruit [graduate students] because we want them to earn Ph.Ds, to do well in the field, maybe become professors — and so our faculty are trained to replicate themselves.”
Jackson said the university is still figuring out what it can and should do to aid graduate students in their searches for opportunities outside the world of academia, but cited programs already in place at USC, such as the Beyond the Ph.D Career Conference.
John Polansky, co-chair of a graduate student task force created by the graduate school, said surveys of the graduate student population suggest that one of the leading contributors to graduate student stress was worry about job placement. He said the creation of a graduate counselor would go a long way in alleviating some of that stress.
“Graduate students in particular have a hard time talking to their advisors and their professor about getting out of the field, and there is a lot of pressure to go into academia,” Polansky said. “There isn’t a strong resource available to graduate students to discuss the options and explore other avenues, and having a centralized resource such as this would be great.”
Wang said the next step for graduate students is to engage the higher administration to make sure that the issue is addressed.
“Something like this is very revolutionary in terms of the way we think of higher education and what it stands for,” Wang said. “Whether it’s supposed to remain in academia or whether it can branch out into industry and other fields.”
Let’s face it—the engineering, business, law, and other specialized graduate students won’t have any problems. If anyone with a Ph.D. in creative writing, for example, has trouble finding a job, I say good riddance. They should have thought about that before.

Several dozen students listened Wednesday to criminal justice experts and activists, including a former prison inmate, discuss the growing rate of incarceration in California and the social and economic costs of the system.
The panel, held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum, was part of the weekly “Students Talk Back” series, presented in partnership with Dornsife College’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Sol Price’s Tomás Rivera Policy Institute and Sol Price’s Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise.
Crime stats · Panelists Emily Reisner, Jennifer Moore and Sarah Burton (right to left) discuss criminal justice reform Wednesday at The Forum. — Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Tomás Rivera Policy Institute director Roberto Suro moderated the panel.
The discussion began with a brief history of crime rates in California, which peaked in the 1990s. JFA Institute President James Austin, noted that despite a subsequent drop in crime, California’s incarceration rate remained high until its peak in the early 2000s.
“It’s a very expensive system  and so it’s been very difficult to reform it in any substantial way,” Austin said.
A New Way of Life Reentry Program founder Susan Burton, a former inmate and current reformer of the criminal justice system, criticized the current system’s wasted funds spent on inmates who aren’t given a chance when they show the willingness to better themselves.
“To think that these people are denied release over and over and over again and have thoroughly worked on themselves and cannot walk out those doors is a waste of human potential and a waste of resources — our California resources,” said Burton, also the founder of A New Way of Life Reentry Program, a non-profit organization that provides housing and support for formerly incarcerated women.
As someone witnessed this first-hand, Burton emphasized that the focus needs to be put on those individuals being incarcerated in the first place.
“You need to think, ‘Who are you incarcerating?’” Burton said.
According to a study conducted by Jennifer Moore, a graduate student in public policy and Rivera Policy Institute research assistant, the current California prison system houses inmates at nearly 200 percent capacity. Though California has pledged to lower this number to 137 percent capacity by June 30, this number is not projected to be met in time, meaning more money will continue to flow into the prison system.
Austin cautioned the audience about the repercussions that a costly criminal justice system will have on other areas of interest, including education.
“All you students should be aware of this,” Austin said. “The state prison system is taking money away from the higher education system in California.”
Beyond state spending, the panelists highlighted the repercussions that a broken criminal justice system can have on individuals once out of prison, namely the lack of jobs and community respect.
Emily Reisner, a graduate student in public policy who is also a research assistant for the Rivera Policy Institute, said the system fails to encourage rehabilitation into society.
“It’s not only the rap sheet, it’s the stigma around the population that needs to be approached,” Reisner said.

Two attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union taught students about free speech on campus at “Know Your Rights,” a forum hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine and Mecha de USC on Wednesday.
The event, part of Palestine Awareness Week, hosted ACLU attorneys Yaman Salahi and Brendan Hamme at the United University Church. The two pinpointed issues regarding informants and instructed students on their free speech rights before fielding questions from attendees.
The speakers firmly asserted that students have the ability to take advantage of broader free speech rights at USC. Hamme explained and referenced Leonard’s Law, which includes provisions regarding the preservation of free speech on private school campuses and declaratory relief, which allows the court to declare a university policy unconstitutional. Leonard’s Law is only applicable in California.
“If we lied in any other state, this would be an extremely short conversation,” Hamme joked.
The information the speakers gave about free speech on private university campuses was useful to USC students who have had issues with the administration.
Nesma Tawil, president of SJP, said she has run into difficulties when trying to organize events and activities for her organization.
“We get questioned by the administration all the time. We have to go through meetings all the time before every event that we do, and they ask us a lot of questions that I’m sure they don’t do with other organizations,” Tawil said.
Salahi also said people who are contacted by authorities at their homes are not required to answer their questions.
“All you have to do is take their card and say ‘thank you, I’ll have my attorney contact you,’” Salahi said. “Most of the time, it’s because of religious or ethnic background, not because [someone is] suspected of criminal activity.”
Salahi explained that while immigrants might be inclined to invite such officials into their homes in order to prove their innocence, such actions could lead to later complications and uncomfortable situations. He advised students to instead always seek legal counsel, which the ACLU provides for free.
And speaking on a subject close to home for many students, SJP member Dina Sharif stressed the importance of the equitable free speech grounds at private institutions such as USC.
“Students at USC — particularly because it’s a private university — don’t realize what the Leonard Law is or how connected we are in terms of law and policy to public institutions,” Sharif said.
Tawil also noted that though other events of the week might spread awareness to those not involved in organizations dedicated to the Middle East conflict, the panel offered a different type of awareness to active members by providing practical legal information.
“I find there [are] a lot of students who are unknowledgeable of their rights. Because we’re students at a private university, they think we don’t have as [many] rights as UCLA or other UCs,” Tawil said. “We want to build confidence in these students to express their views in an academic environment, which should be the most comfortable place for freedom of speech.”

With the amount of success the No. 4 USC women’s sand volleyball team has had this season, it’s hard to believe this is only its second year of competitive collegiate play. The program still has that new car smell, but even newer is the team’s Merle Norman Stadium, which opened this season. Though the paint has just barely dried, the Women of Troy have already posted an impressive 7-3 record at home this season, with those three losses coming at the hands of No. 1 Long Beach State, No. 3 Florida State and Pepperdine. Now USC must take their show on the road to finish the regular season strong.
Though the Trojans have posted wins against some of the top teams in the nation, including No. 5 Hawai’i and No. 9  Nebraska, they have yet to defeat any of these top three teams in regular season play this year. However, they will get that chance in their next couple of matches.
After losing to defending champion Pepperdine 4-1 in USC’s last regular season home match, the team now has to go on the road and play No. 2 Long Beach State (6-1). USC will be looking to get revenge after the 49ers narrowly ousted the Trojans 3-2 at Merle Norman Stadium on Mar. 16. The match was the second half of a doubleheader for USC after defeating Loyola Marymount previously.
The loss to the 49ers really was as close as the score indicated, and the match was ultimately decided by only a few points. USC posted wins in the No. 2- and No. 3-ranked matches, while Long Beach State went on to win the No. 1- and No. 5-ranked matches. This left the No. 4-ranked match to decide the dual, where USC’s Brooke Fournier and Natasha Siljkovic fell to Long Beach State’s Lauren Minkel and Jocelyn Neely in the only 3-setter of the dual, 21-18, 20-22, 12-15.
“We’ve been coming really close in these big matches,” USC head coach Anna Collier said. “We lost to No. 2 Long Beach State and No. 3 Florida State, both in five sets, so we just have to lock down, take care of our side of the court and play every point like it’s our last.”
For Long Beach State, both their No. 4- and No. 5-ranked pairs remain unbeaten through seven matches. Minkel and Neely have made a team-high 195 combined digs while going 6-0 in the fourth slot, while Tyler Jackson and Janisa Johnson are hitting .471 with just 29 errors through six matches.
Long Beach State’s only loss this year came to top-ranked Pepperdine, who defeated the 49ers in the American Volleyball Coaches Association collegiate sand volleyball national championship last year.
“I hope we can use the Pepperdine match as a learning experience for this upcoming dual against Long Beach State,” Collier said. “We don’t want to have that same feeling of defeat that we had against Pepperdine.”
The Women Of Troy will also get another shot at the undefeated Waves, as they travel to Malibu to play them again on April 6.
However, the first order of the business for the team is today’s dual against Long Beach State, a team that USC is 1-2 against all-time, having split duals in 2012. First serve is set for 1 p.m.

After failing in its attempt at a third-straight victory, the USC men’s golf team returns to action at the Stanford Intercollegiate today hungry for a win. The squad finished 10th among tough competition earlier this month at the Southern Highland Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas, where No. 1 California claimed an easy victory, defeating second-place Alabama by 13 strokes. Stanford’s Patrick Rodgers took the individual championship after defeating New Mexico’s James Erkenbeck and Alabama’s Cory Whitsett in a playoff.
Senior Sam Smith’s 3-over 219 led the No. 9 Trojans, but his tie for 16th could not match the excellent play of the Golden Bears, who placed four players in the top 11. Fortunately, three teams that finished ahead of USC in Las Vegas are ranked in the top five nationally, while all teams, except host UNLV, ranked in the top 25.
This week’s tournament will provide an excellent opportunity to get back on track after a two-week hiatus. None of the nation’s top-five teams, of which three are Pac-12 rivals, have entered, seemingly opening the door for a USC victory if the team can get by the host Cardinal, ranked No. 10 in the nation. USC head coach Chris Zambri is optimistic about the team’s chances.
“We are excited to get up to Palo Alto,” Zambri said. “We love that golf course, as it fits our style of play really well.”
This was apparent in 2012, when the Trojans finished a close second behind Oregon in the tournament and ahead of Stanford, UCLA and Washington. Zambri, now in his seventh year at the helm of the program, knows the importance of the last few tournaments before Pac-12 playoffs and NCAA regionals and will not overlook this event.
“This is the time of year we need to be at our best,” Zambri said. “These are the most important two months of the season.”
The Trojans have shown great potential at several points this season, picking up consecutive team victories in late February at the Prestige Tournament and North Ranch Intercollegiate. It was also at North Ranch that freshman Yi Keun Chang picked up the team’s only individual victory of the season.
The Trojans will need continued brilliance from Chang, consistent play from sophomore Anthony Paolucci and junior Ramsey Sahyoun and leadership from senior Sam Smith to finish the season strong. Coach Zambri has faith that his players will be able to do just that.
“[Assistant Coach John] Wurzer and I both think the guys are ready to step up,” Zambri said. “The break came at a perfect time for us. Our guys got to slow down and recharge a bit.”
With the ultra-competitive Pac-12 championships only a month away, the team needs to rediscover its late-February form. After this week’s tournament, the Trojans will return to Northern California for the Western Intercollegiate in Santa Cruz, Calif. in mid-April. Later in the month, the squad will battle for first place in the nation’s toughest conference at Los Angeles Country Club. Last year’s third-place result at Pac-12 championships shows that the team has what it takes to meet the challenge.
“I’m really excited,” Paolucci said. “I know we all are ready to test the best teams in the country.”

After an all-too-forgettable spring break, the USC baseball team looks to do just that and put a dreadful past week behind it as it begins a three-game series against Cal.
Learning curve · Freshman pitcher Brent Wheatley has posted an ERA of 4.08 and is allowing hitters to hit .329 against him this season. — Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The Trojans went just 2-6 over the break, with wins against No. 16 Oregon and Washington, but dropped a pair to each of those schools, as well as No. 4 Louisville.
It’s hard to decide what ailed the Trojans (9-15, 2-4) more over that week: the mere 29 runs they scored — an average of 3.625 per game — or the 50 runs they allowed — an average of 6.25 per game. Though it’s unreasonable to expect a team to score seven runs to win a game, it’s equally problematic when a pitching staff is forced to hold opponents to just three runs in order to have a chance to win. Clearly, this puts the Trojans in a tough position.
As such, USC head coach Dan Hubbs said, after the team’s lone practice of the week Tuesday, that his team simply must put more runs across the plate.
“We need to hit with runners in scoring position,” Hubbs said. “We had plenty of opportunities with men in scoring position [last week], we just didn’t get the job done.”
USC hit barely .225 with runners in scoring position over break and hit into nine double plays — four in one game against Oregon. The Trojans have talked all season long about the need to be patient and not to press at the plate, but the results simply haven’t been there. Hubbs has said repeatedly that pitchers throw differently when there’s a runner in scoring position, but his hitters have yet to adjust.
“With men in scoring position we need to be able to handle multiple, different pitches,” Hubbs said. “We’re kind of in between pitches right now, and what I mean by that is the fastball is beating us and the off-speed has us out in front. We need to be able to square multiple pitches in order to be able to score runs.”
It can be hard not to press at the plate, however, when the Trojans are finding themselves the victims of big innings and spotty defense while in the field. Against Oregon, USC committed a downright laughable 10 errors over the weekend set. Things got a little better in the field against Louisville, but not on the mound, as the Trojans gave up a four and a six-run inning in their 13-6 loss on Tuesday.
Comparing the stats of the Trojans and the Bears (15-10, 4-2) shows that Hubbs is dead on in his assessment of USC’s struggles. As teams, their season statistics are almost identical. Their on-base and slugging percentages are nearly equal, and Cal has 222 hits on the season compared to USC’s 220. The Trojans actually have a higher batting average on the year.
But the difference comes in runs scored. Cal has scored 114 runs off of 107 RBI this year. USC has a mere 87 runs off 80 RBI. They both create the scoring opportunities, but, unlike the Trojans, the Bears capitalize. Just one player on USC has double-digit RBI in junior infielder James Roberts. Cal has three, led by first baseman Devon Rodriguez and preseason All-American catcher Andrew Knapp, both slugging close to .500 with an on-base percentage approaching .400. It will be imperative for the pitching staff to avoid mistakes when these two are at the plate.
Tonight’s 7 p.m. game will be the first-ever night game at Berkeley’s Evans Diamond. First pitch for Friday’s game is at 6 p.m.. The Saturday finale is at noon, which will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.

Spring break could not have come at a better time for the USC men’s volleyball team, which has struggled mightily of late, dropping five of its last six games.
But with only six games remaining in the regular season, the Trojans return to action and must now make the final push if they hope to reach the playoffs.
USC entered its spring break on a bit of an upswing after a win over No. 3 Pepperdine. Although the Trojans had dropped the previous two games of their three-game homestand, the win over the Waves gave them plenty to celebrate.
Pepperdine took the early lead with a first-set victory, but USC would mount a comeback. The Trojans responded in grand fashion, taking the next three sets and defeating the Waves 19-25, 25-19, 27-25, 25-18.
The match’s most exciting moment came at the end of the third set, when USC scored three consecutive points to win the set after Pepperdine had forced a set point.
“Last week was great,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “I thought the team practiced with a real sense of urgency with everything they did. We’ve been talking about winning on the court and working on our communication as a team on the floor, and I thought we executed a lot better.”
Recently, the Trojans’ main focus for practice has been its service game. Though USC has been more conservative at the service line in past years, the team has shifted to a more aggressive attack. Sophomores Micah Christenson and Cristian Rivera have thrived under this new strategy, combining for 55 aces on the season thus far.
But though the Trojans are now ranked among the top teams in the nation in aces, their aggressive serving has also brought a rise in service errors.
It is for this reason that Ferguson looks to make some adjustments to his team’s approach.
“We need to be better with our ace-to-errors ratio,” Ferguson said. “As a team we’re OK but not great, and that’s being carried by two guys. So we’re going to dial the rest of the guys back a bit.”
But USC is going to need more than just a good serving game if they want to beat Cal Baptist on Thursday. The Lancers, who currently sit in the very playoff spot the Trojans wish to claim, have won four of their last five matches and have risen to seventh in the NCAA rankings.
The recent success of this Cal Baptist squad largely rests on its dangerous pair of outside hitters, sophomore Guilherme Koepp and senior Levi Cabral, both from Brazil. The duo has taken control of recent matches with powerful serving and looks to be a major obstacle in USC’s road to the playoffs.
“We’re always focusing on serving and passing, and that’s going to be a huge key,” Ferguson said. “Their two outside hitters are among two of the best servers in the league. If we can keep those guys at bay, or at least control what they’re doing a little bit more, then I think we’re going to be alright.”
Regardless of Trojans’ change in approach, the loss of Ben Lam makes the playoff hunt significantly more challenging. Late in the second match against Hawai’i, the sophomore middle blocker blew out his ankle and now appears to be out for the season. Now, freshman Josh Kirchner must take the place of the injured Lam, who was one of the team’s defensive leaders.
With only a handful of games remaining in the regular season, the Trojans must play their best volleyball to continue into the postseason. After Cal Baptist, USC will head to Utah to face top-ranked BYU before returning to the Galen Center for their final two home games.

Wednesday’s pro day has come and gone, and with it the bulk of the gauntlet that is NFL draft preparation is now, for the most part, finished.
Sure, interviews and private team meetings remain, but for Matt Barkley and the rest of the USC prospects, the case has been made as to where they deserve to be drafted come April.
Ever since USC’s 2012 season mercifully came to an end, no prospect not named Manti Te’o has been combed over and dissected more than Barkley, whose shoulder injury and relatively shaky senior season have casted doubt as to whether he’s deserving of being the top-ranked quarterback prospect or even a first-round draft pick.
So where does Barkley deserve to go? His career definitely ended on a downward trend, but his 2012 numbers rank among the top 20 in most categories, including passer rating and touchdowns.
But those same numbers were drastically worse across the board in comparison to those from his junior season, particularly in the interception department, where Barkley posted a career-worst 15 picks last season.
Still, for all the flak Barkley received because of last year’s performance, this is the Pac-12’s most productive quarterback, and nearly every other school would love its signal-caller to have a season like Barkley had last year. USC fans might have been too spoiled with his superb junior season to fully appreciate all he did last year.
So where should Barkley go in the draft? Many scouts currently rank West Virginia’s Geno Smith ahead of Barkley, though both are ranked no higher than 15th among all prospects. Smith’s perceived edge over Barkley comes from his mobility and his arm strength. Though he wasn’t a runner in college, Smith’s 40 time of 4.59 is miles ahead of Barkley’s, which floats somewhere near five seconds.
To me, what separates the two is competition. Smith played his first two seasons as a starter in the Big East, which ranked No. 8 in ESPN ’s final 2011 conference power rankings. The Pac-12 finished No. 2 that year. Last season, West Virginia competed in the Big XII, which ranked No. 3 in the final regular season power rankings, one spot behind the Pac-12.
Furthermore, in the last two NFL drafts, the Big East had 21 defensive players chosen. By comparison, the Pac-12 saw 31 of its defensive players taken in the last two years, evidence that Barkley, a four-year starter, faced more top-tier talent across the line of scrimmage during his career than Smith, who started his last three seasons in Morgantown.
To me, Barkley is the clear choice as the top quarterback prospect. The scouts may never come to terms with his relatively short 6-foot-2 ½ or his less-than-stellar arm strength and questionable decision-making at times, but few college players went through more adversity and scrutiny than Barkley did over the course of his career. And, Barkley will undoubtedly wow coaches and executives during the interview process in the coming weeks, which will surely boost his stock even further.
Then there is the chaos that is draft day. Teams always get antsy in the minutes leading up to their pick, making their decisions particularly unpredictable. Coaches and general managers are always looking for a franchise quarterback, and it would not surprise me in the least if a team fell in love with the idea of making Barkley the face of the franchise enough to trade up and use a mid-to-high first-round pick on him.
Teams like Minnesota and Cleveland come to mind, franchises whose current starting quarterbacks are on thin ice and haven’t experienced much success of late. But another possibility is a team like the Houston Texans, whose starting quarterback, Matt Schaub, will be 32 when next season begins and was solid but unspectacular last season.
The Texans are a run-oriented team, and many analysts believe the only thing that separated them from the NFL elites is a good quarterback. In the 2012 NFL postseason, many pundits asserted that Schaub’s inability to pose a threat to opposing defenses was the reason the Texans were eliminated in the AFC divisional round.
Barkley might just be the guy they are missing, and with Schaub signed through the next four seasons, the Texans would not have to rush Barkley into a starting role prematurely.
All this is speculation, of course, and when the Chiefs go on the clock with the No. 1 pick on April 25, mayhem could ensue, throwing all this speculation out the window. Wherever Barkley lands, be it Buffalo or Arizona or anywhere else, my guess is that he’ll make whichever coach who takes a chance on him look like a very smart man when all is said and done.

West Virginia is no longer a member of the Big East.  They played in the Big 12 this last season.

After a near-perfect regular season, the USC men’s swim team heads into this year’s NCAA championships in Indianapolis with high expectations and an even stronger desire to improve on its past finishes.
The Trojans finished in seventh place in the 2012 NCAA championships and are coming off of a third-place showing in this year’s Pac-12 championships.
Finish line · USC’s No. 4 men’s swim and dive team has put in a stellar regular season, but the slate will be wiped clean in Indianapolis. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Though finishing third in the stacked Pac-12 and earning a bid to the NCAA championships would be a satisfying accomplishment for most swim teams in the nation, USC head coach Dave Salo is not content.
“USC has a long tradition of competing at the NCAA championships,” Salo said. “Our expectations are not to qualify but rather to compete for a top-five finish year-in and year-out.”
This season, the Trojans might just have the right pieces in place to make a run for the title. Led by senior Alex Lendrum, the squad features 11 swimmers who, as Salo suggests, have the capability to win every freestyle event and relay this year.
Along with Lendrum, USC features experienced swimmers in juniors Vladimir Morozov and Dimitri Colupaev along with sophomore Cristian Quintero, who has been especially impressive in his relay events this season.
Most recently, Quintero erased a huge deficit in the 800-yard relay in the Pac-12 championships and allowed the Trojans to win that race while posting a school record-time of 6:16.88.
Though the Trojan roster is smaller than most other schools competing in the NCAA championships, the talent found among the 11 swimmers might just be enough to make up for the lack of depth. One of the biggest and most decorated contributors to this pool of talent is Morozov, a bronze medalist for his native Russia in the 2012 London Olympics.
“I think everyone is anticipating the performance of Vlad Morozov, who has dominated the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle throughout the year,” Salo said of his star swimmer. “Everyone wants to know just how fast he can go. The NCAA records are in reach.”
Though the Trojans have one of the most dangerous squads in the nation, Salo, who also coaches the women’s swimming team, knows there are many stumbling blocks on the way to a championship.
“The biggest challenge is staying healthy and balancing the energy needed to get through the intensity of the meet,” Salo said. “We can’t have any mistakes — the competition is too tough.”
The women’s team realized just how costly a mistake could be last week, when a disqualification in the 400-yard freestyle relay cost the team a top-four finish in Indianapolis. The key for the men, especially with such a small roster, certainly seems to be mental focus and preparation.
The Trojans, currently ranked No. 4 in the nation, will have some tough competition to contend with this weekend. Texas, Michigan and Pac-12 champion California stand between the Trojans and the top spot in the rankings, while No. 7 Stanford cannot be counted out after coming ahead of USC by an impressive 161.5 points at the Pac-12 championships.
“Michigan and Cal present the biggest team challenge with the depth of their teams,” Salo said. “Each have 18 swimmers competing against our 11. That depth can be used to rest some athletes against ours that will have to race hard more often.”
USC has had a history of dominance at the NCAA championships but, since 2007, this success has been elusive for the Trojans. From 2001 to 2007, the Trojans won at least one title in every NCAA championship, but no USC men’s swimmer or relay team has won any sort of title in the finals since then. And while the Trojans have won nine NCAA team titles, good for fourth in the nation, they haven’t won a team championship since 1977.
“We are on the verge of regaining the national prominence our teams enjoyed in the 1970s,” Salo said. “Our expectation is to challenge for a top spot this year.”
The road ahead for the Trojans in Indianapolis will not be easy by any means, but with a confident coach and energized swimmers, an NCAA title seems to be in reach. The Trojans begin their quest for the championship today, and the meet will run through Saturday. The finals events on Friday and Saturday will be streamed live online on ESPN3 beginning at 4 p.m. PST.

For the first time in nearly four months, personnel from the NFL were able to evaluate former USC quarterback Matt Barkley in person on Wednesday.
Make an impression · Quarterback Matt Barkley was the main focus of scouts, who are trying to determine if he’s worthy of a first-round pick. – Daily Trojan File Photo
After having missed the last game of the regular season against Notre Dame and the Sun Bowl against Georgia Tech because of a shoulder sprain suffered in the game against UCLA, Barkley took the field with several former Trojans at USC’s pro day workout on Cromwell Field.
Barkley threw to several familiar targets, including wide receiver Robert Woods and running back Curtis McNeal, while receiving snaps from center Khaled Holmes. Joining in the workout were former Trojan tight end Dominique Byrd and receiver Brandon Carswell.
For Barkley, it was a refreshing change to be back at the school where he spent four years after spending the last two months training Florida.
“It was a great day to come out here and throw the ball around,” Barkley said. “It feels good to be back at ’SC’s campus throwing like this.”
Barkley threw about 60 passes on the day, including passes down the sideline and across the middle of the field, completing 55 of his 60 throws. He also did agility drills and ran the 40-yard dash, clocking in a time of 4.93.
The quarterback, who holds the Pac-12 record for career touchdown passes, was pleased with his overall performance, though he wasn’t completely satisfied.
“You always try to be perfect, especially on a day like this,” Barkley said.
He also pointed out that though today was important, it was not the end-all, be-all for anyone assessing his skills.
“I think a lot of the proof is in the tape. That’s where [scouts and NFL teams] look first,” Barkley said. “I think today was just proof that I still have an arm and I still [can] throw and make those passes down the field.”
Joining the offensive stars were several defenders, including safety T.J. McDonald, cornerback Nickell Robey, safety Jawanza Starling and defensive end Wes Horton. Horton, who was not invited to the NFL combine last month, was motivated to show scouts what he is capable of.
“I am happy with how it went,” Horton said. “I just came out here, showed I was fluid in my runs and all my cone drills.”
Horton said that he’s been working on his strength and explosion since the Sun Bowl.
“Just getting in that squat rack, doing a lot of sets of squats, lunges, all that stuff because I feel like I could be more explosive of a ball player,” he said. “… I want to be able to show that I have the strength to play at the next level.”
The majority of the players ran 40-yard dashes, did cone drills and participated in individual position drills as well. Notable 40 times included Robey’s 4.44 and Horton’s 4.87. The former also notched a 40.5-inch vertical leap, which would have placed him third among cornerbacks at the 2013 NFL combine.
Woods and McDonald did not run, opting to stand on their times from the combine, though they did do shuttle and cone drills. For many of the players, it will be the last time they will get to showcase themselves in front of potential employers.
That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, however, as many of the tests are somewhat tedious. Veteran center Holmes was one of the happier ones to be done with all the drills.
“I did well. It was fun. It felt like there was a little weight lifted,” Holmes said. “I don’t think I have to run another 40 ever again, so I’m looking forward to [not having to do] that.”
The draft will take place from April 25-27 in New York City. With about a month left to go before the big day, Barkley is not yet sure where he’s going to take in the experience, and doesn’t seem too concerned about it, either.
“I haven’t figured that out yet,” Barkley said.

With the upcoming premieres of The Host and Game of Thrones, fans of science fiction and fantasy are prepared to see some of literature’s hottest titles portrayed on the screen.
Whatever your opinions on Stephenie Meyer or George R. R. Martin, it’s undeniable that the fantasy and science fiction genres have a large market for readers, cinephiles and television lovers alike. This year has already seen the theatrical releases of Beautiful Creatures and Oz the Great and Powerful. And promises of a December 2014 release for the second installment of The Hobbit trilogy have die-hard fans of J. R. R. Tolkien writhing in anticipation.
But what gives science fiction and fantasy their cultural staying power? Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings series debuted in England in 1954, but when Peter Jackson’s cinematic interpretation of The Fellowship of the Ring hit screens in 2001, the film grossed $872 million worldwide. And that figure doesn’t take into consideration the sum already earned by Tolkien’s other Middle-earth novels and subsequent  film adaptations.
Similarly, the first installment of Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series was published in 1996, yet is just meeting Hollywood success with HBO’s premiere of Game of Thrones in 2011. Still, the second season of Game of Thrones, according to The Hollywood Reporter, averaged 10.3 million viewers per episode (just to compare, HBO’s series Girls averaged only 4.2 million viewers). Naturally, with both Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings possessing large fanbases and grand financial successes, it’s safe to say that time hasn’t rendered either work irrelevant.
Perhaps audiences are drawn to fantastical literary texts because of their penchant for chronicling human experiences in new worlds. Tolkien, for example, created a depth-defying history of his fictional Middle-earth and even drew on his background in linguistics to invent multiple languages, such as Dwarvish and Entish, for his universe. Elvish, perhaps the most famous of Tolkien’s languages, remains fully functional, and the most dedicated Tolkien readers can carry a conversation in Quenya and Sindarin.
Yet The Fellowship of the Ring, despite Frodo Baggins’ 50-ish age in the book, still contains a quasi-coming-of-age-story as the hobbit Frodo embarks on a trek to take the ring of Sauron to Mordor — a big deal, since hobbits don’t usually have adventures.
“I should think [it would be very difficult to find anyone to share in an adventure] — in these parts!” says hobbit Bilbo Baggins in the prequel to Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings series, The Hobbit. “We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!”
But as Frodo begins to confront his own simultaneous thirst for adventure and anxiety about handling the dark powers of the ring, Tolkien’s novel quickly becomes an exploration of moral issues — issues common even among those of us who don’t happen to live in Middle-earth.
“The great thing about fantasy is that you can drag dreams and longings and hopes and fears and strivings out of your subconscious and call them ‘magic’ or ‘dragons’ or ‘faeries’ and get to know them better,” reads a famous quote by fantasy writer Robin McKinley. “But then, I write the stuff. Obviously I’m prejudiced.”
McKinley, known for her retellings of Beauty and the Beast in her novels Beauty: A Retelling of  the Story of Beauty and the Beast and Rose Daughter, as well as her newly invented worlds in Sunshine and The Blue Sword, has a clear-cut vision of humanity’s ongoing presence in fictional universes.
Her 2003 novel Sunshine, for example, follows the tale of Rae “Sunshine” Seddon as she befriends a supposedly dangerous vampire Constantine. Though McKinley’s novel takes place in a world dominated by humans, the politics of the universe as we know it have changed. The Voodoo Wars, fought between humans and “Others”  — vampires, demons and werewolves, have left “bad spots” in Rae’s world, places where dark magic thrives. When Rae decides to embrace her own magical abilities, however, the novel quickly turns into a classic case of good versus evil.
There’s only one problem: How do you distinguish between the two?
“The rose shadows said that they loved the sun, but that they also loved the dark, where their roots grew through the lightless mystery of the earth,” writes McKinley in Sunshine. “The roses said: You do not have to choose.”
In her lyrical prose and fantastical metaphors, McKinley proves that fantasy and science fiction offer effective starting grounds for investigating the human condition. Her characters, even if they are not entirely human, explore what it means to love, the nature of responsibility and the intricate workings of friendships — all themes that find relevance even in novels that are more grounded in realism.
Without the restrictions of working within realistic realms, however, authors can find a never-ending avenue for defining humanity in ways that might not be expressed in more conventional forms. Magic suddenly becomes an expression of responsibility. Vampires, goblins and werewolves become metaphors for the monsters within ourselves. And, even if an author is just pushing the limits of his or her imagination, communicating the more uncomfortable facets of reality becomes easier as the fantastical world gives us some distance from themes we might not be ready to discuss.
Perhaps, once again, McKinley says it best in Sunshine: “I like that: a little pressure on the understood boundaries of yourself … See what kind of a pretzel you can tie yourself into and press on the understood.”

In Rossini’s Cinderella, the prince (with the short, somewhat stocky stature of a tenor) is most likely not the man that girls dream about. The mice (or in this case, large rats) are not cute and cuddly sidekicks. And Cinderella (or La Cenerentola, as she answers to) might never don a glass slipper or sit in a pumpkin carriage.
But, the opera’s focus on character development, rather than iconic imagery, is perhaps why the production, which opened last weekend at the LA Opera, so effortlessly seeps into your heart.
With just the right touch of madcap humor, social commentary and whimsical interpretation, this rendition of Cinderella, brought to life by director Joan Font and conductor James Conlon, dazzles as an enlightened departure from the tale you grew up with.
The story begins when the prince’s tutor, Alidoro (Nicola Ulivieri), disguised as a beggar, knocks on the home of Don Magnifico (Alessandro Corbelli). Though the two wicked stepsisters, Clorinda (Stacey Tappan) and Tisbe (Ronnita Nicole Miller), turn him away, Cinderella (Kate Lindsey) takes pity on Alidoro and gives him bread and coffee.
Touched by Cinderella’s kindness, Alidoro tells Don Ramiro (Rene Barbera) about his encounter. Intrigued, Don Ramiro decides to switch places with his valet, Dandini (Vito Priante), and judge for himself whether she might be a worthy bride.
It is clear that Priante is having fun in the role of valet-turned prince. He shines as he plays off of Barbera’s energy, and there is a gleeful lilt to his voice as he orders Don Ramiro around for a change, making him pick up his hat and follow his commands.
Priante holds court on the stage when he makes the audience laugh, but Barbera stands out through his persual of Cinderella. By taking the time to get to know her and observing her everyday life, it is easy to believe Don Ramiro when he sings that he is falling in love.
Barbera certainly knows what he is doing in this role. Though Don Ramiro is a prince, Barbera  has a certain sweet, sympathetic quality about him that makes the audience root for his character to end up with Cinderella. Their romance feels like a slow burn, which is a notable task to accomplish in an opera that moves at a piano forte pace.
The rapid pace is necessary, however, for the over-the-top scale of the opera. In an effort to enhance the absurdity of courtier life, the performance carries a grandiose element to it. That is aided by the ridiculous, almost art-deco feel of the costumes. Cinderella’s stepsisters, Clorinda and Tisbe, for example, (wearing giant wigs shaded highlighter pink and sunshine yellow) are textbook examples of the absurd fashion worn in court.
Tappan and Miller play it up by flaunting their ballooning undergarments, which give the stepsisters an almost cartoonish hourglass figures.
The rats truly steal the show, though, with their large rodent costumes and even larger personalities. Cinderella’s companions are always in the background, playing with the props, sampling the food and just generally behaving as rats would. They have the audience in the palm of their hands and they know it, too. Two of the rats stay on stage after the curtain for intermission falls and pull their tails above their eyes in a pretense of modesty. But even the giant pink tails cannot disguise their glee from being in the spotlight.
The rats do not serve solely as comedic relief, however. Operas  traditionally serve as commentaries on class; rats, quite possibly the lowest creature imaginable in society, are far enough removed from the inside to shine a light on the absurdity of society. With their clever eyes and lithe movements, they are the Greek chorus of this opera — always observing court life and the people who take part in it and inviting the audience to share with them in the joke.
Cinderella is the moral center of the play and because of that, her part falls a little flat.  Though Lindsey plays Cinderella beautifully — her mezzo-soprano voice is strong and sympathetic throughout the performance and her acting feels genuine —  the character does not have exciting costumes or rapid-fire humorous lines that make her stand out. Though it is wonderful to get to know the prince and to see what he loves about Cinderella, the character of Cinderella is never given the opportunity to learn anything herself, which is a loss.
Still, Cinderella is the glue that holds the play together. It would be so easy in an opera, with its grandiose size and scale, to get caught up in the glamor and grandeur of it all. However, Cinderella never loses her humble origins and because of this, the opera never feels too over the top. At the end, Cinderella stands alone on the stage. She still wears her dress with patches in it and sweeps the floor humbly, though she now wears a tiara. The music accompanies her until the lights finally dim, and you are left with an image of Cinderella, now a queen, but still just as humble as ever.
And there is something beautiful about that image that stays with you long after the clock strikes midnight.

The U.S. has a moral responsibility to aid those suffering in a civil conflict and stop the use of chemical weapons.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
This alleged war crime has re-ignited the national debate over a U.S. intervention in Syria. If either side used chemical weapons, however, it would simply be another nail in the coffin of the case for U.S. intervention. And regardless, Syrian President Bashar      al-Assad is a war criminal, and it is time for the U.S. to step up.
Since the Syrian civil war started 22 months ago, more than 70,000 Syrian civilians have died, 1.2 million have fled the country, two million are internally displaced and four million require humanitarian aid within the nation of more than 20 million people, according to the United Nations. Assad and his army are responsible for the majority of this human suffering and strife.
Assad has repeatedly shown that he is willing to use his bombs and artillery units to annihilate civilian population centers and fire live rounds to disperse peaceful protestors, so there can be no doubt that Assad is criminally massacring his own civilians.
The willingness of Assad to kill his civilians leaves little doubt in the international community that he would use chemical weapons against his own people. It is “widely believed” that Assad has stockpiles of chemical weapons, according to NPR, which are very easy to launch against civilians to inflict enormous casualties. If he actually did, it becomes even more urgent that the U.S. intervenes in Syria.
In light of these factors, the U.S. has not just a political but a moral obligation to intervene in Syria. When dictators infringe upon the inalienable rights of food, shelter, water and freedom from fear, the international community has an obligation to wage a just war to restore those rights for a terrorized citizenry. The U.S., therefore, must intervene in Syria for the simple sake of morality.
The U.S. has the ability to create change in Syria, so a hypothetical war would not be unwinnable. The U.S. military is the largest in the world and was more heavily financed than the next 13 largest militaries combined in 2011, according to The Washington Post. The overwhelming force of the U.S. military would allow the U.S. to deploy the resources necessary to stop the Syrian army by bombing military installations and chemical weapons depositories.
Syria will not become a counterinsurgency mission. Assad has alienated so many of his people through conventional bombings and the alleged use of chemical weapons that they have begun to take up arms against him in a civil war. If the U.S. intervenes in Syria on behalf of the rebels, it would be working with existing rebel forces to push out Assad.
True, the conventional weaponry used by the U.S. is likely to create collateral damage, but the U.S. will come nowhere close to killing the 70,000 civilians that Assad has already killed or the thousands he will likely kill if he uses chemical weapons.
Instead, the U.S. would be able target Assad’s forces to support the rebels in creating regime change.
The Syrian rebels would be ready to create new leadership after overthrowing Assad. Rebels have already held provincial elections to decide the new leadership of some of the rebel-held provinces, and the rebels include government activists ready to work for stable democracy from Damascus, according to NPR.
Compared to Iraq and Afghanistan, where there was little organized opposition ready to rule, Syria is much closer to creating a democracy that would lead the country to a stable future.
True, the U.S. will likely need to be involved in helping to foster the fledgling government, but that investment would help create stability in the volatile Middle East and enhance the U.S. image in the Muslim world.
It’s time for the United States to step up and help right an international wrong.
Dan Morgan-Russell is a freshman majoring in international relations.
 
As the death toll in the Syrian civil war nears 70,000 lives and new allegations about the use of chemical weapons by both sides of the conflict emerge, the U.S. finds itself ever closer to making a decision to intervene.
But U.S. military intervention, despite the allegations about chemical weapons, would be neither a productive nor feasible form of engagement with Syria. To avoid a repeat of the Iraq debacle and a standoff with Russia, the U.S. and international community should support continued diplomacy and engagement instead of intervening on the rebels’ behalf.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
With no end in sight to the Syrian civil war, Admiral James Stavridis, head of U.S. European Command, indicated at a U.S. Senate hearing that U.S. and NATO talks have not yet ruled out the possibility of providing lethal support to the anti-government militias or using military capabilities to enforce no-fly zones and impose arms embargoes against the Assad regime. The United States has also signaled its support of British and French efforts to act in arming the anti-government militias.
But military intervention would repeat the mistakes of two of the United States’ most misguided wars: Korea and Iraq. Ongoing arms sales from Russia to the Syrian government mean that U.S. action to aid the rebels’ military would be perceived by Russia as a direct threat to diplomacy. Russia, which draws 10 percent of its global arms sales revenue from the Syrian government, is incredibly sensitive to any U.S. actions that might potentially undermine it in the realms of economic and national security.
The stakes are even higher when one considers that Russia blasted Israel earlier in the year for its bombing of Syrian government outposts near Damascus. Risking a military confrontation and proxy war with Russia in Syria resembles the same foreign policy failures that drew the United States into a proxy war with China on the Korean peninsula.
Little more than 10 years after the United States began a failed and erratic attempt to rebuild Iraq, we should be wary of new calls to police the world. The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq cost nearly $2 trillion, left the United States involved in the process of rebuilding a nation rife with ethnic differences that were never fully understood and embroiled our military in wartime scandals such as Abu Ghraib, which decimated our international credibility. The United States, which also acted alongside our allies in Europe, was left holding the bag, the paycheck and by far the largest military commitment when European support of the war effort rapidly declined. This cannot happen again.
Some would suggest that the alleged use of chemical weapons changes the game. Last week, allegations were traded back and forth asserting that chemical weapons had been introduced into the conflict, prompting Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to say that “an increasingly beleaguered regime, having found its escalation of violence through conventional means inadequate, might be prepared to use CW [chemical weapons] against the Syrian people.”
The use of chemical weapons does not change fundamental arguments against intervention. If anything, it strengthens them. The irony should not be lost on the fact that Ake Sellstrom, the Swedish scientist appointed by Ban Ki-moon to investigate the allegations of the deployment of chemical weapons, also once headed the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
Following a 2002 investigation, the Sellstrom-led UNMOVIC concluded that no evidence existed to corroborate the Bush administration’s claim that Iraq had resumed producing weapons of mass destruction prior to the U.S.-led invasion in March of 2003. Intervening in any capacity before the investigation is allowed to run its course would be the height of folly.
Though the use of chemical weapons on the Syrian rebels, if verified, represents a great atrocity that the United States should take diplomatic and economic action against, military involvement should be avoided until such weapons demonstrate a threat to the national security of the United States or our allies. If the United States responded to every foreign scuffle with military action, we would find our military overstretched from Darfur to Myanmar to Uganda.
Compared to military action, the cost of diplomacy and concerted engagement are minimal, but their benefits are equally important.

lol Dan, “The United States should get out of Afghanistan” followed by “The United States should intervene in Syria” 
you’re required to take a firm stance every time to keep your job, right? cuz sometimes your series seem to be not only inconsistent, but irrational…
Anyhow your argument makes it seem like the Syrian ‘Revolution’ is essentially the French Revolution. In fact, I remember another eloquent redhead counseled we intervene there, too… And hot damn thank goodness we did not. For not only are the costs of intervention in any intervention not directly tied to the national interest immeasurably high, as we have discovered time and time again in Haiti, the Philippines, Vietnam, Haiti, Somalia, Yugoslavia, Haiti, not to mention Iraq and Afghanistan, but oftentimes things are never quite what we would like them to appear to be, and the world really is more interesting than it seems. I might note the intense ethnic and sectarian divisions within the Syrian state, and so I just did. It seems to me that Syria is not France, nor is this world one of black and white right and wrong. Though it may be good for you to do what is good simply because it is good, it does not seem prudent for America to do what is good, because what is good may actually not be what is right.
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be discredited and if we do nothing Mali will simply become the next Sudan thanks to Islam’s inherent violent and sadistic tendencies.
