In an interview with film and TV website “The Playlist” about her new film, “Tár,” Cate Blanchett said she thinks the film is “about many things, but it is a meditation on the corruptive nature of power,” echoing the speech she delivered at a Q&A screening at AMC Century City Friday night.
At its core, “Tár” is a deep-seated character study about power and what happens when we let it take control of us. Lydia Tár, the fictional esteemed composer/conductor the film revolves around, is a character who serves herself, conducting the people in her life as if they are musicians in her orchestra.
And none of it would have been possible without the true centerpiece of the film, Blanchett, who delivers arguably the most ferocious performance of her career, the type that comes once every few years. Director Todd Field’s deft direction, combined with Blanchett’s measured restraint, mold her performance into something truly awe-inspiring and for the ages.
A character of such caliber can easily be taken over the top, but Blanchett lends her a remarkably realist nuance that makes her towering sense of self all the more believable. Viewers are led to really trust in this woman’s egoistic perception of herself, thanks to Blanchett’s masterfully articulated performance.
Every interaction with Tár is  bound with tension, almost as if she were unintentionally reminding you of her power and unbridled superiority that makes her both dangerous and wholly fallible to weaknesses. She is never painted as a messianic prodigy figure, but as someone ambitious enough to grow their talents to such heights. She allows herself to take and take because she believes she has already created so much for the world — and she convinces you of this as well, with the help of Field’s script and direction. Even when you don’t agree with something she says, the film constantly reminds you of her greatness, momentarily destabilizing your qualms. She sees herself as the protagonist, a heroic conductor to the cacophonic orchestra that is her world, but what makes her so captivating is that is exactly how we are led to see her as well.
Viewers find out information through Tár’s perspective. We’re on her side through each and every blindside. Her hubris is never so obvious and comes off in how you see her from off-handed remarks to the pantomime of her baton. In a sense, Tár is a character incredibly understated in her bigness, a contradiction that would be difficult for any actor to pull off but one that Blanchett plays to gainly aplomb. 
Through Field’s careful direction, it is clear he takes no interest in making Tár the victim or martyr of her deeds. The point of her morality is unimportant entirely, as Field is less interested in why Tár is motivated to make the decisions that eventually lead to her downfall than how power has manifested itself in her downfall. 
We see her fall from grace play out step by step, but her motives are murky because we have been subject to her subtly filtered view of these events, making the moments of her condescension and ego break through even more effectively. 
This is Field’s first film in 16 years — his last being “Little Children” in 2006 — and it’s truly a testament to his almost scientific attention to detail that makes it so we are able to feel so removed from Tár’s actions whilst simultaneously maintaining an intimacy between viewers and her macro sense of self that lends her a moral ambiguity, which highlight  “Tár’s” ultimate themes of power and corruption.  Watching Tár dig her hole is like watching a car crash in slow motion. Neither you nor the driver can control the outcome of what happens or knows when the impact will hit; it’s stuck, almost entirely left to fate, matching the cruel, Shakespearean irony of Tár’s own descent after being the conductor of her own fate for so long.
Though it feels like a cascade of dominoes when it starts to take shape, Field makes the beginning of this fall from grace feel sudden and abrupt, almost as if the audience is  too late to even catch when and where it begins. However, when it does start, it does not stop until the final frame, and even then you can argue that it continues on. 
But it is Field’s masterful assembly of the film’s many moving parts, all used to brew tension and allow the film to crescendo in a finale that feels earned, that allows the ending to work so well. From the cold cinematography to the tempestuous editing that reflects Tár’s go-go-go mentality to Hildur Guðnadóttir’s gargantuan score that ravishly comes and goes through diegetic orchestral interludes that accentuate Tár’s command as if to reaffirm her sense of power despite the rising challenges to it, there’s a shared tension that takes the seeming monotony of the first and second acts and converts them into a gloriously cinematic downfall.
At the Q&A session, Blanchett said what lured her to the project was how it was a story that is essentially about the universal theme of time. Blanchett feels that as more time passes, we feel more inclined to prove ourselves, thrusting us into a state of trying to do as much and as quickly as possible to consolidate our legacy. She feels that it is a notion that spans industries and careers, and something she herself relates to as an actor moving into the latter stages of her career. If that sentiment was even partly responsible for the sheer magnitude of her work here, I say let the music of Lydia Tár play on.

As we approach Halloween, why not mark your calendars for a whole month of horror? Don’t waste your time on boring, clichéd movies that follow the same formula. Instead, immerse yourself in a jumble of unexpected twists and turns that’ll leave you thinking more deeply than ever. 
“The Wailing” (2016)
An intersection of police investigation, Eastern exorcism and shamanism, “The Wailing” is a seamless cinematographic masterpiece encapsulating a suspenseful horror. “The Wailing” is interpreted into two different meanings in Korean — one actually citing the painful wailings of the dead and another signifying a village where the dreadful horrors unfold. Originally promoted as a clichéd investigative mystery, “The Wailing” terrified audiences with its berserking twist into ghosts and gore. This movie is a “wailing” recommendation if you’re ready to be chilled one October evening. 
“Us” (2019)
What about a horror movie full of easter eggs? A little appetizer before stuffing your face with candy on Halloween night. “Us” incites a thoughtful reflection on society’s privileges and deficits. Jordan Peele’s comeback after his iconic directorial debut “Get Out” (2017),  this film dwindles on the edge of dystopia. Unlike any old horror movie you can quickly shake off the next day, this film will definitely leave you questioning just how the eerie plot came to be. Without any spoilers, this film is a thinker…
“It” (2017)
Maybe the scariest horror movies have the shortest titles? Pennywise, a demonic clown monster, preys on children’s fears, manifesting every child’s unique nightmare. I mean, weren’t we all scared of clowns at some point of our lives? With his iconic tap dancing and shapeshifting abilities, Pennywise distorts the line between reality and nightmare to provoke your worst terrors. 
“Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum” (2018)
Tired of professional quality but evidently fabricated cinematic effects? In “Gonjiam,” the audience follows a young, ambitious group on their journey into an abandoned asylum, rumored to be haunted after two high school boys go missing. Don’t let the authenticity of the camera angles and acting fool you into thinking it’s a cheesy YouTube video, the actors actually filmed everything with body cameras and self-cameras as they walk into the depths of the pitch-black asylum. Seeking juicy clickbait for his horror YouTube channel, the leader of the group, played by “Squid Game” star Ha-Joon Wi, livestreams the group’s escapade that does not end on such a victorious note. I won’t say much more, so I won’t spoil anything, but I will say this: it’s not your everyday Korean horror.
 “The Medium” (2021)
Still craving some creepy spirits and paranormal activity? “The Medium” is a mockumentary set in Thailand, focused on shamas, the medium connecting the real world and lost spirits. Adapted from an original story by Na Hong-jin, the director of “The Wailing,” this Thai-South Korean supernatural horror is a deeper dive into the creepy cinematics of shamanism. If you’re down to use your imagination, “The Medium” leaves room for ambiguity, leading the audience to think about the ancestral consequences of karma and ritualistic beliefs.
“Orphan” (2009)
What about a story about a regular family who adopts a seemingly young, sweet girl? This psychological horror revolves around 9 year-old Esther, a nice girl from Russia, but it is discovered that she is not so much a little girl, or even a child. No, she isn’t, and still the worst is yet to come. This film is loosely based on real events that shocked the world with its utmost atrocity. If you want to dive into something incredibly appalling and left in disbelief for the sake of it, “Orphan” is your show.  We all know the worst terrors are the ones that come at us in the most realistic way.
“Midsommar” (2019)
Looking for a twist? “Midsommar” breaks all horror clichés with its beautiful scenes filmed in broad daylight. Ever seen something so uncanny and peaceful, it’s eerie? “Midsommar” does exactly that. If you’re tired of dimly lit scenes reigning supreme in the world of horror, tune into this psychological horror that serenades a Swedish midsummer festival. The calmly silent faces will lure you in with their smiles as they distort into a distant wailing of emancipation. Director Ari Aster portrays an unnerving eternal daylight that is midsommar through an unsteady relationship of a couple on the brink of a breakup.

A mutation in a newly discovered microprotein might lead to a significant risk for Alzheimer’s disease, according to research from the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. The discovery expanded the gene target to treat the disease and provided a new potential therapeutic solution to the incurable disease. 
The newly-discovered protein, named SHMOOSE, is encoded by a gene that exists within the cell’s mitochondria, which is responsible for cell’s energy production. A mutation within this gene, which partially inactivates the SHMOOSE microprotein, is associated with a 30% increase in one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The mutated version of the protein has reportedly appeared within nearly a quarter of people of European ancestry.
Brendan Miller, a 2022 doctoral graduate who studied neuroscience and the study’s first author, relied on big data techniques to identify genetic variations associated with disease risk, after analyses revealed that mutations are linked to increased risk of Alzheimer’s, brain atrophy and energy metabolism. 
Researchers began studying the gene’s mutated and default forms and found that SHMOOSE is the first mitochondrial-DNA-encoded microprotein to be detected using both antibodies and mass spectrometry.
Miller said one of the biggest obstacles in the research process was the sheer amount of data that researchers had to compile to make these findings. Miller described this “big data” as taking up “terabytes” of storage, containing research gleaned from dozens of individuals. His team was able to overcome this by utilizing new and advanced technology, which allowed them to make discoveries not otherwise possible. 
“Computational power over the last ten years has grown exponentially. With that means you’re going to see in the field of medicine and biology a lot of rapid discoveries,” Miller said. “At USC, we have infrastructure, and we have a lot of talented computational scientists to help us with that.”
Being able to manipulate and understand big data was essential for the success of this project, Miller said. 
“The big challenge is starting from hundreds of potential gene targets and narrowing them down to one,” Miller said. “The way we did this was [by] implementing a lot of genetics data and omics data from similar individuals with different data types.”
The study highlights the importance of the emerging field of microprotein studies. Microprotein, a small protein encoded from a small open reading frame, appears to modify energy signaling and metabolism in the central nervous system. A variety of studies have found microproteins in mitochondria of neurons and showed that SHMOOSE alters energy metabolism in the brain, in part by inhibiting the inner mitochondrial membrane.
“When you look at microproteins, there are many hundreds of thousands of them, [which] creates a whole new dimension of things that need to be discovered,” said Pinchas Cohen, a professor of gerontology, medicine and biological sciences and the senior author of the study. 
There is currently no approved medicine for Alzheimer’s disease developed based on microproteins, while microprotein- or peptide-related treatments have been employed in treatments of diabetes, heart diseases and some other chronic illnesses. The therapeutic potential of microproteins in Alzheimer’s cases was thus exciting news for many researchers in the field.
Helena Chang Chui, chair and professor of neurology at Keck School of Medicine, said the paper is “very rich” and has significant potential impact for understanding the causes of Alzheimer’s.
“We’re getting a little bit closer with immunological approaches with monoclonal antibodies…[and] antibodies against amyloid proteins, but there’s been no particular no peptide treatments,” Chui said.
Researchers are, on the whole, cautiously optimistic about the therapeutic potential of the study, Cohen said, and it is still too early to contemplate applying the findings of the study into therapeutic research. Cohen said he hopes that the team could use standard mouse models of Alzheimer’s and demonstrate that SHMOOSE does have benefits on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Then, as Cohen implied, the team might pick individuals who have the SHMOOSE mutation to do the research, which will lend to the precision medicine approaches.
“The issue is that Alzhmeimer’s disease is very heterogeneous. [It’s] not really one specific condition, it’s multiple conditions, each being a result of various genetic susceptibilities, that all present in a similar way,” Cohen said. “That’s why I believe that treatments that will be focused on the primary genetic abnormality, also known as precision medicine approaches, will be more efficacious.”

With “DAHMER – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” Netflix’s newest serial killer series, taking the number one spot on the top ten Netflix shows in the United States, I’m at a loss for words. Despite the immense media saturation and endless selection of shows to watch, the public still opts to give their attention to the 900th series about [insert serial killer name]’s crimes. It’s troubling to see not only a huge surge in this genre of media, but also the inadvertent desensitization to such violent crimes that has yet to be earnestly addressed.
It’s understandable to have a natural curiosity to learn the grisly details about heinous crimes that we could never commit ourselves, but where do we draw the line? Consuming media that allows us to peek behind the curtain from the safety of our homes is a luxury that is fairly new to us, but precisely for this reason, we need to establish what becomes, well, overkill, in this genre.
For the sake of making my point, let’s stick with the example of Dahmer. Since 1992, there have been 12 Batman projects released — a well-loved superhero series, so the numbers more or less make sense, right? So, how do we explain the need for the 20 projects about Dahmer’s story that were released in the same amount of time? Not to mention that this doesn’t even take into consideration the countless other TV and film series about other well-known serial killers. Unlike the fiction that is Batman, Dahmer’s is that of reality — 17 men murdered and 17 families that continue to be affected by his actions. 
Not to blame consumers or anything, but I wholeheartedly blame consumers. The entertainment industry wouldn’t invest potentially millions of dollars into a series or movie if they didn’t think it would be profitable; true crime has become a consistent weakness for consumers everywhere as the industry has been able to count on guaranteed millions of views on their sensationalized projects.
Disturbingly enough, the people within the entertainment industry aren’t the only ones cashing in, as the true crime retail market has exploded with all kinds of absurd products. Online shop owner @sayitwithgracedesigns posted a video on TikTok of her handmade T-shirts with the text “Choke me like Bundy and eat me like Dahmer” emblazoned on the front — I didn’t think it could get worse until I opened the comment section to find users saying they “needed [the T-shirt]” and inquiring if there was a hoodie option.
Even though many of us are aware of how low some are willing to go to turn a profit, one of the most heartbreaking problems with the true crime industry is how they blatantly neglect the retraumatization the victims’ families have to go through when the experience is shared in the media.
Dealing with the loss of a loved one is difficult as is, and being forced to mourn with the public watching you must feel like a nightmare you can’t wake up from — precisely what the family of slain Robert Mast, victim of Lindsay Haugen, explained in their interview with TIME. Even if you had the time to grieve and process the trauma, it all becomes exponentially worse when you find that your son’s murderer has been made into a celebrity. Where is the justice in that?
After Netflix reached out to Mast’s friends and family for participation in their new series “I AM A KILLER,” his mother’s pleading emails to the corporation fell on deaf ears: “As a parent, a fellow human being, I beg you not to do this.”
Production went on as planned and worse yet, the series shamelessly portrayed Mast’s killer in a sympathetic light, cementing the levels of glaring disrespect to the victims’ families which is all too common. True crime is inherently unethical, as the industry’s profit hinges completely on the traumatic experiences of the families and encourages the normalization and inadvertent celebration of the perpetrators of these crimes.
The true crime genre was never about bringing justice to these tragic situations —instead, its purpose has become muddled with capitalism and the sensationalization of the subject accomplishes about as much as gossip does.
With true crime media flooding the market, many times we choose not to think about how these events happened to real people who must now live with that burden. The least we can do as consumers is to exercise tact when coming into contact with this genre — preferably giving victims the opportunity to forget, or more likely, to not be reminded of their experience constantly. Goodness knows that our watchlists will recover and remain just as long as ever — even in the absence of true crime anyway.

I love ice cream. As I’m writing this opinion column, I’m eating some Ben & Jerry’s — I chose Stephen Colbert’s Americone Dream from Target this week. It’s not anything to write home about — vanilla ice cream with caramel swirls and chocolate-covered waffle cone chunks is a strong combination, but lacks an exciting ingredient; it lacks the “It” factor. 
I have my favorites: Cherry Garcia (It factor: using cherry ice cream instead of vanilla) and Half Baked (It factor: cookie dough) are up there currently, but I like to mix it up. I wouldn’t want to grow tired of the top dogs. I have to have my Stephen Colberts to appreciate my Cherry Garcias. 
I experienced this truism at an early age. There was an ice cream store near my house called The Ice Cream Show, where, instead of premade flavors like Rocky Road or Chunky Monkey, you selected between chocolate and vanilla ice cream (or a swirl of the two) and had the choice between roughly (and up to) 40 ingredients. This was then mixed together with the ice cream in an industrial blender producing a soft serve ice cream with smashed bits of whatever combination of ingredients scattered throughout the entirety of the product. Phew. 
That was a mouthful, but context is important. 
I would always get vanilla ice cream with Whoppers and gummy worms on top. Every time. If you do the math, with the 33-33-33 split between chocolate or vanilla or swirl, throw a quick 40 factorial in the mix to consider the variety of ingredients, there are thousands of different combinations at The Ice Cream Show. I stuck with just one, and my vanilla with Whoppers and gummy worms on a waffle cone stayed in my repertoire for years. As they say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
However, as I finished my senior year of high school and prepared to head out to Southern California, something changed. No longer was I in front of the counter ordering a combination that had become ingrained in my Ice Cream Show routine. I was now behind the counter, earning a crisp $8 an hour, taking and making others’ orders. 
I heard a lot of interesting combinations in my time behind the register. Some of them sounded good, like peanut butter and strawberry in vanilla ice cream or green mint, Oreos and marshmallow in chocolate. Others, not so much (mango and pistachio in vanilla or blueberry and peppermint in chocolate). 
On slow days, I had free reign over the vast selection of ingredients and could experiment with different combinations — I began to fix what wasn’t broken. 
Cheesecake quickly became a favorite ingredient of mine. One day, I would combine it with blueberries and graham crackers, the next Butterfingers and peanut butter. My favorite combination soon became Oreo, strawberry and cheesecake — in vanilla ice cream, of course. 
I feel strongly for vanilla ice cream, the blank slate of ice cream flavors in which even ingredients as subtle as pineapple or coconut could make their presence felt. Chocolate was too overpowering and didn’t play a good host to some ingredients. 
Last summer, as I prepared to enter my senior year of college, I returned to The Ice Cream Show and, once more, stepped behind the counter. 
I was in more of a managerial position than I was a few years before — although it was never an official title. I was leading a ragtag group of high schoolers and certainly felt that if I didn’t step into that position things could quickly go wrong. 
Because of this, I was on the machine making ice creams more than I had been during my first year at the Show. It was rare that I would spend time at the register. On some shifts, when we were slammed, I would make ice cream for three or four hours straight — which is more work than it might sound like. 
At the end of my shift, when I would typically prepare a combination to take home and try, I was too tired. I had spent so much time making others’ creations that I had no desire to craft my own. I was overexposed to the delicious treat and couldn’t appreciate it the way I had before. 
But now, as I sit eating some average at best Ben & Jerry’s, I appreciate The Ice Cream Show more than I did over this summer, when I was too busy putting on a smile for customers and making sure my co-workers were co-working. Having access to the amalgamation of fruits, candies, nuts and miscellaneous items was a blessing. Getting free ice cream daily was a blessing. Making $8 an hour was not as much of a blessing, but it was the icing on top, I suppose. 
They say you don’t really appreciate what you have until it’s gone, and I think that is true, in a sense. You can, of course, appreciate things while they’re sitting in front of you, but that level of appreciation is amplified when that something is taken away. 
We’re about six weeks into the semester, and I’m feeling pretty burnt out. The days have been chock-full of classes, Daily Trojan production and general life management — which is becoming more and more of a full time job. There have been times where I’ve been overwhelmed and have wanted to quit and run away to Alaska and live with bears, catching salmon with my mouth and getting my hand stuck in a jar of honey. 
But I know that in a year or two, I’ll be eating some Americone Dream in some city working some job, and recall these days and long to go back to the register, to the classroom, to the newsroom. So, for now, Alaska can wait. I’m pretty sure the ice cream scene isn’t anything special up there anyways. 
“Editors’ Epilogue” is a rotating column featuring a new Daily Trojan editor in each installment and their personal experiences of living in what seems to be an irrepressible dumpster fire of a world.

The sounds of the Trojan Marching Band resonated throughout Alumni Park Thursday,  signifying the beginning of Trojan Family Weekend 2022. The four-day-long event gave families the opportunity to attend over 200 varying lectures, workshops and tours, a Trojan Family Weekend Tailgate, an “A Flock of Seagulls” concert and more. 
The annual celebration gives families the inside scoop into life at USC — however, some family members may already be acquainted with the life of a Trojan. For USC alumni, Trojan Family Weekend offers a chance to relive the past while comparing their experiences with their children’s. 
“[USC has] changed a lot,” said alumna Leah Solter, who graduated from the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1998. “But the basic feeling of campus is the same.”
Leah’s daughter, Jordyn Solter, decided to follow in her family’s footsteps and attend the same school as her mother, which became known as the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 2011. 
“I was very excited [to hear Jordyn got accepted], and I think [she] would say I definitely tried to nudge her in the direction [of USC],” Leah said. 
Jordyn, a freshman majoring in psychology, believes that Trojan Family Weekend couldn’t have come at a better time. 
“[Trojan Family Weekend] comes at a perfect time because I think it’s a time [when] a lot of people may start feeling homesick or missing their parents or siblings,” Jordyn said. 
Students weren’t the only ones delighted to see their families, though — Leah noted the excitement she had at visiting her daughter at her alma mater. 
“I’m looking forward to [being] on campus, [being] at a game and [being] a part of the whole community again,” Leah said. 
Before kicking off the game against the Washington State Cougars, USC hosted a Trojan Family Tailgate within Alumni Park, which boasted an assortment of photo booths, games, activities, food and drinks. 
Alongside the Trojan Family Tailgate, numerous other specifically catered tailgates existed for families to attend. The Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, the USC Caruso Catholic Center and the Thornton School of Music’s Music Industry Department each held their own events, offering families a place to connect with the people their children may have met through their new student communities at USC.
For the Solter family, attending various tailgates before the football game allowed Leah and Jordyn to bond over shared experiences and make memories together.
“I know when my mom went here, she really enjoyed the tailgates,” Jordyn said. “I’m excited to experience those with her, as I think they’ve changed a lot from when she was here.” 
Each Trojan lives a unique life at USC — while some choose to emphasize the gameday lifestyle, some dedicate their time more strictly to their studies. Alumna Marie Clemente graduated from the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work in 1996 and looked forward to getting a new perspective of campus at the Family Weekend tailgates — one from the eyes of an observer rather than a doer. 
“I really didn’t have the chance to know the culture of the school that well [when I attended USC], it was mostly professional,” Clemente said. 
Clemente noted the connections she was able to make through her time at USC, a school often acknowledged for their strong and broad alumni network. According to College Consensus, USC has “one of the best alumni networks in the nation.” Leah Solter recounts getting frequent messages from the USC Alumni Association over the years.
“I feel like in the last 24 years, since I graduated, [USC has kept] in constant communication,” Leah said. “[The Alumni Association reaches] out, they send a lot of information [and] they always want to include the alumni.” 
The Alumni Association has over 35,500 followers on Facebook, and is used to spread information regarding current USC and alumni events.
Both Jordyn and Leah Solter agreed that even before Jordyn had even applied to USC, the support from alumni was significant. 
“I feel like all the alumni want to help all the current students or future students, just because the [USC community] is so great,” Leah said. 
Leah acknowledges one of the reasons behind their family’s three generations of attendance at USC — including during Trojan Family Weekend — was the deep commitment of the alumni. 
“I think the alumni always want to be a part of everything that’s going on with USC,” Leah said.

If you’ve been keeping up with this column, you know that I usually use my intros for long-winded descriptions of something that is only tangentially related to the column’s actual topic. And, while I love to have what effectively boils down to a soliloquy about my failing grades, this time it’s different. 
I am writing this column on Thursday, Oct. 6. And today, for better or for worse, the world got its first glimpse of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (2023). 
While I am sure some dedicated fans were brimming with excitement for the movie trailer, most of the internet already wrote it off as a huge flaming disaster since the main cast was announced.
But I am getting ahead of myself. For those of you who don’t know, back in 2018, Nintendo announced a partnership with animation studio Illumination, famous for the “Despicable Me” series. This, while unexpected, wasn’t necessarily a surprise. Nintendo has been venturing into other forms of entertainment for a while now. I even wrote a column about another Nintendo collaboration with Universal Studios, a park called “Super Nintendo World,” back in 2021. With a company as family-friendly and famous as Nintendo , it makes sense for them to eventually break into the film industry. 
Problem is, that decision doesn’t come in a vacuum. Video game movie adaptations have been notoriously bad, and that expectation hung around every new announcement for “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” However, the biggest blow to whatever hype this movie could’ve gotten wasn’t even born from its historical context. No, most of the internet blames it on one sole factor: the cast.
Much like many other Hollywood animated movies, the cast is filled with A-list actors. However, since the characters in the game already have pretty recognizable voices, many fans were hesitant, if not outright disappointed, when casting choices were announced, worried they may not do the characters justice. Still, many cast members actually have experience in either voice acting or humor, and even those with a particularly unique voice (i.e. Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong) offered a possible funny twist on the character. So, in that sense, the internet was divided on what could come from “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” with half expecting a dumpster fire, and another expecting a lesser, perhaps even more entertaining dumpster fire. 
However, if there is one thing everyone seems to have in common, it is their absolute distaste, confusion and genuine astonishment at the movie’s crown jewel: Chris Pratt as Mario. 
Yes, yes, I know, Chris Pratt technically has experience in voice acting, but most of the internet seemed to agree that his work as Emmett in “The Lego Movie” (2014)  was less voice acting and more…his normal voice? Add that to the fact that Mario’s usual voice actor, Charles Martinet, has crafted such a unique and easily recognizable voice for the character, and you can start to understand why the internet was so vehemently against the casting.
So, adding all of these elements together, many felt that  “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” was, effectively, a perfect storm for the gaming community. Still, without a trailer, the movie became sort of a Schrodinger’s Cat; it was at the same time horrible and great. 
This sort of nuance came crashing down today (or last Thursday for all of you) when Nintendo finally released a teaser for the movie. And I have to say, it…wasn’t as bad as I expected?
To be fair, Nintendo knew what they were doing, focusing the teaser on Jack Black’s performance as Bowser, which virtually no one was against from the start. Still, there were some pleasant surprises. The jokes, originally expected to be corny, weren’t that bad. And even Keegan-Michael Key’s performance as Toad was true to the character. 
Sadly, it seems like the internet’s expectations about Chris Pratt proved to be correct. In the total 35 seconds that he appeared in the trailer, anyone could tell that his “Mario voice” was just his regular voice. But contrary to the disaster everyone was expecting, the teaser ended up getting more people excited for the movie. And if it turns out to genuinely be a fun experience, this could have severe consequences in the industry.
Having a video game company like Nintendo succeed in bridging into movies sets up a precedent. The conversation before the teaser revealed that Nintendo and Illumination began talks on this movie seven years ago. This proves that this isn’t a project born out of desperation, but rather careful planning on both sides. 
Thanks to Nintendo’s careful process, this venture has taken the proportions of a blockbuster. And unlike other studios, who make rushed movies simply because their video games have been described as “cinematic” (cough cough Sony and Naughty Dog with “Uncharted” (2022)), Nintendo understands that making films is a completely different thing than making video games. So, by working together, both companies have managed to create something unique that appeals to both newcomers and hardcore fans alike. This might change if the movie turns out to be a complete mess, but as of right now, I’m looking forward to seeing it in April 2023. Just…don’t expect me to ever warm up to Chris Pratt. If I have to hear him saying “here we go” or any other sort of catchphrase, I might genuinely need an extra life.
