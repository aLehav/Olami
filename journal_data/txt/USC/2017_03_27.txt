Katie Chin | Daily TrojanFlying high · Freshman Avery Hazelrigg and the Trojans are undefeated as the top team in the country. They will look to continue their dominance on Tuesday when No. 14 Cal visits Merle Norman Stadium.
With the No. 1 USC beach volleyball team back on the West Coast after a weekend-long trip to South Carolina, the undefeated Trojans (16-0) will now square off against a Pac-12 foe in the No. 14 California Golden Bears for a dual match Tuesday at Merle Norman Stadium.
The Trojans will be playing on little rest after returning from their cross-country trip to Columbia, S.C. over the weekend when they took part in the Gamecock Grand
Slam-Dan Apol Memorial tournament. There, the Trojans pulled out four wins against four ranked teams in No. 4 Florida State, No. 9 host South Carolina, No. 9 Georgia State and No. 13 Stetson at Wheeler Beach to remain undefeated on the season and push their winning streak to 46 consecutive dual matches. 
USC is led by senior
All-Americans Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes at the top court, and the pair ran their own winning streak to a remarkable 91 matches in a row dating back to the 2015 season with their wins over the weekend. The No. 2 and No. 3 pairs for the Trojans are also made up of upperclassmen, as seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler went 3-1 at the two spot, and junior Terese Cannon and senior Nicolette Martin went a perfect 4-0 at court three. USC’s young guns in sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis went 3-1 on the weekend at court four, while the reigning Pac-12 Pair of the Week, juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer, kept their hot streak going with four wins to improve to 14-1 on the season. Belton and Kremer also made history as the first-ever No. 5 pair to win the conference’s weekly award.
Cal, the Trojans’ next opponent, was on an eight-match winning streak of its own before being downed by St. Mary’s College last Friday, 3-2. The Golden Bears are currently 5-2 on the road this season and will look to pull the upset at Merle Norman Stadium on Tuesday, but history is not on their side as Cal has never defeated USC in dual play.
In fact, the Trojans posted a pair of sweeps in the programs’ last two meetings. The last dual match between USC and Cal took place in the second round of the inaugural
Pac-12 Championships last April, which was also hosted at Merle Norman Stadium. There, the Trojans were the top seed, while the Golden Bears were seeded fourth. USC came away with the 5-0 win, advancing to the tournament semifinals and eventually capturing the
first-ever Pac-12 Team Championship.
Nearly a year later, USC will look for more of that same success on Tuesday. As the players gear up to play their fifth dual in four days, Kremer believes that the team will simply need to push through its fatigue and focus on the task at hand.
“I think the most important thing for us is going to be keeping a high level of focus,” Kremer said. “We’re going to be a bit tired after traveling, so we just need to have that mental toughness in order to really push through and play our game. If we can do that, we’ll be fine.”
The match against Cal will begin at approximately 4 p.m., followed immediately after by the pairs tournament at 6 p.m. PST. The dual will also be broadcast on Pac-12 Network.

During a trip to the East Coast, the No. 9 women’s lacrosse team split games against No. 7 Stony Brook and Ohio State. The Trojans fell to Stony Brook on Friday before rebounding with a win against the Buckeyes on Sunday to bring their record to 7-3 overall. 
Struggling to turn offensive opportunities into goals on Friday, USC fell 9-7 to the Seawolves. Stony Brook came out strong in the first half, jumping out to a 3-0 lead. Though senior attacker Kylie Drexel managed to pull one back and get USC on the board, the Seawolves responded with two goals of their own to make the score 5-1. Unrelenting, they quickly extended their lead to 7-2, with back-to-back goals from Kylie Ohlmiller handing the Trojans a large deficit to combat. 
In the second half, the Trojans gained some momentum, closing the gap to three to make the score 9-6. However, with just five minutes left to play, Stony Brook’s defense halted the Trojans’ comeback. Overall, the Seawolves outshot the Trojans 22-19, giving Stony Brook the necessary edge to secure a victory. 
Drexel had one of her best career performances against Stony Brook, finishing the night with two goals and one assist in addition to two ground balls and a career-high five caused turnovers. Senior attacker Michaela Michael also showcased her prowess with two goals and six draw controls. 
However, Stony Brook goalie Anna Tesoriero was a force to be reckoned with in goal and successfully thwarted nine USC attempts on goal while picking up three ground balls. 
After the team’s second straight loss, USC rebounded to earn its seventh win of the season against Ohio State in the program’s first-ever matchup against the Buckeyes. In Sunday’s contest, the Trojans came out victorious in front of a crowd of over 2,000 spectators, defeating Ohio State 16-7 at Mountain Lakes High School in Mountain Lakes, N.J. — the alma mater of fifth-year USC head coach Lindsey Munday.
 In the victory, Michael played an instrumental role, notching six goals for the third time in her career. Two other Trojans also recorded hat tricks in the game, including Drexel and senior attacker Gabby McMahon. Drexel also led USC in draw controls, securing three in addition to one assist. USC demonstrated the depth of its offense, with goals from four other Trojans, including senior attacker Cynthia Del Core, senior midfielder Drew Jackson, freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller and freshman Kaeli Huff. 
On defense, the Trojans were anchored by senior Nina Kelty and junior Lydia Sutton, who scooped up three ground balls each along with three caused turnovers from Sutton. Junior Gussie Johns turned in a strong performance in goal with six ground balls, two caused turnovers and three saves to halt the Buckeye offense and earn the Trojans the win. 
Next up for the Trojans are two home games this week. USC will face Fresno State on Friday before taking on Cal on Sunday at McAlister Field.

The baseball team has done well in Pac-12 play.
The Trojans (14-8) have won both of their conference series so far against Washington State and Arizona State — each series with two wins and one loss. Now they get a break from the Pac-12, playing San Diego State (16-8) for a second time. 
The Aztecs look to be a formidable opponent. Junior outfielder Tyler Adkison’s .537 average is the highest in Division I (The Trojans avoided Adkison’s bat last time around by walking him three times). The team has a batting average of .313, which ranks 23rd nationally. 
This past week, San Diego State boasted both Mountain West players of the week: Adkison and senior pitcher Brett Seeburger. Earlier this season, the Aztecs beat No. 10 Cal State Fullerton 5-4. The Trojans will play Fullerton later on in mid-April. 
The Trojans played San Diego State previously on March 7. It was a close game, but the Trojans pulled out a 1-0 victory behind a strong bullpen effort and a run-scoring single from sophomore infielder Brandon Perez in the seventh inning. It was USC’s second shutout of the season. 
Freshman pitcher Austin Manning had a good outing against the Aztecs last time around, tossing two hitless innings and closing out the game. He earned his second save of the season, and redshirt sophomore Bryce Dyrda got the win. That game was also sophomore CJ Stubbs’ first start of the season on the mound. Perez now leads the team with a .338 batting average, while sophomore outfielder Lars Nootbaar leads the team with a .543 slugging percentage and a .475 on base percentage.
“[Redshirt junior] Frankie Rios and Lars are obviously having a great start to the season,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We need [junior third baseman] Alberto Carrillo to continue to get better and better. And Brandon Perez. The guys that you’ve invested time in and have performed in the conference need to be able to perform in these games. That alleviates some pressure on other guys that maybe are trying to do too much when the offense isn’t flowing as well as we’d like it to.” 
Stubbs could start Tuesday’s game against San Diego State, though the fourth slot in the Trojan starting rotation has been a bit of a revolving door. The season started with junior Mason Perryman, but Stubbs has taken over the role since his return against San Diego State. 
When the Trojans have been given off days, they have also chosen to bypass the fourth starter and begin again with now-No.1 starter, freshman Chris Clarke. Clarke is replacing the injured junior starter Mitch Hart, whose season ended after suffering a shoulder injury against San Diego on March 3. He has undergone surgery and will be back in time for the 2018 season. 
USC has been comfortable at home so far this year, going 10-5. The Trojans will look to improve on that record on Tuesday, as first pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

Senior women’s lacrosse attacker Michaela Michael earned the honor of MPSF Offensive Player of the Week for her performance from March 20 to 26. This is the seventh time that Michael has earned the honor for her offensive play and the eighth overall time that the senior was honored with a weekly award from the league. She also earned a rookie honor in 2014.
In her two games last week, Michael netted eight goals while racking up seven draw controls, three ground balls and two caused turnovers. Six of those goals came from her performance against Ohio State, which was her third career game with six or more goals. The Ohio State match also notched the 32nd hat trick of her career, the best in program history.
As a team, the Trojans have now earned 28 different weekly awards from the MPSF. Eleven of those awards were for offensive players, while 10 were given to defenders and seven were awarded to rookie honorees. Throughout this season, the team has received five weekly honors so far.
USC will return home to McAlister Field on Friday after playing four games on the East Coast. The team is ranked No. 9 in the nation after a 7-3 start to their season. As they seek to remain perfect in the MPSF, the Trojans will host Fresno State on Friday, then face off against Cal on Sunday.

Momentum is an awfully powerful thing. It has the ability to take you from a stagnant halt one second to a state of instant acceleration the next. 
Just 15 months ago, there were no NFL teams in Los Angeles or Las Vegas. It’s now March 2017, and the Los Angeles Rams just completed their first season back in the City of Angels, while the Los Angeles Chargers are preparing to play their first season at the snug StubHub Center in Carson. And on Monday afternoon, the Oakland Raiders have announced they will be relocating the franchise to Las Vegas by the 2020 season. 
NFL franchises have experienced a violent rush of momentum in relocating over the past year and a half. Thirty-two league owners gathered on Monday to vote on the Raiders’ proposal for a relocation to Las Vegas. Needing 24 votes to authorize the relocation, the Raiders received a 31-1 vote in favor of the team moving to the Sin City.
This will be the second time the Raiders have departed from the city of Oakland (they left in 1982 for Los Angeles before returning in 1995). While the relocation has been approved, the Raiders will play two more seasons in the Bay Area before making the transition to Las Vegas. 
Issues with acquiring a new stadium in Oakland were one of the main factors which may have led to the Raiders’ relocation. When Oakland wasn’t able to deliver on a new stadium, owner Mark Davis began intensifying relocation efforts. 
When franchise relocation strikes, agony and heartbreak from the fanbase do, too. Raiders quarterback Derek Carr took to Twitter to tend to the many Raider faithful in Oakland who had just received the news that they would be losing their beloved franchise.
“I am overwhelmed with emotion,” Carr said. “I don’t know how we should feel. I feel the pain of our fans in Oakland. I also see the joy on the faces of our new fans in Las Vegas. While I am from California and would have loved playing in Oakland my whole career, I understand the business side of the NFL.” 
The Vegas Strip hosted professional football from the short-lived AFL and XFL in the early 2000s, but the teams faded away into nonexistence. When the Raiders make the trek to Vegas in the coming years, they will add a new dynamic which the city has never possessed — an NFL franchise. 
If you want to talk about momentum, Las Vegas is its epitome in the sports world. One year ago, Las Vegas was home to zero professional sports franchises (no, I’m not counting the Las Vegas 51s, a minor league baseball team). Now Vegas is home to the Golden Knights, an expansion NHL franchise slated to begin competing this next season — and the Raiders, a historically significant NFL franchise, are on the way. 
From my perspective, the Raiders’ move to Las Vegas is a smart one across the board.
One of the long-lasting arguments against installing professional sports in Las Vegas was the hyperactive gambling market in the city. We should find it ironic that the two sports commissioners most adamantly opposed to gambling (NFL commisioner Roger Goodell and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman) were the first two commissioners to settle teams in Las Vegas. While intensified gambling could draw some issues for the teams, I believe Vegas will profit exponentially from the presence of a professional football team. 
Just think about those spiffy bundle deals that you know the casinos and hotels on the Vegas Strip are already conjuring up. The hotels, bars, clubs and lounges will be booming on any weekend during which the Raiders are in town playing on their home turf. For tourists traveling to Vegas to watch their team take on the Raiders, a game weekend will be at least a multiple-day affair which will likely time spent at all the resorts and venues Vegas has to offer. I’d project that the Sin City is set to become the “win city” economically with the relocation of the Raiders. 
Many have also noted that the Raiders will be making a move from Oakland, the No. 6 television market nationally, to Las Vegas, which is the No. 40 TV market. With the boom of social media and big television deals, it could be argued that television markets are not as crucial as they once were. Consider that Oklahoma City (the home of an NBA franchise) has the No. 43 TV market and Green Bay (home of the Packers) owns the No. 68 market. 
Once the Raiders transition to Las Vegas, it will almost instantly become one of the most extravagant sporting cities in the world. Vegas already holds the title of “Fight Capital of the World.” The city already has a blooming NHL franchise in the Golden Knights. The newly built T-Mobile Arena, planted on the Strip, is versatile in the way it can host anything from a UFC event to the Pac-12 Men’s Basketball Tournament. And now we know the city will be adding a Raider team, which, led by a rising star in Carr, could be ready to compete for titles in Vegas. 
They’ll be playing in a new stadium, expected to be ready in Las Vegas by the start of the 2020 NFL season. The Raiders have proposed a 65,000-seat domed stadium that would be shared with UNLV. 
In the meantime, the Raiders are surely still the “Oakland Raiders” at the moment. The Raiders are expected to occupy the Bay Area for at least two more seasons — two more shots to bring a Super Bowl to Oakland for the first time since 1980.
However, in this tough situation, even the most extreme of optimists would admit that a Lombardi Trophy may still not be potent enough to pacify the bad taste being left in the mouths of many after the Raiders’ relocation.

Filmmaker George Lucas has donated another $10 million to the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the University announced Monday. The gift will fund The George Lucas Foundation Endowed Student Support Fund for Diversity, which was established in 2015 to provide financial assistance to African American and Hispanic students.
The present donation follows an initial $10 million donation by the George Lucas Family Foundation in 2015.
Vice Dean of Academic Affairs Michael Renov said Lucas’ donation will benefit the film school years to come. 
“We are grateful that Mellody Hobson and George Lucas continue to provide visionary leadership on issues of diversity in our field,” Renov told USC News. “This endowed fund allows us to recruit storytellers whose voices are underrepresented in cinematic media and whose inclusion benefits all of us.”
In 2015, President C. L. Max Nikias acknowledged Lucas’ gift, citing Lucas as a friend to the USC community.
“This gift will nurture the next generation of artists, supporting scholarships that enhance access in the cinematic arts, while bringing new and diverse voices and stories into our lives,” Nikias told USC News.
Jonathan Curtiss, a graduate student majoring in writing for screen and television at the School of Cinematic Arts, was among the first George Lucas scholars who benefited from the fund. 
“The George Lucas Scholarship really opened the door for me because I wouldn’t have been able to attend USC,” Curtiss told USC News. “Without it, my acceptance letter would have just been decoration in my room. Filmmaking is what I was created to do and this scholarship means I have fellowship, opportunity and the ability to inspire younger filmmakers in my community to dream without limits.”
The School of Cinematic Arts has also recently been supported by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association Endowed International Student Support Fund that supports students with financial need studying at the School of Cinematic Arts on student visas.
Well done Mr. Star Wars!
George, for the record, many white students are in need of financial support every bit as much as non-whites.  Why are they excluded from your generosity?

Twice a month, USC students meet with high school students from the surrounding area to engage in science, technology, engineering, art and math activities. 
These students are part of Project Launch, a semester-long mentorship program that aims to connect USC mentors to inner-city high school mentees. Mentors meet with mentees at least twice a month and help facilitate trips to tech and entrepreneurship hubs in Los Angeles. The mentees are called “rockets” by program leaders to follow with the theme of “launching” into space. 
Seventy-five percent of the rockets are female, and all are people of color. In addition, they are some of the most high-achieving students at their respective high schools. 
Sarah Wagner, an undecided freshman, heard about Project Launch and shared her excitement about this initiative. 
“I think that it is really great that USC students are taking time out of their days to reach out to high school students who might not otherwise have many resources when it comes to STEAM,” Wagner said. “When you inspire a young person, the effects can truly be life-changing, and I’m curious to see what Project Launch is able to accomplish in the years to come.” 
The mission of the program is to prepare mentees to be future leaders. In order to accomplish this goal, Project Launch includes four workshops or “missions” that teach skills that are not emphasized in traditional classroom settings such as coding, video editing, working in teams and drafting professional emails. The combination of these hard and soft skills prepares students to enter the entrepreneurial community along with professions in the STEAM field.
Aditya Aggarwal, the current leader of Project Launch, said he aims to prepare high schoolers for their future careers.
“Through Project Launch, I hope to create an effective program that teaches high school students the value of real-world business skills and creativity,” Aggarwal said. “I noticed when I was in high school that it was pretty hard for people around me and myself to explore things like web development, design in [Adobe] After Effects and Illustrator — not because they were tough to learn, but there was no support structure for it. The focus of school was on doing well in subjects like physics, math and acing standardized testing.” 
Kai MacLean, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, can relate to the importance of seeing women of color in the field of STEAM. 
“As long as I’ve been a student, I have always appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of my education,” MacLean said. “By emphasizing STEAM, I believe that students will be able to explore many different subjects and also receive the benefits of having broad perspectives on the world that surrounds them.” 
Project Launch is executed by SparkSC, an organization that hopes to inspire a culture of innovation, expose students to their creative potential and make connections across diverse communities. Project Launch has also secured a partnership with Microsoft. 
Kayla Soren, a freshman majoring in international relations, shared how she recently got involved working with both SparkSC and Project Launch. 
“I got involved with SparkSC because I am passionate about entrepreneurship,” Soren wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I was so excited to join Project Launch because I wanted to inspire innovation in high school students. I, like most high school students, never learned about entrepreneurship in school, so I thought this was an incredible program to change that.” 
Kayla is currently heading the 100 Pitches initiative within Project Launch, a mini-version of 1000 Pitches Initiative at USC.
“The high school students are collecting 100 ideas from their school to foster the belief that everyone can have a great idea,” Soren said. “Seeing the reactions of the students being excited about entrepreneurship and even many of them saying that they felt entrepreneurship was now their calling was definitely the most rewarding outcome.”

The Shrine Structure, the parking building behind the Shrine Auditorium, has concluded its construction.
The parking lot will feature 1,300 total parking spaces, including 32 electric vehicle charging spots and 24 handicap parking spaces, according to an email from USC Transportation to the USC community.
The Shrine Structure will become the ninth location for public parking near campus, and will also feature 43 short-term spots for local shops. These spaces will be limited to use for two hours and will cost visitors $2 per hour.
“We plan to keep the new structure as available to the public and permit holders as possible, with its primary occupancy tied to University Village students and retail staff,” USC Transportation said in the email.
With  LED lighting and security on-site 24 hours a day, USC Transportation aims to increase the security of the vehicles parked in the building.
This structure, which will open on April 3, will function as one of the closest parking buildings to the USC Village, which is set to open next fall.
The USC Transportation Office was not available to provide further details.

As the 2017-2018 college application process comes to a close for seniors worldwide, the USC Office of Admissions celebrates the university’s most selective freshman class in its history.
Out of a pool of over 56,000 applicants, an increase of 3.5 percent from last year, 8,980 students received admittance, according to USC News. This 16 percent acceptance rate is also a historic low, decreasing half a percent from last year.
In addition to being the most selective admissions cycle, this year also features the most academically accomplished admits, according to USC News. The average unweighted GPA for accepted students is 3.84 on a 4-point scale, while 31 percent have received a 4.0 GPA.
Archanaa Lingan | Daily Trojan
Over 79 percent of admits scored in at least the 95th percentile on standardized tests, while 42 percent scored in the 99th percentile.
Beyond the academic numbers, however, Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold said USC seeks out students who can contribute to USC’s dynamic intellectual, social and cultural communities.
“[We look to] find something compelling, something that will enrich the USC community,” Brunold told USC News. “These students have a strong character and a willingness to engage in learning, an eagerness to dig deep into scholarship. It’s about the impact these students will have in class, in the library, in the lab and in the community. These students have a unique perspective, and their presence will strengthen the University.”
The newly minted freshman class is also one of the most diverse. Students of color make up over two-thirds of the recently admitted students. Approximately 24 percent of newly admitted students are from underrepresented minority populations — 14 percent of which are Hispanic/Latino and 6 percent are black.
The University said it has also maintained its commitment to expanding financial aid for low-income students who will attend USC. It has increased available aid by 76 percent over the last ten years, and USC students graduate with less student debt on average than students at other colleges, according to USC News.
´Over 2/3rds are of color´….so does this mean that USC is finally shedding their reputation for harboring predominantly the white of the white rich conservatives from the Orange County area? I graduated from USC in the mid-90s and at that time it was full of elitist entitled AHowls! The Greek Row was 90% white with 1 black fraternity and 1 Asian!
Nothing so epitomizes the politically correct gullibility of our times as the magic word “diversity.” The wonders of diversity are proclaimed from the media, extolled in the academy and confirmed in the august chambers of the Supreme Court of the United States. But have you ever seen one speck of hard evidence to support the lofty claims? – Thomas Sowell
He also, in an interview, pointed out that someones individual qualifications should be the tool for admittance, and that someones ethnic or religious group that they are part of should be out of it. Here is a test for those who espouse diversity. Go to the main Campus eatery. Look around the room of tables and chairs, and go outside and do the same. Study the composition of social groups interacting. The majority of it is white students hanging with white students, Asians with Asians, Blacks with Blacks, etc. So where is the diversity but in name? Is that what the University is implying when it uses these numbers? These group quotas mean nothing and should be taken as they are. Worthless to the reader.
Ethnicity shouldnt even be a factor/come into play.  Grades & test scores should be the only determining factors in college admittance.

Photo from Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC WebsiteFostering technology · Yang Chai, the associate dean of the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, is also the director of C-DOCTOR.
USC is one of six California universities in a dental institution collaboration that will receive $12 million over the next three years through a research grant from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. 
The research grant was awarded to the California-based Center for Dental, Oral & Craniofacial Tissue & Organ Regeneration, also known as C-DOCTOR —  a joint venture between several California institutions, including the University of California at San Francisco, Berkeley, Davis and Los Angeles, an Ostrow research team at USC and Stanford University.
C-DOCTOR received the grant for its progress in developing safe and effective clinical strategies for tissue regeneration in the field. The group will act as a nationwide resource for the recruitment, cultivation and clinical translation of innovative technologies to regenerate dental and craniofacial tissues and organs damaged due to congenital disorders, trauma and disease.
USC professors Yang Chai, Yong Chen and Mark Urata are members of the team that received the grant, along with researchers from the other five universities in C-DOCTOR. Bridget Samuels, a senior research coordinator at USC’s Center for Craniofacial Molecular Biology, worked closely with Chai.
“We are trying to identify promising new approaches to engineering dental, oral and craniofacial tissues so that we can replace or regenerate tissues that are lost to … trauma, after surgery or removing a tumor,” Samuels said. “C-DOCTOR brings together all the resources that the research team would need to bring their technology into large animal models and [get] ready for phase one of clinical human trials.”
Samuels said that they had received previous funding from NIDCR, whose program was in two stages. In 2015, they funded 10 groups across the country to start planning the development of a resource center like C-DOCTOR. USC had successfully competed for one of those one-year grants. Now, the grant will help get the resource center up and running as the team looks to put together the strongest group by joining forces with other universities throughout California.
Samuels said the grant will help further the research C-DOCTOR is doing now on stem cells.
“I think right now people are starting to realize the potential of stem cells in regenerative medicines,” Samuels said. “There are a lot of different types of stem cells that have been identified in the dental region, many of them being pioneered by USC faculty. We are trying to understand the different kind of stem cells that are easily accessible because they are in the mouth and use their power to regenerate all kinds of tissues, like bones and gum tissues.”
According to Samuels, these products are not yet available in the market, making it one major direction that C-DOCTOR is planning to look into. 
Samuels said that the first thing the team will do in the next couple of months is issue a request to recruit team members with promising projects. The research team will review the potential members’ proposals and provide counseling on how C-DOCTOR would be able to use these projects to make the best impact in the field.

A study by USC Assistant Professor Ann Owens published on March 17 showed that white families live in more racially homogenous areas than other racial groups. According to the study, white families aim to send their children to predominantly white schools. Thus, white children are less exposed to children from minority groups, and low-income minority children are given limited educational opportunities.
It is important to recognize this issue of modern-day racial segregation as not only a race problem, but also as an economic one in terms of the  quality if education that children receive. It also affects people’s ability to empathize with different communities. USC plays a role here — in its mission of promoting racial and economic diversity in education, the University must work against these forces and promote interaction between students and the community in order to foster cultural understanding.
White children — as Owens points out — will lose out on exposure to minority races, potentially undermining their cultural sensitivity and knowledge about other cultures, and thus increasing the likelihood of future prejudicial attitudes. This segregation further entrenches a familiar cycle, wherein low-income minority children go to schools with less funding than those that wealthier white children attend, thus jeopardizing the quality of education they receive and subsequently their future opportunities.
Take the stark difference between the racial composition of two public school districts in Los Angeles County: Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. In Los Angeles, according to census statistics that Owens compiles, 73.7 percent of students are Latino, while in Beverly Hills, 74.7 percent of students are white. According to Owens, these dramatic differences are primarily due to white families who choose — whether consciously or not — to move to majority-white neighborhoods. This decision segregates schools not only racially but also economically, due to the role that property taxes play in school funding.
Neighborhoods with a concentration of wealthy, white families have higher property taxes, and thus a higher likelihood of schools with better funding and resources. On the other hand, low-income neighborhoods with minority children would see the reverse effect: Schools with less funding and thus an inequality of opportunity for children in these areas. This is a problem that can occur regardless of race — for instance, low-income and racially integrated neighborhoods with a lack of proper funding for schools do exist — but it is one that racial segregation certainly exacerbates.
This then ties in with the lack of exposure that white children have to children of other races. This lack of diversity, while seemingly intangible, is one with very real consequences. The roots of racial prejudice often lie in ignorance. By not acknowledging or being exposed to the experiences of the oppressed, or even seeing how minorities are oppressed at all, it is easy to assume that the status quo of racial discrimination is acceptable. The interactions between white children and children of other races are thus important in shaping their early attitudes toward cultures other than their own. 
When neighborhoods are segregated in the way that Owens highlights, these interactions are limited, if not lost altogether, and characteristics such as cultural sensitivity are less present in the daily lives of white children.
Los Angeles is especially famous for being a melting pot of people of an endless range of different cultures, identities and backgrounds. But despite this narrative, the city is divided into pockets of communities centered on their ethnic identity. In fact, the area surrounding USC features much of Los Angeles’ famed cultural diversity, but the University must do more to promote interaction between USC students and faculty and the community around them in order to foster less homogenous, socioeconomically segregated communities. 
A step toward solving both these issues — the racial and the economic — lies in dismantling the segregation that occurs when white families specifically choose majority-white schools for their children. By promoting racial diversity in both predominantly white as well as predominantly minority school districts, children can interact more frequently with peers of other races, and those who are currently at the mercy of funding imbalances between schools can receive higher quality education.
Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.
What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?
How long would it take anyone to realize I’m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?
And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn’t object to this?
It was an interesting read. If prior studies showed that the segregation of towns and cities, by none other than free market forces, is done by all races, it would have been accurate. For instance, prior to the migration of Southern Blacks to the North. Northern Blacks and Whites lived in harmony. Both groups had the same culture and the same values. When the migration of Southern Blacks, who adopted the Southern White culture (which many describe as “having a chip on your shoulder” and which we have seen evolve into what we know as Rap Culture or Inner City Culture), came to the North. Even Northern Blacks along with their Northern White counterparts distanced themselves from these new comers. In fact it wasn’t until Southern Blacks came to the North that many Northern Schools forced segregation. One in Chicago had it till 1961. Those moves by all parties involved was not driven by race because when Southern Whites came to the North they were said to espouse a culture that drank on Sunday’s, lazy and generally abhorrent to be around (which is what racists claim of blacks today). When Southern Whites moved North the same thing occurred, a form of segregation which is why we see poverty stricken Southern White communities (though less dense than their inner city counterparts) having the same issues with drugs and violence. So it is not a question of Blacks not living with whites, it is not segregation based on ethnicity or race. But rather on the basis of culture. Which if one culture has different values than another, than do not expect those people to welcome integration of different cultures. If that type of culture, though encompassing a minority of the population results in half the murders in the county, then do not expect tolerance. The normalization of this culture is the scary thing and pushing for such a desegregation of culture, either by private or public means, is erroneous. This type of agenda has been pushed before and we have seen drastic challenges. If the author was serious about solving the disparity in education it would recommend the introduction and cut of regulation on Charter and Public Schools. Opening up the private market and allowing the free market to intervene would increase competition, make pay competitive and in the end, as it did in NYC, increase the quality of education for lower income areas (which in NYC were predominantly minority in composition) where it is badly needed.

On Sunday morning, I woke up to the startling and tragic news of another mass shooting — this one having taken place at the popular Cameo Night Club in my hometown of Cincinnati. Though I have never been to this club, the news conjured up uncanny feelings of seeing my Ohio city dashed across national headlines, especially held in association with the sadly familiar and growing phenomenon of mass gun violence in America. 
Later that morning, Cincinnati news station Local 12/WKRC-TV tweeted out an update on the shooting, in which one person was killed and 15 others injured. The tweet read: “27-year-old Obryan Spikes has been identified as the victim shot and killed at Cameo Night Club.” Attached was a photo of Spikes,  a black man, wearing a white T-shirt and staring directly into the camera. It was a mugshot of the murdered victim.
It is with this decision that Local 12, which would later assert that Spike’s mugshot was the only photograph of the victim they had access to at the time and was provided directly by police, descended into the realm of sloppy and careless journalism — so eager to blast out news that it forgot the humanity of the people about whom it was reporting. It is indubitable that Local 12’s initial decision to publish Spike’s mugshot in his death report falls into the shameful trend of criminalizing black men, even after their death. And the frightening implication crawling underneath this tweet, however innocuous it seems on the surface, is that Spike because he was once an inmate, will be forever be held culpable — even to his own murder.
One may even argue that the morning after a shooting is too soon to tweet out a picture of the deceased. Imagine if a mugshot was not provided to Local 12 by the police. Wouldn’t publishing a name suffice? Local 12 later tweeted out a photo collage of Spike posing with two children (presumably his own), but it was too little, too late. The damage was done. And yes, though it is shaky territory to tell a news station to withhold available information at the time it breaks, it is far more lethal to ignore the staggering effects of journalism on people’s perceptions of the world.
The same brand of journalism that thought it would be a good idea to publish a black murder victim’s mugshot is the same brand of journalism that refuses to designate white supremacists who enact racial violence as terrorists, that characterizes South Korean students trapped in a sinking ferry as conditioned by their Asian heritage to be submissive and stay put, that wrote the Washington Post headline: “Amber Rayne, porn star who accused James Deen of sexual assault, found dead.” Deen, notably, is a porn star in his own regard. It is a brand of journalism that regards individuals of marginalized identities with a bias that fundamentally skews the narrative of the story against them.
Though seemingly unrelated, what all these news fallacies have in common are their blatant and insensitive refusal to grant the victims of tragedy dignity even after death, and their insidious typecasting of the victims into stereotypes that permeate into the national conscience. These stereotypes and caricatures, it seems, do not end with a person’s life. Instead, these gross generalizations thrive off the minorities and marginalized who can no longer speak for themselves. 
In all branches of the media, it seems that only white men can escape with the privilege of being seen as full people, with families and histories and past trauma, anecdotes that serve to evoke sympathy if not implicitly justify the hysteria and destruction for which the perpetrators are responsible. They get by with headlines like the Washington Post’s “‘Let’s party like it’s 1933’: Inside the alt-right world of Richard Spencer” and sprawling profiles on the histories of Adam Lanza and Dylann Roof.
It is time for journalists to recognize that they hold the immense responsibility of communicating to Americans but also the immense power of shaping them: how they think and what they notice and what they hold as important. The selective and sloppy piecing-together of information, pulled from preconceived judgments and furthering inherent bias, does not make for good journalism. In fact, it pushes people toward generalizations and quick conclusions and lazy thinking — qualities that journalists have both a moral and ethical imperative to avoid. 
Of course, the press deserves respect, by the people and by the federal government and especially by the President of the United States. But in turn, the press must do its full duty and recognize the volume of its voice on every single level, from those who sit in the White House briefing room to those who operate in local offices churning out articles for city newspapers. The wording of headlines and inclusion of photographs may be — in the grand scheme of things — nitpicky, but not when published by a medium whose purpose is to inform and educate the world.

On Thursday, Bloomberg published a report concluding that, contrary to emerging liberal narratives, capitalism is an economic system that promotes equality. In light of the liberal college environment today, this report is particularly relevant, given the exclusion of capitalist curricula exploring the historical and modern benefits of this economic system from classrooms across the nation. 
Students tend to be highly susceptible to teachings within the university environment, and according to figures from 2011, 12.4 percent of college professors openly identify as “far left” and 50.3 percent identify as liberal. Liberal professors at the nation’s top 40 universities outnumber conservative professors 11.5 to 1. At USC, faculty with voting records favoring liberal policies outnumber faculty with conservative voting records 25.6 to 1. Given liberal hostility to core free market values, this could speak to why more than half of college students shy away from supporting capitalism, according to a 2016 report conducted by Harvard College.
Granted, perspectives about capitalism vary widely among different disciplines and majors. Although business and economics classes embrace the free market, some political science or history courses may not. Additionally, while some students are deeply engaged in learning and understanding economic issues, many are indifferent, rendering college professors the sole drivers for their understanding. 
The age of free market discussion increasingly seems long behind us. Capitalism has long been an academic scapegoat for the ills of society, the most popular counter-narrative capitalism is amoral, favors the rich or is somehow the root of evil. 
It is no secret: Capitalism is the most equitable resource allocation mechanism in existence. It is not central planning or state control of the means of production which has lifted generations out of poverty. Capitalism, which encourages voluntary — not coerced — exchange, is incredibly efficient and is highly equitable. 
Research by the Pew Research Center in 2015 found that nearly 700 million people internationally between 2001 and 2011 were lifted from poverty as a result of free market activity. In the words of famed economist Milton Friedman, “A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.”
Disavowing capitalism is an easy, even indulgent practice. Opponents of capitalism may take comfort in disavowing a system they claim is driven by greed — an easy oversimplification that overlooks historically proven economic principles. Disowning capitalism provides a feel-good option for those who don’t fully understand the free-market economic system under which they live. 
Sympathizing with a professor presenting left-leaning, redistributionist ideas offers students the opportunity to claim moral superiority by writing about idealistic, inaccurate hypotheticals for the less fortunate while living off their parents’ dime in the collegiate bubble.
One result of this is that former Democratic presidential candidate and professed socialist Bernie Sanders’ popularity exploded among millennials — the “me me me generation” — in the past election cycle. Students have yet to set foot in the free market they disdain, so sweeping support for socialist ideals is convenient and logical within their sheltered world. However, with age and life experience, the economic realities will begin to permeate the flimsy cultural basis of the socialist message. According to a 2016 survey conducted by Reason-Rupe, where 53 percent of Americans under 30 have favorable views of socialism, just less than a third of those over 30 do.
Students will continue to misunderstand capitalism unless classrooms begin to incorporate findings like those of Bloomberg’s latest report, which offer the real-world benefits of capitalism and contradict the anti-capitalism narratives that are increasingly permeating into the mainstream, especially among students and young people.
ikr, hasn’t anyone told these millennial special snowflakes sjws & liberal ivory tower egghead profs that commulism killed 500 billion people in the ussr?
“a society that has a high degree of participation trophies and a low degree of voluntary interactions has neither”–milton freedom
A breath of fresh air.  There has never been a system of humans organizing themselves economically that has done more to raise millions out of abject poverty than reasonably free market capitalism.  History demonstrates again and again that central planning does not work, and socialism (force) or socialism-lite requires a totalitarian regime that, again, history shows produces equality of misery.  Just ask the people of oil-rich Venezuela how strong central planning is working.  The path to the 1%, if you so choose, is available to all with hard work, risk taking, innovation, and sometime a little luck and good timing.
I don’t expect the article to outline the Free Market for me. But I back your premise ten fold and loved the inclusion of the Milton Friedman quote, he was one of the greats. You should also plug Thomas Sowell in as well. Both men were brilliant supporters of the free market.
Sincerely,
An Economics Major
i’m not a socialist by any means, but this may be the least convincing opinion piece i’ve read in a long time.

Second Nature Improv hosted Fracas! Improv Festival, the 14th annual improv festival in which various troupes from different college campuses gathered to perform, workshop and learn about comedic improvisation this past week. The event was held at Ground Zero Performance Café.
Thursday, the first night, featured performances from The Charles Darwin Experience from the University of Arizona, NAUghty Bits Improv from Northern Arizona University and The Collective  from the University of Washington. 
From scenes about kids coming home from posing nudes for paintings or drinking with leprechauns, to speaking gibberish as lifeguards, the three improv teams entertained the audience for an exciting first night. At the end, a classic improv jam brought USC students and different improv teams on stage for skits about skydiving and ancient Colosseum entertainment.
On Friday, the festival started off with a Q&A featuring actor Ben Schwartz, writer Gil Ozeri and stand-up comedian Kate Berlant, who all shared their experiences in the comedy world and their paths toward performing comedy for a living.
Schwartz, best known for his role as Jean-Ralphio Saperstein on Parks and Recreation, talked about his experiences at the Upright Citizens Brigade with Ozeri on their sketch and improv team Hot Sauce.
He shared his experience in voiceover work as a consultant for BB-8 in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Dewey in the upcoming Ducktales reboot.
“[J. J. Abrams and I] would write dialogue for BB-8, and then I would say it into [a microphone], and then they would turn it into beeps and boops,” Schwartz said regarding the creation of BB-8.
Ozeri also discussed his experiences performing on the UCB stage as well as writing for a variety of shows. Ozeri is known not only for his credits on shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but also for his unique brand of comedy on Snapchat and Instagram. Over the years, he has found a voice for himself, focusing on evolving and improving his identity as a comic.
“You’re learning as an artist every day about your voice, and that changes all the time,” Ozeri said.
Berlant, known mostly for her stand-up work, agreed with Ozeri and Schwartz about finding one’s voice. 
“You have to do it,” Berlant said. “Don’t overthink it, just try, and it’s a start.”
Overall, the three comedians offered insight on working in the comedy world while engaging the audience with their quick-witted one-liners and hilarious stories.
Friday continued with open improv workshops, followed by hours of improv performances at Ground Zero Performance Café. The night ended with a performance by USC’s own Commedus Interruptus and Merry Men, with skits on fictional films like Uptown Hunk. They also put on a musical performance depicting a group of friends fighting and reconciling with each other by singing the rules of their sorority.
Arman Ashtiani-Eisemann, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, enjoyed watching students from different universities and USC’s own improv troupes perform in the evenings.
“At Fracas!, I learned how good USC is at improv,” Ashtiani-Eisemann said. “Not only do we have four teams, but they’re all incredibly talented. My favorite part of Fracas! was seeing a bunch of friends I did improv with in high school from a number of different universities.”
The last day of the festival featured more workshops and performances as well as another Q&A and live performance from UCB improv shows. Starting the day off was the UCB sketch and improv team Big Grande, featuring three of the four members — Dan Lippert, Drew Tarver and Ryan Rosenberg — answering audience questions about writing sketches and the nature of improv. 
Afterward, members of the UCB improv show Wild Horses gave a live podcast performance at Ground Zero. Four female comedians discussed the merits of live music in coffee shops and the feeling of being an adult on a college campus before performing an improv show based on different subjects of the podcast. Playing four teenage girls ditching high school, the comedians discussed auditioning for the school play, what they think about each other and what they believe sex is really like.
The festival ended with more performances from various improv teams, finally ending with USC’s Spoiler Alert and Second Nature, as well as the final improv jam of the festival.
 Fracas! Improv Festival gave students the ability to explore all of the facets of improv while learning from each other. From the improv performers to the featured comedians, the festival offered students the ability to learn all the possibilities improv and comedy can offer.
Shannon O’Hara, a freshman majoring in molecular environmental biology at UC Berkeley, found the experience very rewarding and useful for her collegiate comedy career. Performing with Jericho! on Saturday night, O’Hara was able to show her team’s comedic style while also being entertained by the troupes before and after her.
“Fracas! accomplishes two really amazing things at once: expands your improv community and tightens your team bond,” O’Hara said. “I loved getting to borrow and learn from other improvisers, but I also gained a profound appreciation for my own team’s dynamic and sense of community.”
Update: A previous version of this article stated USC improv troupes hosted the festival. The article has been updated to clarify that the festival was hosted by Second City Improv at USC.

From stage to screen, bachelor of fine arts students at the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance will showcase their choreography tailored for the camera at Video Stage Live.
 As part of their BFA curriculum, 33 Kaufman students created dance pieces with their peers that, instead of being performed on a stage, will be screened in short films created by the choreographers.
 “There is a different way you want to perform for an audience live and a way you can connect with them through certain types of eye contact and seeing your energy,” said Celine Kiner, a sophomore majoring in dance. “But for the camera, it’s really different. You have to be more active all the time, and you have to think about angles and lines where the camera is seeing you from.” 
The four-year BFA program at the Kaufman School of Dance prepares students for careers in the dance industry. One of its specialties is exploring new mediums of dance for students to involve themselves in.
 The intensive program offers a variety of classes to train students in different concentrations, including performance, choreography for stage and cinema and dance and music. These concentrations are not selected until junior or senior year. In the meantime, BFA students follow a core curriculum that provides them with a comprehensive understanding of dance as an art form.
“We basically had a foundation freshman year of a lot of technique and repertory,” Kiner said. “This semester [we’re taking] ballet technique class, contemporary, Afro-Cuban and jazz, and then we go to our academic classes in the middle of the day. We go to repertory or improv and comp during the afternoon.”
 The core curriculum for BFA students includes an average of 25 hours of dance per week, as well as technique, composition, history, health and theory. One of these core classes is Introduction to Dance for the Camera: New Media and Editing.
 BFA students in Kaufman enroll in this course during the second semester of their sophomore year. The student projects that will be screened in the Kaufman event were created in this class specifically. 
Professor Patrick Corbin aimed to teach students how to tailor choreographic pieces to the camera. Students broke up into groups of three to five and worked throughout the semester on choreographing, filming and editing their pieces.
 Though the students in the course were not film students, they received guidance from their professors on how to start. Corbin and USC School of Cinematic Arts Professor Michael Patterson collaborated to give tutorials on how to use various film software, including Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.
 Kiner’s group took these lessons from their professors to heart.
 “My group particularly tried to incorporate a musical element, which I think is a huge part of comp, and we really tried to engage in a lot of multidisciplinary work,” Kiner said. “It was really eye-opening to see everyone else’s projects and how diverse they are because we are so different as a class, but we work so well as a whole.” 
The screening of Video Stage Live will take place at the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Seating is limited, and reservations are required.

Every senior in college has a few of those moments when they suddenly realize that things that happened in high school happened a very long time ago. I have a well-worn shirt from my glory days on the high school cross country team that is more than five years old. I’m not sure if I should be disgusted at myself for keeping it or proud of myself for fitting into it. This week, I decided to try to fit in another relic of high school athletics — a speed workout.
I hate speed workouts. This type of exercise usually involves repeating short distance sprints with a quick break in between. The idea is to get your legs acclimated to going faster so that eventually, you won’t even need the breaks in between and you’ll be able to run at that sprinting pace for longer spans.
My coaches would chastise me for taking my intervals easy, but I really only have two speeds: jogging and running. Whether it’s an 800m interval (two laps around the track) or a 5K, my running doesn’t get much faster than that. I know it could if I pushed myself to increase the number of strides per minute or picked up my knees more or pushed off my toes more, but those techniques are difficult for me to sustain even for short distances. 
I get to the finish line of races just fine at my normal running pace, and I don’t feel so awful along the way. Especially after training for a full marathon, achieving the mileage seems like a much bigger milestone than finishing at a certain time.
Since college started, I have also been in denial that I run noticeably slower, so doing a disappointing speed workout would make it hard to continue living in my ignorant bliss.
I make plenty of excuses for myself when my long runs clock in slow: I didn’t get much sleep last night, I didn’t drink enough water before I started and I had to wait at stoplights. The truth is I don’t push myself to run harder, and my legs don’t have the muscle memory to run seven-minute miles anymore.
One of my other excuses is that I’ve already peaked. My cross country coach told me in high school that girls peak earlier than boys in running. He said that he’s seen girls peak freshman or sophomore year, while boys will often run their best in junior or senior year. 
That rang true for me, but it might not be related to physiology so much as it is related to the demands of high school. By junior year of high school, I was swamped with extracurricular activities, demanding AP classes and my part-time job at the ice skating rink. By the time practice started at 3:30 p.m., I was pretty much already spent.
While it may have been an accurate observation of high school track athletes, all of the research I’ve seen also disproves this theory. Top track athletes in the Olympics are in their mid-20s. Elite marathon runners are even older. And in fact, the peak age for male runners is lower than female runners. As a senior in college, it’s nice to know I haven’t peaked… yet.
But I also probably won’t peak in my mid-20s if I keep running leisurely the way I do.
So on a Wednesday night, my running buddy Jenny and I hit the track for four 800m repeats with a 200m jog in between. The goal was to complete every single interval in around the same time, within 10 seconds of each other. 
The first one always feels good; it’s exhilarating to push your body to go that fast. From there, it starts going downhill (and not in a fast sprinting downhill sort of way). The second one clocks in just a few seconds slower and my lungs are on fire. The third one is the worst. It feels like the recovery jog was no recovery at all. Every muscle is exhausted, even though I turn in my slowest time that is officially 10 seconds slower than the first one. 
I rally for the last one and for a split second, I realize this pace isn’t awful. I could get used to this. And perhaps, this old high school workout will be part of my weekly routine.
