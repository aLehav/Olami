In a YouTube video with over 48.5 million views, Kyle “Scratch” Jones takes the stage and begins waving his hands in front of him, mimicking the motion and sound of a record pushed back and forth on a turntable.
“What you are about to hear is 100 percent vocals,” he tells the crowd. Jones then launches into an assault of unreal sound, convincingly throwing down record scratches, drum beats and chopped vocal samples as the crowd begins to cheer raucously.
Though beatboxing (as the musical form is called) often just thrills as pure entertainment, USC researchers have investigated it to get closer to uncovering the secrets of human vocalization.
“This study is a part of our long-standing effort in understanding human vocal production, notably human spoken language,” said Dr. Shri S. Narayanan, director of the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab at USC said. “This study of beatboxing is a small piece of that big puzzle we are after.”
The study, which began in 2005, focused on beatboxing because of its complexity and the way in which it stretches the possibilities of the human instrument. The SAIL team spent six years developing the analytical and scientific techniques necessary to fully investigate the data and finally published the study in 2012.
Josh Kun, an associate professor of communication and journalism whose research focuses on popular music and its relation to culture, believes the art of beatboxing showcases the ultimate all-inclusive instrument. In the process, the techniques offer scientists a glimpse into the range of human vocalization.
“Beatboxing would be a very attractive thing to study because it involves the production of so many different kinds of sounds,” Kun said. “It is rhythm and percussion at its core, but also imitating sounds and creating melody lines on top of rhythmic lines. It is a one-man-band kind of act.”
The innovative use of the MRI allowed the researchers to observe the inner vocal dance. The MRI scans, paired with audio recordings, allowed the researchers to acquire a clear picture of the mental and physical processes involved in beatboxing. In the study, the scans were done on a 27-year-old professional beatboxer who is fluent in both Spanish and English. They took images of him creating a wide variety of sounds while recording his voice.
“Our technology allows us a chance to get a window into not just what sounds people produce — and can produce — but to see exactly how they produce it, in greater detail than has previously been possible,” Narayanan said.
According to Narayanan, the video and images of the MRI scans document the subtle intricacies of everyday sound production.
“Seeing the striking similarity between the production mechanisms of the paralinguistic or percussion effects and linguistic or speech sounds was very novel,” Narayanan said. “We were indeed floored by the complex elegance of the vocal movements and the sounds being created in beatboxing, which in itself is an amazing artistic display.”
In addition to conducting further studies on more beatboxing subjects, the SAIL team also hopes to investigate how English speakers are able to create the clicks and sounds that are often found in other languages such as Quechua (spoken in Peru), Xhosa (spoken in South Africa) and Chechen (Chechnya).
“It is very humbling to realize that we still don’t fully understand some of these fundamental human capabilities,” Narayanan said.
But though the science of beatboxing offers insight into the breathtaking amount of physical complexities involved, the art form comes instinctively to many who practice it.
Preston Walker, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law and a member of the student a cappella group Reverse Osmosis, learned by listening to others and blending in new techniques over time.
“You have a language, or a vocabulary so to speak, from which to pull,” Walker said. “The goal is to eventually have such a flexible toolbox of sounds that one can just feel a song and move with it.”
But in addition to the science, one of the main goals the team hopes to have accomplished is introducing the art of beatboxing to mainstream audiences.
“The study is an amazing opportunity for people to understand physical and intellectual complexities of what beatboxing is,” Kun said. “It is the type of study that can change people’s minds about the complexity and encourage people to take beatboxers more serious.”
Nice article about the research going here at USC, but would have appreciated if you’d provided enough information to actually get to more information and the paper itself – http://sail.usc.edu/span/beatboxing/ – as was done by other news organizations.

Despite the end of the 2012 presidential election, many of USC’s more politically minded students have chosen to continue in their campaigning efforts, this time on a local scale in the 2013 Los Angeles mayoral race.
Candidates in action · City Controller Wendy Greuel and city councilmembers Jan Perry and Eric Garcetti respond to questions from South L.A. union members and community residents Thursday night at Ward AME Church. The primary election will take place on March 5.– William Ehart | Daily Trojan
With five major candidates vying for the office currently held by outgoing mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the campaigns have focused heavily on some of the biggest municipal issues, such as local job creation, the public education system and environmental regulation. But elections aren’t won with just words.
The ability to mobilize supporters to vote is critical to the success of any campaign, which is exactly what several Trojans have committed to doing through internships with the various candidates.
Many students who are passionate about politics, such as Kaya Masler, a junior majoring in English and political science, have found interning to be another outlet for their political interests.
“I’ve always loved local politics,” said Masler, who interns for Greuel’s campaign. “[It’s] very exciting to be a part of it all.”
According to Masler, the day-to-day work of the campaign involves everything from making phone calls to voters to organizing official endorsements. Greuel, currently serving as city controller, has gained tremendous momentum following endorsements from major figures such as U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. Yet the most rewarding part of Masler’s experience has been getting to know the candidate personally.
“I think that looking up to our leaders is something that is so lost to us these days,” Masler said. “But Wendy is one person who I can not only look up to, but who also looks at me like a friend.”
Ashlyn Beierle, a junior majoring in political science currently interning for city councilmember Jan Perry’s campaign, felt the same way. Beierle found her internship through USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
“I really appreciate Jan’s commitment to the private sector, which she addressed at the debate,” said Beierle, referring to the mayoral debate at UCLA’s Royce Hall on Monday.
Beierle, who plans on pursuing a law degree, spends 10 to 15 hours a week communicating with constituents and walking precincts to help inform Angelenos of Perry’s platform points.
For Omeed Anvar, a junior studying business administration and political science, there is never a boring day on the campaign trail. Anvar has spent his time working for city councilmember Eric Garcetti’s campaign, conducting policy research and sending out press clips through the campaign’s communications department.
“I love that no two days are the same,” Anvar said. “I’m always doing new jobs for the campaign.”
After working for Sen. Boxer’s office last spring, Anvar sought to become involved in Garcetti’s campaign, which he admires for its innovative use of technology in the political process. Garcetti recently participated in a Reddit “AMA,” answering questions posted directly by voters.
Because the mayoral race is  so localized, Anvar said campus engagement can have a big impact on election results.
“It is so important that USC students get out and vote in the election,” Anvar said. “We are such a large student body and can have a huge impact on who gets put in local office.”
Though each backs different candidates, Masler, Beierle and Anvar all expressed a serious interest in remaining involved in political campaigns, and possibly even in seeking public office themselves one day.
A citywide primary election will be held on Tuesday, March 5. Any candidate receiving a majority in the primary will automatically become the next mayor of Los Angeles. Otherwise, the top two vote-getters will advance to the general election held on Tuesday, May 21.
Students can register to vote for the Los Angeles mayoral election online at sos.ca.gov/elections by Feb. 25 for the primary election and May 19 for the statewide direct primary.

Though the university plans to build an additional fitness center in The Village at USC, the Undergraduate Student Government is working to levy support for improvements to Lyon Center and Recreational Sports.
Spacing issue · Recreational sports teams practice at the Lyon Center from 6 p.m. to midnight. More than 3,000 students participate. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Since being posted Tuesday, a USG petition that asks the university to allocate more resources toward the Lyon Center and Recreational Sports has received 1,400 student signatures as of Thursday at 6 p.m.
A USG survey conducted in the fall showed that undergraduate students care more about improving the Lyon Center than any other issue. The Lyon Center, built in 1988, had its second floor renovated in 2008 as well as the basketball courts and locker rooms renovated in 2011.
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson said the university will build a new fitness center in The Village.
“The reality is that the Lyon Center has nearly 300,000 student, faculty and staff visits per semester,” Jackson said. “This is why the university has plans to construct an additional new fitness center in the University Village when it is revitalized in the next several years.”
USG President Mikey Geragos said the petition will be used as USG lobbies for improvements to Lyon Center equipment and for a large fitness center in the Village.
“We definitely need more athletic space and the most viable location for that is the new University Village,” Geragos said. “Until then, we will advocate for a comparably-sized gym in the UV and advocate for the equipment to be fixed and be in top-notch quality. We’re not going to ask to expand the Lyon Center when a new gym’s coming.”
Though plans for the Village, which will replace the UV, have yet to be released by the university, sources familiar with the project have said demolition alone is not likely to occur for at least one or two years.
Senior Director of Recreational Sports Justine Gilman attributes the lack of recreational sports space to the growing number of residential students, which in turn increases the pool of students eligible to participate in RecSports.
“The club sport program has grown in the last couple years, probably even 20 percent,” Gilman said. “There is a limited amount of space and resources.”
The petition received many signatures when it was first posted on Tuesday, with about three people signing it per minute during the first few hours.
“In one day we got a little over 1,000 responses,” USG Speaker Pro Tempore Matt Arkfeld said. “The fact that we were able to get that many responses in such a short amount of time just proves the importance of the issue at hand.”

Whitney Port, American television personality, fashion designer and USC alumnus, returned to her alma mater Thursday to share with students the story of her unique career path in the fashion industry.
Starling alumna · Whitney Port speaks to an audience of students Thursday night in Bovard Auditorium about career development. – Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
 
For USC’s Career Fest Signature Event, held by the USC Career Center and Spectrum, at Bovard Auditorium, Port walked her Trojan audience through her journey from student intern to professional fashion designer. After transferring from the University of Colorado Boulder to USC for her sophomore year as a gender studies major, Port said her fellow classmates encouraged her to pursue her dream of a fashion career.
“Being surrounded by motivated and smart people is what pushed me to be able to become the person that I am,” Port said. “Everybody at USC has such a strong will and passion for what they want to do, and that just made me want to follow in their footsteps.”
While still a student at USC, Port was an intern for Teen Vogue, which developed into the MTV reality series The Hills, which followed her experience in the Teen Vogue offices as one of the main four cast members. Port said she was very apprehensive to accept the televised internship.
“Honestly, being on TV was something I never wanted to do,” Port said. “I really didn’t know what I was getting myself into, but I decided I shouldn’t be afraid of the unknown.”
Port said that she chose to embrace this unexpected opportunity, realizing that it could help launch her aspirations to be in the fashion industry.
Edward Loera, a freshman majoring in policy, planning and development, said Port’s story as a risk taker was something he could relate to.
“It was amazing listening to such a successful person talk about embracing unexpected turns, because I really try to do that in my own life,” Loera said. “I admire her for doing something out of her comfort zone that obviously paid off.”
Port has since been developing her clothing line Whitney Eve. She said it is a challenge competing with others in the industry, but urged the audience not to be afraid to step out of the lines or to be afraid of failure.
“Why I am here is really to reveal to you guys that you can start something so grass-roots,” Port said. “You shouldn’t be afraid of starting something on your own.”

As the USC women’s swimming and diving team enters its final month of regular-season action, the No. 1 Women of Troy (8-0, 4-0) face two formidable conference opponents bidding for an upset this weekend.
USC will travel to the Bay Area to tackle two-time defending NCAA champion No. 3 Cal (5-1, 2-1) on Friday at 1 p.m. and No. 8 Stanford (5-1, 2-0) on Saturday at noon.
New results? · Junior Lynette Lim (above) and the Women of Troy were unable to defeat Cal and Stanford in their previous meeting. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
History is not on USC’s side, as Cal leads the series 18-14 and Stanford leads the series by a margin of  32-2.
One player looking to start a new trend against the Bay Area schools is senior co-captain and 2012 Olympic silver medalist Haley Anderson, who leads a veteran group of eight All-Americans for the Women of Troy.
Joining her are senior co-captain Christel Simms, seniors Lindsay Parrish and Yumi So and juniors Kasey Carlson, Lynette Lim, Meghan Hawthorne and Stina Gardell.
In USC’s last meet, the Women of Troy defeated Wisconsin (5-6) in a 144.5-109.5 home win on Jan. 12. A day later, sophomore Haley Ishimatsu took first place in the UCLA Diving Invitational in Westwood.
Cal suffered its first loss of the season against Arizona on Jan. 25 but rebounded with a 177-121 road victory over Arizona State the next day.
The Golden Bears are led by their only senior, Caitlin Leverenz, a two-time NCAA champion and a 2012 Olympic bronze medalist in the 200-meter individual medley.
In their last meeting, the Golden Bears defeated the Women of Troy 162-138 at USC. Friday’s meet at Cal will be televised on the Pac-12 Network on a delayed basis, with the date and time to be announced.
Stanford carries three straight victories going into a home matchup against No. 12 UCLA on Friday before taking on USC on Saturday. The Cardinal also defeated the Women of Troy at USC last year 160-5-139.5. USC’s last win against the Cardinal came in 1996.
The Women of Troy look to finish the regular season undefeated, with only three meets remaining before the 2013 Pac-12 championships begin on Feb. 27 in Federal Way, Wash.

After splitting a pair of home games against Pac-12 opponents last weekend at the Galen Center, the Women of Troy now look to strongly finish off their four-game home stand against Utah on Friday at 7 p.m., followed by No. 22 Colorado on Sunday at 10 a.m.
Pushing ahead · Sophomore guard Ariya Crook is averaging 16 points per contest since USC’s 67-62 win on the road against the Oregon Beavers back on Jan. 6, 2013. The Women of Troy are 4-3 over that span. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
On Jan. 25, USC (8-11, 5-3 Pac-12) fell 60-53 to Arizona State at the Galen Center. The Women of Troy led by 16 points at halftime, 36-20, before the Sun Devils rallied in the second half, outscoring USC 40-17 to hand the team its third consecutive loss.
In the defeat, junior forward Cassie Harberts hauled in her seventh double-double of the season with 24 points and 14 rebounds. The Sun Devils’ comeback was primarily because of their hot shooting, as they heated up from 32 percent in the first half to 59 percent in the second half, finishing the game shooting 45 percent from the field.
The Trojans were able to rebound from their previous loss and put a stop to their three-game losing skid with a 74-57 win over Arizona on Jan. 27, shooting 50 percent from the floor in the first half to jump out to a 43-22 lead at halftime. Unlike the Arizona State game, the Women of Troy would secure the large lead and not look back, holding Arizona to only 29 percent shooting compared to their 48 percent.
“We were able to put the Arizona State game behind us, rally together as a team and close out the game,” Harberts said.
The Trojans were also able to force plenty of Wildcat turnovers with 15 steals and moved the ball well as the team finished with 20 total assists. Once again, Harberts led the way with 26 points. She wasn’t alone in double figures this time, as four USC players scored at least 10 points. Sophomore guard Ariya Crook added 15, sophomore guard Kiki Alofaituli had a career-high 11 and junior forward Kate Oliver put in 10.
“Arizona is a very good basketball team, better than their record indicates, and it took a maximum effort to beat them,” USC head coach Michael Cooper said. “We had a little chip on our shoulder from the Arizona State game and I felt that we learned from our mistakes.”
Utah (10-9, 1-7) and No. 22 Colorado (15-4, 4-4) are coming off a pair of games against No. 4 Stanford (18-2, 7-1) and No. 6 Cal (17-2, 7-1).
The Utes dropped both games by sizable margins, losing 65-44 to Stanford and 71-54 to Cal. The Buffs played the games a little closer, but finished with the same results, falling to Cal 59-56 and Stanford 69-56.
The Utes’ Michelle Plouffe leads the team in scoring and rebounding, averaging 16.7 points and 7.5 rebounds per game.
Meanwhile, Colorado is led by Chucky Jefferey, who is averaging 12.3 points and 8.2 rebounds per  game.
USC lost to both teams in their lone meetings last season, falling to Colorado in Boulder 69-67 and to Utah in Salt Lake City 63-55.

I’ve been a little under the weather lately, to be quite honest. It’s flu season, and on a college campus that kind of stuff spreads pretty quickly. Everyone’s coughing or sneezing or chugging DayQuil. The flu can kind of get to your brain, too, and mash things up a little. Sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s what.
So when I read USC head coach Lane Kiffin recently admitted to ESPN’s Gene Wojciechowski that the 2012 football season debacle was his fault, I thought I was delirious. Kiffin, who never admits to having done anything wrong, would now come out and take blame. My flu must have reached a climax: It was playing tricks on me with regard to my university and its head football coach. I figured that when my sickness passed, the story wouldn’t exist and that it had been a figment of my imagination.
Well, I’m feeling better now, and it’s still here on ESPN.com. Kiffin actually held himself accountable.
Kiffin told Wojciechowski, “You got to blame somebody, so you’re going to blame the head coach — and you should. I blame myself for this.”
Wait, what?
Is this the turning of a corner? Is this Lane Kiffin 2.0, reborn as a new man as suggested yesterday by fellow columnist Nick Selbe?
No.
Though I do believe Kiffin probably does feel a little bad for the travesty that was USC football this past season, I struggle to actually believe that Kiffin is turning over a new leaf here. Call me a cynic, but talk is cheap.
Nothing in this interview really leads me to think that he actually takes the blame for this. Kiffin tells Wojciechowski about the gaffes he made this year, including the deflated ball and the jersey-changing scandal with Cody Kessler. Wojciechowski notes that Kiffin, “[Has] no anger in his voice. He speaks about the incidents as if they were clinical studies.” That’s the Kiffin we all know.
If Kiffin were really sincere, maybe he’d show some emotion. If I had gone 7-6 with the most talented team in the country, I’d be pretty upset with myself as a coach. But again, it’s a stone-faced and monotone Kiffin that we get. College football is a game of emotion; you have to show some on occasion, even when you’re the figure at the center of the controversy. And again, it’s severely lacking.
People were taken aback by this article, including Wojciechowski, because Kiffin admitted to mistakes. But until there’s action, I’m calling this a bluff.
To truly show that he’s truly learned from his mistakes, the first thing that has to be done is a complete makeover. Kiffin must look in the mirror and take initiative. If he really wants to turn this ship around, he’d hire an offensive coordinator and actually coach this team.
After the Sun Bowl, the ESPN article reported that Kiffin “‘lost the locker room.” It’s not hard to see why. He usually has his head buried in his play-calling chart, more concerned with what play to run on second-and-7 than about motivating his team as the game takes place just a few yards away from him.
Step one, Lane, is to coach. Let someone else handle the play calling. Lead these young men. Because unless you do, no one else is going to. Players take on the identity of their coach, and if they see you acting nonchalantly about everything on the field, they’re going to act the exact same way.
Hiring a new defensive coordinator was a step, and these “admissions” sound really nice. But, until a change occurs in the way that Kiffin actually coaches and handles himself, I’m not buying any of it. I’m not saying that Kiffin can’t change, and that he isn’t going to make these changes (though, knowing his track record, it seems doubtful). The bottom line is that to acknowledge faults is one thing, but to actually alter the way you handle things is another.
He has step one down, but I don’t see step two happening. A tiger doesn’t change its stripes. Coaches tend not to change regardless of circumstance. So if fans are looking for a completely transformed Lane Kiffin, they probably aren’t going to find one. The only way to see such a change would be to imagine it in delirium. Maybe we should all get the flu.
 
“Goal Line Stand” runs every Friday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Michael Katz at katzml@usc.edu.
The blame actually rests with Pat Haden, who lacks the b-lls to fire Kiffin.  Haden is a weak AD who should return to his prior life.  On the other hand, I’d never hire a lawyer who isn’t a fighter…
It’s possible Kiffin isn’t cut out to be a head coach. Maybe he should stop at OC but I am not impressed with his play calling. Who throws to the FB who can’t catch on a critical 4Th  and short in  multiple games . Kiffin does.  I luv that play with the right personnel but if you don’t then…  Who doesn’t use the TE and other great receivers? Kiffin.  No creativity. Who runs up the middle with no oline at goaline?  kiffin.  goes on and on.
Amen, brother~
How come Kiffin is reminding me of “Wait Until Next Year” Neuheisel?  Perhaps in the near future, they can join forces manufacturing widgets or whatever else ex-coaches do after getting fired from a plum job.

The USC women’s tennis team was again impressive in a 7-0 sweep of No. 33 Pepperdine on Thursday in Malibu.
Senior leadership · Senior Danielle Lao was a major contributor in USC’s sweep of Pepperdine, winning in both singles and doubles play. – Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
USC head coach Richard Gallien, for one, was thoroughly pleased with how the Trojans handled a foreign environment.
“Anytime you go to another school’s court, it might get a little prickly,” Gallien said.
The match started off in doubles play with a brand new combination at the three spot consisting of sophomore Zoë Scandalis and freshman Ellie Yates. The duo controlled the match from start to finish and won in convincing 8-1 fashion.
Sophomore Giuliana Olmos and senior Danielle Lao clinched the doubles point with an 8-3 victory that suspended an extremely intense matchup on court one between USC’s top-ranked doubles duo of junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria and Pepperdine’s No. 4-ranked combo of senior Khunpak Issara and sophomore Lorraine Guillermo. The match ended with Christian and Santamaria trailing Issara and Guillermo 5-4.
Gallien has been very impressed with Olmos’ effort in her first year as a playing member of the squad.
“Giuliana is a monster, she is a beast,” Gallien said. “She has a great attitude, and she is hard to beat … she immediately makes us a contender.”
The Women of Troy’s success continued in singles play, where momentum never shifted in favor of Pepperdine. In fact, the Trojans never lost more than two games in a set during the first four singles victories, started off by senior Valeria Pulido’s near perfect 6-0, 6-1 victory at the six spot. Christian was just as dominant at the five position, tallying up a 6-0, 6-2 win over the Waves’ Megan Moore to put the Trojans up 3-0. That win was followed by reigning Pac-12 player of the week Olmos, who took a 6-2, 6-1 victory on court four.
No. 17 Santamaria was equally impressive, piecing together a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Pepperdine’s Guillermo to give the Trojans a 5-0 lead on the day. Lao dominated Ale Granillo with a 6-4, 6-0 win, and finishing the match was Scandalis, taking a competitive 10-5 match to keep USC’s sweep streak alive in 2013.
The Trojans entered the match ranked No. 4 and to date are still undefeated, with a record of 4-0 on the year.
After visiting Malibu, the Women of Troy will return home to Marks Stadium on Saturday for a match with the Fresno State Bulldogs at noon. That match will be the last before the Trojans head to Virginia to participate in the ITA National Indoor championships. Gallien is intrigued about matchup possibilities with national standouts, with players from the University of Michigan and Baylor University, and believes that he has “a hardy group.”
One potential concern for Gallien in an otherwise flawless beginning to the season is the collective health of his squad.
“Gabby [DeSimone] didn’t play today with the knee and Zoë [Scandalis] has a banged up foot, so I am assuming we’ll have some time to heal before next Friday,” Gallien said.

The USC men’s volleyball team embarks on a crucial early season road swing Friday, attempting to improve on its 2-2 start to the season.
Starting fresh · The USC men’s volleyball team is still adjusting to the losses of All-American players Tony Ciarelli and Steven Shandrick. Ciarelli was the 2012 national player of the year. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The Trojans will square off against Pepperdine in Malibu on Friday night, kicking off a three-game slate that will also see them face Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State in the span of a week.
After a season-opening loss to UC San Diego, the Trojans rebounded with huge wins over UC Irvine and Stanford but suffered a 3-1 setback at the hands of Pacific on Sunday at the Galen Center.
With 10 days and ample practice time in between matches, USC head coach Bill Ferguson emphasized the need to pay attention to detail.
“We’ve mainly been focusing on things on our side of the net,” Ferguson said. “We’re a really talented group, but we have a lot of practical inexperience, so we’re trying to get everybody used to the discipline that it takes to essentially win a championship.”
After consecutive sweeps of Irvine and Stanford, the Trojans struggled considerably to develop a rhythm against the Tigers, attacking at a percentage of just .180. Moreover, Pacific edged USC in blocks (16.5 to 12.5), digs (46 to 39), and aces (4 to 1). Sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera led Troy with 12 kills off the bench, while junior opposite Tanner Jansen registered five blocks to go along with nine kills. Freshman outside hitter Alex Slaught notched eight kills and sophomore setter Micah Christenson led the defensive effort with 12 digs.
“We’ve been focusing in practice on trying to execute our game plan,” Jansen said. “We’ve been trying to focus on taking away things they [Pepperdine] like to do, and matching it with things that we like to do.”
Citing previous examples, Ferguson particularly stressed the importance of discipline over talent.
“If you look at teams [in] the past couple of years that have had success, and if you look at the difference between the 11th team and the 12th team, the 12th team wasn’t necessarily as talented as the 11th team, but they were far more disciplined,” Ferguson said. “So we’re trying to bridge the talent gaps with the departure of four guys that played first division volleyball.”
Replicating the team’s 2012 championship run will be a newfound challenge for the Trojans, who have tried to adjust following the departures of outside hitter Tony Ciarelli —  the 2012 national player of the year -— and All-American middle blocker Steven Shandrick. The departures, combined with the heavy presence of underclassmen, have forced Ferguson to make constant tweaks to the lineup.
“The things that jump off the page are service errors and attacking errors, so we need to improve those areas,” Ferguson said. “At the outside position, we’re looking at Rivera and [redshirt freshman] Austin Rysyk to take another step up after making great strides in the fall. I also want to see a higher level of consistency out of Jansen. He started poorly against Pacific, but when we put him in later he did very well. If we can get a higher level of consistency, then that’s great.”
For his part, Jansen noted the significance of each game in a long season.
“I think we can’t look past any of the games,” Jansen said. “For some of the big games, we come in ready to go, but for some of the smaller games, we have a tendency to overlook them. So, we need to focus on treating each game equally.”

Historically, the Super Bowl weekend has always been one of the weaker weekends of the year for films simply because so many people, particularly men, are watching the big game. Last weekend wasn’t the worst, with the No. 1 film Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters beating expectations by being so bad it’s good while the other two releases bombed for simply being bad. Though the industry loves a rebound, this isn’t the weekend to do it.
The only film in the past few years that has ever broken out against the Super Bowl was Taken in 2009; however, many people forget that the film was already out in Europe for several months and was almost released direct-to-DVD.
Still, studios have had some mild success with releasing a film aimed at non-football loving audiences.
In 2010, Dear John became a moderate success and last year both Chronicle and The Woman in Black were able to find a sizable audience in spite of the big game.
This year, Summit Entertainment hopes to convince people to skip Super Bowl Sunday with Warm Bodies, a zombie romantic comedy. The zombie-genre revival that’s been going on for the past several years has yet to rescind, with The Walking Dead being the most-watched show on cable, a Zombies Mode being a staple of the Call of Duty franchise and even the bizarre zombie-esque news stories from last year (don’t do bath salts, kids).
You know a genre has hit the mainstream when filmmakers are able to make wild deviations.  For Warm Bodies, starring Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, we have a zombie protagonist who begins to come back to life as he falls in love. Though some people might dismiss it as a “Twilight with zombies,” the studio has done a good job with the marketing to sell a rather strange concept to a skeptical audience.
However, genre mashups tend to be one of the harder sells in the business, especially horror genres.  For every Zombieland, you have a handful of bombs like Slither and Fright Night, even though those films had good reviews overall.  Nonetheless, it’s the primary option for female audiences and it has a unique enough concept to intrigue the curious.  It could surprise with more than $20 million, but a slightly lower amount is more likely.
The other film coming out this weekend is Bullet to the Head, starring Sylvester Stallone in the lead role. Though he’s been prominent in the box office, thanks to The Expendables franchise and the well-received sequels to Rocky and Rambo, this is actually his first solo feature since 2001’s Driven.
This film was originally scheduled to be released April 13, 2012, but was delayed to this weekend for undisclosed reasons. It doesn’t take an expert, though, to know that Warner Bros is effectively just trying to get the movie out without much fanfare.  Not to mention that the audience this film is trying to appeal to will be too busy watching football on Sunday to see a generic action thriller.
Stallone has picked up a considerable amount of goodwill through successfully relaunching his most famous characters, but even his most die-hard supporters can tell this film won’t do well. It could end up earning the same numbers as The Last Stand, which was in the similar position of featuring an old-school action star trying to make a comeback but failing to do so.
Then there’s the gangster dramedy Stand Up Guys, starring Al Pacino and Christopher Walken as a pair of old criminals going out for one last night on the town before their past comes back to haunt them. If you feel surprised that you haven’t even heard of this film, it’s not your fault.
Despite the box office potential of uniting these two legendary actors in a film that’s essentially The Bucket List for wise guys, for some reason, Lionsgate saw fit to effectively dump the movie into theaters with hardly any marketing. It isn’t even releasing widely, only opening in about 450 theaters (the average wide-release film opens in 2,500+ theaters).
Though the reviews haven’t been great, you have to imagine that there would be at least a little bit of an audience that’d go see Pacino, Walken and Alan Arkin having a good time on the big screen. Sadly, with the nonexistent marketing, the miniscule awareness and in small release, this film might not even be able to make over a million this weekend.

[…] Zombie flick looks to score a touchdown The only film in the past few years that has ever broken out against the Super Bowl was Taken in 2009; however, many people forget that the film was already out in Europe for several months and was almost released direct-to-DVD.

Lights created waves that washed over the crowd as video montages on giant projectors lit up Staples Center with old news clips, battle scenes and, of course, a very familiar logo. The trademark guitar chords and synthesizers of The Who sent shock waves through the crowd that undoubtedly made the middle-aged folks who remember their rock years feel like they were seeing the band again for the very first time.
He might be 68, but Roger Daltrey can still rock like it’s 1964, and the frontman for The Who teamed up with legendary lead guitarist Pete Townshend to blow the roof off of the Staples Center for more than 15,000 attendees in spectacular fashion. It was a performance for the ages, and one that truly captured the electrifying spirit of the rock shows of old.
Daltrey and Townshend, the last two surviving members of the original four, replaced the late drummer Keith Moon with Zak Starkey and former bassist John Entwistle with Pino Palladino. The band opened with its album Quadrophenia, a rock opera that tells the story of the four personalities of Jimmy, a fictitious English teenager in 1965. They blasted hits like “Love Reign O’er Me” and the montage of news clips from the ’70s all the way through the Occupy Wall Street movement created the sensation of a true journey through time. Daltrey, who appeared in a button-down shirt and gray blazer, eventually lost the blazer and, in characteristic fashion, left the shirt unbuttoned for the rest of the night. Pete Townshend donned his dark grey sunglasses and a white blazer, which he eventually ditched (to facilitate his signature right-arm windmilling on the ground).
Entwistle and Moon might have been replaced, but they were not forgotten. Bringing an air of nostalgia to the crowd who fondly remember the original bassist and drummer, videos and audio of them performing live were interspersed with the band’s production of Quadrophenia, as if the original four were back again.
Daltrey, who underwent vocal surgery in late 2009 to remove a pre-cancerous growth, was last in the spotlight when The Who performed at the 2010 Super Bowl halftime show. It was only after being heavily criticized for his failure to hit high notes that Daltrey revealed that he had the surgery. Yet Thursday’s performance was an incredible improvement from the Daltrey two years ago as he belted out “We Won’t Get Fooled Again,” “Baba O’Riley” and “Pinball Wizard” with no trouble at all. Though Daltrey opted not to attempt some of the more daunting notes at the end of the songs, the main lyrics shot through the Staples Center in the same manner fans have known for years.
Starkey, the son of former Beatle Ringo Starr, made a perfect replacement for Moon. Many consider Moon to be one of the best drummers in rock history, and his antics (drum explosions, hotel-room destruction and impromptu nudity at parties) will likely never be replicated. But Starkey, who learned the drums from Moon, played the part well. His beats allowed Daltrey and Townshend to rock their most famous songs as if Moon was there with them. Starkey continued the tradition of clothing removal, with his flamboyant white jacket disappearing midway through the first set. The drummer, who Townshend described as “fresh from the operating table,” sported a brace on the left wrist but seemed to bang away with ease.
After two-and-a-half hours, The Who had Staples Center rocking with their biggest hits from throughout the years. As the band gets older, fans know that their touring days are numbered. Daltrey, though, is optimistic.
“My doctor say’s he’ll have me singing into my 80s,” he crowed.
After last night’s performance, it is clear that an entire generation will be there with him.
I’m with Nate. It would have been more relevant to mention the 2 USC Alum in the article…considering it IS the Daily Trojan. Although, I am biased because I’m married to one of them. I was present Wednesday at Staples Center for this show. Amazing energy from the entire group. Great show!
They didn’t play “My Generation.”   Have you ever heard the song?  There are the words “My my my generation” in the song “5:15” from Quadrophenia but that song sounds nothing like “My Generation.”
Daltrey did in fact sound great.  I would disagree that they blew the roof off the place.  The volume was surprisingly low for any rock concert, certainly for the Who, Townshend’s tinnitus notwithstanding.
This is a good article featuring information about the concert and The Who but it is unfortunate.  It is unfortunate because two of the musicians sharing the stage with The Who last night, as well as the rest of the tour, were current students of the USC Thornton School of Music.  There was no mention of this in the article.
[…] Daily Trojan: “He might be 68, but Roger Daltrey can still rock like it’s 1964, and the frontman for The Who teamed up with legendary lead guitarist Pete Townshend to blow the roof off of the Staples Center for more than 15,000 attendees in spectacular fashion. It was a performance for the ages, and one that truly captured the electrifying spirit of the rock shows of old“ LA Times: “The Who could very well have hobbled its way through this show. After all, few acts can withstand the loss of a rhythm section as thick and thrilling as bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. (..) Townshend and Daltrey in their late 60s, one could be forgiven for wondering whether they’d be able to pull it off. (…)  When they kicked into “The Real Me” after the opening instrumental, any doubts about strength and endurance vanished“. OC Register: “Makes for a lot to chew on at a concert, especially when there aren’t many radio staples during the first 90 minutes or so – which helps explain why these shows aren’t selling out at triple-digit prices. Not every Who fan cares for this particular work, not as much as Tommy anyway, and the number of dutifully trotted-out warhorses at the end hardly justifies anyone but die-hards springing for tickets“.

During the eight years that Samit Varma spent on a nuclear submarine, he had one thing on his mind: pizza. Now, seated at a table in his very own pizza restaurant, the Marshall graduate still marvels about being able to put his dream in action and start a create-your-own-pizza business.

Growing up, some of Varma’s favorite memories were in his mother’s kitchen, creating his own pizzas.
“At my parent’s house, we would make these crusts, and my brother and sister and I would make our own pizzas. I have always thought that there should be a restaurant concept that does this,” Varma said.
After going to the Naval Academy to study mechanical engineering, Varma was sure that his pizza-making days were over. As the years went on, though, he realized he still missed the days spent cooking with his siblings in his mother’s kitchen.
Varma decided to go back to school and received his master’s in business administration from USC’s Marshall School of Business. He spent time at a software startup and a venture capital firm. It was then he decided that he was ready to finally bring the experiences of his mom’s kitchen to life. But to do this, he realized he would need help.
“I didn’t have any restaurant experience, so I needed to find someone amazing that did,” Varma said.
That’s where Ron Biskin came in. A former president of Wolfgang Puck, Biskin had 25 years of restaurant business experience under his belt. With a partnership established, the two set out for pizza glory.
What makes The Pizza Studio unique is its concept of food design. Varma recognized that customers like nothing more than to eat their own custom creations. The huge variety and unlimited options ensure that anyone can find a combination that suits them, so making a bad pizza is simply impossible.
Upon entering, customers can select one of four crust types: traditional, whole grain and flax, rosemary herb or gluten-free. The crust, which Varma said took eight months of testing to develop, is pressed before being garnished with a choice of tomato, basil pesto, olive oil or tangy BBQ sauce.
For $7.99, each pizza is loaded with an unlimited amount of toppings, which include four different cheeses, nine meats and countless vegetables. The mozzarella is block-shredded in-house, and the meats are sliced as they arrive from a deli that’s had its doors open for 75 years.
Varma says he takes no shortcuts with his pizza.
“We really focused on the product. We wanted to make the pizza fantastic,” he said.
The Pizza Studio also offers special “Starving Artists” options for just $5.99 including Margherita, pepperoni, Veggie Lovers or white pizza.
The innovation at The Pizza Studio doesn’t stop with the ingredients, though. The double-convection-style oven, which Varma had custom-designed for the restaurant, cooks the pizza faster than customers can pay, fill up their soda and sit down.
“You literally go from raw dough to pizza on your table in four minutes,” Varma said.
Despite its emphasis on, well, pizza, The Pizza Studio is about more than just dough. The custom-made decorations, local artwork for sale on the walls and the modern design create a relaxed, friendly environment for customers.
Varma said the culture he found working in the submarine inspired him to go that extra distance with his restaurant.
“In the submarine force, what I tried to create on my ship was a really strong culture,” he said. “I’m rebuilding that culture here by emphasizing pride of ownership and exceeding expectations.”
Varma said he was also inspired by the Trojan Family. He knew he wanted to open his first shop right next to USC and has already hired several Trojan staff members.
“I’ve always been connected to the Trojan community and the business school,” Varma said. “We believe that being close to the university has a lot of advantages for us.”
Varma said that he hopes The Pizza Studio will eventually become a household name.
“We believe pizza is one of the most popular food groups in the country and that this opportunity doesn’t limit itself to any particular area,” he said.
Varma clearly has a hard time containing his excitement. When asked about his goals for the future, he smiled triumphantly.
“I’m a company builder, and that’s what we will do,” Varma said.
 
The Pizza Studio is located at South Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard and is open every day from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Visit them online at mypizzastudio.com.
Made my own pizza at Pizza Studio the other day. AWESOME! Go Trojans!
Just discovered it today.  Excellent quality pizza, friendly staff, and I like all of the choices.  Inexpensive and quick too. Would love one closer to where I live!

In the early hours of Sunday morning, at least 235 young adults lost their lives in a fire at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil. Tears have been shed, but from the ashes, an opportunity to create a safer, more civil, less rule-bending community should be salvaged — not just at the club, but in international society at large.
The current details revealed have raised some eyebrows. That night, a crowd of 2,000 people — more than Kiss’s legal capacity of 691 — packed the club to hear the band Gurizada Fandangueira play.
According to CNN, “during their performance, the band used pyrotechnics that they were knew were for outdoor use only,” opting “to buy this particular firework because it was cheaper than the indoor-use kind.” When the fireworks set off, the ceiling caught on fire and things spiraled out of control. In the aftermath, investigators said they found evidence of faulty and fake fire extinguishers at the club, which had expired fire and municipal licenses.
Given this scenario, it’s easy to begin finger-pointing. Was it the club’s fault? The band’s fault?
Maybe even the clubgoers themselves? What about the security personnel that supposedly blocked clubgoers from leaving because they thought that revelers were trying to skip out on their bills? In search of an explanation, people will blame it on overcrowding, irregularities in the construction of the nightclub and so on. So far, four people have been arrested — a band member, the show producer and two club owners.
Though it is only fair that someone should be punished for an obviously fixable mistake, focusing on the blame game does not solve anything or move the issue forward so that future tragedies can be prevented. The only way to not let this tragedy have happened in vain is to do something to change, to push forward, learn and never forget.
Of course, outdoor pyrotechnics should be banned from closed spaces. Of course, a place with the capacity to fit this many people should not be overcrowded for any reason. Of course, there should always be more than one fire exit to buildings. But to condemn the staff and owners of Kiss just shows that we’re not looking at the bigger picture.
The tragedy that has befallen the Kiss nightclub could have happened anywhere, and it’s time for a wake-up call for all clubs and public event spaces worldwide to reform and become more aware of the consequences of ignoring safety measures.
If not, the issue will become a vortex of guilt and destruction, as recent news of one of Kiss’ club owners attempted suicide already demonstrates. The suicide attempt happened while he was being held under police guard at a hospital, where he is being treated for smoke inhalation.
Moving beyond self-blame to really do something about the issue at hand is key. Let this tragedy be a wake-up call to spark change for all clubs, to raise awareness of true danger and to set up precautions so that people having fun can be safe rather than sorrowful.

Because of the attacks on the American embassy in Benghazi, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton found herself in front of the firing squad known as Congress in a special hearing to determine if her actions directly led to the deaths of several Americans.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
As a reputable news source, Fox News decided to cover the hearings, yet it was almost impossible to ignore the obvious bias the network has against liberal ideologies.
Pick up a newspaper, watch a segment of the news or tune into the radio station, and a realization will transpire: You’re either reading, watching or hearing a human.
And ultimately, human beings err. Human beings make blanket statements and rude comments. They lie, cheat and tell half-truths. Somewhere in all of this human error lie journalists — individuals who are paid to remain unbiased and provide society with the facts.
Unfortunately, society cannot hold humans to unattainable standards of fairness and balance. Part of the problem is that the public argues that the media must be completely unbiased, while simultaneously thirsting for for riveting news stories and explosive headlines.
Viewership depends on the nature of stories, and more often than not, media outlets sensationalize stories to increase viewership. For instance, the saying “if it bleeds, it leads” emerged from the increase in crime reporting among news organizations.
But is it entirely wrong for news outlets to pay the bills using these tactics — especially when society seemingly would much rather feel entertained than intellectually stimulated?
Admittedly, the media’s actions are unforgivable in some instances. Portraying First Lady Michelle Obama as “Obama’s Baby Mama” on Fox News is inappropriate for all American audiences. And condensing Clinton’s congressional testimony into four mocking bullet points such as, “Hey guys — this stuff is hard!” is both inaccurate and disrespectful.
And though conservative media outlets are often critiqued for their ridiculous proclamations, liberal news sources must also be examined.
The Western Center for Journalism points out the copious ways in which media has tipped in favor of leftist movements such as Occupy Wall Street. Moreover, Huffington Post reporter Michael Calderone compares the strong liberal opinions of MSNBC hosts to conservative Fox News hosts.
Human beings obviously have opinions, but media outlets cannot pretend to be unbiased when their shows and hosts push a specific sort of agenda. As long as these news sources admit to their positions, then the public will better understand the nature of the news that they’re digesting rather than fall sway to a skewed version of events.
A study conducted by Farleigh Dickinson University polled a variety of viewers using currents events questions. They determined that NPR viewers were among the best informed, and viewers who preferred watching Fox News were the worst informed.
Perhaps this information shows that the public may not even have to focus on bias in media, but rather on the content and depth of the information shared. The American people should feel capable of answering questions regarding economic sanctions or the level of unemployment as citizens of this nation. But if news sources fail to provide the people with the objective facts necessary to participate in energizing conversation, they fail society altogether. If the only things the American people can discuss after watching a segment of Fox News are gossipy, mean-spirited details about the Obama family, a drastic change is necessary.
One cannot watch Fox News or MSNBC and expect completely impartial reporting. No matter how hard a journalist might try, their individual beliefs will almost always manage to creep its way into a story, especially if an organization promotes a particular angle.
Though we might trust the media with informing us of the news, gathering the most correct version of the facts is still up to us.

Really!  CBS, NBC, ABC and CNN were not biased toward George Bush while he was in office and mean spirited towards him. You have a short memory. Never mind how the lame stream media crucified Sarah Palin. If a Republican had been in office during Benghazi. The media would have covered it properly. There was an initial cover up at Benghazi because it was on 9/11 and Obama and Clinton would have looked bad. Then they lied about what happened. They were derelict on 9/11 because they refuse to understand we are in a war on terror. The truth is the media is now the enemy of the American people and refuses to asks the tough questions on US policy domestically and internationally, because there fellow progressive is President. American politicians are our servants voted in by us and accountable to us and not above the law. People died in Benghazi and someone must be held accountable or it will happen again. As for people making mistakes and give them a break, I can’t believe this is coming out of mouth of someone taking international relations at the university level.  This is not a Kindergarten play lot. We elect our leaders to pardon my pun LEAD. They must be held accountable for their decisions as most grown ups I know do. I taught my son to “take responsibility for his actions” and to accept the consequences of those actions. I would be disappointed if he made a mistake and lied and covered it up on top of that. As for the name calling done by the media from both sides, it is called freedom of speech and press. Freedom of speech is not just acceptable for pleasant speeches and on subjects we agree with, but on subjects contrary to our own views . Too often today on college campuses free speech is stifled because students do not like what the speaker has to say. This is a dangerous road they are going down on when they deny free speech.  What other lines will they start crossing that erode other freedoms such as religion, press etc.

Saturday, January 27th, USC’s Thornton Symphony Orchestra and Concert Choir performed Sounds About Town at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Nearly all the seats were filled with students and families. It’s rare to see so many younger people at classical performances, but this time, Trojan pride won everyone over.
The USC Thornton Symphony Orchestra performed to a full-house on Saturday, playing pieces from Gershwin and Prokofiev, among other legendary composers. — Courtesy of Michael Dowlan
Audience members applauded excitedly as Carl St. Clair stepped onto the conductor’s podium. His faculty profile provides a comprehensive summary of his many achievements, but – for the sake of a quick highlight – let it be said that he has amassed successes all over the globe. Only three years ago, St. Clair conducted and recorded Wagner’s Ring Cycle in Berlin. During Saturday’s performance, St. Clair was energetic and invested in the music. The weight of each bass line and delicateness of the lighter areas were each distinctly visible in his body language.
Despite being advertised as a concert version of Porgy and Bess, the concert began with selections from Prokofiev’s ballet Romeo and Juliet. The opening number was the epic Montagues and Capulets. The piece lives in every extreme of sound; beginning with an increasingly loud cacophony of instruments, it moves fluidly between the clash of the two families and Juliet’s gentle innocence. The Thornton Symphony demonstrated great skill and control in their flawless rendition of the piece. Their sound filled every nook and cranny, leaving the audience in a mesmerized silence.
Ending the Prokofiev portion with Death of Tybalt, the orchestra moved onto the main performance of Porgy and Bess, an American folk opera written by George Gershwin. The story focuses on African American life in Charleston, South Carolina during the 1920s. The opera was not performed in its entirety, instead performed as an extended medley of sorts.
In the introduction, the Thornton Symphony beautifully captured the sound of bustle in a busy city. Bar set high, the orchestra continued with the same excellence. Their sound had all the body of a classical orchestra and the attitude of a jazz band, perfect for a Gershwin piece.
With a perfectly professional sound, the Thornton Symphony belies the fact that its instrumentalists are all undergraduate and graduate students. Each section was balanced so as to not over power another section or a soloist. On the subject of soloists, it’s not uncommon for them to sound hesitant or make mistakes due to nerves; however, in their Saturday concert, they all sounded practiced, clear and natural.
The same cannot be said for the vocal soloists, Kevin Deas and Angela Brown. Though obviously professional, with years of concerts under their belts, their contribution was far from stellar. To begin with, they attempted to act out their parts, but their emotions were exaggerated and campy. As far as singing chops are concerned, Brown has a large soprano voice with beautifully floating high notes; however, many times she was drowned out by the orchestra. Deas, a baritone, was difficult to hear as well, but did not have the saving grace of high notes. Both had issues with diction; it was difficult to understand what they were singing. Despite these shortcomings, the soloists had pleasant voices.
In contrast, the Thornton Concert Choir matched the orchestra’s excellence. Whether singing a chorus or a song in their own right, the choir made the concert hall ring. A large group with powerful voices, the choir complemented the orchestra, easily making themselves heard even over the loudest portions. Unfortunately, the choir wasn’t given much of a role as they mainly sang backup to the soloists. Hopefully in their next joint performance, the Thornton Concert Choir will have a greater role.
Near the end of the performance, the choir and Deas had some fun with the song It Ain’t Necessarily So. Deas exaggerated many vowels and imitated an old man while the choir mimicked his vocal antics. The comedic dynamic inspired laughter and applause in the audience.
When St. Clair lowered his arms a final time, the audience gave a standing ovation, cheering and whistling until the group gave in to an encore. They replayed Lawd, I’m on My Way, an extremely spiritual piece with a full bodied sound. As the audience hailed the performers, the soloists and the conductor congratulated each other with hugs and friendly handshakes. Even the students applauded their efforts.
One aspect of the concert to note was its length. The concert was performed without intermission for no longer than an hour and a half. The audience had no time to get bored and antsy, and instead stayed fully engaged.
USC’s Thornton Symphony Orchestra and Concert Choir have proven to be engaging and greatly talented in their renditions of Romeo and Juliet and Porgy and Bess. Their hard work and dedication clearly showed in their performance. With never a dull moment, the Thornton musicians have created a showcase USC can be proud of.
