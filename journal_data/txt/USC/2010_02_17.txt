Who knew that freedom of speech doesn’t extend to facial accessories?
OK, so the Bill of Rights doesn’t guarantee one’s ability to provide shoutouts during college football games by writing messages on eye black ­— those small, dark strips you see your favorite players wearing just above their cheekbones. And as history has shown, if the NCAA can deprive collegiate athletics of fun, it will do so at the first opportunity.
The NCAA Football Rules Committee proposed last week to ban college football players from putting any words, logos or symbols on their eye black, according to the Associated Press. It’s so long to hometowns, family members and mantras. The tributes were fun while they lasted.
This applies to USC, of course, because our own Reggie Bush is credited with starting the movement. Once the running back scribbled the “619” area code on his eye black to represent San Diego, everyone wanted to make a statement.
Rey Maualuga honored his late father in writing. Mark Sanchez could have filled a rolodex with the names he displayed after a season. Allen Bradford wrote “I promise” on his eye black to remind him of the guarantee he made to his father that he would make it to the NFL and provide a better life for the two of them.
Only the NCAA could look at all of these examples and somehow be offended.
Sure, eye black can also be a platform for controversial speech. Florida quarterback Tim Tebow used his face as a billboard for Bible verses this past season. And Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor wore eye black with a message supporting current quarterback and former convict Michael Vick, one of the sport’s most indefensible characters.
Advocates of the rule have cited a fear of what this practice could turn into, but is anyone really expecting a player to come trotting on the field with a four letter word written on his face or, better yet, an advertisement for BulkBeefJerky.com?
Former USC head coach Pete Carroll told the Los Angeles Times last September that he and the school’s equipment managers monitored the players’ messages and held the right to prevent any message from making it to the field. But apparently institutional control isn’t good enough for the NCAA.
What’s really sad about the proposed rule is that it provides yet another avenue for the NCAA to sap players’ joy from the game of football. Carroll’s team was special because it beat other teams and had fun doing it.
In the modern-day landscape of collegiate athletics, athletes have dwindling opportunities for self-expression. It’s easy to see why so many of them would embrace the chance to show appreciation or make a statement given how regimented their daily lives have became.
Some will argue that writing on eye black is the latest development in the generation of me-first athletes. But is anyone really offended by a short statement that will largely go unseen except on television? Until Tebow came along, writing on eye black was usually personal.
It’s really unfortunate that the NCAA sees fit to inject itself into the matter. If I weren’t graduating in May, I would protest by wearing eye black with my column name written on it whenever I went to the press box. But I guess I also don’t have the bone structure to pull off that look.
And I encourage anyone to look back into the eye black archives if they believe the practice isn’t entertaining. I couldn’t help but smile whenever I saw Brian Cushing with “FEEL ME” plastered across his face. And the most memorable recollection I have of USC’s 69-0 drubbing of Washington State in 2008 in Pullman, Wash., is USC wide receiver Ronald Johnson using his eye black to support Barack Obama’s campaign.
But somewhere at the NCAA headquaters in Indianapolis, there’s a group of curmudgeons who don’t see the humor. Maybe they’d lighten up if someone would just throw a shout-out their way via eye black every once in a while.
Feel me?
Apparently not.

A contingent of Trojans heading to Tempe, Ariz. usually means a forthcoming USC-Arizona State football game.
This time, however, the tone is a little bit different.
After months of speculation and intrigue, USC officials will finally get a chance Thursday to hear from the NCAA infractions committee on violations the football and basketball programs might have committed.
Officials from the athletic department will present statements and answer questions while meeting with the 10-member NCAA infractions committee and enforcement staff.
The meetings will be closed to the public, but a court reporter will be present and the proceedings will be recorded.
The infractions committee can then either decide to impose sanctions of its own against the athletic department or decide that the departments’s self-imposed sanctions to be adequate.
The self-imposed sanctions included the USC men’s basketball team vacating wins from the 2007-2008 season and a forfeiture of all postseason activity for the current season.
The Trojans will forgo the Pac-10 tournament and will not accept any invitation to a postseason tournament, including the NCAA tournament and the National Invitational Tournament.
Although reports about who will attend the meetings on behalf of USC have conflicted, the Los Angeles Times has reported that former USC men’s basketball coach Tim Floyd will be present. The Times also reported that former USC football coach Pete Carroll might appear, either in person or via videoconference.
Athletic Director Mike Garrett and outgoing university President Steven B. Sample are also expected to attend the meetings.
The meetings will take place over the course of a few days, but the final public report and decision might not arrive for another 10 weeks, as has been the case in recent NCAA hearings, including Florida State University and the University of Memphis.
After extended hearings of their own, the Florida State vacated 12 football victories and were placed on probation for four years by the NCAA. The Seminoles also had six total scholarships deducted from the team over the course of three consecutive recruiting seasons.
The University of Memphis’ sanctions included more than $500,000 in fines and the forfeiture of 38 victories from the 2007-2008 baksetball season.
USC needs to put its house in order. As a close friend and Northwestern MBA once said to me, “people don’t go to Northwestern to play with balls”….or something close to that. USC as one of the nation’s great universities cannot let ball playing in all shapes affect its academic standing and rankings. Parents pay an incredible price to have their offspring attend this university. Atlhletes and overpaid coaches cannot ruin what it means to be a real Trojan, not just a jock. Carroll blew town knowing what was coming, and Floyd well he’s just plain lacking in ethics it would appear. Garrett needs to be dismissed in my opinion, he can’t duck this one. Let’s wait and see but it’s more than time for ‘SC to put things in order, and that means putting the football and basketball programs in their proper prospective. This is a university after all, it’s not the NFL, and they needn’t be pursuing a #1 ranking for its own sake. It’s gotten them, exactly nowhere it seems. I’d rather they be in the USN&WR top 10 than the AP top 10….that’s what it’s all about.

Maybe some home cooking will do the Women of Troy good.
After games on the road up north at California and Stanford and a trip to Westwood against their crosstown rival, the Women of Troy return home to the Galen Center for two games.
Tough stretch · Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath was below her season average 13.4 points per game during the four-game losing streak. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Wating for the Women of Troy at home are two visiting squads which could afford USC a chance to get back to its winning ways.
“It’ll be good to get our feet back under us,” said sophomore guard Ashley Corral. “Washington State and Washington are two very beatable teams, so we’re just going to have to come out and play hard.”
Next on tap for the Women of Troy (13-10, 7-5) are the Washington State Cougars (6-18, 1-12), who occupy last place in the Pac-10 conference.
Despite the Cougars’ record, the Women of Troy know they cannot overlook any opponent with their recent stretch of play.
“All the things that we haven’t been doing in the past have finally caught up to us,” Corral said. “Those are all things we can change and fix, but we just need to go out and do it.”
One specific thing the Women of Troy can fix is their effort on the defensive glass. They rank last in the Pac-10 in rebound margin, allowing their opponents to outrebound them by six boards per game.
“Rebounding has been our Achilles’ heel all season,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.  “Rebounding is just heart and desire and who wants it more, and other teams seem to want it more than us, but we got to find some people who want to do it.”
In the first meeting between the USC and Washington State, the Women of Troy managed to pull out a come-from-behind victory with a strong second half.
Playing hard, however, from the opening tip-off is one thing the coaching staff has continually been stressing to the team.
“[Coach Cooper] always stresses to play hard. We always have a tendency not to come out strong in the first half, but I think we need to come out strong at home and play hard the whole game to put [the Cougars] away early,” Corral said.
One player who can give the Women of Troy a boost is redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos, who was heralded as the top recruit in the nation upon entering USC.
After suffering numerous knee injuries the past three years, Gemelos has provided the Women of Troy with solid play off the bench in their three games. She will be making her season debut at the Galen Center against the Cougars.
“I’ve been waiting to play here so it’ll be nice to finally play in front of the USC crowd,” Gemelos said.  “It’s going to be exciting.”
With the Women of Troy returning home and Gemelos finally healthy, the team hopes to get back on the winning track.
“I think we’re all mad and we’re ready to take it out on our next opponent, and I think we’ll respond in a very positive way,” Gemelos said.
Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m.

After sweeping its three-game homestand, the USC men’s basketball team (15-9, 7-5) will take to the road to compete in conditions significantly less welcoming than the friendly confines of the Galen Center.
Scoreboard filler · Sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic averaged a double-double of 11.6 points and 10.6 rebounds per game over the Trojans’ current three-game winning streak. Vucevic also leads the Pac-10 in rebounds per game, averaging 9.8 rebounds per contest. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
In the first stop of their doubleheader tonight, the Trojans will face Washington (17-8, 7-6), who is currently in a two-way tie for fourth in the conference. The Huskies post a Pac-10-best 16-1 record at home but have struggled to pull away in the standings after going 1-6 on the road this season.
“[Washington’s] energy at home in that building is unbelievable,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “The way they play at home is different. The second time around you play teams you change some things, and we’ll definitely make some adjustments. We’re going to have to make sure we control the tempo because if we play at their tempo we’ll lose.”
So far this season, the two teams have demonstrated polar opposites strengths. The Huskies, who average 81.1 points per game, enter tonight’s matchup ranked first in the conference and 19th in the nation in scoring but second to last in points scored against per game. The Trojans, on the other hand, are second to last in the Pac-10 in scoring but continue to be ranked among the top-five teams nationally in defense, averaging only 56.4 points allowed per game.
The last meeting between the teams ended in a lopsided 87-61 victory for the Trojans, who turned the tables on the Huskies and dominated offensively. Senior forward Marcus Johnson led the Trojans with 22 points as he shot 82 percent from the field, and all five USC starters recorded double-digit point totals. Washington was unable to find its rhythm offensively, as senior Quincy Pondexter was held to two points on 1-for-10 shooting.
“I know [Pondexter] didn’t have a great game last game, and I know at home he’ll be looking to score,” said Johnson. “He’s athletic, he’s strong and he’s real versatile. It’ll be a good matchup.”
The road trip is the second to last of the season for the Trojans, who only have six games left because of self-imposed sanctions prohibiting the team from participating in the postseason play. The Trojans have only won one game on the road this season, but they didn’t have to leave Los Angeles to do so — the win came against UCLA.
Nevertheless, O’Neill said he feels confident in the Trojans’ ability to travel, despite their road losses this season.
“We’ve had our chances. We’ve been very competitive in every game we’ve played in the conference,” O’Neill said. “I expect that we’ll give ourselves a chance to win going down the stretch.”

Local Natives is an energetic five-piece whose fame train seems to have gained enough steam to carry these Los Angeles locals into a much larger eminence. The band recently made an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, secured a spot on the top of festival bills with My Morning Jacket and even found itself on the receiving end of some love from Pitchfork.
Camera talk · After moving to Los Angeles from Orange County, Local Natives began recording what would become its debut album. - Photos courtesy of Tell All Your Friends PR 
But in order for it to be catapulted into this exotic world of hipster fandom and Yim Yames elbow-rubbing, much is riding on its freshman full-length effort, Gorilla Manor. Good news — much goes right.
First, these guys know how to make an entrance. On the opener “Wide Eyes,” the band carefully introduces each element of its sound, making a mission statement before even a minute of the album has elapsed. The song begins with 10 seconds of a simple-but-sprightly guitar riff — a good sample of what is to come. Cue five seconds of pounding drums, a couple seconds of decorative bass and a small taster of winding rhythm guitar. This is all before the vocals — singing not-so-profound lyrics — enter the track.
The vocals aren’t stunning, but for some reason it works. And the three-part harmonies taken on catchy tracks like “Shape Shifter” hide the band’s shortcomings in vocal layering that draws comparisons to Grizzly Bear. Like “Wide Eyes,” nothing groundbreaking will be found here lyrically, but that is never a problem. The songs are more than appealing with an alluring two-guitar meandering sound and focused drumming propelling the record forward. Local Natives’ two guitarists, Ryan Hahn and Taylor Rice, play Keith Richards and Brian Jones, respectively, weaving in and out of the rhythm/lead mechanic and establishing the flow of songs such as “Sun Hands” and “Wide Eyes.”
Again, though “Wide Eyes” is not the best song on the album, it is the best example of this sound, and, consequently, the best introduction for newcomers. “Sun Hands” succeeds with this dynamic on a higher level.
It’s neither a challenging dynamic nor is it original, but the dueling guitar duo keeps it interesting with the assistance of drummer Matt Frazier. On most of Gorilla Manor’s tracks, the drums are very much in the foreground, a risky aesthetic decision that, in this instance, is a good one.
“Sun Hands,” driven by this interplay between the guitars and percussion, is a certain standout. It cannot be stressed enough how well the band works together on this track. The chemistry is so astounding that it would be hard to imagine this song not being a memorable shout-along during the band’s approaching set at Coachella.
“Sun Hands” is just one of many tracks on Gorilla Manor that are ready to be played on a big stage. But that is the most fascinating thing about these Los Angeles-based newcomers — on Local Natives’ much-hyped first album, the band sounds ready for the big leagues.
“Camera Talk” sounds like a band at its prime. It’s a song Phoenix would have stuck on its fifth album, or a track that a more mainstream Dirty Projectors would have shoved on Bitte Orca.
Local Natives functions like a well-oiled machine, and, after giving a brief glimpse of each cog at work, the dynamic of the band is seamless. Some bands struggle with being over hyped, especially as early as these guys had to deal with it.
This debut is not perfect, but, in the very engineered music climate that is present-day indie music, comparisons to Grizzly Bear and Phoenix are all a group needs to launch it into the mainstream circuit. And if it validate those claims, as Local Natives has done on Gorilla Manor, the summer-festival track is their oyster.
Local Natives has navigated a tricky line here, somehow managing to meet the inexplicable hype with an exciting record. That record, which does just enough right, should be exactly what it needs to launch its speeding buzz-train into the higher stratum of eminence that seems destined by the pre-album optimism.

These days it might seem like Google is a villain in the style of old pulp adventures, plotting to take over the world from its secret lair. Googleplex isn’t an underground, Ken Adams-designed base and CEO Eric Schmidt isn’t Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but the analogy isn’t far off.
The Internet and software company has been rapidly expanding in recent years, launching new programs aimed at seizing a chunk of the social media. However, this might be a case of great effort and poor execution on Google’s part.
Google released its latest pet project, Google Buzz, Feb. 9. Buzz is essentially Google’s attempt to make a stake in the social networking realm and take on Facebook and Twitter.
Buzz is an add-on to Google’s e-mail system, Gmail. It acts as a kind of catch-all RSS feed for different sites like Flickr, Twitter, YouTube and Blogger. Instead of going to all of those sites, Buzz puts all of the information streams in one place. It even has Facebook-style “liking” options for the posts. The idea seems to have been to create a one stop-shop application that would eliminate the need to go to each of the websites individually.
But Buzz can’t compete with the social networking giants. The application is limited only to Gmail users, and, since Gmail is not used universally, the user pool is intrinsically limited. At the same time, it is difficult to turn off, and the constant stream of feeds and updates leaves a simple Gmail page cluttered, so anyone who tires of it is in for a hassle in shutting off the application.
Another key problem with the program is that it automatically makes a contact out of anyone a user has communicated with, even if the user doesn’t want it to. Who wants everyone attached to their internship application e-mails and Craigslist purchases to suddenly pop up in the same frame as current friends and co-workers? It is definitely a privacy error on Google’s end, and one that’s already earned it a strong backlash.
Google Buzz comes in the aftermath of Google Wave, the company’s attempt to make a message board and collaboration hybrid that seemed to be an evolution of the iGoogle concept. Despite strong hype — invitations to use it sold on eBay — Wave failed to impress because of a combination of a confusing interface and advertising oversaturation.
While both Buzz and Wave have ultimately been disappointments, the show of ambition on Google’s part is clear. The company does not want to simply be a search engine or an e-mail server. It wants to be the reigning software and application host for Internet users, specifically the younger, college-aged demographic.
Gmail is already popular with students, and iGoogle, with features like Google Documents, is used on campuses across the world. Google Chrome has become a popular web browser, competing with Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer. Google clearly has a popular and expansive software library, and its popularity with college students is only growing.
Yet, taking on the social networking giants seems too bold a move, even for Google. And that’s not counting the fact that Buzz was essentially just a way to link Gmail to sites like Twitter and Flickr. It isn’t even a fully independent networking site.
Part of the problem is that Google is trying to become a social networking center from the top down. It’s a kind of corporate-run attempt at getting people to interact. It might get a few users, but what ultimately made sites like Facebook and Twitter popular was grassroots growth. They grew from word of mouth and popularity, not because a company created them and relied on reputation. Wave and Buzz failed because they were not natural trends.
Google needs to refocus and try something new. The company needs less integration and more innovation. Gmail and iGoogle were a hit because they offered something new — a streamlined, cleaner approach to an existing technology. Simply offering to host information from different sites isn’t creative — it’s borrowing.
Google clearly has the resources to do something revolutionary outside of search engines, but right now it needs to go back to the drawing board. While these recent attempts might have ultimately failed, the ambition is clear, and it is only a matter of time before the next big Google application comes out. The company wants to be the pre-eminent Internet software developer, and it could easily succeed. The only question is how soon will Google make that goal a reality?
Who knows, maybe Google’s global Internet domination will come sooner than we think.

The Elvis younger generations are familiar with wears white rhinestone jumpsuits, calls himself the King and speaks in a drawl that is deep, slow and sluggish — warped by the winds of time and Las Vegas.
Loving you · Photos of a young Elvis Presley are on display along with some of the stars artifacts. The exhibit runs through March 28. - Photo courtesy of Alfred Wertheimer 
What they don’t know is that Elvis was once a lively boy from Mississippi who read Betty and Veronica comics and gave all of himself to anybody that would watch.
“Elvis at 21: Photographs by Alfred Wertheimer,” a new exhibit at the Grammy Museum, displays a series of portraits of the young rock star being a 21-year-old. Wertheimer captured Elvis at his most intimate moments as well as his most public — on stage and at the studio during the revolutionary year of 1956, when Elvis first shot to the forefront of the American consciousness.
He set himself apart from others of the time, and Wertheimer gives viewers unedited glimpses of the young, ambitious artist. Even in the selection of black and white photographs, Elvis comes across as fiery and bright — a starburst with the intensity of someone who knows his fate is to be the best.
There are portraits of a woman weeping upon meeting him, fans staring at him incredulously as he swings his hips to the rhythm and blues of “Heartbreak Hotel” and a shirtless Elvis listening to records with his high school sweetheart.
He shares a kiss (with tongue!) with a young, giggling redhead in a dark alley and in the next frame, he jumps gleefully into his parents’ swimming pool. In these images, Elvis embodies the homeland hero attitude. He was a rebel from America’s heartland who loved James Dean, Marlon Brando and gospel music.
This is Elvis, deconstructed, before he bought the Graceland mansion and well before the public dissection of his personal life that has become immortalized in today’s popular culture.
Wertheimer harnessed an unassuming artist who was open to a camera looking into his personal space in a honest, candid way — free of the uncomfortably voyeuristic feel of contemporary reality television.
There are no drunken, dignity-stripping moments of weakness from a barely legal young man but rather small moments of closeness with a rock demigod. He is more of an adolescent Hercules than Zeus in Wertheimer’s collection, a flirtatious, contradicting personality that was half puppy and half stallion.
The collection even includes a photo of a relaxed Elvis resting on couches between studio sessions and tour stops. In the photo, Elvis crosses his legs casually to reveal argyle socks, his hands resting on his legs, one hand flashing a chunky pinky ring.
To accompany the photographs, the Grammy Museum pairs its wall with a constellation of various Elvis artifacts.
Visitors can see the artist’s first guitar from Tupelo Hardware, a dirty brown mess from 1945, held together by tape and the careful veneration of a mother’s care. A wrinkled pair of white leather shoes is also on display, well worn by the artist’s signature gyrations, right underneath the gilded, embellished leather copy of the Presley family Bible.
One of the most striking pieces, however, is a small letter written to an unnamed fan. On pink letterhead, Elvis answers one of his many feverish love letters, which he would famously shred after reading so that the contents were truly just for his own eyes.
“There is somebody in this world that is meant for you,” he scrawled in a wild, almost-careless cursive.
“I don’t love you and I doubt I ever would, so please, let’s be friends. Please understand.” Elvis wrote to his pining fan. Of course, he does not end the letter without asking for a picture of her for his scrapbook.
That play between honesty and naughtiness — the artful, seductive contradiction — is what Wertheimer captured, and that juxtaposition of personalities, histories, races and cultures was what made Elvis who he was.
The contrast in the photographs, the sharp pale cheek of his passionate followers with the deep fire of Elvis’ pulsating eyes mid-performance, is the root of the fascination, the essence of what made the boy an artist and a prominent obsession of the American mind.
Elvis was the ultimate American seducer, and “Elvis at 21” is a small peek into the star’s spirit.
Great write up about the exhibition. I was one of the editors who worked on the show, and the folks here at the Smithsoninan are particularly proud of this one. If YOU’RE an Elvis fan, you can be one of the first to submit your Elvis-inspired videos to the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service’s YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/sitesExhibitions.

Angelenos tend to anthropomorphize their pets more than the average American. To validate this, one needs only to visit the Grove and view the garish parade of dogs dressed in frilly orange pinafores and novelty tees — a canine fashion trend that would perhaps make more sense on the East Coast, where the temperature actually drops below a balmy 65 degrees Fahrenheit. (And Elle Woods was right: “Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.”)
For those who believe their pets deserve the best, there is an inexhaustible market for designer clothes, gourmet food and posh resorts, all tailored to the quadrupedal. Los Angeles even offers myriad pet cemeteries for Fluffy’s final journey to the giant litterbox in the ground.
It only makes sense, then, that there is a niche in the market for a company that tailors to the needs of the evangelical pet owners of America. Eternal Earth-Bound Pets offers the very latest in animal care for those who fear they will leave a special someone behind after — what else? — the second coming. While the company’s ethics have come under fire, they target an undeniably profitable customer bloc. Earth-bound pets might not be as crazy a venture as it seems.
For some citizens, the famed biblical Rapture is about as pressing a danger as California’s “big one;” historical precedent tells us it will happen someday, and we can only hope that, when the tremors come, we’re prepared. For a small group of American fundamentalists, however, preparation for the afterlife involves more than just having a clean conscience — it means providing for those who will be left behind.
Biblical canon holds that pets don’t have souls; thus, Rapture theory proposes animals will not be allowed on the figurative bus to heaven once the time comes, leaving them to wander earth with nonbelievers, sinners and Yankees fans. Eternal Earth-Bound Pets promises on its website that each “representative is a confirmed atheist and as such will still be here on Earth after you have received your reward.”
For the fee of $110, members will be matched with an atheist animal rescuer (currently available in 22 states); the company guarantees the rescuer will reach the stranded pet within 24 hours of Rapture (depending on traffic and general carnage, of course). The fee insures owners for a decade, at which point members can renew for a reduced rate. Apparently, more than 100 pet owners have already signed up for the service.
It seems like a great way for the wayward sinner to make a few extra bucks, but one can only wonder how a business model like this is ethical; the company is making it’s money based on an event it believes will never happen. How is this any different than selling invisibility cloaks or Walt Disney’s frozen remains over the Internet?
Surprisingly, Eternal Earth-Bound Pets follows the same business models as many insurance companies, according to an AOL news article. “[Insurance] premiums are based on the likelihood that the company will have to pay out money for claims,” said Jennifer Fisher, a professor of ethics at the University of San Francisco, in the article. Essentially, insurance companies are betting against the fact that a customer will need to file a claim.
In fact, Earth-Bound’s site rather defensively defends its ethics. A portion of the FAQ section states, “Being an atheist does not mean we lack morals or ethics. It just means we don’t believe in God or gods. All of our representatives are normal folks who love and live for their family, and are gainfully employed.”
It seems Eternal Earth-Bound Pets is putting a new spin on an old practice. While it has already received a fair amount of flak, the fact remains that its business is by the books and legal. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

[Ran into this web article a short time ago which indicates that the famous “rapture” of funnymentalists is actually a 19th century crock!]
        PRETRIB RAPTURE SECRECY
             by Dave MacPherson
     The word “secrecy” when applied to Christ’s return can refer to two different things: time and visibility. Before 1830 the only coming Christians looked for was the “every eye shall see him” second advent to earth – secret only in point of time.
     Enter Margaret Macdonald in 1830. She saw “the one taken and the other left” before “THE WICKED” [Antichrist] will “be revealed” – and added that her pretrib rapture would not be “seen by the natural eye” but only by “those who have the light of God within.” Her rapture was doubly secret: at an unknown day and hour and also invisible to “outsiders.”
     Desperate to eliminate Margaret as the pretrib originator and the Irvingites as the first public teachers of pretrib, Darby defender Thomas Ice foolishly claims that they taught a secret POSTTRIB coming even though he knows that when Hal Lindsey teaches “one taken” etc. before the Antichrist “is revealed” Lindsey is expressing the kernel of the pretrib view – what MM and the Irvingites clearly taught before Darby did! Google “X-Raying Margaret” and “Edward Irving is Unnerving” to see why they are properly labeled “pretrib.”)
     As early as June 1832, Irving’s journal taught that only “to those who are watching and praying…will Christ be manifested…as the morning star. To the rest of the church, and to the world, this first appearance will be…unintelligible.” (“Present State of Prophetic Knowledge” etc., p. 374)
     Always trailing and “borrowing” quietly from the Irvingites who in turn had “borrowed” from Margaret, Darby in 1845 finally sounded like them when he wrote that “the bright and morning Star…is the sweet and blessed sign to them that watch…And such is Christ before He appears [at the final advent to earth]. The Sun will arise on the world….The star is before the [Sun], the joy of those who watch. The unwakeful world, who sleep in the night, see it not.” (“Thoughts on the Apocalypse,” p. 167)
     And Lindsey’s “Late Great Planet Earth,” p. 143, says that “the second coming is said to be visible to the whole earth (Revelation 1:7). However, in the Rapture. only the Christians see Him – it’s a mystery, a secret.”
     My bestselling book “The Rapture Plot” (available at online stores including Armageddon Books) has 300 pages of such documentation and proves that Margaret was the first to “see” a secret, pretrib rapture, that the Irvingites soon echoed her in their journal (which Darby admitted he avidly read), and that Darby was last on all of the crucial aspects of dispensationalism.
     Shockingly, all of the earliest pretrib development rested solely on unclear OT and NT types and symbols and NOT on clear Biblical statements. Margaret’s rapture was inspired by Rev. 11’s “two witnesses.” And her “secret visibility” rested on the “types” of Stephen, Paul, and John – all of whom saw or heard what others couldn’t see or hear.
     For 30 years Darby’s pretrib basis was the rapture of Rev. 12’s “man child” – actually his plagiarism of Irving’s usage of this “pretrib” symbol eight years earlier!
     As I said at the start, the “second advent to earth” is secret in point of time with its unknown “day and hour,” as Christ stated. Pretribs assert that if Christ returns for the church after the tribulation, we could count down the days and figure out the actual date of His return – which would contradict Christ’s words.
     But pretribs deliberately ignore the fact that Christ said that the tribulation days will be shortened – and He didn’t reveal the length of the shortening!
     Our opponents also assume that the “watch” verses prove the “any-moment imminence” of Christ’s return. But do they? II Peter 3:12 says we are to be “looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God” which all premills claim is at least 1000 years ahead of us and therefore hardly “imminent”! What’s the difference between “watching for” and “looking for”?
     You have just learned a few of the many secrets that the Secret Rapture Gang has hidden for a long time. Evidently they have forgotten Luke 12:2’s warning that “there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed”!
     PS – For the ultimate in uncovered secrets, see engines like Google and type in “Pretrib Rapture Dishonesty.”
forgive my typos.  I just had my hooves done.
Lucy,
Thanks for the article on my post rapture pet rescue business. 
Just for clarification… I also do not believe in alien abductions.  However I  would be more than happy to insure a believer in same against his possible abduction, and any injuries sustained during the alien’s infamous “probing” process.   
Naturally, unlike the rapture where open graves of the faithful, and the instant disappearance of  millions of God fearing Christians would be self evident,  I’d need objective verifyable  evidence before an alien abduction payout.
Yours in reason,
Bart

The past couple of months have thrown a series of speed bumps at the Toyota Motor Corp. 
First, the auto manufacturing giant was forced to recall 3.8 million vehicles in October to replace faulty floor mats. Within the past month, the car company recalled 2.3 million vehicles to repair gas pedals, and last week it voluntarily recalled 437,000 hybrid cars to fix the software that controls the brake pedals.
Unfortunately, this recent string of recalls is not a new phenomenon.
Consumers have been complaining about Toyota gas pedals since 2001, when the manufacturer redesigned them to react to electronic sensors rather than physical pressure. Reluctant to start a thorough investigation of the complaints, the problem persisted. As a result, multiple people died in crashes, unable to regain control of their vehicles as they accelerated to excess speeds.
In addition to the tragedy of accidents resulting from the malfunctioning components, the Toyota situation is disconcerting as owners find themselves in a dangerous state of uncertainty.
“My Toyota is not a recalled model, but honestly I still don’t feel safe,” said Paige Hill, a senior majoring in public relations. “They have recalled so many vehicles it’s like I’m constantly wondering when mine will be recalled also.”
“I don’t feel comfortable with what Toyota is doing … the way they handled the problem wasn’t very good,” said Tim Kinzer, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Although information has now been released to Toyota drivers about their vehicles, the company informed consumers at a snail’s pace. Toyota should have investigated the issues when buyers started complaining in 2001, and the public should have been made aware of the issue immediately. Had the company done so, it’s possible many of these issues could have been rectified.
Now, it appears that Toyota is adopting the better-late-than-never philosophy.
After a dormant period that produced little to no information, the company has shifted into another gear. Rather than dwell on the “should haves,” Toyota is finally taking action and making a push to inform the public about its recalls, repairs and regrets.
On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that 500,000 cars have been fixed and 50,000 repairs are being completed daily on affected vehicles. Toyota released an advertisement apologizing and promising to prevent future accidents from occurring. Dealers have extended service hours on nights and weekends to fix more cars as rapidly as possible and, to top it all off, the company is considering offering significantly longer warranties to earn back its consumers’ confidence.
In making these moves, Toyota is taking the hit gracefully as it estimates a total loss of $2 billion during the time that it halted production and sales.
Despite the well-deserved beating Toyota has taken, could there be a light at the end of this dark road?
The company is repenting and mending its mistakes. Surprisingly, it appears consumers have noted such efforts.
Of the four student Toyota owners I spoke to, all four said they would still consider buying a Toyota in the future because of their loyalty to the company.
“[Mistakes] happen to everybody and other companies have messed up before,” said Arjun Sharma, a junior majoring in computer science.
Three students who do not own Toyotas said the recalls would not stop them from considering the company for a future purchase as well.
“Because Toyota has been considered a vanguard … I have a feeling they’re going to make a comeback. They made a mistake, but I feel like they’re going to improve upon it,” said Garrett Weaver, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering.
While media pundits continue to spur on the demise of the Toyota corporation, it appears the sentiment toward the car company is not as negative as many might believe. Despite its current losses, Toyota shows potential for remaining a leading car manufacturer after this mess is resolved.
Rather than looking into the rear view mirror and regretting what should have been done differently, Toyota is actively informing consumers about its cars as quickly and effectively as it can and is taking the proper corrective and preventative measures.
That’s all we can ask for at this point.

The University of California recently announced that it would begin using wait lists this spring for fall 2010 freshmen applicants.
Officials confirmed last week that at least six of the nine undergraduate UC campuses will follow suit, while the California State University system will expand its use of the lists, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Recent state budget cuts have caused UC and Cal State schools to decrease the number of incoming freshmen students on their campuses and the practice of using wait lists can help the universities better reach their enrollment targets.
High school counselors, however, said they worried about the emotional effects this practice could have on students. In an already stressful time of waiting for college acceptance letters, the uncertainty of being placed on a wait list can add anxiety — a student placed on a wait list might choose to wait for the university’s response, perhaps jeopardizing his acceptance at another school.
The National Association for College Admission Counseling found last year that only about 30 percent of students who opted to be wait listed were offered enrollment.
USC has traditionally avoided the practice of using wait lists, instead choosing to admit a small number of students for the spring semester.

Bikes are loosely locked to racks outside of Doheny Library. Although bike theft is going up around Los Angeles, there is less theft than usual around University Park.
Daily Trojan | Tim Tran


Who cares? People don’t want bikes anymore–the bike ban kills owning a bike.  Stealing a bike isn’t worth the ticket.

First Karen O gathered together a group of elementary school-age kids to help record the soundtrack for longtime friend Spike Jonze’s Where the Wild Things Are.
Now, it seems that other independent artists are also acknowledging the (not-so-much-younger) youth.
826LA — the local branch of the nationwide nonprofit 826, which was created by novelist Dave Eggers in San Francisco with the mission of teaching both academic and creative writing to children — has integrated its diverse mix of students into the equally as diverse Los Angeles music scene with the upcoming compilation, Chickens in Love.
The tracks on Chickens in Love, 12 in total, were developed and written by children in 826LA’s very own workshop, Songwriting With the Submarines — led by the L.A.-based indie-pop duo John Dragonetti and Blake Hazard. Once the tracks were completed by such student bands as The Gummy Bears, Pig Power, The Taco Shells and Jennifer Lopez (the band, not Jenny-from-the-block), Los Angeles musicians She & Him, Dum Dum Girls, Crystal Antlers, Cold War Kids and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros covered the songs, forming the ultimate cross-town/age/cultural indie collaboration.
However, the love does not end at the full-length album. This 826LA fundraiser (all proceeds go to the organization so that it can maintain its free after-school tutoring and workshops) culminates in a one-day all-ages MINI Music Festival on March 6 at the Echoplex in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles. A completely L.A.-centric, D.I.Y. event, local favorites The Submarines, The Happy Hollows and The Growlers are among the performers scheduled for the day-long concert.
Chickens in Love is set to release in mid-April and will only be available for purchase at 826LA, Origami Vinyl, The Echo Park Time Travel Mart and the 826LA website. The album, as well as festival tickets, T-shirts and other merchandise, are currently available for pre-order online.

Tuesday marked the first violation filing of the USG campaign season.
Complaints were filed against presidential and vice presidential candidates Chris Cheng and Nehi Ogbevoen for using the USG listserv to e-mail students. All three other presidential tickets filed complaints.
The elections commission considered the complaints and ultimately found that there had been a violation but that it would not result in any kind of suspension or disqualification.
The commission ruled that Cheng and Ogbevoen violated the elections code by using the USG listserv but the commission did not view the e-mail as implying an endorsement because most recipients could not see that it was sent to the USG listserv. Had the commission decided that the e-mail implied an endorsement by USG stricter penalties could have been enacted.
Instead, Cheng and Ogbevoen faced only minor punishment, ordered to remove 10 signs from Trousdale for a two-hour period Wednesday morning.
The other candidates were not satisfied with this ruling and said they would bring the issue to the judicial board.

The Galen Center is pretty darn big as is.
Yet, it has always been missing something that could make it even more visible – a gigantic marquee.
Finally, after nearly three and a half years of operation, the home of USC volleyball and basketball will finally get a marquee to match its gigantic stature.
Construction on an 18-by-32 foot programmable LED signpost is already underway, as the scaffolding by the 110 freeway might give you a hint.
The marquee was part of the original building plans for the Galen Center, but the additional 2.3 million dollars that the sign cost was not available until now. The money was raised over a few years by the athletic department.
The sign will be used to display results, schedules, congratulatory messages and other messages one might expect a marquee to feature.
The sign will be named Tilley Tower after longtime USC donor Bill Tilley. Tilley is most well known among USC donors as having endowed the Traveler Mascot Program that helps ensure the upkeep of the school’s official mascot.
Tilley received both his undergraduate and graduate degree from USC, graduating magna cum laude in 1963 from Marshall School of Business with an MBA.

A day into the voting period, the question currently at the forefront of every Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidate’s mind is: who will win?
The candidates have spent the past week advertising their platforms and convincing students they are most qualified for the job. But when it comes down to it, students are likely to vote based on myriad other factors.
Decisions · Students submit their votes for USG office at a voting center outside the Lyon Center on Tuesday.  All voters were given free food. - Youli Zheng | Daily Trojan 
Ann Crigler, professor of political science, said voters consider things like a candidate’s appearance, whether or not the candidate has similar values to their own or if the candidate shares the same network of associations. Voters will often consider the issues, she said, but the other factors are often more important.
Some students said it was, in fact, personal connections that influenced their vote.
Justin Mercer, a junior majoring in environmental engineering, said he is voting for a particular ticket because he is friends with one of the candidates.
“I know [him] personally, so I’m going to vote for him,” Mercer said.
Mercer said he does not know the candidates’ platforms, but he is supporting the ticket because of his personal connection.
Ted Tao, a junior majoring in business administration, said he  has worked with the candidate he will vote for and is convinced he has the necessary qualities to lead USG.
“I realized that he is actually a very gifted individual in terms of listening and keeping up with the students’ perspectives and being able to really, truly understand what they need,” Tao said. “He’s very organized, very focused and very driven, and I just like the fact that he’s always smiling.”
Tao did not attend USG’s debate and admitted his vote is based largely on character. He added, though, that he thinks a lot of students don’t weigh platform points heavily when they vote.
Some students, however, have made a point of learning about the candidates’ stances on the issues.
“I didn’t really think I was going to be that interested but once [the candidates] presented some of the issues I really did get involved, and kind of did find out more, and want to get involved and wanted to learn more about the candidate and what they were presenting,” said Debbie Rumbo, a freshman majoring in political science and Spanish.
Ultimately, though, Rumbo said she will vote based on presentation rather than platform when it comes to specific issues.
“For me … it’s oratory — how they present themselves to the public [and] if they seem to want to incorporate what we think into their campaign,” she said.
According to Crigler, many vote for the people who are most like them. It is critical for candidates to have a community of supporters behind them, she said.
Traditionally the residential community has shown the highest number of voters compared to the Greek or commuter communities, according to Scott Hummel, co-director of elections and recruitment for USG and a junior majoring in communication.
“Last year was unique because we saw an increase in voting among the Greek community,” he added.
Hummel said he is confident that current USG President Holden Slusher’s involvement in Greek life was a big factor in his winning the USG presidency last spring.
Crigler said she was not surprised that many past winners have been Greek.
“Sororities and fraternities already have a strong base of support,” Crigler said. “It certainly helps get the message out more effectively.”
This year, the campaign period began Feb. 8 and candidates will continue to campaign throughout the voting period, ending Feb. 18, which only gives students 10 days to get to know the candidates.
“Ten days is the most reasonable time,” Hummel said. “It takes a lot of man power, money and resources to make sure we promote elections and allow candidates to promote themselves.”
USG remains neutral in providing information on candidate platforms. According to the election code, distributing information on the candidates and their platforms is the candidates’ duty. Placing this responsibility on the presidential hopefuls — some of whom currently hold positions within USG — saves USG from entering into potentially dangerous waters.
“We take the issue of being an unbiased organization seriously,” Hummel said. “We want to make sure we are not an exclusive, internally hiring organization.”
Presidential hopefuls in the running this year include Chris Cheng, USG’s director of external relations; Dylan Dann, a Greek senator; Andrew Matson, USG’s director of academic affairs; and Jonathan Munoz-Proulx.
Voting began Tuesday and will continue through Thursday. Students can vote online or at several locations on campus.

Most students have to go overseas for the chance to share a classroom with students from an international university, but a select group of USC students will have the opportunity to do so from Los Angeles.
A hand-selected class of 12 undergraduate students from USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering and Marshall School of Business are pioneers in a new, innovative approach to videoconferencing technology.
Using technology known as the i-Podium, the Principle and Practice of Global Innovation Teams class shares lectures with students from Peking University in Beijing on a biweekly basis.
“The ‘i’ in i-Podium stands for international, innovative, interactive, immersive, integrated, interchange, infusion and the combination of all the above,” said  Stephen Lu, a professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering and Viterbi’s David Packard endowed chair.
Lu, who is pioneering the pilot program, emphasized that the technology is not particularly innovative, but its use is groundbreaking.
“It’s not about the technology but the way they let us use it,” Lu said. “It speeds up the scale of delivery.”
This is the first year USC has partnered with PKU to offer this new strategy, branching off of the Distance Education Network. Lu lectures for his stand-in class at USC while a monitor projects the same lecture to his other classroom at PKU.
The PKU students are also projected onto a screen in Lu’s classroom. Lu is then able to lecture and teach his class while being able to answer the questions of all of the students, even the ones raising their hands in China.
The collaborating screens at both campuses enable the students to engage in group projects, discussions and communicate with absolute synchronization.
The students from USC and PKU discuss issues facing the respective campuses and compare problem-solving techniques. Right now, they are developing a case study focused on observing and improving campus life.
Students compare differences in the problems cultures face and collaborate to find solutions.
“We’re working case studies in order to improve the respective campuses by sharing ideas and identifying problems and providing solutions,” said Craig Western, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering and a student in Lu’s class.
Many students said the class helps provide global context.
Jin Oh, a sophomore majoring in business administration and a member of Lu’s class, said the interaction of the two groups of students can help to change “the way they view the world; looking at things differently they become innovative.”
The i-Podium is still in its initial stages but it could be expanded in the future.
Kelly Goulis, associate dean of Master’s and Professional Programs at Viterbi, said the program could branch out to other schools at USC if the pilot program is successful.
“If the experience is positive and enriching for students, there soon may be multiple courses to adapt a global curriculum,” she said.
Marshall and Viterbi will evaluate the success of this spring’s class in deciding whether or not to offer the class in the fall.
Many other departments have expressed interest in the program.
If successful, i-Podium could eventually extend to other universities across the nation.

Officers arrested nine drunk drivers and impounded 41 cars Saturday at the DUI checkpoint near campus.
Nine drivers under the influence were arrested at the checkpoint along Figueroa Street between Jefferson Boulevard and 32nd Street on Saturday night.
Los Angeles Police Department, California Highway Patrol and USC Department of Public Safety officers screened 1,206 cars between 7 p.m. and 1 a.m., officers said.
Of those cars, 41 were impounded for drivers driving without a license, and one driver was arrested for possession of a knife, along with the nine arrested for driving under the influence.  
No USC students were involved in any of the arrests or impoundings.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle expressed concern about the number of people driving without a license who are possibly driving without insurance as well.
Carlisle also said the checkpoint was an important way of keeping the streets safe.
“Those people were removed from the roadway before they injured someone,” Carlisle said.
Roland Gallardo, an LAPD officer who worked at the DUI checkpoint, said he believed this checkpoint was a critical safeguard in the university area.
“Of those drivers, one out of the nine or maybe more could be a potential subject that could have run over one of our students on the street or on a bike,” Gallardo said. “So I think because we got that many off the street, we were successful.”
Right but the Row pays a lot of money.. not going to get into a lot of trouble anytime soon. It’s interesting that this Ronald Gallardo guy is saying how they helped prevent people from running over bikes… has there been any issue lately other than what happened around the Jefferson and Hoover St? And wasn’t that at 3am?
curious as to why they don’t patrol “The Row” and why they stopped at 32nd streets when clearly there are drunk students among others north of 32nd street.  If LAPD, CHP, and DPS went to The Row, then they would include a different (but not suprising) demographic of USC students who are drunk drivers and/or underaged & intoxicated.

Census officials are making a push for USC students to participate in the upcoming 2010 census, but students still don’t know how or why they should get involved with it.
Stand up and be counted · The census bus came to Trousdale Parkway on Friday to educate students about the census and why it is important that they participate. - Scott Fairbanks | Daily Trojan 
The U.S. Census Bureau launched the 2010 Census Portrait of America Road Tour in early January by sending 13 vehicles across the United States to educate residents about the census and explain why their participation is important.
“The populace in general is not aware, or could be made more aware,” said Bernard Pendergrass, a media specialist at the Los Angeles Regional Census Center. “We’re trying to spread the word everywhere we go.”
Over the last 10 years, Los Angeles has lost more than $200 million of federal funding because an estimated 78,000 L.A. residents went uncounted after not filling out the 2000 census, according to the Los Angeles City Census Office.
“This census determines how many seats in Congress each state is allocated, how federal money is allocated,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “It’s a once-a-decade chance to take a snapshot of who we are.”
To help spread the word, the census bus visited USC on Friday to educate students about the census and to shatter the misconception that they will be counted at home.
Census officials specifically targeted USC because of the high international student population, which generally does not participate in the census, said Kerstyn Olson, deputy director of the Unruh Institute, which sponsored the census bus visit.
Many international students do not know that they can participate in the census.
“I really did not know,” said Beroze DuBash, a sophomore majoring in communication and an international student. “I thought it was an American thing.”
Olsen and census officials said it is important for every student to participate in the census to help bring resources to the city and school.
Some students said the school or census officials should take a more proactive approach in informing students.
“They should send out an e-mail,” said Sahil Khandwala, an international student and a sophomore majoring in business administration, “because no one knows about it.”
Census officials said this lack of awareness is precisely what they’re trying to combat.
“Some people are unaware, and that’s why we’re doing everything we can so when they get it in the mail, they know what it is and what it’s used for,” said Jazmin Ortega, media specialist at the Los Angeles City Census Office.
Students in general have also been historically underrepresented. Census data  provides the government information about the population that can affect the allocation of money, including funding given to schools and universities.
“People don’t realize that the minute you get up every day from the minute you go to bed every day is impacting the census,” said Sandra Alvarado, Census Bureau media specialist. “You took a shower, and, at one point, someone said they needed water here,” said Alvarado, and that is just one example of how the census can impact everyday life.
Olson said she thought the census bus had a good turnout, but many students said they did not see it or only stopped by for the free tote bags and water bottles. Many students remain unaware of the need to participate in the census.
“What’s the point of knowing or not knowing?” asked Raghu Nallamothhu, a graduate student studying computer science from India who had never heard of the census before visiting the bus on campus for free census gear.
The census bus might return to campus later, on a day when more students are on campus, Olson said.
In April, the Census Bureau mails census forms and envelopes to citizens. Students can participate in the census by filling out these 10-question forms.
The administration presumably knows how many students are enrolled. Why isn’t using that number good enough?

The student group Campus and Community United has compiled a report card on some of the Undergraduate Student Government candidates to help student voters evaluate their platforms, though some candidates have taken issue with the grades.
That’s the ticket · Janice Kim, a sophomore majoring in communication, casts her vote for Undergraduate Student Government president, vice president and senate. Voting began Tuesday and continues until Thursday. - Youli Zheng | Daily Trojan 
The report cards of all the presidential candidates and nine of the 15 senatorial candidates were posted along with explanations on the Campus and Community United Facebook page before voting started Tuesday, according to Jonathan Truong, the CCU’s coalition coordinator.
The report card grades the candidates in four areas: commitment to the Master Plan Student Voice Committee, affordable student housing, sustainability and their proposed relationship with the neighborhood.
Presidential candidates were graded based on interviews with Nicholas Brown, CCU’s administrative coordinator. Senatorial candidates’ grades were based on their responses to a CCU survey. Not all the senatorial candidates responded.
Brown said the interviews were useful both in gathering information and in explaining CCU’s agenda to potential USG leaders.
“Now we have this connection with these people who are going to be in charge of the student side of running USC,” Brown said. “Now they know our goals and they’ve been completely onboard.”
CCU hopes the report card will also educate voters on what the group thinks are important issues.
“The survey sparks more interest in the issues,” Truong said. “That’s primarily how we want to change voters minds.”
In his evaluations of the presidential candidates, Brown said he was looking for enthusiasm and passion in addition to interests that agreed with those of the CCU.
Presidential candidates’ grades ranged from B+ to A.
“Everyone has pretty great scores,” Truong said. “It’s a good sign because it shows how capable all of the candidates are.”
Some candidates, however, disagreed with how they were graded.
“CCU is free to grade however they want,” said Andrew Matson, a presidential candidate whose ticket received a B+ overall. “I’ll disagree with the grade though. I think my plans to improve community relations are strong, and some of the descriptions of the candidates might be inaccurate or possibly even unfair.”
Matson said he was concerned because there seemed to be no transparency in the grading system. He was quick to note, however, that he still agrees with CCU’s goals, even if he disagrees with its grades.
Candidates who fared better had different opinions, however.
Jonathan Munoz-Proulx, a presidential candidate whose ticket received an A-, said he thought the grading criteria were just.
“I just quickly looked it over, but I think it was very fair,” he said. “I was thrilled to see that everyone had done very well in the grading process.”
CCU is particularly concerned about the long-term implications of the Master Plan, Brown said, and candidates who had not considered long-term effects tended to score lower on the report card. He added that he hopes the survey and interviews put the ideas into the candidates’ heads and that he wants whoever is elected to advocate for student input.
“It’s a $400-million plan,” Brown said. “We want students to have some say in what’s going on.”
CCU had originally decided to grade the candidates so that the group could choose one to back. After interviewing a number of the presidential and senatorial candidates, however, the group changed its mind.
“We’re not endorsing a single candidate,” Brown said. “[The candidates] are all passionate about the same things, and they’re qualified.”
Instead, Brown said that the report highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each of the candidates.
Some students said they will look at the report card before they cast their vote.
Ben Siskin, an undeclared sophomore, said he is interested in CCU’s analysis.
“I’m the type of person who’s influenced a lot by outside information,” he said. “I like to see what other people think.”
Others, however, said outside input does not mean much.
“If I know the person personally, I’ll vote for them,” said Yoni Moore, an undeclared freshman. “That has a bigger impact than what someone else says.”
CCU hopes the 700 members of the CCU’s Facebook group will take the report cards into consideration.
“There’s always concerns that elections like this are sort of a popularity contest,” said Daniel Wu, CCU’s faculty and projects coordinator. “But I really feel like USG can make a huge impact on partnerships and community development with this. We make sure the candidates have a real commitments toward USG.”
Community safety and interests are rarely, if ever a concern for students and USC officials.  As a long time resident of the area as well as a recent USC graduate I have found myself asking many of the same questions about safety, resources and the gentrification of my beloved neighborhood that CCU has been bringing up.  It is great to see an organization come together around the idea of involving the folks that are most affected by policies and “Master Plans” in low income neighborhoods such as USC.
Young people growing up and going to school around this area have seen and gone through things most USC students could never imagine.  Drugs, abuse, fights, killings, police brutality and racial profiling, along with  inadequate social resources (education, healthcare, affordable and healthy housing, jobs,…) and many other issues have plagued my community for a long time.  There are many great organizations helping to meet the needs of my community that should not be ignored in this process simply because USC cannot take the credit for their progress.
But now USC has a master plan (I contend it is a plan to force the community out) and wants to invest heavily in $400 million into the area north of campus, doubling the size of it’s campus.  Looks like more places people from my community will feel is off limits to them, despite the campus being a so called public space.
Thanks for all the great programs USC (I myself being from the NAI) but please do not allow my community to die for the small benefit of richer college kids and their need for a few more bars and chain restaurants.
thank you

* CCU advocates for increased opportunity in the neighborhood. We recognize the linked fate between the campus and the community and the current unequal landscape of opportunity that exists in the city, whether seen in terms of inequitable job, transit, or educational opportunities.
* Now is a key time to get involved. The election of an urban president, the creation of the office of Urban affairs, and USC’s Master Plan all point to a renewed focus on our cities. We, as students and faculty on campus, with local community leaders and residents, seek to take responsibility for our neighborhood.
* CCU seeks movement toward proven metropolitan strategies. We urge the implementation of environmentally sustainable and innovative metropolitan strategies shown to promote economic mobility, freedom, and improved public health. These strategies encourage individual and social responsibility to strengthen our communities and cities for the future. 
Together, we can achieve national leadership to bring community partnerships to a new level and democratically and sustainably promote opportunity for all.

It’s not time to panic, yet.
When the final kill hit the hardwood on USC’s side of the net, the Trojans stood as still as Michelangelo’s David, frozen in a state of disbelief before finally, mechanically, shaking hands with the opponent.
Down · Junior Austin Zahn and the Trojans have lost three of four. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
The No. 2 USC men’s volleyball team couldn’t believe they had just been swept by No. 7 Pepperdine at home Friday night (30-28, 30-28, 30-26) for their third loss in four games. Two of those losses have come at the hands of the Waves (5-4, 5-3), who dethroned the former No. 1 Trojans (7-4, 5-3) in a five-set thriller two weeks ago in Malibu, Calif.
This time, the Waves only needed three sets to put a dent at the start of the Trojans’ seven-game homestand and plant a seed of doubt in the back of the team’s mind.
“I think coach said it well that it’s not panic time, but it’s concerned time,” said Tony Ciarelli, sophomore outside hitter. “We should all be a little concerned right now. We should be playing better than this.”
USC had a chance to close out the third set and extend the match, but, much like the previous two sets, the Trojans got stuck in a rotation and it hurt them. With USC up 20-18, Pepperdine called a timeout, then proceeded to go on a deadly 10-2 run to put the match away.
The same thing happened in the second set. The Trojans took a 12-11 lead, only to watch as the Waves went on a 6-0 run. Once the Trojans were able to get out of their rotation, they clawed their way back to tie the game at 28. But they couldn’t put it away.
“It wasn’t like throughout the game we were playing terrible,” Ciarelli said. “We weren’t playing bad for 90 percent of the game but that 10 percent just took out that other 90. It was that one rotation that was killing us.”
Other than getting stuck in one rotation, USC had trouble passing and building onto a lead. USC’s biggest lead was four points — 16-12 in the first set — and every time the Trojans looked like they were ready to pull away they made a mistake and the Waves reeled them back in.
USC was never able to pull away because of the predictability of passes. Opposite hitter Murphy Troy and Ciarelli had 71 combined attempts — more than double the rest of the team. They put away only 29 of those attempts while middle blockers Austin Zahn and Hunter Current killed 19 balls on 31 attempts. If the Trojans could’ve gotten Zahn and Current the ball more, the match might have turned out differently.
“We’re not passing the ball as well as we can so we’re not getting opportunities to set them,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “The passing was huge and did us in tonight and made our offense two-dimensional instead of three.”
Despite this, Ferguson said panic time hasn’t arrived yet. He points to the late start in the fall — Troy, Ciarelli and outside hitter Tri Bourne played on the USA Junior National team at the world championships in August and Current was injured. As well as, the weekly Wednesday/Friday matches they had earlier this season, giving USC only one real day of practice.
So, it’s back to the gym for the Trojans, where all they can do is continue to work to end their midseason funk.
“We go back to the practice gym and video room and keep getting better,” Ferguson said. “This is only the second week we’ve had to train since late December, so we are finally able to get back to the drawing board, and anytime we get to train right now is going to be huge for us.”
Murphy Troy needs to be put back in the serve receiving rotation and put Maddison Mckibbin on the right side.  He is a lefty and could become even better than Carson Clark there.
This team is getting worse as the season is progressing.  Ferguson CANNOT coach.  Other teams are getting stronger and USC is falling behind.  Watching this USC team is frustrating because it’s loaded with talent but it cannot be fully realized with Bill Ferguson as the coach.  
Murphy Troy is playing out of position.  He is not a right side hitter. He’s not a natural there. It’s so obvious.  The offense is too slow compared to most teams out there.  If they run a faster offense ala UC irvine they will  be a lot more efficient but Ferguson is too dumb to see it.  Tony Ciarelli is a complete goofball.  His behavior on the court is tottaly unacceptable but his dad is a volunteer coach so he gets away with it.  Tri Bourne is just terrible.  He should be benched in favor of the far more talented Maddison Mckibbin.  Austin Zahn is the best hitting middle in the country but the predicatble nature of the USC offense is slowing him down.  Otherwise he would easily hit over .550  Don’t even get me started on the Libero position.  I didn’t think Luke Morris would be missed but his two replacements are a joke.  They can’t recieve serve better then high school kids.  Brad Keenen would have probably done a much better job but he quit or got hurt.
The best solution is to wait until the 2012 olympics are over and go after Alan knipe or Hugh McCutcheon.  Both them will want to coach in the college game after the 2012 games are over and hopefully USC will go after one of them. Both them have forgotten more about volleyball then Ferguson will ever know.
Looks like the same team as last year where the regular season was just above average until the conference tournament when they got hot to carry them to the final four. Hurting in the libero position right now missing Luke Morris senior leadership. People like Sean Dennis, Steven Shandrick, and Molchewski (sp) not getting any playing time after being given high accolades when recruited. Sometimes a change is needed when things are not working as planned even just to shake up the establishment for awhile.

“UCLA kicked our butts,” USC head coach Michael Cooper said.
That statement pretty much summed up the game for the Women of Troy (13-10, 7-5) as they lost their fourth consecutive game, 74-56, to the UCLA Bruins (16-7, 9-3) Saturday afternoon at Pauley Pavilion.
Reserves · Freshman forward Christina Marinacci contributed eight points off the bench for the Women of Troy in their loss to the Bruins. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“We didn’t handle their traps well, we didn’t move the ball, and we didn’t look to attack,” Cooper said.
The Bruins came out aggressive and firing on all cylinders, jumping out to an early 10-point lead.
Meanwhile, the Women of Troy looked confused on offense, committing 14 first-half turnovers.
“I thought we were apprehensive on the offensive side. We dug ourselves in a hole, and it’s always difficult to come out of that, especially with the intenseness of this rivalry,” Cooper said.
Not only did the Women of Troy struggle to find any rhythm on offense, but rebounding the basketball was also a problem as the Bruins grabbed 12 offensive rebounds during the first half.
“Rebounding has been our Achilles’ heel all season long,” Cooper said. “You’re not going to win very many games getting out-rebounded.”
The Bruins stifling defense, coupled with the Women of Troy’s offensive woes, allowed the Bruins to stretch that early 10-point lead to 19 points going into halftime.
To start the second half, the Women of Troy went on a 6-0 run, cutting the deficit to 37-24, but the little hope that was there was quickly gone in a flash as the Bruins reeled off eight consecutive points of their own to push the lead to 21 points.
And from that point on, the Women of Troy couldn’t muster much else.
“I was very pleased with our defensive effort, and each player brought something to the game,” UCLA coach Nikki Caldwell said.
Not only did the Bruins have a solid defensive game, but they also had a balanced offensive attack that saw four players score in double figures.
The Women of Troy were led by junior center Kari LaPlante and sophomore guard Ashley Corral, who both scored 11 points.
One bright spot for the Women of Troy was the play of redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos, who scored 11 points off the bench in just her third game back from numerous knee injuries that had plagued her the previous couple of years.
“I’m definitely rusty, and I’m trying to get a feel back for the game and let it come to me,” Gemelos said. “I’m not trying to take over a game or anything, but I’m just trying to play solid and give us the best chance to win.”
The Women of Troy return home to the Galen Center for the next two games, starting Thursday against Washington State and then Saturday against Washington.

From the casual fan’s standpoint, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team did just about everything right in its 9-2 win over No. 7 Loyola Marymount Saturday afternoon at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Dominating · Freshman two-meter Patricia Jancso and the USC women’s water polo team captured a 9-2 victory over Loyola Marymount. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
Facing a top 10-ranked opponent in LMU, the Women of Troy scored seven consecutive goals to defeat the Lions who were coming off a UC San Diego Triton Invitational title.
Leading USC in its offensive onslaught were junior driver Joelle Bekhazi and sophomore driver Nadia Dan, who scored two goals apiece. Additionally, the Women of Troy held the LMU offense, which was averaging 14.25 goals entering the contest, to just two goals and then shut them out in the second half.
Despite what appeared to be an impressive victory over a top-10 foe, USC was not entirely pleased with its performance.
“We have a lot to work on,” Dan said. “We missed a lot of opportunities. We have a long way to go from where we can be with all the talent we have. We have everything here; we just have to work hard and focus.”
The discouraging remarks stem from the fact that USC got off to a rough start early on in the contest. The Women of Troy, who were just coming off a 13-goal scoring barrage against UCLA last weekend, failed to score once in the first nine minutes of the game after several inopportune shots.
“We didn’t come out with the right mind-set,” Dan continued. “We just missed a lot of opportunities. We had a really good gameplan. We knew the goalie’s weakness, we just didn’t execute. We didn’t execute our center plays or our six-on-fives either.”
As a result of the Women of Troy’s struggles, the Lions were able to get on the scoreboard early and go up by a score of 1-0, causing even more frustration on the USC side.
“Our defense sucked today,” said USC head coach Jovan Vavic. “We don’t talk. We don’t communicate. We don’t make switches. I don’t even know how many times we got ejected. You get ejected because you’re out of position. Our defense was just terrible.”
Yet as the game wore on, USC’s depth became too much to overcome for LMU. With the game tied at two goals apiece midway through the second quarter, a goal by Bekhazi broke the tie to put the Women of Troy in the driver’s seat with a one-goal lead heading into halftime.
In the second half, USC piled it on, scoring six goals and turning a once competitive matchup into a near-blowout. Each goal was scored by a different player, highlighting the team’s offensive balance.
Nonetheless, Vavic and the rest of the team were quick to deflect any praise.
“LMU simply got tired,” the 15th-year head coach said. “We created quite a few opportunities in the counter attack by getting open for some easy fast break opportunities. That made a difference.”

An up-and-down weekend for the USC women’s tennis team at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships finished on a sour note Sunday, as the Women of Troy (6-2) suffered their worst loss of the season to No. 5 Baylor, 5-2.
Baylor opened the match by capturing the doubles point rather easily, as the Bears’ pair of seniors Lenka Brosova and Csilla Borsanyi quickly defeated the USC junior duo of Maria Sanchez and Lyndsay Kinstler 8-4 at the first doubles pairing, followed by the Bears’ 8-5 victory at the third doubles slot.
Sophomore Alison Ramos had better luck at the second singles slot, capturing a hard-fought 7-5, 7-6 victory from Borsanyi, which evened the singles score after the fifth singles match had gone the Bears’ way earlier in the dual meet.
Brosova took on Sanchez again in the first singles slot, with the first set going Sanchez’s way 6-2. However, Brosova made a turnaround, and captured the second set 6-4 and finishing Sanchez off with a commanding 6-1 third set victory, which would prove to clinch the victory for the Bears. Brosova would finish the championships undefeated at the top singles slot.
A victory by junior Cristala Andrews turned out to be too little too late at the sixth singles slot, although Andrews’ 6-1, 6-0 victory gave the junior an undefeated run at the Indoor Championships.
The Women of Troy started the ITAs against No. 14 Clemson on Friday, in a match that turned out to be among the longest of the championships.
Freshman Danielle Lao and Ramos opened the match with a easy doubles victory, but the rest of the doubles matches proved long and hard-fought.
The pair of Sanchez and
Kinstler captured a tough 8-6 victory, clinching the doubles point for the Women of Troy, but the Trojans were unable to sweep the doubles in the middle of a three-set epic with Duke sophomore No. 91 Ellah Nze when the match was stopped after the Blue Devils had already clinched the victory. Andrews and Pulido also had their doubles match stopped once the doubles point had been clinched, but were up 8-7 when play was stopped.
The Women of Troy won’t play again until Feb. 23 at San Diego State, but will take the next few days to regroup from the long weekend.

A weekend that included its first loss did not equate to a lost weekend for the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team.
The Trojans (8-1, 0-0) played three matches­ — winning two and losing one — this past weekend at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in snowy Charlottesville, Va.
Although USC began the tournament as the top seed and favorite to win, the trip did not conclude as expected.
“[The tournament] was somewhat of a disappointment,” junior Jaak Poldma said. “Being the No. 1 seed, we were hoping to win the tournament.”
Even though the end result was undesirable, the opportunity to play the nation’s top squads proved to be an invaluable experience as the team prepares for its first true away matches of the season.
USC opened play against No. 16 Fresno State (7-4) and notched a 4-0 sweep of the Bulldogs.
The Trojans again displayed their depth as sophomore Steve Johnson did not participate in the first-round match because of a nagging back injury.
Senior Jason McNaughton provided a big boost as he teamed up with senior Robert Farah to win their doubles match 8-3.
In the tournament’s second round, USC suffered its first loss of the season to No. 8 Texas (6-1) 4-2.
In another first this season, the Trojans surrendered the doubles point. The top two pairings of No. 13 Farah/Johnson and sophomore Daniel Nguyen/McNaughton were uncharacteristically blown out­ 1-8 and 2-8, respectively.
During singles, USC seemed to have turned things around with four of the six Trojans winning the first sets of their matches, but in the end they fell short in their comeback bid against the Longhorns. The loss set up a match against rival No. 3 UCLA (3-2) in the consolation round.
In their 4-0 sweep of the Bruins, the Trojans were able to finish the tournament on a positive note and overcome the sting of the season’s first loss.
In the tightly contested doubles portion, Poldma and junior Peter Lucassen upset the No. 36 duo of seniors Matt Brooklyn and Kallim Stewart 8-6, and Nguyen and freshman J.T. Sundling locked up the match’s initial point, winning in a tiebreak 9-8 (7-4).
The Trojans put forth a strong effort in singles ­— losing only one set — to finish off their crosstown rivals.
This marked the first win over the Bruins since 2007, giving the younger players their first taste of victory in this intense rivalry.
“It’s big to get over the hump, especially beating [UCLA] the way that we did and after coming off the loss to Texas,” Johnson said.
USC did arrive home to some individual accolades, as Poldma was named a USC Credit Union Student-Athlete of the Week for his strong performance at the Indoor Championships.
Poldma was undefeated, contributing two singles and two doubles victories.
As the Trojans head into the heart of the season, however, injuries remain a concern.
Johnson has been dealing with his injury since the beginning of the season, and USC coach Peter Smith attributed Johnson’s ailment to some of the difficulties the team endured, especially in doubles.
“We had no consistency with our No. 2 and No. 1 doubles throughout the weekend and a lot of that had to do with Steve Johnson and his back acting up,” Smith said.
The Trojans will take the lessons from this tournament and build upon them as they continue to focus on their ultimate goal.
“It was good to take us out of our natural element and give us some adversity,” Smith said. “It was great to see all the other teams and know what we have to do to win the NCAA title.”

The USC women’s swimming and diving team swam circles around crosstown rival UCLA Saturday afternoon, outclassing the Bruins in Westwood for the third consecutive year, 164.5-135.5.
Dominating · Freshman distance swimmer Haley Anderson and the Women of Troy handily beat UCLA on Saturday. Anderson captured the 1650-yard freestyle in 16:17.81, nearly eight seconds faster than the field. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The Women of Troy (11-2, 4-2) improved to 20-16 all-time against UCLA and finished their regular season ranked ninth in the nation. UCLA fell to 5-4 overall, 2-4 in the Pac-10, going belly-up in its last three dual meets of the year.
The emotion of the rivalry meet made for some of the best swimming of the season ­— the last for four USC seniors. The teams combined to set nine Spieker Aquatics Center records and 48 season-best times.
“Everyone brings their best to the UCLA meet,” said USC head coach Dave Salo. “That’s what makes it so much fun.”
Juniors Presley Bard and Lyndsay DePaul, sophomore Ania Kowalczyk and freshman Christel Simms set the tone early, opening with a season-best and pool-record 1:40.08 in the 200-yard medley relay. DePaul, Bard and freshman Haley Anderson all finished the day with two first-place finishes apiece to lead the Trojans.
Anderson earned her first win of the meet in the 1650-yard freestyle with a pace of 16:17.81, nearly eight seconds ahead of UCLA’S Samantha Vanden Berge. DePaul followed the performance with a 1:46.92 time in the 200-yard free, another first-place effort and a Spieker Aquatics Center record. Freshman Kate Shumway and senior Krissy Forelli added four points with third- and fifth-place finishes, respectively.
In the last dual meet of her career, senior co-captain Dina Hegazy swam a season best 54.72 in the 100-yard backstroke to take second place for the Trojans. Hegazy finished only behind Bard, who claimed her second pool record at 53.86.
Several freshmen made a splash in the final count as well, from both the platforms and the springboard. Jordan Danny improved her season-best by nearly three seconds with a second-place effort in the 100-yard breaststroke. Her third-place 2:13.18 swim in the 200-yard breaststroke was more than four seconds faster than her previous record. Freshman Ariel Rittenhouse had another big day on the 1-meter springboard, edging sophomore teammate Victoria Ishimatsu 301.13 to 299.78.
UCLA took the final event of the day, winning the 400-yard free relay consolation prize in 3:23.86. The Bruins’ time was enough to out-swim water, as USC was disqualified from the event.
The win will earn USC five important points toward the Crosstown Gauntlet, a trophy awarded annually to the university who wins the most head-to-head athletic matchups over the other. The Trojans currently hold a 35-25 lead in this year’s contest.
The Trojans start postseason competition Feb. 24 at the 2010 Pac-10 championships in Long Beach, Calif. The NCAA championships begin March 18 at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.

I know it. You know it. We all know it.
When it comes to sporting events, February is about as exciting as the alligator exhibit at the Los Angeles Zoo. Other than the occasional devouring of children, it is monotonous and bland, offering spurts of curiosity only to tease us and revert back to its dreary, clock-watching ways.
Sure, when you first glance at the calendar for the month, you think you can get through it easier than a triple-scoop ice cream sundae. There’s Bill Murray Day — otherwise known as Groundhog Day. There’s the Super Bowl, which is watched more for the commercials than the game. Then there’s the NBA All-Star game, which is one of the few events where the days leading up to it outshine the day itself .
Yet these are just three days of sunshine in a month when most of the country is buried under four feet of snow. (Speaking of which, where did Maryland go?)
Well, fear not sports fans, something has come to save us this year. Is it Ted Williams? Nationwide health care? Bruce Willis?
No, it’s the Winter Olympics.
Now, many people think of the winter games as the annoying little cousin that won’t leave you alone at family reunions. There aren’t as many sports as the summer games and just about all of them were invented in some place other than than the United States.
Another common complaint is that nobody knows who they are watching. That downhill skier looks exactly like the dude who just went, except he has on a different jacket. For all the viewers know, he could’ve gotten to the bottom, changed jackets on a lift to the top and skied down again.
And contrary to what Subway might have you believe, Michael Phelps is not competing in these games. Very few household names are. Other than Carrot Top’s brother Shaun White, that girl who tried to do a trick at the end of her snowboarding run last Olympics fell and lost the gold medal, the hot snowboarder named Lindsay Vonn who was in Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue recently and that hockey player who beat up a cab driver in Buffalo over 20 cents, very few faces (and bodies) are recognizable on TV.
However, the Winter Olympics is the best thing to happen to sports aficionados in February since … well, since the last Winter Olympics.
Face it, beggars can’t be choosers. Would you rather watch a fan coach the Nets (yes, it’s gotten that bad), the UConn women’s basketball team (whose only chance of losing plays out in the movie Armageddon) or skiers crash into the side netting at 120 mph? I thought so.
This is not meant to be disrespectful to Nodar Kumaritashvili, the Georgian luger who died during a training run Friday after he lost control of his sled and hit a steel pole. Nobody wishes for that to happen, and it’s one of the saddest moments in sports in recent history.
Yet as much as I hate to admit it, that accident is another reason to watch these games. There’s no doubt spectators love the thrill of high adrenaline sports. Nobody watches NASCAR to see if Jeff Gordon will ever age. It’s the 200 mph, jaw-dropping, metal-crunching, car-flipping, fire-blazing crashes that keep people entertained. Don’t think so? Just ask Michael Bay.
Despite Kumaritashvili’s tragic accident, the athletes race down the track at deathly speeds, literally. The luge is worth watching solely for that incredible display of courage.
There’s also the snowboarding halfpipe, an event which has taken out two of the top five competitors in recent months. White almost had his head knocked off in February after nailing his neck on the lip of the tube, but amazingly he got up and won the event. With almost every move becoming a thing of the past, boarders are coming up with tricks that can only be done by mashing the buttons on the Nintendo 64 game 1080 in a bid to out-do one another.
That competitive spirit is always on display in short-track speedskating. Who could forget eight years ago, when American Apollo Anton Ono took the last turn toward gold, only to crash with three other competitors, leaving the Australian Steven Bradbury as the Olympic champion simply because he was so far back that he wasn’t involved in the fray?
These aren’t events you see everyday, and that’s precisely why the Winter Olympics is so intriguing.
So don’t watch an NBA game for the 60th time this season — instead flip on hockey, a sport which has grown in the United States during the past couple of years. But the story isn’t the American team, it’s Canada’s. The favored Canadian men’s team has so much pressure on it to win gold — something it’s only done once since 1956 — that, if it doesn’t, the nation might explode.
Now that would be worth watching.

It wasn’t pretty. But then again, rivalry games rarely are.
The USC men’s basketball team lost the rebounding battle by double digits, made just 63 percent of its free throws and nearly coughed up a late lead, but in the end the Trojans (15-9, 7-5) did just enough to come away with a 68-64 win against UCLA on Sunday night at the Galen Center.
Opportunity seized · Given more playing time against UCLA, junior guard Donte Smith took full advantage, scoring 12 key points down the stretch against the Bruins. Smith shot 2 for 4 from 3-point range and better than 50 percent from the field. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The victory marked the first time since 2004 that USC has won both regular season meetings with the Bruins.
“I’ll remember this for a while,” senior guard Dwight Lewis said. “To be able to beat them here and get the season sweep on them is great.”
With 2:18 left to play and the Trojans leading 56-52, senior forward Marcus Johnson stole the ball from UCLA’s Jerime Anderson and raced downcourt for a two-handed dunk, bringing the crowd of 8,836 to its feet. USC held on from there, going 8 of 10 from the free throw line in the last two minutes to secure the victory — the Trojans’ first ever over UCLA (11-13, 6-6) at the Galen Center — and move into sole possession of third place in the Pac-10.
“The whole game we had with them the first time, that was an aberration,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said, referring to a 67-46 blowout of the Bruins in Westwood on Jan. 16. “We said it was going to be down to the wire, and it was.”
In his final game against UCLA, Lewis led all scorers with 23 points on 8 of 13 shooting. Redshirt junior guard Donte Smith came off the bench to hit several key shots, tying a career-high with 12 points and providing the boost USC needed after falling behind early in the second half.
“That’s my role,” Smith said. “Just bring high energy off the bench, play lockdown defense, make big plays for us.”
Energy was clearly lacking for much of the game, as the Trojans were thoroughly outrebounded, 46-25. Focus also proved to be an issue, with USC committing four straight turnovers after taking a 56-47 lead with 6:16 left. Then there were the two fouls on Bruin 3-point attempts in the final minute of the game.
“If you’re going down the stretch and you had a list of things you didn’t want to do, we did them all,” O’Neill said.
But while the Trojans seemingly tried their best to give the game away, UCLA continuously failed to take advantage. The Bruins shot 39 percent from the field and turned the ball over 20 times. Guards Michael Roll and Malcolm Lee combined for 34 points in the losing effort.
Despite enduring a three-minute scoreless stretch, USC led by as many as eight points in the first half and, after a Lewis lay-up and Johnson jumper, went into the locker room with a 32-29 lead.
The Bruins jumped in front five minutes into the second half when Lee drained a 3-pointer to make it 38-35. But sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic grabbed a key rebound and senior guard Mike Gerrity was fouled on a driving layup and drained the ensuing free throw to tie the score, sparking a 21-9 run that gave the Trojans the lead for good.
“We played through some bad stretches,” O’Neill said. “I’m very proud of our team. I thought they gave a great, great effort in the second half to beat a team that was playing very well.”
That team also happened to be a bitter crosstown rival, which explains why the victory, as sloppy as it was, wasn’t just any victory.
“It was fun, it was fun,” Lewis said, smiling. “The student section was going crazy. Gotta love it, gotta love a rivalry game.”
