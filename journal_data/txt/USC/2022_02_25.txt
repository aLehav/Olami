A study conducted by USC researchers discovered that, despite high antibody rates in the population, Los Angeles County saw coronavirus surges due to the delta and omicron variants, suggesting that herd immunity is unlikely in the area.
If a large enough portion of the population in a given area develops immunity to a disease, the spread of it will decrease and the area would achieve herd immunity. However, despite the high levels of coronavirus protection, via previous infection or vaccination, L.A. County still underwent periods of mass infection since April 2021.
“Despite the fact that such a high fraction of the population had COVID antibodies, we experienced a surge in infections,” Director of the COVID Initiative at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics Dr. Neeraj Sood said. “It’s unlikely this disease is going away. It’s more likely that it is just going to be an endemic disease and it is going to stay with us.”
The study — a Los Angeles pandemics surveillance cohort study published Jan. 20 in JAMA Network Open — is part of a larger project by the COVID-19 Pandemic Research Center at USC. 
Given findings from the studies, it’s important for schools and universities where the proportion of vaccinated individuals is high, such as USC, to continue being mindful and cognizant of the policies it keeps in place, or chooses to implement, moving forward. Dr. Olivier Pernet, one of the co-authors of the study, said there is no “one size fits all” solution.
“USC is massively vaccinated … which makes it extremely difficult for the virus to just spread, but we all know people who got infected despite being vaccinated,” Pernet said. “You cannot have your policies just focusing on only one aspect. You still need to have all the systems [such as wearing masks and social distancing] to prevent spread.”
The study initiative was motivated by the results of an April 2020 study that showed that actual infection numbers in L.A. County were higher than its reported cases.
“We’ve been trying to repeat that study to just understand how many people in the population have some protection from COVID, either because they were infected with COVID in the past or now because they have vaccinations,” Sood said.
The researchers discovered that in April 2021, one year after the original CPRC, around 72% of adults in L.A. County were vaccinated or had receptor binding domain antibodies for the coronavirus from prior infection. Nearly all unvaccinated participants infected with the coronavirus in the past still had receptor binding domain antibodies. 
The study also found that the coronavirus-related death rate per 100,000 individuals is four times higher in low-income areas compared to high-income areas. The same pattern shows in the presence of coronavirus antibodies in unvaccinated individuals — many more people in low-income areas of L.A. have coronavirus antibodies, compared to high-income areas among the unvaccinated, Sood said.
“We know that no certain population actually has yet achieved a high enough level of vaccination, and so that is why we want to focus on this minority population to help them to be able to protect better against COVID infections,” said Dr. Chun Nok Lam, one of the co-authors of the study. 
Other co-authors of the story include Howard Hu, Angela Klipp, Rani Kotha and Andrea Kovacs.
“In April, we were kind of thinking: ‘If we do something now, we just have to do it for a few months and then the pandemic will be over,’” Sood said. “Now, we’ve got to think: ‘Whatever we do, we will be doing that for a long time, and so does it make sense to implement that policy or not?’”

Colorful yard signs litter the bright green grass on the Trousdale median, marking the start of the Undergraduate Student Government election season. Yet, this is only one of the many ways that candidates have taken up campaigning, with many using digital platforms such as Instagram, shouting through bullhorns and tabling stands to answer questions from passersby.
Aidan Feighery, one of this year’s senatorial candidates, said that adapting to the student population’s online presence would be key to running a successful campaign. 
“I think that the pandemic encouraged us to engage online, and I think that the remnants of that are still here,” Feighery said. “There’s still some degree of ‘Stay inside and reduce outdoor interactions’ that I think has really resonated throughout campus.”
From social media to in-person campaigning, candidates used varying methods to reach different parts of the students body. Senatorial candidates Devin Ayala and Navya Singh said that they reached out to approximately 20 student organizations on campus.
“We definitely hit a … variety of them, from sororities to underrepresented assemblies,” Singh said. 
Despite the popularity of online platforms, Ayala and Singh said that they spent significant time campaigning in person, handing out campaign pins, flowers and other goodies on Trousdale, Leavey Library and McCarthy Quad with volunteers’ help. The pair also listened to students’ concerns in front of Leavey Library and said they handed out around 60 doughnuts in one day.
According to Ayala, one of the main reasons to go the in-person route was to reach entirely new audiences and escape the echo chambers of social media.
“[On] Instagram, people [who] are gonna follow you are your friends, whereas people on Trousdale or Leavey Library or McCarthy Quad are random people you have not encountered,” Ayala said.
Despite efforts to campaign in-person, interviews conducted by the Daily Trojan confirmed that many candidates opted to use social media to reach students.
“The common thread among everyone’s campaigns has really been the focus on Instagram, which I think is largely due to just the fact that it’s easy to push posts there,” Feighery said. “There’s a strong culture of using Instagram at USC.”
Candidates employed Instagram in different ways, from live streams to Q&A sessions and student voice segments, where students get to voice their support or concerns. Feighery said that knowing how to utilize the app’s features to best reach his audience was important to his campaign, and said that he used graphic design apps, such as Canva, to bolster his social media appearance. 
Ayala and Singh said that one of their Instagram strategies involved handing their account over to students to highlight multiple perspectives.
“We really wanted to give students a voice, so we asked a lot of people, ‘Hey, what’s one reason why you would vote for Devin and Navya?’” Ayala said. “We gave them our platform. We gave them our suggestion box, and they sent in videos … We call it a ‘Why Us’ segment.”
Rishi Malay, a freshman majoring in economics and global studies, said he got information about elections primarily from social media. 
“A lot of the time, it’s just follow requests from Instagram accounts, and then, occasionally, people reposting stories,” Malay said. “[Instagram is] the main method of engagement.”
USG attempted to combat low voter turnout — an issue of prevalence for the last several years —  by increasing the ease of voting online and even providing voters with free In-N-Out in 2020.
For his own campaign, Feighery used new mediums to reach out to underrepresented groups in an effort to address low voter turnout.
“I’ve been engaging with [Chinese Students and Scholars Association] in order to push information on WeChat, which is a platform that affects the Chinese and international student community, but doesn’t affect a lot of the more overrepresented groups at USC,” Feighery said. “Platforms like WeChat really represent where populations at USC as voters have been passed over.”
Undergraduate students can vote online at usg.usc.edu/elections/ or in person until midnight Friday.

In the era of the 120-minute movie and the 22-episode season, it sometimes feels utterly impossible to finish any movie or show. But, when you’ve been in a boring class all day and your brain can’t function any longer, you still need some show to watch, right? When the stress of midterms and graduation becomes scary and overwhelming, why not take a micro-break? Here is a list of British shows to take you out of your chaotic, messy world and put you into someone else’s. 
In the vein of “Fleabag” and “Derry Girls,” most of these shows are female-led, hilarious and completely binge-worthy. Almost all of them are less than two seasons long and you can finish them in about four hours! So take a break — your brain needs it — and enjoy.
“Starstruck” (HBO Max)
It’s a timeless tale: Girl meets famous hot guy, mayhem ensues. 
New Zealand’s Rose Matafeo created, wrote and starred in, “Starstruck” a series of miscommunications. The first season spans one year, with each episode dedicated to a season or holiday. Matafeo’s character, Jessie, is a struggling twenty-something year-old living in England, trying to figure out what she wants from life. 
By the way, once you fall in love with Matafeo, be sure to check out “Baby Done,” a romcom with Matafeo and none other than Harry Potter’s Neville Longbottom (Mathew Lewis) on Hulu. “Starstruck’s” second season has already aired in the United Kingdom and should be headed stateside shortly. 
“GameFace” (Hulu)
Messy was promised and messy shall be delivered. “GameFace’s” heroine steals toilet paper from the local pub and gets fired for showing up to work with “wine lips.” Marcella (Roisin Conaty), a struggling actress, navigates familial dysfunction and heartbreak with saucy wit and a good amount of self-delusion. 
Created and written by Contay, this two-season, quick-hitter is sure to relieve any stress you may be feeling — whether it be your run-of-the-mill existential dread or just an essay due in the next few hours. 
“Crashing” (Netflix)
If you loved “Fleabag” and don’t already know “Crashing,” then consider this your formal introduction. Meet Fleabag’s first draft. But it’s one of those first drafts that’s already pretty good — like the kind of first draft your professor says you only have to revise if you want. 
Phoebe Waller-Bridge created, wrote and starred in this 2016 show — are you sensing a pattern here? “Crashing” is only one season, so you can definitely finish it in a sitting if you need to sit down and mindlessly stare at a screen for a few hours to decompress from your exams. 
Also, you’ll find Damian Molony, who plays the love interest and driving instructor in “GameFace,” and one of the brothers from “Bridgerton” in this show,  too. 
“This Way Up” (Hulu)
“This Way Up” is one of the best shows on this list. Aisling Bea, who writes and stars in the show, is hilarious. An Irish comedian in real life, Bea plays the endearing Aine (pronounced awn-yuh). The series begins with Aine leaving a hospital after having a nervous breakdown. While the show handles some pretty serious topics, such as addiction, suicide and depression, it does so with compassion and humor. Aine’s sister, Shona (Sharon Horgan), is another highlight of the show. “This Way Up” is romantic, funny and important. Also, Bea has done stand-up around Los Angeles recently, so if you like “This Way Up,” keep an eye out for one of her shows.
“Chewing Gum” (HBO Max)
Michaela Coel, known for the award-winning “I May Destroy You,” created, wrote and starred in this super quirky comedy about a sheltered, sexually-frustrated twenty-something woman who is desperate to lose her virginity. This show is bright and tactile and not like anything you’ve ever seen before. 
The sets are reminiscent of the must-watch “Spy Kids” or some other children’s blockbuster from 2001, and the camera gets right up in Coel’s face. 
At times, it can be completely overwhelming, but in the best way. It is a total escape from reality, and you can’t help but love the naivety of Coel’s character. The show is based on Coel’s play, “Chewing Gum Dreams.”
“Lovesick” (Netflix)
So, this one diverges from the rest of the list because it wasn’t written or created by a woman, and the second and third seasons have eight episodes each, not six. But this show, formerly known as “Scrotal Recall, is incredibly charming and endearing. 
It stars Johnny Flynn — from “Emma” (2020) and the band “Johnny Flynn & The Sussex Wit” — as Dylan, a hopeless romantic who has to reach out to all the women he’s slept with after testing positive for chlamydia. 
While it’s about a desperate and unrelenting need for love, this show also pays a beautiful and necessary homage to friendship. 
It’s a little longer than the others on this list, with 22 episodes spread over three seasons, but it is 100% worth it. (Also, it can be a little confusing on the first watch, but stick with it. While unpolished, it’s completely worth the watch).

Last month, the Texas Secretary of State office reported a shortage of voter registration applications just as the Lone Star state was about to enter its first weeks of the 2022 election cycle. This means that civic action groups that run things such as voter registration drives will now be limited to requesting just 2,000 registration forms. The reason for such a sudden shortage of incredibly important forms? The Texas Secretary of State is blaming it on supply chain issues. 
This comes on the heels of recent voter laws that rolled back attempts by numerous Texas counties to make the last election cycle less risky during the height of the coronavirus. With a close end to the pandemic now obscured by the lifting of mask mandates and new variants, the disappearance of expanded voting procedures brings into question just how the 2022 election will change as a result.
Let me be frank: The Texas Secretary of State’s excuse is a sorry one, especially coming from a government office. Home offices run out of paper. Small businesses run out of paper. But government offices, especially those responsible for dealing with elections and voters like for the offices of the Secretary of State, aren’t supposed to be running out of essential office products. We expect these excuses out of businesses because at least businesses aren’t responsible for the production and processing of voter registration forms. We shouldn’t expect these excuses out of government offices whose sole responsibility is to serve the people. Businesses can afford to take a step back or quit. The government can’t.
This critique of the Texas Secretary of State’s office shouldn’t be taken by others as a free pass to start telling Southerners, and especially Texans, that they deserve sorry excuses for government officials and all the consequences that come from that. Quite frankly, I’d argue the opposite. 
The whole “you got what you voted for” line of thinking is the first thing that those with no understanding of nuance will hurl when they hear about any oppressive laws or head-scratching moves from elected officials, especially when it happens in the South. The prevailing conception of the South is that of a backward region full of people willing to vote against their own interests. 
Words can’t even begin to describe how dismissive a concept like that is. It ignores the rich history of progressive, working-class folks in the South. It ignores the idea that people of color are still getting the short end of the stick with regards to how they’re treated by both parties. 
The fact of the matter is that the South is not a monolith, and Texas is no exception. The Lone Star state ought to be proud that it possesses such a unique state culture. The state also ought to be proud that it is the Black and Indigenous people and people of color who call it home make the state’s history all the richer. You’re talking about a state where newly-immigrated Vietnamese came in order to fish, clashed with the Ku Klux Klan and won. 
The fact of the matter is that Texans, and to a larger extent, Southerners, didn’t “get what they voted for.” They came out to vote despite gerrymandered maps and threats of intimidation. They came out to vote while combating a huge wave of voter misinformation. Texans remained steadfast in their commitment to show up and show out at the polls. To discount them so easily and say that they got the incompetent government that they voted for places the blame for the ills of government on people who have been working hard to heal it, rather than on the politicians and elected officials on whom the blame should belong. 
So the next time you hear something head-scratching come out of Texas — or anywhere else where your opinion might be already biased by your view of the region as some kind of monolith — take a step back. We expect better of our government, so don’t go to great lengths and blame government malaise on the folks who it directly affects.

Established in 1996, Brand New Theatre is the oldest student-run production company at USC. Since its founding, BNT has solely highlighted work written by students. BNT has several different branches, including executive, literary, marketing, design and production teams. Sarah Costigan, a freshman majoring in stage management, serves as BNT’s production manager, organizes the technical aspects of each show. 
“BNT is important because it’s a place where everyone can participate in theatre just because they love it. You don’t have to be a theatre major to participate in an ISP, and everyone’s there because they genuinely love creating these plays,” Costigan said. “We only produce student-written works, which I think is the future of theatre. Theatre is meant to be new and exciting, and that’s exactly what BNT is.”
It’s not just the plays that are student-produced, everything related to BNT revolves around students at USC, from makeup to directing and costume design. 
Alex Ketcham, a freshman majoring in theatre, currently works as BNT’s secretary. Joining the company during his first semester at USC last fall, he performed in a one-act production. 
“We have lots of opportunities to get involved as a playwright, as a director, as actors, as designers,” Ketcham said. “There’s so many ways to get involved with this organization, and really take charge and be creative and challenge yourself, and that’s why I love this organization.” 
BNT also offers students playwrights an opportunity for significant professional development as students at USC. 
“I really value BNT because no one expects you to know everything, and they’re really open to teaching aspiring lighting designers lighting design or someone who is interested in sound designing how to sound design,” Costigan said. “I walked in with zero experience as a production manager, and everyone has supported me, and it’s been really awesome. So I value the educational aspect and the environment of BNT.” 
Though BNT initially featured four one-acts in a single show in 2012, the company refocused its efforts on producing full-length productions, several have found success outside of the student-run production company. 
Their first full-length production, “Here’s the Thing,” was selected to be a part of the Hollywood Fringe Festival in 2012. Moreover, the play “GET. THAT. SNITCH.” by Achilles Capone, professionally debuted in Fall 2015 at the Atwater Village Theater in Los Angeles. 
Every semester, BNT’s student producing committee reviews plays submitted by student playwrights. Each production team member reads the plays individually with the names crossed out to ensure fairness. Then, in a group meeting, the students choose one play, though they keep the others in mind for future staged readings. 
This spring, the BNT production team chose to put on “The Bridge of Birds” by Eden Treiman, a junior majoring in  theatre and narrative studies. The play is a modern retelling of a Korean folktale and explores interesting themes of family, love and loss. 
The story follows two star-crossed lovers in Los Angeles, specifically within Koreatown. “The Bridge of Birds” will be BNT’s first in-person full-length production since coronavirus pandemic began and stars Kiana Fong as Jenny, Henry Tsai as George, Mai Yang as Helen, Rebecca Ko as Umma and Thomas Winter as Appa. 
Violet Ko was chosen to direct the production, which is currently in the rehearsal process. Though Ko mainly sees herself as a writer because of her screenwriting background, “The Bridge of Birds” this spring and her one-act last fall have been unique experiences for her and have helped develop her directing skills. 
“I think the past couple semesters have shown me that I actually do enjoy directing and that I would maybe want to learn more about it,” said Ko, a senior majoring in theatre. “Not necessarily that I want to be a writer-director, but definitely I’m open to pursuing it in the future.” 
Ko also enjoys the community aspect of BNT and has made close friends throughout this process.  
“Everyone that’s involved in the production is very excited, and I don’t think you get that very often where you feel like you have this big community where you all are striving towards the same goal, ” Ko said. “The lead actress is one of my best friends. We met our freshman year when we did a musical together. She auditioned for this play, and it was a full circle moment for us where we were extras in a musical that we did together and then now we are doing this production. It’s been fun.”
BNT hosts other events in addition to their Fall One Acts Festival and Spring full-length productions. The company also holds literary workshops with playwrights and, staged readings and film festival. 
“It’s super fun to be able to see a production from its written stage to its performance, and I was able to get a taste of that last semester just by performing in it,” Ketcham said. “It’s just one of the most rewarding things to be able to see it from start to finish, which I think makes Brand New Theatre so special.”
“The Bridge of Birds” opens on April 1 at SDA’s Massman Theatre. The show will run through April 3.
Correction: In a previous version of this article, we incorrectly stated that Brand New Theatre hosts a 24-hour theatre festival. BNT hosts a theatre festival, but it does not have a 24-hour turn-around time. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Dead. Irrelevant. Goofy and embarrassing —this is how the theater is described now. Long before coronavirus introduced itself and promptly took a shit on the stage, theatermakers were struggling to fill seats and acquire funding. Even with the anomalous success of “Hamilton,” straight plays — plays with no musical numbers — haven’t been centerstage of entertainment for over a century.
This considered, it seems reasonable enough to posit theater may be taking a long day’s journey into night, and might even vanish altogether in the next few decades.
 So who in their right mind would choose to study it?
 Over 11,000 students who graduate every year with a degree in dramatic arts in the U.S. alone, that’s who. During the 2018-2019 season, Broadway musicals generated a whopping $1.43 billion and the median salary earned was over $60k. 
 If that’s what death looks like, grab a shovel and start grave-digging because that’s not half bad.
 Western theater was born out of ancient Greece alongside cartography, democracy and the alarm clock. It existed well after the Battle of Corinth ended the Greeks’ Titan rule, through the fall of Rome, the rise of Genghis Khan and even after the Black Plague wiped out half of Europe’s population. It adapted with the invention of improvisational comedy when Italian audiences presumably grew bored of rehearsed lines and adapted again in 17th century England when King Charles II decided sex jokes were funny. 
 Theater’s never so much as dreamt of taking a vacation, let alone withered away like a raisin in the sun. It’s here to stay, albeit in a somewhat less compelling form.
The effect coronavirus had on live events cannot be overstated. For two years, plays and festivals have largely taken place online, and their quality of participation has tanked. Though there are some counterarguments citing the inaccessibility of the more prototypical theater, anyone who’s sat through a Zoom play can tell you that what is gained does not outweigh what is lost.
 Theater isn’t dead. A pandemic simply kicked it out of its house. It’s not the first time; it won’t be the last.
 If that is true, it must also be true that theater degrees are not useless after all. In fact, they impart a variety of invaluable skills to their recipients.
 Dramatic arts programs require a hefty amount of collaboration and communication because that’s what the industry requires of its employees. One large stage play can employ hundreds of people, and it’s absolutely essential to the success of the performance that they all converge with the same overarching artistic understanding and practical follow-through. Otherwise, the event will fall apart and quickly.
 Theatermakers — especially actors — may be better able to handle criticism, even when it’s painfully personal. The competitive nature of the entertainment industry imparts a sort of mandatory resilience. Getting rejected on the basis of hair color, height and nepotism would toughen any person.
 Simultaneously, a career in theater arts is a creative endeavor. Empathy begets creativity, at least according to Chris Adkins, the executive director of the Notre Dame Deloitte Center of Ethical Leadership. 
 “Empathy begins with attention. Creativity does too. In both cases, you pay attention to the data you take in,” Adkins said. “When you empathize with some one, you’re stretching outside of yourself and stretching into that person’s world.”
 Which leads to the next point: stage managers, directors and designers are quick-thinking team members — they have to be. Live events always operate under a certain level of stress and are subject to acts of inconvenient randomness. To ensure a project’s safe and effective operation, crew members must be quick on their feet, ready to pin a falling skirt or reset the stage at a moment’s notice.
 With all of that considered, it would seem theater people make rather valuable members of the workplace, so much so that they check every box on Forbes’ list of most valuable professional skills with the unimportant exception of technical abilities. Computers and their technicians get enough credit for running the modern world; do they really need domain over our black box theaters, too?
 Theater is a live performance subject to change from performance to performance. A campfire lit on Wednesday won’t burn the same as one on Sunday; the kindling, temperature and environmental moisture will inevitably vary . That’s the beauty of classic theater: The promise of surprise, which will never grow old. Filmmaking is built on this same principle, a testament to the art of storytelling’s ability to metamorphose and live out several hundred lifetimes.

Picture this: It’s your senior year of high school, and you’re the star of the basketball team. There are 11  seconds left. You have the ball. The chance of a win is all up to you. No stress, right? You’re the playmaker. In a shocking twist, you pass the ball to the lowly freshman who has zero possibility of moving up the social food chain. The 3-pointer sinks into the basket. And there you go. You win. The gym explodes, and your girlfriend Gabriella Montez serenades you from the stands. You’ve broken up twice in two movies, and let’s be honest here, what is the actual possibility of the two of you staying together? You’re Troy Bolton: the OG renaissance scholar and “get you a man that can do both.” 
I’ve been thinking about sports lately. I mean, how could I not? The Super Bowl was at SoFi Stadium, and the parade for the Rams win snaked around campus. I would be aware of it even if it didn’t interfere with my commute.
In the first three years of my life, the Lakers had a threepeat. The Dodgers have consistently won the pennant (recently, at least). 
Los Angeles sports might, at times, be an embarrassment of riches, have you seen the Lakers’ track record this season? But, I adore it. I grew up idolizing Kobe, rooting for Derek Fisher and loving Pau Gasol and Metta World Peace. I sat in Dodger Stadium in the searing heat of an L.A. summer to watch the Dodgers dominate the 2020 season. 
It should be noted that in this article, I am using a bit more of a liberal definition of sports. While researching for this piece, I was surprised to learn that it’s very difficult to find books about sports that are not non-fiction biographies about the underdog team in a small town. So, bear with me as I go through more sports-like books than strict basketball/baseball/football stories. (But, really, who am I to judge? I grew up going to cycling races in Pasadena and watching the Tour De France each July). 
You’ve probably seen this book on TikTok — or BookTok if you’re in the know — but it’s honestly so fantastic that it’s worth mentioning again. “We Were Liars” is an E. Lockhart book that enjoyed a significant amount of success back when it came out.
How does it relate to sports? They play a lot of tennis and do a lot of swimming. But, of course, the reason that I am recommending it to you is not exclusively because of the half-hearted tennis they play but instead because of the close relationships and secrets that are revealed throughout the book — more secrets than any locker room. 
This is perhaps the most “no plot, just vibes” book that I’ve ever recommended. The main premise of the book is about this group of cousins and friends and the mysterious secrets and hate that underpin the family. It’s tragic. It’s haunting. And now, it is everywhere on your BookTok “For You” page. If you’re missing the 80 degree weather we had two weeks ago, look no further than this book.
But if you’re an autumn fan, there is always Maggie Stiefvater, an underrated writer who makes the atmosphere come alive. You have either heard of her and loved her or you’re about to shut the paper on me because you’re sick of her recommendations. Give it a chance, and you’ll be sucked in.  
Yes, of course, I could easily talk to you about her wildly successful series, “The Raven Boys,” which I adore and think everyone should read. But, if we’re following my generous definition of sports, I think that you should read “The Scorpio Races.” My sports tie-in? It is all about the horses: Man-eating horses. The main plot point is that the main character is determined to win this vicious horse-racing competition. Stiefvater’s novel has life-or-death stakes. It has romance. It’s evocative and beautiful and so very Maggie Stiefvater. 
Therefore, it is my job to recommend it to you. I don’t make the rules. 
Ah, yes. I knew that eventually, I would have to bring up one of the queens of the dystopian/fantasy craze of the mid-2010s. Have you read a Cassandra Clare book? You may have seen the “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones” film with Lily Collins. Anyway, how does this fit in with my loose definition of sports? In every single Clare book, these characters are constantly training in sword fighting and fitness. Each of Clare’s books deal with the world of the Shadowhunters who work to keep their respective regions safe from demons. If you’re looking for a series to keep you occupied until graduation, Clare’s books are perfect. The Shadowhunter Chronicles involves the U.K., the 1800s, the United States and the 2010s. You’re good to go for a while. 
Of course, it should be noted that my definition of sports in literature is not necessarily having to do with running up and down the court and getting it in from the paint and downtown  or whatever else Chick Hearn would say. 
Instead, it’s a little bit more offbeat — but at least, it’s on brand with the offbeatness of this column.

USC men’s volleyball returns home to Galen Center Friday to battle Pepperdine at 7 p.m. It is the first home game for the Trojans since Feb. 10, when they defeated CSUN in straight sets. 
The match provides the Trojans with an opportunity for revenge. They lost a tight 3-2 match against the Waves in Malibu Wednesday night. 
Revenge against Pepperdine is something USC has been awaiting. The Trojans have lost six consecutive men’s matchups against the Waves. The last time they beat Pepperdine was in March 2019. 
“We’ve struggled with Pepperdine in past seasons, coming into this season as well,” said senior middle blocker Liam Schroeder in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But I think our team is a lot stronger than it’s ever been.”
To this point, USC has put up strong results so far, with a 10-3 record going into Friday night’s matchup against Pepperdine. Wednesday night’s loss set them back in MPSF play, however, now sitting 0-1 in conference games. 
This pivotal matchup against a rival presents an opportunity for the Trojans to get on track with a conference win. 
“It’s the start of conference play in the MPSF, and I think it’s time to just buckle down and just keep grinding,” Schroeder said. 
The Waves have had more success in conference play thus far, with a 2-1 record in the MPSF. They have an overall record of 7-4. 
Pepperdine has also suffered two losses against UC Santa Barbara and a loss against UC Irvine, two teams USC has beaten multiple times this season. 
The Trojans and Waves have put up even results thus far. The two teams conveyed their equal skill in Wednesday’s night game, as the two teams matched each other point for point in a back-and-forth battle. 
There could only be one winner, unfortunately for USC, it had a few too many errors in both serving and attacking. 
“When we were down, I didn’t wanna say we were panicking, but we were definitely in an unfamiliar situation for the season so far,” Schroeder said.
To win against the Waves, cutting down on unforced errors will be key. Luckily, the Trojans have played their best when at Galen Center, holding a 6-0 unbeaten record at home this season.
In contrast, Pepperdine has not done well in opposing territory this season. The Waves have put up a 1-3 record in road games this season. 
Playing in front of Trojan fans should help the team relax on their serves and motivate them  to turn the tide on the Waves. 
“We’ll have our home court and some fans at our next game,” Schroeder said. “I’m very confident that we’ll play our game and not worry too much about our last loss.” 
The matchup will start at 7 p.m. Friday at Galen Center.

The Pac-12’s chances at securing a fourth bid in the NCAA Tournament took a major hit when Oregon lost its third game to a team with a losing record.
The Ducks lost to Arizona State, a team that put up only 29 points against Washington State back in December. This is not a good look for what is clearly the conference’s fourth best team.
UCLA, Arizona and USC have set themselves apart from the pack, but the conference can still sneak in a fourth team to make the NCAA Tournament. Washington State, Colorado and Stanford were potential suitors but have largely fallen out of the conversation in recent weeks.
The Pac-12’s last hope lies with Oregon and that glimmer of hope is hanging by a thread.
The Ducks need to win the rest of their games and might even need to win the Pac-12 Tournament if they want to have any shot at cracking the tournament field. 
To understand where Oregon stands in the national landscape, we need to go through a quick recap of the up and down season of the Ducks.
One of Oregon’s first games of the season was a 32-point loss to BYU. From then, the Ducks proceeded to free fall to 6-6 on the season with other disappointing losses to the Cardinal and Sun Devils.
Head Coach Dana Altman, as he does year after year, fixed most of Oregon’s issues and led the Ducks to six wins in a row, includingmatch-ups over No. 3 UCLA and No. 5 USC. A combined 44 points from senior guard Will Richardson across those two games helped the Ducks get back on track, and everything seemed to be looking up for the team.
Oregon could not hold on to that momentum for much longer, though, as it went just 5-4 in its last nine games. The loss to No. 3 Arizona can be forgiven but losses to abysmal UC Berkeley and Arizona State teams should be more than cause for concern. Those losses just might hold the Ducks out of the tournament.
Oregon now has an overall record of 17-10 and 10-6 in conference play. That record could be barely enough to get into March Madness, but the Ducks need to bank on their big wins to carry them to the Big Dance.
Oregon is currently sitting at No. 67 in the NET rankings, the main metric the NCAA Selection Committee uses to choose the March Madness field. With two Quad 1 wins and four Quad 2 wins, the Ducks have a resume worthy of making the field. Zero losses to Quad 4 teams helps as well.
ESPN’s Joe Lunardi sees Oregon’s appeal despite recent shortcomings. Lunardi has the Ducks as one of his first eight teams out of the NCAA Tournament, which feels quite generous with how embarrassing Oregon’s recent play has been.
Oregon can add one more high quality win with its upcoming game against the Trojans, but that would hardly make up for the pitiful losses to the Sun Devils and Golden Bears. 
Those losses will follow the Ducks until Selection Sunday, which may end up being the difference maker for the selection committee.
That’s why the Ducks have to win the Pac-12 Championship — there seems to be no other way. 
Sure, Oregon should be feeling pretty good if it finishes as thePac-12’s runner-up or beats one or two of the conference’s top teams in the postseason before an early exit. That might nudge Oregon into the NCAA Tournament, but not a lot needs to happen for the Ducks to be on the outside looking in once again.
For that reason, Pac-12 fans need to be pulling for Oregon to win the conference tournament. That situation would ensure the conference’s fourth best team — and, outside of the locks for the tournament, the conference’s best shot at advancing in March Madness — makes the NCAA Tournament and with a decent seed for good measure. 
The Ducks have the potential, but Oregon will need to finally show what it’s capable of in this final stretch if they are to be offered a spot in the world’s greatest sporting event.

No. 2 USC heads to Irvine this weekend to participate in the Barbara Kalbus Invitational. The tournament hosts 11 of the top 15 ranked teams in the country. 
While the tournament was not held last year, but in 2020 and 2019, the Trojans came out victorious and were able to reach the final in 2018. Their group for the tournament includes the likes of Arizona State, Long Beach State and Pomona-Pitzer.
Last weekend, USC got its first conference win of the year against No. 2 UC Berkeley in a convincing 13-7 win at Uytengsu. Because of the win, the Trojans improved to No. 2 in the national rankings, jumping up from No. 3. USC, now 8-1 on the year, looks to improve on that this coming weekend.
Head Coach Marko Pintaric was pleased with the team’s improved defensive performance against a strong-sided Golden Bears squad.
“I was very happy and pleased with the way the defense actually played,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “[The] last performance is giving us confidence; the defense is going in a good direction and I really hope that will translate into [the] tournament.”
The Trojans held Cal to its lowest goal total of the season — only the second time the Golden Bears were held under double-digits. USC’s defense stayed especially strong in the second half only allowing 2 goals. The Trojans aim to keep that momentum heading into the Barbara Kalbus Invitational.
The tournament begins play on Friday, as USC takes onPomona-Pitzer, the No. 1 ranked Division III school. The Trojans will then play either the Sun Devils or the Beach, depending on the results of both games. 
USC is slated to play four games in just a three day stretch, but Pintaric feels confident in the team’s ability.
“We look at this tournament as a completion of an important cycle for us, the first part of the season, and we work and taper for that,” Pintaric said. “The team always prepares one game at a time. By that time, we do have valuable intel on every team so we can actually individually prepare for any possible opponent.”
The Trojans’ play this season has already garnered a few accolades. For two straight weeks, a USC player has won the MPSF Player of the week. 
Two weeks ago, senior utility Bayley Weber won the award for her play in the Triton Invitational, scoring 11 goals in the weekend. This week, it was redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns who won the award for her stellar performance against the Golden Bears, scoring 3 goals and gathering 2 steals as well in the win. 
The Trojans feel confident they are well poised to make a deep run in the tournament.
“We’ll see who’s going to win it so it’s almost the ultimate challenge of the teams and coaches and, like I said, we welcome these situations and I’m really looking forward to the tournament,” Pintaric said.
USC kicks off the tournament against Pomona-Pitzer Friday at 10:45 a.m. at Crawford Pool.

USC is preparing for its upcoming three-game home series this weekend to face  Omaha. The Trojans currently have a 2-2 overall record. 
So far, across four games, USC put up 18 runs and 28 hits combined against Santa Clara and San Diego. 
Head Coach Jason Gill highlighted the team’s progress through the first week of the season.
“I think early on in the season, you’re learning your team and they’re learning themselves and how they play as a team, so we’re in the middle of trying to make some of those adjustments,” Gill said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Redshirt sophomore infielder/outfielder Tyresse Turner and sophomore infielder D’Andre Smith are leading the Trojans’ offense with a high percentage rate of contact with the ball. Turner, who has played second base in the past four games, is averaging a .313 batting average with a total of 5 hits and 2 runs scored. His right-hand man Smith, who has played shortstop the past four games, averages .308 with 4 hits and 3 runs scored.
In addition to Turner and Smith, redshirt junior catcher Tyler Lozano has contributed to the Trojans’ total runs. In last Saturday’s game against Santa Clara, Lozano hit a grand slam in the eighth inning which secured USC’s 7-5 victory over the Broncos. 
However, the same success is not being met by the entire team. Redshirt senior outfielder Trevor Halsema has been the cleanup hitter on the lineup for the past three games, but with 16 at-bats, Halsema only has three hits. Additionally, redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas, who has served as the leadoff batter for three games this season, has 15at-bats with only 5 hits. 
“So far, the top of our lineup’s done a pretty good job, and then, we’re falling pretty fast after we get to the five hole,” Gill said. “Some of those guys need to just get their swings lined up a little bit better and get some confidence.”
Gill further discussed how the coronavirus has had long-lasting effects on the team’s early growth. Seeing as many veteran players’ seasons were cut short in the 2019-20 school year, the team lacks substantial experience overall. 
“They don’t have a ton of experience, so they don’t have a lot to lean on,” Gill said. “They put too much emphasis on it early the year, so it’s kind of growing them up and teaching them it’s all part of it.”
The Trojans will host the Mavericks, who are struggling with a 2-3 record overall. Omaha has earned 54 hits and 48 runs over five games against San Jose State and UCLA. 
Still, USC will need to brace itself for sophomore infielder Mike Boeve, who is averaging .579 with a total of 11 hits. Boeve is ranked No. 7 overall in the state according to Prep Baseball Report and may prove to be the greatest threat to the Trojans’ pitching staff this weekend.
“It’s a tough pill to swallow when you’re on the team that gives up the games, but at the same time, as a coach, it’s like OK well, we can resolve these things if we stop beating ourselves we’ll start winning those types of games,” Gill said.
First pitch against Omaha is set for Friday at 6 p.m.
