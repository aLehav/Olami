Can you feel it in the air? 
USC football is back with brand new expectations and pressure. Members of the Trojan faithful are optimistic. This is the year football can return to glory. Most importantly though, fans are back in the stands and the buzz around the Coliseum is high. 
USC has a chance to create a memorable season with a fairly easy schedule at hand. No matchups against Pac-12 north staples such as Oregon and Washington. The colder away games against Washington State and Colorado are played earlier in the season, and an extra week was gifted to the Trojans in preparation for rival Notre Dame.
However, the games still need to be played. Here are my predictions for the difference-makers of the season. 
Team MVP: Kedon Slovis
When I wrote this exact story last year, it was simple — junior quarterback Kedon Slovis would be USC’s clear-cut MVP.
It didn’t really turn out that way after a subpar sophomore season saw Slovis throw for nearly 2,000 yards, 17 touchdowns and 7 interceptions in five games. His completion percentage struggled mightily as well with only one game over 70%. 
Even with all the negatives and disappointing plays last season, Slovis is still the team MVP, simply because the Trojans will live and die off the junior signal-caller’s play. If the Arizona native exceeds his freshman season Cinderella run, which is possible, USC will find themselves in contention for a College Football Playoff spot. If not, well, we’ll be hearing more cries to fire head coach Clay Helton. 
Slovis’ accuracy and arm strength were very concerning last season. Questionable, inaccurate and wobbly throws led to  concerns from reporters and fans about whether he was healthy. 
“My whole life, I’ve been confident with my accuracy and me throwing a football,” Slovis told The Los Angeles Times. “Last season, I’d say for the first time was kind of a point where I wasn’t there entirely.” 
Slovis looked sharper throughout spring practice and fall camp. At his best, he’s one of the more accurate and electrifying quarterbacks in the country with his laser line drive throws and precise passes for touchdowns. 
A presence as cool as the other side of the pillow, the Trojans will need Slovis to be at his best if they hope to return to glory. 
X-Factor: Every receiver outside of Drake London
It’s no secret that the receiving corps for USC this year are very thin. After losing veterans Amon-Ra St. Brown and Tyler Vaughns to the NFL Draft and Munir McClain to the transfer portal, the Trojans are in need of some help. 
Junior receiver Drake London is the clear star of the group. But, outside of him, the names are fairly unproven. 
Sophomore Gary Bryant Jr. was expected to fill some form of a role, but the receiver has been struggling with injuries. Helton recently said Bryant is also out due to health and safety protocols. With a lack of practice time, he will likely be thrown into the lions den against Stanford next Saturday.  
Redshirt sophomore Bru McCoy was also expected to play a big part in the offense. However, he was removed from team activities after being arrested in July on a charge of intimate partner violence. His status is certainly up in the air entering the season.
With a growing amount of uncertainty at the position, Memphis transfer receiver Tahj Washington has seized his opportunity. Washington turned heads with his explosive play during fall camp and scrimmages. He has speed reminiscent of the Road Runner, as he blows by defensive backs for catches. In the open field, his quick feet and agility make him a player with the ability to make big plays. 
Washington has  been building the trust of Slovis along with freshman receivers Michael Jackson III and Joseph Manjack IV. Both men will need to step up. Jackson III, no relation to the pop star Michael Jackson, and Manjack have been impressive at times during practices. 
Manjack and redshirt junior tight end Malcolm Epps were both named starting receivers alongside London and Washington. Veterans like redshirt sophomore Kyle Ford and junior John Jackson III will surely get some playing time as well. 
A young and unpredictable pass-catching group will have to grow up fast.
Best position group: Linebackers
A year ago, USC entered the season with defensive doubts after hiring new coordinator Todd Orlando. A year later, the linebacker crew is the best position group. 
Junior Drake Jackson  is a flat-out beast, capable of breaking up plays with his Herculean strength and lightning speed. Dominant throughout practices and poised for a breakout, he’ll surely be a first-round pick next year.
If you pass Jackson, good luck dealing with senior Kana’i Mauga, who’s been a staple of this defensive side for three years now. Second in tackles for USC last season with 41, Mauga was named to the 2020 Pro Football Focus All-Pac-12 third team. 
 Junior Ralen Goforth and redshirt junior Raymond Scott are more proven and seasoned veterans, who are solid producers. They get the job done and will share time being placed alongside Jackson and Mauga. 
Four-star freshman Raesjon Davis from Mater Dei High School will also most likely see some playing time. A raw talent, it’ll be Orlando’s job to get Davis as comfortable as possible. 
Player most likely to breakout: Keontay Ingram
The Texas transfer has had a Texas-sized impact throughout the spring and fall camps. His off-the-field swag carries onto the field with his bruising run game and elusive speed. Ingram has been a breath of fresh air in this running back room in need of some juice. 
When former back Stephen Carr transferred to Indiana, redshirt senior running back Vavae Malepeai seemed to be locked in as the starter. Helton has now said he’ll be using both in a “1A-1B” approach against SJSU with both men getting carries. Ingram, though, has clearly established himself as the lead back. 
He’s an electric runner who can make big plays while defenders hang on for dear life trying to bring him down. During a sequence in fall camp, Ingram juked Drake Jackson out of his shoes before going on for more yards after the highlight. 
Ingram even shined during the spring football game and fall scrimmages looking agile in the open field. At 6-feet and 215 pounds, his combination of speed and power is an offensive coordinator’s dream. 
However, offensive coordinator Graham Harrell relied on a more pass-heavy Air Raid offense in his two seasons with the Trojans. USC hasn’t had a consistent, legitimate star running back to rely on during Slovis’ tenure. With Ingram’s potential, it might be time to rethink this strategy. 
He’s caught the attention of everyone around Trojan football with his physicality and willingness to work. Add in the fact that he’s also a pass-catching back and he’s the perfect backfield threat for the Trojans.

Junior wide receiver Drake London is used to exceeding expectations. He’s used to standing out among his peers, dominating in his field and having a whole lot to brag about. London has just about all the qualities you would expect from an elite wide receiver. But that’s not the impression you get when talking to him.
One-on-one with London, he sounds like he’s a modest role player, just looking to make an impact for the success of the team. No mention of his numerous individual accolades, he’s instead attributing his success to others — players, coaches and family who have helped him along the way. 
London is known for keeping a calm demeanor and humble attitude throughout strenuous  seasons. He’s no stranger to the dramatics of the game, and he knows how to roll with the punches. 
“I think my parents instilled [that in me] from day one,” London said. “You just have to let your work do the talking on and off the field. People are gonna praise you, regardless if you’re doing bad or good. So, you just got to keep a level head. [In times] that you’re too high, you can’t be too high. [In times that you’re] too low, you can’t be too low … Everything happens for a reason, everything is in God’s plan.” 
Redshirt sophomore receiver Tahj Washington is a transfer from the University of Memphis, and while he may be new to the team, he immediately picked up on the type of player and person London is. 
“He’s real humble; I love that about him,” Washington said. “He [rides] around on campus like a normal person. And that’s contagious as well. You see somebody like him [with] his status, and how people look at him, it doesn’t get to his head. He’ll give you some words of wisdom, how things need to be done in a certain way. [It’s] those little cheeky points that you wouldn’t think about.”
This humble attitude has earned London the respect of his peers. In the leadup to the first game of the season, London was named one of four team captains for the 2021 season. Captains are chosen by the players, as the distinction highlights the team’s most well-respected leaders. 
“It is really, really surreal,” London said. “To be able to be picked by your peers is something special. I never really even thought that I was going to be picked, but it’s a blessing. I thank [my teammates] for the opportunity, but I don’t really think anything has changed to be honest. They picked me for the person I was before that, so I’m gonna stay that person.”
In 2018, the four-star recruit out of Moorpark, California committed to play at USC for not just football, but basketball as well. Heads turned as then-freshman London joined the Trojans taking on the challenge of being a two-sport Division I athlete. With this role came expectations, standards of performance in two different sports. But it quickly became apparent that London was built for stardom. 
“There’s always those steps that happen, the first step was what he did at UCLA two years ago,” head coach Clay Helton said. “All of a sudden we had four 100-yard receivers, and he was one of them. We started a little bit slow, and we needed a spark, and he just [went] off and [made] six guys miss and [dragged] another six into the end zone.”  
London was a standout freshman in an already packed USC receiving corps. He was the third leading receiver in total yards behind now NFL players Michael Pittman Jr., Tyler Vaughns  and Amon-Ra St. Brown. London didn’t have the same instant success in basketball, however, only playing in three games in the 2019-20 season.
“I think I came into [USC] at a perfect time, especially being a young receiver,” London said. “Having guys like Michael Pittman, Tyler Vaughns and Amon-Ra [St. Brown] there, to see them and how they maneuver and work on and off the field has really helped me in my game. I’ll say that Michael Pittman — his aggressiveness and his tenacity on the field — Amon-Ra — how he just goes about his work, everything is Mamba-like — and then [Vaughns] — his swagger and his flashiness.”
As his sophomore season came along, London refused to step on the brakes. He led the team in total receiving yards, averaging nearly 84 yards-per-game and establishing himself as a No. 1 wide receiver threat. After the 2020 football season, it was clear London needed to make a decision: choose to continue as a dual-sport athlete or drop basketball. 
“My parents helped me a little bit with it, but they ultimately let me know that it was my decision to make,” London said. “I wouldn’t say anybody really helped me make that decision. I just made it myself. I had to go with what the Lord God put in my hands before me.”
And so, just as the 2020-21 basketball season began, London officially committed to football full time. Growing up, it was London’s father, Dwan, who instilled him with a passion for the sport of football and the willingness to get better. 
“I’ve had plenty of people, but my dad is the person who has helped me a lot,” London said. “Day in and day out, extra nights after practice, just going out there and just working on things.”
Last year’s football offseason was anything but normal. As the Pac-12 season faced delays, players had to stay fit and ready to go at any point. Back on a normal schedule, the team has had a set goal in getting ready for the opening game Sept. 4 against San Jose State and can prepare with a sense of security that they will have a season. 
“Physically and mentally, I feel better,” London said. “It’s just getting back to that normality of things. And it’s definitely helped the team overall, in my eyes. It’s been more than [just] me.” 
On the field, London brings a rare combination of build and skillset to the table, enabling him to line up as both an inside and outside receiver depending on where the team needs him. He’s a commanding deep ball threat but can also do work in the slot, weaving in and out of defenders with precision.
“He does everything well,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said. “To be as big as he is and [with] the body control that he has is rare. Most guys that are his size have a little bit of stiffness to them. It’s unfair to be that big and that fluid.”
The connection between the quarterback and receiver is one of the most crucial partnerships on the field at any point in a game. For junior quarterback Kedon Slovis, London will be a key target for a third consecutive season, and London said their experience together has helped them fine-tune their understanding of each other on the field. 
“We’ve been in the same boat ever since we got in here and kind of never left the boat,” London said. “So I mean, the connection is definitely there.”
As for the rest of the receiving corps, London admires the versatility of a group with a long list of desirable traits.  
“I feel amazing about the group,” London said. “I think we’re more versatile than we’ve ever been. There’s so many guys with so many different types of attributes. We have that speed, the strength. When we’re in the room together [and] when we’re on the practice field, we’re so close as brothers that it’s gonna make the season fun.”
London is looking forward to returning to a packed Coliseum, as he’s experienced both sell-out crowds and vacant stadiums during his time at USC. 
“It’s gonna be a blessing to have [the fans] back out there,” London said. “So much momentum goes into having the fans out there. I’m really excited to go out there and see them, especially my family, that’s a big thing.”

The last time USC met San Jose State on the gridiron in 2009, the Trojans steamrolled through the Spartans in a 56-3 rout. Head coach Clay Helton and his squad will look to replicate this success in their season opener Saturday at the Coliseum. 
However, the matchup will likely not go as smoothly as it did 12 years ago. The Spartans’ confidence is riding high after thrashing Southern Utah 45-14 last weekend in their season opener. This potent San Jose State offense could give defensive coordinator Todd Orlando some headaches come Saturday. 
“They’ve got experience,” Orlando said in a media briefing after practice Wednesday. “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a team with this many years of experience, just all the way through,offensively and defensively.”
At the helm, graduate senior quarterback Nick Starkel started off his second season at SJSU with a bang, finishing with 394 yards and 4 touchdowns against Southern Utah. Starkel could use the deep ball early to test a USC secondary that lost one of its best playmakers, safety Talanoa Hufanga, to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL Draft. 
Stepping into Hufanga’s spot as the lead safety will be redshirt senior Isaiah Pola-Mao, who landed on Pro Football Focus’ “prospects to watch” list this season. Despite the crater-sized hole left by the departure of Hufanga, Pola-Mao is unfazed by the spotlight, confident in his team and their preparation heading into the season opener. 
“I think we can be the number one defense in the nation,” Pola-Mao said in a post-practice media briefing Wednesday. “If we’re firing on all cylinders, [defensive line], linebackers, [defensive backs], I think it’s going to be hard to get past us. We make plays, and that’s what this defense is set up for.”
If all goes right for the Trojans on Saturday, Orlando’s defense will be able to contain Starkel and keep head coach Brent Brennan’s offense off the field, with junior quarterback Kedon Slovis and USC’s offense dominating the time of possession. 
However, one of the biggest question marks for the Trojans over the last couple years under Helton still persists this season: the offensive line.
If USC hopes to be successful this season, protecting their number nine in the pocket is key. San Jose State may be the perfect opponent to test the validity of this offensive line, with senior defensive end Cade Hall and sophomore edge rusher Viliami Fehoko on the flanks of the defensive line. The duo of Hall and Fehoko led  the Spartans’ pass rush last season, recording 16 of the team’s 26 total sacks. Hall and Fehoko were the only San Jose State players to finish with more than two sacks in 2020, recording 10 and six, respectively.
“Guys like [Cade Hall], [E.J Ane], [Viliami Fehoko],” redshirt freshman offensive lineman Courtland Ford said, naming off some players that coaches have been focusing in on in the film room. “I’m just picking up piece-by-piece, taking notes on what’s their tendencies, getting in and knowing what I can do to combat their moves.”
Four of the five starting offensive lineman from last season will suit up and start on Saturday, led by new offensive line coach Clay McGuire. 
“It’ll be a huge challenge for us,” McGuire said. “These are really good football players … we are going to come out there and play our best game.”
Fans will enter the Coliseum for USC football for the first time in almost two years Saturday. The atmosphere will be a refreshing experience for the crowd, the players and the coaches. 
“We’re excited,” Pola-Mao said. “We’re tired of hitting each other, we’re just happy to be going up against some other color jerseys.”
The Trojans kickoff against the Spartans at 2 p.m. on Saturday.

Last year’s football season was chaotic for USC, who finished No. 21 in the season’s final AP Poll. The Trojans went undefeated in their shortened conference-only schedule until their loss against Oregon in the Pac-12 championship, which was followed by the decision  to not to take part in a bowl game. 
This year’s talented squad is slated at No. 15 in the preseason AP rankings and will be seeking USC’s first conference title since 2017 and the University’s first ever College Football Playoff appearance. Throughout their journey, the Trojans will have some difficult tests both in and out of Pac-12 play. 
5. Week 12 vs BYU
The Cougars ended their previous season on a high note, losing only one game, finishing the year ranked as the No. 11 team in the nation and winning the Boca Raton Bowl against UCF. Much of BYU’s success could be attributed to their former star and current New York Jets QB Zack Wilson, who was the No. 2 pick in this year’s NFL Draft; however, it isn’t wise for the Trojans to brush them aside this year. 
Even though they are starting the season unranked, by the time BYU meets USC in the regular-season finale at the Coliseum, they could have the potential to upset the Trojans’ postseason hopes. The last time the two teams faced off in 2019 in Provo, the Cougars were able to edge out a 30-27 overtime win, the program’s first win over USC in school history. 
4. Week 6 vs Utah
Staying within the same state, the next team that will pose a difficult matchup for the Trojans will be Utah. The Utes head down to Los Angeles in a mid-season test Oct. 9. Conference games against Pac-12 South division opponents are always tough because there is more at stake in the standings, so USC should not take Utah lightly even though the Trojans have won their last two meetings against the Utes. 
One important player that Trojans must prepare for is Utes’ linebacker Devin Lloyd, who is  projected to be one the best at his position nationwide this year and was a finalist for the 2020 Butkus Award. Ranked No. 24 this year, Utah may try to stumble USC midway through this season. 
3. Week 11 vs UCLA
After last year’s thriller at the Rose Bowl where USC won 43-38 with a last-minute touchdown, the Trojans will be looking forward to this season’s edition of the LA rivalry back home in the Coliseum. Although UCLA was not ranked in the Top 25 at the start of this season, they had a strong showing against Hawaii in Week 0, winning 44-10. 
However, a true test to determine how well the Bruins will play this season will be their game against No. 16 LSU Sept. 4 at the Rose Bowl. Like any rivalry, the USC vs UCLA game will be a tough one for the Trojans no matter what, especially as it is scheduled at the end of the season. 
2. Week 9 at Arizona State
Like many games last season, when USC played Arizona State for the season-opener, the Trojans barely got through with a victory, winning 28-27 after an extremely fortunate successful onside kick recovery. Now, the Trojans have to head down to Tempe, Ariz. to play a Sun Devils team ranked at No. 25. 
Like UCLA, this game’s importance is dependent on how well the Sun Devils handle their games before their November matchup against the Trojans. Results against opponents like Utah, Stanford and UCLA will help give clarity about how much of a threat this Arizona State team is. Junior quarterback Jayden Daniels is considered as a top 100 player in the country and can pose a difficult challenge for USC’s defense.  
1. Week 7 at Notre Dame
As in pretty much every football season, the big game tends to be the one against the Trojans’ South Bend rivals. The Fighting Irish are ranked at No. 9 this season after making it to the College Football Playoff last year. Although their inclusion in it was subject to some controversy because they lost badly in both the ACC championship against Clemson and playoff semifinals against Alabama, they are still poised to be a strong team again this time around. 
Looking to replace their star quarterback Ian Book, who went to the New Orleans Saints, Notre Dame has two strong talents with Wisconsin transfer Jack Coan and freshman Tyler Buchner competing for the starting nod. Overall, this late-October matchup in Indiana will have to bring out the best from the Trojans.

As USC enters its third week of the Fall 2021 semester, University health officials are encouraged by the plateau in coronavirus positivity trends and daily case counts. 
Of the record 31,577 tests administered last week, 143 students and nine employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The positivity rate among students increased slightly to 0.5% and declined to 0.7% among employees. The positivity trends continue to stand lower in comparison to L.A. County’s positivity average of 2.42% and California’s rate of 4.9% 
According to USC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman, high vaccination rates, mask mandates and surveillance testing are health protocols slowing the rates of transmission within the USC community. 
“What we’re really happy to see is we’re not seeing a surge in cases and we’re not seeing an increase in prevalence,” Van Orman said. “So right now we’re at a sort of a plateau in terms of the daily cases, weekly cases and prevalence and that really is encouraging.” 
With 91% of undergraduate classes being conducted fully in-person, some students and staff shared concerns over the risk of exposure and transmission in the classroom setting. However, Van Orman said she has not seen any evidence of outbreaks due to classes. 
“We have not seen any outbreaks associated with classrooms, which is good [and] which is of course what we’re looking for,” Van Orman said.
According to Van Orman, the majority of confirmed cases reported last week were due to community spread, which is now happening between students in locations outside of classrooms, such as social gatherings and households. 
“The majority of cases we’re seeing are still sort of what we would call community spread, meaning they’re not associated with known outbreaks,” Van Orman said. “We have seen clusters or outbreaks associated with social gatherings, households but nothing associated with classroom settings.”
Van Orman said the updated trends are “encouraging” but emphasized a sense of caution in the days and weeks ahead. 
“That’s really what we’re going to be watching for in particular over the next week because we are really concerned about two weeks after everybody comes back,” Van Orman said. “The coming days will tell us if we start to see that prevalence start to increase––for that percent positivity to increase.” 
With 160 students actively under a period of isolation at the USC Hotel after testing positive for the coronavirus, the number of available USC-sponsored rooms continues to shrink. According to the USC Coronavirus Dashboard, 54 spaces remain available for positive patients –– a sharp decline from the 187 available spaces that were open last week.
While Van Orman hopes the USC Hotel will remain an adequate place to hold coronavirus-infected individuals, she said there is a contingency plan to increase the number of spaces if necessary. 
“We also have leased space at a downtown hotel,” Van Orman said.  “We’re not putting that on the dashboard yet, but we have a plan to go up to 600 [spaces] if needed,” Van Orman said.  
Following reports received by Van Orman’s office that some students are fraudulently presenting their daily Trojan Check wellness assessment through a screenshot or guest pass to enter campus, Van Orman said that her coronavirus team is in the process of meeting Thursday to discuss enhancing enforcement efforts.
“If you are falsifying your Trojan Check, it is a violation of the Student Conduct Code, so you are subject to disciplinary action,” Van Orman said. “It’s really just an ethical violation because it’s part of our community contract about coming back and staying safe.” 
In addition, Van Orman cited technological shortages as the reason behind long lines and slowdowns at coronavirus test sites that affected nearly every corner of the USC campus last week.
“It was impacting the testing site lines because we rely on being able to quickly call up somebody and scan them in, and we were getting slowdowns and our own staff wasn’t able to access the records at the testing sites, so it was very much causing a slowdown,” Van Orman said. 
However, Van Orman said she is “cautiously optimistic” as the restoration of the Wi-Fi connection announced by Information Technology Services on Monday will troubleshoot campus network issues and resolve the backlogs experienced at some testing sites as well. 
“It was the network that was causing the problem, so we do apologize for that,” Van Orman said.“We’re watching it closely, but Tuesday and Wednesday we had no difficulty at all.”
Van Orman said the University has 57,000 testing appointments available every week and encouraged students to schedule their coronavirus tests in advance in order to secure an appointment. 
As of Sept. 1, the overall vaccination rate among students, staff and faculty stands at 92%. Van Orman said 2% of the student population have received an approved exemption, and the remaining 6% are partially compliant, meaning they are in between their first and second dose. 
USC significantly outperforms local and state vaccination rates that are seen in Los Angeles County and California — 65% and 57%, respectively.
“That’s a really good number. We’re really happy about that number. It’s kind of remarkable –– it’s probably one of the highest numbers you’ll see anywhere,” Van Orman said.

On Aug. 16, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California declared the first-ever water shortage from the Colorado River. The declaration emphasizes the drought the Southern California region has been experiencing for years, and residents of the region are being asked to voluntarily reduce their water consumption. 
In response to the water shortage declaration, USC Facilities Planning and Management intends to continue “USC’s already rigorous water conservation efforts such as sub-meters, low-flow water fixtures and more efficient irrigation systems,” Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
The water level at Lake Mead, the Colorado River’s largest reservoir that supplies water to about 25 million people, was at about 35% capacity Aug. 17. 
“The amount of water that naturally would flow in the Colorado River has been going down but, by itself, [is] not necessarily an issue,” said Jill Sohm, associate professor of environmental studies. “What has been happening is that the demand and the usage of water on the Colorado [River] has been going up at the same time.”
Droughts can occur when a region receives less rainfall than normal. With insufficient precipitation to replenish reservoirs and higher water consumption, water conservation is becoming increasingly important as sources of water become more limited. As rainfall varies from year to year, Western states are in and out of a never-ending drought. Some years, there is enough water to rebuild reservoirs, and in others, there is so little that reservoir usage is reduced.
Western states have many plentiful agricultural zones due to ample sunlight. However, they lack the necessary water to support their crop growth. 
“41 water sub-meters have been installed at the University Park Campus to provide real-time, detailed usage data that helps FPM to detect leaks and make more immediate, better decisions about water management,” Dalrymple said in the statement. “This fiscal year, FPM is targeting an additional 30 locations for water sub-meters.”
Low-flow water fixtures such as showerheads and faucet aerators have been installed into residential housing, “which use 25% less water than their regular-flow counterparts,” Dalrymple said. 
Additionally, 1,680 faucets in 126 non-housing buildings now have touchless low-flow fixtures installed following FPM’s work toward the Universitywide replacement initiative for more sustainable equipment. The Keck Hospital Water Fixture program has installed almost 2,000 water flow restrictors for hospital sinks, showerheads and dialysis machines.
The initiative reduced drinking water usage by 10% since 2014. However, it does fall short of the 2020 Sustainability Plan, where one goal was to decrease potable water use by 25%. The Office of Sustainability is currently collaborating with other USC departments to form a Sustainability Plan for 2028.
Despite functional changes to implement more sustainable equipment, many students and staff also believe changes should happen on an individual level too. If everyone in the United States reduced their average shower time by merely one minute, 165 billion gallons of water would be conserved.
“I know USC is pretty retrofitted as far as showerheads that are very low flow and toilets that are low water use, but I think encouraging students to be mindful of their water use is also important,” said Dominic Borrelli, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies.
Sohm and Borrelli both mentioned signage near showers as a way to remind students to use less water. Dalrymple suggested other ways of practicing water conservation strategies too, such as washing full cold-water laundry loads, using the dishwasher instead of hand-washing dishes and reporting leaky water fixtures to USC Housing. 
Borrelli said education about the impacts of drought would also help others understand that droughts affect more than a lack of water in households.
“I think we’re always told, ‘OK, just shower less,’ and ‘Maybe do this and this and retrofit this,’ but [I wish students knew] what that actually translates to,” Borrelli said. 
By understanding the extent of droughts, individuals can be more aware about the effects of their water usage. Borrelli said that he wishes the University would provide more resources, such as an email to students or information sheets about water consumption, for students to learn about the drought and the effects of their water usage. 
“As students in Los Angeles, we all have an obligation to at least make some changes to make sure we’re not overusing resources,” Borrelli said. “I know that’s perhaps a task that’s quite big for the University to take on and I get it, but I would just like to see more information for people who otherwise would have no idea that California is in a drought right now.” 
However, nearly two-thirds of all water consumption is due to corporate consumption.
“What I want to stress is that at the same time of each person making their own contribution and empowering themselves to do something, we need to hold municipalities [and] corporations responsible for doing their part,” Sohm said. “[Corporations] are so much larger than any one individual and have, as a whole, so much impact that we should not forget about the role that they play in these types of resource issues.”

I think that it was sometime between rewatching “Derry Girls” and contemplating reading “Twilight” that I realized that I was down the pop culture rabbit hole. This wasn’t entirely surprising. After all, I defended my endless television queue by saying that knowing pop culture is the only way that you can win “Jeopardy!” 
The difference here is that there is so much going on in the world right now. As I write this column, there is devastating news coming out of Afghanistan, a hurricane ravaging the South, a pandemic still raging around the world, a recall election in California and, of course, the daily hurdles of life.
How in the world can there be room in our heads for devastating and confusing world news, the details of Wednesday’s test and space to even consider the status of what will happen in next week’s television episode? I consider my shows and my books to be the escape hatch when the news gets overwhelming and the reading for next week’s class seems insurmountable, and “Jeopardy!” played a big role in my thoughts this week. 
The ongoing trickle of entertainment news these past two weeks has been the consistent debate about the new “Jeopardy!” host. After longtime host Alex Trebek’s death from pancreatic cancer, the show has been running on a rotating guest host basis. For a couple of weeks it was fan favorite LeVar Burton, then Mayim Bialik, Savannah Guthrie, Anderson Cooper and so many more. In a weird twist, it made me think about dating in books. After all, isn’t that what we do with guest hosts? It’s a 22-minute speed date in which we get to know their mannerisms, their laugh, the questions they ask and their personality. Also, just like after a real date, your family and friends text you their opinions on the match. 
Dating in books is — for lack of a better word — storied. There were the massive love triangle stories in the early 2010s where readers would proudly declare if they were “Team Gale” or “Team Jacob,” and there are those that blush if the name “Mr. Darcy” is mentioned in passing. However, the topic of dating in books today has primarily to do with tropes. The debate is often in the hallowed halls of Twitter between “enemies to lovers” or “friends to lovers.” The same end result, but different ways of getting there — either through hate or a slow burn. 
Perhaps the most popular of “enemies to lovers” right now is “Red, White, & Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston wherein a prince of the United Kingdom (Henry) and the son of the U.S.’s first woman president (Alex) somehow go from an intense hatred for one another to seeing the possibility of love in their future. It takes place in the present day and has enough snark and heart to really appeal to most anyone. We see Alex and Henry build bridges over their previous hatred over text, and honestly, it is all insanely quotable.
This is the sort of story that got non-readers to emerge from hibernation and once again find reading in their lives during the pandemic. There is an argument to be had that all “enemies to lovers” stories stem from English major favorite “Pride and Prejudice” by Jane Austen where Elizabeth Bennet does not immediately fall for the brooding Mr. Darcy. Of course, a story on the origins of the trope might be better suited for a paper.
For me, I do enjoy “enemies to lovers,” but I suppose that I like fluff too much and that’s why I prefer “friends to lovers.” I also believe Emily Henry to be one of the best romance authors of the moment and all of that made for a magical combination in “People We Meet on Vacation.” It is also another instance where I judge a book by its cover, read the synopsis, see “friends to lovers” and then click “add to cart.”
“People We Meet on Vacation” follows two best friends Alex and Poppy, their differing lives and the summer vacation they take every year. The previous trip they took did not go perfectly, and Poppy wants to rectify it by making the trip to solve all trips. Henry engages in the most fantastic dialogue, featuring wonderful descriptions of far-off places and capturing that elusive summer feeling.
It is also worth noting that Henry has dipped her toe in the “enemies to lovers” pond as well with “Beach Read,” which is fantastic for any aspiring authors out there who dream of writing away in a cottage with a body of water just outside the window. But, perhaps my most favorite “friends to lovers” story is “Anna and the French Kiss” by Stephanie Perkins (who is having her horror book “There’s Someone Inside Your House” adapted to Netflix in time for spooky season this October). The main character, Anna, is sent to boarding school in Paris and there she meets a group of friends and a certain British-French guy with whom she becomes friends with. Of course, he has a girlfriend.
So, maybe what I’m saying here is that my mind often finds a way to put the most seemingly disparate things together, and maybe what I’m saying here is that perhaps LeVar Burton will be a guest host. Of course, the one thing to be certain of is that I’ll be back with more book-to-media connections.

As if 2021 couldn’t get any stranger, actors Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin headlined Hulu’s new murder mystery comedy, “Only Murders in the Building.” Its first three episodes premiered Tuesday. 
Set around an upscale New York apartment building, the Arconia, the building’s residents Oliver (Short), Charles (Martin) and Mabel (Gomez) are strangers. The trio never cross paths until they are forced to evacuate their building when a resident dies by suicide. But, all three believe it was murder. Needing a place to go, the three independently stumble into the same bar, vaguely recognize each other from awkward elevator rides and bond over their unlikely shared interest in a murder mystery podcast.  
Here, we also meet each member of the trio, learning about them through long monologues while they walk through the city. Upon first watch, these scenes are too long and seem like lazy writing, but they are in fact a parody of the long monologues used to meet characters in murder mystery podcasts.
Charles is a jaded slightly-over-middle-aged actor, desperately clinging to his lingering fame from when he starred in the 90s show “Brazzos.” His brazen attitude contrasts with Oliver, a flamboyant, bright-purple-coat-wearing, delightful old man. The final member of the trio is Mabel, an imposter to the Arconia, living in her aunt’s apartment, pretending to be wealthy and hiding that she knows the alleged murder victim. 
Quickly, we learn the roles each character plays in this satire. Charles is the organized, work-orientated one who’s hesitant to get emotionally invested in the group. Oliver is your vivacious uncle who comes into town every couple of years for a whirlwind weekend and then seems to disappear (but yet, you still know he cares about you). And Mabel is the actress, pretending to be one type of person to fit into the group while simultaneously hiding a dark secret.   
The trio is charming but flawed. Short’s performance is incredible; his ability to wrap you around his finger whenever he is on screen is unmatched. Martin gives an exceptionally strong performance as Charles, forcing the viewer to have no choice but to enjoy the grumpy burnt-out older man in a comedy troupe. 
Mabel, however, is where the trio falls flat. It is hard to tell from the first few episodes whether that is from weak writing or Gomez’ poor performance. Mabel is hiding pieces of herself and lying so suspiciously that even the remaining clueless duo realize something is wrong. Yet, although Mabel’s discomfort is part of her character, Gomez’s presentation on screen appears shaky and tense. She seems frightened to be on camera, making her performance far less enjoyable than that of her co-stars. Despite being an odd addition to the duo, Mabel allows the show to rely on confused and ageist old man tropes like Oliver and Charles struggling to use the internet and having someone younger do it for them. 
The unlikely trio quickly becomes a real-life Scooby gang, deciding to do the super logical thing and investigate the alleged “murder” that occurred in their building after the NYPD rules it a “suicide.” Viewers get to watch the hilarious duo of Charles and Oliver go to war with each other while attempting to record the podcast with Charles as the voice and Oliver as the director. They learn more about Mabel’s mysterious background, slowly uncovering small details about her past at the Acornia, making her far more interesting than her colleagues. 
Unfortunately, “Only Murders in the Building” severely falters in its attempts to satirize stereotypes in murder mystery podcasts — frankly because the show does not make its jokes obvious enough. The monologues are boring, weird and only clever if the viewer takes the time to think about why the writers might have included them. Same with how the cops magically seem to leave the crime scene untouched and open for anyone to stumble upon and how the trio knows a secret back entrance into their apartment building, which no one else has heard of, allowing them to check out the crime scene. 
Without understanding their purpose, these moments appear as “Riverdale” quality scenes, diminishing the value of the show. However, “Only Murders in the Building” is not for someone looking to throw on a TV show in the background while they do other work. The writing is complicated, meant to mimic the experience of listening to a murder mystery podcast. This might be obvious to the murder mystery podcast aficionado, but it is confusing to the average Hulu viewer. Unfortunately, because the writing presumes its viewers already know about stereotypical murder mystery podcast tropes, casual viewers are left out of the show — lost as a result  of the unwritten prerequisite for enjoyment. 
“Only Murders in the Building” is good, but not great. Whether the issue is Gomez’s bashful delivery, the barrier to understanding the comedy or something else is hard to say — but something is missing. Despite the show’s confusing components, we shouldn’t give up on it too soon. Each episode gets progressively better, and as long as your brain can handle the meta-commentary on viral media, the show is worth watching.

More than a year ago, one of the first major outbreaks of the coronavirus in the U.S. took the lives of over 37 staff members and residents in a Washington nursing home. 
Despite literally majoring in the study of old people, I never gave any thought to the notion of living within one of these spaces until reading about the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Wash. Granted, investigators later determined the conditions in the Washington nursing home had been egregious and far below an adequate standard of care; but who knows how many older residents still live under similar conditions today? 
Here’s a quick disclaimer: If you get lucky and profit from selling the Beanie Babies in your garage, you might be able to retire at your own home or even a well-maintained living space within a senior living community. But realistically, older adults in nursing homes only make up about 4% of the older U.S. population, which rounds out to about 1.5 million older adults. Nevertheless, residents in nursing homes still exist and deserve the same amount of care as the next person. 
The pandemic exposed the downfalls of communal living spaces. While college students simply packed up and abandoned their dorms, those living in nursing homes did not have that option, often left behind by family members who had no space to accommodate them. With staff moving in and out, along with late adjustments in guest policies, it’s no wonder that many of these communities became the early hotspots of coronavirus-related deaths.
Besides the coronavirus, nursing homes are prone to outbreaks of seasonal influenza and other common viruses. Regardless, the pandemic has created a new and interesting situation for nursing home staff and leadership who are responsible for their vulnerable clientele. 
Even beyond being ill-equipped for pandemic-scenarios like the coronavirus, nursing homes and assisted living communities need to realize that older adults aren’t a static generation. Dressing up the living space like a ‘50s retro diner and playing artists of the past will not cut it anymore. With age-related and generational cohorts changing by the year, the needs and wants of these older adults warrant necessary changes to encourage a shared space. 
For example, the stereotype of the sterile atmosphere, drab carpets and peeling wallpaper lining the hallways leads many to believe that nursing homes resemble low-funded haunted houses that just happen to be filled with old people. 
The living space needs to change and adjust for individualized needs given the handful of chronic diseases that older people face nowadays. There needs to be living rooms that inherently invite older people in rather than lock them away from the rest of the world, areas for outdoor recreation beyond the classic lawn bowl or long walk and spaces for occupational engagement for those interested in getting involved with their community. 
Additionally, research within the past two decades has shown a great deal of discrimination against Black populations living in nursing homes, whether it be by staff or other residents. Marginalized groups are less likely to participate in social events and report a lower quality of care in comparison to white residents. 
In terms of coronavirus cases and care across the country, nursing homes with a larger Latinx or Black population were more likely to experience coronavirus outbreaks compared to those primarily made of white residents. This disparity, along with a severe lack of data about marginalized groups in their later years, goes to show how nursing homes and assisted communities completely miss the mark in terms of quality of care and patient satisfaction. 
Essentially, we have to overhaul the whole damn thing. From reworking the business framework of these communities to developing new, wider spaces for engagement, there’s a serious amount of potential for anyone interested in supporting the needs of older adults in an evolving market.
In many ways, the future of nursing homes should emphasize the latter part — the home. 
Lois Angelo is a junior writing about the timeless lessons learned from older adults. He is also an associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan.

A quick tap through an Instagram story lineup will reveal what many of us already know and perhaps are trying to forget: Our phones are listening to us, and they really want to sell us something.
More truthfully, they want to sell us everything. According to a study from Baylor University, the average female college student is on her phone for 10 hours every day. Counting up all the minutes spent creating Spotify playlists, scrolling mindlessly through Instagram and watching YouTube videos before bed, it’s easy to see where half the day goes. (Male college students are not off the hook, by the way; they’re sinking eight hours into Twitter and email.)
Exactly how many advertisements are we seeing in those eight to 10 hours? Well, if we count the Snack Break jewelry ads, Magic Spoon, HelloFresh, Billie razors and that Culver City-based indie-folk band we’ve never heard of, that brings our grand total to around 4,000 to 10,000 daily advertisements. That’s a ton of marketing agencies vying for our attention, and small businesses are paying upwards of $10,000 per month for them to do it. Are they getting what they’re paying — a lot — for? 
The short answer is kind of — sometimes. Most online advertisements fade to white noise for the average social media user, so much so that, even after long periods of exposure, some consumers find it difficult to recall even the name of a brand they’ve engaged with numerous times. 
It’s a simple case of pruning, which sounds like a gross skin condition but is actually an evolutionary mechanism. It’s the reason we can’t discern our own scent from others’ or notice that the check engine light is on after driving around unbothered for a week or two. We’ve grown so accustomed to it that our brain decides it isn’t worth the energy to notify us of its presence. If there’s no likelihood of danger, there’s no sense in letting us know it’s even there.
Of the thousands of ads experienced every day, we consciously only notice about 100, leaving the vast majority completely abandoned like the waste of money and resources they are. 
What exactly does this mean for advertising agencies? Not much: Advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it’s only projected to grow. While a handful of companies are beginning to drift away from more traditional marketing techniques and shifting to more conscious, permission-based ones, the advertising industry is unlikely to change despite obvious overkill and consumer frustration. Digital salespeople are like Jordan Belfort and his army of Wall Street douche-canoes: They’re willing to throw their money around for the sake of letting you know that they have it.
The impact is felt by us, the unwitting youthful consumers. The purpose of any advertisement — even the Calm app ones — is to alter the mind of the audience. To accomplish that in an oversaturated market, advertisers often employ covert tactics. 
Neuromarketing, for example, is a sales technique that sparks a sense of motivation. Think gym memberships and healthy food delivery services: There’s a reason royalty-free upbeat music is always playing in the background. According to the Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics, “Regardless of the technique used, the stimuli that are presented outside of the conscious mind are formatted to manipulate the viewer by targeting one’s autonomic arousal or emotional state, making it biologically more difficult for the subject to reject the effects that the advertisement will have on them.”
The beauty industry employs this tactic all the time. For example: Every college student in Southern California needs this face wash because, without it, they won’t make any friends and life will be unbearably lonely. When we receive this information, it activates an unconscious emotional response, and because our brains prioritize emotion, we’re now unintentionally paying attention and feeling guilty as we do it.
Advertising is a vital component of a capitalist economy. It’s not going anywhere, and while it would be fabulous if wealthy corporations had a change of heart and retired their clandestine, coercive ad campaigns, it behooves us to not be too idealistic. 
It’s up to us to consume responsibly. Cutting back on internet usage and installing an ad-blocker are manageable places to start. Our unconscious brain can’t absorb passive-aggressive sales pitches if they’re blocked from our homepage, and our cellphones can’t sell us anything if they’re turned off.
