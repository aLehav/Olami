Over the course of two months, the Daily Trojan staff filled out an internal survey that had a series of questions related to personal identities. As newsrooms across the country, both professional and student alike, reckon with the lack of intersectionality and representation among their staff, we realized that the Daily Trojan is not and should not be an exception to criticism. 
The purpose of our staff report is to, with full transparency, disclose which groups of people are writing about the University’s student body and community. Moreover, the report displays several areas with alarming statistics that demonstrate the Daily Trojan is failing to meet our own standards. 
Representation, in all aspects, is vital. When it comes to journalism and news reporting, staff representation ensures that communities are being described by those who know the group the best, not by people who will never understand its lived experiences and multifaceted nuances. 
Thus, through this report, the Daily Trojan acknowledges that there are areas in which we are missing important perspectives on our staff. We do not have anyone on staff who identifies as Native American, Indigenous or Alaska Native. We do not have anyone on staff who isn’t cisgender-identifiying. Additionally, we have an overwhelmingly straight newsroom. 
This significantly impedes our ability to report on these communities and on so many other groups that makeup the University’s diverse student body. 
Our methodology 
The diversity staff report covers six areas: class standing, race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, student status and record of disability. These areas were chosen as a means to represent the Daily Trojan newsroom in the most holistic manner possible. 
While most of these attributions are common in demographic surveys, we wanted to include student status data to reflect on the varying socioeconomic and educational backgrounds of our staff. Student status includes individuals who identify as one or more of these following traits: international, low-income, first-generation, transfer, spring admit and receiving need-based financial aid. There is an option of “none” for those who did not identify themselves with any of those traits. 
More than 200 staffers of the Daily Trojan filled out the internal survey; our Fall 2020 masthead and sports staff were the only sections to have a 100% response rate. 
Analysis of the data 
Individuals who identify as Middle Eastern or North African, Black or Latinx/Hispanic make up the smallest percentage of the Daily Trojan newsroom, representing 4%, 6% and 9% of our staff, respectively. White people, totaling to 31%, and East Asian or Pacific Islander people, representing 25%, are the two best-represented racial populations of all the staff at the Daily Trojan. 
In comparison to USC’s racial demographics for Fall 2020, the Daily Trojan’s staff meets or is near most of these percentages, the exceptions being the proportion of Asian people and Latinx/Hispanic people. 
Our editorial staff does not have anyone who identifies as Native American, Indigenous or Alaska Native nor Middle Eastern or Northern African. Only 3% of our editorial staff are Black.
In terms of student status, 34% of our staff indicated that they receive need-based financial aid; 16% of staffers noted they are low-income students. Eighteen percent of our entire staff are first-generation college students and 14% are transfer students. 
The majority of our staff are non-disabled people, with only 12% of individuals indicating that they have a disability or have a record of one. 
As mentioned earlier, the Daily Trojan does not have any who identifies as transgender, non-binary, gender non-conforming or gender fluid. Our cisgender staff consists of 73% women and 27% men. 
A similar ratio of women to men is maintained throughout various sections, with the exception of the sports staff, which is 73% men and 27% women. 
Finally, the results for sexual orientation show that the Daily Trojan newsroom is 73% straight. The percentages for all staff who identify as bisexual, pansexual, queer, lesbian, gay or questioning are all under 10%. 
Moving forward 
These numbers are, unfortunately, far from surprising — nevertheless, they are important details to be cognizant of in the future. In terms of recruitment for next semester, it is our goal for this report to show us which communities need more representation on our staff and which individuals we have historically excluded from our newsroom. 
The report shows us that the Daily Trojan is not accessible to individuals from low-income backgrounds; therefore, more work must be done to eradicate any financial barriers that would prevent people from joining our staff. The report also highlights us that our majoritarily non-disabled newsroom can be susceptible to ableist practices, whether implicit or not. 
As a historically-white institution, it is imperative that the Daily Trojan commits itself to anti-racist efforts, which includes coming to terms with the privileges that a lot of our members have. 
This report will serve as a reminder to the Daily Trojan and all of its staff that a newspaper cannot serve its community well if the newsroom is not reflective of the people it writes about.

The Class of 2024, USC’s largest incoming class ever, has the highest number of first-generation students in the University’s history, USC News reported Tuesday. 
This year’s incoming class had 3,460 freshmen, with 22.5% of the class comprising first-gen students. This is a 7.5 percentage point increase in first-gen students, up from 15% last year. Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said that the University has long had an interest in this type of diversification, but that the new USC Affordability Initiative, which guarantees a tuition-free education to students whose families make $80,000 or less a year, may have helped encourage matriculation. 
“I think that affordability initiative really helped us to further illustrate to prospective students and their families that this is something, if admitted, something that could help make USC a much more realistic option for them,” Brunold said. 
As a whole, the Class of 2024 received $400 million in financial aid from University sources, which is a $25 million increase from last year. 
This year’s incoming class was also the first to start USC with access to the First Generation Plus Success Center, which Brunold said was one of the ways the University supports admitted first-gen students. The First Generation Plus Success Center, which President Carol Folt announced this summer, is a resource and support hub that aims to help facilitate the transition of first-gen students to college life. 
“It’s more important than ever that the University continues to support these students, and I’m really pleased with what I’ve seen,” Brunold said. “First-generation students, local students are really being embraced at the University.” 
The University saw a 3 percentage point increase in underrepresented students of color, a group that includes Latinx/Hispanic, African American, Native American/Pacific Islander and students with multiple ethnicities. The Class of 2024 comprises 30% underrepresented students of color, with slight increases in Latinx/Hispanic students and Asian/Asian American students, who are not included in the underrepresented statistic. The number for Black students remained at 6%. 
The USC Leslie and William McMorrow Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a seven-year free college prep program for high school students in South and East L.A., also expanded its efforts, Brunold said. This year’s admissions cycle included the first NAI graduating classes from Lincoln and Wilson high schools, and the Foshay Learning Center continued to be a top local feeder to USC, sending 25 students to the University this year. Brunold said that as the NAI program continues to expand in the area, he expects more local students to attend USC. 
Beyond L.A., students from California continue to be the most represented state in USC’s incoming class, followed by New York, Texas, Illinois and Washington. International students made up 12% of the incoming class, a decrease from past years likely due to the coronavirus pandemic, Brunold said. There was also an increase in California-based students, which Brunold said likely shows many students opted to stay closer to home this admissions cycle.
“But that being said, it is still the case that the majority of our students are coming from outside of the Southern California area,” Brunold said. “So while I do think there was an impact, I don’t think the impact was that great in the overall scheme of things.”
While Brunold did not note significant enrollment differences because of the pandemic, he said that the admissions office increased its acceptance rate for the Class of 2024 because of the uncertainties around enrollment. The first-year admission rate was 16.1%, which is a 4.7 percentage point increase from the 11.4% acceptance rate for the Class of 2023. Before this year, the University’s admission rate decreased every year since 2015. 
“We release admission decisions toward the end of March. That was the same time as we all remember that everything was really grinding to a halt, so there was a lot of uncertainty in higher education,” Brunold said. “We were just happy in the admission office that we didn’t have to disappoint so many students. That being said, a lot of the admission rate has to do with thinking about what’s going on at the time … the admission rate this year was about 16% and that was definitely in response to thinking about the uncertainty.”
Last year, USC accepted 7,558 students, 42% of whom enrolled in Fall 2019, making it one of the highest yield rates in University history. This year, USC had a lower yield rate, with 36% of the 9,618 accepted students enrolling for Fall 2020. Unlike some other universities, students at USC were not allowed to defer enrollment because of the pandemic.
Of those students, 1,447 transfer students enrolled at USC this fall. Forty-one of these students are veterans or reservists and 52% of them previously attended a California community college.
“There’s always been a commitment to transfers at USC, and I don’t really see that changing at any time,” Brunold said. “Not only do we conduct outreach and recruitment for first-year students, but we also treat transfer students again as their own population. They’re not an afterthought at USC.”

Lyndzi Ramos found her love for drawing at the age of three. She remembers looking at the bee on the Honey Nut Cheerios box and having an impulse to put pen, crayon or pencil to paper and create. The rest was history. 
Through her proclivity for drawing came Ramos’s fondness for animation and storytelling. Out of tens of thousands of submissions, Ramos won the 2020 Doodle for Google competition for her home state of Arizona in August. 
Growing up with a Jewish New Yorker mother and a Mexican immigrant father, Ramos learned early on the value of inclusivity, a driving force in her creations and desire to share stories from all walks of life. Ramos said it was important for her to create visual artwork that anyone can see themselves in.
“Kindness has always been a very big thing for me and my family,” Ramos said. “I’m a bigger girl myself. I’m tall, I’m 5’11”, and I have always been the standout person in my classes. I have been a victim of bullying and taunting for the way I look.”
This year’s Doodle for Google prompt was “I show kindness by,” which Ramos said she instantly connected with. 
“It just immediately clicked,” Ramos said. “My art has always been progressive and hoping to represent underrepresented audiences. And honestly, I dream to have my art be able to have a theme of social justice, diversity and equality.” 
Ramos’ high school creative writing teacher, Christopher Deminie, noted her ability to stay humble about her work.
“Every time somebody would compliment her on things she would be modest about it,” Deminie said. “[It is] adorable to watch one of your kids grow up to be a talented person.” 
Deminie complimented both Ramos’ dedication and initiative in academic settings and said he was impressed by her knack for channeling important messages into her art. 
“She’s choosing to focus her attention on her art to give a message to other girls … it’s OK to be who you are,” Deminie said. “Her stuff deals with body positivity and tolerance for people that are different than you. It’s really refreshing for other people to have a high school student … want to represent that idea in such an open manner.”
Colorful pastels and representation are at the foundation of the artwork Ramos submitted for the competition. In her piece, Ramos is centered with swirls of ribbon sprouting from her pen as she looks down at a piece of paper. The first “g” in Google is a depiction of two children. One has a prosthetic leg and is helping another girl who has vitiligo, a nod toward Ramos’s father who has the skin condition. 
The first “o” is formed by an LGBTQ+ couple who are both people of color, and one doesn’t fit mainstream body expectations and beauty standards. The lowercase “g” is a Muslim woman wearing a hijab, and the “l” is depicted by an Asian woman who is pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair, representing the “e.” 
“I just wanted to hit as many places as I possibly could,” Ramos said. “I wanted to create a beautiful composition of color, diversity [as] a sign of hope for people in the future.” 
Kelsie Ramos, Lyndzi’s younger sister, recalled the win being meaningful to her sister.
“We were just overwhelmed because we knew how much it meant to her, especially with the category they had chosen,” Kelsie said. “She knew she fit in perfectly with [the category] and she deserved it.”
It was not Ramos’s first time entering the competition, so she said winning brought on untapped elation in the otherwise dreadful year. For Ramos, creating art is her way of sharing positivity in society. 
Ramos is now a freshman studying animation and digital arts at the School of Cinematic Arts. When she was selecting colleges, USC was at the top of her list. 
“I knew this was the school I wanted to go to,” Ramos said. “There was just so much passion, history and drive behind everything. USC is just such an incredible institution. I was just so scared at the thought that I might not be able to be a part of it.
“I’ve always been determined to go after my dreams and to pursue what I love, which is drawing and animation,” Ramos said. “I want to help make the world a better place through my art.”
While pursuing animation at USC, Ramos wants to continue to share diverse experiences and voices in her storytelling. She said her end goal is to create a show where her characters portray the fight for equality, body positivity and social justice and address the hardships of growing up in a continuously changing society. 
“I can remember growing up and not really seeing myself in the media, and I’m sure that’s the case for millions of people,” Ramos said. “There’s so much work that needs to be done, and I want to help get it done.”

In the same way the system was not designed to protect Breonna Taylor, the system was not designed to find justice for her, either. 
As reported by The New York Times, the police came to Breonna’s Taylor’s door because her ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, who they believed to be involved in the drug trade, had once-upon-a-time received packages at that address. That was all it took for a judge to approve a “no-knock warrant,” allowing them to break into the home of Taylor, an EMT with no criminal history. 
Even though the judge had approved a “no-knock,” the officers’ orders were changed to “knock and announce” — meaning the officers had to identify themselves. The officers involved insist that they did just that, were met with no response and were forced to break down the door. The evidence indicates otherwise. After breaking down the door, the police were met with defensive shots from Taylor’s boyfriend Kenneth Walker, for which they returned a hail of blind gunfire — five shots of which ended up killing Taylor. 
Taylor’s boyfriend Walker, who shared the apartment with her that night, insists that the police did not announce themselves. His account is backed up by the fact that he, a man with no criminal history, shot at the would-be-intruders with his legally owned firearm, a reaction that any armed, reasonable person might have upon a suspected break-in. No drugs or cash were found in the apartment — this was not a man with any reason to shoot at the police. 
Compounding the evidence, Walker immediately called 911 in hysterics, crying, “I don’t know what’s happening, someone kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend.” Further, the police incident report does not paint a picture of a force committed to truth — they listed Taylor’s injuries as “none” (she was shot five times) and noted that the officers had not used force to enter the apartment (they broke down the door with a battering ram). 
In the days leading up to the shooting, while the police were plotting the raid, she was working overnight shifts at the hospital’s emergency room. The night the police killed her had been her date night. She and her boyfriend had dinner at a steakhouse and capped the night off with a movie in bed. The last thing she said before she fell asleep was “turn off the TV.” 
I think it is important to note that Taylor did not die in her sleep. By the moment of her death, she had been woken by the breaking down of her door by who she believed to be intruders and the shots fired by her boyfriend to protect them from the would-be-intruders. She was very much awake for her final moments. 
Even if the raid had not culminated in Taylor’s killing, the factors leading up to the raid seem designed to terrorize a young Black woman. A judge signed a no-knock warrant for the home of a woman with no criminal record who was only vaguely and tangentially related to the supposed investigation. The raid occurred only after the main suspect in the larger investigation was already in custody. The police waited outside her apartment until the dead of night when they knew she was asleep before breaking down her door to execute the warrant. Throughout the process, Taylor was awarded no grace, not even a passing thought to her humanity. The police acted as if she were an enemy combatant in war. 
The chain of events defies logic not only because a few cops chose brash militarism over the semblance of peace that Taylor and the community might have been afforded had the officers waited until the morning, obeyed their orders to knock and announce before executing their warrant, but also because their actions were sanctioned at every level of the chain of command. The system not only allowed but instructed the police to terrorize Breonna Taylor in her home. 
What is arguably more frightening and disturbing is that, under the doctrine of qualified immunity (legal protection that shields government officials, including law enforcement officers, from liability for damages in civil suits), it seems that the actions of the officers involved will withstand legal scrutiny. Given the fact that Walker shot first, it is highly unlikely that Taylor’s killers will ever be held accountable, as police officers are legally afforded expansive discretion in their use of excessive force when there is an imminent threat, such as gunfire.
That is why the grand jury’s decision not to indict any of the officers for Taylor’s death comes as no surprise to me. Of course, there were complicating factors — the prosecutor’s office being led by a 34-year-old, President Donald Trump-endorsed, Mitch-McConnell-acolyte contrasted with the public pressure campaign calling for the arrest of the officers involved. But fundamentally, the system that killed Breonna Taylor was never going to prosecute its own agents of violence. 
And in truth, the buck should not stop at the officers who were directly involved in the shooting. They acted with a clear disregard for human life, but that was their job. We will never be able to implement meaningful reform and change by targeting individual actors within a rigged system. Breonna Taylor’s death is the inevitable result of an increasingly militarized police force and a law enforcement culture that dismisses Black life and death.

The idea of diversity and inclusion (often simplified to D&I) has been a longstanding requirement for both schools and workplaces in order to provide a safe environment for people of all backgrounds. Although the idea of D&I may be well-intentioned and has enabled progress in many respects, the history of this initiative is rooted in assimilationist thinking. 
According to Los Angeles Times California columnist Gustavo Arellano and USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism professor Félix Gutérrez, who spoke at the 1970 Chicano Moratorium, these initiatives began after the civil rights movement in order to desegregate spaces. At a time when many white folks were adamant about diversifying their workplaces and schools, these quotas of increasing diversity and providing workshops to become more inclusive made sense. The problem is that many of these efforts instead cause segregation within work and school spaces and encourage people of different marginalized groups to assimilate into the Anglo culture. 
For one, when having conversations concerning race, there will always be people who are adamantly against being open-minded and cooperative. Although forcing these types of people to have tough conversations is good for their own growth and knowledge, it also forces members of marginalized communities to sit in a room with closed-minded people, harming the very individuals these initiatives are designed to help. 
To prevent this, some initiatives are very base-level and don’t actually engage in any conversations that are emotionally charged enough to cause white fragility, when white people have to reckon with and often deny their innate privilege. This looks like reading “To Kill a Mockingbird” over something like “How To Be An Antiracist” to make a curriculum less controversial or “race neutral.” Alternatively, some spaces opt to have white or white-passing groups and a group including Black and Indigenous people and people of color conduct separate workshops. Both of these routes may be helpful in that they are, at the very least, sparking conversation, but they are ultimately ineffective as real vehicles of diversity and inclusion. 
If workplaces or schools choose to talk about race in basic terms to prevent white fragility, once again, the privileged group’s emotions are being valued more than those of the marginalized groups. Moreover, if spaces are separated based on identity — although this does provide a support group for marginalized people — that only reinforces the idea that segregation is OK to make sure everyone is “comfortable.” However, these conversations are not meant to be comfortable and opting for comfort maintains a hierarchical status quo and further divides privileged and marginalized groups.
Along with being ineffective in nature, D&I initiatives tend to celebrate assimilation rather than diversity. When these efforts were first implemented, the nation wasn’t talking about anti-racism and being equal in our differences; the social climate was distinct, and many believed that the only way to achieve racial equality was to assimilate. 
When a person of color walked into predominantly white spaces, there was an unspoken rule to abide by Anglo rules such as speaking formally, dressing in suits and having one’s hair straightened or “professional.” These “norms” are not normal for many groups of people; nonetheless, they were the ones everyone had to follow to be successful in the workplace. By attempting to fit into predominantly white spaces, marginalized groups are faced with the challenge of preserving themselves in a space that doesn’t actually want diversity beyond the label. D&I efforts are driven by quotas and public opinion, but many workspaces and schools do not want diversity — they just want good optics.  
So these D&I initiatives often amount to nothing more than assimilation for groups who are placed in a predominantly white space, then asked to adapt to the culture or die trying. For many members of marginalized groups, “fitting in” comes at the expense of their own cultural identity. Assimilation, according to author and scholar of race Ibram X. Kendi, is just another form of racism that serves to uphold the hierarchy of privilege.
Instead of falling short in D&I efforts by ignoring that inclusion is just assimilation rebranded, schools and workplaces must put to rest these ideas and keep them in the Civil Rights Era they were intended to work in. 
Yes, there should always be an effort to diversify schools and workplaces, but it has to be an effort of diversity that matters beyond optics or quotas. Spaces must be actively looking to include different perspectives in their work in order to be more representative of society today. This also means having tough conversations within these spaces and encouraging difference; accountability and discomfort are often the only ways to yield substantive results on these fronts. Finally, and most importantly, spaces should move away from “inclusive” efforts where people are forced to assimilate to the “cultural norm” and, instead, celebrate differences and empower marginalized groups. 
The well-intentioned initiatives of D&I are outdated and are causing more harm than good — it is time to recognize the double-edged nature of these archaic initiatives and move on.

Los Angeles is full to the brim with culture. Before Manifest Destiny, California was a part of Mexico and many parts of the Latinx culture remain visible to the naked eye. Street names, neighborhoods and beyond all represent the culture that is the foundation of L.A.
There is no shortage of good food to be found within the city limits. Angelenos gather around, below are some of the best Latinx owned eateries in L.A.
La Pupusa Urban Eatery

Equelecua Cuban Vegan Cafe
According to its website, Equelecua Cafe is the first Cuban all-vegan restaurant on the planet. Two inexperienced restaurateurs worked with Cuban-born chef Juito Ortega-Gazo to create a mouth watering menu that is uniquely “Vegano a lo Cubano!” The restaurant is temporarily closed due to the coronavirus but they are still offering take out.
Yelp reviews rave about the authenticity of the menu to Cuban culture. El Cubanaso Sandwich is one of the fan favorites at the restaurant. It’s a classic vegan Cuban sandwich with lechón asa’o, ham with swiss cheese, pickles, mustard and mayo. The sandwich may be the best hangover cure yet to exist!

Versailles
Cuban chef Orlando Garcia opened his first location in 1977 and has dedicated themselves to being the most flavorful Cuban cuisine in town. Since then, the restaurant has expanded to three locations in the L.A. area. Versailles is best known for its signature Versailles Mojo, a marinade created by Garcia.

Los Originales Tacos Arabes de Puebla
A family-owned and operated food truck open Wednesday through Sunday is a gem amid a mostly industrial part of L.A. The tacos are generously piled with meat and all your favorite accessories. Masks and social distancing are required at this food truck. 
Onion, cilantro, salsa verde and a dash of lime all add to the glory of the meal. The eatery also serves quesadillas, molotes and cemita poblanas in a variety of flavors. Tacos Arabes utilizes its social media in an endearing and meaningful way by sharing anecdotes about its family’s history and what inspired its recipes. 
Capuyo Cafe
Capuyo Cafe is Latina-owned business in Boyle Heights dedicate to serving healthy food and organic Mexican coffee. The cafe has all the normal cafe menu items and then some. The menu ranges from espresso to Mexican mochas to drip coffee to the signature Capuyo latte with all-natural Mexican vanilla.  Since the pandemic began, the restaurant has added an outside patio. 
One of the items advertised on its Instagram is a vegan Lavender horchata. Great vegan horchata is hard to come by, but guests swear by it!

Mikaza Nikkei Sushi
Three chefs work to combine their different flavors at Mikaza Nikkei Sushi. Latina chef Elizabeth Valencia told L.A. Taco that there were difficult obstacles to overcome to be a sushi chef. After graduating from California Sushi Academy, Valencia was the head chef at Hama Sushi in Venice. Now she has come together with Miguel Torres and Danny Rodriguez to create genre-defining menu items for Downtown L.A. 
The menu includes ceviches, signature sushi rolls and entrees such as Peruvian cilantro paella, grilled wagyu beef and duck in citrus grapefruit sauce. It’s safe to say the combination of flavors is a unique must-try! The restaurant seats 60-80 on its patio outside to ensure business amid the pandemic.

While many of us roll out of bed in the morning two minutes before our Zoom lecture, ambling to the kitchen in pajamas for a cup of coffee, Thornton School of Music senior Jairus Edwards is already up and exploring his creative side. 
The jazz vocal performance major feels most creative in the morning and takes advantage of this opportunity, spending the time after waking up by meditating and writing down song lyrics. 
“Morning can consist of a lot of writing and meditation to fuel creativity,” Edwards said. “Throughout the day, whatever inspires me, I take notes and write them down on my pad, or if I get melodies in my head, I’ll record them.”
This dedicated process is clearly effective — Edwards, who performs under the name JAiRUS, has a repertoire of groovy singles. 
His identity as an artist is aided by his impeccable style. He is often seen sporting a clean-cut look with a ’70s vibe, block coloring and a knit beanie. No one could ever wear a beanie quite like him. 
“My Way,” JAiRUS’ latest release which came out Sept. 16, is a compelling exploration of the story within the book of Exodus. Beneath soothing melodies and almost ethereal vocals, Edwards crafts a narrative that examines the journey of Moses to free the enslaved from Egypt and calls an audience to follow their dreams — to take inspiration and resolve to do things their way. 
JAiRUS’ dreamy, mellow vocals and lyrics to “My Way” start with “A forward motion, parted through a dead sea of soulless composure seen by God in me / Forward emotions, tears of ambrosia fall runnin’ down streamin’ holes burnin’ in my eyes.” 
Edwards’ impressive display of daily creativity comes as no surprise to friends and creative partners who work closely with him. Since Edwards’ freshman year at USC, he has had a circle of friends who adore him. 
Jordan McClure, a senior majoring in communication and occupational therapy, met Edwards on Somerville Floor in Fluor Tower. The two had an immediate connection, and they became inseparable best friends. 
“He’s caring, he’s understanding, he’s the first person I call if I need something,” McClure said. “Vice versa, if he’s going through something and he needs something, he knows I’m always there for him. All of our deepest darkest secrets, we share with each other.”
The pair are thick as thieves. When Edwards isn’t in full-time artist mode, he and McClure spend their time laying around, watching movies and relaxing with one another.  
“Jairus is fearless … Jairus is fearless,” McClure said. “Jairus is a very unorthodox person. Jairus is someone who does things 100% his way and he’s not somebody that gives into peer pressure. He does what he wants to do and he lives 100% of his truth.” 
Edwards is also close with recent Roski School of Art and Design graduate Caleb Griffin. Griffin and Edwards were brought together by a crush. One of Griffin’s close friends fancied Edwards, and the two met at a Black Student Assembly cookout. 
Griffin and Edwards are usually the quieter two in social settings and know they can depend on another one another when things get hectic. Not only are the pair great friends, but they are both artistically inclined.
“We’ve been able to bounce ideas back and forth about our journeys and how we want them to entwine,” Griffin said. “We want each other to both succeed. So it’s very much if I get put on, he gets put on.” 
Before the release of “My Way,” Griffin shot the promotional images. This wasn’t the first time they worked together, but it was the first time the two worked one on one. The shoot culminated in mutual respect for one another’s art.
Even more exciting than the soulful sound and inspiring message of “My Way” is the promise that it holds of future music from JAiRUS. The artist disclosed that “My Way” is not a stand-alone project, but rather one piece of a larger project that is currently in the works. 
“I just know how powerful music is and how inspiring it is,” Edwards said. “I was given a gift to be able to sing, so being able to share that with other people is my biggest inspiration to do music.”
JAiRUS has a unique knack for commanding the energy of the room without being an overwhelming presence. 
“He is so sure of himself and in his own power,” Griffin said. “He doesn’t have to do a lot to grab people’s attention.”
Prior to the release of “My Way,” JAiRUS accustomed himself to the unfamiliar process of  quarantine music production through the creation and release of several other singles. As many artists can likely relate to, the transition to quarantine made the continuation of creative activity difficult. 
Edwards explained that most of his creative inspiration comes from the regular activities of his day — things he sees and people he interacts with. Quarantine put these things to a halt, and Edwards mentioned a time when creating music was difficult due to a lack of inspiration. However, the pause did not last long enough to prevent JAiRUS from having an artistically fruitful summer. Edwards learned to adapt to the situation and sought out revelations from sources beyond his everyday routine.
As cries for social justice erupted around the United States and throughout the world, JAiRUS was inspired to weave the movements for racial equality into the music he was producing. This new focus helped Edwards hoist himself out of his creative rut and get back into the artistic grind.
“Once I got out of that, I had something to create about and guide my bearings about what I wanted to say,” Edwards said. “And then I got things flowing.” 
JAiRUS’ song “For Colored Girls,” which he released in July, drew inspiration from social justice movements happening around the world but also from the Langston Hughes poem “Song for a Dark Girl.” The process behind the making of “For Colored Girls” exemplified JAiRUS’ dedication to his craft. Though quarantine seemed to have driven creativity into a dead end, Edwards adapted, expanded and began to weave his passions into his songwriting in a more powerful display than ever. 
Edwards’ music evokes a relationship between senses in the softest, most emotional way. His ability to play with feelings is reminiscent of a select few male artists. 
“The thing I like most about his music is that his voice is so rich and soulful that you’re brought along as a listener for this journey,” Griffin said. “It’s very intimate and I think a lot of male artists shy away from intimacy. Obviously we have our Frank Oceans now, but in terms of being able to back that up vocally and sonically is what I enjoy the most.” 
Even as quarantine stretches onward, JAiRUS is hard at work, planning his next release. Listeners can expect to see a larger project from the artist coming soon. As we continue sleeping in and showing up to class with eyes half open, JAiRUS will be up and at ‘em, working toward more new music. To stay up to date with his new music, JAiRUS’ songs and recent releases can be found on Spotify and Apple Music.

HBO Max’s big launch late May meant something for media scholars, I’m sure. What it meant to me was a reminder of a sweet little show I’ve been meaning to get back to once (a) I had the time or (b) my professors understood that I needed an inkling of free time, and that show is “The Sopranos.” 
Whether it’s one of Carmela’s (Edie Falco) outfit and nails pairing, Adriana (Drea de Matteo) telling Christopher (Michael Imperioli) to fuck off or hearing Silvio (Steven Van Zandt) pronounce gabagool, there’s something about “The Sopranos” that almost every viewer will enjoy. 
It’s overdone and boring now to talk about “The Sopranos’” place in the “Golden Age” of television — whichever iteration you want to call it — and how it solidified the longevity of the gangster genre because, frankly, who cares about that beyond a passing thought (the media scholars!). 
At its core, “The Sopranos” doesn’t dig, in my opinion, deep enough into the issues of class and family dynamics that it raises — especially within the Italian American community — beyond how it relates to mafia life. Without taking the camera so you literally see through the eyes of each character, you see the world through their sometimes disturbing image, which makes the most integral character, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), your guide in all this mess. 
Bracco puts her foot into every role, but her defying and timeless performance as Mrs. Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese’s “Goodfellas” brought her onto the gangster-drama map. While quite a few of “The Sopranos” actors were involved in the mob-movie business at one point, those films didn’t confront the mafia with a psychoanalytical lens like “The Sopranos” does. 
Centering the highly masculine, character-driven mafia drama around themes of depression, anxiety and learning how to cope made “The Sopranos” and Bracco’s performance the first meaningful and one of the most successful attempts in television to confront mental health within the context of the show, despite that not being the intention. 
I love a good man-to-man talk, don’t you? At the end of the first season, Tony (James Gandolfini) gathers Silvio, Christopher and Paulie (Tony Sirico) for a chat about the elephant in the room (spoiler! But c’mon this was in 1999), the known fact that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist because Tony doesn’t want them to hear it from “some asshole on the street.” 
“It’s not the worst thing I ever heard,” Paulie says and admits to seeing a therapist himself for issues of heartbreak. Silvio is convinced that it was done with discretion and Christopher storms out of the Bada Bing! without a word but a huff. 
Tony’s mental health is not an issue to be dealt with lightly. It introduces characters to him and sets him up for a hit from one of his own family members and several crises throughout six seasons. And to mention this in the man cave, where business is dealt and strippers are dancing just outside, is an amusing but really compelling confrontation with mental health issues that are inextricable from extreme masculinity. (If you want to learn more about that connection, read our wellness & outreach director’s latest column.)
This extreme is nothing new to Dr. Melfi as she learns more about Tony and his job as a waste management consultant. While she is a formidable opponent for his woes, and often the only voice of reason in his life, she takes flack from all sides because she has taken on a man like him as a patient, and is a woman. 
Bracco really takes what little she is given in the role and runs with it, making our ears perk up whenever we hear her Brooklyn accent appear on screen and immediately picture the modern-wooden office that puts her on equal footing with Tony, a position many people aren’t privy to or don’t survive in for long. Being Italian American herself gives Dr. Melfi a certain rapport with Tony, a sensitive foil to the working-class struggles and aura surrounding Tony and the family’s mafia involvements. 
The show and its plotlines are not immune to systemic problems in portraying women though, as it treats Dr. Melfi as it would any other woman on the show (or in media at the time), with no agency and often the men’s emotional punching bag as well as a victim to violence to show the men’s toughness. 
Call it a symptom of the era, but while the show made strides to keep up with HBO compatriots like the themes of morality in “Six Feet Under” or the analysis of city and street politics in “The Wire,” it can’t be overlooked as a notable and integral moment to push the existing conversation on mental health further. 
The credit for this success should be extracted from the ages-old reverence for “The Sopranos” and supplanted with Bracco’s individual performance and that with Gandolfini. 
What’s great about the issues of the show is that, as viewers, we can refuse to see them going forward. We don’t have to take a narrative at its face and accept its violent masculinity or its subjugation of women because “The Sopranos” was, and should, merely be a moment that, at its time, pushed the boundaries of mental health discussion. 
The show has other credits to it that I haven’t mentioned, but idolization of the show can be dangerous in the way that makes us feel like we have to return to that sort of set-up to get back to “good TV.” But we already have it in shows such as “Bojack Horseman” (in which Bracco makes a guest appearance), “One Day at a Time,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and more, and we can look forward to even better representations of mental illness while cherishing, but not emulating, those past.

USC students and faculty gathered Monday for a live virtual screening of the ten-time award-winning film “Once Upon a River,” a coming-of-age story based on the 2011 novel of the same title by author Bonnie Jo Campbell. The screening was followed by a live Q&A session with screenwriter and director Haroula Rose and actress Kenadi DelaCerna, all hosted by the School of Cinematic Arts. The film depicts the life of main character Margo Crane (Kenadi DelaCerna) as she navigates tragedy and growing up in 1970s rural Michigan. 
After being sexually assaulted and having to face the death of her father, Margo decides to leave her hometown and travel down the Stark River to track down her estranged mother (Lindsay Pulsipher). Along the way, she meets several people, such as an elderly man (John Ashton) who she befriends and gains a familial relationship with. In her journey, she learns about many human concepts, including love and death, and faces the guilt and inner turmoil that stemmed from her father’s passing and mother’s leaving. 
“Adapting a novel, I keep saying, is really deceptively difficult because there’s so much in there that you love that you have to let go of, but ultimately it’s to serve this larger story that’s a new thing. It is what it was and now it’s also its own thing,” Rose said. “[Campbell] was always supportive of that too, her analogy is ‘I gave birth to this thing and raised it, but now you’re marrying it, good luck.’”
Notably, this is the directorial debut for Rose, who decided to direct and produce “Once Upon a River” after having read the novel by Campbell. Rose said she felt so compelled by this story that she contacted Campbell personally and talked about the story with her. After that, Campbell allowed Rose the rights to produce the film and from there, “Once Upon a River” debuted on May 10, 2019 to film audiences across the country. The movie has earned 10 awards and 15 nominations from various film festivals. 
“I just remember we were almost just totally in sync the way we were talking about how the characters should be portrayed, and so it was really amazing that she trusted me to tell this story,” Rose said. “I know she had other offers that … well, I know they had more money and stuff, but I think she trusted this approach better, and so I’m really grateful for that.”
Going alongside Rose’s directorial debut is DelaCerna’s film acting debut as Margo. DelaCerna studied acting and theater for film and television at Douglas Anderson School of Arts as well as The New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts. Currently, she is continuing her studies at Michael Warner Studios. 
“I couldn’t ask for anything better to have this as my first film to work on with such an amazing director, Haroula,” DelaCerna said. “It’s been a journey that I never thought I would have embarked on. We just had such an adventure, and we’re still having an adventure to this day.”
The film takes on a variety of different messages as it shares Margo’s complex and constantly changing situation. Many of the themes center around the way in which Margo experiences and is received by the world around her, particularly because she identifies as a Native American woman. 
“For me [Margo not knowing which tribe she is a part of] is so powerful because I see a lot of Native youth today that struggle to find connections with their culture because of legacies of colonialism,” Q&A moderator, composer and Indigenous advocate Kapena Batista said. “But what’s really interesting, in this kind of weird way, is that I think Margo is probably the most Native woman I’ve ever seen on film.”
A message of empowerment is also clear within the film. Rose sought to convey that the choices of the women within the film were, although painful to make, valid. The audience witnesses this as Margo must choose between living the more white-washed, suburban lifestyle with her estranged mother or returning to the home she created with her father figure, Smoke. 
“I do think this film is about how you still have control over your life, and you can be that empowered woman that you see other people being, and that’s a big thing that I get from this story,” DelaCerna said. “Life moves on, like the river does. That’s kind of how I see it, and you can continue going, continue flowing through life and changing.”
Another significant detail of the film is how Margo is presented as a character of color. The novel hinted at Margo being Native American, so in the adaptation, Rose decided to lean into this description. Although she is clearly shown to be Native American in the film, Rose also made a point of not concentrating Margo’s character too heavily on this identity so she can properly represent Native American women as people with human experiences.
“In terms of telling a story about Indigenous people, I really wanted to have the right partners, so I would seek out this casting director and one of my executive producers and talk to a lot of people just to make sure, [I] have other eyes on it,” Rose said. “But at the end of the day, it feels like once you’re telling something that is an authentic, human story, it resonates everywhere … the idea that yes, she’s Native, but also, it’s not about that.”
This film was impactful for many in how it told such a complex and tragic yet hopeful story that anyone could relate to in some way. 
“It was this fantastic journey and story of so many people, and I’m just still overwhelmed seeing it again for a second time,” Batista said. “I wanted to thank you two for creating such a beautiful piece of art.”

What began as a fall semester with no signs of whether the USC football team would play is now an anticipatory countdown to a shortened Pac-12 season. Let’s look back at what was left off in the spring and from last season.
The Trojans had an up-and-down 2019 campaign. They lost half of their first six games but proceeded to go 5-1 for the remainder of the season. This secured a spot in the Holiday Bowl, but the Trojans lost 49-24 to No. 16 Iowa.
It was a disappointing end to an odd season where head coach Clay Helton consistently was on the hot seat and freshman Kedon Slovis took over as quarterback after J.T. Daniels suffered a season-ending injury in the first game. 
However, the new season awaits and with that comes new expectations. The Trojans will be without at least six players from their 2019 campaign. Wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., defensive lineman Christian Rector, linebacker John Houston Jr. and offensive tackles Drew Richmond and Austin Jackson all went on to the NFL, while linebacker Jordan Iosefa is out indefinitely with a dislocated kneecap.
Two players have also decided to opt out this season, though it remains to be seen whether they will reverse their decision after the Pac-12’s announcement to return: Defensive lineman Jay Tufele, who is projected to be a first-round pick, declared for the draft, and left guard Alijah Vera-Tucker, a second-team All-Pac-12 member last season, also declared for the draft.
There will be challenges at the offensive line with Jackson and Vera-Tucker gone, as both held prominent roles in protecting Slovis. According to the Los Angeles Times, Slovis spoke with Vera-Tucker about a possible return but chose not to pressure him. 
Even with these departures, the Trojans still have the potential for a high-powered offense with Slovis as signal-caller once again. He had an outstanding first year with 30 touchdown passes and 3,502 yards. His Achilles heel, however, was turnovers. He had eight fumbles and nine interceptions, and with a new-look offensive line, this will be something to watch.
Nevertheless, last season’s performance put Slovis on the watchlist for the Heisman Trophy.
Along with Slovis, redshirt senior Vavae Malepeai and senior Stephen Carr are two dynamic running backs who will be returning this year. 
Malepeai led the Trojans in rushing yards with 503 and six touchdowns. A patient and powerful runner, Malepeai has the field vision that will be an important aspect of the Trojan running game. 
Carr was second in rushing for the Trojans last season with 396 yards and five touchdowns. He provides the lightning to Malepeai’s thunder, with elusive and agile running that can juke defenders out of their cleats. He also had the fifth-most receiving yards on the team last season with 143. Redshirt sophomore tailback Markese Stepp is expected to pick up the momentum lost after an ankle injury last season, logging more than 300 rushing yards in his seven game appearances in 2019.  
USC’s backs are also capable pass blockers, which may be more in play without Vera-Tucker and Jackson. However, there’s more to look out for from the Trojans’ offense than Malepeai, Carr and Stepp, as the team’s wide receiving corps is one of the nation’s best. 
Junior wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is set to pick up Pittman’s load. St. Brown caught 77 passes with six touchdowns and 1,042 yards last season and is expected to be a huge part of the offense. Helton told the Times he believes St. Brown will “separate himself among other receivers in this country.”
St. Brown is joined by two more exceptional returning receivers — redshirt senior Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Drake London. Vaughns racked up nearly 1,000 receiving yards along with six touchdowns. London brought in 567 yards and five touchdowns in his freshman year. 
Both receivers alongside St. Brown have the ability to each notch in 1,000 yards receiving this season off of Slovis’s hand.
On the defensive side, the Trojans will have two of their best safeties returning for another season. Junior Talanoa Hufanga was second on the team last season in tackles behind the departing Houston, and redshirt junior Isaiah Pola-Mao followed in third with 73 tackles while leading the Trojans in interceptions. 
They’ll be joined by two standout linebackers in sophomore Drake Jackson and junior Kana’i Mauga, who are crucial in disrupting and pressuring quarterbacks. 
There is a lot of potential breakout talent for USC this upcoming season, whether it be the potential for a Heisman season from Slovis or the explosive backs and receivers or even a lights out defense under new defensive coordinator Todd Orlando.
The main concern is if the offensive line will be able to hold up without Vera-Tucker and Jackson and if Tufele’s absence will exhaust the defense.
Nonetheless, USC’s fan base can expect some entertaining play with this roster.

Unless you have been living under a rock, odds are you’ve probably heard of “Among Us.” Best described as a game of “Mafia” in space, the game has you and your friends play as a group of spacemen trying to complete tasks. However, some of you are impostors whose objective is to either sabotage the tasks or kill all the crew. The crew must balance between completing their missions, finding the impostors and surviving. 
This game took the world by storm seemingly out of nowhere. It was released back in 2018 and for the first six months had an average player base of 8.2 people. Now, it has peaked with 438,524 players on stream and is the most viewed game on Twitch. The game has found success even among those who are not usually interested in video games, being used in social events all around the world. 
With such a widespread appeal, why are there no official tournaments for it?
I say “official” because there are already a lot of amateur tournaments. One quick Google search will reveal dozens of opportunities to join one. Of course, everything about them pales in comparison to professional tournaments. Since none are being held, people have no alternative but to join the shoddy championships. 
A lot of people think it is because “Among Us” is not a competitive game. Because of that, it would be hard to formulate rules around it and thus create tournaments. But like I just said, tournaments already are being held, and they show it is possible to formulate rules and regulations around this game. 
The problem is that the “skill ceiling cap” is too low and too inconsistent. There is not a surefire method to measure skill and almost all the players have a similar level of ability independent of how many hours they pour in. While there are tactics, there is no set strategy to employ in the game. Luck also plays a big factor, which makes it even more difficult for people to become highly skilled at the game. In other words, it is a “casual-friendly” game, which is why it’s so popular. 
The esports industry should incorporate more of these “casual-friendly” games to make it more accessible.
This is not a new discussion. Thanks to the pandemic, not only have more people become interested in video games, but every industry has also reviewed their practices to make them more flexible. 
Online learning, working from home, remote projects — all of these things were refined because of the coronavirus. For esports, adapting meant decentralizing tournaments while at the same time maintaining the strict regulations and sponsorship participation, which makes now the perfect time to introduce “casual-friendly” tournaments.
Ideally, it could work like this: Tournaments are created by streamers or small organizations and sponsored by bigger esports companies. These larger companies would, in turn, make sure the tournament has rigorous standards and get in touch with sponsors. Then, once the sponsors are secured, the tournament can be held online and streamed at the same time. 
This plan relies on the mechanisms created during the pandemic and would benefit all parties involved. Streamers would gain higher recognition and money from hosting these tournaments, esports companies would not have to worry about hosting the in-person tournaments themselves and sponsors would have more security on their investments while gaining opportunities to reach new markets. 
Of course, that is not to say that they should be a permanent addition. One look at “Fall Guys” is enough to see that these popularity spikes are hard to sustain. Maybe by next month, a new game will have taken the place of “Among Us,” and the once-thriving player base will be reduced to its initial numbers. But the space allocated for casual-friendly gaming tournaments should remain. 
Not every casual game should have a competitive scene, either. While various factors separate “Among Us” from highly competitive games, it is undeniable that players need some skill to master it. The game is full of complex mechanics, some of which vary depending on which map you are on. 
To properly understand them, you must have extensive knowledge of how the game works. A player must also master argumentation since that is essential to the game. Depending on how well you manage to defend your case, you might end up “killed” by the rest of the crewmates. Sure, there are all the issues I mentioned earlier, but “Among Us” is a good example of what kind of casual games should be incorporated into the competitive scene: easily accessible, yet requiring some skill. 
It is also important to understand that these tournaments would not have a large prize pool or anything close to the size actual esports tournaments often boast. But compared to amateur tournaments, the payout would still be considerably larger. Let’s take, for example, a “Super Smash Bros. Melee” tournament organized by Twitch streamer Ludwig. It followed a plan similar to the one I described previously, with a company sponsoring a streamer’s tourney. The total prize pool was $25,001, a mere 10% of the lowest prize pool recorded in an esports tournament, “Blizzcon 2014 (Hearthstone).” Even so, that pool towers over every public amateur “Among Us” championship available, with most of them having a prize pool of $100. And that, of course, helps in achieving the final goal of expanded accessibility. 
But why is accessibility important in the first place?
If esports is no longer something only highly skilled players can participate in, even if they still retain the de-facto control of the scene, more people will congregate to it, which can then increase diversity in the scene. 
The second way we can look at accessibility is through the eyes of esports companies. By increasing accessibility, esports harnesses more household support. Tournaments would no longer be only populated by highly trained athletes but also by regular, relatable players. This, in turn, leads to average households growing more familiarized with esports and building trust with the industry, as they know someone who participates in these tournaments. In other words, it allows the esports industry to not only secure new markets but also gain a more widespread popular support, something essential for a business to grow.
Ultimately, casual-friendly tournaments prove beneficial for everyone involved. From the sponsors to the companies to even the players, everyone would gain something from this plan. Even if there wasn’t an entire tournament dedicated to this type of game, there should still be an incorporation of casual games into the esports scene because they compose the great majority of video games out there. 
While I said that not every game is fit for a competitive scene, it seems wrong that only a handful of them are deemed “competitive enough” for esports. If we try to expand the scope of the industry while maintaining its positive aspects, the benefit of more accessibility will be worth it.
