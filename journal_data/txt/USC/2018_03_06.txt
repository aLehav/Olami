Photo from USC News Making money · Through USC Senior Vice President for Advancement Albert R. Checcio’s work with Campaign for USC, the University has raised more than $6.6 billion, surpassing previous goals.
USC Senior Vice President for Advancement Albert R. Checcio announced he will be retiring June 30, after eight years at the University.
Since he first began working at the University in 2010, Checcio has supervised Campaign for USC – the largest fundraising campaign to be held by an institution of higher education – since before its official launch in 2011. Checcio was able to surpass his $6 billion goal by raising $6.6 billion nearly 18 months in advance, according to a press release. The campaign continues to receive support from the USC community.
“Mr. Checcio has been instrumental in the continued growth of USC through the numerous transformative gifts that have forever altered the landscape of our University,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias told USC News. “He has pursued a highly tactical fundraising plan, while strengthening our commitment to professionalism throughout his entire department.”
Under Checcio’s management, the Campaign for USC received more than 365,000 contributions, according to USC News. These contributions included $374 million for endowed student scholarships and fellowships, $1.3 billion for health sciences and $1.6 billion for faculty positions and research endowments.
Checcio said in an email to the Daily Trojan that the greatest contribution he made to the University was “professionalizing the advancement program by establishing industry best practices and recruiting very talented people.”
Checcio’s work with Campaign for USC has aided $700 million for the creation of USC Village and supported the $270 million renovations for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Recently, there has also been greater participation among different members of the alumni network. Two-thirds of the gifted money were from non-USC alumni who supported the University’s mission. With the growing total, $2.3 billion were donated by alumni and $2 billion by the parents of USC students.
“As he and his family move forward, so does USC Advancement, and we are eager to build on the solid fundraising foundation he has built for our Trojan Family,” Nikias told USC News. “Our campaign has already achieved its original goal, and we have extended it for five more years. Our success — and the impact it has on our work for generations to come — will always have its roots in Mr. Checcio’s dedication and foresight.”
As Checcio moves forward with his retirement plan, he said he hopes that USC’s academic ascent will continue and the University will become firmly established and recognized as one of the top 10 universities in the United States.

Yuwei Xi | Daily TrojanAddressing the past · Senator Preston Fregia, spearheaded the movement to change the name of VKC in a petition he published on March 1.
Senator Preston Fregia and Senator-elect Michaela Murphy presented a resolution at the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday to address concerns regarding the name of the Von KleinSmid Center. 
The proposed resolution would create a task force comprising students, administrators and alumni who would decide the best way to address the connotations of the building’s name and how it threatens USC’s mission for diversity and inclusion on campus. 
The building is named after Rufus Von KleinSmid, the fifth president of USC, who was an active supporter of the eugenics movement in the United States. Von KleinSmid co-founded the Human Betterment Foundation, a eugenics organization in Pasadena.
Fregia spearheaded this campaign to rename the building and created a petition on March 1 advocating for the name change, which had garnered 502 signatures at the time of publication. However, there has been some resistance to the initiative, according to Fregia.
“Ever since this petition has gone live, I have received a multitude of death threats pouring into my emails and my messages,” he said. “People who understood VKC and what he stood for do not like someone challenging that power.”
As justification for the task force, Murphy said Von KleinSmid  had engaged in questionable behavior during his time as president of the University. 
“During his tenure as president of USC, Dr. Rufus Von KleinSmid both withheld transcripts to colleges enrolling Japanese-American students after being released from internment camps and donated to national eugenic groups who advocated for sterilization in legislative policies,” Murphy said.
Senator Noah Silver noted that the resolution does not call for specific action in changing the name, but merely for the establishment of a task force. 
“I’m wondering if there is a reason why in the actionable part of the resolution, it is not explicitly called for the name to be changed,” Silver said. “It seems to me that the task force may be created and the administration may determine that they do not need to change the name of the center.” 
Murphy acknowledged the concern, but emphasized that USG must allow for dialogue to occur between the administration and USG and not to be too forceful at the outset. Murphy also said that it is unclear whether legal hurdles will hinder the renaming of VKC.
“What we wanted to make a point of was that there was a need for these communications and  conversations to happen, to open that door with this task force,” Murphy said. “This is very much a first step.”
Fregia acknowledged that the resolution is largely symbolic, but emphasized that it has the potential to inspire more student activism.
“The most important aspect of this resolution is that this is now the student body taking a stand,” Fregia said. “I think that what everyone can do going forward is organize groups that can go and make rallies, sign petitions, and keep this grassroots movements alive.”
USC Provost Michael Quick addressed the idea of renaming VKC in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan. 
“This could be the topic of an interesting, intellectual conversation about our University’s history,” Quick said in the statement. “I welcome that discussion.”
The Senate also voted 11-0 in favor of an STI testing resolution first introduced in last week’s Senate meeting. The STI testing resolution allocates funds from the student health fee toward subsidizing sexually transmitted infection and sexually transmitted disease tests through Engemann Student Health Center. 
In last week’s meeting, Speaker Pro Tempore Tyler Matheson and Senator Buck Andrews said that the resolution would most likely be altered significantly before the vote on Tuesday. However, the only changes made at the meeting were to the wording of the resolution.

USC freshman wide receiver Joseph Lewis pleaded not guilty Tuesday at his arraignment hearing in Los Angeles to five misdemeanor charges regarding two domestic violence allegations. 
Lewis was arrested last month and was charged on three counts of domestic battery with an injury, a count of domestic battery without an injury and a count for false imprisonment for alleged attacks on Feb. 5 and Feb. 11. 
Lewis will return to court on March 27 for a pretrial hearing. He was freed on his “own recognizance” and was not required to post the $50,000 bail after his February arrest. Instead, he only had to promise in writing to appear in court for all further proceedings.
The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office declined to file felony charges against Lewis, and his case was referred instead to the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office, which filed the misdemeanor charges against him. 
Lewis continues to be suspended from all football-related activities at USC, University officials confirmed.
“USC takes all reports of domestic abuse seriously and is cooperating fully with the law enforcement investigation,” the University said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “While this student code of conduct issue is being investigated, the student has been suspended from all football-related activities. Student disciplinary records and student conduct proceedings are confidential at USC and protected by law.”

Ling Luo | Daily TrojanTalking politics · Anthony Scaramucci, former communications director for the Trump White House, spoke at the Unruh Institute of Politics Tuesday.
He was joined by Unruh Institute of Politics Director Robert Shrum to discuss the current state of American politics, his experience on President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, his political views and his latest comments on the White House staff’s morale.
Scaramucci, commonly referred to as “the Mooch,” formerly served as Trump’s communications director and worked as a financier and entrepreneur before entering politics. 
Shrum started the conversation on a humorous note, mentioning Scaramucci’s brief 10-day stint as communications director. 
“I empathize with you because I worked with Jimmy Carter for 10 days,” Shrum said. 
Scaramucci jokingly disagreed and noted that it would be 11 days, if a person bothered counting the days with their hands. But he acknowledged that after entering the role, he realized it wasn’t suitable for his honest personality. The pressure dawned on him after his first press conference.
In his self-introduction to the audience, Scaramucci spoke about his childhood in a blue-collar town, and his disengagement from the working class as he climbed the professional ladder after attending Harvard Law School and working at Goldman Sachs. 
His experience on the Trump campaign allowed him to reconnect with working class people and understand what was important to them.
“It was like a wake-up call,” Scaramucci said. “What was being said to me was desperational. What was being said to me was about economic loss, factories closing down … Once I did 26 Donald Trump rallies and two Bernie Sanders rallies, then it dawned on me that [Trump] had a good shot to win.” 
Shrum brought up how Scaramucci recently made headlines last week regarding his comments about the White House staff and their declining morale under the leadership of General John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff. He predicted that more staff would leave following the departure of Hope Hicks, Trump’s latest communications director.
“I said those things publicly because it’s so obvious — it’s the secret that’s not so secret,” he said. “You’re being underserved by your government, so we have to fix it … I’m talking about [Kelly’s] operational style of management. And if he’s not going to change it, then we have to make a change.” 
Scaramucci openly criticized both the Democratic and Republican parties for the “establishment” behavior in Washington and Congress’ inability to pass significant legislation on issues the American people care about. 
“All my Republican friends are going to be mad at me,” Scaramucci said, addressing the Republican party’s failure to pass health care reform. “They voted 268 times — repeal and replace, repeal and replace — they had seven and a half years to come up with a healthcare plan.” 
However, Scaramucci acknowledged that he holds fiscally conservative yet socially inclusive views and praised certain aspects of the Republican tax plan, like the corporate tax cut. Though he no longer works for Trump, Scaramucci constantly emphasized his respect for the president and partially attributes the administration’s inaction to the deadlock in Congress. 
“I think he’s very human,” Scaramucci said, when asked about Trump’s perceived lack of empathy toward the Parkland, Fla. shooting survivors. “He’s in the room with people who might not like him; he’s in the room with people who have different views on gun control … The guy is not the ogre and the two-dimensional person they make him out to be.” 
Yet, he noted how Trump also has shortcomings the president should address, such as his vocal criticism of the media and his failure to denounce the violent actions of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va. 
His remarks led to questions about whether he ever planned to run for office, which he admitted would be impossible for him as a Republican in New York, an overwhelmingly blue state.
But some students, like Stephanie Corrigan, a junior majoring in political science, thought otherwise of Scaramucci’s persona. 
“I felt like he was very much the quintessential politician, like he knew how to work the crowd,” Corrigan said. “He was able to be funny and make people laugh, which definitely seemed to work in his favor. I wouldn’t be surprised if he ultimately ended up running for something.”
To conclude the discussion, Scaramucci ended with a sentiment of inclusion and progress. 
“We have to create social progress, so we have to call each other out and make each other aware of these issues, and make sure that each of us know that whatever our skin color, our sexual orientation, our religious orientation — that we’re all the same,” he said. “We want the same things and we’re all good people.”

Tuition increases are common practice in colleges around the country. Annually, every school increases the cost of attendance. These tuition increases are to account for inflation, to fund projects and to tackle important issues. With a tuition increase of $1,872, or 3.5 percent, USC’s 2018-19 school year tuition will be $55,320. 
The rate of inflation for the United States dollar is projected to be 2.38 percent, meaning that the upcoming tuition hike, while low compared to years past, will give USC more money to work with in the next academic year. Rather than add to the paychecks of faculty and administrators, USC said it will be adding to its financial aid pool, one of the largest in the nation. 
So, in other words, USC is raising tuition in order to help students with the high cost of tuition. Wouldn’t it make more sense to charge everyone less and save all the trouble? Regardless, there are many ways USC can use its increased funds to support the current student body as well as incoming classes. Since current students will be asked to pay more, they too deserve to see tangible, added benefits to their university life. While changes to financial aid policy can certainly benefit students looking forward, USC should first and foremost be focusing on the best interest of its current paying students. 
It’s a similar concept to a taxation vote in Congress: Proposed tax increases or decreases are presented alongside a budget so our representatives can vote not only on the tax, but also on where that tax money is going or what department that money is being cut from. We don’t have that at USC. We are being handed a new bill with no say in where that money goes. 
The possibilities for how USC can aid its current students are endless: Some suggestions may include paying for L.A. METRO passes or sponsoring complimentary shuttles to and from the airport during break weeks. 
The bottom line is that each group of students may have different priorities for how USC should spend their tuition money. As such, USC would benefit from polling the student body and issuing a survey asking students what they want to see improved at the University. There are probably dozens of improvements students want that the faculty isn’t the slightest bit aware of, merely because they have never bothered to ask. Since the students and their families are the ones paying, they ought to be able to make reasonable requests for what should be done with their money. The University’s priority needs to be its current tuition-paying students.
While a 3.5 percent tuition increase doesn’t seem like much, a closer look reveals just how much more money the University will be gaining next academic year. According to University statistics, one-third of USC students receive no aid, meaning they pay full tuition. From these 6,300 students alone, USC will receive almost an extra $12 million next year. This is a conservative estimate because of the two-thirds of students who do receive some form of aid from the school, most of which are still paying some or almost all tuition. 
The University maintains that full tuition only covers 78 percent of the total cost of instruction, and the average cost of attendance  — which includes housing and fees — covers just 57 percent. According to the University then, it costs them $68,523 to educate a single student. The University also claims it costs them $29,824 per student just for living expenses. That doesn’t seem accurate. Just to put that into perspective, it costs the government on average of $10,000 per year to send a child through public school, and as high as $18,000. So does it make sense that a private university spends $68,523, room and board services aside? 
Of course, there is no denying that expanding the financial aid pool to benefit future students is an effective use of the new incoming funds. But with the tens of millions of dollars USC will have to budget  the next academic year, a small portion can be used to benefit current students — those who pay into this fund. After all, in order to give more, the University needs to take more. So perhaps instead of taking from current students and giving it to future ones, USC can continue to take, but enact programs that benefit both the recipients of future financial aid as well as the current student body.

Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
Since I came to USC four years ago, tuition has increased by a whopping 16 percent — four times the inflation rate. When I was a freshman, the sticker price of tuition for the 2014-15 school year was $47,562. Now, according to the USC Schedule of Classes, it’s $55,320. 
But if USC is concerned about its rising cost of attendance — one that is already extraordinarily high — then it’s not communicating that to students. Current students were not even formally notified by USC of next year’s tuition increases; instead, it was hidden in the USC Schedule of Classes for prospective students. To students, that institutional silence speaks volumes. But the issue of transparency obfuscates the much more pressing and concerning issue of faithfully rising tuition rates: The increases are significant, and the increases have been increasing — though it’s worth mentioning that next year’s tuition increase is lower than last year’s tuition increase — and students should not simply be forced to accept them.
USC stated that the increased money brought in by raising tuition would go toward offering more financial aid. However, students were not provided with any specifics regarding how financial aid would be updated or where the rest of their tuition dollars would be allocated. 
Each year, when tuition increases again, there is a sense that this is urgent, necessary and temporary. But if the tuition rate has increased over the past 10 years at 3 to 4 percent annually, that is not a small or linear increase. Instead, administrators and students must be faced with the reality that it amounts to an unsustainable ballooning of the cost of attendance.
As previously mentioned, USC’s biggest argument in favor of raising tuition is that it offsets increases in financial aid.  A press release last year when tuition increased reads: “USC keeps tuition increase near historic lows and boosts financial aid.” In theory, this redistributive system — charging sticker prices to wealthy students to allow low-income students to come — is laudable. In fact, it’s an innovative and imaginative solution to the quandary of how to lower barriers for low-income and first-generation students while maintaining high quality faculty, facilities and resources. And if USC’s claim that the offsets to financial aid meant that last year’s tuition increase really only increased the average net price of a USC education by 1 percent is true, then that’s not so bad. But it doesn’t take into account distributional effects; Daily Trojan reporting shows that, in practice, this system can have the effect of squeezing middle class students who feasibly can’t afford tuition, but don’t receive financial aid, either.
Yet, focusing on the distribution of financial aid is ignoring a much bigger problem. Just over the past 10 years, the tuition rate has increased by a mind-blowing 46.7 percent, or $17,627 per year. In sum, 2018 four-year graduates paying full tuition are paying over $70,000 more for their undergraduate education compared to four-year graduates paying full tuition just 10 years ago. That difference is more than what the median Los Angeles County household earns in an entire year — and it isn’t all accounted for by increased financial aid.
Students are left scrambling to understand why tuition is increasing at four times the cost of inflation, especially with USC’s robust fundraising efforts. President C. L. Max Nikias’s Campaign for USC set the shockingly ambitious goal to raise $6 billion for the University, and completed its goal 18 months ahead of schedule. The University earned the fifth-highest total in cash gifts in 2017 among all other universities, according to the Council for Aid to Education. So the University is experiencing a significant cash inflow, but it is still raising tuition. 
While it’s unclear what exactly tuition increases fund, USC News reports that USC donor fundraising goes toward financing the University endowment, research and new buildings. To anyone that has stepped on campus just five years ago, USC’s commitment to buildings is clear — take the new and formidable $700 million USC Village, as well as new academic buildings Fertitta Hall and Popovich Hall. 
It’s nice to be at a beautiful university, but it’s time for USC to ask itself what kind of institution it wants to be. USC’s place in the top 10 list of U.S. News and World Report’s Most Expensive Schools list; the U.S. News and World Report also ranks USC No. 22 nationally, but No. 40 for “Best Value Schools.” And while the value of a USC degree can still outweigh a sticker price of over $200,000, the University needs to draw a line in the sand — at which threshold will it decide to stop increasing tuition by thousands of dollars each year? 
This is where students need to step in and make our priorities known. We already have a beautiful and functional campus. What we need is a more equitable institution that makes its consideration of students’ financial burdens clear.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
In art, there are no rules. French Dadaist Marcel Duchamp mounted a bicycle wheel on a wooden stool and called it readymade art; photographer Andres Serrano submerged a crucifix in a basin of his own urine; performance artist Chris Burden asked his friend to shoot him with a .22 rifle in the middle of a gallery. The art world remembers the renegades and dissidents. But even within its own realm, art is singularly self-aware. 
Instead of getting angry, artists get even. Instead of lamenting society’s shortcomings, artists brazenly confront those responsible. Out of this heterodox mindset came the movement of institutional critique, a response to the institutions and industries that control art. 
Think of it this way: How many times have you snidely thought, “I could have done that,” while browsing a modern art exhibition? True, you or any toddler could splatter paint on a canvas or pull Burden’s trigger, but the point is you didn’t because you didn’t think of it first. Further, whatever comparable artworks you may have created in your lifetime weren’t legitimized by the physical spaces of the gallery nor by the institutions of museums themselves. And in the end, what makes art art is the aesthetic, cultural and institutional space it occupies. A jar of piss is worthless in Serrano’s basement but worth thousands in a museum because certain powerful people deemed it so. 
The inherent role of politics in art has long been debated. The way I see it, while not always overtly propagandistic, every piece of art is a demonstration of power — whether on the part of the artist, on an institutional level or in the way it is publicly interpreted. Through institutional critique, artists attempted to flip this narrative. Fighting back against the art institution, which had come to be perceived as a space of “cultural confinement,” they sought to vilify the principles and power structures behind the distribution of art and ideas. 
Contemporary artist Hans Haacke tried to display documentation of the business dealings between one of New York City’s biggest slum landlords with wealthy art officials in an exhibition that was abruptly canceled for artistic impropriety by the Guggenheim’s director. 
In what I regard as one of the most wantonly empowering acts of feminism despite the controversy it inspired, performance artist Andrea Fraser distributed several copies of a DVD documenting her sexual encounter with an art collector who had paid her a significant sum of money not for sex but to participate in her artwork. Her performance was more than a sex tape — it critiqued the power structures of the art world which, Fraser argued, are already exploitative and resemble prostitution. 
Art did what it always does — accentuate injustices, propose alternatives and push for a better future — and it worked. However radical their projects may have seemed, these renegade artists set out to fix the art world by calling out its faults through their practices. The critiques they made were consequently absorbed by art institutions and lauded by the very power structures they once denounced. Nearly 40 years after the inception of such works, Fraser wrote in an essay in Artforum that “the practices now associated with ‘institutional critique’ have for many come to seem, well, institutionalized.” 
But why stop with the relatively microcosmic art world? My hope is that other rebels, marginalized groups and free thinkers will follow suit by pushing their respective sectors to improve their conditions. The practice of institutional critique as a tool for self-examination and enhancement is extremely valuable and applicable to all areas of broader society.
As with all social and artistic movements, the iconoclasts arise from the margins. We decry the shortcomings of the institutions we live under — education equality, gun control, misogyny, racism — but through art, we know that the very critiques of these grievances themselves can be more than a peripheral chorus of dissenting voices: They can become parts of the institution and integrated into our culture. There may very well come a time when, just as Haacke and Fraser were acquiesced into the institution they ridiculed, the student activists of Parkland, Fla., and the women of Time’s Up will reconcile with a greater institution that presently undermines them. 
From artists, we can learn to question everything, to never take anything at face value, to be our own internal watchdogs, to fearlessly challenge the institutions we unwittingly live under, to force them to work for us as they should. Taking advantage of the lawlessness and freedoms of the art world, artists are forcing us to confront how we can do better and paving paths toward better futures. It’s up to our bureaucrats, leaders and politicians to follow their lead.

Photo courtesy of Ryan VeneziaWeathering the storm · The Hurricane Heist tells the story of a heist being pulled off in the middle of a hurricane. Director Rob Cohen has worked on movies such as The Fast and the Furious and xXx.
With over 25 credits to his name, including The Fast and the Furious and xXx: State of the Union, director Rob Cohen returns to the silver screen with The Hurricane Heist, a thrilling action movie about a multimillion-dollar heist that occurs in the midst of a category-5 hurricane. The film is an addition to Cohen’s long list of action movies, a genre he came to love during his brief stint with Miami Vice.
“When I got to direct that show, with its guns, cool clothes, tough guys, beautiful women and fast cars, I fell in love with the genre and from that point on my heroes became guys like Walter Hill,” Cohen said.
Despite the glamorous allure of the genre, however, Cohen made clear that at the core of The Hurricane Heist was a potent message about the dangerous implications of climate change. Though the film began production in 2016, prior to last year’s tragic string of hurricanes, Cohen knew from the start that he wanted the film’s political undertones to be evident.
“In creating the character of the meteorologist, I really wanted to him to say, in no uncertain terms, that climate change is why these hurricanes are so bad and they’re going to get worse if we don’t do something,” Cohen said. “This is more important to say it now than in any other time in history; if you can get people to think about these issues through an action movie, then so be it.”
Like its underlying message, The Hurricane Heist embodies darkness in its visuals, the inspiration for which came to Cohen through footage of real hurricanes. The chaotic natural atmosphere, though stylistically appropriate, posed challenges for the actors on set. 
“I said to the actors when I hired them that what they were reading was what I was going to do onscreen,” Cohen said. “I said, ‘If you accept this part, just know that you’re going to go to work every day and you’re going to be windblown, wind-burned, wet to your core, cold, miserable, but you’re going to be able to create a really memorable character.’”
Cohen also said that he was most proud of the 12-minute truck sequences that constitute the climax of the film: “That was really balls to the wall to shoot,” he chuckled.
The challenges of the action-packed shoot, however, were part of a larger learning experience for Cohen, who approaches each film with the curiosity of a student. 
“I specifically take on projects that will stretch me,” he said. “What’s evolved for me in my filmmaking process is just the feeling that I want to push myself and keep evolving and keep being a pupil of the discipline and process of creating.”
Regarding the current state of the entertainment industry, Cohen remarked that he was happy to see the #MeToo movement take place. 
“To see these guys who are widely known as practitioners of power politics and sex be outed was good,” Cohen said. “Now, these issues are so well-documented that a lot of people who might have that proclivity [to harass] will not give into it because they know they will be finished as they should be.”
Cohen offered surprising advice for aspiring filmmakers: Don’t watch movies. 
“Go live your life,” Cohen said. “You can tell the difference between people who make movies that are regurgitations of other movies and people who come to films with a great deal of originality. I urge filmmakers to spend their time traveling, learning, reading rather than watching and trying to remember how this guy did a tracking shot in 1943.”
The Hurricane Heist is slated for release on Friday.

Photo courtesy of IFC FilmsFallen leader · (From left to right) Steve Buscemi plays Nikita Krushchev,Adrian McLoughlin plays Joseph Stalin and Jeffrey Tambor plays Georgy Malenkov.
America’s dicey political climate allows for perfect parallels to the stage of Armando Iannucci’s irreverent period satire, The Death of Stalin. Known primarily for his hit HBO television series Veep, Iannucci has a long history of biting satirical projects that reveal the ridiculousness of the political realm. The Death of Stalin is no exception to his signature style, as the film captures the events that unfold after the Soviet Union leader’s unexpected death from a brain hemorrhage. As Joseph Stalin’s presidium scrambles to fill the power vacuum that results from the death of Vladimir Lenin, the film explores the turbulent transition of power in Russia. 
Iannucci leaves his farcical mark on every facet of the film. He sets the tone in the very first scene, where an audience at a Wolfgang Mozart recital is held captive so organizers can record it for Stalin with just the right amount of applause. This scene perfectly introduces the absurdity that is to come in the movie. 
Since the film does not try to replicate a historically accurate depiction of the events, the director is careful to ensure that everyone in the audience, not just the history buffs, can follow the narrative. For instance, with each introduction of a character, Iannucci uses a comical motif in which the video of them entering plays in slow motion as the characters’ names appearing on the screen. These grandiose entrances, reminiscent of reality television, maintain a lightheartedness despite the horrifying nature of the history covered in the film. 
The A-list actors in the cast ensure that the comedy within the film lands perfectly. The movie features a stellar performance by Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev, the conniving yet self-deprecating member of the Soviet committee. Buscemi’s comedic timing in his scenes is unparalleled, making even some of the darkest scenes easy to watch.
Jeffrey Tambor, known for his role in Arrested Development and being recently fired from Amazon’s TV series Transparent after sexual harassment allegations, plays Deputy General Secretary Georgy Malenkov, Stalin’s babbling, unqualified replacement. Tambor’s acting brings an additional layer of absurdity to the film as only a comedian can, with lines like, “kiss my Russian ass” that bring cheap laughs to the film’s depressing moments and  serious political environment.
Though they play fairly minor roles in the movie, Andrea Riseborough and Rupert Friend deliver marvelous portrayals of Stalin’s children, Svetlana and Vasily, respectively. The poised Svetlana and her bratty brother make an extremely memorable duo, beautifully capturing the seemingly contrary grief and relief that accompanies their father’s death. The two siblings certainly feed off each other’s energy, bolstering their performances in the process.
Some criticize Iannucci for his choice to not incorporate Russian accents in the film. However, the unaccented acting underscores the film’s satire. It serves as a constant reminder to the audience that these are actors reconstructing and mocking history, rather than attempting to perfectly replicate the story. This theatrical element of the acting reinforces Iannucci’s satire through a self-aware embrace of the film’s inauthenticity.
Indeed, with The Death of Stalin, Iannucci proves that no period of history is too dark to be made fun of. Iannucci targets the absurdity that exists within a terrifying portion of history, and succeeds. When discussing how he handled the dark themes in an interview with TIME Magazine, Iannucci said, “The first thing I said as we started shooting was that we had to be very respectful to what happened to the people. There’s no comedy there. We just show that for real. We don’t have to comment. The comedy’s all from the senior figures inside the Kremlin.” 
An extremely effective work of satire, the movie has actually been banned in Russia. In the same interview, Iannucci commented, “I knew some people would hate the idea of the film and other people would absolutely love the idea of the film, which is fair enough. That’s true of all films. Actually, from those Russians who’ve seen it, it’s been greeted positively.”
However, Russian authorities have reportedly called the film “ideological warfare,” and are unable to see the project through Iannucci’s eyes. In an age of tense political relations with Russia, especially regarding influence overseas, the inability to accept satire holds problematic implications for the future. Still, regarding the quality of The Death of Stalin, Iannucci’s unmatched ability to blend a history of tragedy with comedy delivers a fresh product that many can embrace.

Sunny Dong | Daily TrojanGet served · Graduate student Alexandra Poletto serves against Pepperdine. She helped the Trojans defeat rival UCLA over the weekend.
Coming off losing three out of four duels against rivals UCLA and Pepperdine, the now 2nd-ranked Women of Troy (5-3) will look to bounce back strong in the East Meets West Challenge this Saturday where they will face LSU, Florida State, Florida International and TCU. 
Despite the adversity they encountered last week, there was a strong sense within the team that adjusting and refocusing will help them in the long run.
“I definitely think that the adversity we’ve gone though can help us in the long run,” junior Terese Cannon said. “We know that we have a huge target on our back this year and it is good to play teams early in the season. I think it is kind of a wake-up call for us.”
Coming off last week’s matches, the message preached by the players and coaches was “do your job.” 
“We need to make sure we take care of our side of the court,” head coach Anna Collier said. “We’ve taken for granted that we’re this great team and haven’t taken care of our own.” 
That message was echoed by Cannon. 
“A lot of the errors we committed were ones that we can fix and we need to focus on our own sides of the court,” she said.
Though the Trojans had a brutal schedule last weekend, this weekend will be just as difficult with all four of the Trojans’ opponents being ranked in the top 20 of the AVCA Coaches’ Rankings. The Trojans will face a No. 9 ranked LSU squad that many consider to be “on the rise” over the last few years, a TCU team that came into the season ranked 20th, No. 13 ranked Florida International and the No. 5 ranked Florida State Seminoles.
Of the four teams, the biggest challenge the Trojans anticipate this week is the 2016 NCAA runner-up Florida State. The 8-0 Seminoles have been on a tear to begin the season and have yet to drop a second set in any of their matches. 
In Florida State, Collier sees an elite squad. 
“Florida State is the UCLA, Pepperdine [and] USC of the east coast,” Collier said.
Last season, Florida State reached the semifinals of the Beach Volleyball Championship Tournament. 
Though the Seminoles have cemented themselves as a national powerhouse, the Trojans are looking forward to the challenge. 
“Florida State is always one of our big rivals of the east coast and I’m excited to play them and the rest of the East Coast schools so that we can get a beat on how they play,” Cannon said. 
The East Meets West Challenge will be played at Manhattan Beach, Calif. on March 10-11. The Trojans will face Florida International on Saturday at 10:30 a.m., and then LSU at 12:30 p.m. The following day, USC will square off against Florida State at noon and finish with TCU at 4 p.m.
Next weekend, the Trojans will travel to Honolulu. In the Outrigger Hawai’i Invitational, they will face off against No. 12 Grand Canyon, No. 3 Hawai’i and Nebraska.

On Monday, the 2018 NFL Scouting Combine (or the “Underwear Olympics”) concluded offering teams a look at this year’s top college prospects.
The combine can be an excellent showcase for players who may have lacked visibility during their college days. Former LSU receiver DJ Chark showed flashes of brilliance in college, but was unable make a lasting impact due to subpar quarterback play. This weekend, he ran a 4.34 40-yard dash, and posted a 40-inch vertical jump. Now, the freakishly athletic and tall (6’4”) wideout should be a first-round pick. 
Chark wasn’t the only player who benefited from running a bunch of drills in Spandex over the weekend. UCF linebacker Shaquem Griffin received a late invite to this year’s Combine, most likely because he’s missing his left hand (it was amputated at age 4 because of a prenatal condition) and scouts weren’t sure if he would ever become an NFL starter as a result. Griffin dispelled those notions in explosive fashion. He benched 225 pounds for 20 reps and ran a 4.38 40, the fastest time for a linebacker since 2003 (if he doesn’t get drafted now, expect a very angrily written column in April). 
While the combine is effective at offering under-the-radar prospects, such as Griffin and Chark, a stage, it’s generally a pretty ineffective way to evaluate talent. Too often NFL scouts fawn over measurables and stats in ignorance of game tape or accomplishments. 
Take, for example, Wyoming’s Josh Allen, the darling of this year’s combine. This weekend, he checked all the boxes of a can’t-miss quarterback prospect. Speed? He ran a 4.75 40, the third-best among signal-callers. Arm strength? Allen threw 70-yard bombs with ease. Size? He measured in at a hulking 6-foot-5, 237 pounds. With his stock rising, and the Browns being heavily rumored to take him at No. 1 overall, scouts and analysts appear to be ignoring a glaring flaw in Allen’s game: He wasn’t very good in college. 
Allen completed just 56.3 percent of his passes for 1,812 yards during his final year, good for 82nd in the nation. He threw 21 interceptions and eclipsed the 300-yard mark just twice over the past two years. Not to mention his team Wyoming competed in the Charmin-soft Mountain West Conference. 
My intention is not to trash Allen. It’s nearly impossible to predict how draft prospects turn out, and he could easily make me eat my words and become a successful NFL quarterback. But picking him over proven winners and prolific college players like USC’s Sam Darnold, Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield and UCLA’s Josh Rosen seems absolutely ludicrous to me. All three played against legitimate competition, posted more impressive numbers and possess experience in big-time games. 
There’s precedent for combine warriors with lackluster college tape failing once they make it to the league. If measurables were true indicators of success, notorious busts Jamarcus Russell (whose arm strength has been compared to Allen’s ) and Ryan Leaf would have been All-Pros, while undersized prospects like Saints’ Drew Brees and the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson would be languishing in the Canadian Football League. 
The overvaluing of combine numbers can hurt players’ stocks in the same way it’s helping Allen skyrocket up draft boards. This year, Oklahoma offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. posted by far the worst 40-yard dash time out of all prospects clocking in at 5.85 seconds and the lowest number of bench reps among offensive linemen with 14. Now, the former surefire first-round draft pick is quickly falling out of favor with analysts. 
After a historically bad performance, it’s fair to ask some questions about Brown Jr.’s athleticism. But talk of him dropping to the fourth round is preposterous. At Oklahoma, he was Big-12 Offensive Lineman of the Year in 2016 and a unanimous All-American in 2017. He was instrumental in helping lead the Sooners to the College Football Playoff, protecting Heisman trophy winner Mayfield’s blindside like a Secret Service agent defends a president. 
Brown’s combine numbers may have been ugly, but he was also the second heaviest and second tallest player in Indianapolis, hampering his ability to jump and run. But those are two things he won’t be doing much of in the NFL. 
“When are you going to watch Orlando Brown run 40 yards down the field?” Mayfield asked in defense of his former teammates. “Never. Look at his film. He gave up zero sacks last year.”
The NFL Combine is good at indicating raw athleticism and strength in college players, but it’s bad at actually predicting a player’s success. Therefore, scouts and analysts should stop acting like it does. Numbers can be deceiving, but game tape never lies.

Ling Luo | Daily TrojanRaking up points · Sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic drives in for a layup against UCLA. He’s averaging 7.5 points per game off the bench.
The USC men’s basketball team fell short by double-digits in its season finale against UCLA last Saturday at the Galen Center, 83-72. A 34-point performance from UCLA All-Pac-12 junior guard Aaron Holiday propelled the Bruins to their fourth consecutive victory over the Trojans. 
“We just needed to be more locked in and play better defense,” said USC senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team Monday. “We’ve watched the tape [from the UCLA game], and we’re aware of what we need to do better going forward.” 
Yet despite the loss, the Trojans did finish the 2017-18 regular season in second place in the Pac-12 conference standings. The second-place conference finish is the highest for the USC basketball program since 2002. 
By finishing near the top of the Pac-12 regular season standings, USC clinched a first-round bye in this week’s Pac-12 Tournament, which will be held in Las Vegas from March 7 to 10. The Trojans will take on either Washington, a No. 7 seed in the tournament, or No. 10 Oregon State in the quarterfinal round on Thursday. 
“It’s a great accomplishment for us to finish second-place in the Pac-12,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said, “And getting that bye is really helpful for our team.[Having the bye] helps save some of our guys’ legs, and it should build up our confidence to play well on Thursday.”
Regardless of the opponent, USC is familiar with both Washington (20-11 overall, 10-8 in Pac-12) and Oregon State. In its Pac-12 season opener on Dec. 29, USC lost to Washington at the Galen Center, 88-81. The Trojans swept Oregon State (15-15, 7-11) in the regular season series between the two teams. USC topped the Beavers at the Galen Center on Feb. 17, 72-59, in a game that saw USC senior guard Elijah Stewart score 28 points. 
“Whichever team we play, they’re both very physical, have great guard play and have really put together some solid seasons,” Enfield said. 
In the eyes of many, the Trojans’ regular season-ending loss to UCLA (20-10, 11-7) put a sting into USC’s hopes of qualifying for the NCAA Tournament for a third consecutive season. Despite being a second place team in the Pac-12, many NCAA Tournament bracket projections have USC as a current bubble team when it comes to qualification. 
In the March 6 version of ESPN’s Bracketology, USC is projected as a No. 11 seed in the NCAA Tournament and is slated for a play-in game against Texas. 
Trojan players and coaches alike feel that the team has already proven itself worthy of qualification for the NCAA Tournament. 
“We can only control what we do on the court,” Enfield said. “We’re very proud of our team and where we are right now: 21 wins, second in the Pac-12 and a chance to go out and compete in Vegas this week.” 
Junior forward Chimezie Metu thinks a strong performance in the Pac-12 Tournament will be essential. 
“I think second place in the Pac-12 should be enough to get you into the NCAA Tournament,” said Metu, who was also named to the All-Pac-12 First Team on Monday. “All that last four in, first four out, whatever. We’re not worried about that. We’re worried about what we have to do.” 
Should the Trojans come away with a victory against either the Huskies or Beavers on Thursday, they will advance to the Pac-12 Tournament semifinal game, which will be held on Friday night at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Within the past 50 years, America’s shifting demographic makeup has led universities to recruit increasingly diverse student bodies and implement inclusive educational programs and social aspects for their student bodies.
Art by Di Wu
These institutions have worked to create a well-rounded student population with students hailing from all walks of life, across racial, socioeconomic, gender and political spectrums. Yet, there is an increasing awareness that diversity and inclusivity should be introduced earlier in childhood development, as primary and secondary institutions should adopt a similar mindset to the collegiate model.
USC has been at the forefront of various diversity initiatives to emphasize diversity and inclusion into daily campus life. In January, for example, USC’s Diversity and Inclusion Awareness Week hosted thought-provoking seminars and wide-ranging discussions for faculty to better address diversity and inclusion in their classrooms. USC also constantly emphasizes its racial diversity and its vibrant international student community.
But, simply discussing the concepts of diversity and inclusion is not enough. USC officials and students must think outside the box to ensure these concepts are valued in the lives of prospective students and individuals from the surrounding South Los Angeles community, specifically focusing on the USC Family of Schools, the 15 schools surrounding the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
Forward thinking is necessary for educators who are teaching young children how to respect those different from them, and this concept should be implemented earlier in the educational process. As a premier research university, USC has the resources to study households, preschools and playgrounds across the Los Angeles area.
These resources should be directed toward introducing the value of diversity as early as possible into a child’s development. USC should involve students and faculty in the disciplines of education, childhood development, economics and public policy to challenge themselves to come up with workable solutions to bring early diversity education into the surrounding community. 
The Department of Education’s 2016 report on the state of racial diversity among public educators reveals that a majority of public school teachers are white, while the racial makeup of classrooms are becoming increasingly diverse. This statistic alone reveals how crucial diversity and inclusion training should be in order for public educators to ensure equal support and access to educational opportunities for students of color.
The website Teaching Tolerance, a project from the Southern Poverty Law Center, it states that teachers should reach out to students in ways that are culturally and linguistically appropriate by examining their inherent biases. “In this era, it’s simply not enough to operate on the axis of color-blindness,” the website writes.
Similarly, it’s especially important to establish this training for teachers and even for parents with children who are most likely attend elementary school with children from diverse backgrounds. Enthusiasm for inclusivity is wonderful, but educational institutions like USC, which has a strong influence over its surrounding communities, should not be satisfied with just four years’ worth of diversity and inclusion exposure provided for a student’s undergraduate experience. Diversity and inclusion must be fostered at a young age to actually impact students’ life experiences.
This concept is exemplified by a statement made by William G. Tierney, the Wilbur-Kieffer Professor of Higher Education at USC Rossier and co-director of the Pullias Center for Higher Education: “Understanding differences is a lifetime event.” 
The earlier this understanding begins, the greater the likelihood that it will have to affect a person’s organizational behavior toward diverse groups later in life. 
True engagement of students and faculty is crucial to promote the importance of diversity and inclusion regardless of race and ethnicity, sexual orientation or political beliefs. USC leads the nation as the one of the most diverse universities, ranked sixth according to Priceonomics. 
It is up to this generation of students and faculty to extend inclusion and diversity principles to young children and their families early in life, whether it be through local mentorship programs or providing research to support increased equity in education. 
With USC’s major role in the South L.A. community and its connections to various primary and secondary schools, the University should strive to introduce its diversity and inclusion initiatives off-campus to positively impact the educational experience of prospective Trojans. USC has the infrastructure in place to make a difference for the community at large. Ensuring diversity on campus is a great first step, but bringing inclusivity to our surrounding communities would be wholly transformative.

When applying to USC, there are a number of things that could aid a student’s chances for admission: active community involvement, a high GPA, strong test scores and, some argue, having a parent who attended USC. 
But measuring the extent to which being a legacy student matters in admission is, like quantifying any single admissions factor, a hazy task. The USC Admissions Blog notes that “…  legacy status is, on its own, not going to be the deciding factor in the evaluation of a student’s application. There are many factors that we are considering when making our decisions, and legacy status is just one part of that.” 
In this vein, elite colleges around the country, including Princeton, Yale, Cornell, Brown and Columbia, have launched plans to collect signatures on petitions that question the fairness of legacy programs this spring semester. 
USC students should be equally critical. 
Still, no matter the degree to which specific legacy programs aid a student’s admission to a particular school, their mere existence as a system is large enough to warrant consequent debate and discussion: U.S. News & World Report found that around three-quarters of the nation’s top 100 universities give some boost in admissions likelihood to the children or relatives of alumni. 
The presence and prevalence of legacy programs represents, for some, a sense of elitism in a system that should be striving for equal access, and, for others, a necessary action to foster and retain support for the school. But the problem, in a sense, lies not so much with the mere existence of legacy programs, as it does with the by-products of them: The students admitted through programs like these tend to be overwhelmingly white and wealthy. 
Legacy programs, then, become a way to further privilege students who are often already quite privileged. 
Many of the programs around the country that support the action of favoring legacy students do so operating under the notion that admitting students with a pre-built connection to the university will increase their future commitment as alumni — these students, and their families, will be even more likely to contribute to the school financially and otherwise. 
It’s not an inherently criminal notion to accept those who might be prone to especially supporting the school — every school should strive to include students who are going to support it — but the assumption that support is somehow limited to money is discriminatory, and excludes those who do not have the means to donate but might want to support their school in other ways. 
Further, the assumption that a longstanding connection to a university inherently creates a proclivity to donate large amounts of money is also flawed. As The Atlantic reports, little evidence suggests that the existence of legacy-preference policies impactfully enhances total alumni giving. In the study that the publication referenced, it is also found that “seven institutions that dropped legacy preferences between 1998 and 2007 did not suffer any serious reductions in alumni giving.”
In trying to search for students with a proclivity to “support” a school, many universities have ended up additionally favoring students who are already likely to be favored, as a result of their socioeconomic status and prior access to education. These are students who can excel on the kinds of benchmarks, like standardized testing and official interviews, that comprise one’s college admissions process and therefore often do not even need the additional leg up they receive if they’re a legacy student.
That said, this unfair preference extends far beyond favoring students with relatives who attended a certain school — which is why USC should strive to admit students from a wider array of economic backgrounds, rather than a larger number of wealthy students, including legacies. As of Fall 2016, 21 percent of undergraduates received pell grants. But given that roughly 16 percent of USC’s Fall 2017 freshmen were legacies, it’s evident that the University is walking the line between representation and tradition.
A 2010 book by Anthony Carnevale and Jeff Strohl, called Rewarding Strivers, reported that: “Seventy percent of students at the nearly 200 “most competitive” colleges (including public universities) came from the top quarter of households by income.” In their book, they also determine that “these richest households are now overrepresented by 43 percent at top colleges.” 
Legacy programs are unfair for whom they aid — but only when they’re aiding those who do not need financial help and who come from economic brackets that, as Carnevale and Strohl find, are already overrepresented at elite institutions. 
Schools and students who want to better equalize “the great equalizer” should look not only to disrupting legacy programs, but also to programs that will change the economic makeup of their schools in other, equally impactful, ways.

Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
Before I wanted to be a writer, and before I wanted to be an opera singer, I fantasized about becoming a ballet dancer. Of all my dreams, including those that never came to fruition, my first one was to dance. I used to watch my sister in ballet lessons when we were children and remember how much she hated it. I would sit with my mother outside the studio while my sister rehearsed and peek in through the window. You could see on her face, as a rambunctious 6-year-old, how much she’d rather be doing anything else than grand-plié’s on the bar with the other young girls. In contrast, my 4-year-old mind thought, “That should be me up there.” 
Last week, the Joffrey Ballet arrived in Los Angeles to begin a brief residency at the Music Center for two separate performances held this month, one in partnership with L.A. Opera in its production of Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice, and another for its own production of Sergei Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet. Under my job title with L.A. Opera, I’m supposed to sit in on various rehearsals and keep my ears perked for stories that can be produced into written and visual content. In other words, what stories do I want to tell for this show? Who specifically do I want to showcase? How does this show relate to what’s going on in the real world? 
In the six months I’ve spent working for the company, I’ve never had a problem developing content. Having come from a musical background, it’s been like second nature. But the addition of the dancers has been a game changer. At every rehearsal I have attended, I’ve been extremely distracted by the elegant movement of the ballerinas, so much so that I’ve barely been able to do my job. Every movement, whether it is properly executed or not, is so mind-blowingly beautiful that I can’t help but put my notes down and just watch. There was a point a few days ago when I forgot where I was — I was so mesmerized by the ballet dancers that, like Orpheus, I, too, felt like I had descended into the Underworld.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
I don’t have the vocabulary to describe the choreography in detail, but from the warm-ups to the formal rehearsals, the dancers’ grace has me inspired. A singer or musician’s discipline is quite different than a dancer’s. A pianist must be conscious not to overexert the hands, or a singer the voice; but the dancer’s body is the vehicle for their art, and they must be conscious of their movements from start to finish, both on and off-stage. One false move or misjudgement in error and catastrophe can arise. And it’s the beauty of their movement, intertwined with risk itself, that makes it so tantalizing to watch. I feel like I missed out on something so special by not taking ballet lessons when I had the chance. But it’s no fault of mine — I begged my mother to put me in ballet classes ever since my sister started. And at risk of playing the blame game, the reason why I never trained formally in ballet is that my mother wouldn’t let me.
As an Iranian-raised woman living in the United States, my mother had very conservative views on gender norms. She thought that as a boy, I should engage in more masculine activities, like competitive sports. Against my will, I was forced to swing bats and punt balls or whatever you call it — the terminology doesn’t matter. Had my mother not been so concerned with my image, as well as what her peers would think should her son engage in an activity not perceived as masculine enough, my life could have turned out very differently. And that’s what upsets me the most. In the end, she was more concerned with me not being perceived as a “sissy” (her words, not mine) than my happiness.
Of course, that isn’t to say I would have stuck with it in the long run, or would have even been good enough to eventually have been accepted to a major dance company. Given my track record, I probably would have given up in a few years. 
However, I don’t think I’d be so sour about the whole situation had it not been for my mom’s internalized homophobia. True, it was the ’90s and discussions about equality weren’t as widely regarded as they are now. But that’s not really an excuse. I clearly had enough passion for ballet if I was begging my mother to put me in ballet classes. Instead, I was set to rot on a sports team with a bunch of straight boys who smelled. And no matter how much time passes, I’ll always feel like I missed out on an opportunity that could have shaped the rest of my life. That’s something I’ll always regret. 
The point isn’t to blame my mother for disregarding my forlorn dreams. But it does make me sad that I’ll never know if I had a talent for dance, because that ship sailed long ago. Perhaps I wouldn’t have had issues with my weight had I trained as a dancer starting in my toddler years. Maybe I could have been good enough to perform professionally. I can’t seem to get the “what ifs” and the “maybes” out of my mind, because even today as I watch the Joffrey dancers work their magic, I think, “That should be me up there.”

The sports competition and music festival Air + Style, which took place at Exposition Park Saturday and Sunday, refused to let rain ruin its parade. 
Tearin’ it up · The two-day Air + Style festival featured world-class athletes and musical acts. Dillon Matthew | Daily Trojan
Olympic gold medalist Shaun White’s pet project, which combines music with snowboarding and skateboarding competitions, celebrated its fourth anniversary with festivities that were bigger and better than before. Air + Style has grown exponentially from a small, under-the-radar festival to an international event with stops in Los Angeles, Sydney and Beijing. 
Despite inclement weather over the weekend, visitors remained buoyant, with help from high-energy headliners DJ Zedd and pop band Phoenix. The diverse lineup also included electronic artists Cashmere Cat, Cut Copy and Mura Masa, rappers DRAM and Gucci Mane and indie pop singers Tinashe, Washed Out and Wet. The inclusion of two stages, a Summer Stage and a Winter Stage, ensured that the loud, thumping music was a consistent background presence throughout the festival grounds. The flashy, dynamic performances, with flickering neon backdrops and larger-than-life screens projecting an array of psychedelic patterns, easily dispelled the gloomy gray fog. 
Coming off the tail end of the 2018 Winter Olympics, interest in the festival’s athletic aspects was especially heightened. This year, the snowboard competition showcased street-style snowboarding inspired by skateboard culture, featuring an urban terrain where world-class competitors such as Francis Jobin, Frank Bourgeois and Kyle Mack exhibited their grace and ease on the slopes, accompanied by peppy commentary. 
A new addition this year to the L.A. location was the skateboard arena, a transition-based concrete skatepark where acclaimed skateboarders such as Greyson Fletcher, Raven Tershy and Tom Schaar pulled off increasingly extreme stunts to raucous applause from the audience. 
The L.A. street art scene is globally recognized, and Air + Style made sure to take advantage of it. Prominent street artists Vyal Reyes, Ricky Watts and Spencer “MAR” Guilburt were invited to paint original murals live in front of audiences. Afterward, visitors posed and snapped pictures in front of the finished paintings, bolstering the event’s Instagram-worthiness. 
Attendees looking to grab a bite to eat from one of the food trucks or vendors were offered myriad options to choose from. Just a few of the dining establishments available included Beyond Burgers, Kogi, Pizzanista, Fat Dragon and West Coast BBQ. Additionally, Beyond Meat and Strictly Vegan Jamaican Cuisine catered to the considerable vegan population and those with dietary restrictions. 
Despite its relative newcomer status, Air + Style has certainly made its mark on the festival scene. The unexpected combination of sports with music, art, food and culture brings together diverse crowds from separate spheres to enjoy an unparalleled experience.

After a month and a half of tournaments and invitationals, the Women of Troy will come back to the confines of the Uytengsu Aquatics Center to face a pair of top 10 teams. Getting back into action after more than a week’s worth of rest, the Trojans will face off against No. 8 UC Irvine on Wednesday and No. 5 Hawai’i the following day.
Senior season · Senior utility player Annika Jensen has scored 13 goals in her 2018 season. Last season, she tallied a total of 18 goals. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
USC has been very successful so far this season, winning 10 of 11 games including top 10 wins against UCLA, Cal and Arizona State. Additionally, the Trojans have racked up double-digit goal totals in six of those matches — maxing out at 21 goals in an early match against Pomona in the Cal Baptist Mini Invitational. Early success has moved the team up a spot in the national rankings and they now stand as the No. 2 women’s water polo team in the nation.
With that being said, the Women of Troy are coming off of their first loss this season. A 9-3 defeat at the hands of top-ranked Stanford marked the Trojans’ first slip-up in what had been an incredibly successful campaign for USC. 
Thankfully, the squad has several favorable assets. First, the water polo season is long and the Trojans will have plenty more games to play and challenges to overcome as 2018 wears on. Furthermore, USC will be able to prove themselves against elite talent this week with the duo of highly ranked teams they are set to take on.
The Trojans have already defeated UC Irvine once this season after a 7-5 victory over the Anteaters during the Triton Invitational in Feb. 10-11. In that match, Irvine freshman standout Tara Prentice notched two of her team-leading 20 season goals. Prentice, along with senior attacker Allie Loomis will provide a strong challenge for the Trojan defense.
While USC hasn’t played against the Rainbow Warriors yet this season, the squad saw their fair share of the Hawai’i team a year ago. Playing against each other three times throughout the 2017 campaign, the Trojans won all three matches. At margins of 13-8, 12-5 and 9-8, USC pulled out wins both in California and Hawai’i. This season, Hawai’i has started off hot with a 12-2 record landing them a spot in the top five in the NCAA rankings.
On the Trojan side, freshman driver Paige Hauschild and senior utility player Annika Jensen look to continue their scoring runs. Hauschild, the Team USA star prodigy, picked up 7 goals over four games in the weekend tourney while the senior leader Jensen scored 8 of her own.
Both players pulled out crucial performances in the team’s last outing at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational and will be critical to the Trojans’ chances this week as well.
In net, USC will likely continue to alternate goaltenders as they have all season long. With senior netminder Victória Chamorro and junior standout Amanda Longan essentially splitting time in net, both should contribute to the team’s effort once again this week. Despite being the goalie in the lineup for the team’s sole loss this season, Longan has managed to play incredibly sharp this season, highlighted by early shutouts against Loyola Marymount and California Baptist.
Both games will begin at 5 p.m. at  the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Wednesday against UC Irvine and Thursday against Hawai’i.

The USC men’s volleyball team will travel down South to take on the UC San Diego Tritons Wednesday. The Trojans have had a tough year so far, bearing a 4-13 overall record and currently riding a daunting six-game losing streak. With a 0-6 record on the road, the Men of Troy will look to break their losing streak against UCSD. 
Ready, set, spike · Freshman setter Chris Hall sets up the ball for a spike from fellow freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis, who has 91 kills in 2018. Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan
Last Thursday, the Trojans faced a tough No. 15 UC Santa Barbara team at home and lost in a four-set match. Junior outside hitters Gianluca Grasso and Jack Wyett continued to lead the offense as they have been all season — both boasted 14 kills. Grasso also showed a dominating defensive effort with 11 digs, the most on the team. Freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis made an impact with 11 kills and one block. Senior setter Gert Lisha ran the offense with 30 assists, and freshman setter Chris Hall contributed 18. 
For UCSB, sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders and junior outside hitter Corey Chavers led their offense with 21 and 15 kills, respectively. Chavers also contributed seven blocks and junior middle blocker Connor Jake tallied six. Overall, the Trojans made too many errors. While they had more assists, digs, aces and kills, their 20 errors against UCSB’s 11 was ultimately the Trojans’ downfall. The Gauchos also outshined USC defensively when it came to blocking, leading with 14 blocks versus USC’s four. 
The Trojans will need to shake off this loss in their battle against the Tritons. UCSD, with an overall 8-9 record, was swept by UCSB at home last Friday, and the Tritons are coming off a home 0-3 loss against Ball State. San Diego is currently 0-2 in the Big West conference and, like USC, is looking to break a short-run losing streak and find a victory. 
“It’s gonna take time but consistently practicing with an aggressive mindset and making sure that everyone’s doing their job to know that we can build trust,” junior middle blocker Connor Inlow said,
The Men of Troy are currently averaging 12.5 kills per set with a .274 overall hitting percentage. They average 1.1 aces per set and only about 1.6 reception errors. They have proven to be solid on serve receive and on defense, with 8.3 digs per set. USC is usually a strong blocking team but is still working on its consistency to improve their defense. Wyett is leading the team by a significant margin in total number of kills this season. He also leads in total digs, with Grasso and junior outside hitter Ryan Moss following closely behind. Hall currently has the most assists, and Grasso touts the highest number of aces with 28. 
UCSD will rely on freshman outside hitter Wyatt Harrison on offense, along with senior opposite hitter Tanner Syftestad. The Tritons’ offense will be aided by senior setter Milosh Stojcic, who recorded 35 assists in his last match against Ball State. 
USC will continue to set to their powerhouse outside hitters, Grasso and Wyett. Lisha will set along with Hall, and junior libero Matt Douglas will need to take over defensively. They will also rely on Lewis and Inlow to put the ball away and set up strong blocks. 
“[We’ve been] learning from previous losses and continuing to grind,” Douglas said. “We just passed our mid season mark and injuries are piling up. Mentally, it’s been taxing, and we’re making a push right now for the end of the season and eventually playoffs.”

Julia Poe | Daily Trojan
Sunday night marked one of many times in which the world of sports spills over into pop culture, politics and art. Kobe Bryant took center stage at the 90th Annual Academy Awards, scooping up his first Oscar win for the animated short Dear Basketball.
As the king of Los Angeles basketball accepted an award in his home city, he was met with triumphant applause and a standing ovation. But the scene wasn’t as celebratory as it appeared. Instead, it was a testament to the work still left to do for the women’s empowerment movements that have been championed by Hollywood over the past year.
Time and time again, celebrity movements have proven their hypocrisy through a variety of actions that are all bark and no bite. The #MeToo movement has been powerful when it trickled down to the general masses of American society, and it certainly has unseated its fair share of Hollywood stars as well. Yet last night forced an uncomfortable question back into the faces of movie and sports fans alike — does #MeToo really mean anything in the grand scheme of things?
The scene last night was pretty bleak. Actors and actresses wore Time’s Up pins on their dresses and suits as a symbol of solidarity with the movement aimed at preventing and punishing sexual assault and abuse in Hollywood. Presenters and winners alike gave speeches about empowerment and protection, highlighted by Frances McDormand’s moving speech following her Best Actress in a Leading Role win. And then the Academy handed trophies to two men with pasts containing accusations of violence toward women.
It’s hypocritical at worst, inconsistent at best. The lack of spotlight on Bryant’s history has been concerning for years, with conversation resurfacing occasionally but always dissipating quickly in the shadow of his accomplishments. 
Bryant was charged with sexual assault in 2003, and only avoided a trial when his then-19-year-old accuser decided to drop criminal charges and not testify. She later pursued a civil suit, and they settled out of court. Part of the settlement required that he read a statement expressing that he understood now that the victim “feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”
This seems like a textbook example of situation in which the celebrities championing the #MeToo movement should openly and proudly denounce Bryant. The accusations against him are well-recorded and serious. In fact, they sound similar to the stories that have surfaced about Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein and many other Hollywood stars who were ousted over the past few months. 
It was a situation in which a man seemed to use his celebrity and clout to overpower and overwhelm a young, vulnerable woman. It was wrong, and Bryant deserved the same vitriol for that incident as any of the other men who felt the wrath of #MeToo this year.
I’ve seen a variety of arguments in the past day attempting to defend both Bryant and the Academy. One of the most popular is that Bryant only stood judgement from one allegation with no court decision to back it up, so he shouldn’t be punished for an alleged assault that might not have happened. I could buy into this, perhaps, if I hadn’t seen Kevin Spacey pulled out of House of Cards and the Oscar-nominated All The Money In The World over allegations before any legal steps were taken.
This has been one of my main issues with the #MeToo movement for some time now. The same people who loudly denounced the actions of Weinstein and others this year also stood and applauded for Woody Allen or Roman Polanski when they won awards in the past. And the same celebrities who made speeches and quips about women’s empowerment literally moments before showed no remorse in cheering on Bryant’s achievement.
This issue ultimately reflects a greater dilemma facing the sports world as a whole. We let violent college athletes keep their scholarships, then hand them Heismans and Player of the Year trophies. We suspend violent professional athletes for a week or two for beating their wives, then toss them back on the field when our teams need a win. Never mind the progress that’s being slowly made in other parts of our culture — when it comes to sports, time isn’t up for anyone at all.
As a fan, it’s hard to identify who to blame in this situation. Is it the institutions — the NFL, NCAA, MLB and NBA? Is it the coaches, or the players themselves? Or is it actually just us, the fans, the ones who turn on the TV and hand over the power to the players whom we love and admire and practically worship? 
I believe it’s a mix of everyone involved, a general attitude that has existed for decades, that manifests as complacent ignorance in order to maintain our love for game and sport as a whole. This ignorance has dulled the edges of every institution, coach, player and fan who refrains from speaking out or holding a violent man accountable out of fear of losing the glimmer of escapism that sports provide.
What is amazing is to see how this complacency spreads, even into communities who claim that the time for cover-ups and turning a blind eye is now long over. Hollywood has done its best to attempt to prove that its days of harboring violent men are long over (although Gary Oldman, who took home the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role despite his ex-wife’s claims that he choked and beat her in 2001, might have something to say about that). 
At the end of the day, the reaction to Bryant’s win illustrated just how far we have to go in matters of sexual assault and violence. How great of a giant are we willing to topple in order to prove that enough is enough? After all, Kobe Bryant is basketball in so many ways. The Oscars illustrated that although the media industry is beginning to take strides, that progress still isn’t strong enough to move an industry mountain like Bryant.
Sunday proved the same point once again — Hollywood might say that time is up, but it’s not up for everyone. And as long as we continue to protect and applaud men accused of violence, this violence will continue. It’s time for that to change.

Undergraduate tuition at USC will increase from $53,448 to $55,320 for the 2018-19 school year, University officials confirmed in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan. 
Tuition will increase by $1,872, or 3.5 percent. 
In 2017, the University increased tuition from $51,422 to $53,448, a 3.93 percent or $2,006 increase. 
This year’s tuition hike is the lowest increase since the 1969-70 school year,  according to a statement emailed from the University to the Daily Trojan. 
“USC’s financial aid pool continues to be the largest in the country, with annual percentage increases that are larger than tuition increases,” the University wrote. “With two-thirds of USC students receiving financial aid, this substantial pool of aid helps drive down the average net cost of attendance to $32,892.”
Provost Michael Quick said tuition costs go to providing students with valuable educations.
“Our students receive access to superior faculty, classes and programs, internships and career services, and they are more than ready to graduate to become the leaders in their chosen fields,” Quick said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
However, some student leaders want to see more transparency regarding how their money is spent.
“I think the common sentiment felt among students is that people aren’t happy because we don’t know where that money is being spent,” Undergraduate Student Government president-elect Debbie Lee said. 
Lee said that while it is unrealistic to get the University to freeze tuition costs, they are working to increase transparency by encouraging the University to publish a line-item budget of where tuition is distributed. 
“We want students to know that we are working with the administration for tuition transparency so they know where their money is going,” USG vice president-elect Blake Ackerman said. 
USC had the ninth most expensive tuition rate in the country for the 2017-18 school year according to the U.S. News and World Report, ranking among other universities and elite liberal arts colleges.

Oscar winner Frances McDormand finished her acceptance speech for Best Actress in a Leading Role at Sunday’s Academy Awards by saying, “I would like to leave you with two words: inclusion rider.” 
The phrase “inclusion rider” was coined by Stacy Smith, director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative for the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Smith created the term in 2014 after writing a guest column in The Hollywood Reporter about issues of inclusion in Hollywood. The term describes a demand actors and actresses can add to their contracts to ensure diversity among cast and crew.
In an interview broadcasted by Annenberg Monday on Facebook Live, Smith told Annenberg Dean Willow Bay that the term inclusion rider was a “step toward countering bias in the interviewing or casting process.”
In the interview, Smith said that when McDormand asked all the female nominees in the room to stand, she was surprised with the small number of women in the room. Inclusion rider is a term created years ago, which has experienced increased popularity  as a result of the Time’s Up movement, she said.
Smith has conducted years of research on various topics relating to representation in Hollywood, such as patterns of screen representation, behind-the-camera employment and barriers facing women and underrepresented minorities in the media. In her research, she offers the inclusion rider as a solution to counter inequality in Hollywood and the media.
A typical inclusion rider sets numerical goals for casting in entertainment to ensure the “world onscreen looks like the world in which we live,” Smith told The New York Times. 
“If 40 percent of the country is filled with individuals from underrepresented racial groups, 20 percent of the country is filled with individuals with disabilities, there is no reason why these individuals aren’t reflected in stories,” Smith told Bay in the interview.

These are only a few of the premises of short stories in Willful Creatures, a book written by Aimee Bender, an author and USC English professor.
Recently, one of the stories from Willful Creatures, titled “End of the Line,” inspired Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Jessica Sanders to create a narrative short film of the same name. The film premiered in January at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. Sanders and Bender’s paths crossed in 2005, when Bender published her third book, Willful Creatures. 
“[Aimee] was my best friend’s writing teacher at UCLA Extension,” Sanders said. “She always raved about Aimee, and so I started reading her work [and] became an immediate fan.” 
Upon reading “End of the Line” in Willful Creatures, Sanders was moved by the poignant story, setting in motion a project that would materialize 13 years later. 
“I read [End of the Line] and it just always stayed with me; Aimee’s writing is so visual and unusual and striking and specific,” Sanders said, “There’s a lot of deep themes, like power, and desire, and loneliness that [Bender] explores in a very short amount of time.”
Bender’s stories are simultaneously inventive and organic, since her surreal premises are deeply rooted in her own synthesis of larger emotional truths. “[Surrealism] is definitely my natural leaning as a person … it’s the kind of art I respond to more,” Bender said, “I like things that are a little skewed.”
Willful Creatures certainly exemplified her unusual style of writing, but Bender’s creative process is anything but willful. “I’ve tried outlining, I’ve tried knowing what the story was in advance, I’ve tried all of those things,” Bender said. “It always works best if I don’t know, and it always is most interesting to me if I don’t know and can let myself be surprised.”
For Bender, the premise of “End of the Line” took months to discern.“ [‘End of the Line’] was initially titled ‘A Series of Sadistic Episodes’ because I was just writing these little moments,” Bender said. “I found them really disturbing so I would write them, and leave them, and then leave them for a couple months, and then another day open the file and write a little more.”
Ultimately, Bender’s piece culminated into a work that explores power imbalances in a way that leaves much up to the reader’s personal interpretation. Bender noted how she has received readers’ feedback, who recognized that her story’s power struggle relates to the aspects of gender in society.
For Sanders, exploring these power disparities through her filmmaking was key. She adapted “End of the Line” into a script, and in 2016, with Bender’s permission, she pitched it to Refinery29 as a part of its Shatterbox Anthology series. The series was created by the company to support short films created by female filmmakers. 
“Hollywood is so unequal in its hiring practices, [and with] so few female directors getting hired, [Refinery29] was like, ‘We want to change that,’” Sanders said of the series’ purpose. “The theme of their campaign was power.” 
Refinery29 was supportive of Sanders’ project and the vision she hoped to bring to life on the screen. While Bender and Sanders kept in touch, Bender preferred to give Sanders space to cultivate her own creative vision. “I think part of being a fiction writer is you like to do the whole thing — I like to do the sentences, I like the rhythm, I like to create the scene,” Bender said. “But I’m not a filmmaker, so in that way it’s just complicated because obviously it’s [Sanders’] vision.”
Although Sanders’ work was based off of Bender’s literary imagination, her film is a different work of artistic interpretation. But Sanders’ film and Bender’s original story still share synchronous elements. To Bender’s surprise, while watching the trailer for Sanders’ short, she found elements of the surrealist world she pictured in her head when writing the story visualized on the screen. 
“It does look like the pet store I imagined,” Bender said, commenting on the opening setting of the film. “[I wondered,] how did that get translated so well?”
Sanders suggests the synchronicity in both their artworks is a result of similar life experiences, which shaped their perspectives. “Aimee’s a woman, I’m a woman,” Sanders said. “It’s a female lens on masculinity and power and the and abuse of power.”

Valeriy Cherepakhin, a graduate student majoring in chemistry, and Zhiyao Lu, a postdoctoral scholar, won the second annual USC Wrigley Sustainability Prize Monday for their company, Catapower. The company focuses on processes that upgrade types of plastic.

“We turned what is in the U.S., subsidized agricultural feedstock, into value-added renewable chemicals,” Lu said. “In this case, we made biodiesel because it is very beneficial to the environment.”
Cherepakhin and Lu were one of seven teams selected to give their final pitch at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center in front of a panel of judges, the culminating point in a process that spanned the past month. Students drafted business plans and honed their pitches, while assigned mentors helped them along the way to translate their ideas into action.
“They’ve shown us how to make a pitch, how to deliver a pitch, how to really show our science [in a way] that’s going to have a translational value, because we as scientists, we usually deal with equipment or labwear, we don’t deal with people that much,” Lu said.
The USC Wrigley Sustainability Prize was founded last year to inspire and support the development of entrepreneurial businesses focused on improving the environment.
Chase Puentes, Program Coordinator for the Wrigley Sustainability Prize, said the competition’s aim is to combine profitability with environmental care.
“Our biggest goal is to marry this idea of environmentalism and sustainability with business and entrepreneurship,” Puentes said. “We found that a lot of times there’s a gap there and many business-minded people are profit-driven and many environmental applicants or people who are trying to run with that theme are not so much business-trained or business-minded so we’re trying to put those two together and come up with some really cool profitable but also environmentally beneficial ideas in the end.”
Along with the $7,000 in prize money, Cherepakhin and Lu won the recognition that last year’s competitors used to secure hundreds of thousands of dollars in outside funding to implement their ideas.
Interphase Materials, the company that won last year’s competition, received $750,000 from the U.S. Department of Education to implement its nano-cooling technology to improve power plant efficiency. Interphase Materials recently signed a contract with the U.S. Navy as well.
Holly Tassi, who placed third in last year’s competition, used her winnings to conduct feasibility research in Ghana for her company Believe in Bambara. Her goal is to build the infrastructure necessary to support the cultivation of the Bambara nut, a highly nutritious and sustainable legume that could alleviate hunger and provide economic relief.
For Tassi, the Wrigley Sustainability Prize competition didn’t just help her refine her pitch, it inspired her and gave her the confidence to actually implement her idea.
“I think I took away more confidence in the business model and the business idea,” Tassi said. “I think that comes into play a lot from my mentor as well as, you know, receiving a prize is also helpful and a validation of itself. I do just feel a lot more confident in being able to communicate concisely what my business idea is.”
For the organizers, the continued success of their participants is encouraging for them to continue putting on the program.
“We launched the competition to support the institute’s goal to not only deepen understanding of our environment, but to develop practical solutions for preserving it,” Puentes said in a Dornsife news release. “So we’re incredibly proud and grateful to hear stories of success — less than a year later — from students in programs throughout the university.”
