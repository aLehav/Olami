About 40 union workers held up picket signs reading “Practice What You Preach” and “Equality! Justice!” as they marched outside  the future location of USC’s new Catholic Center Wednesday, at the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and University Avenue.

The protest, hosted by the Coalition for Jobsite Justice, was aimed at ensuring the Catholic Center is built with community members’ rights in mind. 
“We would like to see the Catholic Center pre-qualify contractors so that they offer fair wages, family protection, health insurance and employee benefits to their workers,” said Don Newton, a member of the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers Union.
According to Newton, construction was going well when it was in the hands of Matt Construction, which posted the mock-up plan of the site. The church switched contractors to Frazier Masonry, however, and the protestors believe the company is not offering employees the benefits they deserve.
“Frazier Masonry does not respect apprenticeship and only certain people benefit,” said Robbie Hunter, executive secretary of the Los Angeles and Orange Counties Building and Construction Trades Council. “There should be an obligation to respect the standards of working people in the area.”
Catholic Center officials were unavailable for comment at presstime. 
Hunter said the plan is to first ensure fair contractors are brought in so all workers have fair rights.
“Phase two is to hire local workers instead of hiring from different counties and states,” Hunter said.
Protestors hope local unions will help the employees.
“The people who are working here now are working without insurance,” said Rosalio Martinez, a protestor and member of a worker’s union. “I am here today hoping that people will listen because local unions can bring benefits to their employees and everyone should have the chance to work correctly.”
Richard Whitney, president, secretary and treasurer of the BAC Union disapproved.
Whitney said it is ironic the Catholic Church, which preaches that people should do good deeds, is allowing this injustice to occur in building their site.
“Pope John Paul II talked about man should have the right to fair pay, fair work and health care, but we do not see that happening here,” Whitney said.
Robert Collins, a field representative for the BAC Union, said given its location, USC is connected to the surrounding community and should help get the community to support the church.
“USC has been a union-friendly campus in the past,” Collins said. “We have contacted Father Seyer from the church here but we have not received a response yet.”  
Newton said they plan to coordinate with the university in upcoming weeks.
“We will work with USC to see that local workers are brought in and that they receive the correct benefits,” Newton said.
So if the jobs go to the higher paid union workers is that being fair to the guys who would do the same job for less?
All it would do is make the entire project more expensive.
Good piece!  I’m unsure whether USC is directly involved in negotiating the construction contracts for the new center, but it will be on USC-owned property and I’m sure USC has influence over this matter.  This is not really outside of USC’s attitudes towards unions, as the hospital workers and nurses and janitors unions are all now currently upset at USC’s treatment of them.
The Catholic Center operates independently from the university, no?  The article implies that USC has authority over the Catholic Center.
A completely BIASED article.
Only ONE-SIDED.
Is this simply free propaganda for the Union’s?
This is not journalism.
This is indoctrination, pure & simple.
You really think that we can’t see through this?
Pathetic.

Two men who authorities initially thought might have been responsible for a string of robberies near USC on Monday night are no longer considered suspects in the crime.
The Los Angeles Times published a story Wednesday morning reporting LAPD had arrested two men responsible for robbing three USC students Monday night, but USC’s Dept. of Public Safety said this is not true.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said he is unsure how that information was released.
“There is no indication that the suspects they have are the same ones,” Carlisle said. “It’s strange how stuff circulates.”
Carlisle said DPS hadn’t heard anything regarding the suspects in this case from the LAPD, and they are still seeking information.
“I’d love to get a phone call,” Carlisle said. “There is a big discrepancy because if they had our property, those would be our guys. That hasn’t happened. I wish it would, but so far, no.”
LAPD confirmed later Wednesday afternoon that the two men were not suspects in the USC crimes.
The three robberies occurred on the 1100 block of 29th Street, the 2700 block of Hoover Boulevard and the 2700 block of Ellendale Place.

Around 1 p.m. yesterday, about 50 students dressed in elaborate costumes congregated at Tommy Trojan, with hope of winning Coachella tickets.
A Facebook event had announced Program Board was giving away 10 Coachella tickets to those with the best costumes, either individuals or teams.
Punk’d · Davey Martinez, a junior majoring in music industry, dressed up to try to win tickets. The event was a prank created by Skull & Dagger, a semi-secret honors society. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan 
But when the judges announced the winners, all of them turned out to be members of Skull & Dagger, a semi-secret honor society that annually pranks the university.
As the crowd looked around, upset and confused because the costume winners were all dressed in black overcoats, a large banner with a skull came down from the roof of the Student Union building across from Tommy Trojan, revealing the prank.
“I’m just really sad. I spent $80 on my entire costume,” said Nick Davis, a junior majoring in narrative studies and Russian.
Davis was wearing a wedding dress and veil to the event to try and win Coachella tickets.
Danielle Espinoza, the incoming executive director of Program Board, said the majority of Program Board members were unaware the event was a deception.
“I would like the students to know that this prank is not a reflection of Program Board,” Espinoza said. “All but a few members were completely unaware that this event was not legitimately related to the organization.”
Last year, Skull & Dagger members created a two-part prank. The members handed out coupons for free food at The Lot, a temporary dining facility at USC, for a fictional “Student Appreciation Day.”
The prank was not well received by USC Hospitality, however, which said the prank negatively impacted service.
Last year’s Skull & Dagger members also placed a stack of microwaves in front of Tommy Trojan as a tribute to former USC President Steven B. Sample.
There were mixed reactions from students who attended the costume contest thinking they could win a free Coachella ticket.
“I am very, very upset. This is kind of messed up. I spent $40 I didn’t have to make this happen,” said Davey Martinez, a junior majoring in music industry who dressed up in a complex balloon costume that covered most of his body. “Coachella is a little too big to mess around with people.”
Others thought the prank was funny.
“It’s a good joke and everyone is taking it too seriously,” said Chantae Reden, a sophomore majoring in political science.
Eric Ronan, a senior majoring in public relations and a member of Skull & Dagger, was pleased with how the prank went.
“We won,” he said.
Alisia Thompson, a senior majoring in neuroscience and a member of Skull & Dagger, had one word for students:
“No-chella,” Thompson said.
Sorry, but anyone that spent money on costumes, over-confidently ASSUMING they would win, kinda deserves it if you ask me.
Even if it was a real contest, there was still a higher possibility of you losing than you winning.
I feel for them because of the embarrassment that probably caused. But other than that, oh well.
Counting your chickens before they hatched as grandma would say :) tough luck
Honestly, congratulations Skull & Dagger for being on a campus of THOUSANDS and managing to prank just 50 people who really wanted to go to Coachella but couldn’t afford the tickets. Real classy. Getting people to dress up in silly costumes on campus is funny, but taking advantage of people who are broke and desperate is just a dick move. Also, your costumes were stupid.
Props to the people who did come out and dress up, because there were some sick outfits for sure.
trolls be trollin’
Last years prank was irresponsible, this years was sadistic and childish. I would like to suggest a way to make it up to the people who were cheated. The people who designed this prank should be made to march around Tommy Trojan wearing Adult Diapers and sucking on pacifiers. While a kazoo band plays the old Romper Room Theme. All this as their clothes are sold at silent action to compensate the victims. We could all have a grand time cutting capers. I’m in for $20.
It’s not like anyone MADE people dress up in balloons and crazy costumes…
pranks are supposed to be amusing…. this was not.
This was hilarious. HAHAHA. Got ’em good.
In response to the USG member… Chris and Nehi and the whole USG organization has done a lot this year. All USG accomplished could not have been done without the relationships forged by Chris and Nehi with almost every administrator on campus. From an extra day off for Thanksgiving Break to the Greater LA excursion project, this has been a very effective administration. I talk to adminstrators all the time and they could not be more pleased with USG’s and Program Board’s results this year. 
Also, this was not related to USG or PB at all from my understanding…
funny prank. wayyy better than s&d’s prank last year. the only thing I didn’t care for was having Program Board’s name attached to it. s&d members that are also apart of USG and Program Board should’ve known better…”should’ve” being the operative word.
Wow – a phony contest – what creativity S&D!! You guys are like SOOOO funny. Did you guys all go back to your parents’ basement and hi five each other to an endless stream of “bros”.
The only problem I have with these “pranks” is the lack of humor and staleness each year brings. You guys are a whoppi cushion away from zero ideas. 
I hope no one has been doing anything to the food you guys have been eating this past week either – such as “releasing” certain fluids into it – for that would not be funny either.
I think USG are a bunhc of nerd bombs. The only thing more lame would be to create a secret soceity with a bunch of gdis
nerddsss
I agree with daddio his name is greg pearson.
Chris and Nehi are one big joke anyways, they have really taken USG to a new low during their time getting nothing done.
Having been in USG for a long time, it saddens me that this was allowed to happen. In general people haven’t had vast amounts of respect for us to begin with, now Chris and Nehi have managed to destroy what little respect we did have, that we have worked years to obtain.
Still, the guy that spent $40 he “didn’t have” has more serious problems he needs to figure out then in his life other than coping with the fact he won’t be going to coachella.
Both sides are full of stupid people, this was hilarious to read
1. People in the Skull and Daggers actually think people care about any pranks they have done
2. The losers who think people care about they crying over Coachella tickets. And the fact that they even care about Coachella to begin with.
This article made my day.
s&d = misuse of student programming fees…something must be addressed..good prank but they used ur money that u are payin for programming..
For the record, No funds were used by the university or any funding boards to make the prank happen. This was from out of the pockets of the S&D members
I say balloon boy should be the poster child for all future Coachella Festivals.
YES PLEASE!  If i had an extra ticket i would give it to him!
Thanks
These people should consider themselves lucky.  If they won, they would have had to go to Coachella, which means standing around for three days, listening to a bunch of has-been acts that our parents like (and a few mediocre ones from today), baking in the hot sun, paying $6 for water, surrounded by a bunch of people who are more self-important and self-satisfied than even the Skull & Dagger folks.  
Be glad you “lost,” guys.  Coachella isn’t what it was in ’99 & the couple directly following.  There are immeasurably better music festivals out there.
Ouch, lil’ mm.  You remember how much you liked Duran Duran lullabies until your junior year in high school and now you have the audacity to put down mommy’s favorite band?  Shame on you!
I thought the “mmartinez” comment was funny but I don’t quite get the follow-up.
Also, these people look more like they were trying to win tickets to Burning Man than Coachella.  Maybe the two should just merge since they’re equally lame and draw equally annoying crowds — albeit in different ways.
Totally disagree….
Arcade Fire, Kanye, Black Keys…
a dick move, but i don’t expect much from the group in general; from what i’ve heard from previous members, s&d doesn’t do much besides plan the yearly prank, making it a largely self-congratulatory secret society. but props to the dt for covering this from all sides.
In response to Heinrich, pranks are never nice and selfless. I thought this was a epic prank that will be remember in USC history. It capitalized on the hype surround Coachella and used that to pull of a legitimate prank at a grand level.
A grand level? They only pranked about 50 people on a huge campus…and most people who weren’t there didn’t even know about it until they heard from friends, etc because ppl were pissed about not getting tickets.
I’m all for a good prank, but this was just mean and self-satisfied. I’d never even heard of Skull and Dagger before, but I’ve lost any respect for them.
well, you weren’t gonna get a bid anyways

Junior college guard Greg Allen signed a national letter of intent to join the USC men’s basketball program next fall, USC coach Kevin O’Neill announced Wednesday.
Allen, a 6-foot-3 shooting guard for Navarro College (Corsicana, Texas), will be eligible to play when the Trojans begin the 2011-2012 season Nov. 11 against Cal State Northridge.
“We are excited to have Greg join our program,” O’Neill said in a statement. “He has the ability to shoot the ball and defend the opposition’s best player which will be important and allow him to make an immediate impact on our program. He’s a great kid with an amazing work ethic, and we are excited about him becoming a Trojan.”
This last season, Allen averaged 11 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game, while leading the Bulldogs to the quarterfinals of the Region 14 junior college tournament. Throughout the season, Allen made 63 three-pointers while shooting 40 percent from beyond the arc. Navarro College also advanced to the NJCAA Final Four in 2010.
As a senior at Eureka High School during the 2008-2009 season, he averaged 25.1 points per game, while shooting nearly 37 percent from 3-point range.
Allen, who has two years of eligibility remaining, initially committed to USC in late January, two days after USC freshman guard Bryce Jones announced he would leave the program.
With his signing, USC’s 2011 incoming recruiting class includes four prospects, 7-foot-1 center James Blasczyk (Bayton, Texas), 6-foot-2 guard Alexis Moore (Long Beach, Calif.), 6-foot-5 guard Bryron Wesley (Etiwanda, Calif.) and Allen.
Next fall, the Trojans will also gain the services of forwards Dewayne Dedmon and Aaron Fuller, who transferred to USC and practiced with the team last season.

By the time the 2009-10 season ended for the USC women’s basketball team, the coaching staff noticed a startling trend during its team’s home games.
“[The coaches] used to look in the stands and there were maybe 100 people there for games,” said team manager Saphia Raymond. “They didn’t like that.”
Fandom · The Galen Groupies are the women’s basketball  team’s fan base. The group hopes to inspire more attendance at the team’s games. - Courtesy of the Galen Groupies 
So they did something about it. In an age when every university and athletics office has a marketing department that takes care of promoting their teams, the coaches of USC’s women’s basketball team decided to take matters into their own hands.
“It started last year, when the new coaching staff came in,” Raymond said. “USC coach [Michael] Cooper, [assistant] coach [Kelley] Gibson, and [associate head] coach [Ervin] Monier … When they came in, they said they wanted to take USC basketball to where it had been in the past.”
And to do that, they figured they would have to build fan support for home games.
“[The coaches] thought ‘We want to do something new, we want to bring more students in [to games],’” Raymond said. “They wanted to be proactive with marketing.”
Soon enough, an idea was hatched to create a Facebook page for fans attending the women’s basketball games.
Similar to how Trojan Fever represents fans of the men’s basketball team, they wanted a group that would represent supporters of the women’s basketball team.
They planned a Facebook page to provide news about the Women of Troy, and women’s basketball in general, including behind-the-scenes interviews with players from the squad, clips from the team’s road trips and exclusive coverage of the team.
All the fan organization needed was a name.
“The coaches came up with it,” said Raymond, who acts as the webpage’s main administrator. “I left work and they were like ‘We need to come up with a name for the group.’ I came in the next day and they were like ‘Galen Groupies!’ and I was like ‘Okay! That works!’”
After the webpage was deemed appropriate — that it avoided any NCAA compliance issues — Raymond and the coaches created the Facebook page and made their first post in October — just in time for basketball season.
Thus, the Galen Groupies were born.
Word spread quickly about the new fan base for the team. Friend requests were sent out to hundreds of USC students. Currently, the page has more than 500 friends.
Unfortunately, even though the program has pushed for increased attendance, the Galen Center’s seats remain mostly empty during the Women of Troy’s games. A large portion of the students who come are other athletes there to support their peers.
“[The Facebook page] helps some with all of the updates,” said junior guard Ashley Corral. “But there’s a big difference between getting on the computer and reading about us, and actually showing up to games. I don’t know what it’s going to take, but getting more fans is definitely something I think we should focus on.”
Before advancing to this year’s WNIT championship, no USC player had experienced the intense atmosphere of postseason play.
“Playing in the WNIT and seeing how much support each one of those schools had at home was eye-opening,” Corral said. “Toledo had over 7,000 fans there [for the WNIT championship game]. Here at USC, you would think we’d have a lot of fans at every single game … [But] we only get a handful of students [at our games].”
The apathy for women’s basketball at USC was especially evident during a home game against UCLA on Feb. 6.
Hundreds of UCLA students followed their team into the Galen Center, forming their own make-shift student section. Throughout the game, the Bruin faithful cheered and chanted with no USC student section to counter their spirit.
USC ended up losing a close game, 74-67.
It might have been listed as a home game for the Women of Troy, but the atmosphere didn’t reflect that. The Associated Press noted that UCLA “enjoyed a clear advantage in fan support among the 2,812 in attendance.”
Such a strong pro-UCLA fanbase likely provided the Bruins with a decisive advantage.
“Having a big home crowd would help us a lot,” Corral said. “When we play at Galen, it’s almost like we’re not even playing at home. Because no matter who we’re playing, it seems like they have more fans.”
In both of the last two seasons, the Women of Troy finished with a 19-12 mark during the regular season, but were not invited to the NCAA tournament.
But in their WNIT run this March, the Women of Troy showed promise for next season, marching all the way to the championship game before falling to Toledo 76-68 in front of its home court.
With four starters and nine of its top-10 scorers returning next season, the team will have a chance to make another deep postseason run. Perhaps the only missing piece is a wealth of support from fans.
How embarrassing. I would try to get the student body and sororities involved by donating tickets for their fund-raisers and publicizing more around campus. Ultimately, the team will need to sell themselves and build their fan base, but this would provide a jump start.
You know… Those Galen Groupies in that photo are all actually the band. I remember there was absolutely no student fans there for that game.
i’m very disappointed no band was sent to the wnit championship game.  shame on athletics and the band!  fight on women of troy!
Start winning games, tell the coach to earn his pay…right now USC Women’s hoops is boring!!!
Wow. How insightful. Feel free to keep such scintillating commentary to yourself next time. 
I went to almost every home game when I was in school and had a lot of fun. They’re great athletes and deserve support. A good home crowd could mean the difference between a win and a loss in close games.

The USC men’s volleyball team, has a rich tradition of success, including four NCAA championships and 12 Final Four appearances.
Over the last couple years, USC coach Bill Ferguson has directed the USC men’s volleyball team back to the top of the collegiate volleyball hierarchy; his teams have been synonymous with the word “success.”
In just his first year coaching in 2007, Ferguson guided USC to its best season since 2001. Two years ago, he led the team to the NCAA championship game. And this year, the Trojans (19-2, 18-2) are off to their best start since 1994 and have already clinched the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title.
But as the team has grown increasingly dominant, student support has simultaneously been shrinking.
As good as the volleyball team has been, it’s unfortunate that not many students show their faces inside the Galen Center for home games.
There is definitely a ton of cardinal out there, but it’s not fans — it’s empty seats.
And you know it’s not good when you start getting emails from USC athletics advertising that the first 500 fans get something free just to come out to the match.
Yes, volleyball might not get the same national media attention as basketball or football, but I’d argue it’s just as exciting.
Who doesn’t want to see Murphy Troy six-pack an opposing player?
Even when the men’s basketball team was hit with sanctions a year ago and banned from playing in the postseason, students decked out in Trojan Fever shirts filled the entire student section as if they were playing for something. And no matter how bad this season’s losses to teams like Rider, Cal and Oregon were, the men’s basketball team still had support from the student body.
The USC men’s volleyball team is just as exciting and features one of the most dominant players in collegiate volleyball in senior opposite Murphy Troy.
Troy, a contender for National Player of the Year, has already etched his name into the USC record books, compiling 1,812 kills, 133 aces and 31 matches with 20-plus kills. All of these are USC scoring-rally era records.
Alongside Troy, the Trojans boast one of the more accomplished senior classes in USC volleyball history including, senior setter Riley McKibbin, senior outside hitter Tri Bourne and senior middle blocker Austin Zahn.
This year, USC is poised to make a deep run into the NCAA tournament and challenge for  the NCAA title.
And even though this core group will be leaving, next year holds even more promise for the Trojans.
Ferguson has managed to bring in a recruiting class featuring Micah Christenson, a 6-foot-5 setter from Hawaii, Cristian Rivera, a 6-foot-6 outside hitter from Puerto Rico, and Robert Feathers, a 6-foot-8 middle blocker from Loyola High in Los Angeles.
All three have distinguished resumés, and along with these three newcomers, USC will also bring back junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick.
Nobody has a problem supporting the men’s basketball team, even when times are tough, so all I ask is that you take a trip down to the Galen Center when the USC men’s volleyball team is playing.
In an all-important matchup against crosstown rival UCLA tonight, you can give the Trojans that homecourt advantage.
You’ll be watching a group of men just as talented — and arguably more exciting to watch — and you won’t regret it.

Saw the Trojans decimate the Bruins in three straight on Thursday.  Brought a fellow alum and his wife to their first game ever at Galen but were thoroughly disappointed with the lack of student support.  C’mon.  I know it was Thursday night but we’re talking about the NUMBER ONE team in the country with a great chance to beat on their cross-town rivals.
You forgot to mention Henry Cassidy, the starting libero who is only a freshman will be back next year. Add Tanner Jantzen a redshirt freshman who subbed for Murphy Troy one game when he had the flu, and played real well. Also, Madison McKibbin a soph who is the younger brother of Riley, and left handed will make a strong bid for a starting spot on the outside.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball is preparing to play the last two matches of its regular season this week, the first against No. 8 UCLA at the Galen Center.
The Trojans (19-2, 18-2) split a two-match series against Hawai’i over the weekend, dropping the first match in five sets and winning the second in a sweep.
Crosstown rivals · The last time UCLA and USC faced off this season, senior opposite Murphy Troy finished the game with 26 kills at a rate of .512. The top-ranked Trojans will now look to defeat the rival No. 8 Bruins at home this week. - Carlos Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“That was a wake-up call for us,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We were reminded that we can’t win just by showing up.”
This week, the Trojans will take on a Bruin team that has been one of men’s volleyball’s traditional powerhouses throughout coach Al Scates’ 49-year tenure.
Recent success, however, suggests a power shift in the entire sport. When presented with the idea though, Ferguson brushed that idea off.
“Whatever happened before Thursday night doesn’t matter,” he said with a laugh.
When the Trojans and Bruins last played at the end of January, senior opposite Murphy Troy finished with 26 kills earned at an exceptional .512 rate.
“I think we just ended up with some favorable matchups,” Troy said. “Our offense has evened out more, so I don’t expect to have that kind of stat line after this match.”
UCLA features a strong pair of middle blockers, junior Weston Dunlap and junior Thomas Amberg. Dunlap is second in the conference in attacking efficiency. Freshman outside hitter Gonzalo Quiroga has also emerged as a stabilizing force for the Bruins.
“If Quiroga can stabilize their passing, we can have some trouble with their quick attack,” Ferguson said.
But the top-ranked Trojans are not letting today’s rivalry matchup distract them from the task at hand,
“It’s more about finishing the season off strong than anything else,” said senior outside hitter Tri Bourne. “We just need to take care of it.”
This will not be the last time USC and UCLA face off.
Although it is the last time they will see each other in the regular season, the two are currently set to meet again in one week in the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
The tournament is scheduled to begin April 23 at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.
“This is just the 21st match of the season to us,” Ferguson said. “We’ll temper the emotional stuff. That will hopefully come at the end of May.”

News of the Week:
Britney Spears did it again 
It doesn’t seem to matter what crazy things American sweetheart Britney Spear does in her personal life. She’s as popular as ever. Her newest album, Femme Fatale, landed her the No. 1 spot on the Billboard chart, which gives her the title of first female to boast six No. 1 album debuts. Apparently, once you find a secure place in pop music listeners’ hearts, it’s hard to lose everlasting fame.

Event of the Week:
Art in the Streets, The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA
The self-proclaimed “first major U.S. museum exhibition of the history of graffiti and street art,” this exhibition highlights the growing popularity of street art. Artists include Shepard Fairey, Swoon, Mister Cartoon and, rumor has it, Banksy. Whether or not you believe graffiti is true art and should be displayed in the museum, this is your chance to be a part of a historic event in the art world and to see what street art is all about. This Saturday, the museum will have a swank opening party that is $25 for non-members. Otherwise, you can visit the museum at the low student cost of $5 — just remember to bring your ID.

Movie of the Week:
Scream 4
The newest installation to Wes Craven’s Scream chronology, which started back in 1996, tries to braid the older generation with the younger with appearances by starlets Hayden Panattiere and Anna Paquin, as well as more seasoned stars like Courteney Cox, Selma Blair and even comedian Anthony Anderson.
With some blatantly awkward and funny scenes mixed with the cheap thrills of the ridiculous and familiar mask that likes to jump out of random corners, Scream 4 seems willing to admit the story cannot be horror anymore. If anything, go see it more for the sheer comedy of the cheesy lines and the possibility of jumping out of your seat once or twice.

 Song of the Week:
“I Wrote the Book” — Beth Ditto
Beth Ditto, known for being the frontwoman for band Gossip, is not afraid to show off her strong vocals. Though “I Wrote the Book” is a little tamer than her Gossip tracks, her vocal chops are still obvious and are blended in a very ’80s, Madonna-esque sound. A club-friendly song that will likely see many remixes, the song is a good sign of the strength of Ditto’s solo work. The track is available for free on iTunes this week.

Although the band dropped off the face of the music world for a while, the Queens of the Stone Age’s characteristic personality and sound is coming back with a bang.
Reigning men · Tuesday’s Queens of the Stone Age show at The Wiltern brought an intense energy that made the audience form mosh pits. - Photo courtesy of Paul R. Giunta 
The band is on its first U.S. tour in three years in support of the reissue of its first, self-titled album, and played two sold out shows at The Wiltern on April 12 and 13.
The historic art-deco theater felt transformed into a raucous, hard rock dive bar, befitting of the Queens of the Stone Age’s live show. The venue was filled with fans who could not suppress their excitement; hundreds of people were screaming and there were signs of the horn waving in the air.
The opening act, The Dough Rollers, who signed on to perform through the whole tour wore suits with hair slicked back like Elvis. The music in turn echoed Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran with its country honky-tonk, blues and old school rock-and-roll styles.
The crowd, though mostly there to see the metal-influenced Queens of the Stone Age, seemed to enjoy the fun music that harkened back to an era gone by.
During the break, fog emanated from the stage, filling the entire theater with haze. In the background of the dark stage were several giant arches covered with giant fabric blueprints. When the Queens of the Stone Age took the stage, it was backlit by dozens of bright white lights that filled the back of the stage, illuminating the fog and creating silhouettes of the band members.
The band played the entirety of its debut album from 1998. The only time Queens of the Stone Age played songs from its more recent albums was during the two encores. Some of those songs included “Tangled Up in Plaid” from the band’s 2005 album Lullabies to Paralyze and “Go With the Flow” from the nearly universally acclaimed 2002’s Songs for the Deaf.
Frontman Josh Homme commented that playing the band’s first album brought out only it’s most awesome and diehard fans, at one point calling out the audience “so Los Angeles. Don’t try to be coy about it,” which he seemed to mean as a compliment.
Most of the night was filled with continual, intense rocking music, with only a few speaking breaks when Homme would banter about not wanting to be controlled or control the audience saying, “If you want to sing along, you can, but only if you want to.”
The band was a bit nervous and tight, but that didn’t stop it from performing with energy. The band members even danced to their own music. Bassist Michael Shuman headbanged and jumped around, and Homme often shook his hips.
The main theme of the night was intensity. Even when guitarist, keyboardist and percussionist Dean Fertita played some sort of maraca variation, he did it intensely and purposefully.
Even though The Wiltern has a sign saying “NO MOSHING. NO CROWD SURFING,” there was no way that Queens of the Stone Age’s rabid fans could not headbang, dance and mosh to the bass- and drum-heavy music.
By the first encore, multiple fans were crowd-surfing in the pit, adding even more life to the spirited audience.
During the multiple encores and at the end of the show, Homme, looking almost like a mix between James Murphy, Win Butler and Mr. Incredible, would grab the hand of a fellow band member, cutely walking hand in hand as only good friends do.
And the show proved the band members are still good friends, still making good music and will probably continue turning music venues around the world into places of complete madness.

Like it or not, food dyes are everywhere.
All you need to do is take whatever package of tasty snack food is in your hand, flip to the ingredients list and voilá, there they are: Food Drug & Cosmetics Blue No. 1, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and others, forming a veritable rainbow of edible, artificial colors.
These food colorings appear in the obvious places (Froot Loops, those ridiculously addictive sour gummy worms) and the less obvious places, like salmon and oranges.
Lately, there have been an increasing number of claims that these artificial food dyes are linked to cancer and can have negative health effects, particularly on younger kids. Some reports caution the dyes might cause hyperactivity, restlessness, and aggravate the symptoms of kids who have already been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD.
Maybe food dyes are to blame for my unwillingness to sit still and write papers Friday nights.
Jokes aside, the discourse about the future of food dyes is becoming increasingly contentious.
As expected, one of the organizations leading the charge and trying to look out for eaters everywhere is the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
Along with other food activists, the CSPI claims there is enough hard evidence to justify the banning of artificial dyes altogether.
To complicate the matter, most news coverage has made it hard to know what’s true and what’s simple, if potentially legitimate, speculation.
A quick Google search of the phrase “food dyes” brings up an interesting assortment of links, dotted with headlines like “Food Dyes: A Rainbow of Risks” and “Food Dyes Linked to Allergies, ADHD and Cancer.”
As we’ve all learned by now, it hardly matters if the article hidden behind the link discusses both sides of the argument. What catches people’s attentions is the headline.
And so it comes as no surprise that parents and consumers everywhere are, well, freaking out.
But for all it’s worth, the panic might be for naught.
“We have here the case of bad science, or good science being misrepresented, combining with a popular press incapable of assessing scientific claims, to create misleading or false conclusions,” Jeff Schweitzer, a scientist and former White House policy analyst, wrote in an article in the Huffington Post.
He continues, stating “as with many issues impacting society the valid concerns of parents have accelerated past the science.
There is no unequivocal, or even terribly convincing, evidence that dyes cause the alleged harm.” Although there are studies stating dyes do have an impact on health, others aren’t conclusive at all.
And although the Food and Drug Administration found some links between artificial food colorings and increased symptoms in certain children diagnosed with hyperactivity, a panel of experts also recently voted against mandatory warnings on packages, stating that for the vast majority of people, food colorings are not a problem.
They might, in fact, be essential.
That’s because the color of a food plays an important role in how we perceive that food’s taste.
A survey done by Columbia University’s Food and Brand Lab showed people found un-colored Cheetos snacks to be “bland” and not as “much fun to eat.”
And an article in The New York Times considered life without food colorings.
Beige Jell-O? Gummy bears the color of muddy water?
Yet a major problem with food dyes is the ethical issue of making not-so-vibrant foods “fresher” looking.
Examples include coloring oranges or adding color to a piece of raw tuna that would normally grey from travel and air exposure are questionable actions.
But even this is unavoidable when it comes to selling products, and it is ultimately beneficial.
Though color added to fish might seem stupid in, say, Hawaii, it’s probably necessary for fish going to Idaho.
Considering natural colorings derived from plants, herbs and the like aren’t as stable or long-lasting as artificial food colorings, it seems that for now, life will continue with an artificial hue.

“Paper or plastic?”
The question seems so mundane, and yet, the answer is not as clear as it might seem.
Bag It
For many, the response has become as automatic as the question is inevitable: “Plastic is fine.”
But have you ever stopped to think about what exactly happens with these plastic bags after they are thrown away? Where exactly is ‘away?’
Susan Beraza’s documentary, Bag It, holds a microscope over a part of American society that, like a bag in the wind, is often ignored.
The comical documentary, which aired last Sunday on PBS, follows Jeb Berrier, a self-proclaimed average man who would hardly consider himself a tree hugger. Yet, as a curious American, he sets out to discover the truth behind our plastic-dependent society.
His journey begins with a  simple plastic bag. Berrier purchased a single yogurt contain which was then placed inside a large plastic bag upon checkout.
This small occurrence leads him to muse about the presence of plastic bags in his quiet Colorado town, which is competing with another town to see which can reduce plastic bag use the most.
By showing shots of the simple town Berrier lives in and the familiar grocery stores he shops in, Bag It’s story is relatable for the average viewer.
His journey unfolds throughout the documentary, and what he eventually finds is the use of plastic, and not just plastic bags, is seemingly inescapable and far more prevalent in society than most imagine.
Today, more than 1 million plastic bags are used every minute and 100 billion are consumed each year in the United States alone.
Though Beraza’s cinematography is not incredible, this works with the style of the documentary.

Students who attended the TEDxUSC conference in Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday learned about the power of new technologies and the power of innovation.
Technology influences every aspect of our society — especially the way we conduct war. But we need to keep careful watch over that technology to make sure it doesn’t become dangerous and detrimental.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
As our weapons become more advanced, technology is progressively replacing humans on the battlefield, in the sky and in the ocean.
Progress in war technology is neither inherently good nor inherently bad.
The potential for growth is tremendous and exciting, but, as the nature of conflict changes, many challenges await.
One challenge will be addressing concerns about safety.
Last Friday, the Navy released a video of its Maritime Laser Demonstrator firing a laser beam at a motorboat a mile away.
The beam hit the motorboat and set it on fire, disabling it completely.
The Navy has been working on lasers for some time now, but Friday was the Navy’s first successful test of a laser on the water.
The Navy hopes to install lasers like the Demonstrator aboard its ships, with the aim of giving its vessels the capability to destroy enemy ships and even burn incoming missiles out of the sky.
With this ability, the United States would have a significant advantage over other nations in regard to nuclear weapons, as the United States would hypothetically gain the power to incapacitate nuclear-armed missiles midflight.
Still, most technology is far from perfect, and when technology fails on the battlefield, people die.
Earlier this week, an American Predator drone accidently killed two American soldiers in Afghanistan, the first instance of friendly fire from an unmanned aircraft.
Unmanned aircrafts have already changed the way wars are fought from the sky.
Drones have increased attacks on the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, while pilots controlled them from hundreds of miles away.
In this case, the person operating the unmanned aircraft might have confused the American soldiers for Taliban. If that was the case, that person would be the one to blame.
But who bears the responsibility when an unmanned machine malfunctions in a foreign country and kills innocent people?
As robots are becoming more autonomous with advancements in artificial intelligence (Northrup Grumman, one of the leading American defense contractors, has already developed an unmanned, autonomous helicopter that conducts surveillance, designates targets and assesses battlefield damage all on its own) policymakers need to have a long discussion about who bears the responsibility for robots at war.
Policymakers and military strategists also need to address the lack of vision for these new and powerful machines.
The United States must develop a central idea that can guide how American unmanned weapons are used moving forward.
The United States also needs to reform the rules of warfare to, for example, clearly define what constitutes unmanned action abroad.
The United States is attacking Taliban strongholds in Pakistan with drones, but President Barack Obama will never utter the words ‘the War in Pakistan.’
In his book Wired for War, P.W. Singer talks about the point of singularity — the state in which things become so radically different the old rules break down and we know virtually nothing.
To avoid complete confusion, policy makers need to face the challenges technological innovation has created if this paradigm shift is actually coming.

I am by no means a defender of fraternities. I am not a member of a fraternity. In fact, I hardly ever find myself on The Row.
With that said, however, the anger and insults directed at the entire fraternity system is overwhelmingly frustrating.
More than 35,000 students attend USC.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The campus attracts more international students than any other American institution for higher education.
And the university continues to climb in national rankings.
Clearly, we have a lot going for us, and our progress seems to be continuing.
But does that mean we are completely immune to incidents that might attract bad press?
Not at all.
Admittedly, most of the media coverage of USC in recent weeks has been negative.
Still, incidents involving a few students are not, and never will be, a reflection of the university as a whole.
By no means do I condone the content of the viral email linked to a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.
I also do not think it is right for another member of the same fraternity associated with the email to climb to the top of Waite Phillips Hall for his sexual exploits.
Still, our own student population has blown these two occurrences out of proportion.
The best, and only, way to get past these issues is to deal with the individuals involved — not condemn the entire student body.
The Interfraternity Council took the correct actions by punishing involved students, but the larger USC student body and the media have chosen to make sweeping generalizations about the Greek community as a whole.
That most of the student body feels a sense of embarrassment at our school and its administration is a cringeworthy thought.
I am most definitely not embarrassed to be connected to the USC student population.
I am a proud member of the Trojan Family, and I think it is about time we all stop bad-mouthing ourselves and once again operate as a single, symbiotic entity.
When USC alum O.J. Simpson murdered his wife and got away with it, did the Trojan population suddenly lose faith in the school?
Did students go around saying, “I told my friends I went to USC and they asked me, ‘Isn’t that the school where people learn how to get away with murder?’” No.
When Reggie Bush had his Heisman Trophy revoked, did we all suddenly lose faith in our university? No.
Most likely, life at USC went on as usual.
Yet here we are, squabbling about the awful and indecent nature of our Greek system, as well as our entire student community.
Why is it these immensely more public issues failed to create such a stir within the USC community?
Do sports not carry as much weight as Greek social life?
In the same way, does violence not matter as much as sex?
I would like to ask the members of the recent protests regarding these incidents a question: Why do you insist on holding the masses responsible, when individuals are creating the problem in the first place?
Frankly, it’s a waste of time to wallow in self-pity for three weeks, angrily discussing just how awful and scandalous all USC students are, when the individuals responsible were already punished for their actions.
Choosing to label every Greek student as a misogynist is just another example of convenient stereotyping to send a message.
 
David Morris is a sophomore majoring in English (creative writing).
To be honest, the protests make me wonder: Was there so much protesting because of the nature of the incidents or because they involved the Greek community?
From the day I came to USC, I have seen the greek/non greek division.  When something happens at SC, it seems that the incident is always worse when Greeks are involved.  I wonder if all of these protests would have happened if it was a non greek member.
I understand the desire to protest and show your support against the misogyny and sexism because I feel the same way in some aspect but placing blame on a segment of the population at USC because you finally have to chance to “stick it to the greeks” is childish and goes against the Trojan Spirit.  What should have happening is that those who felt a need to petition and protest should have collaborated with the greek community to make a difference instead of making all greeks look like the enemy.  There should have been no right or wrong side and there should have been no finger pointing (direct or indirect) What there should have been was unity.
I support the reasons why students stood up for their beliefs but I don’t support the message it sent and that it placed fault on fellow Trojans who have done nothing wrong.
I love my school and my Trojan brethren, I’m just saddened by the fact that many did not think to love their fellow greek system Trojans enough to give them a voice and be a family instead of taking their family status away.
While I can’t speak for the intentions of all the individuals involved, I attended the protest at Tommy Trojan and in no way did it single out greeks, nor were greeks excluded from participating. In fact, members of the greek community were in attendance and took advantage of the open mic to share their feelings on the recent scandals. Furthermore, the petition singled out the perpetrators of the e-mail for punishment and called for collaboration with IFC in encouraging general measures for a safer campus. I am at loss to understand where anyone’s basis for claiming a specifically “anti-greek” reaction is coming from.
I think what really makes people so upset is the lack of transparency in the disciplinary action. Just an investigation by the national fraternity? Seems like a huge conflict of interest to me. The truth is that this type of behavior could have occurred within any other university-affiliated group – an athletic team, an academic club, the radio station, whatever – and the administration hammer would come down. If anyone is angry at greeks it is not because they are greeks – it is because, apparently, they are treated differently than the rest of the student body.
Dear Daily Trojan,
I truly appreciate and admire your bold initiative in comparing recent Kappa Sigma events to other notable tragedies in USC history. However, I feel you did not press the issue enough. As we all know, OJ Simpson very likely got away with double-homicide after brutally murdering his wife and a male acquaintance of hers. While this event might seem horrific and inexcusable on the surface, it is nothing in comparison to the viral email forwarded to Kappa Sigma and the consensual public sex incident. Kappa Stigma (as they shall forever now be proclaimed) has truly left a unyielding stain on our great university that may never be removed. Some may argue that Kappa Stigma has received an undeserved amount of tabloid-centered publicity surrounding these two incidents but I rebuke these unwarranted claims. It is important for these fringe naysayers to understand how new media and new journalism works. Getting your information from Facebook, twitter, and anonymous blogs is universally accepted as credible now; in fact, we must all realize that producing other primary sources to back up your claims are passé in new journalism and show signs of weakness in the journalist, who shouldn’t need to refer to anyone else in clarification of the issue. No, new journalism is welcomed as a valid medium, and I stand tall in defense of DT and any other amateur “journalism” sites striving to publish what they are sure the readers want to read.
The thing is? People are ALWAYS going to hate on USC. We don’t need to hate on ourselves. Keep that Trojan Pride alive!!
FIGHT ON!
Jules
The pride you have for the university makes you the perfect person to help make it a better place! Who else but a proud trojan could be totally committed to making sure misogyny doesn’t perpetuate here? It takes school pride to give up all that time and effort to educate oneself and investigate whether or not there are systematic problems that enable individuals to behave as they do. Only someone who is totally invested in protecting their school’s reputation would make sure the university’s policies and actions are consistent with trojan values, like the equal value of all genders, races, classes, sexualities, etc. Anything we proud trojans can do to make the university a safer place, the more people we’ll have to share our pride! 
Gee, maybe you and the protesters have more in common than you thought…
When there is behavior as inappropriate and disgusting as the two Kappa Sig incidents that took place at USC, would you rather your fellow Trojans stand up quickly and denounce it, or ignore it and justify their position with unearned, self-satisfying comments about their inherent superiority? I am proud of the students and faculty who have participated in all the debates and demonstrations in the past month. Quite frankly, I would be ashamed if there WASN’T a response from the campus community, if we were all content to let this blow over when it’s a perfect time to examine some deep-seated cultural issues at USC. Isn’t that what education is all about?
God forbid we should keep attempting to improve our university and demand that all Trojans treat each other with dignity and respect. As an alum and an employee, this op-ed makes me feel embarrassed – it’s the equivalent of a bored cop saying “Move along, nothing to see here” as you walk by a flaming six-car pileup.
Well said. It’s about time people actually give a damn about anything around here instead of just looking beyond it.
Come on, David, do some critical thinking. Yes, these are isolated instances, but it verifies what people have seen before. If you think these can’t possibly represent any sort of sentiments in the system, your thinking is well on its way to superficial at best.
Seems there is a group of people who want everyone to be ashamed all the time. This group of people are not happy unless they are complaining, crying, whining, or in a state of “offended”. Thye need to toughen up, stop with the “victum” menatlity, and mind their own faults.
Thank you David for being the first member of the Daily Trojan to actually speak some truth about this issue. Yes, the email was disgusting, and yes, the couple having sex in public view on top of WPH was wildly inappropriate. There are so many great things going on at this school with a student body composed of great, interesting people making positive contributions to the university and the community. Choosing to focus on the negative, as has been going on in past weeks, only brings our school down. SO GET OVER THE EMAIL PEOPLE. Like really, it’s time to let it go protesters.
The email indicated a much larger issue as it was widely disseminated with the subject line “funny kappa sig” email. If anything, the email just provided a catalyst for illuminating bigger problems on campus and people simply want the university to use this as an opportunity for a larger discussion. I don’t understand why anyone would be against people who want to spark an open dialogue about universal issues…

Secret honor society Skull and Dagger pulled yet another prank on USC students. At around 1 p.m., students congregated around Tommy Trojan in the hopes of winning Coachella tickets. A Facebook event announced that Program Board was giving away 10 Coachella tickets to the people with the best costumes, either individuals or teams.
After some waiting, the contestants looked up to the roof of Student Union across from Tommy Trojan to see a banner with a large skull being unfurled, revealing this was a prank by none other than Skull and Dagger.
About 50 people were dressed in elaborate costumes. There were mixed reactions from students who dressed up to win the fake Coachella tickets.
Davey Martinez, a junior majoring in music industry, dressed up in a complex balloon costume that covered practically his entire body, was not very happy with the prank.
“I am very, very upset. This is kind of messed up. I spent $40 I didn’t have to make this happen,” Martinez said. “Coachella is a little too big to mess around with people.”
Nick Davis, a junior majoring in narrative studies, was equally upset after he wore a wedding dress and veil to the event to try and win Coachella tickets. He thought he had a good chance of winning one of the tickets.
“I’m just really sad. I spent a lot of money. I spent $80 on my entire costume.”
Though some students were upset, others did think it was a funny prank.
“I think it’s a good joke and everyone is taking it too seriously,” said Chantae Reden, a sophomore majoring in political science.
…someone had to get all those hipster kids to make fools of themselves.
Also, I’m totally with No-chella: what if you’d spent $40 on your costume and lost anyway? Would you still be mad? Look on the bright side: depending on your costume, you might end up with something to wear on Halloween.
I thought it was funny. I was out there looking ridiculous, but hey they got me. Bravo skull and dagger!
I am just going to explain this a little. To my knowledge Skull and Daggers tries to pull of a prank every year. Many fail and few succeed. This has been one of the better ones because no one was hurt, and it attracted a pretty funny looking crowd. They were clever in their approach to gather approx 100 participants. As a bystander I thought it was funny and epic, and many of my friends agreed. Some of the participants even applauded after they realized they had been pranked. I really do not see why people are agree. There was nothing wrong with this prank. Yes, they wasted 30 mins and $40 of a few students life’s, but in the grand scheme it was a great idea.  As a sophomore, I hope that I can someday be inducted in the the prestigious society
What this boils down to is just another group like DKA, people with delusions of grandeur that in truth is just a bunch of assholes.
Let’s not get DKA involved with this. We’re no Elphaba.
Skull and Daggers are a bunch of nerds.
A “secret society?” Really? Nothing screams douchebags more than a “secret society.”
“I’m so cool. I’m in a secret group no one else can know about.”
Hey, grow the f*** up.
(>*_*)>
Both Christopher Cheng  and Nehi Ogbeoven former President and Vice president of USG were involved in this tasteless prank. One would expect a lot more from two important members of the Trojan Family. Skull and Dagger at USC is not a “Secret Society” is an Honor society. USG and Program Board have lost a lot of credibility with this affair and this is sad because it overshadows all the hard work by these two organizations.
Best prank ever! Sure it would suck to have wasted some effort and money, but those people surely had fun making the costumes and thining about how awesome it would be to win. That’s why people buy lottery ticketes. Nice job to the organizers!
Completely tasteless and crude. Besides the costs spent, time was also wasted. Personally, I am not interested in going to Coachella, but for many people, it is something that they would love to experience. There is a much greater chance of winning these tickets than winning the lottery. Plus, if you win the lottery, you actually win something, so it is worth spending the money. No one even had a chance to win the tickets, because there weren’t even tickets at all.
Hey Jim, why don’t you try looking outside of your realm of spoiled USC brats and consider that some of us are not able to afford $300 tickets?
This is hilarious! Well done, pranksters
If you are so bummed that you spent money and lost it, why don’t you be less cheap next time and buy a Coachella ticket? Even if they are sold out, I got one on stubhub no problem. Whiners.
maybe because people can’t afford it, hense they’re going out for free tickets. and they’re even more expensive on stubhub.
Also, I’m curious if this “Chantae”  was a participant who put in the effort to make a costume. ‘I would think that this is “funny” if you didn’t waste time and money that you don’t have…
I’m so disappointed in USC. My friend and I spent over $40 to create our costumes, and we are aware that many people spent even more money. We would like to see involved members of the program board and the administrators involved punished for this hoax.
Regardless of how much money an individual spent making their costume…at the end of the day there was ALWAYS a probability that you would walk away empty handed. I’m sure there were individuals who had costumes that were better than yours. Now would you have been as mad had the competition been real and you STILL lost? Or are you just mad because it was a prank?

In the last four years, Denisha Brekke, a senior majoring in business administration, has visited four continents and six different countries, all through programs run by the Marshall School of Business.
All of the trips — ranging from Santiago, Chile her freshman year to Stockholm, Sweden just a month ago — have been unique and eye-opening experiences for Brekke, but there is one thing that set some of the trips apart: being shown around by a local host.
These hosts are known as Triptrotters, students from universities abroad who are interested in showing their cities to visiting travelers.
“What happens on these trips, especially in big groups of people, is you get there and for going out [at night] you’re on your own and a lot of people are clueless,” Brekke said. “And if you have a host, they can advise you and tell you about the best places to go.”
In addition to being in the know about good clubs and restaurants, cafes and hangout spots, being paired up with a local Triptrotter adds a new dimension to global networking and helps to build cultural understanding, according to Brekke.
Jamie Kwak, a 2010 graduate who majored in accounting and travelled to Budapest, Hungary through the Experiential Corporate Environment Learning Program run by Marshall, echoed Brekke’s sentiment that finding a local guide, as opposed to going on a formal tour, is invaluable.
“One place we went [in Budapest] there were a bunch of local students sitting around the fire drinking tea and eating these weird fish cracker things,” Kwak said. “And you just don’t see that when you go on tours with the big companies.”
There are efforts within the university to help facilitate these individual connections that can add depth to a study abroad experience.
This type of exchange and the expansion of the Trojan family is one of Marshall’s main goals in planning their international programs, according to Sean O’Connell, the director of International Programs at Marshall.
“Almost all of the visits and internship placements are made either with companies in which Trojans are employed, or Trojans own or connections through Trojans abroad,” O’Connell said. “In these programs the true vastness of the Trojan network really becomes something tangible for students and faculty.”
O’Connell said Marshall’s study abroad office believes it is important to support students while they’re abroad, but sometimes the best form of support is letting them experience the culture.
“At Marshall we recognize that with study abroad, quite a bit of the learning takes place outside of the classroom, and so we want the students to have access to these individuals, and the lessons they can teach, while they are away from campus,” O’Connell said. “It’s also great to see a friendly face when you are halfway around the world.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that “Students say local guides improve abroad experience.” They are known as Local Triptrotters, not local guides.

Three USC students were robbed in separate incidents Monday night. Officials suspect the same people are behind each crime.
The first robbery occurred at 9:15 p.m. on the 1100 block of 29th Street. The victim was on his cell phone when he was approached by four suspects who demanded his phone. When the victim refused, a suspect displayed a handgun, and the victim surrendered his cellphone. The suspects left promptly after.
The second robbery occurred five minutes later on the 2700 block of Hoover Boulevard. This time, two suspects approached the victim and demanded his property. The victim refused, but a suspect displayed a weapon, grabbed the victim’s property and fled.
The third robbery occurred at 9:35 p.m. near the 2700 block of Ellendale Place. The suspect held his weapon out and demanded the victim’s property. The victim quickly complied and the suspects fled.
“All three of the victims were USC students and the robberies occurred pretty quickly,” said Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle. “We think this is the same group passing through the neighborhood and taking advantage of the people they encounter.”
DPS is currently working with the LAPD Southwest division to find the suspects.
Carlisle encourages students to take reasonable precautions to prevent more incidents from occurring.
“Go in a group if you’re going to be off campus after dark,” Carlisle said. “Don’t go out alone because you’re more vulnerable that way. Better yet, take Campus Cruiser or other university transportation.”
Carlisle said he does not suspect the incidents to be gang-related and encourages any students who saw the robberies to contact DPS or LAPD.
A whole gang was in the restroom ? Did you call DPS or just go to class?
Seriously, send out a Trojan Alert! I live right at 27th and Hoover…would have been good to know!
Was an alert issued last night?
Seriously, what kind of incident would merit sending out an alert by DPS? Because this incident occurred “off campus” is USC saying this does not warrant issuing an alert? If more students were aware of what was happening then perhaps three attacks would not have occurred and some of the students would have been indoors. Any comments DPS?
How can DPS be so sure this incident isn’t gang-related when a gang was on campus tagging a restroom this past Friday/Saturday?
As yet another politically-correct entity, DPS doesn’t consider crimes committed BY gang-members to be “gang-related”, unless the victim is also a gang-member.   And while there are probably a handful of gang members in the USC student population, the odds of robbing three in one night are very very low.

Green groups at USC discussed  various initiatives on campus that aim to address issues such as waste, green buildings, water and energy, at a panel Tuesday.
USC’s sustainability rating was recently raised from a C+ to a B- by the Sustainability Endowments Institute, but many campus groups are still working to make the university greener.
Green · Eric Johnson, director of Facilities Management Services, and Daniela Arellano, green office liason for the Office of Sustainability, spoke about different ways to recycle and how to make buildings more energy efficient. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
Four of these groups — Net Impact, CalPIRG, the Office of Sustainability and Facilities Management Services — talked about some of their goals and projects Tuesday as part of the Campus Conversation Series.
Net Impact, a student group that lobbies for corporate responsibility and sustainability on campus, introduced a pilot program this semester that will have classrooms use reusable dry erase markers instead of Expos in classrooms.
“We will be implementing the program through Marshall School of Business next fall,” said Catherine Uong, a freshman majoring in business administration and secretary of Net Impact. “You will see the markers in classrooms then.”
This semester, CalPIRG, a political public interest group that has chapters at various schools, has worked on a plastic bag ban that has been adopted by unincorporated areas in Los Angeles, though not the city as a whole. The group is also working on clean car initiatives.
“One of our core campaigning efforts this year was our clean car initiatives … We’ve been campaigning to put one million more energy efficient cars on the road by 2025,” said David Mittelstein, the head of CalPIRG.
CalPIRG and Net Impact both have plans to raise awareness during Earth Week, which is next week. CalPIRG plans to show Chevrolet’s Volt as an exhibit and to talk about green technology. Net Impact plans to host a waste program at The Row, as well as a panel and a fashion show.
The Office of Sustainability and FMS have also made major accomplishments this year, but both hope to be able to do more.
“Our mission is to institutionalize sustainability by making sustainability part of the everyday work of the school by making it second nature,” said Daniela Arellano, a green office liason of the Office of Sustainability.
Arellano said the Office of Sustainability has worked with office leaders in various buildings to teach them how to make the buildings more energy efficient. Many buildings, such as the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, have earned LEED — Leader in Environmental and Energy Design certification, meaning they use water and energy efficiently.
Arellano also hopes USC can further decrease its emission of greenhouse gases.
There is currently a server in place that collects information to determine how much energy a building uses in a single day. Arellano said she hopes the information is used by students for research, and possibly as a part of competition to see which building can cut down its energy use the most.
FMS has also been working to help the environment by putting less waste in landfills.
Last year USC generated more than 7,800 tons of trash. Eric Johnson, director of FMS, said 51 percent was diverted from landfills by using a Material Recovery Facility to search for recyclable goods.
FMS has also bought a densifier that melts styrofoam to condense it and make it recyclable and has been working on landscaping.
“When we talk about landscapse there’s a lot of things we can do to be sustainable,” Johnson said. “In the last few years, whenever we did a project we incorporated green landscaping.”
In landscaping projects, organic mulch is used, which releases nitrogen for plants to use and helps them with nutrients. The group is also using dripline irrigation, a low flow irrigation system that directs more water to the plant with little running onto the sidewalk.
FMS is also using natural pruning and evapotranspiration to measure how much water is in the air.
FMS built a 3-million-gallon thermal energy tank under the track field in 2004. During off-peak hours when electricity is cheaper, the water is cooled down. When electricity is more expensive, the tank is used to provide electricity. Johnson said the project was expensive, but is paying for itself.
What about USC’s $3.7 billion endowment?  Is there any attempt to try to invest billions of dollars in companies that aren’t devastating the environment?  Probably not, as USC’s endowment is completely private information and that, generally, less environmentally friendly companies are more often more profitable.
how about spending more resources on providing more recycling bins and educating USC students on how/why to recycle instead of relying on a Material Recovery Facility to pull out recyclables…that way we’re encouraging long term environmental consciousness???

A growing number of college students are utilizing social media and networking to search for and secure jobs.
According to a survey last week from I Love Rewards, an employee recognition provider, and Experience Inc., a career services network, only 5 percent of college students planned to seek employment using LinkedIn last year. This year, however, almost 28 percent of college students intend to use LinkedIn to build a contact network and search for jobs.
USC’s Career Planning and Placement Center has also seen both LinkedIn and Facebook playing an increasingly important role in job searching.
“We don’t have any hard stats yet, but we emphasize that you need to use all your resources when searching for jobs,” said Lori Shreve Blake, director of Alumni and Student Career Services. “I do see a significant trend in that many of the recruiters are going to sites to look for candidates. LinkedIn is a great way to make connections with people.”
LinkedIn functions as an electronic resume, allowing college students and employers to constantly update their profiles. Profiles include sections such as pictures, summary, current work, work history and graduation information.
Some students agree it is a convenient resource.
“It’s a positive thing and will provide more opportunities in today’s day and age with technology. I feel like a lot of students will use it going forward,” said Gayane Karapetyan, a senior majoring in interdisciplinary archeology.
Although Facebook can be used for finding jobs, Marianne Encarnacion, a sophomore majoring in health and humanity, believes LinkedIn is a more useful alternative.
“I see social networking as something informal, but I think it’s a resourceful way to find people,” said Encarnacion. “Since LinkedIn is more formal, I think it’s a positive thing and produces conducive exchanges between people.”
Networking can be critical for landing jobs in today’s competitive job market, according to Henry Jenkins, provost’s professor at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and the School of Cinematic Arts.
“Students need to acquire skills at using social media to help them establish, maintain and go beyond their own core network of contacts. Sites like LinkedIn are designed for this purpose,” Jenkins said. “In many cases, professional opportunities will arise two to four degrees of separation [away] from the folks you know personally. Trading such contacts is a way that a cohort of classmates can help support each other’s personal and professional development.”
Jenkins also believes professional social networking is particularly useful to college students who are unsure of exactly where they want to work and live in the long run.
“Using social media also allows students to expand the geographic reach of their contacts, especially for those who are likely to need to relocate in search of professional opportunities but have not yet decided to invest heavily in any given city,” Jenkins said.
To educate students about how to use social media and present a professional image to employers, CPPC has held online webinars in the last several years, focusing on LinkedIn and the significance of personal branding.
CPPC also plans to conduct surveys of graduating seniors and hold focus groups for students to closely examine how social media is impacting the job market.
Lizzie Hares, a junior majoring in neuroscience, thinks networking is a key reason social media is beneficial in job searching, but students need to be educated on how to present a proper image.
“It’s good because it helps networking and building contacts with people you can’t meet [in person],” Hares said. “But, it has its negatives because employers can see bad things on your profile. Networking would be even better if people cleaned up their Facebooks and online profiles.”
College students are not alone in utilizing LinkedIn for professional networking. Employers also use the website to build their online representation and provide up-to-date information about their companies.
A survey by Monster.com, a job-search site, showed that more than 40 percent of employers said they will use “different” tactics to recruit today’s generation and 60 percent of those employers said social networking sites are among the most popular tools to utilize in recruiting are.
Utilizing social media is changing the face of the job market, as it represents a new way of recruiting, according to Blake.
There are other websites that employers use to find potential employees, such as Monster.com, but social networking sites such as LinkedIn allow employers to view profiles that contain information about their qualifications.
“Many employers are preferring to go to LinkedIn over Monster because that’s not tapping into the talent,” Blake said. “Employers are tired of going through resumes to find the right candidate and are becoming more focused in their recruiting methods.”
As enthralling of an article as the lead story in today’s paper is, I much rather would have seen something about TEDx (that huge, sold-out event that happened yesterday) on the front page…or anywhere in the entire paper…
Don’t worry, these strong skills of prioritization are probably something you can highlight on your LinkedIn profile as you use the Internet to find a job. Who knew kids did that these days?
But for the right individuals online degrees bend to personal schedules, are available 24/7, and may sustain the student that simply has no other choice, check out “High Speed Universities” for advantages and disadvantages of online degrees.
