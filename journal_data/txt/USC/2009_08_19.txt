USC’s defensive line is going to look very different from the unit that helped lead the 2008 Trojans to the nation’s No. 1 ranked scoring defense.
Instead of lining up tackle Fili Moala, a 2008 All-Pac-10 first team selection, and defensive ends Kyle Moore and Clay Matthews, the 2009 Trojans will turn to new faces and new leaders in the trenches to halt the opposition’s offensive attack.
Leading the chase · Defensive linemen Everson Griffen and Christian Tupou must stabilize a unit that lost major pieces to the NFL. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The line’s only returning full-time starter from last season is junior Christian Tupou at nose tackle, although junior end Everson Griffen has basically had the experience of a starter. Tupou started 10 games alongside Moala, Moore and Matthews, and he knows firsthand that this year’s defensive line has some big shoes to fill after losing three linemen to the NFL draft.
“It’s definitely going to be a challenge,” said Tupou, who recorded 12 tackles and one deflection in 2008. “We’re just a no-name defensive line, and we’re ready to get the job done. That’s where we stand now.”
Returning as defensive line coach after a 3-year stint coaching in the NFL is Jethro Franklin. The Fresno State graduate, who also coached the Trojans’ defensive line in 2005, said he returned to USC because he thinks an opportunity to be on a staff with coach Pete Carroll is too great to pass up.
A defensive line coach since 1991, Franklin has a lot of experience and wisdom to offer his players, and the linemen are happy to have him, said Griffen.
“The defensive line’s going good with Coach Franklin,” said Griffen, who recorded 18 tackles and 4.5 sacks in 2008 and was named a starter out of spring camp. “It’s way different. We’re more up-tempo. We’ve got better technique. It’s coming along real well.”
Tupou said he feels like working with Franklin is the right fit and that the line has adjusted favorably to his teaching methods.
“I enjoy it,” Tupou said. “I enjoy myself during practice. I enjoy what he has to teach. I’m already used to it.”
Expected to join Tupou and Griffen on USC’s 2009 starting defensive line are redshirt senior tackle Averell Spicer and sophomore defensive end Armond Armstead, who both won their jobs out of spring camp. Spicer started three games at nose tackle in 2008, but may be hindered by a sprained ankle he hurt in mid-August.
While this year’s group does have some experience, Franklin knows the defensive line has a lot of work ahead of it. But the coach does see a lot of potential in his players.
“They just have to keep working, and work together,” Franklin said. “[They have to] do what we ask them to do, and bring their God-given ability to the game. If we just do those things and take it one day at a time, one practice at a time, we’ll see what happens.”
Not only will the defensive line have to establish a new identity, but it will also have to find new leaders after losing a vocal, physical group of starters that combined for 222 tackles at the line throughout their USC careers.
Franklin feels, however, that the team will establish a leader as the season progresses.
“They’re doing the things that we’re asking them to do,” he said. “If we do that, some one is going to step out and emerge and be that guy. I’m not necessarily singling a guy out, per se, but it’ll happen naturally.”
Despite losing key players, the Trojans’ line still expects to be a force in 2009. Griffen feels that if he and the guys around him play at maximum effort, good things will happen.
“It’s always a challenge losing big guys…but that’s why we’ve got people to step in,” Griffen said. “At USC, we’ve got the best recruiting class. So when it’s your time to go, it’s time to go. It’s not a big factor. We’re just pushing through. It looks good right now.”

With fall football practice already underway, Trojan fans have a lot to speculate about. While the almost brand new defensive line and the juggling of quarterback talent are on the top of their lists, the special teams members’ newfound focus is causing a stir as well.
Leg up · Transfer Jacob Harfman has impressed coaches with his strong leg. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Over the years, one of the aspects missing from USC’s training regime has been a coach completely dedicated to special teams. After some searching, head coach Pete Carroll found Brian Schneider, the former Oakland Raiders special teams coordinator for the last two seasons.
“In the past we’ve had [a bunch of coaches] coaching us on the different aspects of our game,” redshirt junior kicker Joe Houston said. “Now we have one coach with that NFL experience that is totally centralized on special teams and focused, and really it’s a lot more dynamic.”
Senior Jordon Congdon, who will compete with Houston for the place-kicking position, shared similar sentiments about Schneider.
“It’s been going real smooth,” Congdon said. “We’re much more focused now with his coaching dynamic … With kickers, we only get one shot and we’re not taking anything lightly, even if it’s just one kick.”
“I don’t know if it’s much different,” Schneider said about the difference he is making with special teams. “I think just probably an emphasis on them, really.”
Carroll said he has the utmost confidence in Schneider and his ability to keep the players on the right track.
“Brian is a great guy with a great attitude and personality about him,” Carroll said. “And the guys have really taken to him.”
Similar to many positions on the Trojan roster, the special teams unit must replace players who have moved on. David Buehler was picked up by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round of the NFL draft. Making nine of 13 field goals and 65 of 66 extra points, his accuracy is something that the Trojans need to recreate.
The Trojans are also losing starting punter Greg Woidneck, who averaged 36.9 yards per punt last year. Woidneck graduated last year.
The battle for the punter spot is already heating up. Billy O’Malley seemed to have solidified the punter position before junior college transfer Jacob Harfman entered the mix. Harfman is also competitng in the battle for place kicker, which Schneider said was still undecided.
“All three of them are [looking good],” Schneider said about Congdon, Houston, and Harfman. “You’ve got all three of them out there, the ‘Three J’s,’ really, is what they are. They’re all doing a great job.”
Carroll said he was excited about what he saw from Harfman at the beginning of fall camp.
“Today was the first day we got to see Jake Harfman kick the ball,” he said. “Jake can really hit it, so that’s a needed part of the competition for that spot. I haven’t seen him kickoff yet, which is another needed part, but he punted the heck out of that ball.”
He also had a few things two say about the other “J’s” battling for the place kicking spot, even giving a minor prediction about the season outcome.
“Joe Houston and Congdon continue to just be rock solid getting the balls in close,” Carroll explained. “That might give us a chance to work those two guys into the competition with place kicks and Jake as the punter and kickoff guy, but we’ll see.”
Whatever conclusions Carroll and Schneider come to, the competition does not stop once the starters are revealed.
“When you come to USC, it’s not going to be some job that’s just going to be handed to you,” Houston said. “Even when someone is named the starter, there’s still going to be competition; there’s going to be two guys at your heels no matter what.”
Last season, junior Joe McKnight started as the punt returner until ball handling problems allowed senior Stafon Johnson to take the spot for the rest of the year with a 9.2 yards return average. McKnight seems dedicated and determined to regain his starting position, but he’ll have to prove it in practice.
Kick returners junior Ronald Johnson and redshirt junior C.J. Gable seem to be locking down their positions early in practice. Gable (who brought the ball back for 93 yards and a touchdown against Stanford last season) and Johnson both appear to be ready to begin where they left off last season. Redshirt freshman Curtis McNeal’s name, however, is one that has been tossed around by both Schneider and Carroll as potential competition for Johnson and Gable.

Jeff Byers is a towering figure. The 6-foot-3, 290-pound redshirt senior left guard is a force to be reckoned with on a Trojan offensive line already stacked with giants.
Yet in the case of Byers, his actions and words speak much louder than his stature. In maturity and intelligence, this Trojan towers above his teammates.
While some players react to big plays with arrogance and taunting, the easygoing, modest Byers plays his part with stoic intensity. As a pivotal part of one of the most highly touted offensive units in college football, Byers understands the unglamorous nature of his position, which is arguably football’s most grueling.
Not an ‘old man’ · Senior Jeff Byers will be practicing at Howard Jones Field for the sixth and final time this year. One of the oldest players on the team, Byers sets a good example on and off the field for his teammates. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
“I don’t really pay attention to being in the national spotlight,” Byers said. “We just come out here and work hard everyday. As linemen, who really cares, you know? I could care less what people think of me or what people think of our O-line because it’s not a glorified position … We get dirty, we get bloody and that’s just what we are. Whether the country knows about us or not, who cares? We do our job because we love it.”
Despite his best efforts to ignore the spotlight, the sixth-year senior has inevitably found himself the center of attention as the team’s most veteran player. In his conduct both on and off the field, Byers seems more than up to the task of playing mentor.
“I do feel like an old man,” Byers joked, grinning broadly. “You know, Josh Pinkard and myself have been here a long time. And I mean, it’s good to have those guys. I remember when I was a young guy and we had the old guys, you look to them to work hard. Every young guy needs a little guidance and I’m more than willing to give it if they want it.”
Offensive line coach Pat Ruel praised the team leader for his willingness to guide younger players and suggested that his experience makes practicing with him “like having an extra coach on the field.”
Starting junior center Kristofer O’Dowd echoed Ruel’s sentiments, discussing how Byers’ own experience as a center helped him get to where he stands today.
“He was one of those guys when I was younger he’d kind of settle me down, put an arm over me and just tell me, ‘Everything’s going well, everything’s okay. Just be calm, collected and you’ll get better every day.’ And I’ve taken that to heart,” O’Dowd said.
Such a long and storied college career could not come without hardship, however, and the main reason why the 23-year-old Byers was able to return for this season is a difficult injury history. The senior was sidelined for the better part of two years starting in 2005, with hip and back injuries during a long stretch of bench time he referred to as the hardest part of his athletic career.
“When I was hurt and getting back, something that you love is taken away from you and it’s always hard to sit back on the sidelines and watch and know that you can’t be out there,” Byers said. “You get mind games played with yourself and you’re always questioning whether ‘Am I okay or am I not okay?’ It’s just a constant battle to say, ‘I got to keep going. I got to keep working.’”
The silver lining buried beneath the physical and psychological difficulties Byers faced on the bench was the chance it gave the fiercely intelligent student athlete to focus on an area in which football players rarely distinguish themselves: academics.
“I had a great opportunity when I was injured to get ahead in school, and Marshall’s one of the best programs in the country,” said Byers, a business administration major. “It just seemed like a natural fit. Business is something I want to do.”
When asked if he had ever been approached by his teammates for financial advice, Byers laughed, responding, “If we had any money, I think they might.”
Despite his everlasting modesty, Byers’ financial savvy has become the stuff of legend around the locker room. In a famous story, head coach Pete Carroll even asked Byers to explain the 2008 financial meltdown to his teammates ­— with what Ruel described as decidedly mixed results.
“He did a very nice job, but there were some guys in the room scratching their heads because he’s a little farther ahead than most of us are on that subject,” Ruel said, laughing. “But the fact of the matter is that Jeff’s very articulate and he’s very well-spoken, and he does a nice job of explaining things.”
Ruel also explained that Byers’ willingness to push his academics as far as his athletics is merely indicative of his driven personality.
“He’s always getting things done,” Ruel said emphatically. “He’s a doer. He’s either working on his M.B.A., he’s working on business ideas or he’s out here working on being an excellent football player. I mean, there’s no grass growing underneath this guy’s feet.”
Now, the always-advancing Byers, as big and strong as he’s ever been, heads into the 2009 football season with the benefit of a full offseason, something Carroll remarked Byers hadn’t had since before the seasons he was sidelined with injuries.
“He looks great. He’s in great shape. He feels great and hopefully he can have the good fortune of being healthy through camp and then it’ll be really obvious why coming back was the right thing to do and all,” Carroll said. “This is his first chance to really express his ability with the background of a good offseason.”
Even though he’s always moving forward, summer practice offered Byers a chance to reflect on his long career as a Trojan. The veteran said that his strongest memories spring not from any of the big games he participated in — Byers was even a starter in the 2004 national championship game — but rather out of the practice field where he spent long California afternoons with several generations of players.
“It’s incredible to think how many guys I’ve been blessed to play with that have moved on to bigger and better things,” Byers reminisced. “Sam Baker, Ryan Kalil, Deuce Lutui — all guys that are probably some day going to be All-Pros in the NFL. Reliving memories with those guys, you never get — these practice fields especially — you never get those days back.”
As for his future, the pragmatic Byers harbors dreams of playing at the next level, which Ruel suggested are well within reach. On his NFL goals, the lineman displayed one final bit of modesty, suggesting the place he wants to end up is “wherever anybody wants me.”
“I can only go out and play hard and do what I know how to do, which is hustle and finish and wherever that takes me, it takes me,” Byers said, smiling. “If the NFL wants me, I’ll go there. Of course it’s my goal and my dream. And you’ve got to stay healthy and you’ve got to play hard and it’s out of my control. All I can do is what I can do: work hard, play hard, finish. And we’ll see where that takes me.”

With concerns over the Trojans’ future looming after the departure of such mainstays as Rey Maualuga, Brian Cushing and Mark Sanchez, the potentially unstable Trojans can look to one reliable unit as a source of balance: the offensive line.
The already-experienced unit sacrificed none of its 2008 starters to either the NFL or lasting injury in the offseason. Understandably, such a veteran group of players arrive with hype proclaiming them the best O-line in the nation.
Big assets · The Trojans’ offensive line should be one of the deepest in the nation, a huge advantage to whoever ends up playing quarterback. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan 
Naturally, offensive line coach Pat Ruel doesn’t buy into any of that kind of talk.
“Let me tell you something, you’re only as good as your last play and what you did,” Ruel said. “There’s too many times when people talk about how good you are and you start listening to it and then you’re not working as hard as you should.”
Regardless, the affable Ruel budged a little when pressed about the talent and experience of his boys.
“We have a chance to be a very good offensive line, and it’s going to be determined by how much hard work we put in and how well we prepare, and their attitude,” Ruel said.
Sixth-year senior left guard Jeff Byers agreed with Ruel about the real value of hype.
“Rankings mean nothing at the beginning of the season. The toughest challenge for a line is to perform week in and week out,” Byers said. “Offensive line’s a real special position in that every week it’s a different challenge.”
When asked about any potential weaknesses in the offensive line, Ruel wryly replied “coaching,” before continuing to offer some criticism of his highly touted players.
“I think that right now we’re behind in some pass protection stuff. We’re not clean on picking up some stuff. We’re there, but we just need to fundamentally get there,” Ruel said.
Despite Ruel’s concerns over his line’s protection against the pass rush, coach Pete Carroll expressed confidence in the unit’s ability to protect the man behind center.
“Our quarterbacks couldn’t ask for a better supporting crew around them,” Carroll said.
Junior center Kristofer O’Dowd, who was sidelined during spring practices with a torn labrum in his left shoulder, remained the one major question mark on the roster. At summer practice, O’Dowd confirmed he had been fully cleared to play. The 2008 All-Pac-10 player said that he was “confident” in the offensive line’s ability to excel.
“No one left and we’re a smarter group. Things come a lot easier and we can work on smaller details of our game to be a better unit and help this offense and help this team become our best,” O’Dowd said.
O’Dowd also denied any nervousness among his fellow starters over the upcoming game at Ohio State, simultaneously offering high praise to his daily opponents on the practice field.
“The only defensive unit we’re worried about is the defensive unit we go against every day,” O’Dowd said. “That is the best defense in the country. ”
Until this season, Ruel said, the offensive line only ever had eight or nine players in total from year to year. Ruel explained that one benefit of the unit’s retention of all of its starters has been the value of their experience to the team’s new recruits.
“We’ve finally got our numbers up a little bit, and now everybody’s talking about how we’ve got a really good talent base,” Ruel said. “Well, that’s what we want. We want our older players now to teach our younger players how to play, how to be competitors, how to be winners and how to be champions.”
Both Ruel and Carroll expressed satisfaction with the level of competition between veterans like O’Dowd and Byers and freshmen up-and-comers such as Khaled Holmes and Matt Kalil, the younger brother of former All-American Trojan center Ryan Kalil.
“We’ve got a lot of guys battling for playing time that are worthy of playing,” Carroll said. “They’re tough. They’re big enough. They’re smart football players … Now it’ll be really interesting to see if they can’t make a pitch for their playing time.”

Technical foul · Coach Tim Floyd resigned shortly after he was accused of handing at least $1,000 cash to a member of former star O.J. Mayo’s inner circle in February 2007. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
TGIFS — Thank God it’s Football Season.
Thank God we have football season to numb our senses, tunnel our vision and help us forget about life outside the Coliseum. Because once December comes knocking, we will look outside the structure that hosted the grandest sporting event in the world — where hope, joy and optimism are found stitched in every flag — only to find despair, corruption and emptiness. And that’s just in our men’s basketball program.
In case you aren’t familiar with the recent developments of the USC basketball program, let’s go back to March 22, 2009. With less than two minutes left in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, the 10th-seeded Trojans were down by two to the second-seeded Spartans of Michigan State. USC guard Daniel Hackett stole the ball and raced up court for the game-tying layup. But on the way, he lost the ball and with it USC’s dream of reaching the Final Four.
It’s ironic, looking back, on how it all played out, how the two teams in that game would end up going in complete opposite directions. Michigan State would go on to play in the national championship. After that crushing loss, USC would lose three players early to the professional ranks, its head coach and most of its recruits, but, most importantly of all, its dignity and possible appearances in future postseasons.
And all this is the result of one man who was playing in Memphis last season, O.J. Mayo.
You might recall O.J. Mayo. He was the highly publicized six-star recruit (if there ever was one) who decided not to play at powerhouses such as North Carolina, Duke or UCLA and instead made the curious decision to play at a school that had very little pull in the world of college basketball, USC.
For the 2007-08 season, Mayo captivated Trojan fans as arguably the most talented player ever to dribble a basketball in cardinal and gold. But then Louis Johnson, a former confidant of Mayo, made allegations that Mayo’s inner circle buddies, including Rodney Guillory, received about $250,000 from a sports agency. Johnson said that Guillory gave Mayo some of that money, which he used to buy clothes, a TV and other accessories.
NCAA investigations started then and are still continuing, but no official action has been taken against USC. The Trojans finished last season knowing that they could go to unprecedented heights next year, if everyone stuck around.
“If there is some way we can keep them together and add what we have coming back next year, we’ve got a chance to be a special team,” then-coach Tim Floyd said after the Michigan State loss.
But Floyd didn’t do anything to help his cause. Soon after the loss to Michigan State, he visited Arizona and interviewed for its head coach vacancy. He declined, but the loyalty his players felt to him hopped on that flight to Arizona and never came back.
After that, the landslide began. Freshman sensation DeMar DeRozan and juniors Taj Gibson and Daniel Hackett all entered the NBA Draft (DeRozan and Gibson were selected in the first round, Hackett went undrafted), and senior Marcus Johnson left the school even after the NCAA granted him a rare sixth year of eligibility. Johnson’s departure finally made Floyd lose his cool, “Our guys get an offer from Islamabad and they’re gone,” he quipped.
These decisions to leave were influenced by Floyd’s interview, but also by a serious allegation that was made in May, when Louis Johnson came out again and said that Floyd gave Guillory $1,000 in February 2007 to spend at the All-Star weekend in Las Vegas.
Johnson told Yahoo! Sports that he thinks the money Floyd gave Guillory was a thank you “for Guillory’s efforts in delivering [Mayo to sign with USC].” Regardless of the intent, the money would be considered an extra benefit for Mayo, which is an NCAA violation. That was the final straw for Floyd, and it signaled the end of the USC basketball program as we know it, as one that had gone to a program-record three straight NCAA tournaments.
The NCAA turned up the heat and combined the basketball and football investigations. On June 9, Floyd, the man who made the football offseason a lot shorter for USC fans, resigned. Floyd cited lost enthusiasm for the job, and he left behind a program that will be feeling the repercussions of the O.J. Mayo saga for years to come.
USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett and the university didn’t even blink an eye and reacted as if they expected this. One can’t help but think that the allegations made by Johnson, combined with the NCAA investigation and Floyd’s resignation, were more than just a coincidence.
With all this in mind, and knowing the USC basketball program will most likely face disciplinary repercussions, recruits decommitted from USC quicker than you can say “disgraceful.”
First went Solomon Hill, who decided to go to Arizona instead. Then went highly ranked Noel Johnson from Georgia. Lamont Jones of Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy and Derrick Williams followed suit. In all, USC lost eight recruits, and only Evan Smith decided to stay.
Amid all this, the Trojans were also searching for a new coach, which isn’t easy in May and June. Pittsburgh’s Jamie Dixon was the only high profile coach that the Trojans pursued, and he quickly declined even though California is his home state.
So Garrett settled on Kevin O’Neill. You probably recall taunting him as he was walking off the bus into the Galen Center when he was the interim head coach at Arizona two years ago.
O’Neill has an extensive coaching background. He’s been the head coach at Tennessee, Marquette, Northwestern and Arizona, as well as the NBA’s Toronto Raptors. Last season he was an assistant for the Memphis Grizzlies. Unfortunately, he has lost a lot more than he has won. Still, during his last stint as an NCAA head coach, with Arizona in 2007-08, he went 19-15 and made the NCAA tournament, albeit with players legendary coach Lute Olsen recruited.
O’Neill is not a household name, and he shouldn’t be expected to rebuild the Trojans overnight. But already he has brought in a few recruits, and he has made more foreign visits than President Obama. O’Neill has gone from Montenegro to the island of Rhodes to visit every single current Trojans player and assure them of his promise to build a good, clean and competitive basketball program.
“I recognize that USC basketball has been through a tough time lately,” O’Neill said. “…I’m sure I am also going to be asked whether the NCAA investigation involving basketball is going to hurt recruiting or the program in general. Let me just say that if I thought I wouldn’t be able to do my job — do the job that the university expects of me and equally important that I expect of myself — I wouldn’t have taken the job.”
In two months, USC went from a top five team to a team that would struggle in the Patriot League. It seemed too good to be true: to have Hackett, Gibson and DeRozan come back and join the powerful recruiting class and make USC relevant in basketball. But in the end, everybody was just dreaming.
Now, Trojan fans have awoken to the harsh reality of the situation. But if there’s any silver lining in this, it lies in three returners that have game: senior guard Dwight Lewis, who averaged 14.4 points per game last year, sophomore forward Leonard Washington (which star player will he bring down next?) and former UNC big man redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson.
This isn’t Indiana, which was leveled with NCAA penalties a year ago and welcomed back Kyle Taber as their leading scorer with a whopping 1.3 points per game. Yet the Hoosiers still managed to sell out Assembly Hall as their basketball team went 4-17. O’Neill is no Tom Crean, but in light the situation, the best Trojan fans can do is head over to the Galen Center and bring in all that hope, joy and optimism from the Coliseum.
The USC men’s basketball program certainly needs it.

Their time · Redshirt junior Michael Morgan (right) is the only linebacker returning to a unit that lost all of its talent to the NFL draft. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
Legacy and tradition.
These are two things that have always defined USC and Trojan football.
Perhaps no part of the team better epitomizes these terms than the linebackers, who for years have been regarded as the heart of Trojan football. Last season the Trojans boasted the triple threat of Brian Cushing, Rey Maualuga and Kaluka Maiava.
This season, that entire unit has moved on to the NFL. Some would regard this as a rebuilding year for the Trojan defense, but with a program like USC, which has long history of formidable defenses, there is no such thing as a rebuilding year.
“We don’t rebuild, we reload,” said redshirt junior Michael Morgan.
Coach Pete Carroll knows and acknowledges that Trojan fans everywhere will have their eyes on the linebacker unit to see if they can step up and fill the shoes of three Trojan greats.
Waiting to do just that are junior Malcolm Smith, redshirt sophomore Chris Galippo and Morgan.
“These guys have been chomping at the bit and you can see it in the linebackers,” Carroll said. “They feel like there’s something to prove and they know they’re in a situation where there’s a lot of people watching for what’s going to happen.”
Smith, who was one of the spring’s top performers, will fill in at the weakside linebacker position. Smith recognizes that while he and the other linebackers have been held in the wings the past few seasons, they’re being called upon now for good reason.
“It’s the same thing: work hard every day, the coach is good, they recruited us for a reason because they expected us to play one day,” Smith said.
Smith expects to show the nation that the linebackers are as strong and determined as ever.
“Most definitely, that’s the tone we’re trying to set out here, let everybody know that’s where the passion is at, our position,” he said.
Smith is also confident in his teammates’ abilities to fill in for him if need be.
“We have Jordan [Campbell], Shane [Horton] and Marquis [Simmons], so we have a nice depth at my position,” he said.
Campbell, a redshirt sophomore, will compete with Smith for the position throughout the season. Senior Dan Deckas and freshman Simmons will also compete for playing time.
Galippo will play middle linebacker. Much of the focus around Galippo recently has been about his drop in weight. This may help increase his speed on the field, which is an advantange the linebackers as unit should enjoy this season.
Galippo feels that the unit will be strong this season especially since they test their abilities against the Trojan offense every day.
“It’s good for us because we’re going against the number one offense in the nation every single day and by the time we get out of the camp and go strap up in the Coliseum, we’re ready,” he said.
Carroll recognizes that Galippo is a real leader amongst the unit and this season may be his season to shine.
“This is the best he’s been, he’s in the best shape and he’s really mentally on it and he’s ready to have a really solid camp and lead us into the season,” Carroll said. “He’s really running the show out there, we’re lucky to have him.”
Carroll also acknowledged that Galippo has something last season’s linebackers lacked.
“He’s a better communicator than any of the guys last year,” he said. “Rey, Cush, all those guys were not in as much command as he is.”
Competing for playing time at the middle linebacker position will be sophomore Uona Kavienga and freshman Jarvis Jones. Jones in particular has been a standout at camp thus far, according to Carroll.
“He came out here and played outside backer today and that’s a tremendous accomplishment for only three days of camp,” Carroll said of Jones. “He’s already played the two spots and looked good at both of them.”
At strongside linebacker, Morgan will take the field. He brings a lot of speed to the position, running a 4.3 40-yard-dash.
“I think we’re a lot faster than those guys were, so we’re going to use that to our advantage,” Morgan said. Morgan started one game last season, while appearing in 12. Morgan has redshirt senior Luthur Brown, redshirt senior Nick Garratt and freshman Kevin Greene backing him up.
The linebackers believe that they are still the heart of Trojan football.
“We’re always going to be the heart. This is LBU as we all say here at this great university,” Morgan said.
“I’m just ready for that first kickoff, ready to go down there, make some plays and just ball out. It’s going to be a great season and I can’t wait.”

Been there · Sure-handed junior receiver Damian Williams, seen here catching a touchdown pass in the Rose Bowl against Penn State, should be the go-to guy this season. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
Replacing Mark Sanchez as the Trojans’ starting quarterback might be difficult, but the transition to first-string signal-caller for either Aaron Corp or Matt Barkley will be made easier by a talented and veteran group of pass catchers.
Leading receiver Damian Williams returns to the gridiron this season alongside the No. 3 man from a year ago, junior Ronald Johnson, as does starting tight end senior Anthony McCoy.
Williams, a redshirt junior, played his first season for the Trojans last year after transferring from Arkansas. He made quite a first impression, catching 58 balls for 869 yards and nine touchdowns, and enters the season regarded as one of the best wideouts in the nation. Williams is also looking to fill some of the leadership role left by wide receiver Patrick Turner, a second-team All-Pac-10 selection in 2008 who now plays for the Miami Dolphins.
“He’s a leader. He shows [teammates] how to practice, how to do things,” offensive coordinator John Morton said of Williams. “That’s what leaders are supposed to do.”
Williams, who stands at 6-foot-1, is a solid route runner with good speed and great hands: a tough cover for most any corner.
Johnson, a big-play specialist with blazing speed, will step into the starting role opposite Williams. Now in his junior season, Johnson’s comfort level in the offense has grown immensely.
“I don’t have to think before I start my plays,” Johnson said. “It’s a lot easier because I just go and do it.”
“Ro-Jo,” as he is affectionately known by fans and teammates alike, caught 33 passes for 570 yards last season for an astonishing 17.3 yards per catch. He also scored eight touchdowns and is fifth all-time on the school’s kickoff return yardage list.
The Trojan offense is designed to feature only three receivers for a majority of the games, which makes the competition this fall for the third spot that much more intense.
The leading candidate seems to be redshirt junior David Ausberry, whose 6-foot-4 frame will provide a big target for the inexperienced quarterbacks. His 32 career catches represent the most out of the receivers vying for the third spot.
“I’m one of the older guys now so they’re going to be counting on me more,” Ausberry said. “[My goal] is just being more consistent.”
His comments seem to echo Morton’s, who described what he was looking for in a third receiver as “a guy that’s consistent and makes a lot of plays.”
Also in the competition is redshirt junior Travon Patterson. A former track star at Long Beach Poly High School, Patterson has speed to burn but only seven career college receptions to his credit.
Jordan Cameron, a redshirt junior whose path to USC has featured stops at BYU and Ventura Junior College, often impresses in practice and his 6-foot-5 frame means he has a similar build to Ausberry. He also plays for the USC basketball team and brings many of his hoops skills to the football field.
“I’m not too fast but I can get up the field and I can jump a little bit,” Cameron said. “My [biggest strength] is my overall athleticism.”
Cameron played in six games last season but made no catches.
Redshirt freshman Brice Butler and redshirt sophomore Brandon Carswell will also battle for playing time. They, along with true freshman De’Von Flournoy, looked poised to have bright careers in the years ahead based on their performances so far.
McCoy returns for his second season as the starting tight end after catching 22 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown a year ago. At 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, he’ll be a big target in the passing game as well as an effective blocker.
“[The tight ends] have got to block, we’ve got to catch, we’ve just got to be able to do it all,” backup tight end Rhett Ellison said. “[McCoy] brings everything to the table.”
Ellison, a redshirt sophomore, caught four passes last year but says he enjoys the blocking aspect the most.
Sophomore Blake Ayles was off to a great start last season, including a touchdown catch against Ohio State, before a knee injury limited his effectiveness for the rest of the year. He is now fully recovered and has impressed coaches during fall practice with his sure hands and dynamic running after the catch.
With the depth returning at wide receiver and the experience at tight end, whoever ends up starting at quarterback for the Trojans will have many targets to choose from this fall.

No. 1 · The USC men’s tennis teams celebrates their championship victory. The Trojans had to take down No. 1 Virginia and No. 3 Ohio State. - John Eilts | USC Sports Information 
For many, summer is a time to relax, get away from it all and take your mind off things. But for some USC athletes and teams, this summer was all about competition and, in some cases, the chance to win a national title. Just about every Trojan team that competed over the summer found success in national or conference tournaments. From the men’s tennis team to track and field, here’s what you missed in the world of USC sports while you were away this summer.
Men’s Tennis
The USC men’s tennis team, although sometimes under the radar even with its 16 national titles going into the 2009 season, made some noise this summer at the NCAA Men’s Tennis Championships.
Going in as the No. 8 seed, the Trojans eased through the first three rounds of the 64-team tournament to match up against No. 1 Virginia in the quarterfinals.
The Cavaliers, undefeated prior to the NCAAs, struggled against the Trojan attack, falling to USC’s top singles players, senior Abdullah Magdas, junior Robert Farah and freshman Steve Johnson en route to a 4-0 sweep of the Cavs by the Trojans.
After continuing its run in the semifinals by defeating Texas 4-1, USC faced Ohio State in the national championship event on May 16.
Against the No. 3 Buckeyes, the Trojans pulled out the doubles point on the strength of victories by doubles teams Farah/Johnson and duo freshman Matt Kecki and sophomore Jaak Poldma.
USC (25-5) continued to surprise the Buckeyes in the singles matches as Magdas and freshman Daniel Nguyen delivered the Trojans their first two singles points. After Poldma fell to Buckeye Justin Kronauge, the Trojans clinched the national title with Farah’s three-set victory, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4.
The championship is the Trojan’s 17th in school history and first for coach Peter Smith.
Men’s Volleyball
The men’s volleyball team, picked to finish sixth in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation entering the 2009 season, more than surpassed expectations by winning the MPSF tournament.
Facing defending national champion Penn State in the semifinals of the NCAA Championship, the No. 3 Trojans defeated the Nittany Lions, 3-1, with the help of freshman Murphy Troy. His 24 kills led the team and paced them for a .484 hitting percentage, which the Nittany Lions could not overcome.
USC faced UC Irvine in the final on May 9, a team that has traditionally given the Trojans nightmares on the volleyball court but whom the Trojans had blanked just 10 days before in the MPSF tournament in Irvine.
In the five-set match that saw USC (21-11) take an early 2-1 led after the first three sets, the Anteaters were able to answer with a blowout fourth set victory, 30-17. In the final set, the Trojans finished just short, falling 15-12 and finishing the season as national runner-up.
Women’s Water Polo
USC women’s water polo, ranked first in the nation for much of the season and with just one blemish on its 24-1 overall record, entered the 2009 Women’s Water Polo Championship as the favorite.
Breezing through their first two opponents, Cal Lutheran and the University of Hawaii by a combined score of 39-7, the Women of Troy were matched against third-ranked UCLA in the championship game on May 10.
After falling behind quickly in the first quarter 2-0, senior driver Michelle Stein scored two goals to even the score at 2-2. But a goal near the end of the period by UCLA’s senior Anne Belden left the Women of Troy trailing after the first period.
Junior driver Alexandra Kiss quickly answered with another goal by the Bruins in the second quarter, but another goal by UCLA to close out the half was too much to overcome and a second half goal by junior Forel Davies was not enough to complete the comeback, as USC (26-2) fell to UCLA 5-4.
Women’s and Men’s Golf
Both the men’s and women’s golf teams participated in the NCAA Championships in late May with results that fell slightly short of expectations.
The Women of Troy, ranked third in the nation coming into the NCAA tournament, started the tournament hot and were sitting pretty in second place going into the final stages of the team stroke-play match.
The third round proved even more fruitful for the team, as they took the overall lead with just 18 holes remaining on the strength of a 6-over 294 and freshman Jennifer Song’s individual 1-under-par 71.  Yet on the final day, the team shot a 13-over-par 301 to finish just short of the championship in third place behind eventual champions Arizona State.
On the men’s side, USC made it through the stroke-play event, which seeds teams for a match-play championship event. The Trojans, led by coach Chris Zambri, were unable to advance past the quarterfinal stage, bowing out to the University of Texas, 3-2.
The result was USC’s third top-10 finish in the past five events. This year’s effort was propelled by a group that was missing All-American junior Jamie Lovemark, who succumbed to a season-ending injury that held him out of the national competition, making the result all the more surprising and encouraging.
Track and Field
USC also found success at the track this June, with both the men’s and women’s teams finishing in the top 10 at the NCAA Track and Field Championships.
Helping lead the men’s track and field team to a 10th-place overall finish was junior Ahmad Rashad, whose second place finish at the NCAAs in the 100-meter dash in a paltry 10.10 seconds was the fastest time in that event by a Trojan since 1985.
The Women of Troy found the points that helped them to an eighth place overall finish in freshman Dalilah Muhammad, whose 56.49 in the 400-meter hurdles was the third fastest in school history and was also good enough for second place at the NCAAs.
u
Out of the seven teams that competed into the summer months, USC logged a national championship, two national runner-up finishes and four national top-10 finishes to round off an impressive and eventful summer.

Pressure released · The comparisons to Reggie Bush have finally subsided for junior Joe McKnight, who now looks to maximize his time in the Trojans’ crowded backfield. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
Running backs at USC have a lot to live up to. Nicknamed “Tailback U,” the Trojans have had some of the greatest rushers in NCAA history, including five Heisman Trophy winners.
It is no surprise, then, that the Trojans have one of the deepest backfields in the nation set to take the field in 2009. Many Trojans believe that all six of their top tailbacks could star at most Division-I programs. USC ranked 22nd in the nation last season in rushing offense at 195 yards per game, and returns all of its tailbacks and fullbacks.
The Trojans employed a three-man rotation at the tailback position for most of last season, with senior Stafon Johnson, redshirt junior C.J.. Gable and junior Joe McKnight getting more than 80 percent of the carries. However, the coaches remained noncommittal when asked if they would use a similar rotation this year.
“I don’t know how the rotation is going to go this year. We never know,” running backs coach Todd McNair said.
“We’ll see how it pans out,” added offensive coordinator John Morton. “Usually they’ll all play.”
Johnson was the Trojans leading rusher a season ago (705 yards, nine touchdowns) and enters his senior season tentatively atop the depth chart. He combines an ability to run between the tackles with a breakaway speed to become perhaps the Trojans’ most complete back. Yet Johnson said he has no complaints about the rotation.
“No problem at all because for the most part we were successful with it,” Johnson said.
He also dispelled the notion that one running back needs to get a majority of the carries in order to get in a rhythm.
“You want to be hot so you don’t have to get hot,” Johnson said. “That’s the mindset you’ve got to have.”
McKnight entered his first fall camp two years ago under immense pressure to fill the void left by the stylistically similar Reggie Bush. His first two years have been solid, though not as spectacular as some fans had hoped. McKnight seems poised, however, to have his best season yet in 2009, entering camp fully healthy after recovering from four dislocated toes suffered in January’s Rose Bowl.
“It feels so good to be healthy [for] the first season in my USC Trojan career,” McKnight said. “I’m more relaxed, more comfortable. I couldn’t really say I was having fun my first two years, but now I’m really having fun.”
McKnight was second in rushing on the team with 659 yards and led USC with 7.4 yards per rush. He is also dangerous in the passing game, catching 21 passes last year, and often lines up as a slot receiver. The one statistical knock on McKnight is his lack of finding the end zone, with only seven touchdowns in his career.
Gable is coming off some late-season struggles from a year ago, when he was benched for fumbling in games against UCLA and in the Rose Bowl against Penn State. Gable expressed frustration at the time with the coaches’ decision to leave him out but once again figures to be in line for a lot of carries.
“Why wouldn’t he be? He’s the first freshman running back in USC history to start and he’s started since his freshman year,” McNair said. “Yeah, a couple games the ball got away from him, but he’s good to go.”
Gable brings a lot of experience to the group, with 18 career starts. He rushed for 617 yards and eight scores last season.
Redshirt junior Allen Bradford, who was forced to sit out most of last year with a hip injury, is also back and ready to contribute. Though he doesn’t have more than 15 carries a season during his career, Bradford brings a power-running style that the top three backs don’t possess.
“I’m just trying to break the rotation, make it a fourth guy,” Bradford said. “[I want to] be the power guy.”
Redshirt sophomore Marc Tyler and redshirt freshman Curtis McNeal will also compete for playing time. Tyler is a big back who rushed for 198 yards a season ago, getting most of his touches once the game was decided. He had an impressive showing in spring practice, but so did McNeal. The 5-foot-8 speedster was the Trojans’ leading rusher in spring scrimmage.
The starting fullback position will once again be manned by redshirt junior Stanley Havili. Once a tailback in high school, Havili was converted to a fullback, where he has flourished in both the blocking and receiving game, catching passes out of the backfield with his blend of soft hands and speed. He has 596 career receiving yards and eight touchdowns.
“I try to bring another dimension to this offense, try to be a threat when I’m outside receiving the ball,” Havili said. “I can create matchup problems when I go one-on-one with linebackers.”
During the 2008 season, the coaches moved D.J. Shoemate to the fullback position to help backup Havili. Now entering his sophomore year, Shoemate possesses similar pass-catching qualities that now define the position for USC. Senior Adam Goodman will be a reserve fullback used mostly to block.

In the constantly evolving world of college football, how long can one team so fixed in its ways stay on top?
Every year the Trojans must endure a roster overhaul, a change that requires USC coach Pete Carroll to tinker his style ever so slightly. But when the philosophy remains the same year in and year out, the striking similarities between Trojan teams past and present outweigh the subtle differences.
“We have a great challenge ahead of us this year, but we’re going about it in the same way,” Carroll said. “This is nothing new for us.”
There has been little revolution in USC football since the program first replaced Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart and the stars of its last championship-level team. That’s probably fine by Carroll, who has preached the same message of eliminating mistakes on offense and creating turnovers on defense to guide his team to seven straight Pac-10 titles.
What has changed during the course of USC’s run is everything that surrounds the program. Washington State, the last team to beat out USC for a spot in the Rose Bowl, now sits at the bottom of the conference. Cal, once a perennial flounder in the standings, has turned itself into one of USC’s closest competitors.
With new commissioner Larry Scott, the Pac-10 is looking to reinvent itself in order to put the conference in the same discussion of college football’s elite with the SEC and the Big 12. For the other nine teams in the conference, the mission starts with knocking Carroll and Co. off their pedestals.
Even though USC has been the class of West Coast football since 2003, the Trojans have needed some help recently to keep their run going. It took an Oregon State loss to Oregon in the final week to assure that USC won the Pac-10 outright and would go to the Rose Bowl. The Trojans’ run looked like it was finally over in 2007 after losing to Oregon, but a late-season collapse by the Ducks on the heels of an injury to Dennis Dixon gave way to another conference title for USC.
“USC has set a very high standard, but it’s getting harder for them to match up team for team in this conference,” Arizona coach Mike Stoops said at Pac-10 media day. “Each team is getting better and giving USC their best shot every time, and it’s getting harder.”
That’s not to say that pessimists predicting an end of an era will be patting themselves on the back come bowl season. Only four of the 32 voters in the preseason Pac-10 poll dared to tab a team other than USC as tops in the Pac-10, and the Trojans should be favored in every game they play this season.
What an improved conference and challenging schedule does mean for USC, though, is that there’s a smaller margin of error. But if that can keep the Trojans on their toes, it might be the additional spark the team has been looking for over the past three years.
Even if the Trojans have proved they are the best of the Pac-10, they have yet to demonstrate they can navigate the conference schedule without having an out-of-body experience against an unexpected foe.
“I don’t think there’s a lot of magic to beating [USC],” said Oregon State coach Mike Riley, whose team has taken down the Trojans in two of the last three meetings. “Our defense had to disrupt them and we had to play a really, really efficient game. Lasting against those guys is the hardest part.”
Hmm, sound familiar to anyone? Pac-10 coaches are finally adopting the defensive-centered, run-oriented agenda that took the Trojans to the top and kept them there for so many years. The conference of quarterbacks has become the center for smashmouth football, with almost every coach at Pac-10 media day insisting that any competitive team will need to be able to hold on to the ball and stop teams up front on defense.
The rest of the conference catching up to USC is great for Pac-10 football, and it might even be good news for USC. Complacency has been as big of an adversary as anyone on the schedule, but the challenges awaiting the Trojans this season might help eradicate it. Four of the first six games are on the road and the away games provide the toughest tests of the season.
If USC is undefeated by November, a month in which Carroll has not lost since arriving at USC, they face four teams likely struggling to gain bowl eligibility.
Previous losses have kept USC out of the national championship, but a loss this year could give another Pac-10 team the opening they’ve been waiting for the last seven years.
“I don’t think we’re at the end of this run. I’d like to think we’re somewhere toward the middle,” Carroll said when asked to muse about how far he has brought the program since his arrival. “The challenge for us now is to create the discipline to stay on task and stay with what has made us.”
With an improved Pac-10, Carroll’s message might be as important as ever. If his team is able to demonstrate that commitment for 12 Saturdays during the regular season instead of 11, it will be making the last step forward that has eluded it for the last three years.
Call it the final stage of the evolution.

Golden opportunity · Freshman Matt Barkley has shown Pete Carroll he can handle the starting job. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan 
After naming redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp the starting quarterback at the end of spring practice, coach Pete Carroll emphasized that Corp still had to fend off true freshman Matt Barkley once fall camp started.
Since no quarterback under Carroll has ever before relinquished the starting role after being named in the spring, few doubted that Corp would be the guy suiting up Sept. 5 against San Jose State. That was until Aug. 10, the third day of fall practice, when Corp suffered a cracked upper fibula after a teammate rolled into his left knee during a drill.
No ligaments were torn, making the official timetable on Corp’s return only one to two weeks, that would bring him back in plenty of time to get ready for the Trojans’ first game. But it certainly did substantially shake up the quarterback competition, opening the door for Barkley to really make a run at the starting job.
The 18-year-old displayed poise uncharacteristic for a player his age the day the news about Corp’s injury became official, saying he did not feel added pressure.
“No I don’t think there’s pressure on me at all, at least I don’t feel any,” he said. “It’s just exciting. I love football and this is a chance, this is an opportunity that’s been placed in front of me and I just have to grab hold of it.”
Barkley’s number one fan seems to be Carroll, who has raved about the former Mater Dei High School standout since the day spring practice started. Barkley enrolled early at USC, allowing him to take part in spring workouts, a decision that has paid off extraordinarily in hindsight.
“Everything about him is a quarterback: his makeup, his mentality, his confidence, his vision, his savvy, all of that,” Carroll said. “So he’s just remarkably equipped. We’ve seen a lot of great players just struggle for a couple years, but he’s not in that mode.”
That is not to say the job is now Barkley’s. Corp came out of spring practice the clearcut starter, making good decisions, very few mistakes and taking over the leadership role. The challenge for Corp now is to rehabilitate his injured bone and get back to his old form in time to compete with Barkley, who now seems to have the leg up.
Corp admitted he was scared when he went down and got up “real slow, real wide-eyed.” But more than anything he was relieved, calling it the best case scenario.
“I’m excited that it’s not anything that’s season ending or even months or anything like that,” Corp said. “So [I’ll] just rehab and get back out there as soon as I can.”
As much as Barkley has impressed Carroll, the head coach who bleeds competition is expecting the battle to intensify that much more when Corp recovers. Carroll expects Corp to stay involved through film sessions and only have to recover the intangibles, such as timing and confidence.
Carroll compared Corp’s injury to last season, when Mark Sanchez went down with a knee injury (also on the third day of fall camp), but with one key difference: the separation between Corp and Barkley is not nearly as wide as it was between Sanchez and the quarterbacks he was competing with.
“I felt more that way that [Sanchez] was securely and clearly the number one guy,” Carroll said. “I think this competition is obvious. We’ve seen it everyday, and Aaron knows that and Matt knows that.”
Corp’s injury also revitalized often-forgotten redshirt junior Mitch Mustain, making him once again relative in the quarterback discussion. After getting beat out by Barkley for the No. 2 spot on the depth chart in the spring, Mustain had a rough summer, missing some workouts because of academic issues.
Mustain cleared up his issues in the classroom and is now excited to have a little more exposure to coaches in his last-ditch effort to earn the starting job.
“While [Corp’s] out I’ll take advantage of that,” Mustain said. “Obviously I’m up one more spot. It gives me a chance to go a little more head-to-head than otherwise, but I’m not making too much of it.”
Mustain had a good showing in USC’s first fall scrimmage, going 14-of-16 for 154 yards and making one touchdown.
Which quarterback eventually leads the offense will depend on how fast Corp recovers and how much Barkley can overcome his inexperience. Yet Carroll has made it clear that he has no reservations about starting the true freshman.
“[Barkley’s] off the charts,” he said. “With [Matt] Leinart, [Matt] Cassel, [John David] Booty and Sanchez, this is not the same process. We’re nowhere near what we’ve been before.”
And when asked if he would feel comfortable starting in front of 100,000-plus people in Columbus, Ohio, when the Trojans face the Buckeyes on Sept. 12, Barkley did not hesitate.
“Absolutely,” he said.

He’s back · Senior safety Taylor Mays returns to lead the Trojans on another championship run and maybe even make his case for the Heisman. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
It would be fair to say that when USC coach Pete Carroll entered stage right at Pac-10 Media Day last month, he was in the spotlight.
Journalists packed the lobby at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel. Photographers pulled out their big lenses. Even new Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott’s ears seemed to perk up a bit from his post on the side of the platform.
But it would also be fair to say that Carroll was sharing the glare with his partner on the stage, senior safety Taylor Mays.
Entering his fourth year at USC, Mays has never been one to shy away from the bright lights, and this season shouldn’t be any different. The 6-foot-3, 230-pound son of an ex-NFL player chose to return to USC for his senior year despite nearly unanimous projections that placed him in the first round of the draft. He says he wants to be the leader of the 2009 Trojans. Carroll said he can do just that.
“He is a guy in our program that is the epitome of maximizing his experience at USC,” said Carroll, who reportedly played a large role in convincing Mays to return. “He had a chance to go out last year but he wanted to graduate. He wanted to see what it was like to be a senior and have a chance to be a leader of this team.”
The Trojans will certainly need a leader this season, especially on defense.
Mays will team up with sixth-year senior Josh Pinkard to form a formidable force in the secondary, but apart from that, the defense that trounced Penn State in the Rose Bowl last January bears little resemblance to the team likely to suit up for the 2009 opener Sept. 5 against San Jose State.
Gone are eight defensive starters, including longtime linebacker position anchors Brian Cushing and Rey Maualuga.
In their place is a revamped linebacker unit, anchored by redshirt sophomore Chris Galippo in the middle, junior Malcolm Smith on the weakside and redshirt junior Michael Morgan on the strongside.
The only sure thing on the defensive line is junior Everson Griffen at one defensive end spot. Junior Christian Tupou will have to fight off sophomore Jurrell Casey at nose tackle. The other spots will be filled by a number of players, including sophomore Armond Armstead and redshirt senior Averell Spicer.
“We know what we can do,” Mays said. “What we really have to do right now is find where our work ethic is and find out what it takes to get to the point where the younger guys understand.”
Mays said he would do whatever it takes to set a good example for the underclassmen. The 21-year-old even went as far as saying that he would sit in front of a wall all night instead of attending a party if that’s what it took for his team to win.
“I’m trying to show them sacrifice and do everything right, because they’re looking to me now,” Mays said. “I’m willing to do it because I want to win.”
On offense, all five starting linemen will be back, including junior center Kristofer O’Dowd and sixth-year senior left guard Jeff Byers — both first-team preseason All-Americans. Redshirt junior Damian Williams and junior Ronald Johnson return at the receiver spots, but former quarterback Mark Sanchez — the No. 5 overall pick to the New York Jets — and split end Patrick Turner have moved on.
Some of USC’s coaches from last season have also moved on, namely offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian who is now the head coach at Washington. Replacing Sarkisian at the coordinator spot is receiver coach John Morton. Carroll also hired Jeremy Bates away from the Denver Broncos to coach quarterbacks.
“This offense was a little new as far as terminology,” Bates said. “But it’s like dating somebody for seven years and her name’s Laurie and dating someone else and her name’s Kim ­— you got to get used to calling her Kim.”
Bates is one of three new coaches on the USC staff, along with special teams coordinator Brian Schneider and defensive line coach Jethro Franklin, although Franklin had a previous stint at USC in 2005.
Carroll and his staff named redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp the first-string quarterback heading into the spring game in April, but freshman Matt Barkley has been hot on his tail in fall camp.
Corp suffered a cracked upper fibula on the third day of camp, sidelining him one to two weeks and leaving the door wide open for Barkley to make his case to be starter. USC has never started a true freshman at signal-caller under Carroll, but Carroll has repeatedly said that Barkley is unlike any freshman quarterback he’s had in his system.
Sixteen incoming freshmen and transfers on scholarship are practicing with the team in fall camp. A number of them will likely redshirt, but junior transfers from Mt. San Antonio College Jacob Harfman, a kicker/punter, and defensive tackle Hebron Fangupo could see meaningful time in the fall.
The SEC should be the nation’s power conference for the foreseeable future, but there are those who see the Pac-10 as a credible competitor. USA Today’s preseason poll puts four Pac-10 teams in its Top 25, compared to six for the SEC.
“What’s so obvious to me is that is our conference is so challenging for us, year in and year out,” Carroll said. “Without question, our most difficult games come right from our conference opponents.”
USC will play three nonconference games this season: at Ohio State and Notre Dame and at home against San Jose State. Last September, the Trojans trounced the then No. 5-ranked Buckeyes 35-3, only to fall to Pac-10 afterthought Oregon State in their next game.
USC’s penchant for losing one or two conference games a season, particularly to lower-ranked teams, is well publicized. The Trojans haven’t lost a nonconference regular season game since September of 2002. Last year, it was the Thursday night clunker to the Beavers in Corvallis, Ore. In 2007 it was an October home game against Stanford.
This year?
Well, the Trojans face No. 12 Cal in Berkeley in early October and will travel to No. 14 Oregon on Halloween.
Many blame the puzzling losses on a so-called lack of focus midseason for Pete Carroll’s Trojans.
“That’s the number one issue for us,” Carroll said back in July. “Can we practice great, day in and day out? Can we make these guys compete and find their best day after day so that we can perform to our potential?”

Before the new millennium hit, I wondered how people would refer to the first decade of the next century.
People could easily call on “the ‘80s” or “the ‘90s” to sum up an entire decade of culture and history in a few short words. Just hearing the words “the ‘60s” immediately makes me think of hippies, free love and a lot of pot being smoked.
So the first decade of the year 2000 presented an obvious problem. You can give a numeric name to just about every other decade but the first one. So with this nameless decade nearing its close, it’s necessary to find a description that both captures and exemplifies the unique history of the last 10 years.
Call it “Pete’s Decade.” As in Pete Carroll’s.
While it may take some time for this expression to enter our everyday lingo — Florida fans are probably already flooding the comment board in protest — it is difficult to come up with a more applicable name if your scope is college football and your measuring stick dominance.
Throughout the better part of Pete’s Decade, the USC football coach rejuvenated a once-proud program from the dregs of its national perception. Gone are the 6-6 seasons, the extended losing streaks to UCLA and the crummy bowl games. Here to stay are the double-digit winning seasons, dominance over the Bruins and one Rose Bowl after another.
To look back on the last 10 years in college football is to reflect on a remarkable run of dominance, week in and week out. Carroll’s resumé reads more like a laundry list of accolades and accomplishments. From the seven 11-win seasons to the seven straight Pac-10 titles, the Trojans’ domination is simply unrivaled in the modern era.
Yes, Florida has won two out of the last three national titles and no one is taking that away from them. But since Carroll arrived at USC, the Trojans have won 88 games compared to the Gators’ 77. Plus, Florida gets the opportunity to play one more game a season if they make it to the SEC championship. To me, that settles the “Team of the Decade” debate.
While USC has not played in a national championship since 2005, no other school has consistently gotten as hot as USC has in the latter parts of the season.
If this is Pete’s Decade, November would be his holy month. Carroll has never lost a game in November, leading his team to a perfect 27-0 record.
Getting ready to do it all over again in his ninth year at USC, Carroll reflected back on the run he has been instrumental in orchestrating.
“It doesn’t really feel that much different, I pretty much feel the same as I’ve felt for a number of years,” he said. “As I’ve said it’s kind of like Groundhog’s day in a sense, but [USC is] a good place to be.”
The climb to the peak of college football glory was difficult, but staying there has been even harder. As the Bushes, the Leinarts and the Maualugas move on to the NFL and his staff is plucked away by needy programs around the country, Pete always seems to find a way of reloading without really misfiring.
Like this year, with an inexperienced starting quarterback (whether it be Matt Barkley or Aaron Corp), a new offensive and defensive coordinator and only three starters returning on defense, the Trojans will still likely be favored to win every one of their games.
The secret behind Carroll’s success is to never look beyond the day at hand, instilling his players to “maximize their potential” on every play. It is a tactic that is easy to preach but much harder to get players to buy into. Like the fruitless pursuit of perfection, it is also unending.
“We’re developing our mentality and our attitude and the personality we want to project as a staff to the players and to our football team,” Carroll said. “And that’s ongoing, that’s a work in progress.”
Someone who can offer some of the best insight into the transition from the lowly ‘90s to Pete’s Decade is defensive coordinator Rocky Seto. He was a USC linebacker from 1997-98 and came on as a graduate assistant in 2000. He is entering his ninth year as a full-time assistant, where he primarily handles the secondary.
Seto said the Trojans worked just as hard before Carroll but did not hone the same level of concentration.
“What coach [Carroll] has brought in is a level of focus to help everyone maintain their level of focus to perform as well as they can,” Seto said.
When asked if he felt the target kept growing on USC as it continued to succeed year after year, Seto answered perfectly in-tune with the Carroll philosophy.
“It’s not a target,” Seto said. “When you think about a target you allow others to enter the focus, when really the focus is about us. Really, we’re our own hardest critic.”
Carroll has made his mark by treating every season the same and every day like the one previous. He jogs onto the practice field with the same bounce in his step as when he trots through the LA Coliseum tunnel. So it’s no wonder he does not approach this season any differently than he did when he arrived in 2001.
“It doesn’t seem that much different. It seems very much the same,” he said. “Faces change and the issues that you address change, and of course, even the guys on the staff.”
But the common denominator has always been Carroll and his uncanny ability to get jacked up for the same challenges every season.
“Staying at a high level for a long time, to be in the middle of it all, it’s just been the time of my life,” Carroll said. “It’s been so great that I want to create the fun for everyone around us.”
Whether he can continue to spread the joy around Southern California this season or the next 10 seasons is anyone’s guess. One thing you can bank on is that Carroll is sincere in his excitement for the new season, and is never one to rest on his laurels.
Still, it should be said that his record of the past eight years speaks for itself. No coach’s claim to the decade is greater than his, marking the last 10 years as his alone in the history of college football.

East Coast natives, especially those hailing from the Tri-State area, come to Los Angeles with a heavy bias, one made heavier by Woody Allen’s infamous grudge with the City of Angels — it was Allen, after all, who quipped, “I don’t want to move to a city where the only cultural advantage is being able to make a right turn on a red light.”
It’s hard to blame Allen: With its concrete overpasses, dwarfed architecture and distant neighborhoods that are seemingly impossible to get to by anything but one’s own car, Los Angeles comes across as a city even colder, more closed-off than Manhattan residents.
The car culture in California is undeniable. But with the price of parking and gasoline almost as high as Manhattan’s skyline, and the prospect of being “green” no longer a radical political statement but an entirely possible lifestyle, a return to LA’s public transportation system, however schizophrenically constructed and utterly ineffective it might appear in the eyes of serial L-train riders, is long overdue. As USC has transcended its commuter-school reputation in the past decade to solidify itself as a member of the community, so can Los Angeles redefine itself as a city of cultural immersion rather than segregation.
It all starts with LA residents.

How to travel by bus…
200 — Echo Park via Hoover and Alvarado
Departing across from the University Village Starbucks, the 200 takes you to Los Angeles’ most colorful neighborhood. Independent bookstores, cozy cafes and obscure concert venues are all within walking distance of the Sunset and Alvarado stop.
201 — Silver Lake
Similar to the 200, the 201 takes you to Echo Park’s cleaner, self-consciously hipster counterpart. The Sunset and Parkman stop is just several blocks east of Sunset Junction, the dine-and-shop mecca for Silver Lake residents.
 
Metro Rapid 720
Follow this rapid line down Wilshire Boulevard and watch the scenery change from neon-lit Korean strip malls to art-deco architecture of the Miracle Mile district to upscale high rises and designer stores of, alas, Bruin territory.
Metro Rapid 754 —
Hollywood via Vermont
The 754 is a necessity for LA residents living within walking distance of Vermont Avenue. Running until Sunset Boulevard, the 754 is the gateway bus that can take you to numerous other lines, including the 004, which travels westward on Sunset Boulevard, and the Red Line rail.
Metro Local and Express 460 — Disneyland
Though it requires waking up at ungodly hours on a Saturday, catching the 460 at Flower Street brings you to the front entrance of the happiest place on Earth — a fun day trip for those with some spare time between papers.

…or by rail
Red Line
Beginning at Downtown’s historic Union Station — Los Angeles’ next best thing to Penn Station — the Red Line pummels through the heart of Hollywood via Vermont Avenue. Before catching a matinee at the Pantages Theater at Hollywood and Vine or trying Steven Speilberg’s feet on for size in front of Grauman’s Chinese Theater at Hollywood and Highland, hop off at Vermont and Santa Monica and enjoy some of the best (and cheapest) Mexican food in town at El Gran Burrito. If Mexican cuisine doesn’t satisfy your taste buds, the Red Line ends just over the hill at Universal City Walk, a LA hotspot that hosts kitsch-y restaurants and bars such as Bucca Di Beppo, Hard Rock Cafe and Saddle Ranch.
Purple Line
One of only two subways, or heavy rail lines, of the Los Angeles County Metro (the other being the aforementioned Red Line), the Purple Line offers a limited variety of stops, serving primarily Downtown Los Angeles and Koreatown. Departing from Union Station, the Purple Line hits historical landmarks Pershing Square and MacArthur Park before careening into Koreatown. The line comes to a quick end at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue, across from The Wiltern Theater — for those who want to catch the latest indie rock act in town.
The Gold Line
Leaving from Union Station, the Gold Line’s very first stop on its light rail route is Chinatown. Once out of the station, walk west on College Street to Broadway, Chinatown’s main drag, where you’ll find the historic gateway adorned with dragons on your left and several markets, including the Bamboo Plaza, on your right. Head further north on the rail and visit the Southwest Museum, the Old LA Farmers Market adjacent to the Highland Park station, or the shops at Old Town Pasadena via the Del Mar station. Also, look out this month for the opening of the Gold Line’s east extension, which will include a stop in Little Tokyo.
The Blue Line
The appropriately named Blue Line takes you from the gray skies of Downtown to the clear blue waters of the Pacific — downtown Long Beach, where you will not only find a surf-side community, but also a thriving arts hub. The 1st Street stop — the line’s end — leaves you surrounded by art galleries and independent stores. The only downside to this picturesque ending is its middle section through LA county’s notoriously rough spots, Watts and Compton. For those brave at heart, take a detour at the 103rd Street station to pay tribute to the iconic Watts Towers, located several blocks away at 107th Street.

High note · The Wiltern Theatre received its unique name from its location: the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue. Built in 1931, The Wiltern is a fine example of LA’s art-deco architecture. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Although Austin holds the title of “The Live Music Capital of the World,” Los Angeles has a vibrant music scene and a slew of interesting venues that showcase local and touring acts of all musical styles.
Being in a big city for the first time gives you an opportunity to broaden your musical horizons and here, it’s easy to go beyond mainstream music and experience all of the concert hotspots Los Angeles has to offer. From Downtown to Hollywood, Echo Park to Los Feliz, every eclectic neighborhood in this musically diverse city is pulsating with a vibe and venue all its own.
The Smell
Located in a trash-soaked alley Downtown, The Smell is the closest underground music venue to USC. Known for being one of the few
alcohol-free all ages venues in town, The Smell has been home to several bands that have broken into the national scene. The venue is volunteer-run and all of its events are just $5, which is totally worth a bizarre passage into the world of independent art and music in Los Angeles.
247 S. Main St., Los Angeles
Echo/Echoplex
Slightly more mainstream than The Smell — and a little further from the alleys of downtown — is the Echo and the Echoplex. These two venues, which are actually
located upstairs/downstairs from each other in the same building, attract bigger artists touring from independent scenes from around the globe. A show at these venues, located on Sunset Boulevard in the epicenter of Echo Park’s renaissance, can run you up to $25, but the Echo’s monthly residencies — where a different band takes over headlining Monday nights each month — is thankfully free.
1822 W. Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles
Club Nokia
Away from the underground scene but closest to campus is Club Nokia, the more intimate counterpart of the Nokia Theatre located in the heart of LA Live. Club Nokia offers great music and entertainment for many tastes and the upcoming calendar includes larger acts like Placebo, The Streets, HelloGoodbye and Motorhead. The Nokia Club is definitely a great option for music lovers at USC mainly because of its proximity, accessibility and glamorous vibe.
800 West Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles
Sound proof · (below) Downtown’s new age landmark, The Smell, has played a major role in LA’s avant garde music scene. Among its alumni are No Age, Abe Vigoda and Mika Miko. (above) Located on Hollywood Boulevard just several blocks from the city’s populated tourist attractions, the Music Box at the Henry Fonda Theater  is hosting several big acts this fall, including Cake and Bat for Lashes. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Music Box at the Henry Fonda
Another small venue providing intimate shows for LA’s audiophiles is the Music Box at The Henry Fonda Theater. Located on Hollywood Boulevard at the eastern end of the starry sidewalk, this theater-turned-venue offers great artists and a state-of-the-art facility. Most events here are promoted by Live Nation and Goldenvoice, so you might have to shell out some hard-earned cash, but the balcony provides stadium-style seating and the rooftop smoking area projects a live feed from the show on the wall so you’ll never miss a moment.
6126 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood
 
Greek Theater
Great shows also come through the Greek Theater, Los Angeles’ most environmentally friendly venue located in the middle of the forest in Griffith Park. If you are willing to escape the bustle of the city, the Greek Theatre offers a memorable musical experience. Much like the Hollywood Bowl, the Greek’s natural surroundings add to the acoustics and make it a great place for a night of music under the stars.
2700 N Vermont Ave., Los Angeles
Wiltern Theatre
The Wiltern Theatre is another great venue that is easily accessible from USC. Located on the corner of Wilshire and Western across the street from the last Purple Line station, The Wiltern is a registered historical landmark and boasts a 2300 standing room capacity. Shows here range from nationally-known comedians to radio station-sponsored lineups and its steep sloped balcony and art deco amenities make for epic performances.
3790 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles

These are just some of the venues that the musical mecca of Los Angeles has to offer (more recognizable options include the Key Club, the Roxy, the Palladium and the House of Blues), but chances are that if you are willing to take the next step in discovering new mind-blowing musical acts, the aforementioned venues will rarely let you down.

Pixie dust · The Pixies is touring the nation this fall for the 20th anniversary of the release of its highly acclaimed album, Doolittle. - Photo Courtesy of Renaud Monfourney 
When musicians plan out  North American tours, the performers — both megastar bands and underground stars — never dare to miss a stop or two in the City of Angels, a lucky decision for audiophiles living in Los Angeles.
In the last year, Angelenos were treated to a slew of high-profile shows ranging from Paul McCartney’s sole California stopover on his supposed final tour to a “secret” performance by The Cure at West Hollywood’s 500-person capacity Troubadour. This fall proves no different.
At first glance Los Angeles’ fall tour schedule looks closer to a rejected Lollapalooza lineup than a contemporary concert calendar, with a handful of seminal alternative rock groups from the ’80s and ’90s blazing through town. But with appearances from some of the music industry’s most mainstream artists to the thriving local scene, this coming fall’s concert lineup is a colorful menagerie that covers all the right musical bases.
To point you in the right direction and help you get your money’s worth, here are some of the most anticipated — and in a few cases, rarest — performances slated to hit Los Angeles this fall.
Nine Inch Nails  (SOLD OUT)
Sept. 2 at Hollywood Palladium Sept. 3 at The Music Box at the Henry Fonda Theater
Sept. 5 at Wiltern Theatre
Sept. 6 at Echoplex
For what frontman Trent Reznor touts as his influential industrial outlet’s farewell tour, Nine Inch Nails will make the rounds at some of Los Angeles’ most popular venues for their final shows.
From the recently remodeled large-capacity Palladium to the enticingly intimate Echoplex, hardcore NIN fans will find plenty of opportunities to bid their beloved band adieu — that is, of course, these concertgoers were lucky enough to have already purchased tickets during the tour’s fan-only sale.
Ticketless? Be prepared to shell out some major cash. However, considering Reznor’s recent wishy-washiness with his Twitter account, do not expect NIN’s LA performances to be their very last.
FYF Fest (Formerly F Yeah Fest)
Sept. 5 at Los Angeles State Historic Park; $20
Beginning as an ambitious project helmed by a Los Angeles teenager in 2004, the recently rechristened FYF Fest saw phenomenal growth over the last several years as it developed from an Echo Park secret to a nationally recognized festival.
Now in its sixth incarnation, FYF Fest not only delivers its most star-studded roster to date, but also seeks to bring awareness to the rampant budget cuts slated to affect California state parks.
The eclectic lineup promises something for everyone, be they rave-happy electro-kids (Telepathe, Glass Candy, Peanut Butter Wolf), die-hard punk rockers (The Black Lips, Fucked Up, Converge) or Pitchfork aficionados (No Age, Mika Miko, Wavves.)
If you can’t afford a ticket the festival organizers have teamed up with local charities to give those who volunteer 12 hours or more of their time a pair of free tickets.
Sonic Youth
Sept. 29 at Wiltern Theatre; $28.50
OK, so “youth” seems a tad paradoxical now that all members of Sonic Youth are nearly  half a century old. However, if the band’s 16th and latest studio album, The Eternal, proves anything about the groundbreaking experimental post-punk/noise group, it’s that nothing — not even middle age — will slow it down.
Sonic Youth’s classic lineup of husband/wife duo Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, guitarist Lee Ranaldo and drummer Steve Shelley is joined on this tour by former Pavement bassist Mark Ibold — a longtime collaborator and friend of the band.
While Sonic Youth notoriously fills its sets with current songs rather than bits from its more acclaimed albums, hesitant fans should look toward the group’s summer tour setlists, which boast deep cuts such as “Death Valley ’69” and “Tom Violence” mixed in throughout evenings of newer material.
Bob Dylan
Oct. 13-15 at Hollywood Palladium; $56.50
Bob Dylan does not play guitar anymore — or so say attendees of Dylan’s recent performances. Rather surprisingly, such claims are based in truth. Instead of strumming away at his six-string, the American music master seats himself behind a piano with his back turned toward the audience as he reworks his classic songs into unrecognizable mutilations of their former selves.
But he’s still Bob Dylan — hopelessly iconic to the point of being a clichéd symbol of the reactionary 1960s. Movies have been made about him and people have built careers by imitating him — heck, your roommate probably has a poster of Dylan hanging on his wall. Seeing this legendary songwriter in concert is something you will tell your grandchildren about.
The Pixies
Nov. 4 at Hollywood Palladium; Price TBA
Rumormongers, rejoice. After years of speculation from fans, the Pixies finally return to the United States for the first time since 2005, kicking off their tour this November at the Palladium.
In conjunction with the 20th anniversary of its most celebrated release, Doolittle, the band plans to play the album in its entirety while on its selective jaunt through Europe and the States.
While the retrospective performance might irk diehard fans hoping lead singer Frank Black would deliver on his promise of new material from the seminal alternative band, all ill feelings should subside once the band powers through the album that features some of its most celebrated and recognizable songs, including “Wave of Mutilation” and “Here Comes Your Man.”
Dinosaur Jr.
Nov. 5 at House of Blues Sunset Strip; $28
Barely able to buy a pack of beers when they scored an unlikely hit with 1987’s “You’re Living All Over Me,” Dinosaur Jr. maintained a heavy presence in the burgeoning alternative scene before the group disbanded in 1997.
More than 10 years later, the original members have reunited, recording two albums and touring the world extensively. Their latest effort, Farm, released this past June, places Dinosaur Jr. back at a creative high point unseen since their celebrated 1987 release.
Unlike former tour mates Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. fills its performances with some of the group’s biggest hits, from “Freak Scene” to “Sludgefeast,” ensuring that longtime supporters of the Amherst, Mass. trio will not be disappointed by the show.

The Grove and the ArcLight Hollywood are the Los Angeles theaters most associated with the modern moviegoing experience. Of course, stadium seating and state-of-the-art digital picture and sound aren’t complete without exorbitant ticket prices and a dearth of choices besides the latest Hollywood fare (The Landmark and the ArcLight Hollywood are, generally, exceptions in variety but not price).
Scattered around this great city, hidden far away from the hustle of the average multiplex, are single-screen treasures that host a variety of revival series, indie gems and foreign films. They are mostly old, sometimes a little run down and, best of all, never digital — giving audiences the increasingly rare chance to hear the soothing heartbeat of a real film projector. Some are independently owned and some aren’t, but they all strive toward the same end — maintaining the credibility of the city whose name is most synonymous with cinema.
Screensaver · The Vista shows new releases in a cozy setting. The Aero Theatre screens American and foreign classics. - Leah Thompson and Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
The Aero Theatre
One of the two local theaters operated by the American Cinematheque, the Aero Theatre features classic film double features almost exclusively. This aging Westside theater deals mostly in film series, with Hitchcock or Wilder being popular repeat programs. Yet the programs are never limited to the American giants and vary wildly from month to month. During the winter, the American Cinematheque hosts numerous advance screenings of movies as Oscar-bait, usually featuring Q&A with directors. With the heartrending end of the film program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art looming this fall, the Aero and its sister theater, the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, will stand alone together as the best places to regularly see classic films on the big screen.
1328 Montana Ave., Santa Monica
The Downtown Independent
Until a recent change in ownership, this beautifully designed little movie house near Downtown was the awkwardly named ImaginAsian Center. Unfortunately, the Downtown Independent is located just close enough to the rougher parts of the city to scare off weak-stomached potential patrons — its next door neighbor is one of the rowdiest bars around. The programming is inconsistent, made up mostly of screening series or single showings of very independent movies. For example, last year they celebrated the work of schlock auteur Uwe Boll (featuring a special appearance by the man himself) and this year hosted several films from the Japanese International Film Festival. Their films are eclectic enough to warrant a bookmark on the Downtown Independent calendar for occasional browsing. Possibly the best part about this theater is its proximity to Little Tokyo — Japanese cuisine is a must after an evening showing.
251 S. Main Street, Los Angeles

The Nuart Theatre
After the tragic closure of the Rialto in Pasadena, the Nuart Theatre stands as the last of the Landmark-owned single screens in Los Angeles. This older, somewhat artlessly designed yet undeniably charming theater lies on the outliers of Bruin country in Westwood, and boasts probably the best midnight movie programming in the city — often cult films and classic blockbusters share the marquee from week to week. The Rocky Horror Picture Show runs every Saturday at midnight, and the daytime programming skews toward films too indie or foreign to play at the nearby Landmark theater in the Westside Pavillion.
11272 Santa Monica Boulevard., Los Angeles
The Vista
The Vista offers one of the few urban moviegoing experiences that resembles a night out at one of the famous Hollywood movie palaces of yore. This ancient holdover from the golden years, located conveniently in the Scientology section of east Hollywood, boasts internal architecture that is either gorgeous or tacky – depending on personal preferences. They play mostly first-run Hollywood films, but the atmosphere — not the billing — is really the reason to visit the Vista. Beware: consistent with the old-school setting, the Vista does not accept credit cards.
4473 Sunset Drive, Hollywood

The Silent Movie Theatre
Bursting with Hollywood history both bright and shadowy, this amazing movie house recently underwent an expensive renovation on the behalf of its new owners, the Cinefamily. The new owners also imported a far more wide-reaching series of programs into the theater which, obviously, used to feature only silent films. That tradition remains on Silent Wednesdays, but the Silent Movie Theater is also home to music shows, speaker engagements and other programs truly too weird to explain. Like the Downtown Independent, you never know what gems (and duds) you’ll find buried on their calendar. Silent films are fun, too, for all you critical studies students.

During my recent trip to Paris, the famed fashion capital of world, I was fortunate enough to witness an unlikely American commodity holding its own in the unfamiliar land of high-end labels and couture shopping. As usual, on the first day of the summer sales, hundreds of Parisians piled into all the French retail favorites — renowned designers like Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Chanel —snapping up luxury goods and last-season markdowns. But as I walked past the dazed shoppers, I was shocked by what I saw.
The recognizable all-white storefront adorned by the simple, bold black letters stood out like an outsider. “Really?” I asked myself, “an American Apparel in Paris?” The idea baffled me.
Out of curiosity, I walked inside, only to find the setting
eerily similar to a typical store in Los Angeles. Cramped aisles and edgy campaign material, check. Blinding neon fabrics, shiny lamé and colorful basics, check. Hipster teens begging their parents to buy them expensive tri-blend -shirts and metallic headbands, check. It was evident by the crowded store — even without a single sale going on — that the American Apparel craze had caught on overseas.
But how could this happen? Here at home, for some, the concept of buying a 20-something dollar plain T-shirt seems
wildly ridiculous, not to mention irresponsible given the current economic climate. While the quality may be higher and the product softer, for most consumers American Apparel would have to explain its costs in areas someplace else.
Ironically, this subtle difference just might be the key to the brand’s success. With a small bump in prices, the company has become a rising industry leader by not only reviving an unpopular business model, but also tackling important issues that for the last decade have gained heightened attention.
The first of these issues is domestic production. Though the “Made in Downtown LA” tagline might be a trendy branding strategy to loyalist consumers, it is in reality a stand for America’s economic independence — a challenge the country has faced more grippingly in recent years.
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa praised the company for not falling into the trap of outsourcing labor for cheaper wages; production in China would cost a company, on average, a mere 40 cents a worker per hour versus the more than $12 American Apparel pays its manufacturing employees, not to mention the medical, dental, ESL training and even on-site yoga benefits it also offers its employees.
Believe it or not, American Apparel, a company barely two decades old, is now the largest clothing manufacturer in the United States today — a hefty title considering the fact that many Angelenos still find the brand to be no different than the overpriced fad retail chains it competes with.
But American Apparel’s roots as a wholesaler have helped it to develop its own place in the market (the company didn’t open its first retail store until 2003). The 800,000 sq. ft. American Apparel factory, located in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles, is the largest garment factory in the nation, producing 250,000 garments daily with the help of more than 5,000 workers from the community.
Clearly, the uptick in price is crucial to keeping industry at home with safe and beneficial conditions for workers. And while other countries may care less about American labor, cost also ensures a quality product that is justified on its own by its fashion value.
“They might be a little more expensive than other brands, but I buy their clothes mostly because they fit well and it’s what’s in style right now,” said Stephanie Vazquez, a junior majoring in public relations.
Today, however, the idea of American-produced clothing has moved past being just stylish. While the American Apparel’s “trend factor” is oftentimes overwhelming — the Intelligence Group called it the “No. 2 Trend-Setting Brand” behind Nike — it might be its very cult status is vital to the brand’s survival and continued success, both at home and abroad.
Made in LA · American Apparel’s vertical integration management model means that every article of clothing is designed, dyed, cut, sewed and distributed from the company’s 800,000 sq. ft. factory at 6th and Alameda streets in Downtown Los Angeles. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
that Realizing its target demographic — as the company puts it, “20 to 32-year-old young metropolitan adults” — American Apparel has succeed in marrying fashion with popular social themes. Its fight against immigration reform was more vocally heard through their  “Legalize LA” campaign,  which undoubtedly influenced the brand’s latest “Legalize Gay” campaign — a call to repeal Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California last fall.
“It isn’t only about getting up and getting dressed in the morning. People wear things to make a statement,” said Melissa Ramboyong, a college student who shops at the store regularly. “American Apparel clothing stands for messages I can identify with.”
The company finds young customers, more likely than not, sharing its same core values and as a result, they support the American Apparel brand. Over the past decade, the company has slowly moved from being pure novelty to a highly respected fashion and social emblem by its customers. This transformation takes place only in an age where heightened political interest amongst younger people is especially prominent.
“A lot of people at USC like that fact that American Apparel T-shirts are made sweatshop-free,”  Vazquez said. “I personally don’t really look into the issues American Apparel fights for but I do see why they can be important.”
As for one of the more popular issues, the environment, American Apparel is of course working to stay green. Aside from vertical integration — a model where everything from dyeing to packaging is completely self-run — the company takes part in a host of other environmentally friendly initiatives, such as recycling fabric scraps and utilizing organic cotton and dyes. There is no doubt that these eco-friendly initiatives have aided in American Apparel’s success as a brand.
“You can feel good about buying something for a cause,” Ramboyong said.
The cause is now going global. In Paris alone there are currently six American Apparel retail stores, joining more than 80 other oversea shops in 19 foreign countries. Even in its struggle to establish an international name, American Apparel is setting the trend and sticking to its principles.

Ice Ice Baby · Ice Cream Man Matt Allen stands guard over his truck, from which he delivers free treats. - Photo courtesy of the Ice Cream Man
The unmistakable jingle of the frozen treat-filled truck as it merrily made its way down the street used to have children scurrying to grab dollar bills and change, running outside to flag down the ice cream man before he got away.
Now, with the latest technology at their fingertips and their own freezers stocked with ice cream, the ice cream truck simply does not put the same excited twinkle in their eyes.  To remedy this dying American tradition, a new age of mobile desserts has taken hold in Los Angeles, one that revolves around two key ingredients: gourmet treats and Twitter.
Thanks to the advent of Twitter — a forum for updating the world on what you are doing at all times — the days of chasing down the ice cream man, frantically waving dollar bills, are a thing of the past.  A few clicks of the mouse will reveal the current location of your favorite mobile dessert truck, and, if you’re lucky, also what they are serving, how long they will be there and the secret to getting a special discount.
“All mobile food is dependent on Twitter or something like it to get the word out about their product,” said Natasha Case, co-founder of Cool Haus, a new Los Angeles-based mobile ice cream company.  “It’s a great way to build fan loyalty.”
Case and co-founder Freya Estreller made their Cool Haus
debut at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, selling made-to-order ice cream sandwiches with architectural themes from a revamped postal truck.  Using local, organic ingredients whenever possible, the ice cream sandwiches have names such as “Frank Behry” — strawberry ice cream between sugar cookies — and “Mintimalism” — mint chip between chocolate cookies — cleverly combining the company’s two most important inspirations.
Ice cream and architecture might seem like an odd combination, but for these women, both in their mid-20s with an equal love for food and design, their business’ combination of the two — which they like to call farchitecture — is a dream come true.
“There’s something very architectural in the way that the mobile food truck challenges the urban sprawl in LA,” Case said.  “You’re not limited to the bricks and mortar of a retail space.”
You’re also not limited to charging for your treats, as Matt Allen, also known as the Ice Cream Man, has made apparent in his five years spent traveling the country giving away free ice cream.
Choosing the name Ice Cream Man for his company simply because the term “makes people feel good,” Allen set out five years ago with the goal of giving away half a million free ice cream treats.  So far, more than 210,000 have been given away and he hopes to reach his goal by the end of next year.
“It’s going to be tough, but I love the challenge,” Allen said.  “We’re trying to build a business model based on giving away free ice cream.”
Although Ice Cream Man gives away pre-packaged treats similar to those sold from a traditional ice cream truck, there is nothing traditional about the way Allen conducts his people-pleasing business.  Based in Long Beach, Allen uses Twitter to alert ice cream lovers where in the country he’s going to be, usually stationing the Ice Cream Man truck, which he affectionately calls Bessie, at various music festivals and stores that sponsor his company.
“It’s a relatively inexpensive business to start and I think that the brick and mortar stores are just not as prevalent anymore,” Allen said.  “There’s no point in investing hundreds of thousands of dollars and locking yourself down in that one spot when you can invest a lot less and do something along the same lines with a mobile company.”
Although Sprinkles, the ever-popular cupcake store in Beverly Hills, began as a stationary retail spot, even they seem to have caught on to the growing trend of mobile sweets.  Getting its start in May of this year, the Sprinklesmobile travels around Los Angeles, selling the shop’s specialty cupcakes both on public streets and at private events.
“We get so many requests to open Sprinkles stores all over greater LA,” said Nicole Schwartz, a Sprinkles marketing assistant.  “The Sprinklesmobile is a great way to reach customers who drive all the way to Beverly Hills to visit our store.”
Like both Cool Haus and Ice Cream Man, the Sprinklesmobile has a Twitter account, usually giving its followers a couple hours notice about where it is headed, and then tweeting again once it has arrived at the location.
“Mobile food customers seem to be very tech-savvy and up to date with Los Angeles happenings,” Schwartz said.  “As more businesses have entered the market with a higher quality gourmet product, customers’ perception and expectation of mobile food has transformed with this trend.”
While taco trucks and other mobile food have been a staple in Los Angeles for years, the new gourmet dessert trucks seem to be bringing mobile food to consumers.
“In the last two years, it has become a mainstream thing,” Case explained.  “Food trucks are getting a yuppier, hipper, untraditional taco truck crowd.”
Though this crowd might have stopped chasing down the traditional ice cream trucks upon hearing the approach of the jolly jingle, they have taken up a new form of chasing their desserts by utilizing Twitter as a tracking device.  And when the modern mobile dessert vendors manage to put the same twinkle in their customers’ eyes that traditional ice cream trucks once did, they know that what they’re doing is truly worth it.
“You can make your dreams come true with a mobile restaurant,” Estreller said.
Your dreams and the dreams of thousands of ice cream-lovers who, with Twitter and the updated mobile dessert trucks, are able to relive their childhood ice cream truck chases in a more modern, grown-up way.

Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Since it was founded in 1880 with 53 students and 10 teachers, USC has expanded far beyond even the wildest dreams of its founders. In its seminal year, the university only managed to give diplomas to three people at the first graduation — how could they have known that someday, a USC alum would walk on the moon? Or that two other alumni would become rich writing stories about people that live in space? It would have blown their minds.
And in the last decade, USC has shown itself to be richer than ever in history, achievements, notable alumni and academic contributions. And also in money.
As the decade comes to an end, it’s time to look back at the last 10 years of USC and see not only how our university has changed, but how it has changed the world around us. And possibly how journalistic standards have changed. There is a lot of Wikipedia information here.
2001
After successfully surviving the disastrous Y2K bug and being named “College of the Year 2000” by Time Magazine for extensive community service programs, USC launched into the new millennium with a bang.
Having worked to be seen as a highly selective institution since 1997, when the university first admitted fewer than half of the applicants, USC was rewarded by the Newsweek/Kaplan guides by being named as one of America’s nine “hottest schools.” This epithet probably didn’t do much to dispel the image of USC as a school attended chiefly by Malibu Beach Barbie.
The Association of American Colleges and Universities also named USC as one of 16 “leadership institutions,” which was great for attracting motivated high school applicants with leadership skills, but which made for awkward involvement fairs with too many organization leaders and no followers.
2001 also marked the first year of the reign of Pete Carroll, whose legendary record as coach of the football team would catapult him to stardom. His celebrity status would make it easy for even the most athletically ignorant Trojans to mention his name and sound as though they paid attention to football.
2002
USC set a new record in higher education by raising $2.85 billion over the course of the nine-year “Building on Excellence” campaign. 2002 graduates hoped that this meant they would be solicited for money less often than usual, but ultimately found this to not be the case.
It is estimated that it was around this time that the Pertusati Bookstore truly understood the value of the USC brand name, and began emblazoning school symbols on even the most obscure pieces of merchandise, including bikinis, bras and women’s panties. The only reason the store has not come out with a line of USC brand condoms is because another company has already taken that idea.
2003
Nothing much interesting happened in 2003, but it was generally a better year than 1987, in which the only notable event was the opening of the Carl’s Jr. restaurant on campus. This gave USC the dubious designation of being the first institute of higher education to own and operate a fast food franchise.
2004
USC hosted 2004 democratic presidential candidates for a debate sponsored by CNN and the Los Angeles Times and moderated by Larry King. Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards, Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Dennis Kucinich debated broad issues such as civil rights, health care and which candidate would best be able to defeat incumbent President George W. Bush (as it turned out, not Kerry).
In a straw poll conducted in the days leading up to the debate, 50 percent of participating students voted for Kucinich, making it the most successful election of his career.
Although 500 tickets were set aside for students to watch the debate in Bovard Auditorium, students nonetheless complained that the distribution of the tickets was unfair and about 40 students staged a demonstration outside the auditorium in protest. The outrage, however, paled in comparison to that demonstrated by students three years later who felt they had been deprived of football seats.
That summer, USC sent 35 athletes to the 2004 Athens Olympics, who collectively won 17 medals, including eight golds. Speculation that USC could have sent even more athletes if the university started a varsity table tennis team is supported by the fact that USC students tend to excel at a variety of sports involving ping pong tables.
2005
More than 100,000 people participated in the university’s 125th anniversary. More than 75 anniversary events took place throughout the year, culminating in a three-day festival in October that was attended by the governor of New York, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and world-renowned violinist Itzhak Perlman. A 6-foot tall cake and a free picnic lunch were served to all participants, causing students accustomed to eating in campus dining halls to demand that USC birthday celebrations occur twice weekly.
2005 also marked the release of Star Wars: Episode Three — Revenge of the Sith. The last of the Star Wars prequels written, directed and produced by USC alum George Lucas was generally well received, and agreed to be not as bad as Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Lucas would make up for the stiff dialogue and clichéd romantic scenes in 2006 by giving USC $180 million. Fair enough.
2006
An economic impact analysis by an international consulting firm reported that USC is responsible for $4 billion annually in economic activity in Los Angeles County alone. About 30 percent of that economic activity comes from the purchase of heinously expensive textbooks that are read about 19 percent of the time. You’re welcome, Los Angeles!
In the December issue of PC Magazine ­— the “Top 20 Wired Colleges” issue — the periodical ranked USC as the eighth most connected, plugged-in and high-tech campus in the country, which is probably a result of the disproportionate number of Sidekicks owned by the various demi-celebrities enrolled on campus. Rumer Willis was among the freshman class in 2006, although she left after a semester to pursue acting in such prestigious films as The House Bunny.
USC also kicked off “Visions and Voices: The USC Arts and Humanities Initiative” in 2006, which was great for all students interested in arts and culture, although everyone who unwittingly signed up for the mailing list still receives a bewildering amount of e-mail.
2007
Infamous USC alumnus O.J. Simpson returned to national attention in 2007 when he took sports memorabilia from a hotel casino in Las Vegas at gunpoint. Several months later, he was sentenced to 33 years in prison. Although Simpson remains a regrettable stain on the reputation of USC alumni, the university is not alone in having taught undesirable graduates. Ted Kaczynski, a.k.a. the Unabomber, graduated from Harvard, assassin Aaron Burr graduated from Princeton and former president George W. Bush graduated from Yale.
2008
In 2008, after having completed three years of exuberantly choreographed and dynamically scored high school musicals, Zac Efron was accepted to USC. Much to the dismay of girls all over campus, Efron deferred his admission, presumably to pursue a more mellifluous path.
The number of sketchy places to buy food around USC decreased when the USC Commons was demolished to make room for the newer, more awesome Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Chano’s, Viztango and EVK remained easily accessible to students, though, as a testament to the eternal availability of mediocre and slightly questionable cuisine around the University Park Campus.
2009
The Chronicle of Higher Education recognized USC in its list of “Great Colleges to Work For in 2009,” although in the current economy, it’s a privilege to be working pretty much anywhere.
The Princeton Review ranked USC No. 9 among the country’s “dream colleges” as part of its 2009 “College Hopes and Worries” survey. We can accept this as confirmation that USC is awesome in every conceivable way to the minds of prospective students. It probably only becomes a “reality college” when the students get here, and realize that in addition to all the fountain running and tailgating and frisbee throwing, there is also homework. Lots and lots of homework. Still, it’s way better than being at the “nightmare college” across town.
2010 and beyond
What’s next for ’SC? A new line of luxury kitchen appliances in cardinal and gold available at the bookstore? A celebrity student that will actually stay for more than two semesters? Another free cake? (Please?)
Well, if nothing else, perhaps USC can become the first institute of higher education to operate two fast food franchises: Keep your fingers crossed for In-N-Out.

Stability · Alumna Marcy Pullard stands in front of Avenues of Independence, Inc., a non-profit transitional home she founded in 2008 to provide temporary shelter and support for homeless teenagers. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
USC alumna Marcy Pullard is living her dream, by helping other people try to live theirs.
Pullard, who graduated in 1995, is the founder of Avenues of Independence, Inc., a transitional home for homeless youth located just more than two miles from USC.
Pullard had dreamt of opening a transitional home for many years, and it was this dream that brought her to the USC School of Social Work. After graduating, she worked several different jobs in the area around USC until, in May 2008, she finally secured enough money to open her non-profit transitional home.
“This is my passion. This is what I’ve always done,” she said. “It’s been in the making for about 10 years.”
Avenues of Independence gives homeless youth ages 18 to 25 a place to find shelter and support as they work to move on to the next step in their lives. The home provides weekly clinics to help ease the transition.
“For me, the bottom line is, at 18 most teenagers aren’t ready to go out on their own,” Pullard said.
Pullard helps clients with everything from obtaining a California ID to writing their resumé and finding jobs.
For Andrew, a client of Avenues of Independence who asked that his real name not be printed, the goal is to find a job.
“I have my resumé and everything, but the economy was down so jobs were few and far between,” he said.
After only three days at the center, the 22-year-old had already set up a job interview in Hollywood, but he still had one problem — finding shoes.
“I have dress pants, dress shirts, socks but no shoes,” Andrew said.
This is a problem Pullard sees often. Many of her clients lack the basic items or skills to obtain jobs. Her goal is to help them find these resources so they are able to build a stable foundation.
Andrew found the center after his family kicked him out and he needed a place to live. Though he’s been with Pullard for a short time, he has already found her program helpful.
“I like this more than being in a shelter with bunk beds,” he said. “I find it more productive for me. I wish there were more programs like this.”
The transitional home currently accommodates four clients at a time and each client typically stays one month. Pullard hopes to expand eventually, but she does not yet have the funds.
“Although I wrote the program to be long term, right now one of our major funding sources allowed us to do emergency shelter, which is a short-term thing,” Pullard explained. “We’re looking to find additional funding to do more long-term.”
As she gives back to the community around her, Pullard is also giving back to her alma mater. She uses the university’s resources to help her program grow, and works with the School of Social Work to place a first-year student as her intern.
Pullard also takes on students from other universities as interns, and last year she worked with Rory Manley, an undergraduate from California State University, Los Angeles.
Manley found the experience valuable in helping him better understand the field of social work and credits Pullard with giving him indispensable advice about applying to graduate programs.
“Having worked with Marcy has been a personal and academic blessing for me,” Manley said. “She’s always very hands on.”
Ultimately, Pullard hopes to see Avenues of Independence grow into a long-term, multi-bed facility, and she is currently raising money to buy a motel not far from her current facility. Until then, she will continue to take pride in her clients’ small achievements each day.
“For each step they accomplish, it’s good,” she said.

As the fall semester draws near, the Undergraduate Student Government’s new administration is already hard at work, preparing to push an ambitious list of campus improvements including tighter security and better access to campus health services.
A top priority for USG President Holden Slusher’s administration will be making Leavey Library safer for students studying late at night. Specifically, USG officials said, Slusher’s staff wants the university to install turnstiles at the library’s front entrance.
The turnstiles would keep track of the number of students and visitors in the library and reduce the risk of theft, USG said.
“We want to really push aspects of both safety and transportation this semester, especially safety … as it’s become a huge concern over the past two to three years,” said USG Vice President Ashlie Chan.
Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC Libraries, said he and his team have begun talking with USG about the viability of installing turnstiles, but McHarg said his department had yet to begin research on cost efficiency.
Chan also said USG plans to work with the Department of Public Safety this semester to decide where DPS officers should be stationed around campus, and to discuss the possibility of installing additional security cameras where needed.
In addition to its efforts to bulk up campus security, USG is lobbying to extend the weekend operating hours of the University Park Health Center. Currently, the health center is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekends and for urgent care only.
Longer operating hours for the health center and the Lyon Center, the main campus workout facility, were a prominent aspect of Slusher’s campaign platform last spring. But Helen Moser, USG’s director of campus affairs, said both initiatives might be wishful thinking this semester because of the still-struggling economy and the university-wide staff hiring freeze, which went into effect last November.
“It’s not very feasible at the moment because of the budget issues,” Moser said in reference to extending weekend health center hours. “We need to work on making sure that we keep the [health center] hours that we do have.”
Slusher said he is optimistic about longer Lyon Center hours after talks with Patrick Bailey, executive director of Student Life and Involvement, but Bailey did not indicate that the improvement is imminent.
“We have a lot of major challenges, and with every problem, there is always a money factor. With the economy and the university’s policies … it’s harder, but I don’t think that’s ever going to be a reason not to see results,” Slusher said.
To find these results early on — despite a stall in its big plans by a sputtering economy — USG says it will turn to some of its more thrifty agenda items, such as a safety blog where students can voice concerns to DPS.
“We do have very lofty goals, and the administration might say no [to certain projects] due to economic cuts. But if we’re going to start with big changes and work our way down, it’s something we can pass down to the next administration,” Chan said.

Leasing · Construction on the University Gateway Complex nears completion. Students will soon be able to lease apartments for next year. | Photo by Ian-Elston
A pummeling economy has done little to slow progress on two of USC’s most important capital construction projects and both are on schedule to open next fall.
The University Gateway apartments, which will also serve as a restaurant and retail complex on the northwest corner of Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard, has made “significant progress,” said Matt Burton, a principal at Urban Partners LLC, the company developing the building.
Starting Sept. 5, students can lease apartments for the 2010-2011 school year at the Gateway Welcome Center in the University Village.
“Knock on wood, everything has gone smoothly,” Burton said. “There is no question as to when we will open.”
Retail and restaurant leases are currently under negotiation as well. Construction crews are now working floor by floor for the next six to nine months to finish all the interiors of the apartment units, which could eventually house as many as 1,600 students.
The highly anticipated Ronald Tutor Campus Center — under construction, along with Gateway, since 2008 — has also made progress over the summer. Once open, it should help alleviate campus student congestion, those involved say.
“The biggest thing we’ve accomplished is getting brick, stone and glass on the exterior of the building,” said Stan Westfall, a USC project manager. “We’ve been fortunate on the project that we haven’t had any huge delays.”
Administrators hope the progress will mean less disruption during the school year for students.
“We try to do things, such as utility work, that are more disruptive during the summer when there less students are around,” said Curtis Williams, vice president of campus development and facilities management services.
Construction began in summer 2008 to replace Commons, which held restaurants as well as mail and USCard services, with a more dynamic student center that would help boost USC’s profile.
“[Commons] wasn’t fitting for the top, elite university that USC is,” said Jason Cruz, the Campus Center project coordinator. “It wasn’t adequate for the students.”
The new center will include study areas, an outdoor plaza and dining options. The building will also be home to several offices, including Undergraduate Admissions, Undergraduate Student Government, and Student Life and Involvement and KSCR radio station.
“It’s going to be the new hub of the campus,” Cruz said.
Administrators are still deciding which organizations will be housed in the campus center, and when the center will be open to students.
Administrators also hope the campus center will be a model for new, greener buildings on campus. The building is USC’s first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified building.
Recently, the center won a Green Building of America Award. Given by an organization called Real Estate & Construction Review, the honor recognizes the center’s environmentally friendly design and construction. The building uses more energy-efficient materials and did not use materials containing harmful chemicals.

Disappear here · The novel combines ‘06 alumna Caroline Weiss’ West Coast writings with those of her East Coast writing partner. - Photo courtesy of Caroline Weiss 
Everybody in Stalking Bret Easton Ellis is an emotional, heaping mess.
Taylor’s mom is in rehab in Laurel Canyon again. Foster is a frat boy from a poor family. Lanie has an eating disorder. Sarah wants a boob job. Chelsea steals weed from her dad. And Nico (formerly Nicole) is ditching class to fly out to L.A. for a coke-and-alcohol-fueled rendezvous with her sometimes boyfriend — a rich, party-obsessed, married 40-year-old.
Everybody listens to Radiohead, Coldplay and Elliott Smith. And everybody is “über-hip.”
With Stalking Bret Easton Ellis — a novel composed of vignettes detailing each  character’s  inner monologue — USC alumnus Caroline Weiss and her cross-country writing partner, Margaret Wallace, chase readers with a verbal chainsaw through the swirling, superficial lives of highly privileged college kids.
“I would say 40 to 50 percent is based on experiences that we actually went through and conversations that were had,” Weiss said. “We included a lot of details.”
Weiss was born in San Diego to a family as privileged as her characters’ — both her parents were Princeton graduates. Weiss’ propensity for writing began as soon as she could hold a pencil and before hitting her teens, she had already made hand-stapled books, published short stories and penned a feature-length screenplay. Though she and her familly moved constantly has a child, Weiss eventually ended up in Houston long enough to attend a private high school (where she met co-writer Wallace). And after a stint at St. Andrews in Scotland, Weiss transferred into USC’s political science program.
“Because of my travels, I have a strong interest in politics and international relations,” Weiss said. “I’ve never taken a writing class or been critiqued.”
Somewhere between Houston and Los Angeles, Weiss read Rules of Attraction by Brett Eason Ellis and immediately gravitated towards the “cool indifference” and detail-filled echoes that fill Ellis’ black hole characters. She devoured the rest of the famous author’s repertoire — which includes Less Than Zero and American Psycho, among others — and used his raw, introspective writing style as her muse for future prose.
“I’ve had depression my whole life, and [reading Brett Easton Ellis] lifted a burden about being in this dark place,” Weiss said.
So, when Weiss started hanging out with an eclectic group of elite Angelenos, she began to experience the drug-fueled, consequence-free city that Ellis wrote about in Less Than Zero. After a reconnecting with then Amherst College attendee — and fellow Ellis fan — Wallace, the two could not help but see their lives from the perspective of their favorite author.
The bi-coastal friends began writing down their respective escapades and  forming characters based off people they knew in real life, while also collaborating on fictional tales in order to intertwine otherwise unconnected circumstances.
The majority of Weiss’ book contributions were written from her desk at a former fraternity house converted into dorms for transfer students. She would have moments where the ideas would overflow from her soul and the weight of a debacherous night would instantly release her inner darkness as she converted it into words.
Weiss lived  a life of luxury and excess similar to her friends, yet she always felt like an outsider, and the conflicting emotions associated with that were oftentimes unable to be confined to traditional structure. Although Weiss would sometimes read over these frantic stream of conscious sessions and attempt to edit them, her parts of Stalking Bret Easton Ellis are mostly an assemblage of several years’ free-flowing writings.
“My darkness has been the impetus for a lot of creativity because I have so much inside of me that I need to figure out,” Weiss said. “I take solace in writing. It keeps me sane.”
After graduating from USC with a B.A. in political science and a minor in cinema television, Weiss and Wallace were finally ready to release their book. They wrote over 270 query letters to agents and publishing companies before taking an opportunity with Weiss’ father, who owns iUniverse, one of the largest companies for supporting self-publishing in North America.
Stalking Bret Easton Ellis was released this past April and the pair are working together on a screenplay, trying to figure out their next collaborative effort. Weiss is following her other passion, film and television, and works in development at Magical Elves, Inc., the reality show production company responsible for Top Chef, Project Runway and Last Comic Standing.
“I came to Los Angeles to be in the [film] business but writing is another passion of mine,” Weiss said. “I think I can do both.”

Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Conjuring up in the collective mind of America’s citizenry nasty images of fist-slamming old men frothing at the mouth over matters of precious little consequence, politics is so unsexy it’s criminal. It’s a crying shame, really, that this is so, because it means that politics fares most badly among the looks-obsessed — which is to say, among the young.
Until now, right? Obama is largely credited with giving politics its sexy back; young people rallied behind him in record numbers, elected him president and won back their political voice. Right?
Well, not exactly. Obama merely added a few drops of fuel to the fire, happily taking the credit given him by his loyal band of media followers for single-handedly igniting youth involvement in politics. Actually, that fire started in 2004, with sparks beginning to fly in 2000 — nearly a decade before the age of Obama.
Young people — by polling standards, 18- to 29-year-olds — have always had a curiously on-again, off-again relationship with politics, and are notoriously fickle in their voting trends: up in arms one minute, down for the count the next. In 1972, when the voting age was lowered to 18, they made a particularly grand showing at the ballot box: 55 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted in that year’s presidential election, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.
There hasn’t been that high a turnout since.
After a particularly dismal showing among young voters at the 1996 presidential election — some 39.6 percent — something changed in 2000, a small uptick. Then in 2004, the fire came (back) to life: Nearly 50 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted in that year’s presidential election, which CIRCLE estimates was an 11-point increase from 2000. The controversial Bush-Kerry race — hilariously lampooned by a brilliant JibJab video, which quickly went viral and got kids everywhere talking politics — coupled with inventive new outreach programs and shifts in attitudes essentially re-enfranchised a new generation of young people.
That was 2004.
We have since forgotten this original surge and focused solely on the one which came next, in 2008, which was actually considerably smaller — a fact largely ignored by the media.
Time Magazine called 2008 the “year of the youth vote,” saying of Obama, “His campaign has become the first in decades — maybe in history — to be carried so far on the backs of the young.” The media lavished on the praise, raising its collective hands in exultation and praising Obama for doing the seemingly impossible: getting us to care.
Undoubtedly, Barack Obama’s early victories in the Democratic state primaries last year, especially in Iowa, were due in large part to the youth vote, and no one can say otherwise. But given the exorbitant fuss made over the so-called “youthquake” his campaign supposedly engendered — a breezy term the media couldn’t get enough of — one might have expected a record turnout during the actual election among young voters. Alas, no: Gallup polling found “little evidence of a surge in young voter turnout beyond what it was in 2004.”
Why, then, does Obama get all the credit for galvanizing the youth of America? Part of it is that the surge in 2004 was underreported while the “surge” in 2008 — which in reality was but a couple more percentage points, if that — was vastly overreported. The media wasn’t exactly enraptured by Bush or Kerry, but Obama was another story, a new breed of politician, so fresh (and fresh-faced) with his message of change and audacity of hope that if anything good happened in American politics, there was really only one man to whom credit was indubitably due.
There were other reasons for Obama’s (perhaps undue) lionization among the young, chief being that he was running as a Democrat, and — for better or worse — most newly politicized young people are also often Democrats. Democrats have an easier time gaining young converts. It’s no secret that the young tend to be more idealistic; not surprisingly, the increase in the youth vote from 2004 to 2008 mostly favored the Democrats — though John McCain’s stodginess might be partly to blame for that.
And so it goes: Obama wins.
But really, should we care who gets the credit? Honestly, probably not, and Obama would be the first to say that it matters less what caused the surge in youth voting than the surge in youth voting itself. Time will tell if this trend continues. Hopefully it will. In the meantime, we can rejoice in our newfound civic-mindedness (or more than half of us can), thank a decade of politicians who decided we mattered and hope the flame continues to burn a while longer.
Politics might just be sexy yet.

With all the flowery language used to identify a traditional university — “an institution of higher learning,” “a place for complex educational thought”  or “the breeding ground for tomorrow’s brightest leaders” — it’s sometimes easy to forget that USC is something more than a place where people go to learn.
If you consider other factors, such as the $1.92 billion budget the university will operate on for 2009-10, the $53,708 total estimated cost for undergraduates this upcoming academic year or the $77 million worth of university grants that will be received by continuing students, the school begins to sound like a Fortune 500 company.
At the root of it all, USC is more than a school. It is a business and we, the more than 34,000 undergraduate and graduate students, are the paying customers, shelling out thousands of dollars for our college educations. In today’s economy, just making it out with our diplomas with no more than a couple grand to pay back in debt is becoming less and less common, especially for aid-dependent students already living on tight budgets.
For some, however, the task of paying back loans, given drastic changes to their individual financial aid packages, isn’t just inconvenient — it’s impossible. With their tuition bill suddenly no longer in the realm of manageability, students are sadly faced with no other option but to withdraw.
“We didn’t see it coming but we also should have been told,” said Janet Panen, a junior majoring in public relations. “Some of us signed leases or took out loans thinking we’d be okay. Then when we finally got our [financial aid] packages, just a month before school starts, and it was like panic mode because there was nowhere to turn and we couldn’t afford it anymore.”
Confused students like Panen piled in with their appeals this summer only to find the financial aid department plagued with numerous communication challenges: a website lacking important information, a telephone service so backed up that if callers were lucky enough to get through to an actual human, they had to endure more than half-hour wait time (during some parts of the day, a recorded message told callers they couldn’t be put on hold at all) and finally, delayed responses to e-mails and mishandled document replies.
USC’s failure to communicate sensitively and efficiently with both students and their families resembled a huge corporation being apathetic to customer complaints. Students felt cheated and helpless against an insurmountable, highly bureaucratized system.
“We’re not numbers or formulas,” said Melanie Hoyt, a graduate student studying communication management. “You just can’t treat people this way.”
Among the wave of ambiguity and some anger, the Facebook group “USC Students Face Financial Aid Uncertainty” sprouted, collecting more than 200 members in its first few days. A week later membership rose to nearly 1,500.
The group faulted the university for its lack of transparency with a few changes to aid policies and calculation protocol, putting the burden of ample notification on USC. Others felt the university waited too long to release information.
“Some students were in summer school in the middle of finals when [financial aid] awards finally came out,” Hoyt said. “How could you even concentrate or study for a final when you have to worry about whether or not you can come back next year? It’s a hell of way to go to school.”
But with the effects of the economic recession now reaching all walks of life, is it safe to say that students receiving aid should have rightfully anticipated the possibility of financial aid package decreases?
Well, the answer is: not exactly.
Back in January, the Daily Trojan reported the school’s decision to raise the financial aid budget in an effort to minimize the economic impact on students (the pool increased by 8 percent, or roughly $14 million). While this preemptive move by the university should be applauded, what was unforeseen at the time was the 9 percent rise in continuing student applications for financial aid or the 15 percent increase in the number of continuing undergraduates they would later provide aid to, as cited in a letter to the Facebook administrators from the Office of Admission and Financial Aid.
Not such a shocker is the fact that the economy is the reason behind the jump in demand. And though USC’s $3.7 billion endowment suffered a 1.2 percent decrease in value last year, financial aid was not affected because of it, contrary to popular belief.
To make things clear, USC, a school with the now troublesome reputation of commanding huge wealth, never once intended to keep any deserved funds from its students in need. In fact, officials allocated more money than ever to bolster their financial support.
Still, despite the university’s continued commitment to helping its students, the message and explanation never hit home. As a result, the business relationship between students and management has been bruised, mostly due to the students’ heightened demand for answers and an unprepared department’s resistance and inability to give them.
“After explaining my story, I was told [by a aid counselor] to do what I had to do,” Panen said.
On Aug. 12, in a letter addressed to the Facebook group administrators that was posted on the group’s site, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Katharine Harrington took the first step toward healing, offering help to students, clarifying previously unmentioned material and apologizing for “some serious service issues.”
At this point, it will be up to officials to continuously provide complete information to combat financial uncertainty for USC families and provide more time for them to take action in future. Plans are in place for the department to hold multiple comprehensive surveys and work with students to help Harrington and others better “understand students’ experiences.”
But it simply won’t be enough to update the website or publish a letter. Active and thorough notification should be provided to students well in advance and often. Aid officials must begin leading an interactive dialogue, and never stop.
Harrington has been making an effort in this aspect, as she recently sent an e-mail to students regarding the financial aid snafus, with a pledge to keep the student body informed.
This is one step in the right direction though, as it looks to be the first of many promising steps needed to correct a flawed infrastructure. Group administrator Merisenda Bills felt the Facebook group was an effective way for the top to finally take a closer look at the financial circumstances of people and “notice what the students are actually going through.”
So, while the university may be a business and we may be its customers, USC is also school and we are the students, people who help make this institution what it is — a simple detail which should never be forgotten.

Scene it · Though an uncommon venue, the Scene Dock Theatre is home to numerous School of Theatre performances each semester. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Theaters typically acquire their names in one of two ways: some are named after a generous benefactor who donated an impressive sum of money (thank you, Anna Bing!), while others are named after the venue’s address, such as USC’s McClintock Theatre on McClintock Avenue.
But every so often, a theater earns a title that tells the story of its past — a past that has nothing to do with unimaginative surnames and street names.
One such case is USC’s Scene Dock Theatre located on West 37th Street near the Vermont Avenue gate — an area of campus that students rarely pass on their bicycle commute to class and even tour guides often ignore.
The Scene Dock’s story begins in June 1996 when the Greenroom Theatre burned down in a fire, leaving USC’s School of Theatre one intimate venue short. With no other choice, the theatre department looked to its resources and ultimately decided to convert the old campus scene shop into a 99-seat performing arts space (for comparison, Bing Theatre has a capacity of 500).  Soon, curtain calls were taking place in a tiny theatre that was once home to the power tools used to create scenery for campus productions.
These days, the Scene Dock Theatre retains a sort of funky charm that hints at its humble beginnings as little more than a carpenter’s workshop.
A small courtyard gives way to this modestly sized stucco building with a paneled garage door entrance.  Outside hangs what looks like a blacksmith’s creation — a metallic silver sign with the theater’s name, flanked by overlapping cut-outs of hammers, saw blades and paint brushes that serve as tiny reminders of the building’s history.
“Except for the sign that says ‘theater,’ you wouldn’t know what goes on inside,” Technical Director Duncan Mahoney said.
The Scene Dock Theatre may only be capable of accommodating audiences a fraction of the size Bing can.  It may not have the height, the orchestra pit or the acoustic chops to boot.  But don’t think of the Scene Dock as just some pathetic excuse for a playhouse fit only for the runt of the USC theatre litter — not even for a second.
What the Scene Dock lacks in size it more than makes up for in versatility.  It can support a number of different seating arrangements including the standard proscenium set-up, as well as thrust (audience seated on three sides of the stage) and in-the-round (audience completely surrounds the stage) arrangements.
Associate Dean Jack Rowe, with the assistance of other School of Theatre staff and faculty, calls the shots when it comes to determining which student productions will be performed in each of the five campus theaters — Bing, McClintock, Massman, Village Gate and, of course, the Scene Dock.
“There are certain plays where you need the space of Bing to do them justice.  Some need to be more intimate, and the Scene Dock is perfect for that,” Rowe said.
This fall, the School of Theatre will be putting on its first production of the season — Cindy Lou Johnson’s The Years — in the Scene Dock Theatre.  The cast is made up of only six actors and deals with family troubles and other domestic themes that might be lost or overpowered if staged in a big auditorium-style theater.  On the other hand, some larger productions, such as last spring’s 40-person-plus musical Brigadoon, fare much better when enacted in ample performance space.
Though he admits it’s not an exact analogy, Rowe compares this difference between performing in a Scene Dock-sized theater versus a Bing-sized theater to a close shot and a long shot in a film. When the audience or the camera is closer, there is more nuance available to the performer.
“We’re trying to help young people develop into professional actors.  In the world we live in now, a young actor has to be equipped to do everything — film, large theater, small theater — and we want students to have opportunities in all of those areas.”
So although the Scene Dock Theatre’s primary function has changed over the last decade or so, its basic purpose has remained the same: to provide a space for theatre students to sharpen and perfect their craft — whatever that craft may be.

Panic· Junior Clark Kromenaker, accesses the new panic button application on his smartphone. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
There are already smart phone applications that let users check Facebook, pop bubble wrap and read the newspaper, but one USC student is working to bring an application to campus that could increase student safety.
Tracy Lawrence, a junior majoring in business entrepreneurship, is collaborating with iPhocus Venture Management Group Inc. to offer a panic button application — iLink Wireless — to USC students. The application, which can be downloaded on any smartphone for $13 per month, allows users who find themselves in a dangerous situation to push a panic button on their phone, which then sends their GPS coordinates to safety authorities.
The system also involves 3-D maps that allow responding officers to see a user’s exact floor and room within a building. Lawrence said she worked with iPhocus to map 15 buildings both on and off campus.
Lawrence said she has always been passionate about self-defense and campus safety, so when she saw the opportunity to work with iPhocus, she jumped at it.
“My personal hope is that it helps the credibility of the school,” Lawrence said.
Students said the panic button application could be useful in certain situations.
“It would be a good way to contact DPS in a situation where you may not be able to actually talk on the phone, and to let the people close to you know what’s wrong,” said Alicia Johnson, a junior majoring in neuroscience and French.
Some students, however, said the price of $13 per month was enough to keep them away.
“I don’t think I would pay for it, just because as a college student I don’t have a lot of extra funds and I might not ever actually use the feature,” said Jeremiah Forkkio, a junior majoring in animation and digital arts.
Lawrence is currently in conversation with USC’s Department of Public Safety, Take Back the Night and the Women’s Student Assembly in hopes of forming a partnership with the university and spreading the word about this new application.
“DPS seems really interested in working with it,” Lawrence said. “Trojans Alert was their first dappling with technology so they haven’t done anything this advanced.”
DPS Chief Carey Drayton said although he thinks the idea sounded good on paper, DPS has not yet decided if it will partner with iPhocus.
“There’s a big difference between a sales pitch and the product actually working,” Drayton said. “I’ve seen a lot of good ideas come and go.”
If DPS decides not to partner with iPhocus, an independent safety patrol close to campus will respond to users who push the panic button,  Lawrence said.
Lawrence said iPhocus is aware that many students may have privacy concerns, but iPhocus has special privacy features that can be turned off or on. When turned on, DPS would only see a user’s GPS coordinates when the panic button is pushed. If the privacy settings are turned off, DPS could see a user’s GPS coordinates at all times.
iPhocus is also working with UCLA, UC Berkley and George Mason University. Lawrence said George Mason is probably furthest along in mapping and integrating the software, but that iLink Wireless is still a new product and USC is one of the forerunners.

Despite the recent economic decline, an independent study has found that USC’s economic impact on the Los Angeles area has risen nearly $1 billion in three years.
A study conducted by Economic Research Associates found that USC — the city’s largest private sector employer — has an economic impact of $4.9 billion per year on the region, compared with a $4 billion economic impact in 2006.
Economic impact measures the effect on employment, income and spending generated by a decision or policy. The study of USC’s economic impact measured the effect on spending and employment in the surrounding area relative to USC’s projects, spending and policies.
The study accounted for USC’s operational expenditures, but did not include the direct spending or impact of USC’s affiliated hospitals. According to the study, for every dollar USC spent in Los Angeles County, an output of 63 cents was generated somewhere else in the regional economy.
Councilman Bernard Parks, whose district includes USC, attributed the increase in economic impact to the construction happening all around campus. He added, however, that USC has always been a positive force in the Los Angeles economy.
“The hiring of students and the hiring of locals, those have been a staple for a long time in the Los Angeles region,” Parks said. “There’s a very positive impact USC makes anywhere from the adoption of local schools, the maintenance of their campus and the area around it and the benefits of having some 40,000 students in the local area supporting businesses.”
During the 2008 fiscal year, the study found USC spent $130 million on capital projects. Other expenditures included $21 billion in total direct spending, $1 billion in wage and payroll expenditures and $430 million in purchasing expenditures.
Students and visitors also contributed to the university’s economic impact, as students spent $503 million for goods and services and visitors spent about $12 million.
James Grant, director of USC Media Relations, said the university has always had a large economic impact.
“USC has been a major part of the community since, well, more than 125 years,” Grant said. “The bottom line is that USC and its economic impact is a bright spot in what is a very uncertain economy right now … Despite economic issues, USC continues to help fuel this local and regional and national economy.”
Parks said the economic and cultural contributions that USC makes as a corporate citizen of Los Angeles have a very positive impact on the surrounding area.
“[A corporate citizen is] somebody that understands their mission as it relates to their particular job, but is always looking to incorporate the local community in the configuration of their decision-making,” Parks said. “The USC community is not just an inclusive group that grinds out students, gets tuition and goes home … they’re also giving as much as they’re getting from the community.”
Aaron Yee, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, said the economic impact USC has on its surrounding area is probably the most significant effect USC has on its community.
“It’s definitely the economic generation that the university brings to the city, since suburbanization and sprawl have taken so much industry and financial resources away from the city core,” Yee said. “I think USC and its needs are serving as a catalyst for revitalization of this area.”

During college, eating ceases to be enjoyable. Grabbing a bite for that rumbling stomach eats up studying time we can’t afford to lose and food becomes merely fuel to make it through lectures and exams.
USC is well aware of this and has surrounded our campus with quick-fix sustenance centers — an abundance of vending machines, the much-loved dining halls and the food court at University Village. But because having the same Cliff Bar breakfast and Mongolian BBQ platter lunch gets old after the first few weeks, here are a few lesser-known on campus spots for when you have some coveted extra time to feed the beast.
Tutor Café
Located in Tutor Hall at the Viterbi School of Engineering, Tutor Hall Café features a static menu of sandwiches and salads that are made to order in front of you as well as a daily rotation of hot entrees such as Cuban chicken with black beans and plantains and curry chicken with carrots, potatoes and cauliflower. Indoor seating is available in Tutor Hall’s marble cavern, while the outdoor patio seating (with outlets for computers) is surrounded by a tranquil, shaded fountain. Plus, its built-in Peet’s Coffee counter and late weeknight hours (midnight Monday to Thursday!) make Tutor Café a perfect Parkside pit stop.
Popovich Café
Tucked away in the most southeastern corner of campus on the bottom floor of Popovich Hall, Popovich Cyber Café is one of the most versatile eateries at USC. With a fully stocked grab-n-go section (think Trojan Grounds) and a heavily manned open kitchen, Popovich provides busy Marshall students with everything from breakfast burritos to Columbo frozen yogurt. As the only place on campus to get a hot breakfast and have MSNBC blaring out of two flat screen TVs, Popovich Café feels more like a Manhattan cafeteria than a campus restaurant, so take your grub outside to the courtyard and pretend that Exposition Boulevard isn’t on the other side of the wall.
Law School Café
Hidden in the far west corner of the basement of the Musick Law Building, the Law School Café opened in 2005 as part of the  unveiling of the refurbished Asa V. Call Law Library located next door. The cafe has a huge curving counter that offers daily hot entrées, pre-made salads and some of the best paninis on campus. It’s a great stop any time of day as they stock breakfast pastries, frozen yogurt, coffee and an assortment of cold beverages. The Law School Café also has organic chips and snacks, decent vegetarian options and a huge mess hall so you can hit the laptop while you’re chowing down.
Café-teria · Cafe 84 hosts chain stores like Wahoo’s Fish Taco. - Ian Elston| Daily Trojan 
Café 84
Across the walkway from the Lyon Center, Café 84 is a college student’s food-court dream. Enter the turnstile on the west entrance of Kings Hall and the food options begin to feel overwhelming. Café 84 offers breakfast, lunch and dinner from places like Jamba Juice, Starbucks Coffee, Casa Italiana, Wahoo’s Fish Taco (a SoCal staple) and Krispy Kreme doughnuts. There is also a counter to get customized burgers, salads, pizza and wok-cooked noodle dishes as well as a variety of breakfast goodies (single-serving cereals and bagels) and refrigerators full of pre-packaged sushi, sandwiches and cold drinks.
Galen Center
The Galen Center is hard to find not only because it shares its name with the gigantic sports complex on Figuroa Boulevard, but also because its location behind Heritage Hall makes it less conspicuous than any other eatery. Despite its unassuming real estate, this sports-themed dining center is one of the best places to eat on campus. Although it is mostly used by athletes and faculty, the Galen Center is open to the public for lunch from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. — a rotating selection of the best hot entrees on campus (like New York steak and Chilean sea bass) are served from behind a cafeteria-style counter. The diner-esque eating area is lined with cardinal and gold booths, the walls are plastered in USC sports memorabilia and the room is surrounded by flat screen TVs all tuned to ESPN. Be careful when you drop by, though, as the facility is also rented out for team meetings, group dinners and post-game feasts.

Last year, I was lost. Well, not geographically speaking (though I did get lost an embarrassing number of times on campus). Rather, I was stuck at a crossroads of career choices — somewhere in No Future Land.
My compass vanished early in the year when I got cold feet about my print journalism major. From then on, I became a hopeless case of collegiate confusion: I enrolled in random courses, compulsively browsed USC’s list of majors and minors and dumped my problems on unsuspecting college advisers
“I don’t know what to do,” I’d tell them, hoping that they would lay out my future for me in black and white.
“Well,” they’d say with a shrug. “You’re still a freshman. You have time.”
I was forlorn. How was I supposed to pick a major, a career? The options were infinite; I was tempted to pick something out of a hat and hope for the best.
Thankfully, I didn’t have to resort to the hat, because my two summer internships — one at LG CNS in Seoul, Korea, the other at CityBeat, a weekly newspaper in Cincinnati — pointed me in the most unexpected directions.
My first day of work at the LG CNS multinational headquarters in Seoul was a blaring warning of the drudgery that was to come.
I arrived at the imposing building in a black blouse an incredibly bright floral skirt — my first mistake, as I realized once I wedged myself into an elevator full of black suits.
When the traveling can of sardines reached the 13th floor, the overseas business unit, I stepped out into what I can only describe as a sea of gray. The carpet, the cubicles (of which there were many), the walls, even the people looked ashen.
No colors, photographs, personal trinkets or traces of happiness were to be seen anywhere. As I walked past, I sensed heads turn — but only briefly, as there was work to be done.
My introductions were conducted in the most proprietary manner, complete with courteous bows and guarded smiles.
And then I was directed to my cubicle — my own prison-like abode — and handed a laptop, a bunch of pamphlets about LG and their products, projects and offerings (yes, they do more than make your touchscreen phone) and nine hours to kill.
Needless to say, those were the longest nine hours of my entire life.
“It’ll get better. The first day is always the worst,” my dad told me reassuringly on the phone that night.
But it didn’t get better.
Day after day, I found myself in the same place: staring at a computer screen, fighting off headaches and waves of drowsiness in my drab cubicle. While the diligent employees around me clacked away on their overworked keyboards, sealing huge deals with foreign companies, I could barely muster enough energy to stay awake.
But I did try — I downed an average of five cups of coffee before noon, brought snacks to help me concentrate, and wore my best buttoned-up attire. But the coffee went straight to my bladder and not my brain; the snacks were both too loud and too messy and my colorful (albeit conservative) wardrobe stuck out like a sore thumb amidst the black pencil-skirt crowd.
Sure, I gained a respectable paycheck and business experience that’ll look good on my resume, but I was miserable. Don’t get me wrong: My month at LG CNS was a good experience, and I’m grateful for the opportunity. But it wasn’t creative, or inspiring, or me.
Before LG, I thought that international business could be a good fit: Traveling was my first love, and big-name corporations always seemed to have a glamorous appeal.
Yet when push came to shove, I really didn’t care about legal tenders or profit margins. I hated sitting in a hierarchical office with a bunch of boring suits. The whole time, I felt like a fraud: I smiled politely when what I really wanted to do was scream, run around the office, and snap people out of their Office Space stupor.
And that’s when I realized something: No matter how great the monetary incentive, I could never do something I’m not passionate about. It’s like what Jack declares in What Happens in Vegas: “I’d rather do nothing and be happy than do something I know I don’t love.”
The only way to find out whether you love something or not, before you’re stuck in a job you hate, is to intern. And through my stint at LG CNS, I found out what I didn’t love — an invaluable, semi-painful experience.
On my first day at CityBeat, an alternative news and entertainment weekly in Cincinnati (my hometown), a yappy terrier was the first to welcome me to the office. The second was my “boss,” Danny — a scruffy, tattooed 20-something wearing the most beautiful work suit I’d ever seen: a T-shirt and jeans. The third was a droopy basset hound.
You could almost hear my internal sighs of relief.
After a laid-back introduction with Danny (and the dogs), I met my other “boss” Maija, a spunky, foul-mouthed hipster in her twenties with blunt-cut bangs — a real-life Zooey Deschanel if I’ve ever seen one. At this point, my only concern was that I wasn’t cool enough for the job.
Talk about a 180. In place of the stale surfaces of corporate were walls plastered with posters and event flyers. Instead of a dress code, CityBeat invited individuality — which could mean anything from jean cutoffs to tank tops. And in the place of a harshly regulated office was a laid-back, anything-goes work environment.
During my shifts (eight hours a week, with flexible days — not bad at all), I worked on arts and entertainment listings, helped copy-edit and fact-check and wrote occasional articles. Outside the office, I wrote for the website’s blog —not because I had to, but because I wanted to.
I never found myself staring at the clock; my shifts flew by. And despite my lowly status, I felt like I belonged.
Maybe it was the hilarious debates we had in the office about Bruno. Or the socially flagrant, left-wing posters in the women’s bathroom. Or the response I got when I asked my bosses whether there was a measure of decorum I should hold onto in my articles (the answer was a glorious, unanimous “no!”).
But whatever it was, this much was for certain: I loved being able to express myself without a filter. I loved not having to check whether my e-mails or office behaviors were acceptable in some unspoken code of conduct. I loved wearing bright skirts to work. And I loved the dogs.
One involved multimillion dollar deals and conservative two-piece suits; the other, blogs and a nonexistent dress code. My internships might have been radically different, but together, they helped me discover where I wanted to be — and where I didn’t.
There’s a train of thought that freshman year is too early for internships. As a successful product of not one, but two of them, I beg to differ. You might think you know exactly what you want to do with your life, but until you get out there and try careers on for size, you never know which one will fit. Freshman year isn’t too early; it’s the perfect time to play the field before it’s too late.
For me, my internships weren’t just a resume booster. They gave me a boost of faith in myself — and my major — when I needed it most.

Long before sports pundits, bloggers and vaguely indignant students condemned him for inciting yet another Trojan sports ’SCandal, Tim Floyd didn’t have a whole lot going for him in the court of public opinion. The figurehead for USC’s woefully unpopular basketball program never had the avuncular charm or tech savvy of football darling Pete Carroll, nor Carroll’s advantage of heading up a star-studded NCAA colossus.
What Floyd did have was captainship of the Pac-10’s sinking Titanic, and, as spring progressed, he seemed ready to bail at any time. At the end of March, following a devastating loss to Michigan State and the end of any Final Four fantasies, he flew to Tucson to interview for a coaching position at University of Arizona. Less than a week later, Taj Gibson, DeMar DeRozan and Daniel Hackett made public their decisions to opt for the pro draft, a blow that left Floyd so far up the creek without a paddle he was in Deliverance territory.
By the time Yahoo! Sports published allegations in May that Floyd gave at least $1,000 in cash directly to one of O.J. Mayo’s confidants, the fan was on and the room was stinky. USC was already knee-deep in NCAA allegations; the Trojan football program had been under investigation for months as to whether former star Reggie Bush received up to $300,000 in improper benefits when playing at USC. The further accusation that Mayo was courted by Floyd to the tune of something close to $30,000 was not exactly a blemish on an otherwise untarnished surface, though part of the blame fell on the Harold Hill of basketball promoting, slippery Rodney Guillory.
Guillory, according to an almost certainly autobiographical Wikipedia entry, is a Southern California “event promoter.” He was famously involved in a tussle with NCAA rules in 2000 when, working as a runner for a sports agency, he provided former USC guard Jeff Trepagnier and former Fresno State guard Tito Maddox with improper benefits (including plane tickets). This was not something Floyd was unaware of when he agreed to meet with Guillory — after all, when you lie down with fleabags, you inevitably wake up dogged by an NCAA investigation.
This was the case when one of Guillory’s former friends (and, rather inconveniently for him, an ESPN sports writer), released information regarding the shady deal.
The rats fled the burning ship. In an unprecedented diaspora of up-and-coming talent, USC’s top freshman recruits — Noel Johnson and Solomon Hill — bolted for other schools. USC also stopped pursuing Renardo Sidney, another top recruit whose precarious eligibility could have entrenched the school in further NCAA trouble. Super-super senior Marcus Johnson decided to opt for the NBA Draft, even though the USC athletic program had just won him a sixth year of eligibility.
In the wake of losing all but one player who averaged more than 18 minutes of playing time a game last season, Floyd (not-so-voluntarily) tendered his resignation June 9, leaving open a position that few were vying for. While he did manage to somewhat invigorate the program before his departure — under his reign, the Trojans participated in a (sadly, USC record-breaking) streak of three straight NCAA tournaments — the added baggage of the recruiting scandal would mean whoever stepped in would have a lot on his plate.
Enter Kevin O’Neill, USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s fourth choice for the job. Though O’Neill has a reputation for brusque methods and an abrasive personality, at least he doesn’t come with a history of illegally buying players. It’s time for USC officials to stop turning a blind eye to fairly obvious machinations. Guillory’s shady reputation preceded him, and his undue influence in the scandal presented bigger problems within USC’s recruiting process.
USC’s decision to stop pursuing Renardo Sidney can be seen as a step in the right direction, a chance to distance itself from more trouble. (At the same time, it’s also a prime example of the pot calling the kettle litigious.)
We can only hope O’Neill’s appointment marks a necessary turning point in the Trojan sports franchise; if the USC athletic department is truly committed to maintaining a clean record, the first step is to hire coaches who will uphold that ideal.
The scandal should also, however, serve as a reminder for all branches of Trojan athletics that transparency is key. The NCAA would have undoubtedly considered issuing a more lenient punishment if any relevant officials had disclosed information about Floyd’s actions to the committee. As it is, it may be many months until a formal punishment is issued.
It’s time for O’Neill to accept the consequences on behalf of the organization and work toward rebuilding a franchise that has been floundering both ethically and on the court. USC must wash Floyd out of its hair and carry on its way.

When USC graduates of decades past return to visit their alma mater, the reality that sets in as they step onto campus must be staggering. As they stroll along Trousdale, remembering the places  where they learned or lived, they realize that the USC they attended no longer exists.
In just 10 years, widespread growth and expansion have fundamentally changed USC’s institutional identity.
Concretely, USC has evolved from a commuter school into a full-fledged residential university. To accommodate this seismic shift, USC has added more housing complexes, dining facilities and recreational options.
The university’s institutional growth has been no less remarkable. In the last decade, many of USC’s pre-professional schools  have invested millions of dollars in facilities and research that have thrust them toward the cutting edge of technological and intellectual innovation.
The change that has grabbed hold of this university over the last 10 years has been extensive by any measure. What we — the USC students of the 2010s — can gain from looking back at the last decade is the understanding that change on this campus, though often hard to see firsthand, is happening all the time.
Over the next 10 years, the USC community will continue to grow by leaps and bounds. With two new capital construction projects near completion and the 30-year Master Plan on the verge of city approval, an important conversation is set to take place that will determine how this university will fit into its surrounding community.
The educational experience USC offers will also continue to evolve as our academic momentum powers us forward.  Change is inevitable. But, as USC’s current students, we have a unique opportunity to help decide what its impact will be.
That means giving professors feedback, approaching administrators with comments or complaints, participating in student-run organizations and, most of all, lending your ears and your voices to the ongoing campus discourse where decisions are constantly made about what it will mean to be a USC student 10 or 20 or 30 years from now.
Most of us will probably return to campus at some point, years after our graduations. The question before us all now is, when we do, how much of that campus will be ours?

In an effort to adjust to a rapidly shifting job market, the Viterbi School of Engineering will offer four new graduate degrees this fall, including ones in green technology and health systems.
The four Masters of Science degrees — Green Technologies, Electrical Engineering (Electric Power), Health Systems Engineering and Financial Engineering — provide interdisciplinary education with schools such as the Marshall School of Business and the School of Policy, Planning, and Development.
Administrators hope the new degrees, which have been in development for three years, will prepare graduates for an industry focused on cost efficiency that is looking for creative solutions.
Carolyn Suckow, director of Student Affairs for Viterbi’s Master’s and Professional Programs, said the school decided to institute the new programs in order to stay up to date with the needs of society and the private and public sectors of health and energy development.
“What we see in the news, what our researchers tell us, what students are asking for — that’s what determines why we add new degrees,” Suckow said.
Jim Moore, department chair of Viterbi’s Daniel J. Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, said the degree was created to address two needs: the need for more well-prepared graduates and the need for more graduate engineering students with undergraduate engineering degrees.
“It was apparent that many areas, especially the arena of health care, will expand rather rapidly in coming years,” he said. “It seems we ought to be attempting to structure curricula that would draw graduate students here and allow them to compete.”
The M.S. in Health Systems Engineering, Moore noted, will teach students tactics which could be effective in changing the way the health care system is approached in the United States.
The other degrees also aim to prepare students to address societal problems.
Electrical power engineering will prepare students to work toward more sustainable goals for powering the country. The masters in financial engineering, already offered by schools like UCLA and Columbia, will teach students to combine math, finance and engineering — skills useful in fields such as investment banking and insurance policy work. The degree in green technology will focus on creating solutions to global demands for energy and energy efficiency problems.
All four degrees will also be offered online through Viterbi’s Distance Education Network. DEN was also part of the impetus to create the degrees, providing information about students’ needs and the demands of the workplace, Moore said.
“Here at Viterbi, we’re basically stalwarts — we do research, we teach classes, we publish papers and we’re not the most businesslike people in the world,” Moore said. “DEN was able to say, ‘Look, here’s the business opportunity. Here’s what we think the faculty should do to meet societal needs.’”
Though the beginning class size is between 20 and 30, Raghu Raghavendra, a senior associate dean for strategic initiatives, said professors hope the program will eventually include as many as 100 students.
“New programs start small,” Raghavendra said. “We hope that our students will find these new degrees useful.”

Virtual realities  · Of the several interactive worlds the pair has created together, Flower (above) is a poetic exploration of the relationship between urban bustle and nature’s serenity. flOw (below) takes its players on an aquatic adventure through a whimsical blogosphere. However quirky they sound, one thing’s for certain — these are not your kid brother’s games. - Photos courtesy of thatgamecompany 
Kellee Santiago and Jenova Chen possess the souls of poets. The young video game developers stand decidedly against the mainstream industry — artistic auteurs, the avant garde for a new wave in a still-immature entertainment medium.
“Imagine Hollywood without any action films, any superhero films, any special effects films — everything is just deep social reflective films,” Chen explained. “We want all the colors in the spectrum. The reason we work on the games we work on is because we felt the spectrum is kind of biased toward one or two types of colors.”
Santiago and Chen are president and creative director, respectively, of thatgamecompany, a design studio they founded in 2006 while students in the School of Cinematic Arts’ Interactive Media MFA program. After Cloud, the beautiful free-form online game they created as students, caught the attention of Sony Computer Entertainment, Santiago and Chen garnered a lucrative three-game contract with the PlayStation Network — the fruits of which so far have been flOw (2007) and this year’s Flower.
For such a lucrative contract to come to students in a program that was itself barely two years old was an enormous surprise for both students and faculty.
“To have students from school validated by a publisher the size of Sony Computer Entertainment was incredible and certainly, as a startup, it was an awesome opportunity because it allowed us to experiment and to fail and to learn from that process without worrying about where the next project was going to be,” Santiago said.
For 30-year-old Santiago and 28-year-old Chen, the entire experience has been a whirlwind. The young developers were thrown headfirst into their own business, but said they were prepared and encouraged by interactive media business classes they took while in the School of Cinematic Arts. Of course, Santiago, Chen and the other employees of thatgamecompany faced the same tribulations as any young startup.
“When we first started out the company, a lot of our process was learning how to make good stuff, how to make a better game,” Chen said of the company’s early trials. “Early on we did a lot of crunches. We were passionate. We wanted the game to be good so…”
“…We were stupid.,” interjected Santiago. “We scheduled really poorly. We thought we were immortal,” she said, laughing at the memories of their early days.
Since flOw shipped in 2007, the staff at thatgamecompany has steadily grown from four to 10 members, and Santiago and Chen now find themselves facing new challenges as a business.
“Now we’re shifting to how to build a good company culture, how to keep everybody happy while being efficient,” Chen said.
Company profile · The minds behind thatgamecompany, led by USC alumni Santiago (far left) and Chen (center). Santiago and Chen created their first game together while students at the School of Cinematic Arts.
A significant piece of the success of the games created at thatgamecompany is their experimentation with narrative, something which Santiago and Chen credit to their experiences at the School of Cinematic Arts.
“We had a visual communication class, screenwriting class, a production class and a critical studies class and they ask us to analyze film in terms of story structure, character development, emotional arcs. I felt that became very useful when we create a different experience in another medium. A game has everything that film has, but there’s more, there’s the interactivity, so from that perspective I see video games as a natural extension of the ever-growing mixed media,” Chen explained.
Although Santiago and Chen are standard-bearers of the games-as-art revolution, they are entirely unpretentious about the innovation of their games compared to blockbusters such as Halo 3.
“Our goal as a company is to bring variety to video games, but we don’t think any of the current video games should be excluded or killed off, and we play all types of games in the office,” Santiago explained. “But with those games, what I think is interesting is that even when you look at the sales of Halo 3 and compare it to the sales of Monopoly, it pales in comparison, so although those games are hitting huge audiences, they’re only hitting a fraction of the potential audience that’s out there.”
“It would be totally fine if Halo 3 continues to make money,” added Chen. “That just means more people are playing games.”
While Santiago and Chen, who work out of a Sony Computer Entertainment office with Pentagon-level security in Santa Monica, are mum on their next project — which is still in the beginning phases of development — they suggest that their M.O. will continue to be the artistic and narrative innovation that has defined their products so far.
“We’ve been trying to design — and I think you can see it in Flower  — games that ask the audience to bring part of themselves to the experience to add to it, to really use that aspect of games that defines them, which is that they’re kind of open ended: they depend on interactivity, they depend on someone else to become alive,” Santiago said.
Chen continued, saying, “So while trying to entertain the grown-up games you know we felt we shouldn’t rely on the M-rated content which is violence and sexuality, we wanted to make games that are healthy for anyone to play…”

“…and relevant to their live,” Santiago concluded.

Revitalized · USC students stand in front of the Nokia Plaza in Downtown LA, which now offers an array of entertainment options. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
For decades, Trojans have looked toward UCLA’s neighborhood with envy, begrudgingly admiring its endless lineup of quality shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. Finally, as Downtown’s spectacular LA Live project nears completion, USC has its answer to Westwood.
But now that LA Live and all its restaurants and hangouts are part of USC’s backyard, with the 14-screen Regal Cinemas just over the horizon, the only question is: How student-friendly will the complex ultimately be?
Both USC and LA Live have independently expressed interest in developing what seems like an obvious partnership, but plans on both sides are in the early stages and the lines of communication between the two appear to be few and far between.
Lee Zeidman, senior vice president and general manager of LA Live, STAPLES Center and Nokia Theatre LA Live, said Regal Cinemas, a new movie theater set to open in November, “was put together with the thought that it would be a tremendous opportunity for students to come.”
He added that Club Nokia caters to students’ taste with its hip playlists and restaurants such as ESPN Zone could be a potential hotspot for away game viewing parties.
The complex has an obvious appeal to the USC community, but no visible effort has been made thus far to specifically attract students. Zeidman said LA Live offered discounts for Downtown residents, including USC’s neighborhood, over the summer but there was no specific USC student discount.
Zeidman acknowledged  that students are part of LA Live’s target demographic and the subject of appealing to USC and other local students is on the agenda at LA Live’s September marketing meeting.
“We view USC as big partner to LA Live. We do the Pac-10 tournament down here [at STAPLES Center] and we have a lot of USC students who come to the game,” he said. “We’re trying to come up with ways that help USC students become part of the area, once school is back in session.”
Many students said they are enjoying the new entertainment options offered by LA Live, but that they don’t currently feel it’s accessible enough.
“Transportation would be nice. You can take the bus but something else would be easier,” said Rachel Neyssani, a senior majoring in theatre. ‘’I didn’t even know about LA Live until like May. I think they need better promotion if they want us to come.”
In terms of transportation, Zeidman said LA Live is currently “in negotiations with the city and stakeholders throughout the city” to have shuttles that come from USC to LA Live.
“We haven’t talked to the effect of how much it’s going to cost,” he said. “Right now, we’re discussing the route and weekends versus weekdays.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Holden Slusher, who made LA Live part of his campaign platform last spring along with Vice President Ashlie Chan, said the last time LA Live approached USC administrators about providing a tram service was in 2007, back when he was assistant director of campus affairs. He said no money was offered to move the project along. Since then, Slusher said, USC has been brainstorming ways to fund transportation for students.
“There was no money coming from either side. LA Live was up for a tram, but they had no money to throw at the tram. If they had funds to contribute to the project, that would fast-forward the process,” Slusher said.
Chan said that with the opening of Regal Cinemas on the horizon, “student interest has spiked.” Slusher added that the theaters would be an alternative to schlepping out to see movies at the Grove, “which is so far away.” He said the cost of transportation to USC would not be exorbitant if students were using it often.
Chan said USC Transportation “tentatively said they would provide transportation as a trial period during a weekend to gauge student interest.”
USC officials said while plans have been discussed, nothing has been finalized.
Jeff Shields, associate director of USC Transportation administration and operations, said, “We have had some internal discussions regarding the possibility of providing a shuttle to LA Live, but at this time there is not a concrete plan to incorporate one into our operation.”
Shields suggested that, at least for now, students share a cab to and from the venue.
It wouldn’t be the first time that a USC tram would transport students to an entertainment destination. Last year, USC Transportation introduced Route D, which drops students off at the 901 Bar & Grill and 29th Street Café.
Slusher and Chan insist that providing transportation is more about safety than a matter of providing an escape from academia, however.
“It might be a couple miles or so to ride a bike, but it’s not good to ask students to ride their bikes. We don’t want kids to ride back if they’ve had drinks for Happy Hour at the Yard House,” Slusher said.
Ideally, he added, trams would run between 5 p.m. and midnight on Thursdays and Fridays, and all day on Saturday.
Shields said, “We certainly think a shuttle to LA Live is worth looking into, but it will ultimately come down to demand and funding.”
Student discounts could also entice USC students to head to LA Live. Slusher said he has a separate project just getting off the ground which could result in LA Live student discounts. He hired a company called Student Savings Club that contacts the top 50 businesses USC students said are most desirable and attempts to negotiate favorable discounts. Among the top 50 are Yard House and Regal Cinemas.
Because the USG Senate must vote on whether to pay Student Savings Club $1,750, hinging on whether the deals are favorable, nothing is set in stone, Slusher said.
USC and LA Live have each reflected on ways to better integrate the Trojans into Downtown Los Angeles. Whether they’ve communicated their plans to each other is another story.

School of rock · (above) Associate Dean Christopher Sampson oversees the school’s new pop music program. 
Popular music has endured numerous reincarnations since it first solidified itself as a genre in the 1950s.
In the 1960s, it was engulfed by the British Invasion. The 1980s saw the rise of made-on-MTV solo artists like Michael Jackson and Madonna, a trend that remained strong in the 2000s with the help of teenyboppers and the widespread appeal of  “American Idol.”
In the next decade, it could very well be the students you see dragging guitars, basses and even a “rock” violin around campus.
This coming fall, popular music is once again undergoing a reincarnation as USC’s Thornton School of Music unveils its bachelor of music degree in popular music performance. But rather than reformatting the genre, Thornton is returning to popular music’s roots.
“We’re taking an extremely open definition of popular music: For us, it’s any style or genre that has the song as its principal repertoire,” said Christopher Sampson, associate dean of the division of popular music and industry studies. “It’s intended to be a very, very broad umbrella that encompasses a lot of different styles.”
Instead of cultivating the next glittered pop star or charismatic band donning pudding-bowl haircuts — images many associate with the term “pop music” — Sampson assures that the major, which was five years in the making, will explore the breadth of the relatively young genre’s already extensive library.
“Rock, R&B, gospel, blues, Latin … Each one has their own language, performance technique and nuances,” Sampson said. “If somebody’s going to be successful in performing or writing in the popular music world, they’re going to need to understand those traditions and subtleties.”

Yet there’s one long-standing tradition Sampson and the rest of the faculty at Thornton are ignoring — that music performance majors must choose between a strictly classical or jazz curriculum and nothing else — a tradition that Sampson admitted was fitting for some burgeoning musicians yet stifling for others.
“We saw students were wanting to draw outside of the lines of the standard performance offerings [of classical and jazz],” Sampson said. “They were understanding that they need to diversify their skills as well as recognizing that their influences were crossing all kinds of genres.”
This meant Thornton had to draw outside of the lines as well. The launch of Thornton’s popular music performance major is not only a landmark event at USC, but also on the national stage, for this innovative program is the first of its kind at a major university (many universities hold courses in the study of popular music, but none have a major in the actual performance of the genre).
While being the leading model for the rest of the nation’s music schools sounds like a rather daunting task, Sampson claims that the decision to incorporate the program seemed only natural, given USC’s home in Los Angeles.
“Because of our location in LA, there’s a rationale behind offering this program,” Sampson explained. “It’s entirely intended to reflect the changing music industry.”
Not only has Los Angeles been consistently at the forefront of prominent music scenes, the city is also the current hub for music recording, making Los Angeles the prime location for any aspiring musician, songwriter, manager, promoter or recording engineer.
As those two very different aspects of music have long coexisted in Los Angeles, a large part of the program focuses on the integration of the popular music performance majors with those majoring in music industry — a key distinction between the popular music and classical and jazz majors.
“The music business and technology are extremely important to the popular music world,” Sampson explained. “Our music industry students are going to work directly with these new performance students to basically form a miniature music network, which is the type of thing they would experience in the real world.”
The program’s incoming class of 28 students is comprised of 22 freshmen and six transfers, all with various concentrations such as drums, vocals, songwriting and of course, that “rock” violin. To further heighten that sense of the “real world,” the program’s core class organizes this diverse community of popular musicians into small bands, where they learn how to create arrangements, rehearse as a group and  enhance their performance technique by playing before audiences.
Another unique aspect of the major utilizes the newly instated Roland Drum Lab, which was opened during the Spring 2009 semester through Thornton’s partnership with the Rowland Corporation, a leading manufacturer of electronic instruments. As part of their training, each popular music major will take a course to become drum set proficient, regardless of his or her concentration.
“The concept of time awareness and groove is critical to feel the beat along with your colleagues,” Sampson explained. “There’s no better way to learn this but by actually feeling it and playing the drums.”
The only question that remains, then, is why would an aspiring rock musician spend the money on this degree program when popular musicians are notorious for finding their musical footing outside of classroom walls and on the streets with other like-minded, musically inclined friends?
“This program isn’t intended to replace the learn it on the streets mentality — it was meant to reflect a changing music marketplace,” Sampson said. “For a special type of rock or pop musician who wants to diversify their skill sets and go about this in an extremely smart and thoughtful way, this program is an appropriate fit.”

USC may be enjoying more financial stability than UCLA and its other beleaguered, publicly funded counterparts, but that hasn’t stopped the university from extending its campus-wide staff hiring freeze — originally set to end two months ago — until June 2010.
USC officials said the extension was imposed in the interest of saving money under the current economic circumstances, but they emphasized that the freeze is merely precautionary and not indicative of financial strife.
“We are not having those kinds of serious economic challenges that other schools are,” said Elizabeth Garrett, vice president for academic planning and budget. “At the same time, we know we live in a world that is very different than the world three or four years ago. We want to be careful with the resources we have.”
Garrett said there are no specific saving or job-shedding goals for the freeze, and that USC has yet to test the freeze’s effect on the university’s savings.
“This is more of an effort to be prudent as opposed to reaching any percentage cut,” she said.
Garrett also noted that USC’s employees are not incurring the kinds of pay cuts plaguing some California public university payrolls.
The hiring freeze has been in effect since November 2008, when university officials announced that USC would temporarily stop hiring and replacing university staff. But rather than simply halting the hiring process, the university opted to put 400 open positions up for review. Many were eliminated, but some critical jobs were filled. Since then, the university’s approach to hiring has been generally cautious, but sensitive to the critical needs of the community.
Garrett said requests for hires are considered on a case-by-case basis. Departments wanting to hire staff members must explain why the position is necessary to the university and then the provost’s office makes a decision.
“We don’t approve everything that’s asked,” Garrett said. “We’ve been very firm with the schools in making it clear to them that we expect them to only request exceptions when they have very good cases.”
Currently, USC is hiring for approximately 600 positions, 300 of which are patient care positions at the USC/Norris Cancer Hospital, said Janis B. McEldowney, associate senior vice president of administrative operations. In February — before the purchase of the hospital — the university was hiring for just 193 positions, compared to 465 at that time last year, McEldowney said.
While the effect of the hiring freeze is palpable among university staff, USC officials said very few employees have lodged complaints.
McEldowney said many of her colleagues even appreciate being forced to conserve resources. For example, Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC Libraries, said having to take a “critical look” at his list of potential hires makes his department more productive.
“We understand the need for caution in this economic climate and we don’t expect that every hire will be approved,” he said. “We’ve found the process to be fair and reasonable. The upside is that it provides one more opportunity to review every hiring decision in the context of the bigger picture — how will the proposed position help us provide library services and collections to students, faculty and staff?” he said.
The freeze is currently scheduled to expire next June, but Garrett didn’t rule out another extension.
“It’s so hard to predict what will happen with the economy,” she said. “As long as we think it’s prudent for this university, we will continue to take steps that have been warranted.”

Branded · The ’SC interlock poker is just one of many items sold in the bookstore that bears the school’s trademarked logo. USC’s Trademark & Licensing department receives hundreds licensee hopefuls per year. - Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan 
The corner of Matt Curran’s new office is filled with boxes and organized piles of clothes on the floor.
Curran, the director of Trademark Licensing and Social Responsibility at USC, along with the rest of his department, was recently  transferred to a freshly painted former dentist’s office on the second floor of University Village — but the mess is not from the move.
Every day, product samples arrive in his mailbox — most printed with the logos and colors of other universities — their creators hoping for the Trademarks & Licensing Services department’s blessing to bear any of USC’s seven identifying marks instead.
Established in 1976, USC’s licensing program was one of the first programs of its kind on a university level. For the last 30 years, TLS has overseen the use of familiar school identifiers such as the USC block lettering, the university seal, the Traveler mascot, “Fight On!,” the Trojan head and the SC interlock.
The crop of prospects in the mound on the floor of Curran’s office are similar to ones that would have poured in 10 years ago — headgear, novelties, apparel — but USC’s commitment to fair labor practices in the last decade has made it harder for these hopefuls to appear on the bookstore’s shelves. USC’s licensing stipulations are some of the most stringent in the country and are now raising the bar for the future of university branding.
As a member of the Fair Labor Association (since 1999), the International Labor Rights Fund (since 2000) and the Designated Suppliers Program (since 2008), USC takes its social responsibility very seriously — and the world is noticing.
Last year, after joining the Designator Suppliers Program —an organization whose members agree to work with only a pre-approved list of fair-labor merchandise suppliers — USC’s licensing services was named the 2009 Synergy Award Program of the Year by the International Collegiate Licensing Association.
The road to royalties, however, still starts with a sample. Every month, a committee of representatives from TLS and other various campus groups holds a meeting where the 10-to-20 items that come in during the month go up on the chopping block and the comittee decides if they are worthy of the right to continue the licensing process.
“The idea is only one piece of the product,” Curran says. “The group has to weigh in on it.”
But getting the committee’s initial approval is the easy part.
While most collegiate licensing programs have some form of fair-labor agreement for licensees to adhere to, USC became one of the first in the country to erase the honor system and require third party factory audits to ensure compliance with the USC Workplace Code of Conduct.
“We’re taking a stand and saying that this is important to us,” Curran says.
The 2007 decision to firmly enforce the Code of Conduct — which includes general workers rights such as minimum-wage pay, overtime compensation and nondiscrimination — costs the university 88 unrenewed licenses from companies either unwilling or unable to meet USC’s new rules.
“It’s been hard to find replacement vendors,” said USC Pertusati Bookstore Director Dan Archer. ”We’ve been able to recover some products but not all.”
Although the stricter standards have driven some brands away, it is a risk that comes with a global gain. USC currently only has around 200 licenses, but all have had their manufacturer’s factories annually inspected by an auditor, ensuring that USC’s fair labor standards are being upheld.
“Part of that [low number] speaks to the nature of what it takes to get a license here,” Curran said. “If you’re not willing to go through the social compliance process, it’s not going to happen.”
USC began its effort to preserve workers’ rights in the late ‘90s during a lull in product sales stemming from poor sports team performances.
“When I came on board 15 years ago, the feeling of the Trojan Family was at an all time low,” Archer said.
But a morale boost in 2002 sparked a $10 million sales increase in general merchandise and the demand for USC-emblazoned products skyrocketed. Licenses were given out for typical fan gear like t-shirts and pullover hoodies, but also more specialized items like the Trojan head string lights and the ‘SC interlock hamburger brander currently in the bookstore.
“You can now find very unique products [at the bookstore], whereas you wouldn’t have seen that before,” Archer said.
The future of USC-branded products, however, might be less about marked up neckties and handcut brandy glasses and more about connecting the school with companies not normally associated with collegiate licensing.
“Because of where we are in L.A. and everything that goes on here, the evolution of the business will be to address the lifestyle options available,” Curran said. “There’s no end to the types of product we’re happy to accept.”

Ah, coffee: it’s not only one of life’s simple pleasures, but also a necessary staple of most college students’ diets. It satisfies, enlivens and aids many sleep-deprived seniors in stay ing awake during late-night study sessions.
USC is packed from one end of campus to the other with coffee shops, ensuring that no matter where you are or what time of day or night, there is a barista waiting with cup in hand to provide you with your desired fuel. Suddenly, all-nighters and 8 a.m. classes don’t seem so impossible.
Trojan Grounds
The appeal of the well-known and loved Trojan Grounds (affectionately dubbed “TroGro”) lies in its convenience and availability — located on the ground floor of Birkrant Residence Hall, Trojan Grounds is the only USC food provider open 24/7. With its late- night hours and close proximity to Leavey Library, Trojan Grounds is a solid go-to when you need a shot of espresso at 3:00 a.m. to cram for a midterm or finish your WRIT 140 paper. The downside to Trojan Grounds, however, is that its coffee options are somewhat limited. Your best bet is to stick with a cup of basic coffee (they proudly serve Starbucks brand) and avoid the lattes, which more often than not leave a bitter taste in your mouth.
The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf
Unlike Trojan Grounds, if you want a latte done right, head across campus to the sparkling new The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf  located in the USC School of Cinematic Arts. The coffee giant has the full menu and quality of every other Coffee Bean store, which means the coffee is always smooth and distinctive while the lattes are creamy and flavorful. In addition, their ice blended drinks are the perfect antidote to the summer heat that is bound to linger on through September. This Coffee Bean even comes equipped with an outdoor courtyard; the only downside is that its comfortable benches and table-seating is located in the heart of the student traffic zone. It’s best to grab Coffee Bean on the run and enjoy it elsewhere — preferably in air conditioning.
 
 

Grounded · Located behind Marks Tower, Ground Zero acts as both a coffee shop and concert venue. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan 
Ground Zero
Tucked away behind Marks Tower, Ground Zero is perhaps USC’s most unique coffee shop. Famous for its out-of-this-world milkshakes, this underground cafe also serves decadent coffee and provides an unbeatable atmosphere. Since Ground Zero also functions as a popular performance venue, its not only a great late-night alternative to Trojan Grounds but also a cheap way to get some quality entertainment without leaving campus.  Ground Zero is my favorite place to meet friends for an afternoon pick-me-up, because with its large plush couches and comfortable mood lighting it reminds me a lot of Central Perk from Friends. The shop’s only drawback (and for some, this is a deal-breaker) is that it is the only on-campus eatery that does not accept Dining Dollars, so be prepared to come with cash, credit card or discretionary funds in hand. I recommend a basic latte or cappuccino, but they also have a variety of flavored syrups in stock to satisfy your sweet tooth.
LiteraTea
If you are feeling less social and need somewhere to study and sip simultaneously (since the libraries are strictly drink-prohibitive), venture over to LiteraTea, located at the very edge of Doheny Library. Although its focus is on tea, a healthier and less-caffeinated alternative to coffee, this cafe offers delicious and bold Peets coffee (typically stronger than Starbucks) and a variety of specialty drinks. There are tables both inside and outside in the Nazarian Pavilion that are quiet and serene — the perfect atmosphere for writing papers or reading a good book.
For caffeine on the go, Starbucks coffee is available at The Lot, Tutor Hall, Café 84 and at food carts in various buildings scattered throughout campus.
The school year may just be beginning, but when classes start to pick up the pace in a couple weeks, students are sure to start pounding back espresso shots. Thankfully, USC offers a wide variety of choices for every type of coffee lover.

Let’s play the word association game.
“California.” Go.
Chances are, most non-native responses will draw from a word bank filled with choices such as “Hollywood,” “Disneyland” and “Schwarzenegger.”
And while those who live in the United States’ most populous state may roll their eyes at these tired and unimaginative Golden State generalizations, there is little doubt that such icons have come to serve as a large part of the ritzy, fantastical aesthetic that most come to associate with the entertainment hub of the world.
As we have seen over the last decade, however, theatrics are not just limited to the movie and resort park industries.
It should come as no surprise  that even politics in California have seen a very decided flair for the dramatic.
The turn of the century saw the emergence of change in the state, with Gray Davis ascending to the governorship in 1999.  Riding a platform based on education, gun safety and health care reform, he marched into the seat of power with a huge groundswell of support.  But mired in an energy crisis that saw rolling blackouts in a state utterly dependent on electricity as well as a nasty budget crisis, favor began to fall out with Davis on a precipitous path not unlike Harvey Dent’s.
However, in a major plot twist, the people of California decided to reelect Davis in the 2003 gubernatorial election.  Unfortunately, his second term was extremely short-lived, as the same people that voted Davis into office effectively Punk’d him by recalling him 10 months later.
Thus, the beginning of the decade started with a bizarre election cycle that played out like a fitful high school relationship, and effectively set the tone for 10 years of spectacle in California.
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s victory in the resulting recall election was as much a symbolic move as it was a legally notarized event, with many a celebrity making their presence felt in the political arena.
For better or worse, the ring of political talking heads that was once an exclusive “old boy’s club” of stuffy college professors and elitist intellectuals merged with the entertainment world. Of course, it could be argued that this marriage took place more than two decades ago when actor Ronald Reagan took on the role of president in 1981.
Because of the increasing popularity of entertainment news and websites devoted to such coverage, however, the permanent spotlight affixed on the Hollywood crowd shines that much brighter today. And while this has afforded the paparazzi every conceivable opportunity to catch celebrities out and about, it appears that has also offered them a convenient on-the-go soapbox; as of late, it seems to have become chic for anyone with at least 15 minutes of fame to use two minutes of it to suddenly voice an opinion on the current state of political affairs.
The hullabaloo surrounding the hotly-contested ballot measure Proposition 8 serves as a prime example in which denouncements about the injustices of the measure became just as commonplace in interviews and media appearances as wardrobe selections and vacation plans. Suddenly, Sean Penn wasn’t just Spicoli, but a rather outspoken and well-read advocate for equal rights.
Even the upcoming gubernatorial race looks to be far more sensational than such an election should be.  At the end of his current term, the Governator will be forced by California law to relinquish the position of governor because of term limit statutes. Ironically, the race for the seat vacated by the Schwarzenegger features a former two-term governor, Jerry Brown.
Confused?
Brown’s been granted the opportunity to run again, as his term was before the current rule regarding term limits was put in place. For those keeping track at home, this means that in the event that Brown ekes out a victory over the field, he will enter his ninth year of service as governor, replacing a governor who maxed out at eight.
California: where the gubernatorial election is more intriguing than the Amazing Race.
Luckily for those whose stomping grounds run from Vermont to Figueroa, USC’s location in the heart of the state’s largest city allows for a very strong relationship with the California political scene. USC students were very much witnesses to the trend of dramatic political happenings over the last decade. This past semester saw a heavy student turnout in Prop 8 demonstrations and local presidential campaigning that took place during the last academic year. Members of the student body were also unwilling participants at times — for example, the numerous close encounters with LaRouchePAC tables impeding the treacherous bike convention at Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard.
The point being, exposure to the political climate of California is not only convenient but inevitable for a USC student.
In the grand theater of California, members of the Trojan student body may only be playing bit parts. However well-intentioned, past efforts to mobilize mass student involvement in politics have been lackluster at best, despite a perceived groundswell in activism in light of the Obama campaign and Prop 8 protests (see: student voter turnout in the California primaries was an epic failure).
But perhaps we’re only waiting for our breakout role in the years to come. After all, even the bit actors get to share the same IMDB.com page with the headliners. Neither Emmy nominations nor Grammy awards are prerequisites for increased participation in the political realm. With the current state of affairs being as unpredictable and uncertain as it is, now would seem like the perfect opportunity to try to steal the limelight and become more interactive within the political arena.
Either way, in using the last decade as a barometer for the future, it doesn’t appear that the extravagant workings of Californian politics will fall under the radar of the national consciousness anytime soon. It’s up to us to ensure that it doesn’t elude the student body either.
Get your popcorn ready.

Cramped bedrooms. Rank-smelling bathrooms. Curious stains on the floor. From the time exhausted freshmen begrudgingly move their belongings into New/North, a building with no air conditioning and no elevator to boot, these “quirks” of dorm life are what undergraduate students come to expect and accept from USC housing.
By making bold strides to implement USC’s ambitious new Master Plan, Curtis Williams has acknowledged that he wants to change that.
Williams, USC vice president for campus development and facilities management and co-chair of the Master Plan team, is one of the power players working on the effort to “provide a visionary framework for the physical development of the campus and the prosperity of its surrounding community in the coming years,” according to the plan’s official website.
Sound vague and unrealistic? That’s probably because it is. While the Master Plan objectives are noble and USC Trustees have appropriated funds for construction, it seems there is not enough land in desirable locations to create rooms that will lure USC students. Problems also exist in how new student housing will affect local residents.
Launched in 2006, the 30-year proposal promises to provide a variety of more affordable USC-owned housing opportunities. Williams and his team are enthusiastic about starting construction to complete the plan’s larger objectives, which include the destruction of the University Village in order to organize the businesses USC students frequent in a new mall and social area, and provide more student housing.
It is the hope of many administrators at USC that the revamped social area located at Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard will provide new nightlife options for those students who would prefer not to get their kicks on fraternity row.
But the most startling statement proponents of the Master Plan have made regarding their intentions to expand USC housing is the plan to supply an additional 7,600 beds for the University Park Campus.
Initially, it seemed as if these lofty goals of the Master Plan that were approved by the USC board of trustees in June 2008 were too broad to come to fruition anytime soon. And although Master Plan construction is not set to commence until late 2010 at the earliest, USC housing has already been making large-scale changes over the last decade in hopes of building a “strengthened community and a true college town,” according to the plan’s Website.
The first of these changes that current Trojans are relishing in is the creation of the Parkside complexes, which were finished in 2007.  With more spacious suite-style residences and a new dining commons area, Parkside International Residential College and Parkside Arts and Humanities Residential College are communities primarily for first-year students.
It is unfortunate that housing officials think they can appease poor freshmen stuck in the worst possible location on campus by simply providing exercise equipment and multiple flavors of pudding, but they definitely can. For now, Parkside residents are content to enjoy their rainbow-sprinkled pudding and then proceed on their 20-minute trek across campus for class in the cinema building.
The Conquest coup is the next accomplishment USC housing has made during the last decade regarding its goal to physically develop the University Park Campus. In 2009 USC acquired the Conquest apartment complexes through the Westar Associates realty company and is looking to make the luxurious and overpriced rooms at Tuscany made famous by quasi-celebrities Rob Kardashian and Lil’ Romeo available to students as off-campus USC-owned housing.
Physical expansions of the University Park Campus such as these have increased the amount of resources and comfortable living spaces undergraduate students have at their disposal. Additionally, student government groups such as the University Residential Student Community’s advocacy board have made improvements to dining and residence halls in buildings that have history at USC and were looking worse for the wear.
Last year under Maya Babla’s leadership, the advocacy board helped to expand sustainability in the dorms with a more efficient recycling program, added bicycle racks in front of student residences, worked with EVK to satisfy students’ dining demands and installed gymnasium equipment in older buildings such as Marks Hall.
Babla, a junior majoring in international relations and communications and the former head of the board, said she and other members focused on improving USC housing “so that it’s somewhere that you desire to live. Not, ‘I didn’t find a landlord in time, therefore I’m stuck in student housing.’ We never want that to be the mentality.”
Developments like those promoted by the advocacy board serve as a strong start, but there is still much more that USC Housing must tackle in order to equip students with residential communities that facilitate academic, social, physical and personal wellness.
Administrators and students alike are anxious to see if these valuable changes serve as a precursor of what is to come with the implementation of the Master Plan. Through groups such as URSC and on Facebook advocacy pages, students have expressed their desires for a cleaner campus, more affordable residences and more resources for maintaining their physical wellness.
Rachel Horn, a former resident of a first-year residential college and an undeclared sophomore, echoed these sentiments when she recalled having “a great experience living in USC housing, I just wish there were more resources in the dorms so they could feel more like homes.”
Students like Horn hope that the Master Plan will provide for all of these needs and more.
For now, USC is not doing enough to accommodate the needs of the students in a holistic way.  Undergraduates pay an astronomical amount for the USC experience — $39,274 for a year’s tuition and thousands more for room and board — and deserve more than just stellar academic programs. USC is known for exceeding excellence in education, athletics and student involvement. The residential experience has been falling behind for a long time and now it is time for the Master Plan to help play catch-up.
Williams and his colleagues are especially eager for the completion of 2010’s construction, as they assert that the new shopping center and improved USC-owned housing will create safer streets, beneficial economic activity and a greener environment surrounding campus.
But many are not so optimistic. It seems as if USC Housing may have bitten off more than it can chew. Since our housing office has problems enough keeping the buildings that already exist up to adequate living standards, students have no reason to put their faith in the abundant promises to provide affordable, enjoyable housing.
And if building space for 7,600 new beds means sticking to their current mode of operation by creating 7,600 miniscule, dungeon-like dorm rooms and apartments, USC’s undergraduate population will likely counter USC Housing’s offer with a resounding “No thanks!”
Additionally, community members are concerned that the drastic increase in USC housing might oust area residents and cause even more economic strife for local realty companies. Plan executives have countered this panic by promising to work closely with private owners in the area to provide beds for students.
Overall, with the combined efforts of USC Housing and student groups on campus, the quality of life for Trojans who live on or around University Park Campus has increased drastically over the past decade. And as we round the corner into 2010 and the beginning of Master Plan construction, members of the Trojan family and the Los Angeles community are eager to see if USC’s efforts to stimulate the community’s pride in our school by providing better housing and shopping centers will succeed.

Every USC student has caught a glimpse of the all-too-familiar brick siding, perfectly trimmed bushes or Trousdale Parkway brimming with bicyclists and skateboarders in the background — or even the foreground — of a feature film, television show or nationally syndicated commercial. For those of us who pass these landmarks on the way to class each day, whenever a hint of USC’s landscape or architecture is flashed in the background of our favorite TV shows, it’s like sharing a best kept secret between those only worthy of knowing — the Trojan Family.
Although USC’s picturesque campus has been a prime filming location for decades, the last 10 years have brought an eclectic array of cinematic projects to the grassy hills  of Alumni Park and the regal entryway of Bovard Auditorium.  Victoria Daves, director of Campus Filming and Special Projects, reasons that in her 15 years at her post, filmmakers have come to USC primarily because of its Ivy League look and its pleasant weather. However, in many cases, it is also somewhat of a homecoming. Daves estimates that in 95 percent of the projects filmed at USC, there’s a Trojan involved.
Since it would be impossible to list every strip of celluloid stained with USC’s cardinal and gold, the following is USC’s top-10 on-camera moments caught in the last 10 years.
Being John Malkovich, 1999
Directed by Spike Jonze.
In this bizarre film that involves puppets, uncomfortably low ceilings and the quiet, unassumingly erudite John Malkovich and the lonely people that long to see things through his eyes. Viewers catch a brief glance of the expansive Bing Theatre stage while Malkovich rehearses for a Shakespearean piece until he is interrupted by his lover, Maxine (Catherine Keener). It’s a short sighting, but a pivotal point in the haunting film.
What Women Want, 2000
Directed by Nancy Meyers.
When womanizer Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) fakes a pleasant call with his teenage daughter Alex (Ashley Johnson) to impress his new boss (Helen Hunt), it’s not on the streets of Chicago, the film’s supposed setting, but sunny Southern California — Alex’s payphone is stationed right in front of Bovard Auditorium’s distinguishable entrance. Nick also conducts research on the female psyche by taking a yoga class in the Physical Education building, room 201, and listening to his classmates’ thoughts in Hoose Philosophy  Library.
Legally Blonde, 2001
Directed by Robert Luketic.
Perhaps USC’s most beloved film role in recent years, Bovard Auditorium once again makes an appearance on the silver screen, this time serving as the dormitory of bright and bubbly Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) in this hilarious albeit classic chick flick. Numerous scenes on Trousdale Parkway were also depicted as the winding paths of Harvard campus.
The Girl Next Door, 2004
Directed by Luke Greenfield.
In this teen comedy, the denouement shows a slow-motion shot of high school loser Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) finally attending the school of his dreams, Georgetown University — representing by a bustling Trousdale Parkway. The girl of his dreams, pornstar-turned-girlfriend Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), waits for him as he exits class, leaning against her trendy baby wblue Volkswagen bug with Doheny Library peeking from behind her shoulder — a cute ending to a typical teen affair.
Herbie Fully Loaded, 2005
Directed by Angela Robinson.
Rebel redhead Maddie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) scampers on her skateboard just in time to snatch her high school diploma as her proud daddy (Michael Keaton) snaps on an archaic film camera. Graduation, of course, takes place on the beautiful grounds outside Doheny Library.
Running With Scissors, 2006
Directed by Ryan Murphy.
In the cinematic adaptation of Augusten Burroughs’s memoir of the same title, a young Burroughs (Joseph Cross) watches his adoptive family bury the family cat, Freud, after it had been held underneath a laundry basket for four days by a zealous and eccentric Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow). The film just might make you weep, and not because the cat died. Burying feelings, even among the canopy of trees in Founders Park, doesn’t do anyone any good.
House, 2007
Episode: “Half-Wit”
Musician Dave Matthews guest stars as a pianist with a mental disability whose miraculous skills begin to deteriorate during a concert held in Bovard Auditorium. Later in the episode, doctors Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) talk on the walkway between Bovard and Founders Park, with a squat, nondescript “Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital” placard standing nearby. While upperclassmen might remember being able to watch Matthews play in the dark auditorium, the grumpy genius doctor was nowhere to be seen.
Electra gum commercial, 2008
Some students might remember craning their necks to catch a glimpse of an aging Carmen Electra donning a bathrobe as she waited in between takes for the 30-second chewing gum spot filmed in front of Bovard Auditorium. Ms. Electra, chewing Electra? Clever, advertisers.
The Office, 2008
Episode: “Weight Loss”
Jim visits his girlfriend Pam while she’s cultivating her passion for drawing at an art school in New York. Pam (Jenna Fischer) serves as a resident advisor for her dormitory at Parsons the New School for Design which is a spitting image of the dorms in Pardee Tower. From the carpet to the dirty wooden doors, Pardee Tower is the leading model for an ordinary college living space.
Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, Christmas Day 2009
Directed by Betty Thomas.
Though this computer animated, high-pitched children’s film might not open until the end of the year, Daves describes the filming as “pretty cute — they had stuffed chipmunk stand-ins do whatever the actions the chipmunks will do, running them up and down in front of the Galen Center.” Just what Alvin, Simon and Theodore will do in front of the athletic facilities is yet to be seen … unless, of course, an insider, ahem, squeaks.

Research · Mark Thompson, co-director of the federally funded Energy Frontier Research Center, looks at samples with a microscope. | Dieuwertje Kast 
Armed with close to $16 million in federal and institutional funding, professor P. Daniel Dapkus is spearheading an initiative to bolster the university’s presence in the burgeoning field of energy research.
Dapkus, who is also co-chair in the USC Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, and colleagues affiliated with the departments of electrical engineering, chemistry, physics, astronomy and computer science received a five-year, $12.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science in April, and will be holding the first planning meetings within the next few weeks.
The grant is part of the Obama administration’s $777 million Energy Frontier Research Center  initiative to accelerate solar cell, biofuel and other energy research.
“Our principal goal is to do basic science research on solar energy conversion and solid state lighting for room lighting and illumination,” said Mark E. Thompson, a professor of chemistry and the center’s co-director. “We also want to develop a better understanding of the devices and study new materials.”
As director of the EFRC for Emerging Materials for Solar Energy Conversion and Solid State Lighting, Dapkus will oversee a suite of projects led by 15 participating faculty, including three from outside universities.
The center, which has full discretion over its funds, will operate independently from USC and the DoE.
In addition, the grant will enable the hiring of 25 new graduate and postdoctoral students.
“Each of the students will gain an appreciation for the challenges and modes of research of the different disciplines and gain a general understanding of the energy landscape,” Thompson said.
The first point Dapkus and Thompson are quick to stress is that they have no intention of building new cells or lights — which may seem counterintuitive given their emphasis on organic solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
Instead, the center plans to focus on developing a better understanding of the underlying components and process — to “take a look at things from the atomic level and engineer them to be the best they can be,” as Dapkus put it.
That could mean exploring the efficiency of new materials, troubleshooting existing ones or developing new structures.
Thompson said the center could eventually bring in business partners to collaborate on new projects and commercialize its work. Even then, Thompson cautions, it would likely take at least 15 to 20 years before the technologies transition from experimental to commercial.
“It’s exciting to work in an area where you’re doing basic science that will lead to something coming out in the marketplace,” Thompson said.
Cost and efficiency — or, more accurately, the lack thereof — are the principal obstacles to the wider deployment of solar cells and LEDs.
According to Dapkus, about a quarter of consumed electricity is used for lighting, of which incandescent bulbs supply a large fraction. Incandescent bulbs are very inefficient because they dissipate most of the electricity they take up as heat.
Compact fluorescent light bulbs, though a preferable alternative because of higher efficiency and longer lifespan, suffer from their own set of shortcomings: cost and their contents — like all fluorescent bulbs, CFLs contain a small amount of mercury, which is toxic to humans.
White LEDs, one of the devices Dapkus’ group is working on, are twice as efficient as CFLs and can emit over the entire light spectrum but are almost 10 times more expensive.
Silicon-based solar cells, which are commonly found in rooftop solar panels have low conversion efficiencies and remain costly compared to conventional fossil fuel-based sources.
Organic solar cells, which are made of low-cost carbon-based materials, offer a promising alternative, but the technology is still in its infancy.
As such, these cells are still too costly and inefficient to make much of an impact beyond the laboratory setting — according to Cody Schlenker, a fifth-year graduate student in Thompson’s lab, they are about a quarter as efficient as silicon-based cells.
“Our goal is to help develop solar cells that will make electricity that is cost-competitive with coal-powered plants,” Dapkus said.
A 10,000-sq. mile area covered by 40 percent efficiency solar cells could theoretically power the entire country, he added.
Schlenker, who will be graduating this year, hopes to take part in the early planning meetings. He is particularly interested in the collaborative efforts the center’s objectives will help foster, both within his department and between the others.
“It gives us a big opportunity to build a new collaborative effort in the chemistry department where we work together with different groups,” Schlenker said.
Separate from the EFRC, Dapkus will also direct the newly established Center for Energy Nanoscience and Technology, which will bring together researchers to devise new projects related to the university’s broader energy initiative.
Though it will primarily draw from researchers in engineering, physics and chemistry, Thompson, who will serve as CENT’s associate director, wants to attract a diverse array of faculty and students.
Ultimately, Dapkus and Thompson hope that the EFRC initiative, combined with the DoE’s other research programs, will rekindle the United States’ dormant energy research sector. Energy research in the U.S. has stagnated in recent decades as other countries, including China, Japan and Germany, have surged ahead.
While Thompson would like to see the federal government inject even more funds into this research, he said he is confident that he and his colleagues will quickly be able to make up for lost ground.

Safeguards ·  Additions at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street will include traffic lights and speed feedback signs. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
As USC’s Master Plan awaits city approval, the school will undertake projects outside the plan’s scope during the fall semester — including improvements to one of the most heavily trafficked intersections near campus.
After a fatal hit-and-run last year, USC has decided to make safety improvements at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street and along Jefferson.
“It’s at the point where we need to do something,” said Director of Entitlements Brian League, who collaborated with the city to put together a plan for changes along Jefferson.
The improvements would include more traffic control signals, automated speed feedback signs along the roads, additional street lighting, pavement patterns at the intersections and the elimination of the church driveway entrance at the intersection of Jefferson and Hoover, League said. The university also hopes to receive a permit from the city to construct a signal at the intersection of Hoover and 28th Street before the start of fall classes.
Most of the improvements will happen during the semester, though USC hopes to have temporary speed feedback signs in place before school starts.
Yet those changes are minor compared to what USC hopes to do if the Master Plan is approved. Under the plan — a broad roadmap for developments in and around campus over the next two decades — Jefferson could become a pedestrian-friendly road that is part of the USC campus.
For now, any Master Plan improvements are on hold. The plan was approved by the Board of Trustees in fall of 2008, but developments can’t start until the city approves its own version of the plan. This is expected to happen sometime in 2010.
In preparation for an Environmental Impact Report, which is required before construction can begin, the city is assessing the impact developments would have on traffic, noise and local residents, both during and after construction.
After the EIR is available to the public — likely early 2010 — the city and USC will respond to comments from community members and USC students, faculty and staff who will be impacted.
Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president of real estate and asset management, said the first project the school proposes would likely include the University Village, Cardinal Gardens and Century Apartments. Raspe estimated that it would take a year to get approval on a project and that ground would be broken by January 2012, at the earliest.
Raspe said the retailers for the new University Village have not been determined, as the new shopping center will likely not open for another five years.
Though changes are still a while down the road, students and community members have already begun to voice concerns.
Shawn Simons is president of the North Area Neighborhood Development Council, a city neighborhood council representing the area that includes USC. He’s concerned that students will flood the community in search of housing if USC tears down Cardinal Gardens and Century Apartments — possibly displacing community members along the way.
“We haven’t really gotten a clear plan from USC about what is going to happen to the University Village area,” he said.
Still, those behind the Master Plan said they believe it will be beneficial to both the university and the community.
“Once the project is complete, it would be a real benefit to the students, faculty and staff of the university as well as the current surrounding community members,” Raspe said.

Tweet, tweet! Do you hear that? No, it’s not birds — it’s the world around you using Twitter.

While Facebook is great for friendships and student organizations, Twitter is a growing medium that everyone from musicians to journalists seems to be utilizing. You might not like the idea that a website basically consisting of mere “status updates” is sweeping the nation, but Twitter is a fantastic way to stay in touch with all of your news.
Not so surprisingly, Twitter can be great for staying up to date with campus information. With a simple click of a button, you can receive instant updates on programming around campus, opportunities to get involved, Pete Carroll’s music taste and more. Following USC Annenberg (@USCAnnenberg) can keep you in the know about the various guest speakers the school brings to campus, as well as the school’s coverage in the media. Likewise, following USC Vitirbi (@USCVitirbi) gets you knowledge about the engineering school’s new programs, scholarships and events.
“It’s networking,” said Jamie Hoffman who works at USC’s Fisher Museum of Art (@FisherMuseum). “Especially with a museum, where we constantly have new programs going on, we try to advertise them and Twitter is just another way to publicize our events.”
Hoffman also points out that USC Twitter users can work together — though the Fisher Museum is not directly related with on-campus organizations such as Ground Zero, the two are following each other and would more than likely give a shout out or re-tweet the other if something caught their eye.
Twitter also helps the university itself just as well as it helps its organizations. USC has used Twitter to foster partnerships with other companies, such as the popular academic organization TED. Famous for broadcasting its conferences online, TED partnered with USC in 2009 to create TEDxUSC, an independently organized academic conference broadcasted globally. Attendees were encouraged to tweet their thoughts and ultimately, TEDxUSC racked up 2500 tweets, creating publicity for both the school and the program.
