The USC Trojans (11-18, 3-14 Pac-12) look to end the season on a high note when they travel across town to face the UCLA Bruins (18-12, 10-7) in the final game of the season. While USC will not be participating in the NCAA tournament later this month, a victory could be huge for the program and give the team momentum leading into the upcoming Pac-12 Tournament — even into the next season.
USC won their last home game of the season when they bested the Washington Huskies (15-13, 4-12) by a final score of 70-55. Sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic led the way with 16 points while freshman guard Elijah Stewart continued to shine in the absence of freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin, who was lost for the season with a shoulder injury, by scoring 14 points and grabbing nine rebounds. Redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt scored 11 points, and sophomore guard Julian Jacobs had a full stat line once again with 8 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. The win over Washington gave the Trojans their third conference win of the season, which is more than they had all of last season.
UCLA is coming off a win over the Washington State Cougars (12-16, 6-10) by a score of 72-67 to keep their tournament chances alive. Senior guard Norman Powell scored a       game-high 28 points. Junior forward Tony Parker came off the bench to contribute 15 points and 10 rebounds. Sophomore guard Bryce Alford and freshman forward Kevon Looney had 13 and 12 points respectively.
USC will try to play the role of spoiler against their rivals. If UCLA is able to take home the victory, they will have ended their season on a three-game winning streak. The strong ending to their season could give them a stronger case towards earning a berth in the tournament, but they still would not have a significant nonconference win under their belt. They lost to every ranked opponent they played during the year.
The last time these two teams squared off, the Bruins blew out the Trojans in the second half to secure the win. The Trojans fell to the Bruins 83-66 and they were out-rebounded by the crosstown rival 41-20. Jovanovic was the leading scorer for the Trojans the last time around with 20 points, but Powell and Alford shined for UCLA as they had 22 and 21 points respectively. The difference in the first meeting was the second half, during which UCLA shot 62.5 percent and extended the lead.
Jovanovic has been the most consistent player for USC this season although a big game against UCLA would help validate his skill set and give the young forward confidence heading into the off season ahead of next season.
“It was a big win because it’s a confidence boost,” Jovanovic said.
Jacobs has also shined in the absence of McLaughlin and has consistently been posting impressive stat lines. The captain of the squad has been near a triple double a couple of times, but it is his leadership on the court that has really made the difference. He has been more vocal in directing his teammates and calling plays. Jacobs knew that the win would be a huge boost heading into his junior year and was glad that he performed so well in front of the home crowd.
“We wanted to give them something to look forward to next year,” Jacobs said.
The game will be held at Pauley Pavilion and will tip off at 6 pm. The game will air on ESPN2.

After scoring the No. 3 recruiting class in the nation last month, head coach Steve Sarkisian and the Trojans kicked off spring practice Tuesday at Cromwell Field.
USC football faces a season with a lot of excitement thanks to a variety of factors. Five of the much discussed incoming players participated in their first college practice on Tuesday. Sarkisian is also entering his second season after his move from Washington, and senior quarterback Cody Kessler is one of the early season favorites for the Heisman Trophy. All of these factors have combined to generate hope, and some might say the expectation, for a championship season. Despite all the fanfare, however, the team remains focused.
“Honestly, I think [the expectations] are irrelevant,” Kessler said. “We’ve got a lot to work on, a lot to improve on and a long way to go to be where we want to be by the time we go into fall camp.”
Amid the buzz surrounding the start of spring football, it is easy to forget that USC does not have a game for another six months; Sarkisian stressed that no one on the team is looking that far ahead.
“The key for us is to focus on today,” he said. “How are we getting better today individually? How are we getting better today as a team, whether it is physically or mentally?”
Breaking Out of the Late-Game Funk
No one who followed USC last season has forgotten the two losses against Arizona and Utah last season, and neither have Sarkisian and the rest of the team. Tuesday’s practice ended with a simulation of the final two minutes of the game, and so will every other practice this spring. The first round went to the defense, which managed to shut down the Trojan offense three times in a row out of five.
“Who can we count on?” Sarkisian asked, issuing an early challenge to his team. “Who are going to be the guys who can make plays at those critical moments?”
Sarkisian noted that if USC had won those two games, they would have played for the Pac-12 Championship last season.
“You think about the ramifications, and of course we’re going to address [the late game struggles] and get better at it,” he said.
Replacing Buck Allen
Last year’s redshier junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen has left USC for the draft, and though junior Justin Davis had significant playing time last year and is Allen’s most logical replacement, Sarkisian is also keeping his eye on senior Tre Madden.
“I forgot how big and physical he is,” Sarkisian said. “He’s a physical runner. I think he and Justin complement each other really well because Justin has got such great speed and cutting ability, and Tre has such a hammer mentality … [and a] high football IQ with his quarterback background in high school and his ability to catch the ball.”
The New Guys
Five members of the 2015 recruiting class joined the team in time for spring practice: quarterback Ricky Town, linebacker Cameron Smith, offensive linemen Roy Hemsley and Chuma Edoga and wide receiver Issac Whitney, who is a junior college transfer. They made a positive impression on their captain and coach.
“The early enrollees and those who were freshmen last year came out today and really competed,” Kessler said.
Of course, not everything went right for the newcomers, but that much is to be expected from players competing in their first college practice. For now, Sarkisian was pleased with what he saw.
“They just kind of got into the flow of practice, which is about all you can expect them to do day one,” he said. “They flashed in some areas … then they had their moments when maybe they didn’t know the play as well as they would have liked. All in all, for the first college practice for those five guys, it went about as good as it could go.”
Quick Takes
Sophomore tight end Bryce Dixon was absent from practice due to a student conduct issue.
Senior linebacker Anthony Sarao was limited in practice with a foot injury. It is not serious, but the coaching staff decided to err on the side of caution.
Sarkisian singled out senior linebacker Lamar Dawson, saying that he looked like a “different player” after a great offseason conditioning program.
Redshirt sophomore Chris Hawkins, who is naturally a cornerback, spent a lot of time at safety. Sarkisian praised his football IQ and said that safety would best utilize his strengths.
After spending last season almost exclusively in the slot, redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell began to line up more often as an outside receiver, a pattern that Sarkisian said that they would continue to experiment with.

The year was 2009. Barack Obama had been sworn in as president about two months earlier. The iPhone didn’t have a built-in video camera feature yet. I forget whether I had joined Facebook yet.
But there’s one thing about that year I certainly won’t forget. USC men’s basketball won the Pac-10 Tournament that spring.
It seems like a distant memory, but it’s one any lifelong Trojan sports fan should certainly remember this week.
“It ain’t over ‘til it’s over,” is one of the oldest sports adages of all time. Whether you remember it as the quintessential Yogi Berra-ism or as Lenny Kravitz’s 1991 single, know that it is especially true in college basketball.
The phrase usually takes on a figurative term in sports — you still shouldn’t head to the exits yet, but I don’t think a basketball team can physically come back from a 30-point deficit with 15 seconds to play. At least for those in a traditional conference, however, a Division I NCAA basketball team’s season literally is not over until the team plays its final game.
The critique of NCAA basketball is that regular season play does not compare in excitement or significance to that of football. While true, NCAA football finally moved toward basketball this season by adding some sort of a postseason playoff, which proved to be just as awesome as everybody thought it would be.
But basketball still has a monopoly over the true Bill Murray Caddyshack Monologue Cinderella Story. Football has no shortages of upsets, but the unique two-tiered tournament style of the NCAA basketball playoffs is really the only system in organized American sports in which a team can go from worst to first in a mere couple of weeks.
That’s exactly the position the USC basketball team finds itself in, going into the final week of the regular season. The Trojans are dead last in the Pac-12 conference standings with a record of 3-14. Their overall record is a little better at 11-18, but out-of-conference play would have to get the Trojans above at least .500 for it to matter to the NCAA selection committee. The top team at Alpha Phi’s philanthropy basketball competition this weekend has about as good of a shot at getting an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as USC.
But with conference tournaments, the worst teams during the regular season can still automatically qualify for the NCAA tournament. While the winner of Phi Ball does not get an automatic bid to March Madness, the Pac-12 Tournament winner certainly does .
And every team automatically qualifies for the conference tournament, even the last-place Trojans. The team can hypothetically turn its season around by putting a couple good games together and winning the conference tournament.
By now, I should probably throw in a reality check, because the team’s chances at winning the tournament are only marginally better than getting an at-large bid. The Trojans would likely have to get past both   No. 5 Arizona and No. 13 Utah to win the Pac-12, and I would be shocked if the Trojans could pull out a miracle win against just one of those teams — let alone both.
The Trojans lost at Utah 79-55 then looked even worse when hosting the Utes, falling 67-39. The Trojans only had to play the Arizona once this year, and they also got the benefit of   home-court advantage in that one. But the Wildcats stomped the Trojans 87-57, the worst of the three losses that were all by at least 20 points.
The layout of the conference tournament actually plays to USC’s advantage quite a bit. Unlike the March Madness tournament in which the 16-seed has to face the 1-seed right out of the gate, the Trojans would only have to take down the 5-seed in the Pac-12 in the first round of the tournament. The top four seeds in the conference get a bye in the first round.
And rather than reseed the competition after every round so that the highest and lowest seeds always match up against each other — the NHL used to format its playoffs this way until last season — the Trojans would just have to play whomever is on their side of the bracket. The winner between the 5-seed and 12-seed plays the 4-seed in the second round, so the Trojans would hypothetically avoid both of the conference’s heavy hitters for the first two games.
The Trojans would likely have to go through 1-seeded Arizona in the semifinal then 2-seeded Utah in the final, but even that’s up in the air. Arizona will hit the winner of the 8-seed v. 9-seed game in its first game. Arizona State is currently tied for eighth place in the standings and is my guess for whom would play the Wildcats in the second round. Sure enough, one of Wildcats’ two in-conference losses this year was to their in-state rival, so an upset in that game is not out of the picture. Utah has four conference losses this season and could also slip up against one of the middle-of-the-pack teams before reaching the Pac-12 final.
And despite their record, the Trojans have actually looked competitive against the rest of the conference for the most part. With the exception of a trip to Colorado and a home game against UCLA, the Trojans have been within 10 points of every conference game and within five points of several occasions. The Trojans are one or two baskets away in many of these games, and they even won a trio.
The team might not look anything like the 2009 squad. It featured two current NBA players in DeMar DeRozan and Taj Gibson. The Trojans came in as the 6-seed and only had to battle nine other opponents before the conference expanded. It was Tim Floyd’s final year as the head coach of the team, as the NCAA discovered the program’s ascent to new heights was due at least partially to recruiting violations by Floyd.
But I haven’t forgotten that 2009 team, so I won’t forget to watch the Trojans try to save their season next week in the conference tournament. They face UCLA on Wednesday to close out the regular season, which hopefully gets them fired up for the final stretch.
If the Trojans do pull off the miracle and win an automatic tournament bid, I’d have to borrow another great Yogism: it’d be like deja vu all over again.

The Women of Troy will make the short trek across Los Angeles to face cross-town foe UCLA on Wednesday afternoon.  USC is currently sporting a   No. 3 national ranking to go along with their impressive 10-1 record.  UCLA, on the other hand, is ranked at No. 12 and has an 8-2 record thus far in the season.
The USC-UCLA rivalry is one of the most storied in the land, and many athletes have cited their rivalry games against UCLA as the highlights of their collegiate career.
“UCLA is definitely our biggest rival,” senior Sabrina Santamaria said.
As does every athletic team at USC, women’s tennis has unfinished business with their powder blue and gold counterparts.
USC has six players ranked individually in the nation; leading the way is junior Giuliana Olmos with a career-best ranking of No. 17.  UCLA also has six players ranked nationally with the highest two being Robin Anderson at No. 3 and Chanelle Van Nguyen at No. 7.
“UCLA is always a fun challenge because this is what makes college sports so fun,” said coach West Nott.  “We just try to put the blinders on and focus on what we can control, win or lose, and lay it all on the line mentally.”
Nott is happy with the way the team has been competing and cited “fine-tuning and the best mood to compete” as the main aspects they had focused on leading up to Wednesday’s match.
The two schools played three times in the regular season last year with the Bruins winning all three. After completing the season sweep, UCLA went on to win the NCAA national championship.  USC advanced to the third round where they fell to overall No. 1-seed Georgia.
In their quest to defend their title, UCLA will have to play one of the toughest conference and non-conference schedules in the nation.  USC has a similarly difficult schedule.
Eight of the 11 teams USC has played have been ranked in the top 30.  The other two are No. 41 St. Mary’s and No. 69 Denver.
Of the 10 matches UCLA has played this year, six have been against top-30 teams.
USC and UCLA have faced some similar competition thus far in the season.  The teams have overlapped opponents on four occasions leading up to Pac-12 play.  Both teams have defeated   St. Mary’s, Kentucky and Pepperdine in their respective meetings, twice for USC.  However, the big disparity comes in the two So Cal teams’ matches against fellow Pac-12 rival No. 5 Cal. UCLA, then ranked No. 4, fell at Cal 3-4.  The Women of Troy, ranked No. 11 at the time, were able to pull off the upset of Cal when they visited the Bay Area defeating them 4-3.
The Women of Troy have been streaking, having won their last six matches, as opposed to the Bruins who have been sinking in the rankings.  USC began their quest for a national title with a No. 14 rank.  They have steadily climbed the ranks, making pit stops at No. 12, No. 11 and           No. 4 on their way to their current ranking of No. 3.  UCLA’s season has been a completely opposite trend, with the defending champs opening the season at No. 1 before dropping to No. 4 following a loss to No. 9 Georgia and they’re currently No. 12 after the more recent loss to Cal.
The Women of Troy are looking forward to their rivalry match, but Nott has cautioned against overhyping the match.
“You try not to get too up or down, and just approach it like you always would,” Nott said.  “Everyday we are trying to do our best in practice or competing, so it is another day where you challenge yourself to your standards.”
The Trojans will certainly be given a chance to challenge themselves and see their hard work pay dividends in the fight for L.A.
Wednesday’s match will be the second to last for USC before conference play.  The UCLA match will air on the Pac-12 Network at 1:30 pm.

The USC College Republicans hosted speaker Michelle Park Steel, a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors and USC alumna Tuesday evening at their meeting.
Steel is a former member of the California State Board of Equalization in which she became the highest-ranked Korean-American in national politics. She also worked on the California World Trade Commission, the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services, the Los Angeles Airport and Fire Commissions and the President’s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders under former President George W. Bush.
“We are very excited to have Ms. Steel,” said Jacob Ellenhorn, director of public relations for the USC College Republicans. “She has a very interesting story and she is a very strong voice within the Republican Party. Having her as a minority in her elected position really shows that the party is a diverse one.”
The session was moderated by USC College Republican President Alex Kludjian. Steel spoke about her background, graduate work at USC and political work before opening up the floor to questions.
Steel described her journey into politics as a personal one. After her husband, Shawn Steel, former chairman of the California Republican Party, chose not to run for the Board of Equalization, Steel decided to run. Her childhood as a hard-working, first-generation American is partially why the position was so appealing to her.
“I’m a first-generation [American], and my dream was to be a housewife,” Steel said. “Most first generations work for 14 to 16 hours per day and that was exactly what I did after school every day. When my mom closed down the clothing shop to open a sandwich shop to work less hours, the Board of Equalization hit her with taxes, plus interest that she didn’t owe.”
After Steel was elected to the Board of Equalization in 2006, she described the learning curve as a stiff one.
“It took eight years to abolish the bad tax policy, but I finally did it,” Steel said. “We returned to the taxpayers over $400 million.”
Steel responded to questions from the College Republicans about the future of the Republican Party, and its role in getting Republican voters, particularly in California, to the polls.
“The Republican Party has to embrace more viewpoints and people,” Steel said. “You can’t cut everyone off. Not all Republicans have to agree on everything. We have to have a bigger umbrella.”
Students responded to how Steel’s political experience in Orange County can be applicable to national politics.
“I think Supervisor Steel gave us a very interesting perspective on Orange County politics and how that translates into national politics and pushing the Republican Party forward,” said Michael Flores, a sophomore majoring in political science.
Eric Dubbury, executive director of the USC College Republicans, spoke about his work with Steel on her campaign for Orange County Supervisor.
“Michelle is someone in the Republican Party who is very moderate, who has a lot of objectivity to her goals and who was running a really non-partisan position,” Dubbery said. “She represents someone in a different ethnic community, really involved in just a different political position that can really show value to areas of politics that aren’t partisan camps. Her position in politics is very valuable for the community.”

At the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting Tuesday night, Rahul Madduluri, a junior majoring in computer engineering, and Suvil Deora, a PhD candidate in electrical engineering, announced the development of SafeNet, an upcoming system of theft detection and assault prevention developed at USC.
“[SafeNet] will help people trace their belongings and protect them from assault,” Deora said. “This technology takes the form of small wearables. You can put them in your backpack, in your bike or [on your body].”
Deora then walked the student senators through a hypothetical theft and the SafeNet response.
“Once you park your bike you will get a notification, which means your bike has been electronically locked,” Deora said. “The system then activates as soon as your bike is moved, but it won’t send an alarm to DPS unless it moves more than 10 meters. If that happens, it will send a notification to your phone, but there’s also a setting in the app that contacts DPS right away.”
Maddulari expressed how SafeNet will be simple in implementation and low in price.
“The student pays $15 and puts [SafeNet] on their bike or on [himself or herself],” Rahul said. “Then, someone with a wearable  [device] can press one button, and as soon he or she is in trouble [DPS] will know where he or she is. It’s pretty simple.”
Deora explained the logistics behind the technology, which requires a tight network of station bases around campus.
“We plant to implement a network around USC that allows DPS to track devices around when they are turned on or when a student is in a distress[ing] situation. There will be base stations on every block connected in a cell network,” Deora said. “With the technology you will be able to actually tell … which floor or which corner you are. Things can be tracked to specific places. That is the beauty of the technology.”
Madduluri then enumerated the benefits of SafeNet against other market competitors.
“The best part of [SafeNet] is that you don’t need Wi-Fi, no cell reception and no data cost. You buy this $15 device and that’s it,” Madduluri said. “They are also tamper-proof. If someone tried to break the wearables, we will still get a notification.”
Following a request from senators, Deora gave a figure for the cost of starting the system.
“The cost will depend on how much area the university plans to cover, but it will come to be at $300,000 for a start,” Deora said. “However, after that point, we’re only looking at $7000 for each square mile block of coverage you add. Once that is in place, everything will be cheap afterwards.”
Deora said that he and Madduluri saw a need on campus and responded to it.
“I’ve seen a lot of crime around campus,” Deora said. “Because this had been bothering students and the administration a lot, we asked if we could use the technology outside of the classroom.”
Senators also asked Deora for a possible timeline for implementation.
“Our first shipment of wearable devices comes next week. We will tweak them and get them working in a month’s time,” Deora said. “During the first part of the project, devices are to be handed [out] for free, which will be provided for in the original budget. Once people see this working, they will then start investing. And most parents would like their kids to wear this device.”
Madduluri attributed the source of his motivation for working on SafeNet to personal experience.
“The shooting [at] the Black Alumni Association [event] in the middle of campus happened my freshman year, and one of my best friends was 10 feet away from the shooter,” Madduluri said. “This struck pretty close to home, and I knew this was something I felt a passion for. Students prefer to have false alarms than to have those real arrests and thefts.”
Deora also discussed his motivations for working on the project.
“I started working on a localization project as part of my PhD. My electrical engineering professor [Bhaksar Krishnamachari] said we should think of taking this outside the lab. We had thought of similar applications in 2012, but there had been too many hurdles, and we’re finally here,” Deora said. “This technology was invented here at USC; we have been working on it and we want to use it.”

In January 2013, Alexis Cotton, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, co-founded a national student organization called Motivate and Empower that aims to inspire positive leadership movements on college campuses by serving as a catalyst and support network for student action.
“M&E created an outreach program for students to tutor, mentor and spend time with L.A. youth. We also conduct events to discuss social issues relevant to our campus,” Cotton said. “Currently, we are in the midst of bringing A-list rappers to USC for a concert addressing racial profiling and police brutality.”
Not only is Cotton passionate about her designs and creations, but she also utilizes her skills to give back to the USC community and the surrounding neighborhood. As a talented graphic designer, Cotton dedicates a majority of her time to Motivate and Empower, where she serves as vice president of marketing and creative direction.
She talks with passion about the beginnings of the project.
“My roommate founded the organization after seeing the lack of community and communication among USC students, as well as the stereotypes and social issue that segregated the student body. We wanted to create a diverse space for people to discuss social issues, start initiative and volunteer together.”
Motivate and Empower has lofty goals in mind, but Cotton seemed unfazed by the future challenges.
“It is great to see that our presence at USC and our eight other campuses nationwide are sparking ripples of positive change,” she said. “My favorite part is watching other students get inspired by M&E to start their own initiatives and get involved on campus. I love being able to see that we are sparking ripples of positive change.”
Cotton has noted how actively participating in Motive and Empower has helped her develop skills that will be useful in her future career path in marketing or advertising. As an extremely passionate student about social issues and change, Cotton is outspoken about the responsibility and power that design can impart on society.
“As I work with Motivate and Empower, I am understanding the power of celebrity influence. Positive celebrity representation has the potential to buffer against the influx of media and societal racism that is perpetuating devastating internalized oppression into our modern society.” Cotton said. “A career as a creative director within the entertainment industry will allow me the ability to work with musical artists to positively declare what is hip, popular and beautiful. I will have a platform to use marketing strategies and my creative license to enact social change.”
Even before attending USC, Cotton has been passionate about pursuing her creative strengths in higher education. She attended a major arts high school in New York City, the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, at which the curriculum covers a wide array of arts such as dance, voice, instrumental music, fine arts, drama and film. Cotton’s high school experience was out of the ordinary, but it cultivated a foundation where Cotton could explore her passions, while providing a viable route for success in the working world of creative industries.
“It is very similar to the movie Fame where students apply to the programs,” Cotton said “I had to complete a portfolio and a series of essays in order to be considered for the school. I enrolled in two art classes of varying mediums each semester. It wasn’t until I took a graphic design course in junior year did I realize that I wanted to pursue a degree in graphic design.”
In the classroom, Cotton enjoys the same freedom that she enjoyed in high school. The Roski School of Art and Design offers similar course personalization for students.
“I love the freedom that Roski provides students in terms of their course choices. In contrast to arts colleges, you do not have to declare a single emphasis and can study across all disciplines if you decide to. In addition, for the majority of courses there are multiple professors to choose from,” Cotton said.
Cotton, harbors massive goals for her future. Her career path is not one that is based on profit, but of making the world a better place. She said that her favorite aspect of design is being able to take what she has learned in her courses and translate it into real world application.
“I view design and advertising as a catalyst for social change. Through an artistic lens I can showcase the ethnic diversity of our society, helping people visually appreciate unique representations of beauty, success, and fulfillment,” Cotton said.

If you’ve listened to the radio at all in the last few years, you’ve probably heard the names Diplo and Skrillex. The two DJs are among the most influential artists in their genre, with a slew of accomplishments, and their collaborative project, Jack Ü, furthers their influence in electronic dance music. Their first album as Jack Ü is self-titled; Diplo and Skrillex blend their unique styles beautifully to create tracks worthy of clubs around the world.
Skrillex has been at the top of EDM since his second release, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, and has influenced the popularity of the rave scene. Though he hasn’t been at the top of the charts in a while, his six Grammys are a testament to his strength and holding in the EDM genre. Skrillex is arguably the first exclusively EDM artist to get radio play, as his predecessors such as David Guetta and Swedish House Mafia provided pop songs with techno backbeats — much unlike the mechanical sound Skrillex has manufactured. His partner in Jack Ü, Diplo, is also accomplished but in a different respect.
Diplo, born Thomas Pentz, is the backbone of EDM music today. In addition to his own career as a musician, he owns and manages a major dance music label, Mad Decent, which has a traveling festival every year that features artists such as Deadmau5, RiFF RAFF and other high-profile musicians. He also has several side projects in dance music, including his reggae-inspired dance hall project Major Lazer — possibly more recognized than his own name. Diplo has been described as a head-hunter who seeks new talent in the industry. He has created a dance music empire, and he’s at the top. With this impressive experience in producing dance music, Diplo’s partnership with Skrillex is a sure-fire success.
Released during a 24-hour DJ set in Los Angeles (home for both artists), the fun and light album Diplo and Skrillex have created contains traces of both artists. The production talent and features are distinctly Diplo, and the light builds and mechanical drops are signatures of Skrillex. Considering this album is a free Soundcloud release, the features are pretty impressive. Justin Bieber, 2 Chainz, Kiesza and even the highly established Missy Elliott all lend their talents to the work, giving this album some high profile energy despite the small release.
Only one track from Jack Ü was released before the album dropped. “Take U There,” featuring Kiesza, was released months prior at the Mad Decent Block Party in August. The song marked the official launch of Jack Ü, and helped boost Kiesza’s popularity as a dance house singer. Ever since, fans have been waiting for more tracks to drop. Now on their album, Jack Ü not only give fans plenty more tracks to blast at parties, but release an alternate version of “Take U There” with a hot verse by Missy Elliott.
“Take U There,” in traditional Soundcloud fashion, was remixed by countless artists, but Missy Elliott’s version was the only one to make the album, because her verse is incredibly solid, and because she’s Missy Elliott. As the most accomplished artist on the album, Missy Elliot’s bonus track adds great publicity to an already much-hyped album.
Dance music is completely different from almost any other genre, as most EDM artists release their work freely to be remixed. This allows other DJs to gain fame and creates a collaborative environment for artists to thrive, and, as aforementioned, Diplo is the godfather of collaboration. A playlist of remixes of “Take U There” was released on Jack Ü’s Soundcloud page as well, highlighting the artists that did justice to the already impressive track, and it would be assumed that more playlists will come out featuring remixes of other tracks on Jack U, because that is the atmosphere Diplo has created with his work.
Aside from Missy Elliott’s bonus track, Justin Bieber’s feature track closes the album on a softer note. Entitled “Where Are U Now,” the track features Bieber singing slowly over only synths and piano, without a beat until the drop. The track still has the main aspects of an EDM song, but takes a slow, love song approach that is an appropriate denouement to a slew of high intensity hits.
Overall, Jack Ü’s first release is a tour-de-force in production, content and collaboration. The features are solid, the backing tracks are better and the fact that two of America’s three biggest offerings in the EDM genre (the third being A-trak) created it together is a sign of things to come. America has traditionally been left behind in EDM music, as Europe accepted the genre long before it took hold in the states, but these two artists are helping to carve out a path for American success. Diplo and Skrillex are two artists who love to have fun, and their collaboration truly reflects that. If you’re looking for an album to dance to, look no further than Jack Ü.

Students are in a rut. They are all in that midterm stupor, with the failed attempts at spring break dieting, living with overcast L.A. skies and blank Word documents. So there is no better time to stay in bed and forgo all obligations. Yet, instead of wasting precious procrastination hours searching YouTube, Netflix has announced an exciting lineup of newly release spring shows perfect for binge-watching or “multi-tasking” while writing that essay.
The most publicized released was season three of House of Cards. Frank and Claire Underwood are set to take on the world in this new season. The season boasts 13 episodes of political manipulation on Capitol Hill.
The series as a whole was met with wide acclaim and positive reviews, but many students have felt let down by the most recent season.
“As a huge House of Cards fan, I’ve been pretty underwhelmed by this season,” said Kiren Singh, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “It seems to be plagued by inconsequential subplots that aren’t half as clever or useful as the ones in previous seasons. Frank also doesn’t break the fourth wall nearly as much as he did in the first or second season.”
Her complaints over the new season didn’t stop there, however.
“It’s also less fun to watch because in the first two seasons, Frank was super manipulative and cunning. This season, he’s literally just doing whatever he pleases in a very controlling and sometimes in an overly emotional way. It seems more like a season to set up season four than a stand-alone.”
Many viewers would agree. This season of House of Cards was met with critically mixed reviews. The show is much less hyperbolic and dramatic, less “fun.”
Viewers find it difficult to see the future goal of the show as a whole.
“I thought the cinematography was great but the story was literally not moving forward,” said Jenny Morgan, an undeclared sophomore. “We were just watching that guy do his physical therapy for the first 20 minutes.”
Yet House of Cards’ fans will still enjoy the usual political drama behind closed doors, the witty and intellectual dialogue and the usual drama that surrounds the manipulative and secretive Underwoods. There are still some that enjoy the general narrative of the show.
“I’d say the first season was the best and it’s gotten progressively more unrealistic,” Tyler Jew, a senior majoring in business positively said. “Nonetheless it’s still a really entertaining show.
In the less dramatic genre of original series, Netflix will also be releasing a comedy original series. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt will be released on March 6. Tina Fey is the executive producer and creator of this unique comedy, which stars Ellie Kemper, Jane Krakowski and Tituss Burgess. The story follows a young woman, Kimmy Schmidt, who breaks out of her cult’s underground bunker in Indiana after 15 years and decides to nanny for an rich woman in New York City. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is is a show with charm promisingly similar to that of Parks and Recreation and 30 Rock. Another original Netflix series includes, Bloodline, a thriller-drama show that will debut on Netflix on March 20.
The show takes place in the Florida Keys and features Kyle Chandler, former Friday Night Lights star. The storyline centers around the revelation of family secrets, coupled with the possible violent consequences of a long time family feud. This show could easily become a new favorite and one that one feels compelled to binge-watch.
Netflix will also be releasing non-original movies and shows to their streaming platform. TV shows include season seven of Mad Men in late March and season one of Better Call Saul in mid-April. Additionally, Netflix is planning to release comedy stand up shows. Aziz Ansari’s newest comedy spotlight, “Aziz Ansari: Live at Madison Square Garden” will be released March 6.
Newly released spring 2015 movies that will be streaming on Netflix, will come from a wide variety of genres.
Food Chains is a documentary that follows the struggles of America’s own food workers. According to the website, the movie “reveals the human cost in our food supply and the complicity of large buyers of produce like fast food and supermarkets.” Former Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria is one of the executive producers of this documentary.
A more light-hearted, family-friendly movie is How to Train Your Dragon 2. Teen Witch, a 1980’s cult classic, was available starting March 1.
Yet, if none of these spring releases seem that appealing, A new season of Orange is the New Black will be released on June 12 so there is just enough time to re-watch seasons one and two at least a few times.
Correction: Kiren Singh was previously referred to as a “he.” She is a woman. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Great content coming to Netflix. I got access to more Netflix content. Luckily I found the instructions at PureVPN. Which explain exactly how to change my Netflix region

Giraffage, born Charlie Yin, is an EDM producer based in San Francisco and signed to Fool’s Gold Records. His newest EP No Reason was released in November of 2014, and consists of only 5 songs. But those 5 songs are no “Fool’s Gold.” It’s the real stuff. His musical style emits a sort of psychedelic, fantasy feeling of both calm and excitement at the same time. This past weekend at the El Rey Theatre was an emotional one as Giraffage ended his No Reason North America tour with a sold-out show.
Los Angeles DJs starRo and Spazzkid opened with atmospheric, ambient house music, building up energy and setting the stage for what was to come. Giraffage casually made his way up the aisles of the audience to follow Spazzkid’s invigorating performance. At the sound of the roaring auditorium, Giraffage began his one hour set. He dropped his most popular hits, including “Tell Me” (a personal favorite) and some of his most unorthodox remixes such as Baha Men’s “Who Let the Dogs Out.” And if anybody can pull off a remix of Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA,” Giraffage is the man.
He gave shout-outs throughout the show to the different DJs’ songs he was remixing. It was a nice act of acknowledgement, and garnered cheers for each of the pieces he dropped. This included a shout-out to his good friend Porter Robinson when he played “Lionhearted.” In fact, the show echoed his opening on the Porter Robinson “Worlds” tour. Porter Robinson’s unconventional show with live instruments, storytelling and jaw-dropping visuals definitely helped influence Giraffage to set himself apart from other DJs.
Instead of the the heavy bass drops everyone is uses to in EDM, Giraffage’s drops consist of calm, smooth tones. One of his first opening songs from No Reason features the sound of synthesized water droplets and fluid piano tones. What stood out in particular was his remix of R. Kelly’s “Ignition,” combining his dreampop style with rap. He also managed to turn the all-so-popular iPhone default ringtone into a piece very much enjoyed by his fans.
Around the auditorium, fans rocked slowly back and forth, jumped up and down and stood in a complete trance state enjoying his music. It was an incredible ending to an incredible tour, but it just marks the beginning of a brilliant career.

A manhunt ensued near USC’s University Park campus Tuesday night, concluding with two armed suspects being taken into custody.
At approximately 6:30 p.m., LAPD officers were in the process of arresting two armed men near Ralphs supermarket on Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue during a traffic stop when the suspects discarded their weapons and fled on foot.
During the attempted arrest, one suspect who attempted to flee was immediately caught and the other fled away from the scene to the neighborhood of Ellendale Place, a heavily populated student residential area, according to DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle. LAPD helicopters and K-9 unit also arrived on the scene to assist officers with the search for the suspect.
The suspect was later located behind an apartment complex on 2659 Ellendale Pl.
LAPD officers declined to disclose the names of the suspects involved and halted oncoming traffic in the area surrounding Ellendale Place and Vermont Avenue.
Austin Chanu, a senior majoring in music composition, was studying with his roommate in the apartment complex when the suspect was apprehended.
“We noticed there were three cop cars outside our apartment on the street,” he said. “They had the beam lights pointed toward our apartment.”
Chanu said that LAPD entered the building shortly after with K-9 units and apprehended the suspect in the back of the complex where he was hiding.
“Five minutes later, two of the cops came out with the suspect apprehended,” he said.
DPS sent out a Trojan Alert at approximately 6:52 p.m. warning students of the ongoing police activity and asking them to stay clear of the area.
At 8:05 p.m., a Trojan Alert was sent out stating that the incident was resolved and the area is safe.
LAPD took the suspect into custody at approximately 7:37 p.m. | Mariya Dondonyan

I don’t understand Ras5555’s point. USC, like a number of other big private universities in NYC, Philadelphia, Chicago and elsewhere, was built in a nice neighborhood that became slums decades later. That is regrettable, but it is a workable situation that urban students learn to live with.. Ras5555 could have gone to one of many fine colleges in pastoral surroundings. Perhaps he can still transfer.
Even though these suspect fled in an area where many USC students live, since it was technically off campus and these gun-toting thugs are not USC students, I am sure USC will say this is a non-USC related incident. As if flying bullets will automatically veer away from people possessing an USC ID.

On Feb. 16, the Education Committee of the Oklahoma House voted 11-4 in favor of a bill that could potentially defund the Advanced Placement United States History program in Oklahoma public schools. Republican Rep. Dan Fisher, the bill’s author, declared his proposal to be an “emergency” bill on grounds that the new APUSH curriculum’s “emphasis of instruction is on America as a nation of oppressors and exploiters.”
Fisher garnered support from former history teacher Larry Krieger, who asserted in hearings about the bill that the new framework does not highlight “American exceptionalism” as it should, a sentiment echoed by other Republican legislators. Fisher and his cohorts wrote up a new curriculum that underscores the “positive aspects” of American history. It includes speeches from Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as required reading, but no speeches from any Democratic president after Lyndon B. Johnson.
There is great irony to be found in all of this. Fisher and his supporters are trying to boost patriotism in the American classroom in the most unpatriotic way — by denying history. The new APUSH framework is a step in the right direction for history education in this country. It adds substance to a diluted view of American history that has a propensity for glossing over the blemishes of our nation’s past. Georgia Sen. William Ligon chastised the curriculum for looking at America “through the lens of gender, race and class identity.” But this type of perspective is precisely what has been sorely missing in history courses. American history should be taught not through a confocal lens but rather through a multiplicity of voices.
The duty of an American history curriculum is not to promote American exceptionalism — it is to give a truthful depiction of our past in a way that informs our decisions as citizens in the future. In fact, an attempt by the government to gut out the uncomfortable truths of our history compromises American exceptionalism, if there is any. To be truly exceptional, we must show, not tell. A nation that is able to confront and have a dynamic discussion about mistakes and thorny events in its past is one that is less likely to make those mistakes again.
Fisher and his fellow Republicans, however, treat education as a political football, marrying partisan agenda with classroom study. Granted, this is not a practice exclusive to Republican politicians, but rarely is an agenda so blatantly obvious and potentially harmful.
This is not an incident isolated to Oklahoma; Georgia, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and North Carolina have all proposed anti-APUSH measures as well. Republican opposition to the curriculum transcended the state level when the Republican National Committee, inspired by an open letter from Larry Krieger and activist Jane Robbins, resolved to label the new framework as “radically revisionist.”
This is reflective of a perpetually growing trend of anti-intellectualism in the Republican Party. Republicans are, with more vigor than ever, engaging in a denial campaign — denial of our history, denial of evolution, denial of man’s effect on the climate, denial of vaccine science, to name a few. Misguided rhetoric is not only being spewed by extremely conservative state representatives,  but it’s also being touted by 2016 presidential contenders as well. For example, Gov. Scott Walker recently declined to answer questions about evolution at a recent appearance in Britain; Ben Carson, another 2016 favorite, said that the new APUSH curriculum would have most kids “ready to go sign up for ISIS,” and Sen. Rand Paul, in an interview with CNBC, initially praised the development of vaccines, but then went on the make the widely disproven claim that vaccines could be linked to mental disorders in children.  These types of comments recklessly spread misinformation and damage the Republican image.
Along with this disavowal of the truth has come a weakening of the party’s moderate voice. In the last two presidential elections, the GOP forced two right-of-center candidates to the far right; and after both defeats, party leaders and figureheads such as Karl Rove cried out that Republicans were unsuccessful because the candidates were not conservative enough. And so the once fringe right-wing of the GOP has become the new mainstream.
Dan Fisher’s proposal has received a considerable amount of backlash since its conception, and Fisher is now scrambling to revise the bill. If the GOP wants self-preservation, it’ll scramble to revise its own platform before the 2016 elections.

Fifty Shades of Grey aside, the biggest gender-related film in the news this week was The Hunting Ground, the 2014 Sundance documentary that hit theaters in Los Angeles and New York City this past Friday. The Hunting Ground, which provides firsthand accounts of campus sexual assaults and their mishandlings at universities across the nation, has already been screened at the nation’s capitol and will premiere in Washington, Boston and Berkeley theaters on March 13.
Not only is this film important overall as a cinematic culmination of recent efforts to combat campus sexual assault, but The Hunting Ground is also important in of itself. It is a tangible form of resistance produced by independent filmmakers, launched into the public eye after its premiere at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In other words, this is not some low-budget project produced by an activist organization — this is a professional film garnering serious critical attention. The widespread success of this documentary so far marks The Hunting Ground as a major turning point in the war on sexual assault. It is a full-fledged attack on rape culture at its most pervasive source — the media.
By “rape culture,” I mean that we live in a society that implicitly enables unbridled hyper-masculinity and degrades everyone who doesn’t satisfy that requirement. This isn’t to say that America openly promotes sexual assault; as Shannon Ridgway of Everyday Feminism explains, “We’re talking about cultural practices … that excuse or otherwise tolerate sexual violence.”  Ridgway goes on to list 25 examples of rape culture in today’s society, including misogynistic song lyrics, sexist chants, rape jokes, offensive memes and several unjust court rulings for cases of sexual assault. The “cultural practices,” however, responsible for promoting rape culture well exceed 25 recent incidents. Major industries such as advertising, film, television and publishing are key in perpetuating the normativity of sexual assault in the U.S.
If you’re still skeptical as to how much cultural products can affect a population’s outlook on sex, take a look at the hype surrounding Fifty Shades of Grey. Real-life BDSM communities advocate safety, communication and trust above all else. The book and cinematic adaptations of Fifty Shades, however, paint a much different picture of kink, raising questions of what happens to a society when it cannot discern between unorthodox consensual intercourse and sexual assault.
Author Emma Green confronts this issue in The Atlantic. Green opens with a meditation on fantasy, asserting that “[i]n culture, fantasy works like a mirror: It reflects who we are, but it also shapes what we become.” Bearing this in mind, the national obsession with Fifty Shades of Grey is disconcerting; the main character’s narration reveals frequent discomfort with the violent sexual behaviors practiced by her partner, but she plummets into a cesspool of miscommunication and forced sexual submission. In spite of the harrowing undertones of Fifty Shades of Grey, American audiences have widely embraced the novel and the disturbing image it paints of romance. In the words of Green, “This is a troubling fantasy in American culture, where one in five women will be raped within their lifetime … and where troubling evidence of casual attitudes toward rape … is not uncommon.” It’s especially disturbing that the same nation claiming to embrace the movement against campus sexual assault is consuming this story so voraciously. In other words, a powerful cultural product is drowning out the harrowing testimonies of victims and the hard work of activists.
Of course, if cultural products promote rape culture, they can also be an answer to combating that same culture . An article for The Nation asserts that “[r]ape culture exists because we don’t believe it does.” Not only does The Hunting Ground shatter this foundation of “rape culture,” but its message is packaged in a familiar, consumable format. The Washington Post cited the words of Annie E. Clark, a rape survivor featured in the film:
“We hope it breaks that fourth wall, so it’s not kept within the echo chamber of survivors and higher education and feminist blogs … While those are all great, we just hope the public sees this. You know, your average person sitting down to eat dinner at six o’clock in Kansas.”
Hopefully, Clark’s wishes will come to fruition, and The Hunting Ground’s effect will be far more immediate than the slow, subliminal embedding of misogyny. One thing is for certain — given its success, The Hunting Ground is a major step in bringing this issue to the mainstream light, and that’s a step in the right direction.

This weekend was our first time out of Amman, far from the blaring car horns and endless dust that define our everyday lives in the city. We traveled about three hours south to Wadi Rum, Jordan’s famous, immense desert and the a film site in Lawrence of Arabia.
Think flat, red sand for as far as you can see, the landscape punctuated by unreal rock formations and rolling sand dunes. I felt as if I were in the film too, as my primary mode of transportation that day was my very own camel that I lovingly named Paul. We clueless college kids probably formed the funniest camel caravan our Bedouin tour guides had ever seen, bouncing around in the desert, laughing when our camels tried to go astray and taking endless selfies.
Riding a camel is a lot like riding a horse, except you’re up about twice as high and go about half as fast. Paul took me deep into Wadi Rum, where we then loaded into 4×4 trucks and zoomed around the desert at higher speeds than the camels’ relaxed trot. We were shown ancient cave drawings, Bedouin camps, and incredible vistas, stopping at the biggest sand dune I’ve ever seen that took about twenty minutes to climb up.
The view from the top was worth it though, and I sat and watched the sunset before running down the hill at speeds I’ll probably never reach again, always on the brink of losing control of my own feet and toppling down the hill headfirst. We drove back to the camp as night fell, and were greeted with absolutely incredible Arab meal of kebabs, pita, and hummus by our Bedouin hosts. After dinner, they tried to teach us a traditional dance that seemed like a combination of the Electric Slide and a conga line, though I was absolutely hopeless at it. It was exactly what you’d think of when you imagined the perfect day in the desert, and couldn’t have been a better first weekend trip out in Jordan!

“World’s Famous Hot Pastrami” towers over the corner of Alvarado and 7th St. next to Los Angeles’ renowned MacArthur Park. At Langer’s Deli, it is the truth. Beef reigns king in this part of town while pastrami is the poster-boy at this 68 year-old iconic delicatessen. At Langer’s, they don’t just make a sandwich; they create a colossal phenomenon of hot pastrami and coleslaw all packed in between two slices of delicious Russian rye bread. The sandwich is absolutely incredible and coupled with a fitting deli-style pickle, you’ll wonder why the place closes so early.
I’ve tried a variety of food at many restaurants and cafes in L.A. In a place like this, you have to branch out and try to see it all. From posh Westside eateries with delightful delicacies to hole-in-the-wall joints in Downtown with amazing food, by and large my personal favorite is Langer’s Deli. It’s a classic. It’s the West Coast’s Katz, but better. It attracts people from all walks of life. Be it 9-5-ers, professional athletes, corporate executives, students, elderly, locals or tourists, everyone knows Langer’s and it never ceases to satisfy.
When you walk in the deli, you become ensconced to the fullest extent in the spirit of the city of angels. The old-fashioned, brown leather booths, the classic counter in front of the kitchen and the incredibly generous wait staff make Langer’s the No.1 lunch spot in L.A.
They have a large menu, but make a B-line for the No.19. It’s what they’re known for and it’s what makes Langer’s unique. It is a bit expensive, but you can’t put a price on the experience you’ll have. If you’re an L.A. native and haven’t been to Langer’s, the time is now to make your pilgrimage. If you’re not from L.A., pay a trip to Langer’s and you’ll be able to tell your friends and family back home you had a famous No.19 sandwich from Langer’s Deli.
Langer’s isn’t too far from campus, you can take the 10-minute drive either with your own car or Uber. They close at 4 p.m. and aren’t open on Sundays, but the next time you have an opportunity to go out for lunch during the week, consider the home of the famous No.19.

The Department of Justice announced Tuesday that former CIA Director and Price School of Public Policy Judge Widney Professor David Petraeus will plead guilty to providing his then mistress, Paula Broadwell, with classified information in 2011.
Petraeus stated that he had given Broadwell, his biographer, access to eight “black books” that contained classified information regarding issues of national security, codes and the information as to the identities of various undercover agents and employees.
Petraeus’ guilty plea is part of a plea deal he struck with the Department of Justice in which he will only plead guilty to a single count of retaining classified information. This will allow the retired four-star army general to sidestep charges of obstruction of justice and lying to the FBI, which hold more serious punishments. The Department of Justice announced they would recommend probation for Petraeus.
The investigation into the leaked information began back in 2012 when the FBI received a complaint from Jill Kelley, a friend and colleague of Petraeus’ claiming to be receiving threatening emails from an unknown source that appeared to be an attempt to blackmail the CIA director.
The FBI determined Broadwell to be the source of the harassing emails and found evidence of the Broadwell Petraeus affair. Petraeus stepped down from his position as CIA director in 2012 after news of his affair with Broadwell went public.
When the FBI called Broadwell in for questioning on the investigation, she informed them that Petraeus had given her access to classified information during a four-day window, which they later confirmed after finding evidence of the leaked information on her computer. Prior to his resignation, the FBI called Petraeus in for questioning where he lied to agents, claiming he had never given out classified information.
In April 2013, the FBI retrieved the black books Broadwell referenced from Petraeus’ home, and the retired general signed the plea deal on Feb. 22.
Petraeus came to USC in October 2013, focusing his lectures to students on how energy technology and life science innovations will help to grow and improve the North American economy.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the university has not responded to requests for comment.
Also a faculty advisor for the USC Veterans Association, Petraeus has said that one of the draws to USC for him was the value the university places on service members.
“USC is in the middle of a surge,” Petraeus said at an October 2012 lunch with the Veterans Association. “USC has a great faculty, great students and the weather’s fantastic. It’s hard to beat.”

This sentence is false.
If the preceding statement is true, then it is false, and if it is false, then it is true. The paradox is a twist of logic and language that contradicts itself, ultimately rendering itself meaningless. For the aspiring philosophy major, the statement is a reminder of just how easy it is to talk oneself into a corner when using too many words, especially in the discussion of big ideas. But for the average Trojan, the irrelevant paradox also reveals the disconnect between language and meaning, highlighting the shortcomings of language to truly encompass our experiences at all.
It’s a detachment easily seen when we, for example, talk to our friends back home about our experiences at college. There’s often too much to say and no way to properly express it, and without them here to experience what we explain, the explanation falls short of actually understanding the complex occurrences and relationships that persist.
And never mind the complex emotions — language will never fully incorporate the emotions of love or loss or regret, though centuries of poetry and literature and songwriting have attempted to do so. Each new attempt, however, requires something different than the last, a new and creative way to string together the hundreds of thousands of words in the English language in a way that strikes a new chord with human experience. And it’s the desire for novelty that is troubling, because it suggests we haven’t found something that actually depicts the meaning of humanity.
The problem of incomplete depiction can also be extended to the use of artistic mediums for documentation. Documentaries aimed to chronicle historical events, for example, while informative, may not be informative enough if the goal is to foster a replication of the event that actually took place. Bias appears from all angles — from pieces selected to appear and subjects’ actions and words. Granted, perhaps it is the artist’s biased interpretation of the world perhaps that creates the their unique perspective. But it is a mistake to consider that an accurate portrait of actual events.
Nevertheless, it’s worth mentioning that the rise of constant documentation — given by the popularity of the selfie, the rise of Snapchat and the trend of perpetual photography — allows us a certain legitimacy to documentation that has not always existed. And perhaps we will continue to bridge the gap between what we experience and what we express. Until then, we must accept an imperfect system for what it is, and, like all things in life, create art with its imperfections.

Jordyn Holman | Daily Trojan
In many ways, Oxford is the USC of England.
For any Trojan that has spent at least a semester at USC, I’m sure seeing a few cameras, big lights and several celebrities sprinkled around campus is not an uncommon sight. Most recently, the action film Taken 3 was shot on campus. As for TV, this fall, many students witnessed Viola Davis from How To Get Away With Murder filming a scene for ABC’s hit show.
In the same way, Oxford has been home to not only many films — cough, cough “Harry Potter” — but also served as the inspiration for many novelists. So this weekend, I trekked my way to see the famed city and the consortium of 38 colleges.
I spent most of my time on a walking tour learning about all the hidden gems the city held. Other than the famed Harry Potter series that were partially filmed in Oxford, Saving Private Ryan and 2013’s Belle came alive on the campus. The distinctive architecture makes Oxford the ideal place for the set of these films. Compared to USC, which has the advantage of the California sun and a modern look, Oxford’s appeal lies in its antiqueness.
In addition, I learned that C.S. Lewis, author of the Narnia series, and J.R.R. Tolkien, best known for writing Lord of the Rings, were both university professors and friends who grew to prominence while in Oxford. Like most artists they used their surroundings — at times, the most essential items around the campuses — as inspiration. On my tour, my guide pointed out the door and the lamppost that Lewis references in the kids’ adventures.
Further on the tour, I learned that Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland was also penned in Oxford, for the daughter of the dean of one of the colleges. It seemed like every block was another literary moment that occurred.
As a USC student, it is easy to become desensitized to the art making that occurs around campus. We see another film set and say, “Oh that’s just another movie being filmed.”
But Oxford showed me that the magic of a city lies in the history of its books and movies. I’m just fortunate that traveling to a new city has allowed me to appreciate USC that much more.
