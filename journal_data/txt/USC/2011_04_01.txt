Lawmakers in Sacramento failed to reach a consensus Thursday on how to solve the State’s mounting budget deficit.
Gov.  Jerry Brown had hoped to receive a minimum of four republican votes in  order to mandate a special election on maintaining tax increases,  implemented in 2009 under then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
Currently  about half of the State’s, $26 billion budget deficit, has been solved  through a series of budget cuts including a $500 million cut in funding  for the University of California system.
The  other $13 billion Gov. Brown planned to recuperate from sustaining  current, elevated tax levels. The tax increases cost an average family  $260 a year, according to the state Department of Finance.
Republicans  insist that Gov. Brown’s budget plan is insufficient, and they refuse  to pass a plan that does not meet their minimal needs, which includes  greater cuts in pensions and an increase in business incentives.
Democrats,  however, are warning Republicans that the time of compromise may have  reached its end, and they will move forward with their budget plan  regardless of Republican approval.
If  neither party can come to an agreement, California residents could see  additional cuts in public services such as the DMW and garbage  collection.

After taking classes with USC professor Michael Kodama, Alan Huynh joined Kodama’s urban planning consulting group after graduating in 2010. Huynh, who studied urban planning at USC, sat down with the Daily Trojan to talk about his experiences.
Daily Trojan: What made you interested in urban planning and transportation development?
Alan Huynh: I took a class with a professor named Michael Kodama. He’s a really cool guy. His class made urban planning make sense. I keep on following in his footsteps to see where it will lead me.
DT: Have you always been interested in the affairs of your surrounding community?
Alan Huynh 
Huynh: Well, I am from Portland originally, so I grew up riding my bike a lot and ended up exploring the city and becoming interested in it that way.
DT: What do you think makes an ideal city?
Huynh: First, communication between administrations. Second, a lot of open public spaces so that people would want to interact with their city … Whether it be a cool sidewalk, like Union Street in the Bay Area. It’s so vibrant and public that people just go there to see what’s going on. The last thing you would want is a [lack of a] variety of people that live there. It’s good to have a diverse set of individuals so that people don’t get bored.
DT: What do you think makes an ideal urban planner?
Huynh: You have to be patient, and that is the most important thing. You also have to be able to communicate well … Social media right now is at the forefront, it’s about being underneath what’s being said and how you can use those tools. Also you have to understand how things connect together.
DT: How did your time at USC shape your motivations and allow you to give back to the community?
Huynh: I interned at so many public offices like Pasadena and the City of L.A. It gave me the experience to understand what they deal with on a daily basis. That knowledge helps me understand how a lot of things work. Now when I work with community groups, non-profits, I know more or less where to go. USC has let me better serve community groups and the community.
DT: What did you most enjoy about USC?
Huynh: You meet so many different people; we all have a certain competitive nature to ourselves and even a certain swagger. It was cool to be around people that were really different but at the same time really the same.
DT: What advice would you give to fellow Trojans who are interested in urban planning, or simply in the affairs of Los Angeles or other cities?
Huynh: It would be to get down and really understand things at the ground level. When you’re a student, you have the time to do so. Explore things, understand cohesively what all these different groups and agencies are trying to do. Having that ground-level experience once you start working and doing real planning, that’s the difference between the crew that rises to the top and everybody else. That ground experience is vital and how you will stand out.

Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi and Vice President Logan Lachman take office today, hoping to improve the connection between students, USG and the university administrators.
Work · Monish Tyagi, USG president, and Logan Lachman, USG vice president, hope to add a fall break and increase Campus Center hours. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
Among his immediate goals, Tyagi said he wants to grow USG’s role as an organization that promotes students’ interests.
“We’re going to implement lobbying [for student interests], plan events through Program Board and increase opportunities for students to offer their input,” Tyagi said. “Now we’re trying to pick the team that can best do that.”
The Tyagi-Lachman administration is finalizing its executive cabinet. Although they take office today, Tyagi and Lachman will not officially announce their cabinet until they are sworn in Tuesday.
During the election, Tyagi and Lachman said they plan to find a solution to the on-campus “bike issue,” extend the hours of the Campus Center, talk to city officials about closing The Row to cars at one end, and increase the number of restaurants and businesses near campus where USCards are accepted.
Tyagi also intends to work to expand several initiatives pushed by former president Chris Cheng, such as creation of a fall break, addition of more two-unit classes and increased communication between USG and USC administration and sustainability.
Tyagi said he was very excited to take office.
“It’s surreal at this point,” Tyagi said. “It’s been a month in waiting since we found out we won the election. Chris did a great job preparing and teaching me, so I feel like I’m ready for it.”

Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann have donated $15 million to build a new student health center.
“I’m extremely excited and grateful,” said Larry Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center. “It’s taken 15, 16 years to get a new facility. It’s kind of a dream come true.”
Swapped · The University Park Health Center and Physical Therapy Center will be replaced by a new building, set to open January 2013. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan 
Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann have been long-time supporters of USC. Michele is a 1968 alumna of the School of Theatre, and is now a member of the USC Board of Trustees. Both of Michele’s parents graduated from USC, and her father, Rod Dedeaux, coached the USC baseball team for 45 years; Dedeaux Field is named in his honor. Two of Roger and Michele’s children also graduated from USC.
This donation, which was announced Thursday, is the next chapter of Roger and Michele’s legacy.
The Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann Student Health Center will be built on Jefferson Boulevard, near Fluor Tower. This new five-story center will be 101,000 square feet and will be built in USC’s “traditional architectural style.”
Construction of the health center will begin this summer, and is set to open in January of 2013.
The new health center will feature laboratory and medical imaging facilities, and a separate clinic for USC faculty and staff for treatment of minor health problems.
The health center will focus on health promotion and prevention, and will contain special clinics in dermatology, acupuncture, orthopedics, oral health, allergy and gynecology.
“Everytime we wanted to add something, it’s been hard because we didn’t have enough rooms,” Neinstein said. “With the new building we will be able to speed things up and get people seen faster.”
Because space in the health center has been limited in the past, many services had to move to other locations around campus. The new facility will be a larger space, and will house all medical services including counseling, physical therapy and insurance services in one central location. Different levels will also be specialized.
“We have outgrown our site over the past 15 years with a large increase in visits, as we have become a residential campus community,” Neinstein wrote in an email.
The Engemann Student Health Center will also work toward planning and facilitating care for issues related to local and natural disasters, such as earthquakes, terrorist attacks and infectious disease outbreaks.
Students share Neinstein’s excitement about the new health center.
“It’s great and a needed improvement,” said Anne Riggs, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “A lot of people don’t go, not for the lack of treatment or ability, but [because] the facility doesn’t reflect the professionals that work there.”
Riggs also said the additional space for private exam rooms will draw more people to the health center.
Jordan Smith, a first year Ph.D. student studying industrial and systems engineering, agreed.
“There’s not a hospital on campus,” Smith said. “It would probably be good for USC to have something of a higher volume and greater capacity.”
The groundbreaking ceremony for the Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann Student Health Center will be held April 4 at 3:30 p.m. in Parking Lot L on Jefferson Boulevard, near the building’s future site.
What a great gift for the students and extra peace of mind for parents of students, when they are away from home.
Thanks to the Engemanns’ for their generosity and such a thoughtful gift.

Hundreds of students plan to walk out of their classes Monday to call attention to the issues raised by the obscene viral email that has been linked to the Kappa Sigma fraternity.
Students from the USC Coalition for a Safer Campus and Community, Women’s Student Assembly and numerous other campus organizations organized the “USC Walkout for a Safer Campus,” which will feature a demonstration and a moderated open mic session at 11 a.m. in front of Tommy Trojan.
“We just want the administration to see that the dissemination of the email and what the email said represents a larger problem that the USC community refuses to ignore,” said Corey Arterian, a senior majoring in English and a member of the Coalition for a Safer Campus and Community. “Furthermore, we want the administration to give it the attention it deserves. We also felt like this would be a great way to spark a public dialogue.”
Arterian emphasized the purpose of the walkout is not to blame others for the recent scandal, but to engage positive conversation and promote awareness of misogyny and racism around campus.
“This is not an attack, but rather an encouragement to reflect on our cultural perceptions of women and men,” Arterian said.
Joann Park, a freshman majoring in communication, said she plans to attend the walkout because she is upset the issues raised by the content of the email are a joke to some students.
“This email and these photos are associated with our school,” Park said. “I do not want misogyny and these things to be attached to myself at job interviews. You are a Trojan, a student and we have a reputation to uphold.”
Alicia Lu, a senior majoring in neuroscience and sociology and a member of the Coalition for a Safer Campus and Community, said the event’s organizers hope to raise awareness not only of misogyny, but of racism as well.
“A lot of people have been talking about it as if it just affects women,” Lu said. “I really want to bring the conversation in that racism is not acceptable just like it is unacceptable to call women targets or to say that nonconsent is different from rape.”
Several members of the administration have also been invited to attend the walkout.
“It is important that the USC administration and Office of the Provost realize that students demand a more thorough and serious response from the university regarding these issues,” said Emilia Ana Cosma, a junior majoring in public relations and international relations and executive director of the Women’s Student Assembly. “We are hoping that the event will urge USC administration and students to more seriously consider the issues of rampant misogyny and sexual violence on campus, rather than just brushing these issues to the side.”
Lu said she hopes the event will also decrease the stigma surrounding the act of rallying.
“Gathering together and rallying is not crazy,” Lu said. “It’s normal and it’s a strong way to make sure everyone’s voice is heard and to connect people of different communities who share common values and say, ‘Hey, we care about the same issues.’”
Some students, however, feel the walkout doesn’t serve a purpose.
“I don’t think [the walkout is] necessary,” said Meagan Mason, a Ph.D. student studying musicology. “People have already spoken up about it and I think that’s enough.”
Organizers are encouraging men to attend to participate in the discussion and disprove any negative stereotypes.
“Men are a part of this campus and are also negatively influenced by certain gender perceptions that run rampant in mainstream society,” Arterian said. “[They] are as much as part of this fight as women. Men showing up to this event effectively dismantles this dangerous perception that some women have bought into in the wake of this email and its wide dissemination.”
Tal Peretz, a graduate student studying sociology and a member of USC’s MenCare, will attend the walkout Monday and said he hopes other men will come to the event as well.
“The fact is that emails like that give all men a bad name, and it makes it completely justifiable for women to fear men or have a distaste for men,” Peretz said. “So I think men need to be out there and working to change that.”
Abby Fass, a junior majoring in psychology and communication, said she agrees this is an important issue that affects both men and women.
“This is a slippery slope problem,” she said. “The jokes get worse and worse, and suddenly they are extremely hurtful. This is why it is important to call upon the university to help even out the playing field again.”
Organizers of the event expect about 200 people will attend the demonstration.  More than 250 people indicated they are attending on a Facebook event as of press time.
“If 250 [people] show up, that will be amazing,” Arterian said. “The more, the better.”
Boys and girls…notice that I did not say Ladies and Gentlemen…what shocking news coming out of USC about the obscene viral email …it was on Jay Leno and one of Fox News most watched shows..The O’Reiley Factor…What a disgrace for USC and how embarrassing as well for the school, the parents, the alumni.  Perhaps this little walk out should be about respect and integrity the 2 things you will need to succeed in the REAL world!  How about having a speakout about respecting each other, respecting your school and having respect for your parents who foot the bill to go to USC.  Shame, shame, shame!
That was part of the point of the walkout.  You should understand through this that the student’s are completely against what happened.  The issues came out of a single student, not the students as a whole.  Insulting the majority of the student body isn’t very respectful nor is it mature.  One of the points of the walkout and discussion was to prove our respect and work back for our integrity as a single student tarnished that.  Shame shame for judging a student body for one’s actions.
I think the walk-out should end in a march up the stairs of WPH to the roof where all the feminists remove their tops to show their ….. (contempt / anger / power / saggy fun bags)
Still waiting for the candle light vigil.  Our water balloons aren’t going to last much longer so please get it underway soon!
Cameras are ready.  I think I’ll use a soft focus on these girls & metros
What a great article! Way to go DT in getting thorough coverage from many different people planning to attend. It really gets at what the event is about. Looking forward to seeing what happens now!
You must have a personal vendetta against her? What, she snub your advances? Loser.
Not at all. She just reinforces my (apparently accurate) perception of COMM majors.

Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson placed The Row on social probation Thursday, prohibiting informal gatherings at fraternities on Tuesday and Thursday nights for the rest of the spring semester because of the recent negative events within the Greek community.
Parties at fraternity houses will only be allowed Fridays and Saturdays, according to Jackson. These events must be reviewed and approved by the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development.
“If houses are found in violation of these instructions, they will be placed on immediate suspension pending a group judicial hearing,” Jackson wrote in an email. 
Jackson met with more than 150 leaders from USC fraternities and sororities Thursday to discuss the state of The Row, which has been plagued by behavioral problems and public incidents this year.
“We discussed the collective responsibility chapters have for their members and that the Greek Councils have for their chapters,” Jackson wrote.  
This is the second time this year The Row has been placed on social probation.
The Row was shut down Aug. 30, after 16 Interfraternity Council chapters were cited for unauthorized parties. Eight students were taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning during what is often referred to by students as “Black Monday.”
More recently, a misogynistic email sent on the Kappa Sigma fraternity listserv spread virally around campus and beyond, and graphic photos of a suspended member of Kappa Sigma appearing to have sex on the rooftop of Waite Phillips Hall made national news. 
Pat Lauer, president of IFC, said the leaders of USC fraternities and sororities understand how serious the situation is, and now they need to pass that message on to all of the Greek members.
“Because of everything that’s happened, we need to get our act together completely and identify our weak points and improve upon them,” Lauer said. “It’s up to the leaders to help change the culture of the Greek community that has taken a negative turn.”
At Thursday’s meeting, Jackson also established a task force composed of leaders of the various Greek councils and university staff from the USC Center for Women and Men and MenCare.
Denzil Suite, associate vice president for Student Affairs, will be heading the task force, which will address issues including risk management, hazing, sexual assault, healthy relationships, alcohol and substance abuse, knowledge of USC policies, and chapter fire, health and safety programs.
“I told students that we are depending on them to step up as leaders of their organizations, that [Student Affairs] will provide leadership, guidance and support, and that we want USC to have the strongest possible Greek community,” Jackson wrote.
Lauer said the Greek community needs to make sure the negative attention from these actions does not conceal the positive things the Greek community brings to the university.
“We’re kind of on thin ice right now, and we need to take it upon ourselves to confront these challenges we are faced with,” Lauer said.
Jackson pointed out that USC’s Greek community has the highest GPA of any school west of the Mississippi and has received many national awards for service and leadership.
“The hard work students devote to community service, philanthropic activity and participation in providing leadership for the broader USC student community is severely tarnished when members’ actions are arrogant, selfish, show a lack of respect for others, and threaten women in our community,” Jackson wrote.
It is up to the members of the Greek community to change this negative perception, according to Lauer.
“We owe it to ourselves to fix this image,” Lauer said.
So wait the Greeks are still allowed parties Fridays and saturdays ? What kind of probation is that ?
I appreciate the water the AGO boys give me on Thursday nights. I could not drink as much without reliable bottle of H20
Unfortunately, it wasn’t just about the emails or the roof sex….there were numerous less widely known incidents that lead to this….it’s unfortunate but hopefully this will all just blow over before nxt year.
May I point out that there IS one upstanding fraternity on the row at USC:  AGO.   No one is perfect, but these young men really do embody what frats started out to be.  It’s interesting to note how many of their non-member friends, both men and women, like to hang out at the AGO house.  There’s a good reason for that.   No one at AGO is doing anything harmful or illegal, but they’re still managing to have more fun and build just as many friendships as guys at other frats.  These guys seem to understand that the word fraternity is not synonymous with “all out party down  24/7 reckless behavior”.
There is also a reason why most women on the row feel uncomfortable at AGO where guys have regularly shoved religion down their throats rather than having a decent conversation.  It’s no coincidence that most women are bored after an hour at exchanges whereas they don’t want to leave when they’re with other real frats.
Better than a penis….
This may or may not be the funniest thing I’ve ever read.

AGO isn’t a real frat. It’s a bible study group with a house.
^ Like.
As somebody who used to be associated with them, I wholeheartedly agree.
This article should mention that “informal gatherings on Tuesdays and Thursdays” with alcohol or after 10 pm were always prohibited under SCampus. The only difference from last week is that Dr. Jackson has informed greek leaders that these portions of SCampus will now be strictly enforced.
Registered social events that comply with SCampus (ie formals, exchanges, registered parties) are still allowed, so this isn’t really even social probation…
That would require the writer to actually do research on what she is reporting…sounds tough though so why not just base you article of gossip websites instead?
I’m in a multi-cultural Greek org and although we really don’t have any involvement with what goes on at “the row” I’m still sad at the negative light this brings to the entire Greek system. To be honest, I agree it isn’t the entire IFC/PHC that should be punished for the actions of a few individuals. But the punishment at least for the student who wrote the email should be harsher. As for the guy having sex, it’s true, could have been anyone. 
I also think the school put “the row” on probation in order to provide a scapegoat and make it look like something is being done about the issue. But what is probation going to do? The mentality of Greeks doesn’t actually change.
I hope this task force isn’t about just implementing new rules and more of that alcohol/hazing edu crap. That doesn’t do anything. Programming needs to be implemented that brings to light the consequences of people’s actions. In addition, the university needs to start supporting and highlighting the positive actions of Greeks.
Since my father was an WWII vet and then SAE in the 50’s, and I was a Theta in the 80’s who also worked for the Eminent Archon (CEO) at the SAE Levere Memorial Temple in Evanston, IL, I have watched the continuous decline of the male side of the Greek system on almost every campus.  Just walk down any Greek area and you can instantly see which houses are the frats and which are the sororities.  Young men have lost sight of why fraternities were founded just after the Civil War–it was about brotherhood, honor, civility, chivalry, honesty and kindness–in other words, being a true gentleman.  Sadly, these characteristics are not the focus of fraternities.  It’s all about drunken parties, hazing, drugs, girls and trashing one’s own home.  Our son is a scholarship athlete at USC and thankfully, recognized all the negativity around fraternities and despite being a triple legacy, chose not to pledge.   And I’m not sure frats can or should be saved because it would take such an enormous mental shift..  Every young man today needs to read “UNBROKEN” by Laura Hillibrand about former USC alum and Kapp Sig fraternity member Louis Zamperini, Japanese POW who endured weeks on a raft in the ocean, and years under the thumb of a cruel POW camp leader.  That man epitomizes what a true man is about.  I am sure he, alive at 93, is horrified about what his fraternity has become considering the sacrifices he and his generation made.  To all fraternity boys–wake up, grow up and start acting like men.
Thanks for this!
You are making me very sleepy……….
Awww… is Frat Boy sad he can’t party every night now? lol
Frat boys need permission from the school just to throw a party, and they still can’t figure out why 75% of the school chooses not to go greek. 
Rag on “GDI”‘s all you want – at least we can do whatever the hell we feel like without getting a green light from some school committee first.
This is absolutely ridiculous – the entire Greek system, which is mostly comprised of ethical, intelligent, hard working, fun-loving, philanthropic, and kind young adults should not be made to pay for the mistakes of 2 irresponsible students.  THis message is NOT promoting all the good things about the Greek System that you outline in your article – rather than punishing all of them, why not create an opportunity for them to showcase all the good that they do. Very disappointed in this decision.
“mostly comprised of ethical, intelligent, hard working, fun-loving, philanthropic…” <– lol
there’s a reason you were at UCLA and not USC. makes a lot of sense, in fact.
the Greek system has those hard working, fun-loving folks but also has a strong majority of the opposite. i don’t know what facade you lived in at your sorority, but let’s face it: it exists, so stop trying to be ignorant to the reality. the Row has had this coming for some time now, and it’s only been a matter of time really.
This seems to be a situation where a few bad apples spoil the bunch.  As a USC alumna who was in a sorority, I am appalled by the actions of some of these select few men and women.  It does not reflect well on fraternities and sororities in general, not just the USC greek community.
Also, it’s a community, not a system.  Sometimes the whole group needs to be punished for the actions of a few.  Perhaps this will be an object lesson and teach other members of the greek community to think  twice before acting, because their actions could have repercussions for others.
i’m not in the greek system but I think the probation is kind of stupid if it’s because of the pictures. It could have been anybody up there bangin on the roof, it just happened to be a guy in kappa sig. It’s not like he speaks for the whole greek system.
It sounds like the administration is pissed about all of the recent happenings and just needs somebody to blame.
Greeks can suck it.
Thanks Kappa Sig!   You guys won’t be missed!
