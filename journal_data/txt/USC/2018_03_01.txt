Last weekend, USC Admissions tweeted that high school students disciplined for participating in peaceful political protests regarding gun control would not be penalized in the admissions process. USC was just one of several universities across the country — including MIT, Stanford and American University — that have issued statements.
Universities are just the latest entities to wade into the political fray following the Feb. 14 tragedy in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman with an assault rifle entered a high school and left 17 dead. Corporations like Dick’s Sporting Goods and Walmart have announced stricter regulations on their sales of firearms. Delta Airlines and Hertz Rent-a-Car have ended their partnerships with the National Rifle Association. And high school students have taken the politics of gun control into their own hands by starting the nationwide  #NeverAgain movement. Now, universities have joined the movement too. This is important not only for the rights of students, but also in cultivating university environments that support students, from filling out their applications through their graduations. 
What has followed the Parkland tragedy is a positive departure from the norms of mourning and internalized helplessness that have gone hand-in-hand with the far too many mass shootings we’ve witnessed in recent history. Student and survivor-led, goal-oriented activism has surfaced and is arguably more energized than any other movement in recent memory. Therefore, it is universities that should protect and uphold their rights to do so without punishment. 
High schools in states like Texas, Louisiana and other predominantly conservative regions are threatening students who participate in political walkouts or miss school to protest for gun control reform with suspension and other disciplinary action that will go on students’ permanent records. Because disclosure of disciplinary records is often required in college applications, these high school administrations are sending a political message of their own: that students who wish to express their values and make their voices heard should be punished and denied opportunity. This is damaging to students because instead of civic participation, these schools are sending the message that young people should either be silent and know their place or suffer the consequences for breaking from this norm.
Therefore, it is up to universities to purvey a counter-message. Just as corporations and students have sent a counter-message in the face of policymakers’ inaction on the issue of gun control, universities painting political activism as something to be applauded and defended, rather than punished, matters just as much. If this movement has taught us anything, messaging matters. People and organizations speaking out matters. 
Schools should be sanctuaries. Students shouldn’t have to fear for their lives, and should be able to speak up when they do. Any university that is committed to equipping its student body with the tools to make a positive difference in the world must also stand up for students’ rights to create that change. 
Of course, it’s worth noting that not all high school students who wish to simultaneously participate in the political dialogue, act on their convictions and pursue higher education are immunized by these high-profile universities’ promises. Low-income students in conservative-leaning states may rely on admissions from public, local colleges that may not share the sentiments of USC’s admissions office and its forward-thinking admissions policy. 
In their lifetimes, young people have witnessed the devastating cases of Sandy Hook, a shooting that claimed 27 lives at a Connecticut elementary school in 2012; they have seen 10 killed in a mass shooting at an Oregon community college in 2015; 49 killed at an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando in 2016; and 59 killed by a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October. 
And simultaneously, last month, they watched President Donald Trump roll out a budget proposal that would slash $25 million from school safety and violence prevention programs. The student survivors of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have watched Florida state lawmakers refuse to even debate a ban on assault weapons immediately after the school shooting, and listened to excuses from their senator, Marco Rubio, about the millions that he receives annually from the National Rifle Association. 
In this context, it is nothing short of awe-inspiring that young people, many of whom are not yet even allowed to vote, could look at such a devastating situation and still have hope, feel passion and want to partake in a fight that many seasoned, adult politicians lose every time. To discourage rather than reward this resilience is an unthinkable attack on a generation that has, for far too long, been punished by the American political system and the action-less “leaders” it has produced. 
Going forward, in order to build an engaged student body, — one that is not only passionate but also transforms passion into action and initiative — universities must be mindful of prospective students’ disciplinary records. If we truly want equal civic participation from all demographics, universities must not punish but embrace student activism.

We are millennials and we’d like our seat at the table now, please.
Some might argue that one of the benefits of President Donald Trump’s administration is the great political awakening of college-aged voters, and the millennial and Gen Z generations specifically. But while some of us are catching up, others have been at this for years — movements from #BlackLivesMatter to #MeToo to #NeverAgain have all long been popularized and propagated by millennials, on platforms that cater to us, in environments that we live in and understand.
Last weekend, I attended the California Democratic Convention in San Diego. By congressional and gubernatorial candidates alike, millennial interests — economic equity, college access and affordability among them — were paid only the most slapdash of lip service. Midterm elections are coming up. They should become the first battleground of the millennial awakening.
It’s not such an asinine idea; in some ways, our political demands have often been met. The old guard, led by people like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, has curated Instagram accounts.
During her 2016 presidential campaign, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried her hand at Snapchat. The media we’ve created for our own purposes has been integrated into a political system that supposedly revolves around the whims of older representatives to cater to the ideal, reliable voter, who also tends to be older.
And yet, in so many ways we’ve set the terms of the new landscape. Twitter dethroned giants during the #MeToo movement. The teenage Parkland survivors have made a bigger dent in the fight for gun control than any other group of activists or lobbyists before them. Of course, this is all to say that we have clout. And it seems, recently at least, that we’re finally becoming willing to own it. So the question remains — what will our political ethos really be?
In a recent article in the Sunday Review entitled “My Kid’s First Lesson in Realpolitik,” columnist Annie Pfeifer writes that in Switzerland, children are allowed to solve their own conflicts, even by brutal physical means, whereas modern American parents prefer to intervene early. This, Pfeifer contends, is why we prefer our echo chambers — because early on, conflict is forcibly removed from our lives. Coddling, she argues, is the millennials’ fundamental political problem. Maybe she’s right; we, as a generation, are more entitled. But perhaps we are also more empathetic.
As recent social justice movements can attest — the explosion of an enforcement of inclusive language, innovation of the notion of “safe spaces,” the outrage against unfairness in institutional structures — Millennials seem distinctly dissatisfied by institutionalized inequity, precisely because they are more accepting of the social theory that unfairness is wrong, that people should generally act agreeably and that all discriminatory aggression is unacceptable. 
Maybe this strange mix of entitlement and empathy — our aggregate political interest in accountability, services and justice — will lead us toward a new day. And hopefully, soon, it will oust a congress interested in none of those things.
Our attitude is a product of how we’ve been raised. Perhaps, as Pfeifer argues, it’s part of the environment we’re in. Hours more of drill-esque work at far younger ages, harder and more expansive tests with more, and higher, standards, lower admission rates and more selective criteria for higher education, greater rates of competition, more economic barriers to hurdle and tough post-grad job prospects — this is a generation expected to perform at the highest possible level at all times. So why can’t our representatives do the same? 
This is a generation that expects more from the system as it stands; it is also a generation that believes it is important and powerful enough to make radical change. After all, it’s what we’ve been expected to do. 
Millennial entitlement has little to do with work ethic, and more with what we expect that work to elicit. We expect solutions that make sense, and circumstances that are equitable — and that headstrong audacity has made us one of the most powerful forces in modern politics.
Where is the Nanny Generation? Right here, the entire time. Being coddled and being pushed, and at the end of the day, being scapegoated. Thank you for waking us up. We’ll be taking our seats now.

Some of my favorite podcasts were made for kids. 
Art by Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Nate Butkus, a 7-year-old who loves science, hosts The Show About Science, on which he talks to experts in fields ranging from ant biology to childhood cancer. Butkus is naturally curious, and he’s very smart — he asks his guests insightful questions and handles complex scientific material with ease. 
Another podcast made for kids is NPR’s Wow in the World. It’s hosted by Guy Raz, a seasoned podcaster who also hosts the TED Radio Hour. On Wow in the World, he builds connections between various TED talks on a specific topic while delving deeper into the topics through interviews with the TED speakers.
With Wow in the World, Raz and co-host Mindy Thomas talk about scientific topics similar to those Raz often discusses on the TED Radio Hour, but they’re enhanced by creative sound effects and brilliant voice acting to create an engaging yet deeply educational podcast. 
It’s easy to dismiss children as uneducated or inexperienced, but their critical thinking abilities often surpass our expectations, and their abilities to understand complex ideas — like those talked about in The Show about Science and Wow in the World — are surprisingly high-level. 
I get to see the brilliance of children on a daily basis at Hoover Intergenerational Care, a preschool just off the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street. Through the Americorps Jumpstart program, other teachers and I go into the classroom twice a week, with a curriculum built around a core storybook that we read to them. The children are eager to learn, and we have the privilege of exposing them to the fascinating world we live in. 
My favorite part of our Jumpstart sessions is “Let’s Find Out About It,” where we introduce them to new ideas — things we might consider commonplace, like the concept of reflections and why certain objects create them or not. 
But when 3-year-olds discover these simple beauties of life for the first time, their fascination, the bright smiles that envelope their faces, their innocent voices shouting, “Teacher Karan! I can see my face in the paper! [mirror],” remind me of the amazing world around us that I too often take for granted.

Wow in the World and The Show About Science bring that childlike innocence to all of the podcast’s topics. The genuine, curiosity that children bring to discussions of everyday life reveal unexpected discoveries about how the world works that we would never think to consider. 
It’s a cliche, but kids are our future, and their education is one of the most important investments we can make today. Podcasts aren’t a medium limited to an older population; like television or books, they’re a narrative form that people of all ages should be able to enjoy. The Show about Science and Wow in the World are making podcasts more accessible for children — an educational format that will undoubtedly prove to develop a generation of insightful and creative individuals. 
Working with 3-year-olds on a daily basis has taught me a lot, beyond classroom management and education skills. They’ve shown me that I live in a world full of wonders, and taught me to appreciate it. In turn, I believe it’s our responsibility to invest in our children. And podcasts like Wow in the World and The Show About Science that provide kids with insightful and complex material in an engaging way are a great way to do that.

For alternative pop band Last Flight Out, February has been one of the most important months of their fledgling career. The trio released their first EP, “Baggage,” on Spotify and Apple Music, while performing their first live shows as a group, including a noontime slot in front of Tommy Trojan on Monday. 
As graduation day approaches, Last Flight Out is unsure what will happen to the band, compelling the trio to give their all to music while they still can. Photo courtesy of Last Flight Out.
The band comprises three USC seniors: Christopher Meyer on lead vocals and keyboards, Joey Hall on drums and Paul Chyz on guitar and the production front. The three have been musically involved throughout their time at USC, but Last Flight Out is undoubtedly the largest project to date for each of them.
Last Flight Out is a USC band through and through. Hall, an electrical engineering major, and Meyer, a biological science major, met in the dorms as freshmen, bonding early over their mutual passion for music. While the two have been jamming as friends for a while, they never considered writing and performing their own songs until last year.
Hall describes their initial vision as a “two-person, Twenty One Pilots-esque thing” where Meyer is on lead vocals and keyboard and Hall handles the drumming. When recording over the summer, however, the two felt that their instrumental lineup was scarce, which led to Hall’s enlistment of Chyz’s guitar and production chops.
Chyz, an electrical engineering major and music recording minor, has played guitar since he was six years old, and started teaching himself music production as a teenager. Before joining the group, his compositions and contributions were mostly guitar-based instrumental pieces, along with various remixes and reconstructions of existing songs.
On Baggage, Chyz provides refreshing guitarwork and tasteful synthesizers that give the power-pop style songs more color. As a whole, the mix of personalities and influences on the EP is apparent as each member had a hand in the songwriting process. 
Meyer describes the project as a collection of themes that he has noticed in everyday life, with stories that touch on partying, relationships and the experience of youth. Hall’s varied, and at times almost tribal, style of drumming also provide an intriguing take on the pop music that has inspired Meyer for so long.
As Meyer describes it, the name Last Flight Out implies one of the band’s heavier realities: They feel they have very little time left to pursue a career in music. With all three members expected to graduate this May, the band’s future is not entirely clear at this point.
“This is kind of our last chance, our last realistic opportunity to go into music,” Meyer said. “We do have science as well, which was something we were planning on pursuing until this showed up, but we’re really working hard to make it happen.”
While each of their plans for the future are not concrete at this point, they ultimately plan on remaining in Los Angeles after graduation. If this scenario unfolds, Hall says the band will stay together as long as it can.
“The plan is to stay in Los Angeles and keep playing music,” Hall said without hesitation. “The plan is to take this as far as we can.” 
The blueprint is certainly unclear for the trio’s future after graduation, but USC’s campus should provide the best possible stage for the finale of their college careers.

When he wasn’t displaying his talents on the saxophone, lead singer Nick Ferraro impressed with his singing and performance. Photo by Kenan Draughorne | Daily Trojan
A live setting is integral to the jazz experience, adding another layer to the rich instrumentation that shines through on recordings. For guitarist Louis Stein from the Montreal-based band Busty and the Bass, seeing those listener reactions while performing in intimate venues always puts a smile on his face.
“It’s not just a sea of heads, you can see individual reactions and when somebody really digs something,” Stein said, comparing the setting to larger festivals that draw crowds in the thousands. “It gives me flashbacks to when we wrote that part or made that arrangement choice, it just brings it full circle.”
The band garnered plenty of those visual responses at their Wednesday night show at The Troubadour, even returning for an encore after being summoned by applause. Weaving through its catalogue, Busty and the Bass dipped between moods, sounds and styles with ease, always keeping the audience on their toes for what was coming next.
Lead singer Nick Ferraro stole the show with his expressive vocals, as well as his talents on the saxophone. Equal parts passionate and joyful, Ferraro showed his versatility over the various styles of music provided by the band behind him, putting on a performance that had something for everyone.
After years of working with Ferraro, Stein mentioned how the singer has pushed him to be as precise as possible when it comes to songwriting, so the flow of the song can resonate as deeply as the story in his lyrics.
“From Nick, I’ve learned to be super picky with every lyric and every word; he’s a vocalist, so he makes sure that every word sounds good,” Stein said. “The rhythm and the emphasis, and keeping that flow as important as the meaning behind it, that’s been really cool.”
Stein says Busty and the Bass is more of a community than a band, creating a natural chemistry that’s grown as they’ve toured over the years. Everyone brings their own unique influences and musical traits to the table, and for Stein, that trait is his ability to push the band’s performance even further when they play together.
“When the band is cooking at a seven out of 10, I like to be the guy that pushes it a little more, when everyone is like, ‘Should we do it one more time?’” Stein said. “I’ll try to do something that encourages everyone to just go for it. Guitar-wise, just expanding textures, like the fact that we have keys doing chords, and then horns doing lead melodies, it puts the guitar in this interesting position of having to create its own space.”
Stein made the most of his time when he had his own space at the Troubadour on Wednesday, stunning the crowd with endless guitar riffs during his solos. During an extended instrumental break midway through the show, however, keyboardist Eric Haynes delivered perhaps the solo of the night, ratcheting up the improvisational value at every turn even after he’d already drawn earnest applause.
Busty and the Bass recognizes what can be accomplished in the group setting, allowing everyone to shine rather than pushing one individual forward into the spotlight. Their newest album Uncommon Good highlights this mentality, recognizing the musical landscape around them and how the group is bucking the norm by including so many different personalities under one name.
“In an era dominated by solo artists, we really believe in the power of the band and creative collaboration,” Stein said. “In some parts it was a painful process to come up with, but what we ended up finding was this common denominator that everyone could agree was dope, and touched on something that was true for them.”
It would have been easy for the album and the rest of their discography to linger within the realm of jazz, as each band member has an extensive background in the genre, but Stein said their aspirations for more have pushed them to craft their own individual sound that can connect with listeners no matter their musical preferences. The band already incorporates a wide range of styles in their music, but going forward, Stein wants to work more with hip-hop and old school funk as well as ambient, experimental sounds.
“There’s such a ceiling for jazz, it’s just a smaller world which makes it harder to reach as many people,” he said. “Just the nature of having so many people, everyone has their own take on what else they’re interested in, and our sound is just a product of that.”

The world of augmented reality has made incredible strides in recent years, and now USC students will be among the first to demo one of the most exciting apps in the field to date. Utilizing the burgeoning technology of AR, the new app Neon AR will make it easier to meet up with friends and navigate to points of interest. With its social-friendly interface, the app is designed to give users a fun experience that complements the practicality of the service it provides.
Neon, a new app created by alumnus Dave Urbina, augments reality by allowing users to see virtual makers showing where their friends are and “shoot” 3D emojis at people with the app in close proximity. Photo courtesy of Dave Urbina.
Founder Dave Urbina attended USC, and said that conducting beta testing with students at his alma mater was an easy decision.
“There’s a lot of learning to be had somewhere like USC, where students are trying to meet up every day,” he said. “There’s a lot of density, and so it makes sense for us to test there and get insightful feedback.” 
Urbina graduated from the School of Film and Television in 2006. While in school, Urbina said he was primarily interested in the immersiveness of cinema, but kept in mind alternative, less traditional career tracks he could pursue.
“I think because I didn’t put myself into a box and say, ‘I’m going to be a writer, I’m going to be a director,’ I had my mind open to the possibility of exploring other cinematic experiences,” he said. “That was basically the launching point for me and my pivot, in teaching myself how to code.”
The idea for Neon AR came to Urbina during a camping trip with his wife in 2015. Urbina wanted a way to connect real-life experiences with the virtual world, and realized an app could be the perfect way to realize his vision.
“The next morning, I thought to myself, ‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if we came back to this spot years later, with friends or kids, and I was able to open my phone and see a neon sign, saying this is where David camped on July 10, 2015?’” he said. “That was the genesis of it, the ability to expand a new layer on the world, and have a more engaging visceral connection with the physical world.”
Neon AR works by latching on to the user’s phone’s GPS signal, and then digitizing their real world location onto the phone with the onboard camera. When trying to find a user’s friend, the app positions a beacon that remains in place on the screen, allowing them to make their way over to them with the virtual aid. The user interface incorporates fun elements to enliven the experience, and make the on-screen world even more engaging.
“The way that you interact in the app, you can shoot 3-D emojis at people,” Urbina said. “So I shoot emojis at Tim and he gets a push notification, so he opens his phone and turns in my direction, and they come zooming at him, and he can fire back. Then I’ll look and see Sarah somewhere else eating lunch, and I can navigate to her and find her. It’s literally placing your friends visually in the world around you, so you can interact with them in a way that hasn’t been done.”
Writing the extensive code for Neon AR was somewhat challenging, especially as Urbina had only recently taught himself how to code. After searching for months for a partner with the right kind of experience to finish the app, Urbina found Tim Brandt, a graduate from the University of Michigan, who fulfilled all the necessary credentials.
Before joining Neon AR, Brandt had spent 11 years in the visual effects field, programming computer graphics and dabbling in computer vision. He had familiarity with GPS technology through his work on a safe-driving app, which would use users’ location to see if they were in a “danger zone” where focusing on the road was imperative. When Urbina reached out about his developing app, Brandt saw it as the perfect fit for his skillset and was eager to get involved.
“I was instantly excited about what he was doing, the project was uniquely tailored to my background,” Brandt said. “We were on the same wavelength and hit it off right away. We both have this vision for how technology can bring people together in the future, and we both see augmented reality as this new paradigm that allows that.”
Urbina tagged his good friend from USC, Rob Ogden, to serve as his adviser. Ogden did a little bit of everything when he came on board, assisting with strategy and capital raising, drawing on his years of experience in entrepreneurship.
For Ogden, keeping a primary focus on the product itself is paramount, and guided his philosophy when he joined the team. It wasn’t difficult for him to convince the Neon AR team to think accordingly, as Ogden said they were already operating along the same lines. While the initial product had a vast assortment of features, they agreed to settle on a core element to build the app around, which became the ability to find friends with more ease.
“Over time, the product has pivoted a bit here and there, it’s been an iterative process as these things tend to be,” Ogden said. “One of the things I stressed is finding a core focus and there not being too many features, and instead discovering the core utility of the product, which ended up being friend finding.”
Urbina sees the app becoming popular at massive gatherings such as Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where meeting up with groups amid large crowds can often be difficult. While bad cellular service is often a reason for this and could potentially hinder Neon AR’s usefulness, the final version of the app plans to use bluetooth location technology to keep the app online as festivals continue to bolster their infrastructure.
“Our belief is that you always bet on technology,” Urbina said. “If we can build a community of users, then when the technology matures, then we’ll be the first movers there, and will already be able to provide a robust user base to access with.”
Neon AR will be available Friday for download from the App Store.

To reduce waste on campus, the Environmental Student Assembly, Undergraduate Student Government and environmental student organization Environmental Core launched an online petition on Monday to eliminate plastic straws in campus dining halls. 
The Environmental Student Assembly, Environmental Core and Undergraduate Student Government started a petition to eliminate plastic straws in dining halls. Photo from USC Hospitality website.
At the time of publication, the petition had collected 1,009 signatures.
According to the petition, this initiative aims to reduce waste in dining halls by making all waste compostable. 
“Currently, our on campus dining halls do not compost the food waste coming from student’s plates; instead, this post-consumer food is going to landfills,” the petition stated. “Plastic straws are the only item preventing all items in the dining hall from being compostable.” 
According to Head of Procurement at USC Hospitality Louis Rodriguez, dining halls have been composting only pre-consumer foods, such as food scraps. 
Olivia Pearson, Emily Palmer and Claire Mauss of ESA, in collaboration with USG Sustainability Advocacy Director Philine Qian and Director of the Environmental Core Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, met with USC Hospitality to propose the removal of plastic straws on Feb. 22.
Rodriguez said the removal of straws would be feasible with student support and result in less negative student feedback. According to the petition, the residential dining staff would provide plastic straws only to students with disabilities who require straws for drinking.
“Someone had shared our petition and said they could not support it because they said that we were ignoring the disabled population who may need straws,” Pearson said. “That was not our intention and we are not trying to forge the needs of any students or members of the USC community as we are trying to work toward sustainability.”
In order for the removal of plastic straws to be enacted in the 2018-19 academic year, Shaw-Wakeman emphasized the need for campus support. 
“Historically, the sustainable initiatives have been started and pumped up by students,” Shaw-Wakeman said.

Making medicine. (From left to right) Sophomore Michael Kyzar, freshman Andrew Yock, senior Hope Miller and junior Margaret Field won the annual Translating Engineering Advances to Medicine Makeathon at UC Davis. Photo from Viterbi School of Engineering website.
Four students from the Viterbi School of Engineering were announced as the 2018 winners of the annual Translating Engineering Advances to Medicine Make-a-thon at UC Davis, according to a Viterbi news release. 
This design competition required student teams to utilize 3-D printing, laser-cutting machines and computer-aided design to create and build a functional medical device.
This year’s team from USC comprised Hope Miller, a senior studying biomedical engineering; Margaret Field, a junior studying mechanical engineering; Michael Kyzar, a sophomore studying computational neuroscience; and Andrew Yock, a freshman studying biomedical engineering. 
The teams were tasked with creating a device to speed up the production process of gel plates that are used to diagnose coccidioidomycosis, a soil fungus commonly known as valley fever. Their winning design will be implemented in the UC Davis Coccidioidomycosis Serology Lab, according to a Viterbi news release.
Yock, who came up with the idea for the winning design, said he was inspired by a tennis ball-collecting tube. 
Field said the biggest challenge the team faced was in the materials they were provided. She said it was difficult to build airtight prototypes with syringes and suction devices, so they opted to use straws which they had to laser-cut to the shapes they needed.
Miller, who wants to develop and work with biomedical devices after graduating, recommends the experience to other biomedical engineering students who wish to  get hands-on experience in the field. 
“Working with the mentors was a major perk of the competition,” Miller said in the news release. “It was also amazing to be surrounded by so many engineering students.”

Gary Oldman is a favorite to win Best Actor for Darkest Hour, but the other nominees in the category shouldn’t be overlooked. Photo from IMDB.
With the 90th Academy Awards coming up quickly, everyone in Hollywood is paying attention. Every year, FiveThirtyEight, the statistical website, offers predictions for winners in each Oscar category. Historically, these predictions have been fairly accurate. For instance, the website predicted every single winner correctly except for best picture. last year (They predicted La La Land, which actually was announced as the winner for a few minutes by mistake before Moonlight was named the winner.) Their statistical analysis models best actor and actress based off of other nominations and wins from other awards like BAFTA and SAG. 
They break down their predictions into three categories: “the clear front-runners,” “competitive races,” and “we have no clue.” Both the Best Actor and Best Actress winners in 2018 are predicted under “the clear frontrunners” category. For 2018 Best Actor and Best Actress, the site predicts Gary Oldman  will win for his performance in Darkest Hour and Frances McDormand for her performance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. 
Though Oldman is likely to win, the Best Actor award should go to either Timothée Chalamet (Call Me By Your Name) or Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) over Oldman. Chalamet’s performance of Elio perfectly captures the gut-wrenching melodrama that accompanies love and youth. To describe Chalamet’s portrayal as convincing would be an understatement. The actor beautifully embraces Elio, the emotionally conflicted 17-year-old at the cusp of adulthood. As a straight actor, Chalamet skillfully and eloquently presented a character questioning his own sexuality throughout the film. With subtlety and sensitivity, he guides the audience through the emotional turbulence of falling in love and reckoning with shifting perceptions of both one’s self and the surrounding world. 
Chalamet should be awarded not just for the dynamic range in his expression but also the parallel richness of his emotional displays. The final scene, in which Chalamet stares into a fireplace after a devastating phone call, requires no words on the actor’s part. His facial expressions alone are enough to send shivers down one’s spine.
Kaluuya’s character Chris in Get Out arguably offers the most socially impactful performance. The film hybridizes satire and horror and serves as a biting critique of race relations in the United States. Chris is an extremely nuanced character living in an even more complex world. An English actor from London, Kaluuya had to contend with critics who were skeptical of his ability to convincingly portray the experience of a black man in America. However, these challenges are not at all obvious in the final product. 
Kaluuya’s performance in the film is praised by many for capturing the black experience in the current American political climate. His subtle expressions in the film offer a fascinating interpretation of the quiet paranoia that haunts Chris throughout the movie. Director Jordan Peele certainly cast the right actor to play a character laden with so much symbolism and history. 
Though McDormand is declared the “clear frontrunner” for best actress, Saoirse Ronan’s nomination deserves more credit. Starring in the coming-of-age film Lady Bird, Ronan beautifully captures the emotional uncertainty of a fleeting youth and the state of being on the precipice of major life decisions. Ronan’s task to play the eccentric Christine, who re-names herself “Lady Bird,” reveals her ambition as an actress. Stuck in an emotional battle with her mother over many issues, primarily her independence, Ronan’s character captures the tumultuous realities of anxiety-ridden teenage years. The Irish actress truly understands and replicates the struggles of identity that accompany the life of a teenager in America. Whether or not Lady Bird ends up winning the award, Ronan’s alluring performance definitely makes the film an instant cult-classic and avoids falling in the common trap of being another cliche coming-of-age character.
Overall, to receive an Oscar nomination requires an exquisite performance. Any of the nominees is more than deserving of winning. However, Kaluuya, Chalamet and Ronan’s performances each demonstrate the actors’ exceptional abilities to overcome industry barriers and deliver a stunning performance. They exceeded expectations and created distinctive, memorable characters that will leave an enduring mark on Hollywood.

The USC administration has rebuked a story published by the Los Angeles Times in early February alleging that the University, frequently cited for its large-scale fundraising efforts, experienced a significant decrease in donations from July to Dec. 2017.
Graphic by Karan Nevatia | Daily Trojan
The Times reported that donations to the University were down $100 million, or 22 percent, when compared to the same six-month period in 2016. According to the article, donations for the Keck School of Medicine at USC were affected the most, raising only 45 percent of the funds it was able to procure in the previous year. 
This decline was attributed by the Times to a previous report they published on former Keck dean Carmen Puliafito. The report alleged that Puliafito used methamphetamines while associating himself with criminals. During the time of his alleged drug use, Puliafito had been seeing patients.
The USC administration questioned the legitimacy of the Times’ report on fundraising. 
“The story in the LA Times is factually incorrect,” said Albert Checcio, USC senior vice president of university advancement. “There has been no lapse in fundraising.” 
Checcio called the report a disservice to the USC community.
He said that examining donations received by the University over a six-month period, which does not end until June 30, is methodologically flawed. 
“You have to look at the full 12-month period,” Checcio said. “It’s really disingenuous to take a snapshot in time and try to fit it to a certain narrative … Even if we just look at that six month snapshot, it’s still unfair because it’s a 12-month year.” 
However, the Times stated in an email to the Daily Trojan that their reporting was accurate. 
“We stand behind our reporting,” a Los Angeles Times spokesperson wrote. “The story was based on USC’s own internal accounting of fundraising during the first half of the fiscal year, which shows the shortfall during that period.”
Checcio described fundraising as a continuum that could not be accurately measured on a fixed interval, referring to President C. L. Max Nikias’ “Campaign for USC” in 2011, which aimed to raise $6 billion in donations by the end of the 2018 fiscal year. 
The initiative, according to Checcio, hit its goal nearly 18 months ahead of schedule and has raised over $6.6 billion in funds as of last month. 
USC was ranked fifth among universities in 2017 in terms of total revenue raised from fundraising, behind Harvard, Stanford, Cornell and MIT.
“I’m really confident that overall fundraising to the University will be the same as last year,” Checcio said. 
Despite the funds generated by Campaign for USC, some argue that the administration’s handling of the scandal involving former Keck dean Carmen Puliafito has put a damper on fundraising efforts. 
Much of the Times’ report on Feb. 7 focused on the role Puliafito played in securing donations for the University, and on the resulting dissatisfaction of some alumni in the wake of the administration’s handling of the incident. 
While Checcio said that Keck experienced a decrease in donations over the six-month period examined by the Times, he said the decrease was not due to the findings regarding Puliafito.
“Carmen Puliafito was fired a year before [this period], he was not a factor in our fundraising,” Checcio said. “He was never a fundraising star at all here, none of those gifts had anything to do with him.”

From immigrant rights advocacy training to intimate partner violence therapy training, the USC chapter of the National Association of Social Workers provides direct resources for students at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.
The National Association of Social Workers chapter at USC hosted a Social Workers for Social Change conference in February last year that focused on advocacy following the divisive 2016 election. Photo courtesy of Shantel Vachani.
“The unit serves as a bridge, so [graduates] would continue to stay engage with the professional organization,” said assistant professor Shantel Vachani, who co-founded the NASW USC unit. “It’s really unique in that it’s not a student organization, it’s not an alumni organization, and it’s not a strictly professional organization … One of the things that we recognized is that our students today is our alumni tomorrow.”
The chapter was founded in 2015 by Vachani, assistant professor Susan Hess and senior lecturer Robert Hernandez. They believed it was important to supplement students with opportunities for learning and networking outside of the classroom setting.
According to the association’s website, its mission is to promote, develop and protect social workers and the profession while enhancing the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. 
Alix Schwartz and Neva Wallach are the co-student chairs of the NASW USC Unit.  They said the program focuses on recruiting and advancing the careers of students and alumni pursuing social work with the help of an institutional and national support system. 
“When students sign up for the NASW, they become part of a network of 130,000 social workers throughout the United States,” Wallach said. “In addition, [Dworak-Peck] has an exclusive virtual academic campus — there are USC [Master’s of Social Work] students in almost every state throughout the United States. I would argue that students who have attended some of our events virtually are furthering our national reach.”
NASW USC is the only one of its kind nationwide, as it provides many opportunities and programs for students at the University interested in social work to participate in service learning and involvement. 
The USC chapter hosted a Social Workers to Social Change conference in February last year, a call to action for advocacy and lobbying among the social worker community in response to a volatile political climate. 
“We try to find the intersections between different social justice issues that we just don’t see being talked about elsewhere,” Shantel said. “Almost all of our programs have been free, which is rare, and so we just really try to … build and develop a strong social work space.”
The NASW is going through a modernization process as they work to recruit more students. The organization aims to address the needs of students individually and generally as well. 
They also hope to increase the connection between students, alumni and the organization in coming years to foster a network of service advocacy and professional development, Shantel said.
“We are in a time of a lot of challenging social issues,” Shantel said. “Our hope for the upcoming years is for USC NASW to become a sustainable unit within USC that is able to be a part of the national association while [staying] grounded in the USC community.”

Undergraduate Student Government Senator Preston Fregia launched a petition on change.org Wednesday calling for a name change for the Von KleinSmid Center. 
By the time of publication, the petition garnered 127 signatures.
According to the petition, the building’s namesake, former USC President Rufus Von KleinSmid, was known for his role in the eugenics movement. The movement advocated for “improving the human race through selective breeding” methods like sexual sterilization and extermination of select groups that were considered undesirable. 
The petition listed Von KleinSmid’s history working in the eugenics movement, which included co-founding the Human Better Foundation, a eugenics organization in Pasadena.
“Some of his work inspired Nazis and was about how minorities should be weeded out of the population,” Fregia said. “And I think the kind of painful irony is me [going] to VKC everyday and [having] to sit through the … humiliating experience in a class where the guy who [the building] is named after didn’t think that your group or your race should exist on Earth.”
Fregia said that Von KleinSmid’s past with the eugenics movement does not reflect the University’s modern values. He also noted how VKC is “supposed to represent all cultures and all groups.”
On Wednesday, USG shared a link to Fregia’s petition on its Facebook page and supported the building’s name change.
“The 5,500 lb. globe on top of VKC represents the density of globalization at USC, and the building’s 108 flags represent the cultural diversity of USC’s student population,” USG wrote in its Facebook post. “Dr. Von KleinSmid’s beliefs and actions were antonymous to the idea of cultural diversity.”
The petition also said that several universities across the country are “beginning to recognize the significance of historical building names.” According to the petition, these buildings have been named after people who have maintained ties to slavery or groups like the Ku Klux Klan, and are currently in the process of getting renamed.
“I think that a lot of this kind of dissent was like with the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments that caused recent debate for townspeople to say, ‘What are we exactly naming our monuments for? Do they reflect our modern values?’” Fregia said.
Fregia said that before he plans to involve the administration, he hopes the petition will receive more traction as he believes many others at USC care about this issue.
“There is no meeting or serious meeting with administration unless I can produce some type of data,” Fregia said. “Something that shows [that] this is what the student body wants. Even if I do that, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they are going to take it seriously.”
Following the petition’s release, the University did not respond to immediate request for comment by the Daily Trojan.

Last month, USC President C. L. Max Nikias announced that the University had begun a $270 million restoration project and partnership with United Airlines to rename the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum come August 2019. In addition to the change in name, the stadium will be getting new seats, screens, concession stands and box seats. While the Coliseum has undergone a number of renovations throughout its history, this marks the first renaming of the Coliseum since its inception in 1923. 
Nikias’ announcement did not sit particularly well with USC students, alumni and the surrounding community. This is because the renaming of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum marks a shift in values. Namely, by changing the name of a city’s cultural and historical landmark to the symbol of a corporate sponsorship, USC is sending the message that civic spaces and the history and tradition that come with them can be bought.
The connection between sports and advertising is no secret. Sports venues such as the STAPLES Center, the AT&T Stadium and CenturyLink Field are named after brands. Most college football bowl games that used to be known solely as the Orange Bowl and the Cotton Bowl, for example, are now the Capital One Orange Bowl and Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. In the wake of this year’s Super Bowl, especially, where the halftime show is now the Pepsi Halftime Show and companies shell out millions of dollars for 30 seconds of air time, one can see that corporations bring huge amounts of money into sports.
However, just because this connection between sports and marketing is well-established doesn’t mean that it signifies progress of any kind. For nearly a century, the Coliseum has been established as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It has borne witness to multiple Summer Olympics, the World Series and countless NFL and USC football games. It is part of the history of Los Angeles, hence the current name, and is a civic space where Angelenos can come together. Why throw such a meaningful name and civic space away for new seats?
As USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann, explained, the partnership with United Airlines and the consequential name change were necessary in order for the stadium’s renovations to be completed. He said, “If we’re not changing and moving forward, then we’re stagnant and other schools will pass us up, and we won’t be relevant in terms of our facilities.” 
To be clear, the renovations of the Coliseum consist in part of new seats, luxury suites and new lighting and concession stands. It is hard to believe that this partnership was the only fundraising option for a school with USC’s financial means.
As USC football coach Clay Helton said of the project, “It just shows the investment the community and the University is making.” Perhaps for the budgetary aspects of USC, this is a smart investment, but it doesn’t exactly seem like the members of the community are reflected in the “United Airlines Memorial Coliseum.” In fact, it’s almost the opposite. USC is privatizing a civic space that, up until this point, was meant to act as a symbol of the city and its population.
While it is important to have better facilities in the stadium, it is also important to remain loyal to the years of history that are represented in the Coliseum. It should feel like it belongs to the people of Los Angeles, not United Airlines, a company that notably faced serious legal consequences and social media backlash less than a year ago for a circulated video showing United workers forcibly removing passengers from an overbooked flight. 
Perhaps there would have been a better way to fund luxury suites and new lighting that didn’t involve changing the name of a beloved stadium. Perhaps not. Either way, this was the decision that USC had to make: “progress” and money-making versus integrity and upholding tradition.
 In committing to the terms of this paid partnership with United Airlines despite the moral costs, USC has made it clear that they have made their decision and have demeaned the importance of civic spaces such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the process.

In many ways, times have changed since the 1990s. Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center began tracking men’s rights groups on their hate group watch list in an important move toward recognizing misogyny as, well, hateful. In the past few months, the #MeToo movement has given both a platform and varying forms of justice to survivors of sexual abuse, where a too often fickle, arbitrary legal system repeatedly fails them. However gradually, we’ve moved toward recognizing sexism as a continuous issue — one that’s persisted beyond the 19th amendment and Roe v. Wade — and one that still requires remedy.
Entering March, we come to the 20th anniversary of the notorious Starr investigation into sexual misconduct by former President Bill Clinton. This transformed 24-year-old former White House intern Monica Lewinsky into a household name, and this month, Lewinsky’s story is made relevant once again, but with the refreshing twist of a new, feminist cultural context. 
Lewinsky commemorated the anniversary of the notorious 1998 report on her extramarital affair with Clinton with a poignant, thoughtful first-person piece for Vanity Fair’s March issue. 
The essay places her experiences in context with #MeToo, and her story reads as hauntingly prophetic of today’s movement. Hers is, at its core, the story of a man exploiting his power to take advantage of a young, inexperienced woman — a young woman with high aspirations, but no connections with which to offer her options or protection, rendering her vulnerable to a predatorial male superior. The consensual nature of Lewinsky’s relationship with Clinton makes her experiences distinctly different from the stories of Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein and his laundry list of alleged victims. But nonetheless, it is a story of exploitation and vastly unequal power dynamics. 
Some may argue Lewinsky’s story was less about misogyny and more about the age-old political witch hunt, far more of an attack on Clinton and the Democratic Party than Lewinsky herself. But in framing her story in these terms, we reduce Lewinsky to mere collateral damage, to an object without name, without identity, without humanity. 
In her essay, she describes a recent, chance run-in with Kenn Starr, the special prosecutor who investigated Lewinsky and Clinton’s relationship. Starr’s work involved ceaselessly terrorizing and threatening Lewinsky and her family while investigating the affair, in the pursuit of any information that could be used to humiliate Clinton. In his quest, he paid no mind to the trauma that his report would indefinitely exact on a young, private woman. All those years later, she said he looked at her and barely recognized her; through all the months of his investigation, perhaps he had never quite been conscious that Lewinsky was, in fact, a real person. 
What followed was years of bullying and slut-shaming, of hateful and compassion-less narratives from people of all political affiliations. Her experiences were woven into a culture in which young women were allowed no room for mistakes, but in contrast, the mistakes of older, more powerful men would fall neatly on women’s shoulders. 
Nonetheless, Lewinsky moved on and, unlike many of the far-right conspirators who had tormented her (and subsequently joined forces once again on then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign), she grew up; she found her voice as a writer and her passion as an anti-bullying activist. She found humor, compassion and, in a new feminist age, she found support. Now, 20 years after the Starr report, she finds herself an inspirational figure to young women like me. 
I have a strong affinity for the more traditional feminist role models, for Hillary Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Gloria Steinem and all of the many other women who have raised their voices, single-handedly defied a political order and faced unmeasurable backlash and hatred in doing so. But in Lewinsky, I find someone I can relate to with all my own imperfections. Whenever I read her essays, I find myself whisked away to my own experiences; I think of harassment, of hearing the words “they don’t believe sluts” and internalizing that idea — that my voice didn’t matter because of how people viewed me; I think of threats to share topless photos of me and I think of a principal who told me in sweet, reassuring tones that often young men didn’t know better, that they needed second chances.
And every now and then, I hear the question, “why are you a feminist?” directed at me, and moments before ultimately stringing together some simple, palatable answer centered around equality and justice, I think of my own experiences, but still don’t have the strength to repeat them. In that vein, there is so much I respect about Lewinsky, but perhaps most of all, I respect how she lived out her trauma on the world stage — granted, not of her own accord — and over the years has transformed it into something beautiful and powerful. I think of what so many young women are too often forced to experience just to find our voices, the things we care about, believe in and fight for. There was no #MeToo when Lewinsky was a White House intern, or even when I was in high school.
But today, there is. And that changes everything.

In an epic home opener at Merle Norman Stadium against a pair of beach volleyball powerhouses —Pepperdine and UCLA — the Trojans fell on the wrong side of both nail-biting matches 3-2. 
Freshman Haley Hallgren (above) won both of her matches with her teammate freshman Sammy Slater. Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan
The clash between three of the nation’s top programs was one to remember, as the Trojans fought hard but came just short. 
Both matches came down to third sets in the teams’ final matchups with both teams anxiously watching their final duos play. Unfortunately for the Trojans, both matches ended in losses leading to the end of their 16-game winning streak.
Against UCLA, the Trojans split the fourth and fifth courts. On the fourth court, USC seniors Jo Kremer and Jenna Belton defeated UCLA freshman Mac May and sophomore Savvy Simo 21-12 and 21-15. The fifth court saw UCLA junior Izzy Carey and freshman Megan Muret defeat USC freshman Maja Kaiser and graduate student Alexandra Poletto 21-12 and 21-12.
On the second court, USC sophomore Joy Dennis and junior Brianna Sizemore dropped their match 21-11 and 21-18, while freshmen Haley Hallgren and Sammy Slater won their match 21-19 and 21-18, setting up a showdown of both team’s No. 1s to decide the dual. 
In the deciding match, UCLA juniors Megan and Nicole McNamara downed senior Terese Cannon and junior Abril Bustamante 21-17 and 21-18 to lock down the victory for the visiting Bruins. 
Against the Pepperdine Waves, the Trojans started off strong with the fifth court team of Kaiser and Poletto defeating juniors Nikki Lyons and Kaity Bailey 21-19 and 21-16. However, soon after, the Trojans were put on the ropes. 
On the fourth court, Pepperdine’s junior Skylar Caputo and freshman Alexis Filippone defeated Belton and Kremer 19-21, 25-23, 15-12 and the first court match saw freshman Brook Bauer and junior Madalyn Roh defeat Cannon and Bustamante 21-19 and 21-18. 
After the third court duo of Hallgren and Slater were able to overcome the Waves in three thrilling sets (21-14, 16-21 and 17-15) and keep USC’s hopes alive, both squads turned their attentions to court two where Dennis and Sizemore were locked in a tight battle against Pepperdine senior Corinne Quigle and sophomore Deahna Kraft. After splitting two thrilling sets (21-18, 19-21), Sizemore and Dennis eventually dropped the third 15-13 and the Waves’ celebration began.
After two tough losses, head coach Anna Collier said that today can be used as a learning experience
“We learned a lot,” Collier said. “If we don’t learn from this and grow, this was all for nothing. You’ll learn more from losing than you ever will from winning.”
Collier also said that while the passing of the team left something to be desired in her eyes, she said she was happy with how the team adjusted to their new roles and that one or two plays could have changed the result. 
“We have to pass better,” she said. “I think if we can do that better, we’ll be fine. I don’t think they did anything that was that special, we just have to finish better.”
Despite the losses, Collier praised the team’s tenacity and their willingness to adjust to a new year. 
“We’re all playing different positions because we have new, young team,” she said. “That’s difficult to do and I thought they embraced that.”
The Trojans will look to bounce back in Malibu on Saturday where they will take on both Pepperdine and UCLA again in the Zuma Classic.

The USC Men’s volleyball team will host No. 15 UC Santa Barbara on Thursday evening. 
True freshman setter Chris Hall has recorded 368 assists over 14 games in his first season sporting cardinal and gold. Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
USC is coming off a tough loss last Saturday night to No. 13 Grand Canyon University. In a close 2-3 match, the Trojans played with more effort and sense of urgency, with every match being decided by five or fewer points, but still could not close the deal. Not only was it GCU’s first ever victory over USC, but it was also their first win as a member of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. 
Redshirt senior middle blocker Ashton King led the way with 17 kills, nine blocks and six digs while hitting .583. Senior outside hitter Shalev Saada also recorded double-digit kills (13) along with two digs and three blocks. True freshman outside hitter Trevor Weary played in his third game of the season and responded with five kills, five digs and seven blocks. 
For the Trojans, the junior outside trio of Ryan Moss, Gianluca Grasso and Jack Wyett carried the team as per usual. Moss had 16 kills and 14 digs, while Grasso also had 16 kills and served five aces. Wyett had a relatively tame game by his standards with just nine kills and three blocks. Freshman middle blocker Kyle Gear had the strongest game of his career with five kills and 10 blocks. 
Looking forward, UC Santa Barbara is hoping to start the month off strong after an average 2-2 month of February. Their last game was a well-deserved 3-2 win over UC San Diego. Sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders put up 21 kills and a career high nine digs in a match that saw the Gauchos as a team hit .419. Sophomore libero Grady Yould enjoyed his fifth double-digit performance of the season while also tying his career high of 18 scoops. Redshirt sophomore Brandon Hooper chipped in with seven kills and five blocks. The two teams will meet for a rematch following UCSB’s matchup with USC.
With about 40 percent of the season remaining, the Trojans now find themselves with an extremely disappointing 4-12 record. 
Head coach Jeff Nygaard, however, does not seem too discouraged. “The focus for us is the same thing as it’s been the whole time,” Nygaard said. “Which is to become the best team that we can. We’re buying into exactly the process and we’re starting to see internally quite a few of the changes that we want to see with the cultural change.”
The Trojans have quite a youthful team, with 12 out of 19 of their players being underclassman. “Even with the record we have, I see a bunch of young men are still learning and shining with some of the pride that they have knowing full well they’re getting better on a day to day basis … with a developmental mindstep,” Nygaard said.
He also praised his upperclassman for their leadership. “Getting into the comfort zone of saying what needs to be said when it needs to be said,” he said. On the Gauchos, Nygaard added, “They’re intelligent with a high IQ. We have to master our side of the net … and take care of the ball.”
It will be interesting to see if USC’s development continues with a much-needed victory come Thursday evening.

There are few events as overhyped and dramatized in sports as the NFL Draft Combine, where, for four days, NFL scouts, GMs and coaches drool over prospects while fans and media overreact and nit pick the good and bad in everything.
This year’s combine, which begins Friday in Indianapolis, will be no different, as the 2018 draft class sports a gluttony of high-profile quarterbacks that include UCLA’s Josh Rosen, Wyoming’s Josh Allen, Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma State’s Mason Rudolph and, of course, USC’s Sam Darnold. 
Thanks to Darnold, the first mini-controversy of the week has already sprouted. On Tuesday, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Darnold will not throw at the combine. Instead, he will spend his time doing athletic tests and interviews, and he’ll be the first high-end quarterback to not throw at the combine since 2014, when Johnny Manziel and Teddy Bridgewater abstained from passing drills.
The reason for this is calculated. If he showed off his arm at the combine, he would have been compared to the other quarterbacks in the loaded class — some of whom are better passers from the pocket than Darnold is. Darnold’s strength is not the same as that of Rosen or Allen’s, who fit more of the prototypical drop-back-and-throw type of quarterback. 
Where Darnold shines is his ability to improvise, scrambling away from pressure and running in the open field. This is where he gains first downs with his feet or bides his time until a receiver opens up. But there is no drill or test at the combine that would simulate the in-game chaos that Darnold thrives in.
In addition, it’s no secret that Darnold is prone to interceptions. He had 13 last season, when turnovers were a weekly occurrence. He improved his throws marginally toward the back end of the regular season, when he finally found a rhythm with USC’s young receivers. But at the combine, he would be throwing to receivers he has never thrown to before, opening up the risk of off-target passes and more criticism about his arm. 
Despite an up-and-down 2017 campaign, Darnold’s hype train is still in full throttle. Darnold is projected by many mock drafts to be the top selection, so he has more to lose than gain with full participation. He would need a great performance to outshine the arms of Rosen or Allen. If he underwhelms, he may see his draft stock slide.
It does put more pressure for Darnold to impress when he goes through individual team workouts and at USC’s Pro Day on March 21. But at least the environment will be more controlled, and at Pro Day, he’ll be throwing to familiar targets.
Moreover, the combine should not be about Darnold and the other top prospects in the draft. There is plenty of tape, plenty of games that NFL teams can review. A majority of Darnold’s career at USC was broadcast on national television. At this point, we know what he can and can’t do, where his strengths and weaknesses lie. Every little aspect of his game has already been scrutinized and broken down. Another day of passing drills shouldn’t change much. 
This is the right decision for Darnold, whose focus should be on making a solid impression at private meetings with teams. Hue Jackson, the head coach of the Cleveland Browns — who own the first and fourth selections — has already said he doesn’t mind Darnold not throwing.
“We wish he’d throw, but there’s going to be other times to watch him work out,” Jackson said. “That’s not going to hinder us making a decision about what kind of player he is.”
There used to be a time when every top prospect would participate in the combine. But it’s a different age now, an age where players are taking it upon themselves to make decisions that are best for them. You see it in the multitude of stars who skip meaningless bowl games, not wanting to risk injury and their NFL careers. Now, this is Darnold, making a decision that may not please people outside of his circle, but is what he sees as the best option for himself.
