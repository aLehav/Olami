Christopher Lo-Records, a graduate student studying public policy, introduced a resolution Tuesday night at the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting calling for USC to join the Syria Consortium of the Institution for International Education. Joining the consortium would entail offering resources and funding to people “fleeing persecution, torture and death.” Lo-Records said that this would be in line with practices of American universities that date back to World War II, when they provided sanctuary to notable scholars such as Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein.
Lo-Records argued that this was an “issue of morality” and provided background on the Syrian Civil War.
“We are now in the fifth year of the Syrian Civil War, [over] 200,000 people have died this far in this conflict and 4.2 million have been displaced outside of the country,” Lo-Records said.
Lo-Records also highlighted that the 4.2 millions refugees were “not a monolith,” but comprised a diverse group of Arab Sunni Muslims, Kurdish Sunni Muslims, Christians of multiple denominations and secularists, such as agnostics and atheists.
The Syria Consortium, founded in 2012 by the IIE in partnership with the Clinton Foundation, has brought several universities on board, including Bard College, Boston University, Colorado State University and the Illinois Institute of Technology.
The resolution presented by Lo-Records was written in September as response to news reports that these universities — inside and outside the United States — were opening their doors to refugee students and scholars from Syria. Lo-Records pointed out that these measures have taken place in previous decades, when the United States took in refugee scholars from Cuba, Vietnam, Nicaragua and Iraq.
“This resolution has absolutely nothing to with national security or politics,” Lo-Records said. “All students who come to the United States are subject to security checks by the State Department, not by universities.”
Lo-Records explained that the security process is a long one, ranging from 18 to 24 months, and has been successful in taking in 750,000 refugees since 9/11, none of whom have been charged with domestic terrorism.
Sen. Aaron Rifkind questioned Lo-Records on whether this resolution could be divorced from the current political situation unfolding in the wake of the Paris attacks.
“I appreciate that you are trying to remove the politics from this,” Rifkind said, “but The Huffington Post and the New York Times both have headlines right now that relate to this. Don’t you think they are intrinsically tied?”
Lo-Records responded that the formulation of this resolution was removed from the political issues that are in the news right now.
“The issue that is in the news right now is the conflation of refugees [with] terrorists, and the fundamental issue that launched this was [the consortium] of more than 50 universities in the United States having already done this in the past five years,” Lo-Records said.

Written prayers left at the Little Chapel of Silence were burned at a ritual ceremony Tuesday night. Members of the USC community gathered at the University Religious Center courtyard to read aloud several of the written prayers before they were set alight.
The ceremony is held once or twice a year by the USC Interfaith Council and the Office of Religious Life to allow students to come together and share their struggles and challenges in solidarity. This is the sixth year that the ceremony has been held.
“We have so many of these prayers, and we didn’t know what to do with them, so we talked to the Interfaith Council … we decided on reading them and burning them,” said Jim Burklo, associate dean of religious life.
Tal Volk
The Little Chapel of Silence, tucked behind the northwest corner of Town & Gown, has been an open room for people of all faiths to go for silent contemplation and prayer since 1935.
The prayers come from both members and non-members of the USC community who have visited the Little Chapel of Silence and left a prayer. The prayers read at the ceremony covered a wide range of topics and emotions.
Burklo has been touched by the prayers left at the box.
“The prayers come from different religious traditions, they’re written in many different languages and they reflect the range of human emotions,” Burklo said. “It is very touching to experience the power of these prayers and expressions as they are shared aloud.”
After the burning of the prayers, several of the attendees were treated to hot chocolate, marshmallows and a bonfire that lasted through the evening. The event allowed students to warm up from the cold and relieve stress while listening to heartfelt prayers.
“It’s a nice kind of winding down event … it’s actually cold and dark, and that’s a really powerful thing this time of the year,” said Joe Russ, president of the Interfaith Council.
According to Burklo, burning prayers is symbolic of raising something to a higher level and releasing it. The prayers read on Tuesday came from people of different ages and backgrounds and dealt with a range of subjects, from hoping for the football team to win to overcoming financial struggle.
“We have people who don’t go to USC write prayers sometimes. We have high school students saying, ‘I want to go to USC’ on some of these prayers,” Russ said.
Angie Mendoza, a junior majoring in social sciences, was involved in reading the prayers before they were burned.
“It was very beautiful to share in the struggles for a moment and release them out in the world,” Mendoza said.
Being somewhat removed from view of pedestrians, it is rare for students to know about this small chapel. No regular services are held; however, visitors are encouraged to write a small prayer on a piece of paper and place it in a box regardless of their religious affiliation.
“We are all going through a lot of different things and passages in our lives, and you’re reading about all these passages in these prayers. You get a whole sense of the community, its joys, its struggles, its challenges and its successes, and there is a whole lot of connectedness to the campus,” Burklo said. “This is the ultimate Trojan Family experience.”

Medable and the Center for Body Computing have created Biogram 2, a program that is helping researchers study health on a global scale. The program allows users to share photos and post their heart rate through Apple’s ResearchKit, which will allow USC researchers to examine anonymous heart rates and understand health all over the world.
The program was announced on Oct. 9 at the USC Body Computing Conference.
Biogram’s interface is similar to Instagram, but instead of posting photos, users are asked to include their heart rate.
Leslie Saxon, cardiologist at the Keck School of Medicine and executive director for USC Center for Body Computing, said that Biogram 2 is one of the ways in which we can collect biometric data on a large scale and sense if users will become sick.
“One of the ways we can start to make fundamental breakthroughs in healthcare is by collecting biometric data in large so we can really understand major public health issues and events,” Saxon said. “We can also help people predict when they are going to get sick.”
Biogram 2 was created through a partnership between Medable and USC Center for Body Computing. Medable provided a compliant platform for the app that integrates Biogram 2 with Apple Health and ResearchKit.
Ingrid Oakley-Girvan, Medable chief scientific officer, sees the importance in making healthcare a natural experience.
“The goal is to utilize something that people are already doing in posting photos, and to capture them in the moment so it is a natural non-additional experience,” Oakley-Girvan said. “Part of changing health is getting an active buy-in through an emotional connection.”
Saxon is captivated by the research that she is doing on large-scale healthcare and excited because of the connection she will have with the community.
“I am fascinated by young people contributing to biometrics because it is an interesting and cool aesthetic and emotional content,” she said. “It’s basically me observing my kids and friends — I think this is the future.”
Beyond publishing an initial study which aims to understand the health of a global population, Saxon hopes to use this biometric data to help people educate themselves about their own health and draw correlation between photo sharing and heart rate.
“It will be a fascinating way to connect with the community and do cutting-edge research,” Saxon said. “I’m interested in how heart rate reflects how people feel about sharing and how others respond [by liking posts].”
Oakley-Girvan is especially interested in how data analytics will shape the future of healthcare, as correlations can help give people insight into their own health and empower them.
“One of the eventual goals is to arm people with scientific information to help their own health,” Oakley-Girvan said. “This empowerment allows individuals to make better health choices.”
If patients want to lose weight, they could use data to see what activities constitute weight loss and weight gain and to make informed choices and change their lifestyle. That is one of the future goals of this study, explained Oakley-Girvan, while the heart rate data is more of an immediate goal.
“It’s more about the person sharing their photo with the heart rate,” she said. “They are also providing information on satisfaction with personal relationships and how many people share it.”
Using social media to study biometric data is a breakthrough research method. It allows researchers to use the power of social media to the benefit of society.
“[Biogram 2] is the first one out there,” Oakley-Girvan said. “Social media is a pervasive element in our lives, and it’s something that we do naturally. We are harnessing social media to improve people’s health.”
Medable, the platform that Biogram 2 uses, is also a revolution in application development. It uses a full stack of development pieces to reduce development time and needs to fulfill its mission to provide medical apps which improve health.
“Our primary goal is to facilitate medical grade apps to improve health,” Oakley-Girvan said. “We provide a full stack of development pieces — data, back end, analytics and app functionality.”
Biogram 2 is now available on the App Store. It requires that you sign up with your name and email and answer a basic survey that helps with the analysis of coded health data. Those enrolled in the study must post a photo and heart rate data point at least once a day and participate in surveys at the beginning and end of the study.
Saxon urged USC students to take part in the study to advance the concept of social media and biometric health data.
“I hope Trojans get behind it and advance the science and concept of how powerful the social community can be,” Saxon said.

Women’s basketball junior guard Courtney Jaco wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to get ready for morning practice, after which she attends classes for the majority of the day, before finally getting the chance to eat, study and sleep. Last season, Jaco appeared in all 30 basketball games, while earning Pac-12 All-Academic Honorable Mention last season.
For Jaco and the rest of the roughly 550 student-athletes at USC, juggling academics with practice, traveling around the country and competing in intercollegiate sports is just part of daily life. Over time, this wear and tear on the mind and body can lead to stress. Student-athletes face many of the same mental health risk factors as their non-athlete peers, but can also be exposed to an additional set of risk factors such as time demands and performance pressures, according to the NCAA.
USC, though, has made it a priority to assist its student-athletes in managing these pressures. In his August 2015 report, Athletic Director Pat Haden said one of his guiding principles for the Athletics Department is to continue helping students find the balance in their lives among the challenges of academics, competitions and the social life of a college student.
Former USC baseball preferred walk-on player and junior C.J. Angle was part of the team during the fall of both his freshman and sophomore year, but was cut before the start of the season both times, due to injuries.
According to Angle, almost every athlete at USC comes from a high school where he or she was the best player on the team and most likely the leader on the team. The athletes are then made to transition to a Division I environment where they are surrounded by athletes with the same, or even higher, skill set.
“The fact that I didn’t have a secure spot on the team is what really stressed me out,” Angle said. “I would worry about doing my best to impress the coaches every time I stepped on the field instead of playing the game I love and doing the best I could no matter what happened.”
Being a student-athlete can have its advantages, however, when it comes to establishing a fixed routine to follow daily.
“To be honest, I felt that because my life was so structured with a set schedule, I was able to adequately get my work done without being too stressed,” Angle said. “I knew exactly when I needed to get work done, and it really helped my organizational skills.”
Angle now serves on the Undergraduate Student Government’s Wellness Affairs committee and advocates for the importance of student-athletes to remain stress-free, despite the hurdles that may come with athletics, such as injuries.
“Of course there were times when exhaustion kicked in and the stress of baseball itself was getting to me, but it’s something you just learn to deal with and get through,” Angle said.
At an institution with the academic rigor of USC, there can be a great deal of pressure for student-athletes to keep up in the classroom while managing equally high expectations on the field.
Freshman linebacker Cameron Smith, who enrolled at USC last spring, said he uses football as his primary motivator for doing well in the classroom.
“It’s important to be mentally tough and getting through it so I can play football,” Smith said. “You have to grind through it, and I love the grind.”
Based on higher GPAs and the academic progress from student-athletes, it seems like many are putting the student aspect of the phrase student-athlete first and foremost. In the spring 2015 semester, student-athletes’ average semester GPA increased to a 3.00, the highest it’s been since  2000, when the information was first recorded.
This improvement can be attributed to the many different resources offered by USC’s Student-Athlete Academic Services Program. This program includes providing student-athletes additional services such as tutors in order to assist them in fulfilling their full academic potential.
Last spring, the football team notched its highest semester GPA (2.71) and cumulative GPA (2.52) ever. The team’s most recent academic progress rate (2013-2014), which was released by the NCAA last spring, also rose seven points to 948, though it remains below the national average of 956.
“Balancing football and academics is simple for me,” said redshirt senior defensive lineman Antwaun Woods. “I’ve been here for five years now, so I don’t have a big academic load, but I’m glad because this year, with everything we’ve been going through, I couldn’t imagine how the other guys have been doing it.”
A few players said that striking the balance between football and school can be much tougher in the fall with the team holding practice daily and also having to travel to away games, which can force players to miss a significant amount of class time.
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is considered “superman” on the football field, leading the Pac-12 Conference in receiving with over 1,100 yards this season. But Smith-Schuster said balancing that on-field success with his coursework hasn’t always been easy.
“It has been really tough,” Smith-Schuster, a human biology major, said. “The classes that I scheduled are some pretty tough classes. But, I did it last year and I thought it was harder as a freshman coming here and not knowing what major I was going to be and how my football career was going to turn out.”
In October 2014, the Pac-12 also implemented landmark reforms to increase athletic scholarships to include the full cost of attendance, guarantee four-year athletic scholarships and increase medical coverage for student-athletes.
Varsity student-athletes, however, aren’t the only ones on campus who have to deal with the dilemma of balancing sports and school. The Recreational Club Council at USC oversees 57 club sports and is composed of more than 2,500 student-athletes. Many of them share the same dilemmas as Division I student-athletes but with fewer perks.
These perks can range from the financial security of athletic scholarships to meals to tutors and a central facility to study in the John McKay Center.
Since USC doesn’t have a Division I men’s soccer team, Ian Anderson, a sophomore majoring in business administration, plays on the men’s club soccer team at USC and said playing a sport has benefits for stress and time management. Studies conducted by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have shown that exercise, such as participating in competitive athletics, can relieve stress, reduce depression and improve cognitive function.
“It isn’t too stressful because the exercise I get from practice relieves stress, and I use practice as a break from study sessions,” Anderson said. “To me it’s ultimately beneficial for school work.”

As the end of the semester approaches, students campuswide are burying themselves in books and cramming for exams. And the barrage of tests, papers and assignments is accompanied by the stress and depression of students trying to achieve academic excellence.
But for students of color, final exams are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to sources of stress on campus.
Minority students face a unique set of challenges that affect their mental health according to Hannah Nguyen, director of Academic Culture Assembly.
“While stress from exams and assignments does take a toll on all students’ mental health, some students have to deal with feeling unsafe to speak up in class or feeling underrepresented by the authors on their syllabus,” said Nguyen, who spearheaded the effort to create USC’s Mental Health Awareness Month in October.
These microaggressions, brief everyday remarks that attack one’s racial identity, can manifest into trauma, explained assistant professor Shanea Thomas, and, as a result, have profound implications for mental health.
“You feel like you’re in a constant state of fight or flight all the time, and your body is not meant to live in a constant state of fear,” Thomas said. “That really wears on mental health, so that’s why in communities of color you have such high rates of hypertension and blood pressure and depression.”
But while students of color have a uniquely heightened experience with mental health, these issues are often made invisible. In the Asian Pacific American community, Nguyen said, that’s due to a perception that Asian Americans are the “model minority.”
“We are expected to be high-performing and, on top of everything, putting up the facade that we are highly successful and alpha people,” Nguyen said. “It’s like, ‘Oh, you’re Asian American, you’re supposed to be able to do all this.’ It erases the validity of a person’s mental health.”
For Latino students, said Mirian Fuentes, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, mental health is also often not spoken about. Rather, Latino students today are told to “toughen up,” which can deter them from seeking professional help.
“Seeing counselors is a little ridiculous for some families because it’s like, ‘Why do you need to talk to another person?’” Fuentes said. “In a white community, it’s perfectly normal. But in a Latino community, it’s kind of absurd.”
Diana Jimenez, executive director for Program Board, said this phenomenon may occur in part because of older generations’ collective experiences.
“I think about everything my grandparents had to endure, like getting their land taken away — even in the ’60s, their land taken away — their culture being erased and them not being able to speak the dialects that they are native to in order to conform to a society that didn’t even want them,” Jimenez said. “Coming to this University, I’ve seen everything that my family and my ancestors had to go through to be where we are now, so I can’t complain.”
Moreover, for Latino students, many of whom are first-generation college students, a different set of pressures arises.
“A lot of us have held previous jobs, and although some of us may not have gone to super rigorous high schools, we overcame a lot of financial barriers and a lot of institutionalized barriers to even be here,” Jimenez said.
Different minority groups often face pressures from different types  of external forces. For black students, police brutality can profoundly affect mental health, said Kalan Leaks, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering.
“It’s almost like an innate thing that the black community is seen as these angry, vicious people,” Leaks said. “There’s a video every week of a person being [hurt] due to a perception of danger — not any actual danger whatsoever … So that makes me feel like I have to do extra things just to live.”
The perception of the black community as angry or violent leads to a greater feeling of invalidation that can profoundly affect mental health, Leaks said.
“So having these narratives pushed down upon you for such a long time, they eventually start creating that negative loop,” Leaks said. “People don’t go crazy in a vacuum.”
For black students and students of color alike, internalizing racism can be traumatic. And collectively, the unique challenges that students of color face on campus can be overwhelming.
“I think, on this campus, students of color, and marginalized students in general, burn out so much faster,” Nguyen said. “We have to bear the brunt of feeling constantly attacked and unsafe and invalidated and demeaned for who we are.”
Jimenez emphasized that self-care is essential for students of color to reclaim their narratives and take agency of their mental health.
“To be able to engage in that self-care is resistance in itself, and I think that’s the beauty of it,” she said.

Vanessa Diaz was scribbling notes for her “African Diaspora” class last semester when her professor stopped and made an informal announcement to the room.
“If it’s too much,” he said, “you don’t have to look at it.”
The lecture that day was to be centered on the historical lynchings of African Americans in the United States, coupled with graphic images and detailed narratives of the individuals killed. The professor made it clear that if any students wanted to excuse themselves, they had the right to.
The professor’s precaution, though small, is indicative of a growing trend in the college classroom of implementing trigger warnings: verbal or written disclaimers meant to warn students of potentially distressing material preceding its dissemination.
While originating as a means to predominantly protect students who have previously experienced trauma, the practice’s effects are now causing a tug-of-war between the needs of a professor’s academic freedom and those of students’ well-being.
“Students have the right not to be traumatized in the classroom,” said Diaz, a junior majoring in American studies and executive co-director of USC’s Women’s Student Assembly. “The trigger warning in the syllabus from class that day had me prepared. I walked in knowing what I was getting into and knowing beforehand that I could deal with it.”
Diaz and other student advocates of trigger warnings encourage their utility at universities as a safe way to prevent mental health relapses in the classroom, and some members of the faculty agree.
Leslie Berntsen, a teaching assistant for introductory psychology classes and chair of the TA Fellows program at the Center for Excellence in Teaching, uses trigger warnings in her discussions. She said reaction is overwhelmingly positive, and that students have emailed her after class, thanking her for the “heads up” before particularly sensitive topics.
“I don’t think there’s anything particularly radical about [trigger warnings],” Berntsen said. “It’s not a huge deal, my academic freedom has never been threatened, my classroom has not combusted.”
Nevertheless, the fear among faculty is there, and not all share Bernsten’s enthusiasm. Anthony Sparks, now a professor at California State University, Fullerton, was Diaz’s African Diaspora professor. He said that his decision in class that day was more an exception to the rule than a common practice, and in general, he finds the idea of trigger warnings debilitating to the classroom.
“For me, a trigger warning is more wrapped up in comforting a student — making them comfortable at all times — versus providing context and giving the student a framework in order to view, encounter or discuss the material,” he said. “There’s a difference between the two.”
Similarly, Alison Trope, clinical professor of communication and director of undergraduate studies in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, thinks that students should have the right to excuse themselves if they are especially affected by course material, but doesn’t believe trigger warnings should be required on teacher’s syllabi. For her, the practice is treating a symptom of a larger problem: a need for greater cultural competency and sensitivity among faculty and students.
“A trigger warning should not be necessary if, as members of an academic community, we can be sensitive and empathetic partners in an ongoing dialogue,” she wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Trope and Sparks aren’t alone on campus in their hesitations. Trope, who is also co-chair of the newly formed Academic Senate Committee on Campus Climate, said the topic has not been discussed explicitly within the committee but notes there are strong sentiments among faculty — both at USC and nationwide — concerning the cost of trigger warnings.
“The main hesitation faculty have (important caveat … this is not ALL faculty, nor is this limited to USC) is twofold,” Trope wrote. “Trigger warnings are seen as a potential threat to academic freedom. And, related, they are characterized (or mischaracterized in some cases) as ‘coddling’ students.”
These two points are the most frequently cited reasons against trigger warnings, most notably in the idea of the practice sheltering students from harmful discourse. An Atlantic cover story last September dubbed “The Coddling of the American Mind,” was an 8,000-word piece deriding the practice as counterintuitive to treating mental health and indicative of an increasingly sensitive generation, and the most notable example of public backlash.
For some students at USC, national outcry from older generations has them both frustrated and on the defensive.
“I was really disappointed [by it],”  said Sophia Li, a junior majoring in law, history and culture and sociology, regarding media coverage maligning trigger warnings. “I usually love The Atlantic, [but] I think it completely missed the point and mischaracterized the point of trigger warnings and the people advocating for them.”
Diaz, too, was thrown off by what she sees as a blatant lack of empathy among critics, and an inability to view those in the classroom in a multidimensional fashion.
“People try to separate the student and the person,” she said. “Logic and emotion don’t exist in binary ways. The idea that we should remove our own experiences is impossible.”
This trend of confusion is common. Those advocating trigger warnings see them as beneficial for those who need them and inconsequential for those who don’t. Questions of academic freedom and student “coddling,” they say, are misinformed and misguided.
“I wish [critics] would take a step back and reflect why they think they’re qualified to determine what people are allowed to be offended by,” Berntsen said. “This entire debate about trigger warnings comes down to basic human empathy. These aren’t radical concepts, but somehow the entire discourse has evolved into something that I don’t understand.”
Here at USC, some of the practice’s most vocal critics have reached campus. At a speaking event hosted by the USC College Republicans in October, journalist Milo Yiannopoulos maligned trigger warnings as an egregious and intolerable offense against the academic culture of a university. Students requesting them, he said, shouldn’t be at college.
“My basic response to this is anyone who wants a trigger warning should be immediately expelled,” Yiannopoulos said. “They’ve demonstrated that they are incapable of completing requirements of their course. They’ve chosen to use slippery and unnecessary tactics based on dodgy cognitive science to suggest that people can’t be exposed to certain ideas because they’re so hurtful or traumatic. All of this is nonsense.”
While not nearly as hyperbolic in tone, there are some students who agree that trigger warnings don’t necessarily belong in an academic setting.
The leading campus student organization on mental health, the USC National Alliance on Mental Illness, or USC NAMI, came out with an official response against trigger warnings in response to this article. The organization cited the practice as harming students’ mental health rather than helping it and allowing for censorship in the classroom. While they said that professors should allow an alternative assignment or excused absence from class if a student specifically asks in advance, they stressed it is the student’s responsibility, not the professor’s, to address the issue.
“NAMI does not support trigger warnings,” the statement read. “Despite the good intentions behind trigger warnings, we believe they would be detrimental to the student population in more ways than one.”
In an interview, USC NAMI co-presidents Steve Navarrete and Rosemarie Wilson expanded that the diversity of mental health illnesses coupled with the professor’s necessity to teach freely makes trigger warnings both burdensome and predominantly unnecessary.
“You can’t possibly warn everyone for something,” Navarrete said. “Where do you draw that line? Where does it become appropriate? It really limits what you can do as a professor, and as a professor you don’t want to be limited. You want to be able to discuss what the world is. That’s exactly what we’re trying to do here as a university, which is to learn, not be censored. Otherwise, what’s the point?”
As of now, there is nothing in existence nor immediately planned at USC to mandate or even encourage professors to issue trigger warnings. But as the dialogue surrounding mental health increases on campuses nationwide, more eyes are shifting to the responsibility of campus educators.
“We’re clearly showing a shift toward mental health at USC, but there’s still more the University could do,” Wilson said. “Professors and faculty members need to be trained better on mental health because a lot don’t know how to respond to crisis.”
Isn’t showing the lynching and murders of these blacks the whole point of taking the class? There is no other way to discover how truly awful and in-human these murderers were, the ones that strung up the blacks sometimes just for being black, other than by showing the result of their actions. It’s like talking about the Holocaust and not showing the piles of bodies at the death camps.
Isnt the point of therapy to help patients come to terms with their traumas in a way that they will not interfere with the patients normal daily life anymore? If someone requires trigger warnings on simple images or even words to function in a society, then his or her therapy has utterly failed.
And Milo is right once again!

Homo sapiens are an obsessively social species. Our brains crave connection, information and stimulation — elements in abundance in the digital age, when devices give us perpetual access to the universe of social media. But in this fast-paced, digitized world, students are feeling the strain of this overstimulation, exemplified by the growing trend of depression, anxiety and stress on college campuses. Now, the Engemann Student Health Center is responding to the latest research in neuroscience by promoting mindfulness and exercise at USC and providing programs to rehabilitate the brain.
Dr. Kelly Greco is the interim assistant director of outreach services at the Engemann Center. She spoke about the latest challenges she and her colleagues face on campus and how in today’s collegiate environment, stressors outpace students’ ability to cope.
“I think with this generation, the amount of stress exceeds someone’s coping skills and what someone can do,” Greco said. “I think a lot of that has to do with social media and technology.”
That the rise in mental illness among college students is in tandem with the rise of social media is no speculation. A wave of studies in the past few years has identified social networking sites, particularly Facebook, as a driver of stress and anxiety in the individual. Many of these studies find that the need for social acceptance through “likes” and other digital forms of approval leads to users feeling dissatisfied and despondent. And the compulsive checking for updates, enabled by constant accessibility, can harm users’ well-being. Greco said the pervasive access in this digital culture leads to sensory overload.
“We get a quick fix and get information quickly, so we can be stimulated a lot more than we could 40 years ago,” she said.
To understand how to restore a brain overstimulated by its environment, it is necessary to investigate the brain’s potential as a dynamic entity. Dr. Giselle Petzinger, researcher at the George and MaryLou Boone Center for Parkinson’s Disease Research at the Keck School of Medicine, outlined the role of physical exercise in shaping the brain.
“We think that what you do for exercise could very well matter,” Petzinger said.
She explained that exercise can impact mental health by “increasing connectivity and making brains more resilient.”
“We have data suggesting that skill-based exercise may ameliorate cognitive-related problems,” Petzinger said. “Mental illness often has cognitive domains affected. Some of the research we’re doing suggest that skill-based exercise, which requires more cognitive engagement, may be particularly useful.”
These skill-based exercises, such as playing tennis or basketball, are preferable to simply running on a treadmill because they engage various circuits of the brain simultaneously.
A shape-shifting biological structure, the brain has enough plasticity to allow it to respond to its environment through chemical and cellular changes. Because of this, the neurological state of individuals is strongly tied to their environment.
“The idea is that enriched environments, in a way, provide lots of contextual information that we use to learn,” Petzinger said. “We need an enriched cognitive environment, and we need some level of variability.”
Experiments with mice reveal the profound effect the environment can have on plasticity, measured by the subject’s versatility and problem-solving skills. Mice in cages with treadmills, plastic tubes and other playful elements had healthier brains — and were better at cognitive tests — than mice confined to “dull,” itemless cages. The challenge posed to neuroscientists like Petzinger and health professionals is bridging the research to the patient, translating the knowledge gained from the laboratory into real-world applications.
Through a variety of workshops, classes and outreach programs, the Engemann Center is bringing the fight to mental illness, ushering in an era of mental health awareness and student rehabilitation. Currently, the Engemann Center offers everything from educational programs to yoga classes to stress fitness workshops — held throughout October and November and featuring stress-relieving tips such as relaxation and improved sleep.
In conjunction with these utilities provided by the Engemann Center, practicing self-awareness and being conscious of one’s use of social media are also important, Greco said.
“I think you have to look at your environment. How much stimulation [is] in those environments?” Greco said. “There’s always chaos around us; there’s always deadlines, demands that impact us on a daily basis. What do we do to manage it is the question for all of us.”
To restore order to a frenetic mind, Greco encourages students to evaluate their relationship with social media, rationing its use whenever possible.
In the culture of connectivity, restraining ourselves from our devices and becoming physically active can be difficult, but the results, Greco said, can be liberating.
“It’s hard to do, but I think it’s going to come around that [people who use social media] are really experiencing the negative parts of it,” Greco said. “I think it’s impacting us more than we think it is.”

“I can’t help you.”
The words sent ice down her spine. Then-junior Kelsey Reinhardt sat across the desk from Dr. TJ Rai, a psychiatrist who was supposed to have all the answers. He was at a loss for words. He didn’t know what to tell her.
Reinhardt had spent seven years hiding — hiding an eating disorder and an addiction to exercise — and she was done. Now, she just wanted to get better. And he was telling her that he couldn’t help.
Rai explained that without inpatient treatment, it would be nearly impossible to administer proper care to Reinhardt. Already underweight, she had lost 10 pounds in the three weeks leading up to sorority recruitment. Every effort she made over the past two years at USC to shed the eating disorder had failed.
To change, Reinhardt needed to get out.
“I was the kid who loved school, who never even thought it was an option to not go to school,” Reinhardt said. “To consider taking a semester off … That was terrifying to me. It just wasn’t done. It wasn’t even on my radar.”
She made the decision on a Friday — she needed a break. That morning, Reinhardt contacted her adviser and began filing for a leave of absence. The next week, she informed each of her professors in person that she was leaving to seek inpatient treatment. She told only a few close friends, then packed her clothes and left her life behind.
That day was the beginning of a transformation for Reinhardt. Now a senior, she credits her ongoing recovery from anorexia and depression to the inpatient treatment she received during her leave of absence.
According to David Glasgow, assistant vice provost for undergraduate programs, 273 undergraduate students take leaves of absence from USC each year. This makes up about 1.4 percent of the undergraduate population. Yet students such as Reinhardt who do take a leave find that this time off has the potential to be life-changing.
For Reinhardt, it was a period of growth, of refocusing. She first developed an eating disorder as a freshman in high school. Throughout high school, her sense of self-worth intertwined itself with the way she viewed her weight.
It didn’t matter how much weight she lost. When Reinhardt looked in the mirror, she saw a body that was still too fat. By the time she came to USC, Reinhardt’s eating disorder was the axis of her life.
“When you have an eating disorder, it’s like another person, someone who’s not you but who controls a huge part of your life,” Reinhardt said. “It was the focus of my life. It gave me control, it gave me this feeling that if I could control this part of who I was, I could succeed.”
In her sophomore year, Reinhardt was depressed and fatigued from malnutrition. In an attempt to improve her situation, Reinhardt threw herself into her academics and her sorority life. But staying busy only made it easier to rationalize the continuation of the disorder that was tearing her apart.
The secret had become too heavy to carry around on a day-to-day basis. During Thanksgiving break, Reinhardt’s parents finally asked what was wrong. She told them everything. They had no way to completely understand what was going on inside their daughter’s brain. But they tried, and Reinhardt loved them for the support they gave.
“With my family, it was a lot of educating at first,” Reinhardt said. “My dad would tell me to just eat more, to just put on some weight. They didn’t have the slightest idea what to do, they just knew that we had to do something, we had to change this.”
What came next was a long series of failed attempts to find a solution.
First, Reinhardt tried a combination of meeting with a dietician and non-specialized therapist for seven months. It wasn’t enough. Reinhardt wasn’t tracking her weight, but she didn’t need to see a number on the scale to know that she wasn’t improving. So she moved on to the next option, intensive outpatient therapy.
Her time in this program lasted for only a week. At the end of the week, the program director told her that there was nothing outpatient treatment could do for Reinhardt. She needed constant monitoring to restructure her eating and exercise habits.
So in October of her sophomore year, Reinhardt left behind her life at USC and checked into Center for Discovery, an intensive inpatient treatment facility.
“I was too far gone at that point,” Reinhardt said. “I needed time where all I was thinking about, all I was focused on, was getting better. I needed time more than anything else.”
Reinhardt left with a single intention — to rid herself of the eating disorder that had dominated the last six years of her life. This is the type of action that is suggested by counselors at the Engemann Health Center when students take a leave of absence.
Dr. Kelly Greco, the Engemann Center’s interim assistant director of outreach services, believes that students should only take the break when their mental health concerns threaten their ability to function as a student. At that time, she hopes that students will use their time off for appropriate therapy or treatment programs.
“It’s critical for the student to be doing what is best in order to return them to a state where they can come back to school and succeed as quickly as possible,” Greco said. “That means surrounding themselves with positive people and seeking whatever treatment they need. It’s a purposeful break.”
Reinhardt’s time off was intentional, exactly as Greco would hope. For three months, she lived alongside other women with eating disorders. At Center for Discovery, every meal was planned. Each day revolved around intense therapy sessions focused on reshaping the way Reinhardt approached her lifestyle.
When she returned to USC in the spring, life felt off-kilter at first, but Reinhardt felt a new sense of motivation. She studied abroad in Italy over the summer and took on the position of vice president of recruitment for her sorority. She stayed healthy. The time off had made its impact.
Though she’s made improvements, Reinhardt emphasizes that she isn’t “fixed.” She’s still working to bring certain foods that she had forbidden herself from eating — french fries, meats — back into her diet. But for Reinhardt, this process would never have started without taking time to focus on her mental health.
Most importantly, Reinhardt is happy now.
“I don’t want to think where I would be today if I hadn’t taken that time off,” Reinhardt said. “It gave me a chance to breathe. I didn’t want the eating disorder, [and] I still don’t want it. I want to be healthy. And you come to a point where you have to choose to put that health ­— that goal of being OK again — you have to put that first.”

Mental health has become a rising concern in higher education, prompting calls for action by students, faculty and administrators across the nation. Though solutions to this issue are few and far between, some USC students are discovering the need for more proactive solutions — some of which already exist on campus.
“It’s great that they have counseling centers, but not every student feels comfortable seeking those out until it’s a dire time of need,” said Katherine Wilcoz, director of External Relations for Undergraduate Student Government. “What we need are more workshops for dealing with stress.”
The significant dearth in proactive approaches to mental and physical health was echoed by Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, who said the steady rise in mental health challenges calls for more creative solutions.
“Often times, this work feels reactive because we only know students are in crisis when they are actually in crisis and they are at the counseling center,” Soni said. “But we also started to think about what a proactive engagement with mental health looks like as well that we can think of as a parallel to what we’re doing reactively, and we came to the idea of mindfulness as part of an overall proactive mental health strategy.”
The concept of mindfulness was unveiled on campus in the fall of 2014 in the form of Mindful USC, a university-wide initiative aimed at promoting mental and physical health for students, faculty and staff in the university community. It is premised on three main components: being awake, open and kind. Soni explained that mindfulness seeks to encourage participants to be aware of themselves and their environment in a way that leads to reduced stress and increased attentiveness, quality of learning and overall creativity and innovation.
“Really what we’re talking about with mindfulness is how to have a healthy relationship with your thoughts and your emotions,” Soni said.
The secular nature of the program and the proven health benefits have helped minimize the stigmatization surrounding the practicality of mindfulness and meditation in enhancing mental and physical health. Of the 800 participants who took part in last year’s Mindful USC program, nine out of 10 reported that the practice has been helpful to their lives.
“What we found was that we didn’t even need to prove the concept,” Soni said. “We just had to provide the resource.”
In its inaugural year, Mindful USC offered 22 free, not-for-credit courses in mindfulness taught by certified instructors. Though the initiative is offering the same number of courses this year, Soni said that more can be done to meet the already overwhelming demand — and it starts with the University’s upcoming USC Village project.
“If we’re going to try to hit every student and cultivate a culture of mindfulness, the best place to do that is through residential education because every first-year student will have the residential education experience moving forward,” Soni said.
Though the USC Village isn’t set for completion until Fall 2017, Mindful USC has already begun a residential education pilot program in the Parkside Arts & Humanities Residential College entitled, “Design Your Life.” The program focuses on three areas encompassing a broad liberal arts education: how to find meaning and purpose in one’s life and career; how to talk about difficult subjects such as race and privilege, as well as how to solve significant global challenges; and how one thinks about emotional intelligence, self-care, wellness and mindfulness.
Though Mindful USC is supported by a faculty-led steering committee in coordination with 12 partners including Student Affairs, Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government, the initiative also boasts a student arm, led by mindfulness practitioner Lillie Moffett.
Moffett, a senior majoring in psychology and cognitive science, first began practicing mindfulness after attending a meditation on campus her freshman year. When the University created the initiative in the fall of her junior year, the Office of Religious Life asked her to spearhead the effort of introducing mindfulness to students. As the student leader of Mindful USC, Moffett said that though the concept is gaining popularity, it’s still largely misunderstood.
“A lot of people think I meditate 45 minutes a day, but I don’t,” Moffett said. “I meditate multiple times a day for very little time. I do it a lot right before I’m about to sit down and do a huge chunk of homework because I’ve found that it really increases my focus.”
To mindfulness leader Zach Manta, a junior majoring in environmental studies, the practice of mindfulness is about learning how to respond to one’s own natural emotions.
“Mindfulness is not really about control — you can’t make yourself feel how you want to feel,” Manta said. “It’s more about riding the waves and being able to navigate your emotions, instead of just controlling them.”
Despite having practiced mindfulness for several years, both Moffett and Manta said it took a long time to grasp the practice. Moffett, who serves as a residential adviser in Parkside Arts & Humanities and leads a mindfulness meditation group for residents, said this learning curve often serves as the greatest deterrent among students.
“Results don’t come right away,” she said. “And [students] feel bad that they can’t focus.”
Manta echoed this, arguing that ignoring the challenges of meditation does not address the reasons why it is challenging.
“It is really difficult [to sit down with your own thoughts],” Manta said. “But at the end of the day, it’s worth doing because your thoughts are affecting you whether or not you’re paying attention to them.”
Time isn’t a problem unique to meditation. Wilcox said added accessibility to other proactive resources will also require a significant time investment.
“As a student myself, I’d rather spend my time doing homework than going to a wellness workshop,” Wilcox said.
In addition to time, Manta also highlighted the importance of finding appropriate spaces for meditation — something he says the University lacks.
“There’s no good, regularly available room open to students where you can just go and meditate and not be judged for doing this weird thing in the middle of an open space without being constantly surrounded by the sound of construction or other students’ conversations,” Manta said.
Though meditation isn’t the only way to achieve mindfulness, Moffett says it is the best practice towards achieving it.
“I see mindfulness as it helps me not react to situations, but to respond to situations,” Moffett said. “Through meditation, it trains me to be mindful in my everyday life.”

On a campus where students are increasingly utilizing mental health resources, USC students are calling for additional support. In 2014, 24 Engemann Student Health Center clinicians saw 4,200 students at the counseling center. For a student body of USC’s size, this creates a counselor-to-student ratio of about 1 to 1,700. Comparatively, Ivy League schools have an average ratio of 1 to 900.
“I know from my experience and those I talk to on campus there’s been frustration with allocation of resources for mental health,” said Hannah Nguyen, director of the Academic Culture Assembly.
The call for mental health resources rings loud and clear at USC and across the nation due to the sheer number of students affected by mental illness. Since last year, the Engemann counseling center has seen a 25 percent increase in initial assessments and a 20 percent increase in crisis appointments. The National College Health Assessment, which surveys more than 100,000 college students, reported that 25 percent are diagnosed with a mental illness.
“I think it’s taking fire here because people are being able to talk about [mental health] more, and there’s opportunities for people to say, ‘This really does matter, this does affect my day to day,’” said Dr. Ilene Rosenstein, director of the counseling center at the Engemann Center.
Staffing and Space 
A primary concern among students is the wait time necessary to schedule an appointment at the counseling center. Lianne Moreno, a junior majoring in mathematics and economics, waited a month to see a therapist during the Fall 2014 semester when she was experiencing symptoms of depression.
“It obviously didn’t make it any better,” she said.
The University’s most recent plan to hire six new counselors, announced this semester, aims to alleviate wait times. Four of the positions have already been filled, and Rosenstein hopes the remaining two counselors will be hired by Jan. 1. Already, the increase in counselors has allowed the center to reduce wait times for initial assessments from seven business days to 72 hours.
The University also plans to evaluate the appropriate number of counselors annually, said Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry. The ideal number of counselors, however, is something that is difficult to determine.
“That is one of our biggest conversations right now — what is the scope of practice and what is the ideal number of counselors to service our community?” Carry said. “We’re constantly balancing people and resources and space to meet the needs of the community as the number of people in that community continues to expand.”
One way Rosenstein hopes to decrease wait time is to continue Engemann’s preventative strategies, including stress-relief clinics, bystander workshops and group therapy. These programs aim to help students before they need individual therapy.
Additionally, students can take preventative measures to protect their mental health outside the counseling center. Mindful USC, which launched last fall, provides programming to promote stress reduction and workplace happiness. Additionally, the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion offers peer-to-peer counseling.
“We encourage students to really do their research and see what USC has to offer because a lot of resources are underutilized,” said Christine Hasrouni, director of Wellness Affairs for Undergraduate Student Government. “Whenever someone thinks mental health they think of the counseling center, but there are other things available.”
Space available for mental health resources, however, is becoming a concern. The new Engemann Center, which opened in January 2013, devotes an entire floor to counseling services, but the addition of new counselors begs the question of where they will work. Counselors who currently staff the center fill the available space, Carry said.
“Counseling is a very private and confidential relationship so we can’t just pop them anywhere. We can’t just say, ‘let’s build counseling rooms in the Student Union or in the residence halls or classrooms,’” Carry said. “Our hope is to fit them in Engemann Student Health so they’re in the same place where all our counseling services are available.”
Outsourcing: Seeking best care 
To accommodate the number of students in need of counseling services, the Engemann Center, as well other collegiate counseling centers, including the University of California system and New York University, focus on preventive and short-term care.
Following an initial assessment, if it is identified that the student needs more than  short-term therapy (typically 8-12 sessions), the student is often referred to an off-campus clinician. This approach is about finding the best care, including speciality care, Rosenstein said.
“It’s not like you got rejected from counseling service — it’s because this is really good care,” she said. “We’re hoping that students and families will understand that.”
Though outsourcing can be the most efficient way for to students to receive the care they need, for some, being referred off campus can be overwhelming.
Emma Hall, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, had been seeing a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety at home when she visited the counseling center to find an available therapist. After explaining her diagnosis, Hall was referred to a clinician off campus.
Hall said her counselor was helpful in finding a provider who accepted her insurance, but taking public transportation or Uber within the first month of freshman year felt too time consuming and overwhelming, so she stopped seeking treatment. For Hall, who had always dreamed of attending USC, learning that the school could not meet her needs was jarring.
“It was my first realization that this school isn’t perfect,” she said. “Obviously this school can’t be perfect, but I was brand new and this school was my dream, so I was pretty upset.”
While referral locations vary depending on student insurance plans, two practices that the Engemann Center refers students to are within walking distance of campus, and five are Downtown. Yet 13 percent of students referred off campus for counseling stop pursuing services, according to an Engemann Center survey.
“We’re trying to figure out for those who don’t go [and] who stop, what is that about?” Rosenstein said.
The Engemann Center’s student surveys show that the top cause for outsourced students to stop seeking treatment is because they report they are feeling better or are not at a place where they needed services.
Ultimately, students are responsible for their own care, Rosenstein said, and she urges students to follow up with the counseling center if they feel their treatment plan is not working
Going Forward
The sentiments of Hall and others confused about why they cannot be seen on campus, reveal a disconnect between the counseling center and students. Hasrouni called for increased communication between the groups.
“I think one thing they can improve on is making sure that when a student is outsourced, that they are clearly communicating why the student is being outsourced,” Hasrouni said. “I think there should be more hand-holding, so if they’re not seen at the counseling center, at least they know that person is getting in with another clinic.”
To facilitate this process, the counseling center and its student advocacy team will post YouTube videos to their website that explain the process of being referred to an outside clinician. Engemann hopes to launch the updated website in the spring. The site will also feature tools to help students determine whether to seek treatment.
Hasrouni hopes that these services will be clearly outlined in new orientation programming that USG will implement next year. Additionally, Rosenstein said she plans to encourage increased communication with the student body by starting a monthly newsletter to highlight programming, continuing to meet biweekly with the student mental health advocacy group and find new ways to advertise Engemann’s events and resources.
“One of the things that was striking to us is there are all these things that so few students know we’re doing,” Rosenstein said.
As the University strives to promote its available resources, Carry is looking toward the USC Village as an opportunity to further expand mental health resources. When the Village is completed in 2017, the University will add six new residential colleges to its existing seven. This gives Student Affairs the space to explore the possibility of counselor-in-residence programs, which would aim to ease the transition of making an appointment at the counseling center by familiarizing students with counselors in the residence hall.
The University does not have a comprehensive counselor-in-residence plan just yet, Carry said, but administration is working to define what the program would look like, whether it is a counselor who holds office hours, appointments or group therapy sessions in residence halls.
Though the task of satisfying the mental health needs of thousands of students may sound daunting, Rosenstein said she believes a solution is possible once the correct number of counselors and resources is attained.
“We want our students to live up to their potential, and absolutely thrive — not just get by, but thrive,” she said.

For freshman Meghana Srinivasan, greek life played an integral role in her perception of college, long before she moved into the freshman dorms this August.
“I’m from the South so all my friends are in a sorority, and it’s just like kind of ingrained in your mind,” Srinivasan said. “You go to college, you join a sorority and that’s how life is in college. And no one really thinks about like, ‘Is this for them?’ You just kind of go into it.”
But for Srinivasan and many other freshmen who enter the week-long greek recruitment process during the first week of classes, the experience is not what they had envisioned. She said it was overwhelming having to balance the first week of classes, adjusting to a new environment and attending the rigorous week of recruitment parties required of women rushing.
“I totally felt sick because I was just not eating properly,” Srinivasan said. “Everything was just a mess that whole week.”
It is because of experiences like Srinivasan’s that the University administration is speaking with greek leaders about the possibility of deferring recruitment from the fall to the spring semester, citing the mental health of freshmen as a central argument. The Academic Senate recently voted in favor of this deferment. If the deferment is decided upon by the University, it would take effect in the 2016-2017 school year.
“When we think about freshmen, 18 to 19 years old, three months ago they were in high school, and suddenly they’re in this brand new environment where they’re asked to make decisions about which fraternity or sorority they will be committed to for the rest of their lives,” said Ainsley Carry, vice president for Student Affairs.
This level of commitment is something freshman Amelia Montooth struggled with when she went through recruitment this fall.
Montooth, who did not grow up with the idea of greek life, said that she grappled with second thoughts as to whether the process was right for her throughout the entire week-long process.
“You just get to college and then people are worried about what they’re wearing to rush,” Montooth said. “It was really hard balancing it and the first week of classes.”
Montooth received a bid from a house at the end of the week but decided to turn it down due to her uncertainty over whether greek life was for her. After seeing the other girls in her dorm participating in their sororities’ events and vastly expanding their social networks, Montooth began having second thoughts.
She asked the house that had offered her a bid if the offer was still available, accepted the bid they subsequently offered her, but ended up dropping the house again for similar reasons.
“It wasn’t like I thought it would be,” Montooth said. “No one in my family had done greek life, I wasn’t familiar with greek life because the area around where I’m from wasn’t big into it, and it wasn’t what I expected.”
Despite their experiences, both Montooth and Srinivasan, the latter of who also accepted a bid from a house but then dropped because she didn’t feel the house was a good fit for her, said they planned to go through the process again.
They both said they would have preferred if recruitment had been held in the spring semester instead of the fall.
“Having it in the spring would be much nicer. If you know what they’re like more when you rush, you meet people then get super involved in a sorority,” Montooth said.
Opponents of moving the recruitment process to the spring semester say that the difficulties that come up in managing the first week of classes and the demands of recruitment would still exist in the spring semester. They also say that the greek recruitment process in the fall is a valuable way to meet and connect with a variety of other students in the first week.
Landon Fadel, a freshman who rushed and joined a fraternity this fall, said that the recruitment process was a positive way to integrate him into University life and make new friends quickly despite difficulties it may have posed in the first week.
“It definitely made things different that it’s the first thing,” Fadel said of recruitment happening in the first week of class. “I’m definitely glad that I did it. It was a great way to make friends.”
Mallory Gabbard, also a freshman who rushed and joined a sorority in the fall, said she is one of only three students from her Texas high school to go to college out-of-state and cannot imagine having to navigate her first semester of college in a new environment without the immediate immersion into greek life that fall recruitment offers.
“I didn’t have any friends really, I didn’t have any family members out here, I really don’t have anyone [out here] who I’m connected to at all,” Gabbard said. “It’s just been a whole group of girls that … I’m so thankful that I have.”
Gabbard said it is not just the friendship and sense of family that she got from joining a sorority that helped her cope with the stresses of first semester, but also the social and philanthropic elements that got her more involved in campus life and the community. It gave her events to fill the bounds of free time that college affords students, something many freshmen said is a difficult aspect of adjusting to college life.
“The first semester of a student’s college career plays an influential role on the remainder of their college experience,” said Jake Simon, Interfraternity Council president, in an email with the Daily Trojan. “To limit this would be a disappointing change of pace for students who wish to get involved.”
Simon said that deferring greek recruitment to the spring semester would not just deprive freshmen from an entire semester of support, structure and mentorship programs that fraternities offer, but would take a toll on the fraternity houses as well. Some chapters would be unable to accommodate the increased number of men rushing in the spring with the deferment of fall recruitment, and a drop in membership could lead to an inability of chapters to afford housing payments and contractual operational obligations.
Of the 62 schools in the Association of American Universities with greek life, half have spring semester recruitment in place of fall recruitment. More and more universities with comparable academic reputations to USC, such as Northwestern University and University of Virginia, have deferred recruitment.
Carry said that for him, the mental health of students is at the forefront of his agenda for the upcoming years. Already redesigning the orientation experience to focus more on mental health, Carry is looking to make more changes to the freshman experience. One of these considered changes being the deferment of fall greek recruitment and another being implementing a semester-long freshman seminar — in place of the day and a half orientation freshmen currently attend — for freshmen to discuss issues they may be facing with other freshmen and receive information about University life.
“The entire first year is under review for us because right now we have a really stressful beginning of school experience,” Carry said. “So to me this is all part of addressing mental health in the most holistic way possible.”

Mental illness is an epidemic on college campuses across the nation, and USC is no exception. With an understaffed counseling center and rising need for mental health services, the University is facing a growing crisis.
It’s not hard to explain the rise, either. Modern college students’ juggling of classes, jobs, internships and extracurriculars is increasingly weighing down students with additional stressors, exacerbating previous mental health problems and creating new ones. To make matters worse, these issues are still shrouded by a debilitating stigma.
Mental illnesses are rarely treated with the same seriousness as physical diseases. Seldom will someone with the flu be told “it’s all in your head,” and yet, for those with depression, it’s all too common. In an environment that encourages us to “Fight On” and maintain an outward appearance of success, having a mental illness can be falsly interpreted as a sign of weakness.
These misperceptions, however, allow the stigma of mental health to continue poisoning our campus.
In this special issue of the Daily Trojan, we look at fellow Trojans who have struggled with mental illness, from marginalized communities to student-athletes. We examine the progress the University has made toward mental health awareness, as well as spotlight the work that still needs to be done. But most importantly, we hope we can empower the reader to help break down the stigma of mental health at USC, and make sure all of its members are equally cared for in this Trojan Family.

Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was announced as one of 10 semifinalists for the 2015 Biletnikoff Award, which is given annually to the nation’s most outstanding receiver.
He’s hoping to become the first USC player to win the award since Marqise Lee in 2012. Lee is the only USC player who has won the award.
Smith-Schuster is one of two receivers from the Pac-12 Conference to be recognized with this honor, though he is the only one to have already eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark. He currently leads all Pac-12 wideouts with 1,160 receiving yards on 63 receptions, to go along with 10 touchdowns through 10 games this season.
In his freshman season last year, the 6-foot-2, 215 pound wideout caught 54 passes for 724 yards and five touchdowns, which resulted in him being named to the 2014 Pac-12-second team and the Sporting News Freshman All-American team.
Earlier this season, the Long Beach Poly alumnus suffered a broken hand injury against Cal, which forced him to undergo surgery on the Monday before the team’s game against Arizona. Rather than allowing the injury to sideline him, Smith-Schuster not only played, but caught eight passes for 138 yards and a touchdown. It marked the sixth time in which he has eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards this season.
“He is superman,” interim head coach Clay Helton said during that week.
Washington State junior Gabe Marks is the other semifinalist from the Pac-12, and he’s currently second in the conference with 957 receiving yards on the year. Marks, however, leads the Pac-12 with 81 receptions and 13 touchdowns.
Other notable semifinalists include Laquon Treadwell from Ole Miss, TCU’s Josh Doctson and Notre Dame’s Will Fuller.
The three finalists will be announced on Nov. 24, and the winner will be announced on Dec. 10 on ESPN’s The Home Depot College Awards show, which will take place at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta.
Smith-Schuster hopes to improve his case for winning the award when the Trojans head to Eugene, Oregon, to take on the Ducks this Saturday.

Perhaps redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler summed up the feelings around USC’s Tuesday practice best.
“It sucks we had those losses, but we’ve all come out to practice and worked really hard, you know,” Kessler said. “We’re in first place now … We’re all behind coach Helton and ready to keep rolling.”
Kessler had one of his best performances of the season last Friday. Though USC was down at the half, Kessler showed tremendous poise when he rallied his team on a 24-0 run to a comeback victory. USC scored 27 points against Colorado, and Kessler threw three touchdowns in one half, and the offense will again be under incredible pressure this weekend to score and keep scoring if they want a win against notoriously high scoring Oregon, which is playing their best football of the season after having just beaten Stanford on Saturday.
Interim head coach Clay Helton said that scoring touchdowns will be the Men of Troy’s number one priority on Saturday. He echoed Kessler’s sentiment saying that the offense needs to “step up,” if they are forced to have to keep responding to an Oregon score. Helton added that the banged-up USC defense will have to be ready to make stops, create turnovers and do a lot running. With news that Cameron Smith and Lamar Dawson will be out for the remainder of the year, adding to an already long list of injuries, USC coaches experimented rotating Anthony Sarao, Olajuwon Tucker, Uchenna Nwpsu, Osa Masina and Michael Hutchings at the inside linebacker position on Tuesday.
“This is going to be about points,” Helton said. “I think that it always is with Oregon.”
Helton said that the focuses on offense this week are finishing each drive with six points and not three, and teachings the receivers to win their one on one matchups down the field for more explosive players.
“I don’t think you can go in there and have three and outs,” he said. “I don’t think you can get stopped in the red zone, because they are going to put some points on the board. They are leading our conference in scoring.”
Tuesday’s practice was largely focused on the running game on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball. Though Helton acknowledge that quarterback Vernon Adams is Oregon’s greatest threat, he said that his main defensive priority is to stop Royce Freeman and the Oregon running attack. Though it seems paradoxical, Helton said the same thing before USC’s game against Cal and their NFL quarterback, Jared Goff.  His reasoning is this: stop the run, make the team pass a lot and get more sacks on the quarterback — which Helton said worked out for the Trojans, the winners of four straight games.
“I think that we need to shut down the run to put it on the quarterback to win the game by passing. When that happens, just as you see we have done over these past five games, you see 19 sacks,” Helton said. “When you are getting to the quarterback you are getting him off of his spot, you are sacking him. Then he is more worried about the rush than he is about the receiver down the field. That has really been a key for us and it is a huge part of our success.”
Being part of the Pac-12, wide receiver Juju Smith-Schuster says that USC has seemingly faced great opponents every week. In such a talented division, winning often boils down to the team who shows up to play. Smith-Schuster explained that though Stanford might have been expected to beat Oregon on Saturday because they were at home, Oregon won because they were hungrier and better prepared. Schuster confessed that he nearly chose to play college football at Oregon when he was playing safety in high school and that it has always been a dream of his to play in Autzen stadium, except in cardinal and gold.
“It is going to be a lot of fun,” Smith-Schuster said. “I have been wanting to play in this stadium for a while as a Trojan. I took a visit there and, at the time, I was a defensive back, so all of the guys that I saw (and practiced with) up there, I’m going against this Saturday. It will be a lot of fun playing them, but more importantly, we need this win.”
Smith says that USC’s three division losses and tough schedule have a silver lining in that battling against such talented teams every weekend could result in USC being the better prepared team on Saturday. Helton added to this idea — that USC has improved throughout the season as a result of their Pac-12 schedule — when he noted that the Oregon running backs were similar to the Arizona’s backs because they can spread it out and run it just about anywhere.
Helton said that he has told his players in every game since becoming the interim head coach that every game was a playoff game. Though his team has responded with an impressive string of wins that has resulted in their first place title in the South, USC knows that the rest of their games are all still essentially playoff games in that if they lose again, they’ll most likely be disqualified from any chance at the Pac-12 championship.
Because of injuries, USC coaches said that the team will be relying on significant contributions from younger players who have not seen the field much this season.
Outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu changed his position and practiced as an inside linebacker on Tuesday, and freshman Chris Brown will make his first start at USC at offensive guard. Brown said offensive line coach Bob Connelly has rotated him into most of the games this season for 10 to 20 plays. This week, Connelly said that the line will be practicing both silent and loud communication skills in an attempt to combat the crowd noise at Oregon.
“We have been practicing being super clear. Making the calls super loud. Making sure that we are all on the same page,” Brown said. “I don’t think it will be difficult. I feel prepared and confident in the way I am playing now.”
The spotlight will surely be on USC’s offensive line this week, as USC coaches said they want to maintain control of the ball and the time of possession in an attempt to limit Oregon’s scoring opportunities.
Consequently, expect Ronald Jones II and Justin Davis, who combined for 146 yards against Colorado, to have large amounts of carries on Saturday. Injuries to significant starters have caused players like Chris Brown to exemplify the “next-man-up” mentality Helton has unfortunately had to preach all season, which Connelly said leads to a lot of confusion among the line on the field. Though Connelly said that the success of an offensive line is largely defined by the relationship between its players, he admitted he is proud of how young players like Khaliel Rodgers, and Chris Brown, have stepped in and played well in key situations.
Additionally, Kessler said it’s been great to see this young line improve after every game.
“I just have to stay confident in them and really just let them know that I believe in them and I trust them,” Kessler said. “I will get on them a little bit and yell at them sometimes. But they are so young, they are working so hard and I see the effort that they put in.  I never want to get down on them. I love those guys.”
If JuJu would have gone to Oregon, would he have had to return the car he got from his uncle who coaches at USC?

There was no shortage of crazy games this weekend in college football. Of course, that’s to be expected of any weekend in college football.
But this was a particularly packed weekend of important games for USC fans outside of the Trojans’ showdown with the Buffaloes in Colorado. Thankfully, the Trojans’ matchup was on a Friday night, leaving all of Saturday to channel surf, both across and outside of the Pac-12.
For the sake of this season, the most significant game for the Trojans was definitely Utah’s loss to Arizona. The Wildcats came up big for USC, handing the Utes their second loss in conference play this season. The second loss tied the Trojans up with Utah in the conference standings, and with USC’s big win over Utah a couple weeks ago in the Coliseum, USC controls the head-to-head tiebreaker.
But the game I was most interested in outside of USC’s was not a Pac-12 battle, or even a Power Five conference matchup. For me, the most intriguing conference battle was in the American Athletic Conference between Houston and Memphis.
Of course, these aren’t two big-name college football programs — Memphis has had some strong history in basketball, but that hasn’t amounted to much since John Calipari left the program for Kentucky. And the AAC certainly isn’t the premier stop for high-level, super competitive college football featuring future NFL talent.
However, both programs made big splashes this year with very extended undefeated starts. Memphis also had a marquee win with its upset over Ole Miss of the SEC, the only team so far this year that has beaten another powerhouse rendition of Alabama. Both have climbed into the top 25 of the AP poll, so there was a small chance the two could factor into the national championship conversation.
But the real reason why I thought it was interesting was because of the two head coaches at the respective programs. Speculation over who would become the next full-time head coach of the USC football program began once it was announced that former head coach Steve Sarkisian was fired just a day after being placed on administrative leave. Just as the USC program was being swamped in turmoil again, Houston and Memphis were both making their ascents into the national polls.
Both Memphis and Houston were led by young, dynamic, up-and-coming coaches. And sure enough, both of those names frequently popped up on potential candidates to coach the Trojans. Justin Fuente, the head man at Memphis, had just come off a three-year stint as the offensive coordinator at TCU, another mid-major team that emerged as a legitimate national power with the help of some conference realignment. Houston is led by Tom Herman, who was fresh off a national championship at Ohio State as the team’s offensive coordinator before taking over Houston this year. He helped orchestrate the Buckeye’s title run in 2014 despite losing their starting and backup quarterback during the season due to injuries.
So I had circled the matchup between Houston and Memphis on my calendar a while back. The two teams and coaches were certainly worried about more important things for their program, but I viewed it as a potential audition for our head coaching vacancy.
Memphis actually dropped a game before heading into the big conference showdown. The Tigers were shut down by Navy, another very strong mid-major team that’s cracked the top 25 rankings. So the matchup wasn’t quite as exciting as I had originally thought a couple weeks earlier. But I was already leaning toward Herman before Memphis dropped to Navy, and the real test for me was whether or not he should move from the long list of candidates to the short list. And personally, I think the answer is yes.
My initial intrigue into Herman had to do with his prior work at Ohio State. He was an assistant under Urban Meyer, arguably just behind Alabama’s Nick Saban for the biggest name in college football coaching. As a fan coming from the Pete Carroll days, I hope for a return of the USC dynasty, and this next hire will decide whether that happens. Of course, the last two times USC has gone with assistants from the Carroll era, it hasn’t worked out well. But I think a branch off a different coaching family tree could be the key to the next Trojan national championship team.
And Herman’s Cougars impressed against Memphis. Down 20 points just before halftime, and then again just after the start of the fourth quarter, Houston rallied behind a backup quarterback to win 35-34. It wasn’t pretty, but the Cougars got it done. That’s what it takes in college football, and that’s what you want out of a head coach.
Coincidentally, USC’s win over Colorado showed just that of interim coach Clay Helton. There was plenty of criticism for USC letting leads slip last year, but Helton and the Trojans held on to a tight, ugly win against the Buffaloes after going down early, and that’s a great sign for the team going forward this season. Whether this means he’ll be able to hold on to his job title for the long term is still to be seen.
It’s too early to really say what will happen in the head coaching search. All we can say is that USC now has a legitimate shot at the Rose Bowl, and controls its own destiny toward that goal.
Houston, on the other hand, could still win out and probably miss the CFP, much like the three-loss Trojans. I’m rooting for that, too, to give Herman some extra motivation to possibly jump ship if the USC job is open.

The International Student Assembly hosted Shop Around the World: A USC Swap Meet to promote sustainability and international fashion trends on Tuesday. Stationed at McCarthy Quad, this swap meet catered to those revamping their closets. It was also a frugal choice for students who wanted to add new elements to their signature look. In addition to the environmentally friendly qualities of the event, the first 40 participants received a free cup of boba milk tea from Ozero Tea and Desserts in Los Angeles.
An assortment of sweaters, dresses and blouses were hung on lines of rainbow yarn, creating a distinctive aesthetic to showcase all of the items available. The participant could bring in the clothes to the ticketing table and receive tickets for each article of clothing. Each piece was accepted based on quality, brand and international appeal. T-shirts and blouses were worth one ticket, pants and dresses were worth two tickets, and global, high-quality pieces were worth three tickets.
Students could exchange these tickets for items hung on the yarn or displayed on the table. Those who could not find what they were looking for were encouraged to come back later because the event was held from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. This allowed for a constant cycle of clothes to come through.
“We would like to promote awareness for international fashion trends. A lot of clothing styles from Asian countries have a different style than American countries,” said Cherry Tung, ISA vice president of public relations. “[Some have] lace at the end of the shirt that many Asian fashion has that would look really different from an H&M shirt.”
Though some participants enjoyed the variety of clothing, they could not necessarily credit the event as showcasing international styles. Michelle Agcamaran, a junior majoring in computer science, described it as a regular swap meet.
“There are a few brands that I notice, but I can’t really identify which sort of clothing is from which country — they all are the same,” Agcamaran said. “I think it’s because fashion isn’t specific to each country anymore. There are retail stores like H&M and Forever 21 that are opening all around the world with the same trends, and I think it deters from the unique style that each country has. Diversity is something to celebrate. The way people express themselves is something that I like seeing.”
Marvine Soleta, a senior majoring in biology, felt that the swap meet lacked variety for males.
“The clothes here are nice, but the majority of the clothes are for girls and not a lot for guys,” Soleta said. “I would rather trade my tickets for the boba milk tea if we were allowed to do that.”
All in all, ISA encouraged students to be open-minded toward the variety of styles from other countries. Clothes that were not successfully exchanged were donated to Goodwill.
Looking ahead, ISA is planning on holding other swap meets and similar programs to promote multicultural knowledge next semester.

Grand Central Market has always been known for featuring innovative places to eat, but with its new ramen place, Ramen Hood, it puts a cool spin on traditional dishes.
Ramen Hood is a new vegan ramen restaurant created by Ilan Hall, the winner of the second season of Bravo’s Top Chef.  Since winning the show, Hall opened a Spanish inspired restaurant, The Gorbals. Though it was well reviewed, The Gorbals has since closed. According to Eater LA, Hall said he was unhappy with the space and planned to transform the menu, making it almost 80 percent vegan. From this idea, Ramen Hood was established.
Though bar seating is limited, much like its popular neighbor Eggslut, it is interesting to watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen and see the various elements of the ramen come together. Customers who  miss out on the limited bar seating or are in a rush can still take their food in a to-go box rather than enjoying the traditional ramen bowls and spoon.
Unfortunately, though the décor was trendy and the restaurant much anticipated, the standard ramen itself was strangely disappointing. The sunflower seed broth, which was not the typical meat-based broth, lacked flavor. And while the king oyster mushrooms were delicious and hearty enough to almost believe they were meat, there were only two small slices. Perhaps more mushrooms or an addition of tofu could have made the dish feel more substantial. Topped with nori, green onions and bean sprouts, it certainly looked the part, but it missed out on flavor.
The noodles, which are so important to a successful ramen, were considerably thicker than the traditional style and were a little doughy, adding to the blandness of the whole dish. They did not soak up the broth’s flavor as thinner noodles do.
On the other hand, the vegan egg deserves a shout out. The white uses a substitute base and the yolk is a soy base with sulfur added to create an eggy flavor. It was, however, a little off-putting to watch the chef fish the “egg”  whites out of a jar of clear liquid and assemble the egg. That being said, it was interesting to see something so alien looking turn into what looked like a normal egg.
The menu itself is not extensive, with only two options, spicy or regular, and a handful of side dishes. The spicy ramen had a little more flavor than the regular, but not enough to make up for the missing ingredient — meat.
There are a few sides to choose from too. The broccoli with a soy chili glaze was an appealing ensemble, as was the Tofu al Pastor served with onion, radish, cilantro and lime.
Both ramen options are priced at $9 and the addition of vegan egg is $2. This might not seem too pricey, but when considering there were only two slices of meaty mushroom (with an extra two pieces priced at $2), it might not be worth its price tag.
Unless you’re a vegan, stick to the real stuff, such as the traditional, old-school ramen at Daikokuya in Little Tokyo. Those committed to veganism, however, seemed to be pleased with Ramen Hood on Yelp.
Grand Central Market is located at 317 S. Broadway in downtown Los Angeles, about 10 minutes away by car from the USC campus. Otherwise, it’s only a short walking from the Pershing Square metro station.
Ramen Hood is open 11 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., seven days a week.

Few workouts have SoulCycle’s reputation — high intensity, high impact and a legion of followers whose passion for the workout rivals that of a cult.
Walking into my first class, I was intimidated to say the least. The company’s Santa Monica location was absolutely gorgeous. Crisp, clean lines framed the storefront and lobby, which doubled as a retail store selling nothing but SoulCycle-branded clothing and accessories. The back of the studio past the front desk hosted a beautiful locker room as well as changing areas, state-of-the-art restrooms and showers for both women and men, complete with more shower supplies and grooming products than I have at my own house. The message was clear: SoulCycle is a one-stop shop.
As I introduced myself to the staffers at the front desk, I took a peek at the studio layout, spotting my assigned bike, 29, in the second row, smack-dab in front of the instructor. SoulCycle allows its clients to select their bike numbers before each class, so I wasn’t sure if my position would end up helping or hurting me. Though I consider myself to be in relatively good shape, I usually list two weaknesses to my athletic prowess — flexibility and stamina. Most fitness classes I’ve taken seem to challenge the former, but I knew SoulCycle would definitely test the latter. A full-body workout on a bike, SoulCycle boasts of an ability to combine a high-intensity cardio workout with core-engaging choreography.
As I grabbed my biking shoes from the front desk, I was consumed by mixed emotions. I was excited by the fact that the exchange felt like renting bowling shoes, until I turned them over to reveal these shoes were no ordinary shoes — they were clipless cycling shoes, meaning I would be attached to the bike for the duration of the workout. There was no escape. After quickly changing into my biking gear in the locker room, the tap-like clacking of my clipless shoes walking back to the lobby both felt and sounded like walking the plank.
The five minutes waiting for the studio felt like an eternity. One look around the lobby and it was obvious where the SoulCycle cult reputation comes from — in the short amount of time I spent in the locker room, the building had swarmed with clients waiting for the next class, and each of them was dressed in what looked like head to toe SoulCycle apparel. After doing my best to hide both my nerves and my lack of SoulCycle gear, the rest of the class and I finally made our way inside the studio. SoulCycle bikes are nothing like road bikes, and I used to consider myself a casual biker. I use the word “casual” loosely, as I have trouble following my boyfriend up hills. My recreational experience clearly did not translate. The others quickly adjusted their bikes and clipped in while I simply stood there perplexed, not knowing what to adjust or how to go about doing it. Despite my best efforts to hide my inexperience, I stood out like a sore thumb. Luckily, the SoulCycler next to me was kind enough to offer his expertise and assistance. I must admit, however, that one helper was not enough to actually get me on the bike — a staffer from the front desk came over to physically attach me to my bike.
As I moved on from my initial embarrassment and ineptitude, the class’ instructor, Chris, took the stage to introduce himself and start the class. He explained to us newbies the basics of what was about to happen: He would take us through several different speeds, and the key to keeping up was staying with the rhythm and beat of the music. I like to boast about the sense of rhythm I acquired during my two years of drum lessons when I was 14. The truth, however, is that this rhythm comes and goes. If I’m on beat, I’m on beat; if I’m not, I’m just not. As I quickly found out, this class was no different.
SoulCycle instructors are not just spin instructors. They’re also part motivational speaker and part DJ and, as I quickly discovered, Chris has an affinity for EDM music and inspirational quotes that sound like they came from Jaden Smith’s Twitter feed. As perplexing as these phrases were, I found them oddly motivating as I struggled to keep up with the class of SoulCycle regulars. We moved from slow beats to fast ones, and from less resistance to more. Each song brought with it a new beat to adapt to, and just when I got comfortable, Chris would hit the lights and play disk jockey again, disrupting the candle-lit studio and my barely obtained rhythm.
I worked harder in that 45-minute class than I’ve ever worked in my entire life. As Chris preached in the beginning of class, he had one rule — never stop pedaling — and I really did take it to heart. Though there was no way my unconditioned body could make it through the weight section, I pushed and pushed to keep pedaling the whole way through. By the end of class, I was exhausted and completely soaked in sweat; the complimentary towels SoulCycle provided felt like a life saver. The class was anything but easy and definitely pushed my body to its limits, but powering through gave me a sense of accomplishment like no other.
First-time ride classes are $20, and single classes after that are $30. Class packages in five, 10, 20 and 30 are offered and run for $145, $280, $540 and $780, respectively. SoulCycle recommends that clients take classes three to four times per week to maintain progress. The studio has several locations around Los Angeles, including Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Brentwood, Hollywood and Pasadena, with a Culver City location opening January 2016 and a Downtown location opening on 9th and Olive soon after.

Despite going to school in the heart of L.A., it can be difficult to know what to do when you want to explore, and don’t know where to start. Especially for students new to L.A., with literally hundreds of restaurants and attractions, there are an infinite number of ways to go about exploring. To start off though, here is one example of a hypothetical “day in downtown L.A.” that touches on just a few of the simple but well-known attractions in this beautiful city.
9:00 a.m.: Leave USC
Assuming that you are starting from USC, catch the Expo line behind the Galen Center and take it to 7th Street/Metro Center station. From there, transfer onto the red line and take it two stops over to Civic Center/Grand Park station. This brings you within a street or two of the first destination: the Walt Disney Concert Hall, one of DTLA’s most well known buildings.
10:00 a.m.: Chill on top of the Walt Disney Concert Hall
For those who haven’t visited before, one of the best features of the Disney Concert Hall is actually its rooftop garden. What’s great about the rooftop garden is that it lifts you above the bustle of the streets into an environment of peacefulness. The reflective silver of the concert hall itself, juxtaposed with the myriad of trees and shrubs makes you feel like you can forget your problems and exist in the beauty of the present. This is also the perfect place to go and study, or sit with a cup of coffee and read your favorite books.
12:00 p.m.: Lunch at Grand Central Market
No matter what day you go, lunch is always one of the busiest times in the city. What better place to mingle with the residents of L.A. than at Grand Central Market (another one of DTLA’s most visited attractions)? From the Disney Center go back to Civic Center/Grand Park station and take the red line one stop back to Pershing Square station, which drops you off right at the backside of Grand Central Market. Once there, the fun really begins. There’s a wide variety of food, so there’s bound to be something for even the pickiest of eaters. One of the most well-known of these food stands is Eggslut, which, true to its name, specializes in delicious egg sandwiches. There’s also Thai, Mexican, Chinese food and much more, so explore and let your stomach lead you to what sounds best.
2:00 p.m.: Visit the Bradbury building
Built in 1893, the Bradbury building is one of L.A.’s historic buildings, having been featured in countless movies such as “500 Days of Summer” and “Blade Runner.” The building itself is fairly unassuming, but it’s the beautiful, antique interior that gives it its prestige. The moment you step inside, the wrought iron grilling, spiraling up the polished wood railings, and the ethereal glow from the ceiling skylight makes you feel like you’re being transported back to another era. The best part though is that it’s right across the street from Grand Central Market, meaning you can hit both attractions in one go!
3:00 p.m.: Have an afternoon snack at Syrup
By mid-afternoon you may be feeling that post-lunch sweet craving, and one of DTLA’s must-try spots for sweets is Syrup Desserts. To get here from Grand Central, simply walk down Spring Street until you reach the intersection of Spring and West 6th St. As you might guess from its name, Syrup specializes in sweets, particularly waffles, crepes, and ice cream, although they also offer an assortment of sandwiches, coffees, tea, and smoothies as well. Some of their most popular items are the Mixed Berries Liege Waffle and Blackberry-Jasmine ice cream. With such intriguing confections and their relaxed, cafe feel, this is one location definitely worth a try.
4:00 p.m.: Go find Boba 7
So far we’ve explored food and dessert, but what about drinks? One of DTLA’s hidden gems is Boba 7, a boba shop and cafe cleverly hidden in the back of another restaurant, making it a place accessible only for those in the know. And, if you don’t know what boba is, now is the perfect time to find out. To get here from Syrup, go to 7th Street, and walk to the intersection of 7th Street and South Grand Avenue. Look for a restaurant called Soi 7, and go straight through to the back, where you’ll see a small little café — that’s Boba 7. They specialize in unique flavors such as the amaretto milk tea or the horchata boba, and for those over 21, there are several alcoholic boba drinks on offer as well. All in all, the perfect refresher!
5:00 p.m.: Return to USC
After a long day of exploring, returning to USC is pretty simple. From Boba 7, the 7th Street/Metro Center Station is just a few streets away at the intersection of South Flower and 7th Street. Catch the Expo line running to Culver City, and get off again at the USC station by the Galen Center.
This is just one of many, many ways to explore downtown L.A., but hopefully it’s inspired you to take the first step in experiencing a city that has so much to offer.

In response to state-level dysfunction, delays in the reporting of crimes and holes within the criminal justice system, State Sen. Connie M. Levya (D-Chino) will introduce new legislation to eliminate the current statute of limitations on rape and sexual assault crimes, trading in a 10-year period of prescription with a due process sensitive to the needs of sexual assault survivors. Child sexual abuse, oral sex, sexual penetration and other lewd acts will also be included in the proposed bill when the California Senate reconvenes in January 2016.
Whether it be an issue of law enforcement, operational codes within departments, hierarchal structure or a lack of political will, organizational dysfunction at the state level is reason enough to reconsider the statute of limitations on rape as it currently stands. According to Al Jazeera, there are about 12,000 untested rape kits dating back to the 1980s that have been sitting inside police evidence rooms. As of 2014, the Department of Justice estimates that 400,000 rape kits remain untested nationwide. Evidently, institutionalized roadblocks ensure that women and men alike do not receive due process. Eliminating the 10-year time limit would be the first step to counter such obstacles.
From a legal standpoint, the purpose of the statute of limitations is to both encourage people to bring suits promptly and to avoid litigation where witnesses can no longer provide accurate detail. While the intent is mainly to protect the rights of the defendant, the party initiating the suit in court must also be treated with the same level of consideration, a component especially salient with respect to sexual offense felonies. Moreover, the statute of limitations serves as a significant barrier in childhood sexual abuse cases, as by the time a child can both come to terms with what has happened to them and also seek legal reparations, the period of prescription in his or her state will have already reached fruition. Though amendments to the limitations are warranted on a case-by-case basis, there is a potent amount of legal rhetoric employed to deter these types of cases.
The statute of limitations in California on sexual felonies makes the criminal justice system difficult for survivors of sexual assault by not recognizing the side effects of depression and anxiety subsequent to trauma. This has a profound impact on one’s ability not only to file a suit promptly, but to also file a suit at all, as some endure sexual assaults so demoralizing and displacing that revisiting the incident serves more as a detriment than a stepping stone to justice.
In her announcement, Levya cited a study done by the U.S. Department of Justice that discovered only two in 100 rapists will be convicted of a crime. This being said, it is important to note that sexual predators escape legal consequences, emboldened by California’s current statute of limitations. Evidently, an offender should not be able to slide through the justice system because the time limits set by state-level law are narrow. Survivors of sexual assault, including rape, must be assured that the California law not only stands on their side as they seek justice, but also takes a stand to understand the complexities of these types of situations from both internal and external factors.
Official statistics that say only two in 100 “rapists” will see jail time are wholly unreliable because they assume that every report of rape is well-founded, and that “rapists” are evading justice using procedural technicalities–silly things like statutes of limitations. It is an overly simplistic explanation for a complex problem, and it doesn’t hold up in the light of day. Rape often boils down to “he said-she said” disputes for which no one can say what really happened except the parties, but we know that a significant percentage of claims do not warrant the label “rape.” Feminist Brett Sokolow, the leader of the campus sexual grievance industry who has done more to shape colleges’ sexual misconduct policies than anyone in America, last year wrote that he sees “case-after-case” where “sincere victims [sic] . . . believe something has happened to them” even though “overwhelming proof” shows it did not. Mr. Sokolow suggested mental health issues may play an important factor in these false accusations. At Harvard last year, almost 20 percent of rape claims were determined to be false or baseless (the actual number of false or baseless claims might be a lot higher–the vast majority of rape claims can’t be definitively determined one way or the other).
Statutes of limitations in criminal cases are designed to protect the innocent who are accused of crimes, not accusers, and, yes, sometimes they protect the guilty but not because we want them to. The longer an accuser waits to lodge a complaint, the more difficult it is to fairly defend against it. The horror stories of the repressed memories witch hunts are examples of what can occur. In rape cases, there is a national trend to lengthen or eliminate statutes of limitations entirely. This is a concern to the criminal defense bar, the ACLU, and many others. 
The ACLU has explained the necessity for statutes of limitations in sex cases:
“. . . lost in the consideration of these proposals were the compelling reasons to have a statute of limitations, including protecting the falsely accused person who could be charged with one of these crimes.
“The statute of limitations provides important safeguards designed to permit the prosecution and the defense to present a case before the evidence goes stale. Prosecution within a few years of the crime allows a defendant to confront the accuser, and allows the defendant to call witnesses and prepare a defense. As time elapses between the crime and the trial, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for the defendant to prepare a meaningful defense – memories are lost, witnesses have died and exculpatory evidence is no longer available.
“Criminal defendants are presumed innocent, and the prosecution must prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In highly emotional cases, however, juries usually presume that the defendant is guilty, otherwise he or she would not have been charged with a crime. This dynamic makes it exceedingly difficult for an innocent person to mount a defense decades after the crime occurred.”
Every lawyer knows that one’s ability to defend against most claims diminishes with the passage of time. “The statute of limitations is more important in sex cases than really in almost any other,” said defense attorney Gail Meyer, “and the reason is: innocent law abiding citizens engage in sex, all day long … And that’s not so with other crimes. Innocent law-abiding citizens do not engage in burglaries. If you find some one’s fingerprint on the inside of a stranger’s house that’s a pretty good indication they shouldn’t have been there. And if they were to be prosecuted 25 years later, it would be difficult for the defendant to suggest that he had a reason to be in some stranger’s house. …. If you eliminate the limitation period entirely, you are robbing the defendant of the ability to re-create the circumstances of that event.”
Is it fair, or just, to prosecute a man 50 years after an alleged rape? How about 40 years? What are the practical implications if an innocent man is accused of raping an acquaintance ten, or twenty-five, or even fifty years ago? In all likelihood, the man’s accuser would assert that the supposed act occurred on a specific date, at a specific place, and she would paint a vivid picture of the supposed surrounding circumstances of the sexual encounter. She would justify her ability to remember with specificity by the supposed trauma she experienced.
In contrast, the innocent man’s memory will have faded to the point that he likely would have no recollection of even where he was at the time in question; whether he was out of town with the high school basketball team; sick in bed with the flu; away visiting grandma; whether he or she were drinking; what they might have discussed; where they went or with whom they interacted prior to and after the supposed sexual encounter. In fact, the most an innocent man might be able to honestly assert is, “I would never rape a woman and did not do what she alleges, but I have no clear recollection of the night in question.” He almost certainly would have long ago destroyed any evidence proving he was somewhere else at the time of the alleged act (for example, he would have discarded calendars, plane tickets showing he was out of town, credit card invoices showing he ate at some out-of-town restaurant, and any other tangible evidence that would exonerate him). He almost certainly would have destroyed any evidence showing a consensual relationship with his accuser (e.g., love letters or cards, voice mails, emails or text messages). Alibi witnesses likely will have disappeared or even died.
In short, an innocent man hauled into court on rape charges ten, twenty-five, even fifty years after the alleged act would be like the warrior of old entering battle stripped of his shield and sword. His ability to defend the charges would be decimated by the passage of time. 
Unforunately, when it comes to sex cases, mob rule prevails, and state after state after has extended or eliminated statutes of limitations for these crimes. As Prof. Alan Dershowitz says, “Some people regard rape as so heinous an offense that they would not even regard innocence as a defense.”

The University of Missouri and Yale University have garnered widespread attention in the last two weeks, and often in the same breath. But despite what their proximity in headlines may suggest, the events at each university have caught the public eye for different reasons. What they do have in common is that the coverage of and response to images reveal insight about the selective valuation of different voices. Ultimately, they beg the question of whether one can accept freedom of speech as the cornerstone of all other liberties, while also recognizing that not all speech is received similarly or has the same potential to do political work.
University of Missouri graduate student Jonathan Butler began a hunger strike on Nov. 2, demanding the removal of university president Tim Wolfe for his failure to address grievances about race relations on campus. But it wasn’t until the football team got involved five days later that the protests received serious national coverage. On Nov. 8, the coaching staff of the football team released a statement of solidarity with the boycotting players; the following morning, Wolfe offered his resignation.
Rewind to Oct. 28 — the setting is now Yale University. The Intercultural Affairs Committee sent out an email advising students to be wary of the implications of costumes that stereotype a certain race or religion and how that reflects on them as individuals in a larger community. In response, Erika Christakis, who serves as associate master of a Yale residential college, sent out an email to the residents of Silliman residential college questioning, “Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious … a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?” Students expressed their disagreement in a series of protests the following weeks.
Despite their vastly different contexts, “Yale and Mizzou” have been lumped together in headlines for articles regarding freedom of speech. In a piece published by The New Yorker on Nov. 14, protesters at the University of Missouri are cited as violating the First Amendment rights of a student journalist by refusing to let him take pictures. Thus, freedom of the press is wrongly construed as the right of photographers to operate within any space against anyone else’s wishes, rendering legal image release forms obsolete and reading more like a defense of paparazzi photographers.
Similarly, the email sent by the Intercultural Affairs Committee Council at Yale is described as a controlling imposition of censorship. The email, however, threatens exactly zero potential repercussions or consequences for anyone wearing an insensitive costume and is no more controlling than a mother suggesting that her child grab a jacket before going out because it’s cold outside. Using the same logic, Christakis’s email could be said to be equally policing of student behavior. She writes, “Nicholas [her husband and head of Silliman] says, if you don’t like a costume someone is wearing, look away, or tell them you are offended.” This also suggests that students should express themselves without any threat of consequence.
Oddly specific aspects of the situations at Yale and Mizzou are drawn out to paint them as flagrant assaults on freedom of speech. This is an easy trap to fall into when covering such stories, because, first, there already exists a prefabricated paradigm into which the events and names need only to be copied and pasted and, second, concluding by clinging to the absolutism of freedom of speech leaves the writer on a nearly unanimously-accepted moral high ground. This allows journalists, as well as bystanders, to eschew the dirty work of actually delving into the complexity of these issues.
What Yale and Mizzou do share is efficacy for student organizations dedicated to the concerns of students of color. Articles about these events have systematically and ironically invoked the principle of free speech to police student expression. It brings to mind the way peaceful protest was employed during the Baltimore riots in an attempt to police the way people responded to horrifying patterns of injustice and brutality. Requiring people to sound respectful assumes that those who listen will also be respectful, but such an ideology fails to realize that those who are oppressed often meet antagonism.
To invoke free speech when speaking of Yale and Mizzou in order to lump the two together is a statement made on arguably shaky ground to begin with, but because it fits into a ready-made dialogue, it excuses onlookers from the responsibility of contextualization and critical thought. Rather than treating issues of campus debate with an ignorance of respectability politics and institutional power, journalists covering university protests, especially those led by students of color, should be aware of how their own critique plays into this struggle of voices.

Ah, the ankle bootie — a staple in many girls’ fall wardrobe. I don’t know how us Southern California college girls could survive the fall without them. Regular boots can be too hot on our calves when we are only faced with a slight chill in the air, and ankle booties keep our feet warm without the hassle.
It can be difficult to find booties that fit a college budget, which is why we here at the Daily Trojan want to help you ladies out! Whether you’re looking for a cute pair of ankle rain boots (under $50!), or boots like these and these with a bit more heel to help you strut through campus, we’ve got you covered. The gold detail on the heel of this pair will make your outfit feel a little bit more elevated, while the side-zipper on these makes them a bit more on trend. The style of this pair is a little bit closer to that of your traditional riding boot, making it the perfect choice to help tie together a causal fall outfit of jeans and a sweater.
Whatever it is you’re looking for in a bootie, we’ve got you covered with options to satisfy everyone’s needs without breaking the bank!

As part of an ongoing discussion over the deferment of greek recruitment, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry met with the advisers of several greek organizations Monday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
“I don’t want us to have an issue on this campus that we’re afraid to talk about,” Carry said. “This is an issue that we’ve been hesitant to talk about: the quality of student safety, health and well-being if you’re in a greek letter organization.”
On Sept. 30, the Academic Senate unanimously passed a proposal to defer greek recruitment for freshmen to the spring semester and require transfer students to wait until they have obtained a USC GPA before participating in the process. Leaders of both the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council have expressed their disapproval both with the resolution and the lack of student involvement in the process so far.
Carry stressed the fact that the resolution was not a University policy, but rather a question raised by the faculty that needed to be considered. At the end of the meeting, he said that, after consulting with all the relevant stakeholders, he would present an alternative to deferred recruitment to the Academic Senate based on the input he received. Carry said he would meet with advisers, parents and students in the spring to discuss specific improvements for the greek new member experience.
In his opening remarks, Carry said that Student Affairs was concerned with a number of trends among first-year students. He said that issues of mental health, overconsumption of alcohol and sexual assault disproportionately affect first-year students, citing data from Department of Public Safety reports of alcohol-related transports and data from the campus climate survey on sexual assault and misconduct released earlier this semester.
“How do we make the first year experience at USC better?” Carry said. “How do we make it a softer place to land when students arrive here?”
Carry said that the Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees recommended that he look at the first-year experience for greek students as part of his examination of the first-year experience for all students. This was followed by the resolution passed by the Academic Senate.
“That resolution said the University should think about deferring recruitment because of what faculty members see when they look at their students in the classroom and they see the fraternity man in the class who is late, who is exhausted, who is not turning work in on time,” Carry said.
Carry said he had met with representatives from both IFC and PHC who expressed their concern over potential new members interacting with active members, or “dirty rushing,” in the fall semester and explained the protective measures in place for new members. Both councils were also concerned with the financial impact on smaller houses if new members are not brought in during the fall.
Jinny Dalbeck, advisory board chairman for the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, spoke as a representative for sorority advisers. Dalbeck said that all greek organizations were committed to providing the best USC experience.
“We feel strongly that our fraternal organizations do provide, as you mentioned, that support system to these young people that otherwise wouldn’t be available to them for an entire semester,” Dalbeck said.
Dalbeck noted a resolution passed by the Academic Senate in the late 1990s that resulted in greek recruitment being moved from the summer to the first week of classes. Dalbeck said that was the result of close work between the greek community and the administration, which she hoped to see in this process as well.
Dalbeck mentioned the beneficial aspects of sorority involvement including counseling services, GPA requirements for both active members and sorority leaders, mentorship between older members and new members and alcohol safety protocols.
“We provide a lot of support to give them that soft landing,” Dalbeck said.
Russ Chesley, chapter adviser for the Kappa Alpha order, spoke as a representative of the fraternity advisers.
Chesley said that fraternities nationwide have moved to shorter new member recruitment processes and that if a fraternity man’s academic performance was being adversely impacted, there was likely something wrong with that fraternity’s new member education.
Chesley said he would like to see data on the GPA of greek new members compared to new freshmen as a whole and that fraternities were committed to examining and improving the recruitment process.
“We think there is room for improvement certainly, but we also believe that what we provide is really unique and really special for our first year students,” Chesley said.
Chesley said that focusing solely on the deferment of greek recruitment does not address issues of stress and alcohol abuse that would still persist during the fall, and that greek organizations can help students during the transition to college.
“When we have new members, what we have is a great opportunity to monitor those new members and keep them safe, they’re under our wing then,” Chesley said.

Shonda Rhimes, executive producer of acclaimed television series Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy and How to Get Away with Murder, spoke at Bovard Auditorium on Monday to discuss her creative career, inspiration and new self-help book Year of Yes. The Los Angeles Times Ideas Exchange hosted Rhimes, who graduated from the School of Cinematic Arts with a master of fine arts.
Sasha Frere-Jones, staff writer for the L.A. Times, interviewed Rhimes. He began by asking Rhimes to explain the inspiration for her book, which explores overcoming inhibitions. Rhimes said that when her sister told her that she never said yes to anything, she initially felt insulted.
“People think, ‘Oh, you must have this really thrilling life,’ [but] I literally went to work and came back,” Rhimes said. “The bigger my characters had gotten, the smaller I had gotten.”
That moment became the beginning of the novel. Rhimes experienced another breakthrough when she was sent to Washington D.C. to sit with President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama after she was appointed to the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
“Nobody asked me because of course nobody thought I would say no,” Rhimes said. “But when I got home, I realized that if they would have asked me, I absolutely would have … I would have missed what would have been an incredible experience.”
For Rhimes, that moment was a “wake-up call.” For the next year, she pledged to say yes to more new experiences.
Rhimes also spoke about how growing up as a book lover fostered a passion for the arts. In particular, she recalls her parents telling her to get some fresh air.
“Whenever my parents would be like, ‘go outside’ — and, this is my rebellion — I would take a book and tuck it down the back of my pants and go outside and find a tree and read,” Rhimes said. “I was just wild.”
Rhimes also believed her introverted nature influenced her writing. Specifically, she dwelled on her childhood play in a pantry, which she saw as a place of imagination.
“It was like Game of Thrones in that pantry,” Rhimes said. “Part of loving writing is that I get to live in my imagination … Writing, for me, is like living in the pantry.”
In the characters she creates now, Rhimes said she sometimes draws from her personal life. In particular, Rhimes said that she created Sandra Oh’s character in Grey’s Anatomy to “test drive” experiences that she wanted to have.
“What I figured out was that I was allowing a character to say and do all the stuff that I was afraid to say and do,” Rhimes said.
Ultimately, Rhimes concluded that saying yes to more opportunities and experiences began to transform her life.
“You start to feel invincible,” Rhimes said. “You start to feel powerful. You start to feel a lot more in control of your life.”
Frere-Jones also asked Rhimes audience-submitted questions. In response to a question about who inspired her, Rhimes explained that her parents, teachers and strong figures in her early life were all role models.
“Whether or not they were perfect is not the point,” Rhimes said. “You don’t have to know the person. You just have to be inspired by them. You just have to look at them and say, ‘That piece of them is something I want to emulate.’”
Amira Perryman, a senior majoring in international relations, said she found it profound that Rhimes said that it was OK to be unhappy.
“She’s supposed to be having this great Hollywood lifestyle but she’s still unhappy,” Perryman said. “And then just first breaking past that initial barrier she had for herself to then have the year of yes and the life of yes, was the most profound and interesting thing to me.”

Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Quick, sent out a memorandum to the USC community on Monday in response to the various acts of bias and disrespect against minorities at USC.
Titled “Access and Opportunity, Diversity and Inclusion,” the memorandum comes after the Undergraduate Student Government’s resolution on campus climate that was passed Tuesday and recent demonstrations on campus urging for student voices to be heard on campus diversity issues.
The resolution called for action from the University administration following recent incidents related to racial bias. It specifically asked for a $100 million fund to support underrepresented students, additional resources for cultural centers on campus, mandatory diversity training and the hiring of a vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion, among other things.
Quick wrote that he was touched by the student voices, both at USC and at other universities, that have stood up and called for improvement at their institutions. He argued that since its earliest days, USC has shown a commitment to diversity because of its imperative role in learning.
“In the current historical context, that commitment reflects our desire to enrich learning by embracing a broad range of ideas and perspectives, our moral support for the cause of social justice, and our realization, in today’s increasingly global context, that the more diverse the community, the greater its potential for economic and cultural prosperity,” he wrote in the memorandum.
When Quick became provost in April 2015, he outlined his commitment to access and opportunity as one of the four pillars he was going to focus on. He said he’s recently been brainstorming with other members of the Trojan community on ways to increase their commitment to these ideals.
Quick, along with President C. L. Max Nikias and the leadership at USC, have outlined a series of steps that will improve campus climate and enhance access and opportunity.
The first point said the provost is establishing a diversity task force, which will be co-chaired by Varun Soni, the dean of Religious Life, and Ainsley Carry, vice president for Student Affairs.
The force will aim to gather ideas from the campus leaders on how to improve and provide suggestions to various campus units, like the Department of Public Safety and USC Housing, among others.
Second, a series of open forums moderated by Professors Tara McPherson and George Sanchez will, like Quick wrote, “recognize criticism and complaint as a resource rather than as a problem.”
Quick said he will be making a symposium series with community leaders sharing their stance on equity and diversity with students. In the memorandum, Quick invited students to suggest possible speakers and ideas for these panels.
The task force also looks to identify diversity liaisons between the school deans and their faculty that can best address the needs of the community.
“Given the breadth of this University, I believe this broad approach will be the most effective in addressing these issues,” Quick wrote.
The memorandum also said a strategic planning process will chart a course for the USC community over the next several of years.
USC’s Visions and Voices will also direct $100,000 of their budget per year to engage the community in diversity issues, according to Quick.
Quick’s seventh point said there will be a $100,000 fund established that will go to supporting student programs and events that enhance diversity and inclusion. Another $100,000 fund will be administered through the Office of Religious Life to support programming specifically through the University’s cultural centers.
The Office of the Provost will also start soliciting proposals to issue evidence-based approaches toward understanding racial bias and improving relations on campus.
Quick said creating a faculty committee that will work with students and faculty to create residential diversity programs that will impact the residential college experience is another goal.
Improving mechanisms that will record when unfortunate incidents do occur, so that they can be investigated and acted upon as soon as possible. A reporting button has been added to the USC LiveSafe app so that students can immediately report incidents of discrimination.
Finally, Quick wrote that the leadership team at USC understands that though improving diversity is not just about the resources they can implement, taking these steps is helping USC move toward becoming a better, more inclusive school. Quick asked students to understand that the greatest form of diversity is that that comes with opinion.
“We must be prepared not only to support those with whom we agree, but also respect those with whom we disagree,” he wrote. “Only in that way will we live up to the promise reflected in the faces staring out at us from those iconic photographs and create a University of Southern California worthy of them, and us.”
Correction: This article previously stated that the Undergraduate Student Government’s resolution on campus climate was passed on Wednesday. It was passed on Tuesday. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
