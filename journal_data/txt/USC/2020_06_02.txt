Whether it is a national news outlet like CNN, a localized publication like the Los Angeles Times or a college newspaper like the Daily Trojan, one thing is certain: News is the hallmark of an informed society; it educates, uncovers and holds people accountable. 
As people attempt to navigate the flurry of new information and updates, the ever-evolving nature of the coronavirus has led to an increased consumption of local news: The New York Times examined the use and consumption of media and news in light of the coronavirus and found that, in March, local news sites such as The Seattle Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and The Boston Globe showed substantial increases in average monthly traffic, with readership up over 100% from February in some cases. While directly prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, this newfound affinity for local reporting should persist post-pandemic and become a habit of everyday life. 
In a March poll by the Gallup and Knight Foundation, 44% of respondents claimed they were paying significant attention to local news, compared to only 22% of respondents in December. It is no coincidence that as the coronavirus evolved into a real threat in communities, people started brushing up on local news.
At the same time, readership for partisan sites like Breitbart and Fox News on the right and Truthdig on the left stagnated and in some cases dropped.   The concern over the coronavirus — specifically, finding testing centers, tracking the number of confirmed cases and following the newest health recommendations  — translated into people seeking more straightforward, impartial news rather than stories that may be tainted by partisanship. Interest in opinionated takes, which has arguably characterized the media landscape in previous years, has decreased in the face of an existential crisis that lends itself to a desire for hard facts.
Ironically, as the importance of local and objective news becomes increasingly clear, outlets are finding it more difficult to stay afloat.
It has been anything but smooth sailing for newspapers in recent years. According to Forbes, circulation is at its lowest point since 1940, and revenue has decreased by 62% since 2008. While it is obvious that newspapers were already struggling pre-pandemic, the coronavirus certainly exacerbated this downward trend. 
Local newspapers depend on local businesses to buy spots for advertisement. With businesses closing down and facing economic turmoil, newspapers have lost a significant portion of their revenue, leading to major cutbacks and job losses. For instance, the Cleveland Plain Dealer had to fire 22 newsroom workers, an unfortunate but not uncommon occurrence in local newspapers across the nation at the moment. 
According to the Brookings Institute, as of April 6, 57% of counties with at least one reported case of the coronavirus do not have a daily newspaper, and 37% had a local newspaper disappear in the last 15 years. The reality is that the recent trend of increased consumption of local news is contrasted by a more long-standing pattern of its gradual disappearance. 
This moment in history demonstrates the importance of both local and impartial news in times of crisis, when knowing the details and the minutiae may be a matter of life or death. Hopefully, this pandemic will be the launching pad for greater appreciation of and support for both local news and nonpartisan national news. 
Buying subscriptions now is one way to support local news — under the assumption that, when the threat of the coronavirus is not quite as imminent, these subscriptions are maintained and this local news is consistently consumed.
In a wildly chaotic and unprecedented time, news outlets have offered a sense of direction, a way to understand both the world at large and the five-mile radius within a community. It is easy to see why people value objective data, facts and figures during a time of pure uncertainty. 
Post-pandemic, there will no doubt come countless more times when a persisting threat will lead the whole world to furiously check for updates on local and national news. Instead of waiting to be compelled by such an event to check the news, people should continue this behavior regularly.
A public eager to know about what is happening locally and eager to find objective news cultivates an informed society. If we don’t value reporters and news in the little moments, they will cease to exist in the big moments — moments like these, when it seems we need them most.

The coronavirus pandemic has caused irreparable damage, namely the loss of more than 100,000 American lives. That being said, the collateral from the virus has largely manifested as an economic downturn that will take years to recover from: More than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment since the beginning of the crisis, and more than 100,000 small enterprises have gone out of business since March.
The majority of Americans have been negatively affected by the financial fallout from the pandemic. This economic distress has prompted unprecedented monetary and fiscal action from the federal government, especially compared to its response to the financial crisis of 2008.
Congress’ three stimulus packages thus far have consisted of expanded unemployment benefits, direct cash payments to Americans and loan programs for both major industries and small businesses, totaling trillions of dollars.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has bolstered the response by cutting interest rates to zero as well as buying securities to inject money into the economy. The Fed has also ventured into previously uncharted waters by creating loan programs separate from Congress’ to help get money directly to businesses.
The federal government has been doing a lot to help individuals, businesses and entire industries financially survive this crisis, begging the question of where students fit into the landscape of economic relief.  
So far, benefits passed in the relief bills directed toward students have included cash grants given to universities, continuation of federal work-study payments and a short-term suspension of payments on federal student loans.
Although certainly helpful, these provisions are far from adequate. Even in a strong and flourishing economy, many college students enter the workforce in a difficult financial position due to the extreme cost of education and the debt that often comes as a result. The current economic damage will only lower salaries and make it more difficult for new graduates to find a job.
Alumni may enter the workforce with high student debt — which amounts to $32,731 per person, on average — yet still be unable to make payments due to a lack of job opportunities. Outstanding student debt in a harsh economy will not only affect recent graduates, though — Americans already in the labor force who are still holding student debt will be deeply penalized if they are laid off and cannot find a job in due time. Student debt is already a major issue, as it takes over 21 years on average for a graduate to pay off student loans, and that time frame will only get longer if Congress does not take action.
To help ease the burden, Congress should pass provisions in its next stimulus bill to create a program extending student debt forgiveness to borrowers. The amount of forgiveness could be decided based on a number of factors, including financial aid, amount of debt and family income. 
If legislated, the program will be of most help to college-aged Americans, who make up the future of the country’s economy. It will help ensure that the upcoming generation of workers does not get buried under financial pressure before it even gets the chance to find its footing. 
If young Americans are drowning in debt on the backend of this pandemic, they may never be able to reinvest and spend in the economy and will inevitably find themselves stuck trying to catch up their entire lives. Thus, student debt forgiveness will not only act as an investment in individuals but also as an investment in the posterity of America.

USC will resume in-person classes in the fall and pair almost every class with online instruction, President Carol Folt announced in a communitywide email Tuesday. The fall semester will also begin Aug. 17, one week earlier than the original start date, and end with finals before Thanksgiving, the email read.
“I know many of you have been waiting to hear about our plans for the upcoming 2020-2021 academic year,” Folt wrote. “We all are eager to return to campus life this fall and committed to making this decision with a great deal of care and planning.”
The protocols outlined in the announcement align with college reopening guidelines released last month by the American College Health Association and include modifications in residence and dining halls to reduce density and adhere to strict sanitation guidelines. Undergraduate in-person instruction will be supplemented with online classes for students unable to attend in the fall.
With the shift of the semester to an earlier start date, there will be no fall break this semester. The elimination of the recess will also minimize the risks commensurate with the onset of the flu season, the email read. In addition, Welcome Week activities for undergraduates will be held online for all students and begin Aug. 10, while graduate and professional students will receive school-specific notifications.
The University will release more information regarding housing and the move-in process at a later date, Folt wrote. Accommodations will be made for students, faculty and staff at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus, and the University will continue monitoring the pandemic’s effects to gauge the necessity of further changes to the format of fall semester classes. USC is also working with various schools and its Center for Excellence in Teaching to redesign learning, including reconfiguring about 250 classrooms for simultaneous in-person and online instruction and bringing in additional instructional designers.
Classes may utilize seating assignments to enable more effective contact tracing and self-isolation recommendations for students within the immediate area of an infected classmate. To facilitate the resumption of in-person activities, the University will enact a set of requirements, including social distancing, wearing masks, agreeing in writing to comply with health and safety protocols and completing an online training course on public health guidelines, for students, faculty and staff who wish to return to campus. 
Folt’s letter also mentioned building upon measures for practices and competitions that are currently being developed by NCAA and the Pac-12 Conference ahead of the football season. As of now, the NCAA has allowed voluntary in-person workouts for all sports starting June 15 although USC Athletics has not made any decisions yet. The policy for hosting large events, such as concerts and performances, has not been determined, according to the email, but will follow University and public health guidelines.
The letter does not outline specific accommodations or plans regarding international students or University-owned housing. 
Folt wrote that more details on the fall semester will be announced in the near future on an upcoming new website called Trojans Return. Project Restart, an initiative comprising various community members and health officials and spearheaded by Provost Charles Zukoski launched in March to guide the safe return to campus reopening, will continue following its internal Health Policy leadership team’s and the Los Angeles County Department of Health’s safety guidelines when implementing decisions.
In the letter, Folt also acknowledged the malapropos timing regarding the announcement about the status of in-person classes amid national unrest surrounding the police killing of George Floyd but affirmed the importance of communicating the University’s plans to the community.
“I write to you today with the full understanding that we stand astride two of the most challenging situations in the history of our nation: the ongoing tragedies of the COVID-19 pandemic and our recent horror over the senseless killing of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer,” Folt wrote.
Folt concluded the letter by thanking students, staff and faculty for their patience regarding the release of fall semester details.
“Even in this difficult situation, we are committed to building educational experiences that are engaging and of exceptional quality,” Folt wrote. “A successful and safe academic year will only be possible if each of us looks out for the health of our fellow Trojans and community neighbors and partners.”

For rising senior and entertainment beauty YouTuber Amanda Elimian, multidimensional doesn’t just describe her makeup repertoire. When Elimian isn’t creating dramatic navy smoky eyes, bright clearly defined cut creases or even a Harry Styles-inspired pearl bead look, or discussing white beauty influencers’ privilege, the pre-health student is brushing up on the MCAT in hopes of bringing lasting change to a health care system that often fails Black women.
“Makeup right now is just a creative outlet because you need something to make you feel joy when you’re studying for a big exam,” said Elimian, who is majoring in health and human sciences. “Being pre-med is hard. It’s as hard as people think.”
Elimian’s enthusiasm for makeup similarly stemmed from a simple desire for change: After her introduction to the field through the garish looks required by her All Star cheerleading competitions, she decided to pick up a palette and improve. As she perfected her craft, she saw a distinct lack of Black representation in the beauty community, and her camera became her second tool of choice to make a difference.
“A lot of the smaller artists with smaller YouTube channels that did specifically beauty reviews — none of them were Black,” Elimian said. “When I went to go buy a palette and I put it into YouTube, I wouldn’t see any sort of review or swatches or stuff on dark skin.”
Elimian, who has since amassed 132,000 subscribers on YouTube, started her channel in 2018, after her freshman year of college. Following a hiatus during sophomore year due to her busy class schedule, she returned to the video platform last summer.
“I want to stress myself as a regular person who wears makeup,” Elimian said. “Most people who buy makeup are just regular people who wear makeup. So now you can trust, I guess, my opinions and my thoughts on products.”
Keviette Minor, who was Elimian’s roommate freshman year at Fluor Tower’s Somerville Place, a special interest floor for Black students, said she watched Elimian grow as she delved into a wide range of topics, including makeup tutorials, entertainment news and her life as a pre-health student at USC. As her roommate, Minor, a rising senior majoring in design, would at times serve as Elimian’s practice client for makeup looks. 
Sydney Starkes, who also met Elimian while they both lived in Somerville Place, said she grew closer with Elimian because they both enjoyed pop culture. Starkes, who hails from Austin, Texas, said she and Elimian, who is from Westchester County, N.Y., were glad to have lived in Somerville Place having come from predominantly white neighborhoods.
Like Minor and Starkes, Aiyonna White, a rising senior majoring in journalism, found community in Somerville Place and developed a close bond with Elimian. White said she was drawn to Elimian because of their similar introverted personalities, growing closer with shared interests in music.
“I cannot imagine USC without living on Somerville,” White said. “It’s really nice to have a built-in community … With Somerville, we’re called the Somerville family … we were always hanging out with each other.”
While Elimian has always been known for her lively, fun and charismatic personality among friends, White said it has been refreshing seeing her friend come even more out of her shell as a result of her YouTube channel.
“It’s been really exciting watching Amanda grow into herself,” White said. “She talks more, she’s more confident … YouTube has something to do with it, but YouTube didn’t like, give her that confidence. She just matured and was able to fully be herself and project that.”
Starkes, who roomed with Elimian sophomore year, along with Minor and White, attested to Elimian’s work ethic. Elimian adheres to a strict schedule, dedicating the morning to her studies and the evening to her YouTube channel.
“I really don’t know how she does it,” White said. “She wakes up every day at 7 a.m. and studies all day. And then at night, she does her YouTube stuff.”
Although Elimian has had to adapt her workflow due to the pandemic, she often keeps track of both her academic and YouTube responsibilities through compartmentalization, completing her schoolwork at Leavey Library and filming videos at home. 
Her secret for successfully balancing her studies with her makeup career? Elimian’s self-described saving grace is being a morning person.
“I don’t do school work past 9 p.m.,” Elimian said. “Never have, never will. My brain shuts off around 8, so I can’t concentrate on schoolwork past that time.”
While Starkes and Elimian had different schedules sophomore year and Starkes rarely saw her creating content for YouTube, she said Elimian would often reach out to friends for feedback on video ideas. 
“She’s also just a very organized person in general,” said Starkes, a rising senior majoring in cinema and media studies. “She plans out her day completely, and she kind of treats YouTube as she treats her schoolwork because all of her videos, she researches them, she has a little script for them and she puts a lot of effort into it.”
With the coronavirus outbreak, Elimian has become more determined to enter the medical field, as she wants to be on the front lines providing health care services to marginalized groups.
Elimian, who is a first-generation student and whose father is a doctor, said she aims to improve the health care Black women receive in the United States. She recalled an experience while volunteering at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica as an 18-year-old when a Black woman patient asked her to stay in the room, as she felt uncomfortable with the doctor treating her.
“When I talk to other people, especially other Black girls, the relationship with the doctors is not the same,” Elimian said. “And it’s never sat right with me. It’s very worrisome that you can’t go to the doctor without fear of like, they might not want you here.”
Aside from her channel, Elimian is also a member of the Black Student Assembly and its Creative Experience as well as the Pan African Student Association. While she couldn’t attend the former club’s meetings due to a conflict with her MCAT prep class, she helped coordinate makeup for a fashion show in PASA’s Afro Ball hosted in February.
“Most of the eye looks that we did were nontraditional,” Elimian said. “Heavy shine, heavy reflect was the eye look that I did on all my girls. It was stressful. I hadn’t done a big like makeup for a big event with that in a minute since high school … but I think the makeup was incredible.”
Elimian also did the makeup for 2020 graduate and musician Amir Kelly’s music video for his single “Eden.” The makeup artist, who had previously done makeup for photoshoots but not videos, said the experience pushed her out of her comfort zone, allowing her to experiment with more editorial glossy makeup.
The beauty YouTuber also provides makeup services to the USC community with a tiered system that makes it easier for clients to navigate the looks they want. The Headshot, the lowest priced full-face look at $30, includes lightweight foundation, bronzer, cream highlight and contour and powder. The Shoot, the highest tier at more than $55, pulls out all the stops with false lashes and a themed editorial eye look.
“I think my creativity shines more in just focusing on a dramatic eye look … and I like doing that ’cause it really transforms people, and they seem to like the way they look after I do that one,” Elimian said.
Minor said she believes Elimian’s dedication to her craft, regardless of her subscriber count or popularity, secured her success. According to her friends, Elimian was bound to attain recognition, as they said she was constantly innovating her channel and coming up with new ideas. 
Elimian garnered a large increase in following after her video about @EmoBlackThot, a popular Twitter account thought to be run by a Black woman with dark skin but later exposed as a Black man with light skin, released in October. 
“[The video] just happened to break the algorithm. Ever since that time in October, it’s just been kind of exponential growth,” Minor said. “Sydney, she was studying abroad in the fall, she was in London and we were all on the call together … and Sydney was like ‘Oh yeah, like, they know your name out here, and you have fans out here all the way in London.’”
Elimian cited Jackie Aina and Nyma Tang, two Black beauty YouTubers with large followings, as people she looks up to. When Aina, whom she has been watching on YouTube for four years, recently expressed her appreciation for Elimian’s videos, it marked a milestone of how far she had come.
“I’m extremely proud of her,” Starkes said. “At the same time I’m not surprised at her success at all because she’s such a charismatic person and just a nice and caring person … It was only kind of a matter of time before she blew up.” 
Elimian also pointed to fellow makeup artist Vanessa Funes as a content creator she draws inspiration from. Like Elimian, Funes sees makeup as an artform through which she can express herself and improve her mental well-being.
While Funes, who started following Elimian last year when they both got on Anastasia Beverly Hills’ PR list, has not collaborated with Elimian on any videos, she said she would love to work with her on future projects given Elimian’s commitment to speaking out on issues that matter to her, whether that be the lack of diverse shade ranges catering to Black people with darker skin or celebrities’ problematic behavior.
“I feel like her makeup journey has become something much bigger than makeup,” Funes said. “She’s probably … the best YouTuber right now that stands out the most from the beauty community because she doesn’t just touch on the makeup community stuff, she touches on everything in between. Anything that she cares about, she talks about, and I think that’s really important. And she needs to be highlighted as much as she can because she really does deserve it.”
Keviette Minor is an opinion cartoonist for the Daily Trojan.

You never forget your first bad high — ever. By the time you’re in your 20s, you should have God knows what and a truly haunting — though in retrospect hilarious — edible story. 
My edible horror story occurred when I was a senior in high school. What started as a 4/20 celebration and a last hurrah with my friends before we moved on to college ended with a terrifying trip (literally to Ralphs but also figuratively because I did, indeed, think I was dying), vomiting twice and a cannabis-induced coma-like sleep for more than 12 hours. For reference, I took about 33 milligrams of an indiscernible block of jelly. Yeah, I didn’t touch weed for months. 
While I can laugh about it now and it’s a painfully entertaining story to have available at kickbacks, I wish someone at that time had educated me on how to ease myself into cannabis. That’s where microdosing comes in. 
Microdosing is a relatively new method of cannabis consumption where users ingest low amounts of THC to reap its medical benefits without experiencing the psychoactive effects that tend to interfere with daily tasks.
While microdosing has roots in LSD consumption, experts within the cannabis industry are finding that many people have a lower threshold for THC’s medical effects than previously thought. According to Leafly, a cannabis news and culture website, the low threshold is most likely a result of the biphasic nature of THC, whereby excessive consumption can actually produce directly opposing results. For people with anxiety, a group that has been shown to benefit from microdosing, consuming too much THC can actually worsen paranoia. CBD, a nonpsychoactive cannabis compound, can also be microdosed in tandem with THC via a 1:1 ratio to minimize the latter’s side effects, such as increased clumsiness and impaired thinking. 
According to a 2017 study published by the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Chicago, lower doses of THC produce stress-relieving effects similar to the ones cited by cannabis users in empirical research, while higher doses negatively impact stress. The randomized study, which tested 42 healthy volunteers, found that even though THC reduced stress more than a placebo, a mere 5-milligram increase from 7.5 to 12.5 milligrams of THC produced an inverse result.
Aside from anxiety, preliminary studies on microdosing have indicated it can benefit people with depression, insomnia and chronic pain. A 2012 study published in The Journal of Pain concluded that patients with advanced cancer who were unresponsive to traditional painkillers showed the greatest reduction in pain when given the lowest dose of nabiximols, a compound with both THC and CBD, along with other cannabinoids. Patients who received the highest doses exhibited the greatest amount of pain.
For people without diagnosed conditions, microdosing can simply offer an avenue to relieve stress and improve mood. Since its application to weed, microdosing has also been a popular method of cannabis consumption among some clerical workers. Especially amid quarantine measures, some people are turning toward microdosing as a way to destress and take a break from workjob-related tasks.
Microdosing can also offer people a proper introduction to cannabis, helping them build their tolerance to the substance over time. It can also be a new, creative way to return to cannabis after a period of abstinence. 
So how much weed does a person need if a person needs to microdose some weed? 
Given the relatively new and experiential science surrounding microdosing, there’s no one-size-fits-all dosage for everyone. Microdosing is a highly intricate process, requiring specific doses — dependent on one’s metabolism, unique endocannabinoid system, consumption method and previous cannabis use — and consistent monitoring of effects.
Although it takes some experimentation to find the right dosage — and most likely getting too high while trying to do so — typical microdoses range from 2 to 5 milligrams of THC, while some with higher tolerances can go up to 10. 
Researchers recommend taking the same amount for two to three days while self-monitoring. If there are no noticeable effects, you can increase the dosage by 1 milligram, waiting the same time frame to observe any effects. Microdoses can be taken twice a day, once in the morning and evening, but as soon as you begin feeling high (I hate to break it to you) you’ve gone too far. Microdosing should result in a “body” high, producing increased relaxation and, according to some empirical evidence, even an increased focus.
For regular cannabis users who want to hop on the microdosing trend, it is recommended to take a break from consumption for at least 48 hours, the designated time required for cannabinoid receptors in the body to return to baseline levels, thus reaching a tolerance that is receptive to lower doses. 
Now the tricky part: method of consumption. Although microdosing is gaining traction within the cannabis medical field and among users, the industry has lagged behind the trend. Many products do not lend themselves to easy microdosing, with the lowest dose for most edibles being 10 milligrams.
However, some companies are beginning to catch on. KIVA Confections offers chocolate and mint edibles that start at 2.5 milligrams per dose. (I have to be very honest here, though, the one dark chocolate edible I tried from them tastes so bad. Like I-might-as-well-eat-actual-bud bad. And you have to really try to make chocolate edibles taste like weed, given the chemical compatibility of the two, as chocolate is supposed to mask the flavor of cannabis.)
The other trouble with edibles is the wait time. For more immediate relief, you can try tinctures that, when applied under the tongue, can deliver effects within 15 minutes or controlled-dose dab pens, such as those from Dosist. If smoking is more up your alley, you can still use good old- fashioned joints to microdose by waiting five to 10 minutes for the effects after each puff.
While the science behind microdosing is lacking, preliminary patient treatments indicate that continual low doses could potentially build up the endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for responding to illnesses, injury and stress, by increasing cannabis sensitivity in the body over time. Overall, microdosing can be a simple yet effective way to improve physical and mental health.
Oftentimes, conversations around cannabis seem to exist at two diverging poles. At one end, people argue that cannabis is purely recreational, while others believe the substance is explicitly for medical use. 
But cannabis doesn’t have to be strictly defined by one extreme or another. Microdosing — paired with observation, patience and responsible consumption — offers people the chance to benefit from cannabis use on a day-to-day basis without interfering with their personal or professional lives due to intoxication. 
So the next time you try to get high and don’t, maybe it’s for the best.
