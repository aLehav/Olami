As  the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team entered the championship game  of the NCAA tournament on Sunday against No. 2 UCLA, it stepped into  a scenario that featured many familiar storylines: a fifth straight  NCAA final appearance, a chance for back-to-back national championships  for the first time in program history, a fifth match against UCLA this  season, and a head coach with the opportunity to further his record-breaking  success with yet another title.

But  as the final buzzer sounded and the Trojans secured their fifth NCAA  championship since 1998, it was a different storyline that proved to  be most important — the dominance of USC’s senior class.
As  has been the norm for the Trojans this season, the group of 10 seniors — most  of whom had been together since their freshman year — propelled both  the offensive and defensive attack in USC’s 7-6 win over their cross-town  rival, providing the perfect ending to a near-perfect four year stretch  at USC.
“It  was a wonderful ending to the best generation we’ve ever had,” said  USC coach Jovan Vavic, who has been a part of all five Trojan national titles.  “It is really fitting for these boys to end up on top, to win their  last collegiate game, and to beat UCLA. It’s one of those dream-come-true  endings, and I am extremely proud of them and I am really going to miss  them.”
Senior  two-meter Jordan Thompson — who captured the NCAA tournament MVP — and  sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka led the Trojans with two goals apiece;  senior two-meters J.W. Krumpholz and Shea Buckner, and senior driver  Matt Sagehorn each added a score as well. 
The  Trojans were first to get on the board, as Kurzeka was able to find  the net during a counterattack to put USC up in the opening minutes.  A Thompson penalty shot notched the second goal for the Trojans, and  then Krumpholz — who has scored in four straight NCAA tournament final  matches — blasted in a shot from the post to give USC a 3-0 advantage. 
After  UCLA was able to narrow the score to 4-3 in the second, the vaunted  Trojan defense — which has ranked first in the nation the last five  years — came alive, coming up with several key blocks to create counterattacks  for USC. Once again, it was Thompson and Kurzeka driving the Trojans’  scoring, as the senior found pay dirt on a well-contested hook shot  and the sophomore was able to skip in a shot from the left side to put  USC up by three again. 
But  UCLA continued to fight, and goals from juniors Jacob Murphy and Ben  Hohl in the final minutes of the third brought the Bruins to within  one score going into the fourth period.
Like  so many previous games this season, it was USC’s finishing ability  in the fourth period that allowed it to prevail. Sagehorn blasted  in a huge goal to put the Trojans up 7-5 with four minutes left to play,  and despite another Hohl score for the Bruins, the defense was able  to stamp out the UCLA attack in the final two minutes to secure the  title.
“We  were focused on our defense throughout the entire game, and we did a  great job stopping UCLA’s extra man,” Vavic said. “We shut down  their best outside shooter, and everybody contributed.”
Part  of the reason for their success, according to Thompson, can be attributed  to the experience of the team and their familiarity with playing in  the championship round.
“I’ve  never felt that calm before a game, and the guys were saying that they  all felt the same way,” Thompson said. “We knew what we were doing  and we went in being confident, and that really helped us.”
To  get to the championship round, the Trojans first had to face host Princeton,  who entered the tournament ranked No. 13. It was only the second time  in history that the two teams have squared off in the water polo arena,  but the Trojans had little trouble disposing of the Tigers 13-3. Krumpholz  led USC with three goals, and eight different Trojans were able to find  the net. 
The  tournament win marks the first time the Trojans have ever beat an opponent  other than Stanford in the NCAA title game, and it gives USC a 3-2 series  advantage over UCLA for the season. All three wins the Trojans had over  the Bruins were decided by a single goal. 
“It’s  the perfect way to go out,” Thompson said. “We’ve never beat UCLA  in the Championship game before, and to do it as a senior is amazing.”

If  anything can be learned from Assassin’s Creed II, it is that  the Pazzi Conspiracy that unfolded in Renaissance Florence is the stuff  of great cinema. 
Ubisoft’s  blockbuster sequel to its stealth action game from 2007, proves once  again that the French-Canadian development company has a real flair  for the cinematic: despite its almost bloated size, Assassin’s  Creed II features some of the best combinations of set-pieces and  gameplay since the epic action movie in disguise Call of Duty 4.
Assassin’s  Creed II shifts the storyline from the Crusades Era Middle East  to Renaissance Italy. Ezio, a member of a fiction Florentine noble family  finds himself inserted into the historical feud between the Di’ Medici  and Pazzi families — as well as the mythical war between Knights Templar  and Assassins.
As  with its predecessor, Assassin’s Creed II features a number  of historical characters as both targets and allies. Nicolo Machiavelli  shows up at a major plot turn, and a strangely handsome Leonardo Da  Vinci serves as Ezio’s “Q.” One of the game’s best missions  reenacts the Pazzi Conspiracy to kill Lorenzo Di’ Medici on the steps  of the Duomo in Florence, with Ezio stepping in to rewrite history in  his own image. 
As  in its predecessor, this main storyline takes place within the larger  context of a soft science fiction snoozer about a descendant of assassins  forced to play through the memories of his ancestors in order to unlock  vital and vague secrets that will end their ancient war with the Knights  Templar. 
The  framing narrative is an unnecessary distraction from the central storyline.  While the developers are clearly building toward some sort of epic modern  day conclusion, the story ultimately belongs to the hero the player  controls, Ezio, whose descent into an ancient cult would be even more  involving without the knowledge that he was being controlled by some  uninvolving geek in the modern era.
Structurally,  the game eschews the Metroid-style narrative of the first game — let the player have all the weapons and abilities for a few mission  before stripping them away with a dramatic plot twist — and focuses  on the progression of an unassuming and unskilled young protagonist.  Reminiscent of the classic protagonist of Prince of Persia: the Sands  of Time, Ezio is much more identifiable than the solemn Altair of  the original Assassin’s Creed.
In  game design, the developers also opted to streamline and increase rather  than redesign, which the modestly-received original called for. For  all its grand cinematic leanings, Assassin’s Creed II possesses  the same sandbox-style of gameplay that has a tendency to strip such  impact from games such as the Grand Theft Auto series by removing  linearity from the storyline.
In  this sense, the sheer size of Assassin’s Creed II might actually  be its greatest detriment. The story of Ezio’s quest for revenge is  fascinating, but in responding the complaints that the original Assassin’s  Creed was too short and linear, they removed some of the impetus  from the narrative. The sequel features about a hundred side quests,  and more random objects to collect and upgrades to buy than the average  Nintendo 64 Rare game. If the multiple cities Ezio visits weren’t  so varied and beautiful, and his missions so engaging, the game might  very well have fallen into the sandbox trap.
Assassin’s  Creed II belongs to the Dan Brown School of historical fiction,  and the soft science fiction structure lends itself to an obnoxious  self-awareness. Each famous figure is introduced with a wink, as if  saying “why, that’s Leonardo Da Vinci.” Ezio’s Italy is also  practically engorged with secret passageways and codes, each of which  the game endeavors to point out obviously on the map. The game overcompensates  for its size by holding the player’s hand throughout.
While  Assassin’s Creed II features an engaging storyline, the game falls  back on cliché gameplay elements that seem to lack pretext – including  fetch quests, those random collectibles and numerous instances of  Prince of Persia-style platforming. Scaling walls to pick off unsuspecting  guards makes sense within the storyline, but climbing the inside of  the looking for some arbitrary artifact Duomo — though quite fun as  a side-quest — seems somehow out of place within an epic historical  narrative.
As  with the first game, the control structure is not particularly conducive  to platform gaming. The almost revolutionary control structure — each  button controls a different part of the body — makes Ezio a natural  at scaling walls and leaping from rooftop to rooftop, but by the same  token the flow of his motion often has the intrepid assassin leaping  blindly without precision input from the player.
Assassin’s  Creed II is marked improvement in style and scope — and a marginal  improvement in design — over the original Assassin’s Creed.  The game might double cross its cinematic leanings on multiple occasions,  but the simple fun of leaping from rooftop to rooftop, murdering unsuspecting  guards and reenacting some sordid Italian history cannot be denied.  Assassin’s Creed II is clumsy and gorgeous, frustrating and breathtaking — and ultimately a lot of fun.
