The No. 17 USC Trojans suffered yet another upset to an unranked opponent, falling 17-12 to the unranked Washington Huskies at the Coliseum on Thursday night.
After losing to Stanford on Sept. 19, the Trojans have lost consecutive home games in the same season for the first time since 2001.
The Trojans had the ball, down five with under four minutes to play. But a promising drive stalled at the Huskies’ 28-yard line, and Alex Wood’s 46-yard field goal attempt fell short of the upright. The Huskies were able to run out the clock after a couple of first downs and close out the victory.
“At the end of the day, we didn’t coach well enough, and we didn’t play well enough to deserve to win the game,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “That’s the bottom line tonight. A lot of credit to Washington, but this one’s on me. We didn’t manage the game well enough or execute at the critical moments to deserve to win the football game.”
Huskies’ running back Myles Gaskin was the leading rusher with 134 yards on 22 carries. Tre Madden had 120 yards on 17 carries for the Trojans, while quarterback Cody Kessler finished with 156 yards on 16-of-29 passing, two interceptions, and no touchdown passes.
“From the outset tonight, we just seemed a little off, and we started to press,” Sarkisian said. “Guys started to do things a little out of character. Offensively, we had been productive the entire season. Tonight, that didn’t happen.”

The Trojans were coming off a bye week after beating Arizona State on the road on Sept. 26, but the extra rest didn’t seem to prove beneficial.
“It was a different schedule, but that’s never an excuse,” Kessler said. “That’s completely on us. It’s something we’ve got to figure out and fix.”
Washington swung the momentum at the start of the second half. Following a fumble by JuJu Smith-Schuster and a recovery by the Huskies on the Trojans’ opening drive, a little trickery gave the visitors the lead. On the first play, Browning threw a backwards pass to wide receiver Marvin Hall, who found a wide-open Joshua Perkins for the touchdown and a 10-6 lead for the Huskies.
After three consecutive drives ended in punts for USC, the Huskies added on at the end of the third quarter on four straight runs by Gaskin to take a 17-6 lead into the fourth.
The Trojans found some life at the beginning of the fourth on a six-play, 69-yard drive featuring strong runs by Ronald Jones II, and Jones’s one-yard touchdown made it a five-point game. However, the ensuing two-point conversion failed when a wide-open Madden dropped a pass.
“We didn’t play well in all three phases,” Sarkisian said. “We did things uncharacteristic to us. That’s my job as the head coach to get our guys prepared to play. That didn’t happen tonight.”
The Trojans were also whistled for eight penalties, costing them 62 yards.
“We took field goals when we should have scored,” guard Toa Lobendahn said. “There were plenty of times when we shot ourselves in the foot with penalties.”
It was a horrific start to the game for USC offense and Kessler in particular, who was intercepted on two of the Trojans’ first three drives, each time uncharacteristically throwing ill-advised passes.
“They did a good job defending,” Kessler said. “They seemed to be everywhere. They made a lot of great plays.”
“They did a great job of covering, getting pressure on me,” Kessler continued. “It affected us all game. We didn’t execute like we should have. The gameplan didn’t go our way.”
But the Huskies were unable to take advantage of Kessler’s early mistakes, despite taking over deep in USC territory on both turnovers.
Cameron Van Winkle missed a 31-yard field goal and, on the second opportunity, Browning returned the favor as Iman Marshall recorded his first interception of the season at his own 16-yard line.
The Trojans instead went to the run game to find their offensive rhythm.

In their final drive of the first quarter, Justin Davis and Tre Madden navigated the Trojans down the field, and they took a 3-0 lead after the first quarter on a 34-yard field goal by Alex Wood.
Washington responded with a field goal drive of its own that lasted nearly seven minutes to start the second quarter, working its way down to the four-yard line of USC before stalling.
The Trojans finished the half with a long drive of their own, starting at their own 14-yard line and taking it down to the Huskies’ five-yard line as Kessler began to string together some completions for the first time all game. As time expired, Wood’s field goal gave USC a 6-3 lead into halftime.
Sarkisian understands his team is working hard, but the results on the field have been unfulfilling. The Trojans recovered from the Sept. 19 upset by Stanford at home with a rout at Arizona State, but returned to the Coliseum only to suffer another disappointing defeat.
“I’m frustrated because I really believe in this team,” Sarkisian said. “We’re so close, so tight. These guys want to play well. The frustration comes in when we have an opportunity to seize a moment and gain momentum, and we don’t do it. That part’s frustrating to me.”
While the Trojans will likely drop out of the Top 25, Sarkisian, who shot down a question regarding his job security, notes the season is not over.
“Is our season done?” Sarkisian said. “No. We’ll get back on the horse and play good football. There’s a lot of football left to be played, but we have to hang together and stay together and learn together. There’s no magical potion to sprinkle. It’s going to take hard work, and I don’t doubt that our staff and players are going to do that.”
The Trojans will look to recover next week on the road at No. 15 Notre Dame.
Let’s hope Pat Haden meets the plane returning from South Bend next week with a Pink Slip for Sark.
Then let’s hope Pres. Max Nikias is next in line with a Pink Slip for Haden. Twice now we’ve proven that a good football player doesn’t  translate to a good A.D. (Mike Garrett and Pat Haden, both our home-grown failures.)
The only intelligent thing Haden has done so far was to fire Lane Kiffen. (But he hired Kiffen too, didn’t he?)
Pat could have handled the Reggie Bush affair with the NCAA much better, but he simply didn’t have the balls to do it. So Pat, Goodbye, enjoy your retirement on my alumni dollar.
Shades of the Paul Hacket era…admits there are problems on the team but not able to fix it. I personally have no confidence that Sarkesian led team can consistently win. What now?

It’s only fitting for this year’s Trojan team to have heard boos rain down from the Coliseum in what was once predicted to be a cakewalk. Instead, the most unpredictable squad in recent memory turned in a dismal performance, as they got outplayed in all three phases of the game.
USC’s loss to Washington was nothing but disappointing. Coming off a bye week with over 10 days since their blowout win over Arizona State, the well-rested Trojans should have come out sharp and fresh and dominated Steve Sarkisian’s former Huskies team.
Contradicting the famous words of former Arizona Cardinals head coach Dennis Green, the Trojans aren’t the team I thought they were. Quite frankly, they’re the most inconsistent team I’ve had the misfortune of covering.
Sarkisian’s team came out slow, rusty and undisciplined — absolutely unacceptable after so much time off to fine tune areas that needed improvement and to get players healthy.
It’s a shame that the Trojans can never just make it easy on themselves. Staring down a few ranked opponents in the coming weeks, USC had the opportunity to pick up where they left off against the Sun Devils. The team could have come out, strung together a few scoring drives, forced a few turnovers and taken Washington and their freshman quarterback, playing in his Pac-12 road opener, out of the game.
That’s in a perfect world, though — one that USC doesn’t live in.
Their redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler set a dim tone early when he threw an uncharacteristic pick on USC’s opening drive of the game. He would go on to throw another one two drives later.
It doesn’t help Kessler’s cause, though, that he was sacked on the first play of the game and was later forced to extend one play with his feet by evading pass rushers in the back of his own end zone.
Protection and penalties had been two of USC’s greatest issues going into the game and neither of them got any better against the Huskies.
Eight penalties for a total of 62 yards allowed sacks that resulted in poor field position for the Trojans throughout the game. A pathetic one-for-13 on third down isn’t going to get it done. To add insult to injury, stalwart center Max Tuerk went down with a knee sprain, leaving a massive void in the heart of the Trojans line.
All night, offensive coordinator Clay Helton appeared to be trying to force the issue to Adoree’ Jackson. Normally this wouldn’t be problematic, but the plays were exclusively focused toward the sideline, giving Jackson little room to operate. Where were the drag routes and middle screens that were so effective against Arizona State?
The Washington defense had clearly scouted the Trojans, as they were prepared for the bubble screens to the edges of the field and snuffed them out on a regular basis. It’s mystifying why the team was unable to make any adjustments at halftime when this fact was readily apparent to all of the fans in the Coliseum.
Not all of the blame can be placed at the feet of the coaching staff. Right from the start, Kessler appeared afraid. His penchant for perfectionism is admirable when things are going well, but the game against Washington was another example of Kessler’s mind getting in the way of his considerable talents. Though he threw downfield infrequently, when he did it looked as if he was forcing throws, aiming the ball instead of letting it flow.
The loss couldn’t come at a worse time for the Trojans as they now enter the toughest three-week stretch of the season. This type of effort won’t hold up against the likes of Notre Dame, California or Utah.
Maybe the loss will ignite something in this year’s Trojans squad and compel them to play with a passion that was noticeably absent for most of the Washington game.
It’s five games into the season and there are more questions than answers in the second year of Sarkisian’s tenure.
The next few weeks will demonstrate if Sarkisian can truly coach and lead a team that is once again facing a mountain of adversity going forward. Will he be able to rally his team to live up to preseason expectations or will this be another year in which the Trojans squander their immense potential? Only time will tell.

Men’s water polo will head to the coast this weekend as they compete in the SoCal tournament in Malibu, an annual tournament in which the Trojans have been wildly successful in the past.
The team is looking to capture their fourth straight title, as well as their 12th championship in the past 13 years. The annual Kap7 SoCal Invitational is the counterpart to the NorCal tournament the Trojans played in earlier this  season.
“It’s a little bit different because the NorCal tournament is the first big tournament we’re in,” sophomore driver Grant Stein said. “Now that we’ve played a couple of those top teams, we know what to expect coming into SoCal this weekend.”
The Trojans have already had plenty of competition to get their season heated up, both in the NorCal tournament and at home this past weekend.
USC avenged a NorCal loss to Stanford in a high-stakes overtime 12-8 victory over the visiting Cardinal. The Trojans have had to keep their focus this week to avoid getting caught up in what was the win of the season for the team so far.
“There’s no relaxation after that win,” Stein said. “It was a good win, but there’s no relaxation going into SoCal.”
The 16-team field of the SoCal tournament includes all 10 MPSF teams. The teams will be battling not only for their chance at a title, but also for their national rankings. Thirteen of the 16 teams are ranked in the top 20 in the country.
USC will open their tournament bid against San Jose State on Saturday morning before playing either No. 6 UC Santa Barbara or No. 15 UC San Diego in their final matchup of pool play. The rest of the tournament will be bracketed based on Saturday’s results. The Trojans will need to pull out two wins on Saturday to land in a Sunday semifinal.
USC started the season ranked No. 2 in the country and dropped a single spot after their NorCal tournament loss to Stanford.  Following their big weekend however, the Trojans have regained the second spot in the country behind crosstown rival UCLA.  The Bruins took home the NorCal championship, beating Stanford 8-7 in the title game.
The Trojans aren’t worried about who they will be playing, though. The team acknowledges the fact that even though they will be up against top competition in the country, they are focused on avenging their loss to UCLA in the NCAA championship game last season.
“We keep focusing on the main goal: winning a national championship. As long as we can keep that thought in our heads we’ll be able to focus and win more games,” Stein said.
The Trojans are resting comfortably on the shoulders of very equal scoring. The team has the top offense in the MPSF with just over 19 goals per game. Junior Blake Edwards leads the team in goals with 35 just 13 games into the season. Sophomore Matteo Morelli is second in scoring with 22 goals, and just behind him are sophomores Lachlan Edwards and Grant Stein with 20 goals apiece.
To complement their high scoring offense, the Trojans are also boasting the second best defense in the MPSF, allowing just over five goals per game.
Well written article!  Keep up the good work!

Co-ed co-op · Mona Xia, a junior majoring in critical studies, and Tylre Roberson, a junior majoring in English, are working to launch a web series, Co-ed. – Photo courtesy of Erin Ramirez
It’s junior year of college, and two USC students have made it their mission to create a web series about their experiences growing up in college for the entertainment of the rest of the USC community. This is the story behind Co-Ed, a new web series that the creators are hoping college students across the country will identify with.
Co-Ed is the brainchild of Mona Xia, a junior majoring in critical studies, and Tylre Roberson, a junior majoring in English with a concentration in creative writing. Xia was initially inspired to create a show after seeing the success of her fellow classmates creating shows.
“I was producing at Trojan Vision for CU@USC, and one day I ran into a friend from a screenwriting class I had taken the semester before,“ Xia said in an email. “She told me that she started her own show on Trojan Vision, and I thought that sounded really great, so I asked her for advice and she told me who to contact.”
As soon as she thought of the idea of the show, Roberson was one of the first people Xia reached out to, and their creative chemistry was evident from the get-go.
“I knew I didn’t want to do this on my own so I reached out to Tylre because I had worked with her on campus and I knew she was interested in writing,” Xia said. “Before we knew it, we were meeting at Panda Express, pitching our ideas for a mini-series.”
Co-Ed is a dramedy focusing on the Three’s Company-esque idea of a freshman boy living in a suite with two girls. According to Roberson, deciding to make the show a web series instead of putting it on Trojan Vision forced the duo to focus in and really decide on what they wanted their show to be.
“We actually looked into Trojan Vision and decided to make it a web series instead,” Roberson said. “That took a lot of cutting down and finally solidifying the idea of a comedy about what it means to start college and be a college student and how to grow up really fast.”
But going the independent route has its challenges as well, and after many hectic days of writing, producing and managing money, actors and equipment, Xia and Roberson have already learned a great deal about how the business side of the entertainment industry can sometimes undermine the creative side.
“I think the director of our pilot put it really well — it’s a constant tug-of-war between money, time and quality,” Xia said. “If you don’t have money, then you’re gonna need a lot of time to make a quality show. If you don’t have time, then you’re gonna need a lot of money.”
But at the same time, these are two college students, which is why they turned to the crowdfunding site Kickstarter to make their dreams a reality.
“The Kickstarter is mainly a way for us to raise money and raise awareness about the project because, I mean, we’re college students,” Roberson said. ”Most of it’s been coming out of pocket right now, but we’re hoping to raise $3,000 dollars in the next 10 to 15 days to fund the project and basically fund our dream.”
But Mona isn’t worried about making sure that dream is perfected because, at the end of the day, she knows that the best idea in the world is pointless if nobody else sees it.
“I know that artists all aim for perfection, as you should, but if you had to choose between completing a somewhat flawed project and giving up on an unfinished masterpiece-to-be, definitely go with the first option,” she said. “No one will ever see this ‘masterpiece’ if you don’t finish it.”

When I was asked to be the news assignments editor for the Daily Trojan this semester, I admittedly did not know what to expect. When I had been a news writer, my main responsibility was to go an event once a week, and write about it. I just had to make sure I was at whatever event I was assigned to and that I turned my story in on time ­­— things that are, in retrospect, easier said then done. So when I accepted the chance to become an editor, I figured my job was going to be as simple as finding out what events are happening on campus, putting them into a calendar and then forgetting about them once writers took them off my hands.
I couldn’t have been more wrong. At this point in semester, what I’ve learned more than anything is that news doesn’t have a calendar. Just as breaking news can disrupt the most relaxing day, even the most solid stories can hit snags. Though we strive to figure out what stories we’re covering weeks — sometimes months — in advance, news isn’t always something that can be predicted. As a section, that is something we always have to keep in mind. Though it’s easier to simply assign writers to cover events (and much less maddening, if we’re being honest), as the news section in a newspaper we have a responsibility to the readers to do more than just that.
My mentality from the beginning of this semester has changed. I’ve learned a lot of lessons (usually the hard way), and at this point, I like to think I have a much better idea of what people want to read about than I did before.
What we as a section strive to do every day is to keep the student body and wider USC community informed. We know that it’s important that you know about what the administration is doing to make the university a better place. We know that you care about what other students are doing as well to make a difference on campus, whether that’s through philanthropy, their own start-ups or calling for the university to take action. We know that you care about what’s going on in USG, about the Greek system, about whether or not crime is happening around campus, and we want that to be reflected in our section.
I can honestly say that trying to get all of these things to fit on anywhere from two to four pages each weekday has made me a more conscious member of the campus community, so I hope that reading the news section of the Daily Trojan has that same effect on my fellow Trojans. As members of this community, we should strive to become not only news-conscious students, but also active partakers in conversation on our campus, be it about combatting racism or increasing wages for workers.

Futurama · The USC Hyperloop team is working together to create a 28-passenger pod that will travel through a tube at high speeds to transport passengers from Los Angeles to San Fransisco in only 35 minutes. The team is preparing to present their project to SpaceX in the Summer of 2016. – Photo courtesy of SpaceX
Alexander Declue, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering, has formed a team aimed at making traveling from Los Angeles to San Francisco a 35-minute trip.
Forty engineers have already joined Declue’s group, following SpaceX’s announcement of the Hyperloop Project, which will create a viable, downscaled pod to help expedite the development of this fast, inexpensive mode of transportation.
Teams are basing their vehicles off of a 58-page design that was created in 2013 by SpaceX Founder Elon Musk.  It lays out a mode of transportation, similar to a train, in which people and materials can travel to San Francisco in 35 minutes.
“A new mode of transport is needed that has benefits of the current modes [of transportation] without the negative aspects of each,” Musk said in the design.
The “pod,” set to carry 28 passengers, will travel through a low-pressure, steel tube, elevated off of the ground by concrete pylons while undergoing acceleration by linear induction motors that generate electromagnetic force.
The competition will take place in June 2016, but Declue’s group is already hard at work to achieve a pod that will operate by then.
“Once the competition was announced in June, I immediately began to reach out and start a team,” Declue said. “Throughout the summer, we began preliminary research to approach problems with Musk’s original design.”
Hyperloop is estimated to be less than one-tenth of the cost of the proposed “California High Speed Rail.”
But with this evacuated cylinder design, the USC team needs to overcome many problems in the scaled down version.
“The biggest challenge is [the cylinder] is at 1/1000 of an atmosphere,” Declue said. “There isn’t any kind of machinery to suck in enough air to levitate the craft. We’ll need off-the-shelf equipment.”
Declue also recognizes that they will have to change Musk’s original Hyperloop Alpha plan to account for problems he did not accurately address. They have already changed their own design multiple times as more information and guidelines have come out.
“The design may change substantially,” Declue said. “But the concept remains entirely similar in the spirit of Hyperloop Alpha.”
USC’s Hyperloop team recently received more details from SpaceX regarding their pusher vehicle, basically a Tesla motor and steel tube, which will be filled with concrete and covered with two aluminum sheets to create a level surface for the pod to travel on.
“We just received the information that we needed on Tuesday,” Declue said. “Now our design approach has changed.”
But the team cannot base their pod solely off of Musk’s technical paper, which has been found to have multiple errors.
“It wasn’t a very big technical paper and many things have been found wrong,” Declue said. “So we had to work full time during the summer to get to the point where we are at today.”
Now the team is focusing their efforts on researching different systems for their subgroups.
“We are designing individual subsystems that are necessary for the pod and doing trade studies on different variations,” Declue said. “The main question is how the critical components will function.”
Each Hyperloop group is integral to any success that USC will have in the competition. Time is of the essence because by Jan. 13, groups will have to submit their final design package.
“We have people working on energy storage, power electronics and conversions [and] finalizing the outer mold, pressurized air distribution, the physics of air bearings and flight software,” Declue said. “We need to exercise redundancy without taking two years to develop because the goal of the competition is to make these pods easily scaled upward for humans.”
At this point, funding has been secured through Viterbi’s Competition and Design Team Program.
“We submitted a proposal to receive funding only for the build of the vehicle — only toward parts and materials,” Declue said. “But it only covers a fraction of what we need.”
Declue and the rest of the team are looking for more students to help with the rider experience, software and structure groups.
“It’s important for USC and is the best project that has been presented so far because it is so interdisciplinary,” Declue said. “There is room for everyone to do something. We even have a whole group dedicated to the rider experience.”
The team is aiming high, but knows it is possible that its design will not succeed.
“The most likely scenario is to have a vehicle that works a little bit or crashes,” Declue said.
Their faculty advisor, professor Geoffrey Spedding, still has high hopes for his team.
“My role is to primarily represent [the team] at the Viterbi school level,” Spedding said. “But I’m also a cheerleader.”
Spedding has been astonished by these students’ organization, commitment and intelligence.
“I’m confident that they will represent themselves and us as well as can be expected. I am very impressed by people and degree of organization on this team,” Spedding said. “If we could put the right resources behind them we will get a testable design.”
Other companies independent of SpaceX and the competition are working on this project — including Hyperloop Technologies and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies. USC is competing against teams that have more manpower, resources and technology.
“There are [a] number of teams with varying degrees of resources and materials,” Spedding said. “But they’ve done as well as anyone could have hoped for.”

In January 2015, two USC computer science majors, Liam Duffy and Bernard Xie, wanted to utilize their digital skills for good. After putting together a team, they’ve been able to impact the community, and nonprofits, around them and are continuing their efforts with two new projects.
Duffy and Bernard are the founders of Code the Change, a USC student organization dedicated to providing free software development to nonprofits in the Los Angeles area.
CTC’s first upcoming project is in partnership with Good Shepherd, an organization of shelters for domestic violence victims in L.A. CTC is working on a digital platform that would expedite the process of placing victims of domestic violence in shelters that fit their needs.
“Let’s say someone gets attacked by their significant other and calls 911. The police would come, pick them up, take them to the police station, and from the station they would call each shelter and check things like availability and credentials,”  CTC project manager Kevin Kim said. “What our app is going to do [is] allow the police officer to automatically find a shelter that fits the victim’s criteria and get directions immediately. It takes the victimization out of the process.”
The second project focuses on creating a digital communication platform for the Neighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance.
“We’re empowering the neighborhood councils to have an online community where they can communicate better with each other,” tech lead Brian Kim said. “They will also be able to reach out to the public with environmental and drought-related initiatives.”
The team plans on completing, or at least testing, these two projects by the end of the semester. They work on two week planning and goal-based shifts, with project managers to steer the process along.
These are not CTC’s first projects. Last semester they worked with an organization called College Knowledge, which was started by USC graduate students, to develop a web application which would allow for low-income high school students in the area to easily access free college resources.
“The idea behind this is hacking for good or hacking for impact,” Xie said. “We are an interdisciplinary student org that consists of programmers, designers, project managers, engineering majors and business majors who develop technical projects with nonprofits who would not have the means to do it otherwise.”
Kim said he joined CTC as a project manager to supplement a passion for volunteerism he could not satisfy in the corporate world.
“I have a good amount of experience with project management stuff from internships,” Kim said. “I had a lot of fun, and I learned a lot in the corporate environment. But one thing I really wanted to do during my time as a Trojan is to give back.”
Cofounder Duffy stumbled upon the Stanford CTC chapter and its founder Sam King last fall.
Duffy talked with King on Skype, and King encouraged him to reach out to the best people to create a team and start canvassing nonprofits in the area about their digital needs.  The result was an original team of about seven or eight, and at least 10 to 15 applications from nonprofits.
According to Duffy, however, nonprofits are not the only ones who have benefitted from CTC’s work.
“We are hoping to provide a space where, as a community, we can all learn the most prevalent technologies, and build skills for the real world on our own,” Duffy said. “The culture and community of our organization is unique. These are really good people and really smart people.”
The work is challenging and rewarding. To most in the group, the results are tangible.
“Pretty much all these projects we pick up or think about picking up have no shot of coming to fruition without somebody trying,” CTC tech lead David Bell said. “To be able to be that person or that group that contributes the time that really makes the difference is the best part.”

In the wake of the shooting at Umpqua Community College, media coverage has sensationalized the deaths of nine students and a professor into a defamation of the mentally ill, unfairly portraying an entire group of people to avoid the intersecting issues of gun control, political dysfunction and racism. It is time for policymakers, health professionals and university administrators alike to work toward increasing emergency preparedness.
Since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, there have been 142 school shootings. In 2015 alone, there have been 17 shootings on college campuses. It has proven to be a common issue, and yet, the fact remains that the campus shooting protocol is something that still needs to be taught and practiced in the form of mandatory courses and drills.
Campus shootings have not received the recognition necessary from the administration to demand action in the form of a mandatory emergency preparedness course or lockdown drills. Though there are mass shooting preparedness plans in place through the Department of Public Safety, in the event of a mass shooting, these plans are not widely publicized to the student body. Preemptive education has the potential to improve more than physical safety, but mental and emotional safety as well.
In high school and elementary school, students are prepared for campus shootings through lockdown drills, but in college, this mentality of preparedness disappears. This should not be the case. Shootings happen too often in elementary schools, high schools and colleges. It’s time we started treating it as such at this University.
An emergency preparedness drill for school shootings would provide an appropriate opportunity to address this issue as well as work toward  prevention. By implementing such a measure, the University could help prepare students for a potentially life-threatening scenario while simultaneously spreading awareness about the real causes of gun violence.
But even if this exercise were to be implemented, emergency preparedness is still a student responsibility. Both the USC and DPS websites have information regarding campus safety and emergency preparedness, and there are several measures in place — Trojan Alerts, blue light phones, campus security and the USC Trojan Mobile Safety app, to name a few — to minimize the impact of a campus emergency. Students, however, are often unaware of these resources or don’t utilize them effectively. Only 30 percent of students are signed up for Trojan Alerts, and many have not looked into other services provided by the administration. Though implementing such a drill would be in everybody’s best interest, it can only be effective if students take it seriously.
In preparing for a potential campus shooting, both the University administration and students must be careful not to wrongfully blame mental health issues and instead focus on practical measures. The goal of USC at this time is to destigmatize mental health issues, but it also needs to responsibly deconstruct the myths that relegate the individuals actually dealing with these issues every day. Oftentimes, shootings are minimized and used as a tool to demonize mental illness. These disaster preparedness programs need to actively work against this stereotype while also preparing students for the event of a shooting. It is important to open up a dialogue and teach students to think critically about shootings. It is important to not just teach emergency procedure, but also open up critical dialogue about what leads to these incidents. Students need to be wary of pulling the mental health card when it comes to gun violence on college campuses as it has triggering implications in and of itself — considering that those with mental illness are far more likely to be the victims of violence rather than the perpetrators.
It’s time the University takes the burden of learning safety protocol for campus shootings off of the students and takes responsibility for educating its students. Opening up a dialogue around an issue as common as campus shootings is the best way to impact positive change. Campus shootings don’t have to be the norm, and it is the University’s responsibility to create a new normal.

The Los Angeles Police Department receives 48,088 calls each year in response to domestic violence. Yet, initiatives and funding for this issue have not been effectively prioritized. LAPD must be trained to relocate victims to safe houses and funding must be used to create adequate shelters. Domestic violence is preventable, and our local city officials must do everything in their power to allocate and augment existing resources to bring case rates down.
In the past year, cases of domestic violence in the city of Los Angeles have been strikingly misclassified and underfunded, according to an audit report released late last month by L.A. City Controller Ron Galperin. Despite a $3.2 million increase in funding for domestic violence cases in 2013-14, cases have risen 5 percent this year alone, according to the LAPD, and shelter-based agencies are still lacking. Bold initiatives to combat domestic violence must be implemented in Los Angeles.
The report proves that Los Angeles — in comparison to other major cities — is behind in monetary allocations for initiatives against domestic violence. In the 2013-14 year, Los Angeles spent $3.2 million, whereas San Francisco allocated $4 million towards prevention and intervention programs. In stark contrast, New York spent $107.2 million.
One of the greater issues at hand is the mislabeling of specific cases of domestic violence as “generic assault.” This mischaracterization has led to several cases of prolonged abusive relationships in which it is more difficult for affected individuals to take action. For example, in 2013, auditors found that though the LAPD reported 10,184 cases, there were actually 14,112.
Currently, LAPD tackles cases of domestic violence through Domestic Abuse Response Teams. Though seemingly effective, the model does not adequately respond to callers, as only one out of every 30 callers receives a response, according to the audit. Additionally, the report stated that in the Central, Devonshire, Foothill, Hollywood, Mission, Olympic, Pacific, Topanga, West L.A., West Valley and Wilshire divisions, there were no DART teams available. In 2015, DART teams were reported to work in only 10 of the 21 LAPD stations — showing inconsistency among preventionist efforts. This, too, must be changed.
Recently, Mayor Eric Garcetti has allocated roughly more than $1 million to efforts combatting domestic abuse. Though Garcetti is receptive to these changes by pledging to create a domestic violence working group with city employees to create family justice centers, he fails to take into account what exactly occurs at the time of incidents. Strong backlash for his new pledge lies in the fact that victims require immediate help upon undergoing the stress of domestic violence. Though family justice centers are important, there must be a focus on shelters that provide safe spaces for instantaneous aid.
The audit report clearly defines the major concerns of the inadequate domestic violence preventionist efforts. First, the city lacks a well-equipped governance model that works in accordance with various agencies who offer domestic violence services.
According to the report, “During the 2013-14 fiscal year, San Francisco spent $4.84 per capita in responses to domestic violence with shelters, interventions and education and prevention programs.” New York spent $12.75 per capita in the fiscal year. Los Angeles, on the other hand, is spending $1.04 per capita. If this doesn’t spark some sort of reaction, I don’t know what will.
Galperin provides several adequate recommendations for preventionist and interventionist efforts, highlighting the need to focus on halting domestic abuse, rather than simply working on plans to punish perpetrators. According to Galperin, it is prevention, not reaction, that will spark change. In response to the increase of domestic violence cases — correlated with the spike in arrests by violent action in L.A. this year — it is imperative that the LAPD, city attorney’s office, mayor’s office of public safety, housing and community investment department and the domestic violence task force are reevaluated for the services they offer and receive additional funding for those services.
Making feasible change begins internally. Since the DART force’s creation in 1994, it was intended to allocate $5 million to domestic violence shelters. But as stated in the audit, over the last six years, the city has allocated only $2.5 million on average. This information further highlights the necessity for Galperin’s “comprehensive service delivery system,” which will allow a system that focuses on prioritizing initiatives that will place prevention first and reaction later, without diminishing the importance of either.

Search is on · Rosamund Pike plays Amy Dunne, a housewife who feels trapped in a manipulative marriage and suburban life. When Amy goes missing, her journal paints Nick in an incriminating light. – Photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox
A new genre of books has emerged in the last couple of years. The incredible and exponential success of Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl and, more recently, Paula Hawkins’s The Girl on the Train has spawned a new category of thriller novels. These novels are all alike in one way: They feature leading female characters who are manipulative, underhanded and often murderous.
There is no doubt that these types of novels are thrilling, with Gone Girl selling more than 7 million copies in 28 countries and The Girl on the Train breaking the all-time sales record in England by holding onto its No. 1 bestseller spot for more than 20 weeks. Gone Girl spawned a blockbuster movie starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, earning multiple award nominations. Now, The Girl on the Train looks to be going in the same direction, with the film adaption, starring Emily Blunt, set to be released in 2016. But the root of these books’ success is that they’ve become prime fodder for book clubs for women around the world. In fact, my own mother has read both books in her various book clubs. I asked her what she thought of them, and she told me, “They are very compelling reads, and you get carried away by the storyline.”
There’s no doubt that this new style of thriller, centered on the vengeful wife who will stop at nothing to punish her husband for his wrongdoings, is all the rage. However, beneath the fast-paced plotlines and the excitement of a good mystery, something much more sinister seems to be going on. The fact is, all these novels are portraying their female characters as evil and vindictive. This upsets me — not only because these characters end up supporting wildly inaccurate stereotypes, but also because both novels are written by female authors. As an English major, I have taken several creative writing classes during my time at USC and have frequently written on my own time. One thing I’ve learned as a writer — and I’m not claiming to be a professional — is that every character you create needs to be believable as a real person. No one is purely good or evil, as good people do bad things and bad people do good things. This complexity, and, more importantly, humanity, is something that seems to be missing from the women in these novels.
I don’t mean to say that the female protagonists in these books are completely two-dimensional. The Girl on the Train’s Rachel is a deeply troubled woman battling addiction and trying to make sense of a failed marriage after her husband cheats on her. Similarly, Gone Girl’s Amy, who feels used and forgotten, is a woman trapped in an unhealthy marriage. Both of these women are desperate, but, especially in the case of Amy, their cruelty seems unwarranted. The extent to which the women go in these sort of novels to get revenge on their husbands indicates that their whole lives revolve around their marriages or romantic relationships. Moreover, it signals that they have no sources of happiness outside their romantic partner and that they are willing to sacrifice everything simply to “get even.” The modern day woman has so much more going on in her life outside romantic attachments that this “forgotten housewife” angle seems outdated at best.
But these books aren’t the only ones to fall into this pattern.
A. S. A. Harrison’s acclaimed novel The Silent Wife also revolves around a woman who feels that, after her husband betrays her, her only option is to murder him. Even the cover art for this novel features a woman’s ominous shadow and the title is dripping with blood — hardly a symbol of female empowerment. In Unravel by Calia Read, a young woman named Naomi finds herself in a psychiatric ward, trying to decide whom to trust between her two suitors. I understand that there are themes here of women being trapped, but the fact that so much of their lives revolve around hysterical behavior and calculated torture paints a very negative portrait.
When I first read Gone Girl, I remember finding Amy’s intelligence striking. Her plan was so perfectly coordinated and so immaculately thought-out that I felt it changed the classic murder mystery and, to an extent, portrayed these women in a positive way. If they were cruel and vindictive, at least they were smart and impressive. It wasn’t until later that I realized what a terrible image of women this created. Yes, Amy’s husband was selfish and obtuse, but his faults paled in comparison to Amy’s seemingly unstoppable bloodlust.
In the end, I find these books as entertaining as the next person. During college, when it seems like I’m trying to juggle a million different things, all I want is a fast-paced book that will keep me interested and doesn’t feel like a chore to read. These books are just that. Still, I think it’s important to acknowledge the message that these female characters are sending is not a very inspiring one. In all areas of life, women are leading the way and empowering one another, and it’s time our literary females started to do the same.

Michael Almereyda’s docudrama, Experimenter, does what all Psychology 101 textbooks aim to do: teach psychologist Stanley Milgram’s famous obedience experiment in a way people will never forget. The fast-paced, 90-minute film takes the audience through certain points of Milgram’s controversial professional and personal life.
The film opens with the Milgram’s study, which he conducted while he taught at Yale. In the experiment, a subject is designated the role of the teacher while another person, one of the researchers, acts as the learner. Separated from the learner by a wall, the teacher is then tasked with reading off pairs of words before quizzing the learner. An incorrect answer from the learner results in a shock delivered by the teacher. The teachers were goaded by Milgram to deliver deadly, 450-volt shocks to the learner. In Milgram’s pool of subjects, 65 percent of the teachers delivered a shock of the highest capacity despite begging to stop the experiment. Only after the experiment did Milgram reveal that the learner’s anguished begging was just a recording, calling experimental ethics into question.
This film obviously aims to get the audience to sympathize with Milgram and his findings, as he asked if all people under obedience could be capable of comitting heinous crimes that occurred during the Nazi regime with people brainwashed by obedience. Experimenter made no effort to explore the other side of the story, leaving the film at a great disadvantage. Depicting historical and controversial figures as saints without addressing the concerns of the doubters weakens their argument.
Luckily, the film is carried by the the enormously talented Peter Sarsgaard. Sarsgaard is the standout performance — he engages the audience. Experimenter showcased Sarsgaard addressing the audience directly and showing moments from Milgram’s life. This film’s approach was not effective, but it was bearable because of Sarsgaard’s natural charisma in front of the camera. In particular, Sarsgaard’s diction was addictive. His voice is very smooth, deep and enticing, which made it easy to listen to him talk for most of the movie. However, Sarsgaard is more than just a suave voice. He is famous for transforming himself for each of his roles such as in An Education and Jarhead, and Experimenter is no exception. Sarsgaard not only adopts Milgram’s signature retro beard, ill-fitted suit and subtle hunch, but he also dives into the character’s idiosyncrasies. Every twitch of the eye and look that Sarsgaard gives helps make Milgram more than a name in a textbook. Almereyda, in that sense, succeeds in creating a multi-dimensional persona for Stanley Milgram.
There were also some moments of tenderness between Milgram and his children that, though they do not serve any purpose plot-wise, give a gilmpse into his personal life. The movie certainly allowed the audience to separate Milgram from his work.
Though Almereyda’s script should be acknowledged for its boldness in the docudrama genre, it is made weaker through poor editing that cuts between different periods in Milgram’s life in a way that was uncorrelated and too quick to appreciate. It feels like more of a mistake than a stylistic decision. The quick editing method also did not allow for the audience to follow the story coherently as it switched between a chronological and achronological structure.
However, at the end, there was an extremely powerful scene, between Milgram and his wife, Sasha (Winona Ryder). Sarsgaard delivers his lines with extraordinary ability reminiscent of Colin Firth in The King’s Speech: powerful and piercing to the heart. This scene left an impression on all audience members. And though one scene of excellent writing cannot excuse the poor script, it leaves the the audience thinking about their own free will and humanity, which is, at the end of the day, what Milgram wanted.

USC students fight on at a Garba event, even at a UCLA. Palak Patel | Daily Trojan
Walking on to UCLA’s campus felt beyond strange. I felt like someone should be yelling “Trojans aren’t invited!” at me or jeering at my obvious lack of UCLA gear. Instead, I just strolled down Bruin Walk, a place I never expected to find myself, and into the UCLA Garba. Garba is a festival celebrated in various parts of India to celebrate the death of Ravana, a terrible demon. The festival traditionally involves nine days of endless dancing, socializing and staying up into the wee hours of the morning. When my friends told me that UCLA was hosting a night of Garba and invited me to attend, I almost laughed out loud. Yet, after hours of my friends convincing me that students from other schools were welcome, some of my floormates and I decided to take our chances and attend the event. Quite honestly, it was the best decision I could have made.
The Garba was both breathtaking and incredibly well-organized. There were dozens of students helping to check in the hundreds of attendees quickly and efficiently. Inside the auditorium, students dressed in gauzy Indian saris flitted around the space like a crowd of colorful butterflies.There was a sort of electric energy in the air. In addition, an amazing live band was playing traditional Indian folk music, and a number of students were performing basic dance steps to help teach those unfamiliar with the traditional dances. But perhaps the best (and most shocking) part of all was the sheer number of USC students in attendance. There were Trojans everywhere, spinning in out of the intricate dance circles, crowding eagerly around the water fountain and getting a breath of fresh air out on Bruin Walk. 
As a USC freshman, the very idea of even mentioning going to UCLA seemed taboo. However, attending Garba showed me how wrong I was. Despite being their biggest rival, UCLA was more than accommodating toward us, and seemed genuinely happy to have us join in their event. In fact, prior to the Garba the UCLA Bollywood dance team hosted a workshop in conjunction with USC Zeher, a Bollywood dance group on our campus. 
Perhaps one of the biggest misconceptions that USC freshmen have is the idea that we are limited to our own campus. Although USC has an incredible array of cultural offerings, it’s also important to take advantage of the fact that Los Angeles is home to many other schools besides our own. 
Attending events held at other campuses can give you the chance to do something that might not be offered at USC, as well as aid you in widening your social horizons and meeting other students that now call this vibrant city home. With services such as the ever-expanding metro system and Uber, getting to other campuses is surprisingly cheaper and more convenient than most would expect. So next time you hear of an event being held at a nearbycampus, don’t shun the thought of attending. Instead, check to make sure outside guests are welcome and then round up a few friends and head on over together. While you’re there, don’t forget to show a little Trojan spirit!

Almost halfway into the college football season, some things are starting to become quite clear — namely that every single team is vulnerable in some way, shape or form. Last weekend was a case study of this as previously unbeaten teams Ole Miss, Georgia, Notre Dame, and UCLA all lost.
Cal is undefeated, Florida is on top in the SEC-East and Sark is a coach at USC. What year is it again —2003? With a show of hands, how many of you thought Cal and Utah would be playing in one of the top matchups of this weekend? Anyone besides the Cal fans? Yeah, that’s what we thought too. 
For those of us accustomed to the traditional power programs of college football leading the pack at this point in the season, fear not — this week’s unusual matchups are still likely to give us exciting, down-to-the-wire games. That’s certainly been the theme of this season thus far. And there will no doubt be even more upsets and craziness this weekend as every conference, save the Big Ten, looks up for grabs.
You may be wondering —  why I’m not talking about the results of the model last week? Well, in case you were too busy studying for midterms last weekend and didn’t watch any football, there were quite a few upsets and our model took quite a hit. Hearts were broken, tears were shed, but USC is off its bye week so we’ve still got something to cheer about. Alright, let’s get to the games!
No. 23 California at No. 5 Utah (Spread: )
One of the biggest questions going into this game is how Jared Goff will fare versus Utah’s front seven. Goff has thrown for 1630 yards and 15 touchdowns on the season, but hasn’t yet faced a defense of the same caliber as Utah. Cal’s undefeated record and Goff’s four interceptions on the season mask the fact that he has struggled making throws under pressure, so it’ll be interesting to see how he performs against Utah’s tough defensive line. 
In a rout of Oregon last weekend, running back Devontae Booker had a quiet night compared to past weeks. Expect things to be quite different as Booker and the rest of Utah’s offense go up against a Cal defense which gave up 44 points to Texas (the same Texas team that really struggles with all things special teams).
Our model favors California in this matchup, but Cal is going to have to bring their A game in order to beat a tough Utah team.
No. 19 Georgia at Tennessee (Spread: )
While it always seems as if every college football coach is in the hot seat, Tennessee’s coach is truly in a must-win scenario to keep his job. Tennessee has lost three of its last four games and has blown a two-touchdown lead in each of those losses. The Vols have also allowed 172 rushing yards per game, so don’t expect them to stop Georgia’s running back, Nick Chubb, who has rushed for 745 yards on the season and racked up seven touchdowns or quarterback Greyson Lambert who’s also managed to throw for seven touchdowns. To stay in this one, Tennessee is going to need to keep up offensively, as their defense hasn’t been particularly strong and Georgia will be out for blood after their win-streak was snapped at home by Alabama.
Tennessee is in for a tough matchup this week and our model has Georgia slightly favored, but this game could easily be a blowout.
No. 13 Northwestern at No. 18 Michigan
Oh boy, a tale of two defenses. Both teams shut out their opponents last week. Funnily enough, one of the biggest obstacles in the way of Michigan and their continued shutout streak is their quarterback. Michigan’s quarterback, Jake Rudock has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns this season and he’ll need to make smart decisions this weekend because every offensive possession is going to count against Northwestern. Despite Michigan’s quarterback issues, Michigan does have its home field advantage going for it at “The Big House” this Saturday.
Washington at No. 17 USC
Well, hopefully the Trojans are well-rested after their bye week and ready to take on a familiar opponent here at home. With UCLA and Arizona both going through losses last week, our Trojans are still in the hunt for the Pac-12 South race and should be looking to use this game as another tuneup before our series of tough matchups to close out the season. 
The Huskies are also coming off a bye and their last game was a loss to Cal. Washington has a very young offense and true freshman quarterback Jake Browning hasn’t thrown a touchdown against a Power Five conference team. This young offense is going up against a USC secondary that’s only allowed three passing touchdowns all season. Despite their offensive struggles, Washington has lost by a less than a touchdown in both of its losses, despite being outgained offensively 818 yards to 438 yards. This shows that Washington’s defense should not be taken lightly. Furthermore running backs Myles Gaskin and Dwyane Washington lead the Huskies’ running attack with 347 yards and six touchdowns, combined. With Washington’s quarterback struggles, expect coach Chris Petersen to try to get their running game started early in the game.
Questions raised about Justin Wilcox’s defense were quieted after the game against the Sun Devils where the Trojan defense came up with four key turnovers. Regardless, USC’s run defense will have to step up against the Huskies. Our rushing defense has allowed 164 yards per game and they’re going up against a team that’s going to be relying primarily on their rush offense for most, if not all of their offensive production. If the Trojans can limit the run and put pressure on Jake Browning, the Trojans should be in the clear.
But USC’s defense isn’t the only group that needs to make some adjustments for this Thursday’s game. USC’s offensive tempo is significantly lower this year at 66 plays per game. Look for Sark to up the tempo and focus on improving third down conversions to keep our offense on the field for as long as possible.
Our model has USC as the favorite for this game but when it comes to USC football the adage “one step (game) at a time” is key.

“First and foremost that the participants in college athletics have to be full-time students at their universities participating in sport, and second that they be amateurs, that they not be professionals,” Mark Emmert, president of the NCAA, declared last year as he testified in the Ed O’Bannon trial. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal he further argued, “Increasing the academic preparation of freshmen and transfers, holding teams and coaches responsible for academic success, and requiring academic eligibility standards for post-season competition will promote real academic success.”
In order to underscore and support that belief, the NCAA went ahead and scheduled Thursday night games in college football. On Thursday, USC will take on the University of Washington Huskies at the Coliseum at 6 p.m. That’s 6 p.m. on a Thursday night in the middle of the fall semester when students have midterm exams, homework and a plethora of other activities that fill up a typical week. I personally do not even get out of class until 6 p.m. on Thursday. 
The first obvious question is why would the NCAA and the Pac-12 schedule on a weekday a football game that is typically played on a Saturday? For that answer, look no further than the $3 billion deal the Pac-12 signed with the ESPN and Fox to broadcast games. A clause in the deal gives full autonomy to providers to choose programming. Sports networks are trying to piggy-back off the success of Thursday night football in the NFL with the inclusion of some Thursday night college football games. 
While that means big bucks and opportunities for cable, advertisers and television, it hurts the one party that perhaps matters the most — the student-athletes themselves. For them, it is already difficult to balance academics and athletics. Add on a game — not a practice, but a game during the week — and the concept of student-athletes being “students first,” goes out the door. 
I have a French quiz in class from 4 to 6 p.m. Thursday. Say there was a football player in my class or there was a player who had class during that time. It is troubling to think the team, university and conference would ask them to play in a prime-time football game rather than attend class — and then not receive any compensation from the millions of dollars of profit from the whole spectacle. 
At least USC student-athletes will be playing at home. Washington players have to travel and potentially miss more class time. And our rivals across town arguably have it worse. UCLA has this week off, but then undergoes two consecutive weeks with a Thursday game, first taking on the Cardinal at Stanford and then hosting Cal in Pasadena the following week. That entails earlier practices in the week, more travel and added stress to student-athletes as they juggle grueling Pac-12 matchups and classes that are starting to gain steam. 
Furthermore, the NCAA and college football hold dear the process of honoring and maintaining tradition. Schools like USC, Notre Dame and Ohio State play more on national TV and recruit the best players partially because of the storied history of their programs and the traditions passed on from generation to generation. Typically, fans of all ages gather together and tailgate to support their team before games. On Thursdays, there are no tailgates, at least on campus, in order to respect the academic setting and environment. In today’s world of college football, Thursday games have become somewhat common, but it is relatively new to the pantheon of college football history. In truth, it’s a budding practice that has no real place.  
If Emmert, the Pac-12 and the rest of the NCAA were truly concerned for the academic success of their beloved student-athletes, then any talk of Thursday games would be out of the question. There is no redeeming academic quality to a weekday game, and when the game is televised on ESPN on prime-time that it becomes clear financial incentives take precedent over player welfare and academic concerns. 
We’re playing against the University of Washington on the field, not George Washington on the dollar bill. For the sake of putting students first and not the dollar, let’s stop Thursday games.

Persona non grata · David Huebner, the first openly LGBT ambassador confirmed by the U.S. Senate, spoke to students on campus Wednesday about the difficulties he faced as a gay diplomat in New Zealand. – Anastasia Velicescu | Daily Trojan
To begin his presentation to the International Relations Undergraduate Association and Residential Student Government on Wednesday, former United States Ambassador David Huebner gave a traditional speech in Maori, honoring the spirits who came before him and the land on which he stood.
“We are nothing without those who came before us,” Huebner said. “And in that way, I am nothing without those who came before me, and those who will come after me.”
Huebner has worked in a variety of roles, from practicing law at Arnold & Porter LLP in Los Angeles to opening his own law firm in China, along with founding the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. His greatest accolade came in 2009, when Huebner became the first openly LGBT person to be sworn in as an ambassador by the U.S. Senate.
This was the focus of the first half of Huebner’s talk — how social justice and public policy intersect for an openly gay U.S. diplomat. Throughout his career as an ambassador, Huebner encountered incidents of discrimination. When he was first appointed as the U.S. ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa, same-sex marriage was illegal in both countries. He was on the hit list of multiple militias. Huebner’s husband was barred from benefits typically given to spouses of U.S. diplomats and, therefore, couldn’t work as a physician when the couple lived in New Zealand. Several of the senior officers in the embassy held meetings without him, discussing their concerns that Huebner would “turn the embassy too gay.”
Huebner was not discouraged by this discrimination. Instead, he took it as a challenge and watched as the attitudes in those countries adapted through the years he worked with them.
“Being out is the single most powerful statement an LGBT person can make,” Huebner said. “If you are out and visible, social justice occurs.”
After presenting briefly for 20 minutes, Huebner opened the floor to questions from the  approximately 40 students in attendance. The questions ranged from how Huebner, a leader in political social media usage, used Twitter as a diplomatic tool to how ambassadors can affect policy in the countries they work in. He spoke in depth about the impact he had in New Zealand as a communicator and an advisor.
“It’s not a diplomat’s role to make policy, but if you’re good enough at communicating, you can certainly influence policy,” Huebner said. “We don’t all think the same way. But if you listen and are willing to truly hear the needs of those who you’re working with, you will be able to find common ground.”
The event was organized by sophomore RSG Social Justice and Inclusion Coordinator Jackie Kim, who met Huebner last spring at a Pacific Council luncheon covering international policy and invited him to campus last spring. Kim felt that Huebner’s unique approach to diplomacy and his passion for reaching out to future leaders would be a perfect fit for USC students. Huebner’s talk was part of IRUA’s career month and echoed RSG’s focus on sponsoring events that support diversity and inclusivity while developing social justice across campus.
“He has experience and insight from his ‘nontraditional’ experience in the foreign service to offer to USC students,” Kim said. “Getting more exposure to USC students is something he really enjoys. He was impressed with the attentiveness and engagement of the students at the event.”
As a final question, Kim asked Huebner to share what he saw as his legacy — both as a diplomat and as an LGBT leader. But Huebner told students that their legacies should be at the back of their minds as they approach a future in diplomacy.
“Don’t go into a job worried about your legacy,” Huebner said. “I like to think about my career as being shot out of a cannon. My main fear was just don’t screw it up. Whenever you’re the first, you can’t make mistakes. But I think the thing I had was being unabashedly who I am. That, if anything, was my legacy.”
Correction: This article previously stated that Huebner began the event by speaking Samoan. He spoke Maori. The article also stated that sodomy was illegal in New Zealand and Samoa when Huebner took office. Same-sex marriage was illegal. The article has also been updated to reflect that Huebner faced incidents of discrimination, not discrimination “at every turn.” The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

On Thursday, some students face the unusual dilemma of having to choose whether to attend their classes or the football game against Washington, causing concern for both students and faculty.
In anticipation of this, and to accommodate the Thursday night game, the administration asked professors to consider rescheduling classes.
In an email to USC faculty and staff on Oct. 6, Provost Michael Quick made a series of suggestions to faculty, including rescheduling class for another time in the semester, holding class at another location or scheduling off-campus activities and work for Thursday.
“The University of Southern California is committed to minimizing the disruptions caused by weekday games,” Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry wrote in an email to students on Sept. 15. “We are taking steps to ensure students have access to academic facilities such as the libraries, parking, dining and tailgating alternatives off campus.”
Smrity Randhawa, professor of clinical accounting in the Marshall School of Business, said she was made aware of the potential conflict from the outset.
“Right when I was assigned the classes I was told, ‘This is going to be an issue. Yes, you can have the class, but attendance might be an issue in the class.’ So at that level, you try to address it proactively,” she said.
Randhawa rescheduled her Thursday class for an earlier date because of the game. She saw the Thursday football game as an opportunity to learn how to be more flexible as a professor.
“We work in a changing environment,” Randhawa said. “As faculty, we should have the foresight or the ability to be able to teach students using different mediums.”
However, Terek Rutherford, a freshman majoring in business administration, said having a Thursday evening class can sometimes create difficulties for students.
“It’s really unfortunate that the school puts students in a no-win situation, where they either go to class and are one of the few students there, so they get personal attention, which makes class more valuable — but if they do that, then they miss out on the game,” Rutherford said. “If they go to the game, obviously they have fun at the game, but then they miss out on the instruction they might have with their professor.”
Jessica Dillon, a senior majoring in public relations, said she wasn’t sure if rescheduling Thursday classes was the best course of action either, though.
“My professor seemed a little ambivalent about it but understanding that that’s our culture, and that we would just be sitting there hating life,” said Dillon, who had one of her classes cancelled. “It’s kind of weird to me, especially with those classes where I only meet with them twice a week. I really value the time I have with my professors, so it’s kind of a tossup.”
Rutherford said the situation was a catch-22.
“No matter which way they decide to go on game day on Thursday, they are caught in a situation which is going to make them lose in one aspect.” Rutherford said. “It forces them to choose between USC’s social life and USC’s academic life in a way that doesn’t happen in any other situation.”

The politics behind immigration reform and California’s changing demographics dominated the discussion over immigration policy at Wednesday’s California Policy Roundtable, which centered around the importance of immigration in the upcoming presidential election, as well as the role that California has in shaping national policy.
The event featured two Los Angeles Times reporters — Seema Mehta, a senior political reporter covering the 2016 presidential campaign, and Kate Linthicum, an immigration and politics reporter — and was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
After a brief introduction from Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur, moderators Kyla Middleton, director of political content for the Political Student Assembly, and Cindy Pineda, director of civic engagement for the Latina/o Student Assembly, took turns asking questions of the guest speakers before opening the discussion to questions from the students. The moderators focused on asking questions that would portray all sides of the immigration debate rather than aligning with a particular political party, Schnur said.
“It’s very important to listen to people with whom you don’t always agree,” Schnur said. “With these programs, we try to bring in a wide range of voices, not for a debate, but simply to give students a chance to hear from people who might have a different opinion than they do.”
Pineda, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, framed the discussion by portraying immigration as a multifaceted issue, one that is relevant to students as well as the larger community of Los Angeles and the nation as a whole.
“The availability of healthcare for undocumented immigrants and the intricacies of border security have continuously permeated the discussion,” Pineda said. “As a child of immigrant parents, I recognize the complexities that surround immigration are intersectional, and one solution is not viable to solve all the challenges that exist.”
Major issues brought up during the discussion involved each political party’s position toward immigration and, specifically, the difference between documented and undocumented immigration. Mehta pointed out that in an attempt to align themselves with voters who fear immigrants, many Republican candidates have become increasingly anti-immigrant; others, such as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, have attempted to appeal to Latino voters by adopting more moderate policies.
“This time around we have candidates talking about how a lot of [immigration policy] is family-based — your siblings, your parents — and whether we should shift that to more skills-based,” Mehta said. “There’s been more of a discussion about the legal side this time around than I’ve seen in years past.”
The issues around immigration policy and reform are especially prevalent in Los Angeles, where 3.5 million immigrants comprise 37 percent of the city’s overall population, according to data from a USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences study done by the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.
“L.A. is incredibly diverse and incredibly immigrant compared to other parts of the country, where it’s more of an abstract conversation,” Linthicum said. “Here in L.A., it’s a very crucial question, because 1 in 10 residents of L.A. County doesn’t have legal documentation. As the debate continues to rage on the national level and be unresolved and unanswered, a lot of cities and states are stepping up to either make life easier for immigrants or to make life harder.”
Ultimately, Middleton and others hope that attending events such as the California Roundtable will help students be more informed, no matter which side of the debate they end up supporting.
“These events are for all USC students to come out and understand why politics are important and the effects that it’s currently having,” Middleton said. “Since we’re all living here, it’s important to be aware of not only the debate, but of certain policy that can affect all of us.”
Let’s face the truth: Immigrants
and minorities are now a major force in America. They and the children they
bear account for 60 percent of our nation’s population growth, own 11 percent
of US businesses, and are 60 percent more likely to start a new business than
native-born Americans. In fact, forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were
started by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant, creating 10 million jobs
and seven out of ten top brands in our country. 
   More importantly, the vast majority of these
human beings—both legal and undocumented—come to improve their lives and create
a foundation of success for their children to build upon, bringing skills and a
willingness to work hard to make their dreams a reality, something our founders
did four hundred years ago. 
   However, most struggle in their efforts and
need guidance in Anytown, USA. Perhaps intelligent immigration reform, White
House/Congress and business/labor cooperation, concerned citizens and
informative books can extend a helping hand, the same unwavering hand, lest we
forget, that has been the anchor and lighthouse of American values for four
hundred years.
   A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook
that can aid immigrants and minorities and is endorsed by ambassadors,
educators, and editors: “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A
To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business,
Language and More.” 
   Here’s a closing quote from the book’s
Intro: “With all of our cultural differences though, you’ll be surprised to
learn how much…we as human beings have in common on this little third rock from
the sun. After all, the song played at our Disneyland parks around the world is
‘It’s A Small World After All.’ Peace.”

Milo Yiannopoulos, a controversial British technology and media journalist and associate editor for the London office of Breitbart.com, spoke about the counterintuitive nature of safe spaces at universities and the false narrative surrounding sexual assault and rape culture on college campuses, among other topics, Wednesday night in Kaprielian Hall.
The event was hosted by the USC College Republicans.
Jacob Ellenhorn, president of USC GOP, spoke about the significance of bringing Yiannopoulos to campus.
“He’s kind of been someone that I’ve always been watching on the media, [and I’m a] personal fan of his,” Ellenhorn said. “I think it was important for him to come to campus because I feel free speech is constantly under attack, and it’s important to bring a diverse set of voices.”
The meeting, run in a Q&A format with Ellenhorn, began with the question of whether or not students should be made to feel comfortable on their own college campuses, specifically with safe spaces.
Yiannopoulos answered that what universities are really encouraging when they create “safe spaces” is the creation of places where opinions are harmful — places where words shape reality, a “preposterous” concept invented by the left.
“Words can’t change reality, but there’s a horrible trend on campuses that words can do harm to people,” Yiannopoulos said. “It’s a ridiculous, leftist assumption.”
Yiannopoulos argued that this “toxifying of certain opinions” assaults the First Amendment. He described the attempt to build “places for those terrified by words” as anti-intellectual and completely against the purpose of university because it insulates people from opinions due to potential trauma.
An example brought up was trigger warnings, which Yiannopoulos said is another “political weapon invented by the left.” Trigger warnings — stickers or disclaimers on textbooks, articles and other academic texts — would allow students to opt out from reading them if they contain content that might cause unfavorable, emotional responses.
Yiannopoulos argued that university is for the expansion of horizons, which would be impossible if students were able to put themselves on “privileged pedestals” where they could choose not to come into contact with what upsets them.
“My basic response to this is anyone who wants a trigger warning should be immediately expelled,” Yiannopoulos said. “They’ve demonstrated that they are incapable of completing requirements of their course. They’ve chosen to use slippery and unnecessary tactics based on dodgy cognitive science to suggest that people can’t be exposed to certain ideas because they’re so hurtful or traumatic. All of this is nonsense.”
The next conversation was about the “real” internet war — not between conservatives and liberals, but between authoritarians and libertarians. Yiannopoulos argued that the general impression is that if a person is a conservative online, a liberal will find a way to illegitimately write him or her off because the left wants to control what people consume and communicate publicly.
Yiannopoulos’ incendiary language has recently drawn media attention. Last Saturday, Yiannopoulos and Rebel Media broadcaster Lauren Southern were both thrown out of the downtown Los Angeles Amber Rose SlutWalk, a movement calling for an end to rape culture, after holding up signs such as, “Regret is Not Rape” and “Rape Culture and Harry Potter: Both Fantasy.”
Yiannopoulos claimed the premise of the SlutWalk was lunacy and that the organizers of the event called the police because that is “what authoritarians do when they find they can’t win in the marketplace of ideas.”
Yiannopoulos noted a conversation with a few of the women attending the LA SlutWalk.
“[I asked], how has sexual assault personally affected you,” Yiannopoulos said. “[And she responded], ‘I can’t walk down the street without being harassed.’ It’s like, really? You’re 300 pounds. Who are you trying to kid? [Another women said], ‘My clothes should not make me a sexual object of men’s attention.’ You’re in nipple tassels. Obviously, you want to have sex with somebody.”
He went on to argue against the existence of the gender wage gap and the “rubbish” sexual assault statistics on college campuses. For the latter, Yiannopoulos said that these “1-in-5-women-type rape statistics” have wrongly become accepted truths and that rape culture at universities does not exist.
Yiannopoulos responded to a question about the lack of women in science and technology by saying that the difference was due to a statistical difference in the IQs of men and women. Women, Yiannopoulos said, tend to have IQs that cluster around the mean, while men’s tend toward the extremes of the distribution.
“More men have higher IQs, when you run the numbers, the higher someone’s IQ, the more likely it is that they’re a man,” he said.
While he acknowledged that there was disagreement among scientists over the efficacy of IQ as a measure of intelligence, he argued that success in STEM fields correlates strongly with high IQ.
“Most of the differences in STEM aren’t because men are sexist, they aren’t the result of sinister patriarchal forces, they’re not the result of stereotypes,” he said.
Regarding his provocative nature, Yiannopoulos defined his journalistic role as being a voice for those without a platform, specifically those with conservative ideology. It was a role he recognized as pitting himself against much of mainstream media and belief.
“I like big challenges,” he said. “I’m not scared of feminists, I’m not scared of progressives. I’m not scared of these people. I see them doing a huge amount of damage, and if I can help where other people can’t or won’t, then I’d love to.”
Here’s hoping for a world without Milo Yiannopoulos… or other lying, women-hating monsters like him. The sooner the better.
Your eliminationist fantasies are showing.
Actually getting rid of people with the wrong mindset (or physical characteristics) is a thing for your political side – not mine. I simply look forward to when his mindset, his misogyny, his contempt for social progress, is only found in the history books – and ONLY there.
Actually, the Marxism on which your Social Justice cult is based “got rid” of about 100 million people. The only thing you’re good at, to be honest. Your pathetic attempts to silence people by screaming “misogynist” at them is not particularly impressive – more like pitiful. It’s rather obvious that you couldn’t win an actual debate.
“Misogynist” is simply an objective description of a person’s based on his or hers ideas regarding a group of people. Same as “racist” or “bigot”, – or any other words that neoreactionaries find so annoying because they accurately describe them. 
Also. I don’t think you should accuse others of using words to “silence” people, while defending a man who tries to shame women from speaking on serious issues, based on their size or clothes. At least if you want any pretense of there being coherent logic behind your ideas (i.e. unless you want yourself revealed for the double standard spewing hypocrite you are).
“”Misogynist” is simply an objective description of a person’s based on his or hers ideas regarding a group of people. ”
Before trying to pretend that the hateful labels you fling at people are ‘objective’, perhaps you should overcome the more basic challenge of writing properly. Or don’t they teach you that in Gender Studies?
” Same as “racist” or “bigot”, – or any other words that neoreactionaries find so annoying because they accurately describe them.”
Not really. You know a screeching, blue-haired SJW is losing a debate when he starts screaming “bigot” or “reactionary” at you. Which is always, because you never have any arguments.
” while defending a man who tries to shame women from speaking on serious issues, based on their size or clothes.”
On their size? You mean height? No, of course not, you mean morbid obesity, the kind that is extremely dangerous to people’s health. You know, people die because the likes of you keep encouraging them to be unhealthy and obese, instead of telling them the hard truth that being fat is unhealthy.
And no, if you’re 300 pounds, only chubby-chasing SJW ‘men’ will be interested in you. Yeah, you’re not going to convince me that anyone is cat-calling you.
“My basic response to this is anyone who wants a trigger warning should be immediately expelled,” Yiannopoulos said. 
[Sarcasm] No, that doesn’t sound authoritarian at all. Real champion of free speech there.[/Sarcasm]
I get the feeling that Milo doesn’t understand the concept of “safe places.” There are not places designed to suppress opinions and discussion, but rather to allow such without fear of personal attack. They are to encourage conversation by providing safe forums for those usually excluded.
I think he knows better than you what safe space policies entail, as he has been the victim of one.
—
After barring Julie Bindel from a debate on censorship planned for mid-October, the Students’ Union have now told Milo Yiannopoulos that he is also prohibited from attending
In their initial statement the Students’ Union Executive Team rejected Bindel on the grounds that her appearance would be “potentially in breach of [the] safe space policy.”
I’m not saying that all safe spaces are all executed well. What they are supposed to be and how they are realized often differ.
Being a victim of a safe space? I think such an exclusion represents a lack of trust and faith that someone can participate in a meaningful discussion. There’s nothing that I’ve read from Milo that would indicate to me that he could add to a conversation.
He’s only a victim of his own inability to participate and articulate his thoughts in a tactful and non-inflammatory manner, as far as I’m concerned.
” I think such an exclusion represents a lack of trust and faith that someone can participate in a meaningful discussion.”
You just claimed that “safe spaces” are not intended to suppress opinion and discussion. Then you admit that they are designed to do exactly that. 
Trigger warnings and safe spaces are indications that someone is not fit for college, which after all is about inquiry, not indoctrination. At least, it’s supposed to be.
huh?
“You just claimed that “safe spaces” are not intended to suppress opinion and discussion. Then you admit that they are designed to do exactly that.”
Not at all. Safe spaces are designed to foster opinion and discussion. That means all the participants need to be able to have a reasonable discourse. With statements like “You’re 300 pounds. Who are you trying to kid?” or “More men have higher IQs” I certainly wouldn’t trust Milo to contribute in a meaningful way without the conversation turning toxic.
There are ways to discuss this topics and there are important things to say about them. Milo doesn’t seem to understand how to talk about this stuff. If I wanted to have a serious conversation, he’s not someone I would invite.
” Safe spaces are designed to foster opinion and discussion. ”
Yeah, the opinions of radical feminists who attack scientists for wearing a shirt, while silencing anyone who disagrees with these people.
“I certainly wouldn’t trust Milo to contribute in a meaningful way without the conversation turning toxic.”
Well, you certainly can’t trust Milo to adhere to your feminist “fat acceptance”  movement, or their pseudo-scientific claims that everything is a social construct. That is why you want to silence him.
” If I wanted to have a serious conversation, he’s not someone I would invite.”
That is because you are not actually interested in a conversation, hence your attempts to silence anyone who disagrees with your Social Justice agenda.
Some very interesting interpretations of my thoughts. Not correct. But interesting.
Let’s face it. The internet is not a “Safe Space.” There were plenty of people talking about the shirt and many terrible things said by more than a few. That’s why we need “safe spaces.” So that we can have tough conversations without fear of attack.
I have no desire to silence Milo. He can talk all he wants, just as people can refuse or decide provide him a forum. I just wouldn’t expect to have a serious conversation about these issues with him. I am happy to engage with people of differing opinions provided the conversation doesn’t turn personal (as this one is starting to). Differing opinions open my eyes to new ideas and push me to expand my own boundaries. I actually go and seek them out, professionally and personally.
But I really want to have a civil conversation, where people debate ideas with facts and well constructed arguments instead of put downs and other personal attacks.
Let’s look at this statement. 
“That is because you are not actually interested in a conversation, hence your attempts to silence anyone who disagrees with your Social Justice agenda.”
Unless you have telepathy, you really can’t tell me what I’m interested in. If you do have telepathy, then it’s not working very well. Reading a statement like that pretty much shuts down any additional conversation. I’ve been cast as an SJW who won’t listen to reason. Let’s not mention that I personally identify as a Social Justice Rogue and that I really haven’t seen an reason or well constructed arguments in this thread.
I’ll be bowing out of this conversation, now.
I, for one, am a Social Justice Paladin.
“There were plenty of people talking about the shirt and many terrible things said by more than a few. That’s why we need “safe spaces.” So that we can have tough conversations without fear of attack.”
You need safe spaces, because otherwise, you can’t attack scientists without people criticizing you? Sounds about right. You want to call people every name in the book, but you don’t want to be held accountable for your hatred.
“I have no desire to silence Milo.”
You just endorsed a Student Union banning him from participating in a university debate, because you believe in “Safe Spaces” where special snowflakes can’t be criticized.
“But I really want to have a civil conversation, where people debate ideas with facts and well constructed arguments instead of put downs and other personal attacks.”
You might want to look at your own side, because it constantly engages in personal attacks against people who disagree with them. 
“Unless you have telepathy, you really can’t tell me what I’m interested in.”
I can base it on the opinions you have voiced here, and since you have advocated silencing people who disagree with you, it’s pretty obvious to me that you are not interested in having a conversation, except with people who already agree with you. 
” Let’s not mention that I personally identify as a Social Justice Rogue”
That’s sad.
Milo is my gay savior. I just wish I was a young hung gay black man. Unfortunately I’m neither.
I thought we were gonna hear tips about how to dodge out of paying employees.
This person is just a professional shittalker. Moving on.
If anyone wondered, yes, this guy is a fan of the notorious con artist and liar Anita Sarkeesian.
Talking about professional shittalkers.
So people support a guy who called Laverne Cox a man, tried to claim Shaun King was white based on the word of Joshua Goldberg, and said “if you’ve heard about a rape, it’s fake.”
That’s not “conservative.” That’s being a horrid little cretin.
Hahaha, after so many far-leftists have been blown out of the water by claiming that Shaun King being white had anything to do with Joshua Goldberg, they keep repeating the claim.
You really are like creationists. Except even more intellectually dishonest.
Shaun King is white. Get over it. His mom didn’t cheat on a random guy he knows nothing about, other than that he’s black. That’s absurd.
Oh hey, it’s an angry Gamergate person. I’ve never seen one in the wild before.
Riigght, because anyone who disagrees must be one of those horrid gamers. You pathetic losers see the whole world through your victim lens.  Keep bending over and crying to your mommies, but don’t be surprised when nobody gives you your blankie.
Gamergaters =/= Gamers.
Take it from the avid gamer Florence, the self-proclaimed “Social Justice Paladin” (white knight) who spends most of his time playing Depression Quest.
Actually, Florence, the self-proclaimed “Social Justice Paladin” (more of a silvery grey knight, really) spends most of her time playing Western RPGs like the Shadowrun series. She is also fond of Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim, though she wishes that Majesty 2, with its superior gameplay, had the custom map feature of the original game, and that the Kingmaker and Battles of Ardania expansions didn’t suck so much. She also enjoys Starcraft 2, but her computer is kind of shit right now, since her good one died. She has not, in fact, played Depression Quest, but also does not understand the irrational rage it induces from insecure male gamers, since the game isn’t even about feminism, but surmises that it probably has something to do with their tiny joysticks.
” She has not, in fact, played Depression Quest, but also does not understand the irrational rage it induces from insecure male gamers”
So… you’re a misogynist who thinks that women are too stupid to see how dumb Depression Quest is? Rest assured that there are plenty who are brighter than you.
“since the game isn’t even about feminism”
Actually, it is. Most feminists are depressed, which is why they are so shrill and hateful.
“but surmises that it probably has something to do with their tiny joysticks.”
Brought to you by the ‘body acceptance’ and ‘obesity is healthy’ crowd. Oops.
Okay, seriously. Your trolling was fun at first, but at this point its just sad. You could at least TRY to keep up the facade of being serious. Ah well, was fun while it lasted! Social Justice Paladin, signing out!
No, HERE is why “most feminists” are the way they are (not that you know how they are):
Pretty sure you were the one who was outraged about Milo. Did you forget so soon?
Milo will save the White race with his fabulous hair.
Milo is such a refreshing breath of air after all the drivel we usually here on campuses. Also I’m glad that USC allowed him to speak considering a few other unis have kicked him out.
This whole article is full of crap and nothing on God’s green earth is going to make me think half of what this he is saying is true. I understand that he’s speaking his mind and being open, but what he’s saying is just straight up outlandish. Its all bullcrap. 
You sound really triggered. So much so that you mess up your grammar and can’t make a proper argument, though perhaps that is normal by your standards.
Shit man… better go run to the diaper changing… er.. safe space!
Consider the source!  Milo isn’t exactly respected by any rational people, is he?
Thank you Milo for being a voice of reason. Hopefully more people will be emboldened to speak as openly and frankly as you.
I couldn’t figure out the authors opinion, which means you did a good job…bravo. 
Good journalism is a joy to read !
On the whole, an outstanding article. Almost never see such balanced, fair reporting today.

Cutthroat competitor · USC chef Mikery Hatfield competed on Food Network’s reality TV show Cutthroat Kitchen last Sunday. – Photo courtesy of USC News
It should come as no surprise that a chef would begin an interview by presenting a dish — and Chef Mikery Hatfield did not disappoint, bringing out fresh sesame and black pepper — crusted ahi tuna, seared rare, over Thai marinated vegetables and slices of grilled pineapple.
Hatfield described the components of the dish using words such as “vibrant” and “pop,” gesturing with his hands as he explained that the Thai vegetables add a subtle spiciness to the palate and that the decidedly “un-fishy” taste of the tuna indicates its freshness. Dipping a piece of tuna into Sriracha to “add a little bit of kick,” he added wistfully that he’ll be sad to see the dish leave the menu.
“But you know, everything comes to an end,” Hatfield said. “As a chef, you can’t rest on your laurels. We had a great run, it was a good dish, but we have a lot of regulars, and they get to the point where they say, ’What have you done for me lately?’”
Hatfield, who works as the head chef at McKay’s Restaurant at the Radisson Hotel, is no stranger to innovation. Over the summer, he unveiled a chicken and waffle burger and took home a seventh-place award from the Better Burger Project, a nationwide competition to incorporate mushrooms into a burger recipe. He’s constantly re-evaluating McKay’s menu, experimenting with new recipes and putting interesting twists on old favorites. And on Sunday, he made his debut on national television as a contestant on the Food Network reality cooking show Cutthroat Kitchen.
The show brings together four chefs who have to go through a series of challenges and are eliminated one by one. Each chef starts out with $25,000 to purchase items in an auction, which can be used to sabotage other chefs. However, at the end of the show, the last chef standing will walk away with only the money he or she has left over. Hatfield’s episode, “Electric Boo-Galoo,” was Halloween themed,  which proved challenging when Hatfield was “sabotaged” and had to wear a Frankenstein mask, forcing him to prepare food on top of his head.
“I was like MacGyver,” Hatfield said. “I used one of the polished serving domes as a mirror in order to be able to see, and I put a sheet pan underneath me so anytime I cut something it would fall into the pan.”
Hatfield stressed that despite the comedic nature of the challenges on the show, his experience there was not too far from his real-life job as a chef.
“A day in the life of any chef is ‘figure it out’ because it’s never going to go the way you planned. I employed that type of ingenuity, and that’s how I was able to get it done,” Hatfield said. “You have to use a little ingenuity, a little MacGyver, a little prayer, whatever it takes.”
Though Hatfield was eliminated after the first round, he felt proud that he was able to create a product that stood on its own despite the challenges that he faced. Ultimately, he also felt grateful to have been able to interact with his competitors, who all supported each other off-camera despite their on-camera rivalry.
“We just got a good mix [of people],” Hatfield said. “Even during the interaction, everyone was cordial and friendly.”
At first, Hatfield was hesitant to participate, but when he finally got the casting call and went to the taping in January, he brought all of the skills he had amassed over a long culinary career. A Los Angeles native, Hatfield graduated from the culinary school at the Los Angeles Trade Technical College in 1998 and spent the next year and a half as an intern at the Century Plaza Hotel, preparing food for patrons from Bill Clinton to Ronald Reagan. He spent years at movie studios, from Sony Pictures to Warner Brothers, working his way up to the position of sous chef before taking his first executive sous chef job at Petco Stadium in San Diego, home of the San Diego Padres. Hatfield said coming to USC in 2011, however, was like “coming home” — even though getting here took a long journey.
“I’ve always wanted to work at ’SC, and I applied over the years several times, but I think more than ever that this was the perfect time [to start]. Because we’re all about the best USC experience, and I bring so many years of really specific experience with me now, that obviously I did not have years before when I applied to work at USC,” Hatfield.
Hatfield’s drive to innovate has been his most prominent quality since his first days in the industry. He still remembers, in an effort to master his craft, staying up all night baking cheesecakes in culinary school and distributing them to his neighbors because he ran out of room in his one-bedroom apartment.
“I said that if I’m going to be the chef that I want to be, there can’t be anything in the food service operation that I don’t know, that I don’t have the mastery of,” Hatfield said.
Today, that drive for constant improvement inspires him to craft his menu as a reflection of that excellence. But despite his position as head chef, he never forgets his audience.
“I called the dish ‘Tuna Thai’d,’” he said. “I try to make it fun. That’s the reaction I want when people sit down at my restaurant, like, ‘Oh, I get it.’ And then they see the plate and they go, ‘Wow.’”

Family, trust and volleyball keep native Italian Alice Pizzasegola motivated and focused on the court.
Pizzasegola, an international relations major from Rivergaro, Italy, is the junior setter on the women’s volleyball team.
For Pizzasegola, college is a world away from her hometown. Coming from a town with just fewer than 7,000 people, Pizzasegola had to adjust to a university with more than 40,000 students. She also moved halfway across the world — just over 6,000 miles — to a place she had never been.
For most students, touring his or her future college is a must, but Pizzasegola’s only experience with USC came from many internet searches.
“I didn’t really know what to expect,” she said. “But I think I made the best choice I could ever make.”
Despite being in a foreign place for college, Pizzasegola was able to find comfort in former setter Hayley Crone, who graduated last year. When Pizzasegola was a freshman, Crone was a junior. Crone served as a mentor to her both on and off the court
“She was amazing to me,” Pizzasegola said. “She was like my big sister.”
Now a junior herself, Pizzasegola is doing the same with freshman setter Baylee Johnson. She sees Johnson as strong and hopes she’s giving her what’s essential.
“I’ll always be here for her if she needs anything,” Pizzasegola said.
As an upperclassman, Pizzasegola wants to be more than just a mentor to her fellow setter; she wants to be the teammate that everyone can trust.
“If [they] have a problem, [they] can come talk to me,” she said. “I really like listening to people.”
Pizzasegola sees this year’s team as a family. The team’s cohesiveness has helped bring them success.
Before every match, the setter has a specific moment when she is standing with her team on the court while the national anthem plays. She looks up at the American flag and her teammates around her and remembers why she is here. She said it serves as her motivation to leave everything out on the court.
“I should give my teammates, my family and myself the best effort to get what I want,” Pizzasegola said. “So I might as well just try as hard as I can.”
It’s more than just the team’s newfound motivation that is helping their success. Pizzasegola pointed out that the high level of trust between her teammates on the court is what fuels their dominance.
“It’s just like a circle of trust,” she said. “If I don’t trust my passer and don’t trust my hitter, I am not going to give my best set.”
By the way that Pizzasegola values her relationships and trust with her teammates, it’s no surprise  how much she values her actual family as well.
Being so far from home, she rarely gets to see her family. She gets to travel back home twice a year: for Christmas after the season is over and in the spring after finals. Her parents, Tiziano and Roberta Pizzasegola, also have the chance to come out and see their daughter during the season.
Her dad comes out during Thanksgiving to spend the holiday with her. Her mom is a teacher, making it a bit harder for her to come out and watch her daughter, but she still finds the time.
She also has an older brother, Filippo. He was able to come out and visit her last spring for Pizzasegola’s birthday. He ended up liking USC so much that he said he could see himself coming out here to study for a master’s.
Away from the court, Pizzasegola loves spending her free time at the beach.
“I just love the water, it makes me really calm, relaxed and quiet,” she said.
From a young age, being in the water was a part of Pizzasegola’s life.
“My mom just threw me into the water,” Pizzasegola said. “I loved staying in.”
Though she doesn’t get many chances to get back in the pool — especially during the season — Pizzasegola was able to last spring. After practices, she would spend about 30 minutes swimming in the pool.
Around the age of 10, Pizzasegola wanted to play a sport where she could play on a team. And volleyball provided that for her.
“I realized I think I need to play with someone,” she said.
Though she continued to grow with volleyball, playing in the U.S. wasn’t something that Pizzasegola thought about until she met a volleyball player who went to Stanford and played professionally in Italy.
“It was really unexpected,” Pizzasegola said. “But what I found was really amazing.”
In her three years at USC, she’s come to learn the differences between Italian and American volleyball. In the U.S. — especially at USC — volleyball is treated as more than just a sport. Coaches place a greater emphasis on making sure their players are growing academically and as people rather than just in volleyball techniques. Pizzasegola values these contrasts.
“They’re trying to give you an education,” Pizzasegola said. “Not just in school,but for life.”
She said what really made her love playing volleyball at USC was the feeling that she wasn’t just playing for herself, but for her teammates and the Trojan Family.
“This feeling of spirit that you’re playing for your college,” Pizzasegola said. “It’s just like a big family.”
Pizzasegola has created some of her fondest memories during her time at USC, and with the team recently earning its top national rankings, she has her sights set high for both herself and her teammates.
“I know what being No. 1 means,” Pizzasegola said. “It’s probably the best feeling I’ve ever had volleyball-wise.”
Individually, she wants to keep improving and learning to read the game better. She believes her team can go quite far this season.
“We want to win the conference first,” Pizzasegola said. “Then the National Championship second.”
Though this team has the potential to have a big season, they’re taking it one point at a time. They’re focused on always staying on top of their game.
“It’s always fun in practice,” Pizzasegola. “We are always competing.”
The women’s volleyball team will next head out on the road to Colorado and Utah, hoping to keep their undefeated record and top ranking intact.

Blake wants to cruise in an RV across Australia. Lachlan thinks the idea is dreadful. Lachlan loves listening to Taylor Swift. Blake thinks she’s awful. The Edwards brothers are two of USC’s top aquatic athletes. But though they share a love for the sport and for each other, they couldn’t be more different.
Blake is a 23-year-old junior transfer from Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. Lachlan is a 20-year-old sophomore who was recruited by USC straight out of high school and spent last year playing for the Trojans.
The two have spent many years playing water polo together. They grew up by the pool, as their mother and father represented Australia in swimming and water polo, respectively.
Blake started playing water polo as a 12 year old, when his older brothers began their careers, and Lachlan started at the same time as an 8-year-old. The two are the third and fifth brothers in a family of aquatic athletes.
Five of the brothers started for the same Melbourne Collegians club team in what was a season unlike anything most athletes or siblings could ever hope to experience.
“For me, it was one of my most memorable water polo experiences — that camaraderie  that we developed from knowing each other,” Blake said. “It was just a really rewarding experience to be out there and to share something with your brothers.”
Both brothers are members of the Australian National Team, so they have been able to travel to many places in Asia and Eastern Europe.  However, one place water polo had never taken the Edwards’ before USC was the United States.
Their perception of America was taken straight from Hollywood. Blake confessed he loved watching the TV show The O.C.
“My dream is to have a girl on the back of my bike, riding on the boardwalk,” he said.
Not only are the two countries’ cultures different, but both brothers also acknowledged that the transition from Australian universities was very challenging because the student body is much more disengaged and the learning more theoretical on their home continent.
“I find that the way it’s set up here with everyone on campus sets up more opportunities to network and meet people,” Blake said.  “The learning is much more engaging and enjoyable.”
Though the brothers are good at coexisting in the pool, they aren’t so used to being forced to do so outside of it.  Currently, Blake and Lachlan are sharing a room, something they haven’t had to do since before they were five.
“We fought a lot more back home. Usually he is the grumpiest man back home, and I’m always annoying him … now that we’re in the same room, he hasn’t really got a choice,” Blake said.  “We’re still in the honeymoon stage.”
Even the honeymoon stage of a relationship has its tense points, though.  Blake described a wrong turn he made in L.A. that gave him an eye-opening look at some of the more interesting parts of Los Angeles.  Lachlan shook his head and expressed how happy he was that he missed out on that quasi-adventure.
And though the brothers share a room, they do not share a taste in music.
“You listen to all crap, like all ’80s stuff,” Lachlan said to Blake. “There’s a time and a place for that, and he cannot pick when that should be played.”
Blake responded disapprovingly by telling his brother that he listens to a lot of teenage girl music.
“It’s the best stuff,” Lachlan replied.
When their time at USC comes to a close and the brothers are back down under, both would like to spend time seeing more of Australia, however Blake’s desired surfing road trip in an RV isn’t for everyone.
“That’s where we’re the opposite,” Lachlan said.  “It’d be good to see that stuff, but a year in a truck with him, I don’t know about that.”
In the meantime, the brothers said their biggest goal is to win a national championship for USC, something they said their connection might help them to do.
“I seem to find him a lot easier,” Blake said. “I don’t know if it’s because of the size of him but that’s the way it’s always happened.  I understand him and his abilities a lot more, and he understands mine as well.”
The brothers will continue their water polo career together, both in and out of the pool.  They will look to lead USC to another national title, something they say shouldn’t be too hard.
“There’s no one closer than your family, so when I’m successful and able to share it with him, it’s something I can’t describe,” Lachlan said. “Seeing him be successful and play well, you get the same feeling if it was you doing it.”
Excellent article!  Loved it!

Being blind is supposed to be a hindrance, a deterrence that takes away your vision, your future, your dreams.
But don’t tell that to Jake Olson, a freshman long snapper on the football team who has no eyesight but plenty of determination.
When head coach Steve Sarkisian called on him to deliver his first snap during a live field goal drill at practice one Wednesday morning a few weeks ago, Olson jumped right in.
“I felt ready,” Olson said. “It was something I did thousands of times. It was not letting the situation get in your head … Just do the same thing you always do.”
That mindset has pushed Olson through life, helping him cope and overcome obstacles that come with being blind.
Born and raised in nearby Huntington Beach, Olson was diagnosed with retinoblastoma, a rare form of eye cancer at birth. The tumor spread fast and caused him to lose his left eye at just 10 months, but doctors were initially able to salvage his right eye.
However, throughout the next 12 years, the cancer came back time and time again — eight occurrences in all. Olson exhausted nearly every treatment — chemotherapy, laser, radiation, chirotherapy — but the tumor was persistent. Fearing the cancer would spread to the brain, doctors had no choice but to remove vision in Olson’s right eye as well.
So, at the age of 12, Olson faced a daunting, unnerving reality.
“It was scary and overwhelming because I was like, ‘How am I going to walk? How am I going to know where I’m going? How am I going to text? How am I going to eat? How am I going to do all these easy things?’” Olson said. “You really have to relearn how to do them.”
Before the procedure, though, Olson received an invitation to hang out with the USC football team from then-head coach Pete Carroll.
At first, Olson thought he was simply going to watch the team practice. But it turned out to be the full package — Olson did everything with the team from eating dinner to sitting next to Carroll on the team bus. Olson’s final night prior to surgery was spent at the USC practice field with Carroll and the team raising his spirits and wishing him the best.
“It really made me part of the team, and I felt like how I feel now … the camaraderie and the brotherhood and the support you get with being on the football team,” Olson said. “During that time of my life when I was going to confront going blind, it really meant a lot to have that love there.”
After the procedure, Olson continued to play flag football in middle school, which he said was not overly taxing. But high school football at Orange Lutheran — a state powerhouse — was too much of an injury risk for him, and Olson reluctantly sat out his freshman and sophomore years.
The competitive itch tore at him. He missed being on the field and having fun with his teammates. So he decided to try out for the only position in football that didn’t require sight: long-snapper. He spent every day for three months over the summer learning the position from scratch.
“When I first started I couldn’t snap the ball,” Olson said. “I didn’t know what the heck I was doing. It took two or three months of really practicing hard to start seeing some progress.”
But he made incredible progress, and when the school year started, Olson became the starting long snapper on the varsity football team.
“It was cool to see the practice pay off, but it was also being on the field and knowing I was contributing,” Olson said.
Olson has also found time to serve as an inspiration to others. Since his story became public, Olson has received numerous speaking requests. His foundation, Out of Sight Faith, raises money for blind kids to receive the necessary technology to succeed in the classroom. He has written two books, the first when he was just eight years old and the second in 2013, titled Open Your Eyes: 10 Uncommon Lessons to Discover a Happier Life.
“There are a bunch of principles in there that can apply to any circumstance,” Olson said on the book, which he co-wrote with leadership coach McKay Christensen. “Just getting through adversity and how to live a happier life. It’s a very inspiring book, and that’s what I’m about — helping people and inspiring them.”
Olson said that in facing adversity it’s important to always push forward and he advises other kids growing up blind to do the same.
“The only thing that’s going to stop you from getting to your true potential is you,” Olson said. “And so find a will, find a way to get things done and get to where you want to be. And trust me, when you do, it’s going to be so satisfying.”
Growing up a die-hard USC fan, his choice for college was a no-brainer. Olson was awarded with the Swim With Mike Scholarship, which funds physically challenged athletes, and he is settling in at USC. He uses his guide dog, Quebec, to get around. Still, there are daily challenges that range from walking to class to brushing his teeth.
“I’ll never say that you cannot do anything, but I will say that it does take an extra step of thinking and being creative in ways to find how to do it,” Olson said. “It doesn’t mean you can’t do it. It’s just a little difficult to just do normal things like walk or do homework or figure out which toothpaste is on your toothbrush.”
If there is a silver lining, Olson said it’s that being blind has given him the chance to appreciate others truly for who they are and not their appearances.
“Sight can really deceive you at times,” Olson said. “Not being able to see has allowed me to view people for who they are. I think that’s a really cool thing. If you ask me, it really isn’t about how someone looks.”
Olson cites his faith in God and his support system of family and friends as his main inspirations. But the motivation goes both ways — Olson said he feeds off others who look up to him, too.
“People tell me how much I inspire them,” Olson said. “But in turn that inspires me because I know that I’m making an impact. That’s what helps me keep going, just knowing that I’m making an impact in people’s lives.”
This positive mindset has gotten Olson to his dream scenario, wearing the cardinal and gold on Saturday nights.
“I’m on the team that I admired for so many years,” he said. “I was so excited [to put on the Trojan uniform]. I couldn’t believe what I was wearing. The first day and the last day, it’s going to be the same feeling of, ‘This is a blessing.’”
His teammates, while attentive to his needs, treat Olson like just another player, which Olson says is a “great mix.” Growing up a die-hard Trojans fan not far from the Coliseum, he said that it is surreal to head out of the tunnel as part of the team.
“I always pictured myself as a kid up there looking down at the players in uniform and admiring them,” Olson said. “And so when I’m in uniform down there, I can only imagine … I’m one of those guys now, which is a crazy thing to think about.”
Which brings us back to that practice a few weeks ago on a Wednesday morning, with Olson receiving the call to take his first live snap. With players, coaches and media watching, Olson calmly stepped up and delivered the snap. Not surprisingly, it was perfect, and the field goal was good, prompting a celebration and good feelings all around, a group of star athletes in solidarity with a blind kid from Huntington Beach living out his dream, continuing to say “yes” when everything around him kept screaming “no.”
“It was a cool moment for everyone out there,” Olson said. “It was awesome.”

Olvera Street in Downtown LA is one fun destination you should visit this weekend. Flickr/CreativeCommons
As one of the most vibrant cities in the world, Los Angeles has plenty of exciting things to do and places to visit. If you don’t know about them already, consider this list a guide for finding some interesting activities to do this weekend in L.A.:
1. Visit The Broad, L.A.’s Newest Contemporary Art museum

It’s a brisk fall Saturday morning during a bye week for USC, and Athletic Director Pat Haden can be found working out on his treadmill at home, doing what most people expect him to be doing — watching college football.
“I bet I spend about 20 hours a week watching games,” Haden said.
Every college student might wish they could be as effective of a multitasker as the 62-year-old Haden, who is now in his sixth year as the athletic director of his alma mater.
And if the job of juggling 21 intercollegiate sports here at USC wasn’t tough enough, Haden also evaluates the entire college football landscape every week as a member of the College Football Playoff Selection Committee.
Beginning the first week of November, Haden, who along with University of Wisconsin Athletic Director Barry Alvarez primarily focuses on the Atlantic Coast Conference, will join the rest of the Committee in Dallas, Texas; to produce the first edition of this year’s playoff rankings.
“I look at all the teams and rank them according to five or six metrics that I have,” Haden said. “It takes up a lot of time.”
If the Trojans are being discussed, though, Haden said that he has to recuse himself from the conversation.
“The idea is to get recused a lot because it means they’re talking about your school,” Haden said.
The act of maintaining equilibrium in his commitments is nothing new to Haden, who has essentially  been doing so for the majority of his life.
During his college-playing days at USC, Haden was a member of two national championship teams and was the Co-MVP of the 1975 Rose Bowl, all while working his way to two Academic All-American honors and graduating from the University magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.
Then as a Rhodes Scholar, Haden played professional football for the Southern California Sun of the World Football League for a year, then for the St. Louis Rams while studying economics at Oxford.
He was the epitome of the balanced student-athlete, and in his first five years as athletic director he has sought out to put his student-athletes in a favorable position to do the same by prioritizing academia, community service and athletic performance.
“In all three areas, we’ve done a lot, and we’re proud of that,” Haden said. “Everything about the University is on an upswing; and we need to be in the Athletic Department as good or try to be better than the rest of the University. That’s what we wake up every morning trying to do, and it’s a real challenge.”
Taking care of student-athletes has been a prime concern for Haden during his tenure. USC was the first university in the Pac-12 and second in the country to offer guaranteed four-year scholarships and also spends more money on the additional food benefit for student-athletes than anyone in the conference, according to Haden.
“We will do as much as we possibly can for our student-athletes,” Haden said.
This seemingly wasn’t the case when Haden was brought in to succeed Mike Garrett back in 2010, which was just the beginning of a tumultuous journey for USC amid the cloud of NCAA sanctions.
“I stepped into a bit of mess and felt that we really needed to reboot virtually everything and adopt this mantra of ‘continuous improvement,’” Haden said.
Since Haden took over, Athletics has produced 274 first-team All-Americans, 32 individual national champions and 10 team national titles. Meanwhile, he oversaw an increase in GPA, graduation rates and community service, in addition to the building of numerous facilities including the John McKay Center, Uytengsu Aquatics Center and Merle Norman Stadium for beach volleyball, among others.
After inheriting the Coliseum’s lease in 2013, the Athletic Department’s next big project is to revamp the historic stadium, according to Haden.
Of course, the Coliseum continues to house the No. 17-ranked USC football team. Haden believes the Trojans should be as talented as any team they face this year, but points out the increased talent and depth of the Pac-12 Conference, which has made it difficult for USC to reclaim its status as a perennial powerhouse.
“It’s a different era than  a few years ago when there weren’t a lot of good teams in the Pac-12,” Haden said. “I really believe that the Pac-12 South is not going to be decided until the last game of the year.”
When asked how many years he has left in the tank as Athletic director, the 62-year-old said that he honestly didn’t have an answer and rather than honing in on any type of legacy, he wants the focus to remain on improving USC Athletics.
“I’m not interested in the legacy of Pat Haden,” Haden said. “I want us to continue to improve, and I don’t feel like I need to be remembered for anything. Somebody’s going to take my place and continue to do this job and do it better than I — that’s the idea.”

Student-athletes everywhere are expected to shoulder the workload of their academic peers while traveling across the country and  representing their school on the field.
It’s amazing that these athletes have the time to finish their homework, let alone study for quizzes, midterms and finals.
As we approach Thursday night’s game against the Washington Huskies, I ask: Where is the line between student and athlete?
As the Trojans prepare to face the Huskies tonight, it’s safe to assume that the football players will not be attending class. Since the Trojans have practice in the mornings on weekdays, most student-athletes have class in the afternoons and evenings. With a 6 p.m. kickoff, there’s no chance that players will have an opportunity to attend those classes.
Luckily for the Trojans, they will have played three weeknight games in a row at home. If they were playing on the road, they would most certainly have to miss at least one or two extra days of class.
If you’re a USC student, then many of you know that we are currently in the middle of midterm season. This means there’s a pretty good chance that some players will be forced to miss midterms, an injustice to both the student-athlete and their peers.
Recently, UCLA’s head coach Jim Mora brought up the topic of weeknight games. His team will face back-to-back Thursday night games after a bye this week. Mora was not happy with whomever was in charge of UCLA’s schedule.
After his team’s loss to Arizona State, Mora went on a rant about how the scheduling was an injustice to his players. “It’s unbelievable we’re calling these kids student-athletes,” Mora said. “Yet we force them to miss six days of school.”
Mora has a great point. How can anyone expect a student to keep up with his or her classes if he or she is forced to miss six days of school? Even I can’t imagine what missing three consecutive days of classes would feel like.
Most skeptics will point out that student-athletes are at a university to play sports and eventually go pro. However, the reality is that most players will never go professional in their sport, especially  football.
There are currently 99 players listed on the Trojans’ roster, according to USCTrojans.com. The chances of all 99 players going professional are slim to none.
Though other sports, such as volleyball and soccer, are faced with weeknight games, they are not affected as much as football. This is mainly because their games are usually scheduled for Friday and Sunday nights. Preparation for football is also drastically different than for  other sports. I remember in high school, our football  team would meet at 3 p.m. to start preparing for a 7 p.m. game.
Weeknight football games also put pressure on students to skip class in order to go watch the game they paid for. I know I am not alone as the only person who has class during the football game. Luckily, my class is partially online, so the professor assigned us work to have done by Thursday instead of meeting in class. However, I’m sure that other teachers were not so willing to cut class because of a football game.
After all, the main point of attending school is for the education, not for football.
Weeknight games are a new concept as networks look for ways to increase their revenue. The Trojans didn’t play their first weeknight game until 2006, but they have played on a weeknight every season since. With the creation of the Pac-12 network and subsequent deals with Fox Sports and ESPN, weeknight games are not going anywhere.
Similarly to how the NFL is extending its audience by adding Thursday Night Football, ESPN and Fox are hoping to accomplish the same thing with Thursday night college games. Unfortunately, these networks are more concerned with the athlete aspect of the term student-athlete.
Until the University decides to step up and defend the student, networks will continue to schedule weeknight games. This means student-athletes are faced with an even harder task of balancing sports and academics.
Someone needs to remind these networks and universities that school comes first, not sports.

After a blowout win in Tempe followed by a bye week, the Trojans will return to the Coliseum on Thursday to host the Washington Huskies. The teams have not met since 2012 when USC beat Washington 24-14.
The Trojans are 3-1 heading into the matchup while the Huskies are 2-2. Each team has a loss in the Pac-12, as the Trojans fell to the Cardinal in Week 3 and the Huskies lost to Cal the following week.
Head coach Steve Sarkisian will be facing his former team for the first time. Five members of Sarkisian’s coaching staff also coached at Washington. Sarkisian will face fellow second-year head coach Chris Petersen, who previously led a Boise State team that became a powerhouse during his tenure.
Sarkisian is adamant that Thursday night’s game is no different from any other, and he is focused on winning a game against a Pac-12 opponent.
“I’m a firm believer that it’s about us, about focusing on us,” Sarkisian said. “You have to practice what you preach. Everybody understands that I was the head coach at University of Washington for five years, but that doesn’t make me want to win more Thursday night. Shoot, I want to win every game.”
Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler will be matched up against a true freshman in Jake Browning, who will be making his Pac-12 road debut on Thursday. Browning has passed for five touchdowns for nearly 1,000 yards and four interceptions. Kessler, on the other hand, has three times as many touchdown passes for 1,297 yards and a lone interception. Kessler had five touchdowns against Arizona State alone.
That’s not to say that Browning isn’t capable of leading his team to a win, though. He is the first true freshman to start at quarterback for Washington since Marques Tuiasosopo, current USC tight end coach, in 1997. He has completed 65 percent of his passes through his first four games as quarterback.
He will, however, face a solid Trojan defense that has only allowed three touchdown passes all season. Senior cornerback Kevon Seymour will return after missing the previous two games with an injured knee and will add pressure to Browning. He’ll be joined by sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, who adds depth to the secondary.
The defense will need to watch out for Washington receiver Jaydon Mickens, who had originally committed to USC before enrolling at Washington. He recently moved into fifth place on Washington’s all-time receptions list.
Though the Trojans have maintained a stout pass defense, they have allowed 164 yards per game on the ground. Nose tackle and captain Antwaun Woods will return to the lineup on Thursday after sitting out against Arizona State due to a shoulder injury and will bring much-needed experience to the rush defense. Washington, however, has a very young offensive line that lacks the experience to exploit USC’s defensive weaknesses.
Kessler will face a Washington defense that leads the Pac-12 in total defense and ranks in the top 20 nationally in scoring and rushing defense. Kessler and his offense, however, lead the conference in scoring, passing efficiency, passing touchdowns and completion percentage. Kessler’s offensive weapons include sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, Jackson and Steven Mitchell Jr.
“It’s a special thing when you look up and it’s JuJu, Adoree and Steven on the field at once,” offensive coordinator Clay Helton said. “That’s a lot of speed on the field at one time.”
Helton, however, is well aware of Washington’s defense and the challenge it will pose to his offense.
“They don’t blow assignments,” Helton said. “They make you go the long way. It’ll be a tough challenge for us.”
Kickoff is set for 6 p.m. in the Coliseum. The game will be broadcast live on ESPN.

Only about one in 10 people is actually a morning person, according to the Body Clock Guide to Mental Health. This is a statistic that may still seem too high for the nine other people that hit the snooze button religiously.Many factors, such as a dreaded class, late night studying or an unfavorable commute can contribute to a person’s unwillingness to leave the sanctuary of his or her bed. However, it is possible to trick yourself into thinking you are a morning person — or at least have a more pleasant morning — with a couple of quick tips:
1. Know your sleep cycle
Your sleep cycle can be broken down to three stages: falling asleep, light sleep and deep sleep. In the first stage, your eyes may be closed, but it should be easy to wake you up because you have not yet actually fallen asleep. The second phase is light sleep in which your heart rate slows and your body temperature cools down in preparation for Rapid Eye Movement sleep (REM). The last phase, deep sleep, is composed of REM. At this point it is difficult to wake a person up; it’s typically when you have dreams and when your body gets the most rest. Waking up during deep sleep will often leave you disoriented and more tired than if you woke up in light sleep. Since your body goes through multiple sleep cycles throughout the night, knowing when you will be in light sleep can allow you to wake up when your body is most prepared for it, leaving you feeling more energized and ready to take on the day. You can calculate when you should wake up or go to sleep on sites such as http://sleepyti.me/ and apps such as the Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock.
2. Give yourself ample time to wake up and get ready
Though an extra 15 minutes of sleep may seem appealing when you’re setting your alarm, you could easily put that time toward breakfast or a another morning activity. Giving yourself enough time to get ready in the morning without being in a rush will reduce the stress and chaos associated with mornings. This might even allow you to reward yourself with the incentive of enjoying a cup of coffee or a breakfast burrito while browsing social media or reading the news. For example, waking up just 20 minutes earlier allows me to take my time getting washed up and dressed before heading to Smiles Café for a cup of iced coffee while I catch up on emails.
3. Make breakfast your best friend
It’s true that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it’s also important to make sure you eat the right type of breakfast. Often times, too big or too heavy of a breakfast will leave you in a wanting to crawl back into your bed from a “food-coma.” Pair proteins such as yogurt and eggs with carbs like oatmeal or a bagel to keep you full, focused and energized for the rest of the day. Additionally, natural sugars from fresh fruit can be a refreshing start to any day. Having some of your favorite foods for breakfast can also serve as an incentive to waking up. After all, the only thing better than sleep is food.

Each year, Nicole and her sister go through their “Jar of Good Things” to celebrate the positive things that happened to them. Brittany Fleck | Daily Trojan
College life can be difficult. Being 20-something in today’s society, and being immersed in our super competitive life at USC, leaves a lot of room for stress. The pressure that many of us feel to constantly succeed can sometimes get the best of us.
However, thinking about how we deal with stress may alleviate negative feelings in our lives. For example, I am a visual thinker. This means that I imagine most things I think about  as something physical. When I think about the word “stress,” I imagine a million Brittanys running around like a crazy lunatic. I imagine the word “god” as a large gust of wind with an old man’s face and long beard inside of it. I visualize words as colors and like to pair a certain image with my emotions.
Call it a special characteristic or gift, but I have found that clear visualization in my life leads me to greater success. I would like to share a few of my tactics for visualizing, and how it helps me let go of life’s anxieties.
I am often described as high energy and high functioning by the people I hold close. This has a positive impact on me, but at times it causes heightened emotions — most commonly — heightened anxiety.
When I am anxious, I visualize my list of worries as a physical “slate.” I see a shiny, flat surface, filled with my worries of the week or month. I find that when I take this “slate” and physically write all of my worries down on a piece of paper, it makes them seem so much less consequential. I feel my mind becoming clearer as I write down my stresses. After I visualize my “mental slate,” I feel clear and more relaxed.
I try to participate in this type of meditation at least once a week. Each Sunday I open to a blank piece of a journal and title the page “Worries.” From there, I write down anything that comes to mind. If you decide to try this method of distressing, don’t filter or judge yourself for feeling anxious about particular things. Let everything out on the page. Let it exit your mind through your hands as your write. Your worries can be anything from writing a 10-page research paper to trying to get rid of the enormous bags that have camped out under your eyes this week.
Now, look at your list of worries. Seeing your stressors physically written out leaves room for mental clarification. According to Psychology Today, thoughts produce the same mental instructions as actions. Imagining, visualizing and utilizing mental imagery impacts many cognitive processes in the brain: motor control, attention, perception, planning and memory. This means that visualization trains the brain for actual performance and mental relaxation . Visualizing the things that cause stress in your life, make it easier to cope.Grab a piece of paper. Do it with an “umph” as you move away from your worries.
 After, write on the next page “Happiness.” This is my favorite part. Amongst the stressors, anxieties, worries and craziness that I feel in life, there is still so much good in the world, and so much to be happy about. Write down some of the things that make you happy and visualize them. They look pretty good don’t they? These things can be as small as hearing your favorite song on the radio, or sharing a memory with a friend; they can be things that made you happy last week, or things you have to look forward to in the future.
According to Greatist, an online health publication, research shows that actually physically tossing your worries away can lessen their hold on you. Similarly, if you document your positive experiences you are more likely to feel happier in life.
My little sister and I have a tradition where we write down good things that happen to us, write them down, fold it them, and put it in a mason jar. What we call our “Jar of Good Things”  contains notes about anything that makes us happy, anything we are grateful for — big or small. On Jan. 1 of each year, we get to reopen our notes and read each other’s “good things” aloud. I love recounting the good times from my year. It’s especially great because there are so many things you forget as time goes on, but when you read a note out loud, it takes you right back to that place and time, and the feelings you felt. This jar allows us to go through the year,reliving the good times as if we were never apart.
I encourage you all to write down your good things and collect them into a jar that you can look back on. Share your happy memories with someone you love. This, along with the exercise of jotting down your worries, will aid gratefully in the development of your mental clean slate.
