When Candy Yee sits in the stands at a USC sporting event, she is doing more than just watching students play a game; she is cheering on the students that she has come to consider her children.
“We’ll sit in the stands and we’ll see them playing like it’s my son or daughter out there,” Yee said. “It makes you proud of them. It makes you proud to be a Trojan.”
Sweet stuff · Alumna Candy Yee works at the sports information desk in Heritage Hall on Thursdays and Fridays. She writes a blog about USC news and sport events. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Yee and her husband, Jim, are regular fixtures at most home sporting events, but many students know them as the smiling faces, always ready with a cheerful greeting and some candy at the Heritage Hall information desk on Thursdays and Fridays.
They began volunteering at the information desk about six years ago, but Yee had already been a member of the Trojan Family for nearly 50 years. In 1964, she moved from Houston to Los Angeles to begin her undergraduate degree in elementary education at USC.
“It’s football that brought me in,” Yee said of her decision to attend USC over Columbia University, UC Berkeley and UCLA.
It was more than just football that made her stay. As a student, Yee was involved in a variety of student organizations, including the election committee, the Amazons (now the Helenes) and the Delta Phi sorority.
After graduating, she kept coming back, attending athletic events with her husband. She became a member of Town and Gown and the Trojan Guild. All three of her children were accepted to USC, and one of her daughters attended.
“My daughter was also in Helenes,” Yee said. “It was kind of an honor to have her in it.”
After retiring from 37 years as a teacher in Los Angeles, Yee heard about an opening for volunteers at the Heritage Hall information desk from a friend and she and her husband decided to volunteer.
“I missed being with children,” she said. “A lot of the athletes that come in are like [my] kids.”
Their official job is to help direct visitors and provide more information about USC, but when other volunteers suggested they give out candy, Trojan Candy was created.
“We put some [candy] up, and then we started doing more and more different things,” Yee said. “Certain kids came, and they liked certain things so we’d make sure we had it next time, and it’s just kind of grown.”
Now, students who stop by the information desk when the Yees are volunteering are treated to a variety of snacks, from a bag of chips to a candy bar. Most of their regular visitors are athletes, but many students and staff members also stop by for a hello and a snack.
“[I love] meeting anybody that goes through Heritage Hall,” Yee said. “I love to meet the people and talk to them. I’ve been known to run out after people because I recognize their faces.”
Yee said she knows about three-quarters of the football team, as well as many volleyball, basketball and track athletes. Redshirt sophomore De’Von Flournoy is one of many football players who began visiting Yee his freshman year.
“On Wednesdays, I look forward to Thursdays knowing that before my 2:15 meeting, snacks will be here,” Flournoy said. “It’s one of the many traditions here.”
Though free snacks might be the initial draw, Yee’s personality is the reason many students come back.
“She’s very approachable,” Flournoy said. “It’s not like she just sits here and says hi. She actually asks about how you’re doing and offers an endless supply of goodies.”
Yee and her husband pay for the snacks themselves, so they ask visitors for one simple favor — an interview and a photo for Yee’s blog, TrojanCandy.com.
“All over the years, when I came to ’SC, I had thought about being a journalist,” Yee said. “I had really wanted to be one of the reporters that interviews the athletes, but in 1964 women didn’t interview athletes.”
Yee now has the opportunity to fulfill her dream of interviewing athletes through her blog, which she and her husband began in 2008. The inspiration, however, was not originally to interview students, but to provide alternate sports coverage.
“I call [the Los Angeles Times] the UCLA Times,” she said. “They always say nice stuff about UCLA, but put down USC. It’s not fair.”
Yee uses her blog, Trojan Justice: The (UC)LA Times Watchdog, to critique the Los Angeles Times coverage, where she also reports on sporting events and interviews with Heritage Hall visitors.
Great article about a wonderful person and what it means to be a true Trojan! I miss seeing you at the volleyball games but hope to be back for some tennis matchs.
I wish I had aTrojan Candy when I was in college. Keep up the great work. You are a true fan!
I am proud of my sister-in-law for her years of dedication to education. The example Jim and she set should be the model we strive for our own children. It is in our family!
By the way Bruins think of that dishwasher as the SC Times so they get it from both sides.
I frequently visit Heritage Hall and every time I see Candy there, she greets me with a smile, her fun and motherly personality and snacks on snacks on snacks. Great article! Fight On!
Excellent article! Everything the article says about Candy Yee characterizes her precisely. I know the Yee family well having gone to USC for my graduate studies with Jim Yee candy’s husband. I am proud to know Candy and Jim as my friends.
Fight on Trojan Candy! It’s so nice to hear about the difference you’re making in these students’ lives.

With the application for the July California Bar Exam now available, USC law students are making preparations for the final test.
USC Gould School of Law ranks sixth in the nation in bar exam preparation, according to the National Jurist, which analyzed the ration between the LSAT scores of incoming students and the performances on their bar exams.
For the fourth year in a row, USC also has the highest bar passage rate in California with a passage rate of 91 percent.
Robert Rasmussen, dean of the Gould School of Law, said the success of USC students can be attributed to the school’s selective admissions process.
“We look at the whole package of the person, not just the LSAT score,” Rasmussen said, “We select students who have the potential to be outstanding lawyers and pass the bar.”
Rasmussen said Gould aims to have its students pass the bar exam, but also prepare them for a long-term career in law.
“We have the best legal writing program in the country,” said Rasmussen, “Our faculty teaches students to think like lawyers. We want students to leave here with a platform to pass the bar and have a 50-year-plus career.”
Maya Sukumar, a third-year law student, said the practical-based education at Gould makes her confident she can pass the bar exam and succeed as a lawyer.
“We get real world experience here and the professors do a really good job of tailoring our education to what we can expect to see as practicing lawyers,” Sukumar said.
To help students with the bar exam, Gould has created extensive academic support programs for students who need additional instruction, said Gould Dean of Students Priya Sridharan.
“We have created programs to ensure all students develop their legal analytic skills and their writing skills,” Sridharan said.
Approximately 200 students matriculate per incoming class, and the small size of Gould allows students to collaborate with faculty and their fellow classmates, Rasmussen said.
Michael Parente, a third-year law student, said fellow classmates serve as an important source of motivation while preparing for the California Bar Exam.
“[Gould] is a smaller school and we are a really tight-knit community,” Parente said. “We’re competitive by nature. I guess it’s the Trojan spirit.”
Andrew Quinio, a third-year law student, said he feels well prepared for the bar exam, which he’s scheduled to take in July, because of the curriculum and the faculty support he has received at Gould.
“The law program at USC develops drive and discipline through courses and professors who consistently inspire us,” Quino said. “The faculty definitely gives us a lot of support — academically and even emotionally.”
A crucial component of Gould is the community that develops between students, alumni and faculty, Rasmussen said.
“A premium is placed on those who have a good network in the legal community,” Rasmussen said, “We really want lifelong relationships with our students. It’s part of being in the Trojan Family.”
Just an FYI California family code recognizes the marriage of first cousins as a valid marriage.

Ambassadors to the United States representing more than 40 countries came to campus Friday to learn about innovation as part of a three-day tour of Los Angeles sponsored by the U.S. Department of State.
The senior diplomats heard about such topics as branding, changes in social media and the availability of capital in Los Angeles over breakfast in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom. The stop at USC was one of three that day.
Kamyl Bazbaz, a public affairs officer for the U.S. Department of State, said the program breeds collaboration.
“The goal is really to get these incredible senior diplomats outside of Washington, have them experience the rest of our country, plant the seeds for new partnerships or relationships and have this be the beginning of something really great,” Bazbaz said.

Some ambassadors said the discussion brought them to think about how their country pursues innovative ideas.
“The panel was important for us to think of ways to work with innovation and pass innovation to other countries. We need to create partnerships with universities so our country can look for the most advanced technology,” said Ambassador Peter Burian of the Slovak Republic. “We have something and USC has something to offer, so we need to work together to create a partnership.”
Ambassador Roman Kirn of Slovenia said the panel discussion gave him a broader meaning of innovation.
“I hadn’t heard such strong messages about social innovation and now it is something I have to think about more,” Kirn said. “We are always thinking about technical innovation, but it [is not everything].”
Speakers also stressed the role of universities in the process of innovation. Karen Kerr, senior director of New Ventures and Alliances at the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, said USC understands that universities are a catalyst for innovation.
“USC has made a tremendous commitment to help advance technologies to the point where they really can be spun out of the university,” Kerr said. “And, it really takes a village. It’s not just the university, but it also has to involve the government and private partnership to be able to stimulate these innovations.”
Several ambassadors said it takes coordination to bring innovation from universities out to the wider population.
“It is obvious that USC has a lot to offer the world,” said Ambassador Evan J. Paki of Papua New Guinea. “It is important that we are always finding innovative ways to solve problems and that we are not only cooperating with other governments but with institutions within countries.”
When introducing the panel, USC President C. L. Max Nikias said universities should continually build on the past to innovate for the future through collaboration.
“Research universities like USC understand the problems of today are so complex they cannot be resolved with single answers or solutions from the past,” Nikias said. “We need to harness the power of every culture, every generation and every great mind.”
Several of the ambassadors said they were impressed by the university, including Ambassador Pavlos Anastasiades of Cyprus.
“I’ve never been here before, but I was impressed with what I saw,” Anastasiades said.
Ambassador Temur Yakobashvili of Georgia said the visit made a strong impression.
“I am disappointed I did not go to USC,” Yakobashvili said. “I wish I had gone here, and now I want my son to go here, because this university is the very best.”
This was the first time a trip has focused on Los Angeles since the Experience America program began in 2007. This is the ninth tour overall and the fifth during the Obama administration.
Anthony Bailey, associate provost for global initiatives, said the breakfast was a unique opportunity.
“We don’t often engage with ambassadors from smaller countries and this was a great way to do so — especially with African countries,” Bailey said.
The program exemplifies Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s goal of using different ways to communicate diplomacy, Bazbaz said.
“This is what Secretary Clinton talks about with smart power — you need to use all your tools for diplomacy, not just traditional tools,” Bazbaz said. “Trips like this — public diplomacy programs — really make a difference. USC did a great job representing the United States.”

Where can you find a virtual replica of an arctic area, an antique theater and a getaway garden?
Past the vast stretch of dining options on Figueroa Street near campus resides this hidden gem, which is worth exploring because of its ability to take visitors completely out of their element.
Secret garden · The Velaslavasay Panorama and Union Theatre features a hidden garden, a relaxing retreat full of exotic natural life. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Within the walls of the Velaslavasay Panorama Garden and Grounds, you’ll be removed from the concrete madness of Los Angeles and find yourself ensconced in a mysterious little world of its own.
With only a large sign that says “UNION” and a smaller one welcoming you inside, the building on 24th Street doesn’t seem too enticing.
The casual passerby might figure it’s just an old theater or perhaps another museum ridden with dusty bookshelves and boring glass displays.
And though the locale steeps itself in its 18th- and 19th-century history, its many surprises can supply any modern-day visitor with plenty of diversion.
Entrance is free unless you want to make a donation. If you are adventurous enough, you’ll forgo any introduction and step right in. As you walk in you’ll come across a small, dimly lit stairway. Once you get closer, you’ll see a small boat in a glass case. Now you can’t help but walk up the steps and what happens next proves to be fascinating and historically interesting.
The upstairs room reveals a 360-degree panorama of an arctic landscape. “Effulgence of the North” sets you right in an arctic setting complete with dim lights and arctic-like sounds drifting throughout. The detailed panorama uses the right colors and shading to make you feel as though you’re not inside a small room in Los Angeles but somewhere in a vast, cold landscape.
Only a few of these works still exist and they recall a time when people couldn’t indulge in the technology of movies as they can today; instead, they relied on the panoramas, first patented as far back as 1787, to virtually transport them to another place or time.
But even today’s CGI-audience can appreciate the artistic finesse of the works and the utter surprise of finding such a gem amid the ever-busy city. A sitting area in front of the panorama lets you take in every detail and use the spot as a get-away from the outside city if you so wish.
The city didn’t always have this gem. As events coordinator Bettina Escauriza said, the locale boasts a complex history.
“Originally we had a panorama off Hollywood and that building was called the Tswuun-Tswuun Rotunda and it was a Chinese building that was originally a restaurant and eventually, it became the home of the Velaslavasay panorama that became The Panorama of the Valley of the Smokes,” Escauriza said. “That building was torn down, so we moved here and the Union Theatre was vacant.”
But the panorama is not the only attraction the location offers.
Once you walk downstairs and explore the rest of the locale, the surprises keep coming. The locale was, after all, at one point, a theater. A few seats from that era are still present, along with a stage and a few antique, retro instruments.
Despite feeling anachronistic, the theater still hosts a plethora of events of presentations and performances.
The building had many other uses, from an acting school run by famous femme fatale actress Louise Glaum to screenings for a USC after-hours film series in the 1970s. Each occupation brought changes to the locale but today, some of the original features still remain.
“There were originally 400 seats but now there are only 17, [which are] the only ones [boltered] to the ground,” Escauriza said.
And even if you don’t know all of this history or don’t care for it, the gardens outside offer a retreat that is all its own.
Venture outside and you’ll stumble upon an impressive amount of natural life, with plants originating everywhere from Australia to Africa. There are plenty of places to sit, and melted candlewax and discarded cigarette butts give the place an aura of mystery.
As if that’s not enough, the locale includes an Ancillary Salon that features changing art exhibitions. Events throughout the week keep the locale abuzz and merge the history of the place with events in the arts world today.
The best part of the locale is that it lends itself to be whatever a visitor might want: an alternative study space or a spot for just spicing up any given afternoon. The sign on the outside of the theater might not indicate very much about the surprises inside but in the end, that’s the best part of it all.

“There’s no agony like bearing an untold story inside you.”
Though actress Vanessa Bell Calloway delivered the line, playwright Gabrielle Pina certainly understood the need to convey touching tales with her play Letters from Zora, which was performed Saturday in Bovard Auditorium and tells the story of one of America’s most talented and underrated writers: Zora Neale Hurston, most famous for her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.
A woman, an artist · Actress Vanessa Bell Calloway stunned audiences with her emotive portrayal of Zora Neale Hurston’s attitude and charisma. By switching from the joyful to the mournful, from the triumphant to the tragic, Calloway narrated the turmoiled life of a black writer in the 20th century. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The one-woman show played to a packed house, drawing audience members of all ages who were keen to get a peek into the private life of one of the greatest black authors in history. But even for those who were unfamiliar with Hurston’s work, there were several reasons to attend the performance.
For starters, Calloway’s presence generated some buzz. The actress has been nominated for eight National Association for the Advancement of Colored People image awards, and is famous for lead roles in Coming to America with Eddie Murphy and What’s Love Got to Do with It with Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne.
Then there was the opportunity to witness the work of USC Professional Writing faculty member Pina. Winner of the 2002 Pacificus Literary Prize for achievement in short fiction, Pina is renown in the literary world and has published two successful novels: Bliss and Chasing Sophea.
The combination of literary and artistic talents had the potential to make the Visions and Voices: The USC Arts & Humanities Initiative event a smash and left audience members in eager anticipation.
They weren’t disappointed.
The production ran a little more than an hour and encompassed Hurston’s broad life story, ranging from her early days in the Harlem Renaissance to her travels in Haiti and Honduras to her death in Fort Pierce, Fla. Calloway, as Hurston, narrated encounters with Langston Hughes, Dorothy West and other members of the Black Arts Movement as she glided across a stage set only with carpet and a few pieces of furniture while a small jazz ensemble played in the background.
And because Pina’s play pulled material from genuine Hurston letters, the production brought a haunting authenticity to its historical narrative and informed even as it entertained.
Though one-woman shows can easily bore an audience with verbosity and minimal spectacle, Calloway’s performance was anything but dull. The actress’ warm, dark voice filled the auditorium and made audience members feel as if they were truly part of an intimate conversation; the presence of another actor would have felt intrusive.
In addition, Calloway’s diverse talent dominated the stage. She was able to switch from a young, provocative girl to a withering old woman in mere seconds, demonstrating her technical abilities and ability to connect with the character.
Calloway’s performance was accented by assistant professor of theatre Tom Ontiveros’ projection design. As Calloway regaled the audience with Hurston’s biography, Ontiveros projected fleeting images of letters, photographs and historical figures onto a suspended screen. The added visual context brought realism to the performance’s more abstract choreography and was helpful without being distracting.
Yet with all the gaiety and vivid display the performance offers, Letters from Zora’s darker elements bring a level of sobriety to the production. Pina’s play doesn’t shy away from Zora’s challenges with racism or the false accusations of child molestation against her. Instead, the show highlights the good times and the bad, depicting the fluctuating turmoil of human life.
Audience members got riled when Calloway described Hurston receiving only a $200 advance for a novel, compared to the usual $5,000 advance for white authors from the time period; Ralph Ellison’s dismissal of Hurston’s work as unsuited for black progression also elicited surprise and disdain.
Pina’s script displays blatantly cruel facts even as it flaunts jokes, adding details to a previously muddled history and also creating a sense of present-day purpose.
“The black writers should have the same rights as the white writers,” said Calloway as Hurston in a particularly defiant moment. “Which is to write whatever the hell we please.”
Underneath all of this was a jazz quartet directed by music professor Ron McCurdy. The group enhanced Calloway’s performance with lulling piano and vibrant bass, perfectly setting moods of sorrow and joy. And even with the soundtrack-like quality of the performance lingering in the background, Letters from Zora never calls attention to itself more than necessary, making it very easy for audience members to forget the technical and remain immersed in the story.
The nearly flawless performance made it impossible to not be touched by the direct and authentic interaction with history. When the curtains parted and Calloway, Pina and director/assistant professor of theatre practice Anita Dashiell-Sparks stood onstage together, it was hard to ignore the feeling that there should have been an extra place where Hurston herself could stand.
The play was breathtaking!!! I learned so much about Zora and was blown away by how well Vanessa Bell Calloway performed and how well Gabrielle Pina wrote the play. This is definately amazing talent. I hope that this play spreads across the nation. I see Gabrielle Pina’s work as surpassing Tyler Perry. She is truly gifted. Can’t wait to see the next performance. Great Work!!!!
i love how this article opened with the line i struck me the most! this play was so great and completely reignited my love in reading and reading zora….
Absolutely spellbinding performance. Vanessa Bell Calloway was magnificent and the story was moving. Would love to see it again…such reach dialogue and complex story. This bares seeing again.
Although I am only a German citizen living here I am ‘totally’ amazed at Zora N.H.’s genius!  I learned the
last lines of “Their eyes were watching god” by heart and carry them with me wherever…  (Being able to
say “wearing the sun like a shawl”… is possibly her most beautiful line…)  Am so happy having dis-
covered her and, when next in Florida would like to visit her grave site….with some sunflowers…to pay
my tribute to such a wonderful spirit….   Dirk Holger  (of Munich, Germany)

The allure of the food truck or the taco stand is that it’s simple. There are no reservations needed. The service is quick. It’s cheap. It holds the convenience of fast food without the corporate stamp and the mass production.
And that’s what makes Mexicali Taco & Co.’s move from a late-night taco stand to a full-fledged, brick-and-mortar restaurant on Figueroa Street all the more interesting.
¡Viva Mexico! · Mexicali Taco & Co. features simplistic ethnic eats such as the zuperman (left) which includes chorizo, carne asada and chicken with cheese and of course traditional tacos of all sorts of meat. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The popular taco joint had previously been stationed amid a parking lot on First Street and Beaudry Avenue, just a couple blocks west of its current location. There was one grill, a couple tables and a canopy to shield patrons from the occasional late-night L.A. rain.
It was well-liked, sure, but it was also limited: only open four days a week from Wednesday through Saturday from 8 p.m. to midnight, largely catering to a handful of commuters coming to and from work just north of Downtown.
Mexicali, which is owned by Javier Fregoso, Esdras Ochoa and Paul Yoo, opened at its new spot mid-February, and is now open six days a week for lunch and dinner.
“It was our dream,” Ochoa said about the decision to transform his taco stand into a full-blown restaurant.
But the move also caused some to wonder whether it could capture its old outdoor charm and simplistic feel.
Rest assured, the new place doesn’t miss much.
At its core, it still feels like an ordinary food stand. Within the confines, there are five bright red picnic tables. The walls are modestly adorned with a handful of photographs — a few shots of Downtown Los Angeles and a map of Baja California. The space’s wood accents give it a sort of temporary, makeshift feel. You order and pick up food at the counter. Maybe most importantly, Mexicali’s menu features items that range from $2.25 to $5.75.
There is something simple, but not ordinary, about Mexicali tacos — winners of L.A. Taco’s third annual Taco Madness last April — that proves comforting, making you want to come back for more.
The Mexicali taco, which comes with the choice of carne asada, pollo or chorizo, is not cluttered with excess cheese, sauces or onions. It’s tender, but it doesn’t crumble into pieces after each bite.
There is something to be said for food that isn’t draped in myriad  sauces and cheeses. Sometimes, simplicity can suffice. It’s evident here and in its other favorites like the Vampiro, a crispy quesadilla infused with cheese, meat and garlic sauce, as well as with the Cachetada — a tostada that combines chorizo, Mexican cheese and a house-made, savory chipotle sauce.
Neither will run up your tab more than $4.
But where Mexicali’s traditional options excel, its new offerings miss the mark slightly.
There have been some recent additions following the relocation. Mexicali now boasts a vegetarian option as a substitute for one of its three meats. It has also added nachos, dripping in cheese, avocado salsa and pico de gallo.
But it’s a bit too much.
What makes Mexicali stand out, almost oxymoronically, is its simplicity. Its tacos and tostada-like Cachetadas offer just enough to keep you more than satisfied with each savoring bite, but not too much where it becomes overwhelming.
Conversely, its nachos, wrapped in a variety of cheeses among other side items, carry a processed feel — it’s the kind of cluttered dish you could find just about anywhere in Southern California. And while Mexicali’s Zuperman — with a combination of  carne asada, chicken and chorizo, topped with a mixture of cheeses — has been around for years, it too feels a bit over the top. And at $5, you’d probably be better off just ordering an extra taco.
But combine that taco or two with an horchata — one of Mexicali’s three available aguas frescas — that’s perfectly refreshing and subtly sweet, and it becomes quite the stop.
With each bite, it’s as if you’re in your own little neighborhood.
And even with the move away from its old parking lot, you can still taste Mexicali Taco & Co.’s late-night charm.

USC women’s basketball will enter the Pac-12 tournament with momentum after ending regular season play on Saturday with a season-high six-game win streak.
The Women of Troy (18-11, 12-6) ended the regular season with a 65-54 win over Washington State (11-19, 5-13) in the final matchup of a two-game road trip.
Shooter’s touch · Senior guard Ashley Corral scored 25 points and had 10 rebounds in a road win against Washington State. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Senior guard Ashley Corral and junior forward Christina Marinacci helped pace a 13-0 run for the Women of Troy in the second half that gave USC a 11-point lead over the Cougars.
Washington State managed to whittle the deficit to six with 3:33 remaining, but stingy defense from USC allowed just one more point from the Cougars for the rest of the game.
“We’re very good at team defense, and that’s something that the whole team prides itself in,” Corral said.
Corral notched her third career double-double with a game-high 25 points and 10 rebounds. Marinacci had 18 points and six rebounds, and sophomore forward Cassie Harberts chipped in 11 points.
Though USC never trailed in the contest, it could not extend its lead past single digits until its 13-0 run with less than 15 minutes to go.
“[USC coach Michael Cooper] basically made sure we had our focus and told us that it was winning time,” Marinacci said. “We needed to go in and forget that we were tired. We kept pushing and luckily just made a run.”
The Women of Troy shot 35.1 percent and forced 18 turnovers from the Cougars, who had just snapped a seven-game skid with a win over UCLA on Thursday.
USC carries its six-game win streak to the Pac-12 tournament with high hopes.
“[Senior guard Briana Gilbreath] and I were saying that since we’ve been here, we’ve never ended on a win streak, so this is huge for us,” Corral said.
As one of the top four teams in the conference, the Women of Troy will have a first round bye in the Pac-12 tournament and will begin play on Thursday at 7:15 p.m. at the Galen Center against the winner of the UCLA and Arizona game.
USC had already clinched the third seed in the Pac-12 tournament before the matchup against Washington State, but the Women of Troy continued to battle for a win in their attempt to earn an NCAA tournament berth.
“We’re shooting for that magical 20 number, and this was just one more team that was in our way,” Corral said. “We needed to get [the win] for our future, and that was our focus.”
In the Pac-12 tournament, the Women of Troy hope to notch two wins to not only advance to the conference title game, but to hit 20 victories, which significantly ups their chances at earning a spot among the 64 teams in the NCAA tournament.
“If we come out of the Pac-12 tournament with at least 20 wins, there’s no way the NCAA committee will not put us in,” Marinacci said. “That’s our mindset going into these next two games.”

Sophomore Vladimir Morozov won the conference title in the 100-yard freestyle to lead USC on the final day of the Pac-12 championships at the East Los Angeles Swim Center in Monterey Park, Calif.
Morozov, who also won the 50-yard freestyle on Thursday, is the first swimmer in USC history since Joe Bottom in 1977 to sweep the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle at the conference championships.
USC finished the conference meet in fourth place with 517 points. Stanford won its 31st-consecutive team conference title, finishing with 939.5 points, followed by California in second with 808 points and Arizona in third with 543 points. Following USC in the standings was Utah (258.5), UC Santa Barbara (251.5), Arizona State (221.5) and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (120).
The Trojans had three swimmers place in the 100-yard freestyle final after getting four in the 200-yard freestyle on Friday. Morozov finished preliminaries in 42.06 and finished finals in 41.86, beating his school record by .02 and setting the nation’s best time in the event.
Sophomore Dimitri Colupaev took fifth place after finishing 11th last year. Colupaev holds USC’s second-fastest time in the 100-yard freestyle and won the 200-yard freestyle on Friday. Senior Jeff Daniels earned his second career conference finals appearance and first in the event with a personal record 43.56 in prelims and tied for USC’s eighth-fastest time in the event.
Morozov, Colupaev, Daniels and Quintero finished .25 behind Cal in the 400-yard freestyles relay, almost winning USC’s first title in the event since 1979. Morozov started off the event with a 42.03, followed by Colupaev, who got USC off to a lead of 1.99 seconds over Cal, and Daniels, who had USC ahead by more than a second entering the final fourth. But Cal’s Tom Shields caught up to Quintero, helping Cal take first in 2:51.45, the fastest time in the nation.
Quintero took second in the 1,650-yard freestyle in 14:55.58, beating out Cal’s Adam Hinshaw, almost earning an NCAA “A” cut.
Hinshaw took the lead after Quintero led him for the first part of the race. He maintained that lead until the final 50 yards, when Quintero led Hinshaw by .85 seconds to finish ahead of him by .10 seconds.
Senior Julian Bonse and sophomore Nick Johnson finished eighth and ninth in the event with personal records of 15:18.47 and 15:19.11, respectively,
Junior Alex Lendrum finished fourth in the 200-yard backstroke, a career conference-best finish (1:42.42) and his third straight conference final in the event. Sophomore Chase Bloch set a personal record with a 1:44.00 and a 10th-place finish, while freshman Chad Bobrosky and junior Nick Karpov took 17th and 20th respectively.
Freshman Sergio Lujan Rivera made his second straight appearance in a breaststroke final with a season-best prelim time of 2:00.16. Rivera finished eighth in the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:02.91, a day after finishing eighth in the 100-yard breaststroke. Freshman Andrew Malone and senior Will Orlady took 10th and 14th, respectively (1:46.55 and 1:47.70).
Junior Justin DiFederico made the 200-yard fly final for the second straight year, barely missing his personal record in the prelims with a time of 1:45.63. DiFederico took seventh in the final in 1:47.06, with freshman Cary Wright finishing in 15th (1:49.42), and junior Matt Voell finishing in 22nd (1:52.47).

In their second home match of the season on Saturday afternoon, the No. 3 Women of Troy (11-3, 1-1) fell 6-5 to No. 1 UCLA (13-1, 2-0) after leading 5-4 after three periods. USC led 2-0 after the first period and 4-2 at halftime.
But two consecutive turnovers in just over a minute led to two Bruin goals in the fourth quarter, changing the score from a 5-4 USC lead to a 6-5 deficit.
Blown chances · USC held a two-goal lead in the fourth quarter. UCLA, however, scored twice to seal the game in the closing minutes. - Adrian Hoffman | Daily Trojan
The Bruins didn’t lead until attacker Gisselle Naranjo lobbed a shot into the top left corner of the goal with just under three minutes left to complete the comeback for UCLA.
Sophomore driver Monica Vavic stole the ball with just under a minute left to give the Women of Troy one last chance, and a UCLA foul gave them a power play on their final possession.
But a final shot from junior two-meter Patricia Jancso went wide left, which allowed the Bruins to run out the clock.
“We lost our focus and they didn’t,” said sophomore goalie Flora Bolonyai, who had 10 saves in the losing effort. “We have to close out games.”
Vavic and sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist led USC with two goals, and senior driver Nadia Dan chipped in one.
“We just let too many counterattacks, and little things like that keep getting in our way, and it ended up hurting us in the end,” Gilchrist said. “We needed to get a couple more goals and shut them down, but we couldn’t finish them off.”
But the team remains optimistic about the rest of the season.
“It’s a long season, and it’s still early,” Gilchrist said. “We can take this [loss] and turn it around and hopefully end up on top in the end.”
Saturday’s loss was the second time USC lost against UCLA in as many matches.
At the UC Irvine Invitational last Sunday, the Women of Troy took a 7-5 lead into the fourth period against the Bruins before falling 8-7.
“That was our game to win, and it was all on us that we lost,” Gilchrist said.
USC’s next action comes this week in another home match on Friday against San Diego State at 5 p.m. at McDonald Swim Stadium.

Derek Mac Arthur didn’t miss a USC men’s basketball game at the Galen Center all season. No matter how ugly it got. No matter how unwatchable the Trojans appeared at times.
Through thick and thin · Derek Mac Arthur (better known as “Disco Derek”) has not missed a USC home basketball game since February 2009. He often travels 90 minutes to attend games at the Galen Center. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
And believe me, on Saturday, they were again borderline unwatchable — it’s worth noting they scored 14 first-half points in a 43-38 loss to Washington State.
Fourteen-year-old Derek, perhaps more commonly known to USC fans as “Disco Derek” for his popular dance, hasn’t missed a game since Feb. 21, 2009 — for a friend’s birthday party. His current streak spans 51 games over three years.
Since the Galen Center opened in 2006, he’s attended nearly every game — missing just two, often making what can be a 90-minute trek from Riverside to USC.
“It’s just always fun to come out and watch a basketball game,” says Derek, who routinely sports a Trojan Fever T-shirt, a baseball cap and a pair of      gold-trimmed sunglasses.
Most fans, however, didn’t exactly find the 2012 season all that fun. USC averaged 3,970 fans per game — the lowest in the arena’s six-year history.
And over 17 home games, Derek only saw the Trojans win a handful of times — four to be exact.
“This was a rebuilding year,” he says. “I always have to think next year will be better — just shake it off.”
Call it optimism. Call it loyalty. Or perhaps, call it routine fanaticism.
Derek’s father, Chris, graduated from USC in 1981. His grandfather, M. Hebbard, graduated in 1940. And his family has had season tickets for men’s basketball for the last six seasons.
Oh, don’t fret; They go to football games, too.
But Derek has made his mark on the court, so to speak, celebrated and cheered for a second-half disco dance that dates, by his estimations, to 2006.
The dance originated during a Domino’s Pizza giveaway, he says. The popular chain was passing out pizzas to excited fans at games, and Derek, along with his older brother, often got up and danced in the hope of receiving a slice.
But Derek — more than 100 games later -— hasn’t stopped.
He danced during the Tim Floyd years. He danced throughout the Trojans’ 19-win season last winter. He danced this year, too, in spite of the Trojans’ worst regular season in team history with 25 losses.
The losing didn’t exactly faze him.
“It would be easy not to support us,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said following Saturday’s game. “It’d be easy not to even watch us.”
That’s probably an understatement.
Though the third-year coach’s comments were primarily directed toward the fanbase at large, he’s taken notice of Mac Arthur before.
Last year, O’Neill and the rest of his players presented Derek with a signed basketball in the moments before the team’s final home game against Arizona State.
“I was sitting here [in my seat], eating popcorn and looking at my phone,” Derek recalls. “My mom tapped me on the shoulder, I looked up and it was me on the video board.”
He walked down a few rows onto the court to meet the team.
The ball, which reads “Fight On,” commemorates him as the Trojans’ fan of the year for the 2010-2011 season — they didn’t give out such an award for     2011-2012.
“I just thought it’d be for a big donor or something,” he says.
All along, he’s been a fixture at home games, his face and his dance often played on the video board during various points of the games with public address announcer Petros Papadakis introducing him to everyone in the vicinity.
Occasionally, he’ll flash a thumbs-up toward the student section, which gave him his nickname, or he’ll throw two fingers in the air to say “Fight On” to nearby fans and passersby.
Most frequently he discos — which is how most people have come to recognize the        eighth-grade diehard who sits in section 116, row eight, seat three.
It might not be total celebrity status, but it’s close enough for now.
“We used to leave games by walking in front of the student section,” Derek says. “One time, someone just asked, ‘Can I take a picture with you?’
“It was pretty cool.”

With one game remaining in the regular season, the USC men’s basketball team was looking to put an end to an eight-game losing streak and pick up some momentum going into the Pac-12 tournament. Instead, the Trojans (6-25, 1-17) fell Saturday night to Washington State (15-15, 7-11) in a closely contested game at the Galen Center by a score of 43-38.
No luck · Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson scored eight points against Washington State on Saturday. The Trojans lost their ninth straight game and finished the regular season 1-17 in Pac-12 play. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The Trojans had one of their lowest-scoring first halves of the season, putting up 14 points while shooting 5-for-23 (21.7 percent) from the floor.
Only three players — sophomore guard Maurice Jones, freshman guard Alexis Moore, and junior center James Blasczyk — scored in the first 20 minutes of action.
“We came out kind of flat,” sophomore forward Garrett Jackson said. “We had a chance to win it.”
USC made a furious comeback in the second half, holding the Cougars scoreless for more than nine minutes to cut the lead to three points with 31 seconds remaining.
Late free throws by Washington State and a missed 3-point attempt by junior guard Greg Allen iced the game for the Cougars.
“We did fight our tails off down the stretch and put ourselves in a position to win the game,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We missed some clutch free throws and some wide-open threes. We didn’t get it done.”
Washington State was led by forward Brock Motum, who scored 27 points, including his team’s first 13 points of the second half. No other player on the Cougars finished with more than six points.
“We made Brock Motum look like Larry Bird the second half in particular,” O’Neill said. “I don’t want to take anything away from him — there’s a guy who has become a very, very good player.”
The Trojans got 11 points from Jones, who was aided by Moore’s nine points (all from 3-pointers) and Jackson’s eight points and six rebounds.
Freshman forward Byron Wesley, who was averaging close to 20 points over his previous four games, finished with five on 1-for-7 shooting.
“They backed off him completely and took away his driving game,” O’Neill said. “What Byron is going to have to do if he wants to be a premier player, which he has a chance to be, is get in the gym every day for two hours and work on his shot.”
On Wednesday, the Trojans will take on UCLA (18-13, 11-7) in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament at the Staples Center. USC enters the tournament as the 12th seed.
UCLA, coming off a 75-69 victory over Washington, will serve as the fifth seed. The Bruins defeated USC in both their meetings this season. Tipoff is set for 2:30 p.m.
“I hope we do what we’ve been doing most of the year — and that’s playing as hard as we can and giving ourselves a chance to win,” O’Neill said.

The process of getting tested for a sexually transmitted infection isn’t sexy.
Though getting blood drawn and peeing into a cup in a doctor’s office is sterile, it doesn’t generate warm, fuzzy feelings. And sexually transmitted infections bring to mind painful sores and embarrassment.
But someone who regularly gets tested is responsible. That’s attractive.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Each STI has its own specific test, and the types of tests one person needs is specific to his or her own risk factors and sexual practices.
According to Mayo Clinic, the standard STI test panel should include chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, syphilis and hepatitis. Women should consider getting tested for human papillomavirus as well.
Female patients shouldn’t assume they are getting tested for STIs whenever they get a Pap smear, which generally tests for other abnormalities, such as mutations associated with cancer. Some doctors don’t run STI tests unless the patient asks for the tests.
After you’ve gotten tested, the next hurdle comes: discussing the results with your partner or partners.
Even if one’s test results are negative, broaching the subject of STI test results with a sexual partner is awkward at best; at worst, people make assumptions about someone’s sexual past just because he or she has gotten tested. Likewise, if you ask someone about his or her status, he or she might take offense that the question was even posed.
That’s the wrong way to go about the conversation. People who take the initiative to get tested obviously have a mind for staying healthy, and will likely take steps to have safe sex too.
The fact that you’ve gotten tested should be a point of pride. Asking someone about his or her STI status should not be awkward. It should be a regular conversation whenever you’re considering a new sexual partner.
There are several ways to start the conversation. First, let your partner know that you’ve been tested. That opens up the discussion to talk about his or her STI status too.
Make the conversation about health, and not necessarily about needing to know every detail about his or her past. Both partners benefit from being tested regardless of how many people they’ve had sex with before.
Lastly, use the tools available to facilitate this discussion. Organizations like Planned Parenthood offer advice on how to disclose your STI testing results and how to start the conversation with your partner about getting tested.
Knowing your current STI status, as well as using condoms, can help to keep you and your sex life happy and healthy. Oral sex is less risky, but health experts recommend using condoms or dental dams. If you are not sure you are ready to get tested, or if you have other questions about the different STIs, talk to your health care provider.
Comprehensive STI testing is available at the University Park Health Center. Anonymous Rapid HIV testing is offered at the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion, as are free condoms.
Online tools, such as Qpid.me, offer students a way to confirm STI test results and share them with others digitally and confidentially.
Getting tested for STIs might not be sexy, but staying free from STIs is.

It is not a good time for non-profit workers and activists right now.
In Egypt, 43 people working for pro-democracy nonprofits, including 16 foreigners, were charged in February with encouraging unrest in the post-revolutionary country. Because the groups they worked for took money from foreign governments, the activists were imprisoned on claims that they were dangerous spies.
Among these organizations are the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House — respectable groups not known for being dangerous, violent anarchists.
And worse yet, Egypt, after the ousting of dictator Hosni Mubarak, is still not a safe place for prisoners. Torture continues in the country and there are allegations of judicial abuse by both military and civilian tribunals. And even though some activists were released from the country on bail and the initial judges quit the proceedings, the state intends to go forward with the trial against the non-governmental organization workers.
With all those dangers, the idea of going into non-profit work sounds dangerous and scary. But that doesn’t mean it should be abandoned. In fact, the NGO crackdown in Egypt shows why these kinds of workers and activists are needed more than ever.
Around the world, nonprofits are hiring people to help others. Activists include teachers, engineers, scientists, political organizers and young people just like us. It’s direct civic engagement — just in another society. If you think you have something to contribute, there is more than likely a nonprofit out there willing to put you to work.
Working for an NGO can make for a bleak life; it might make you question why you got into it.
But that can all be worth it. This is the kind of work that makes the world a better place. The very factors that make non-profit work dangerous make it necessary.
Egypt’s case can’t be generalized. Yes, activists face constant danger in whatever country they’re in, but more than anything else, the NGO crackdown in Egypt is tied to the military aid Egypt’s rulers receive from the United States and the Supreme Council of Armed Forces’ attempts to control the populace.
In the United States, we speak about freedom and liberty and how we must defend those principles. But the United States’ freedoms are secure compared to many places in the world.
These are places where any form of open expression is silenced on penalty of death. These are places under the iron fist of violent dictators, and places that have just emerged from that grasp. They need help. This isn’t some case of first-world guilt or neocolonialism: It’s the idea that people should help their fellow humans.
If a group can go into another country and provide assistance, be it in the form of organizing aid or monitoring elections to ensure that they’re fair, then that group should be able to participate.
What’s happening in Egypt will likely end soon; the United States and the international community already wore the Supreme Council of Armed Forces down on releasing the foreign activists, and they might be able to free the Egyptian nationals still imprisoned. But in the long term, Egypt, and other countries like it, are rebuilding. Even those doing well still need help.
If we believe in democracy and helping others, we should turn our beliefs into action and offer our assistance.
