With the pandemic affecting resources for international communities, Aurora NK was formed to help North Korean refugees gain access to educational opportunities. Originally starting off with five members from USC and UCLA in the summer of 2020, Aurora NK has now become a California-based corporate entity with cooperation from all over the world that provides resources and help to North Koreans in the sectors of education, legal aid and healthcare.
The idea to create the organization came during a session of Liberty in North Korea at USC when Woori Lee talked to club president Jay Lee about the possibility of making an outside organization to help North Korean refugees. The talks led to research and an effort to begin networking with other people.
Woori, a senior majoring in human biology, said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic disrupted services designed to help international refugees, which inspired the formation of Aurora NK. 
“I’ve always been really interested in North Korea refugee issues because my grandfather was actually from North Korea, so I have seen how legal aspects can actually impact a person’s life,” Woori said. “Since several years ago, I have been helping North Korean refugees in different organizations, and during [the coronavirus pandemic], there were major changes in different organizations, in terms of helping North Korean refugees, and I was actually tutoring a few students.”
As a result, the tutoring program initiative of Aurora NK began. Under the education sector of the organization, the tutoring program connected college students from all across the world in places such as the United Kingdom and Australia and paired them up with refugee students for twice-a-week sessions over Zoom. With the tutoring program still operating, student tutors who wish to volunteer for Aurora NK must fill out an online application to indicate their interest. 
“I think one of the big things that people are surprised of is that Aurora is only composed of college students [meaning that] all the tutors and all the board members are college students,” Woori said. “I think it creates some sort of vibe to North Korean refugees where they can approach us more easily because we’re like friends.”
Giboom Park, a senior triple majoring in political science, international studies and history at Northwestern University, operates as one of the two directors in the education department of Aurora NK.
“We work to lead the education committee into first creating an agenda for what these tutors need to teach their students,” she said. “We also create the curriculum, and we also do recruitment in terms of students finding tutors worldwide, and finally, we both work in matching new students to tutors based on compatibility, based on what they’re each looking for and the different timezones that are available.”
Aurora NK registered as a corporate entity with the state of California earlier this year. While first starting off with the education program, Aurora NK later came to provide the services of legal aid and healthcare to North Korean refugees. According to Woori, the legal aid and healthcare resources took around eight to nine months to come to fruition. 
Sarah Kim, a junior majoring in law, history and culture and East Asian languages and cultures, serves as a legal aid committee member that helps the legal aid directors and conducts casework for specific needs of North Korean refugees. She helps refugees obtain visas because of her familiarity with the immigration process. 
“I would say that the purpose of legal aid specifically is [that] a lot of the time. North Korean refugees are more in the dark,” Kim said. “They’re kind of scared to come out because of what could happen to them potentially, so we try to keep our work very discreet. At the same time, they often lack resources and access to legal aid, so we want to serve as the point where they can reach out and feel more comfortable going for help.”
The legal aid department of Aurora NK provides citizenship and immigration resources for North Koreans living in the United States and South Korea. Refugees involved in the process would find themselves working alongside legal aid committee members and different pro bono law organizations and law firms. 
Kim also said that her work entails searching for pro bono law firms or pro bono lawyers that would be able to collaborate alongside the organization. As of now, the Parts Equality Center, a community-based social and legal services organization, and AHRI, a nonprofit organization that will provide free immigration consultation, have been the only two collaborators associated with Aurora NK. 
Kim even reached out to law schools, such as UCLA School of Law and New York University School of Law, in order to see if more help could be provided in areas where refugees would like to relocate to. Despite some unresponsiveness from the schools stemming from the fact that potential law students and not legal professionals would be available, Kim reached out to them in the case that they had human rights clinics or immigration clinics. 
“We were also reaching out to law schools,” she said. “We’ve emailed a bunch, but we’ve discovered along the way that there might be some unresponsiveness because of the lack of actual professionals. We might have overestimated what law school students could do, especially if they’re not in the L.A. area because we were contacting schools all over the country.”
Clients from the legal aid sector will sometimes come directly from the tutoring program. As of now, the sector is attempting to expand its network to more partners in order to provide more aid and translation services.
“We had about 40 refugees who we were dealing with [in] case work,” Kim said. “They specifically came up to us or we reached out to them, and they told us the issue that they needed help with.”
The healthcare sector of Aurora NK currently operates to help refugees by providing them with information on U.S. healthcare and the health insurance system and connecting them with free clinic opportunities. The organization is also in its initial stages to connect their clients with free dental clinic check-in services this year, Jay said. In addition to dental services, Woori said that Aurora NK intends to offer mental health resources such as a counseling and health education program.
“We’re actually preparing [a] mental health program with an organization called FREEMED, which is a nonprofit organization in South Korea providing free medical services and education to low income families and [underserved] populations, as well as projects that [are] initiated by the Ministry of Unification in South Korea,” Woori said. 
Aurora NK intends to continue serving the North Korean refugee population and wants to expand, including the possibility of serving other countries in need as well. Jay said that one long-term goal of the program is to even seek recognition from the United Nations and become a full-fledged, non-governmental organization.
“People that have suffered their whole lives in another country [are] facing different challenges that we can’t even imagine, and when they’re still struggling in the U.S., or wherever they decide to move to, it’s heartbreaking,” Jay said. “The fact that we can at least ease some of that for them is definitely the most rewarding part, and the fact that we can do it as an official organization, it really helps put into perspective what we can do for other people.”

After a year of Discord calls and virtual Zoom events, resident assistants now greet students in residence halls and enforce USC’s coronavirus guidelines. With the return to in-person learning, most students have moved into on-campus or nearby housing despite some ongoing uncertainties. With the Delta variant spreading among vaccinated individuals, USC has continued to keep its guard up by enforcing rules for on-campus housing, restricting guests and requiring Trojan Check to leave.  
However, ambiguity around rules concerning housing and campus life bother students such as Helen Spight, a sophomore majoring in computer science, who believes USC should increase  their transparency regarding preventative measures. 
“Even if you haven’t reached the conclusion, you can at least give a, ‘Here’s what we’re doing right now’ so people [are aware that you’re not] just sitting there and not doing anything,” Spight said.
Safety becomes a bigger problem with University housing students, with residential buildings at full capacity as a part of USC’s Phase 5 coronavirus response plan which also includes Trojan Check performed daily, mandatory vaccinations and libraries and dining halls functioning regularly. 
In the event that a student tests positive for the coronavirus, Dr. Kimberly Tilley, co-medical director at USC Student Health, said USC has a team that responds to each case through contact tracing and notifies people who may have been in contact with the individual. Upon testing positive for the coronavirus, students are required to quarantine for a minimum of 10 days in their own residences. If a student is unable to safely quarantine in their own space, they will be able to do so at another location such as the USC Hotel and its Downtown location, which together have over 600 spaces. 
Similar to the previous academic year, USC housing will have a no-guest policy. Although no outside guests are allowed within residential buildings, residents are allowed to visit rooms that are within the same building.Guidelines are subject to change to more lenient policies depending on the infection rate of the virus.
If someone is found with an outside guest inside their room, resident assistants will document the incident and contact their supervisors for the case to be addressed on an administrative level. Parties are also not allowed and students may even be charged a fine of up to $1000, according to the Los Angeles County Code of Ordinances. 
Sabrina Sy, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, is a RA for the McCarthy Honors residential college. Although she became an RA because she wanted to help students transition to college life, Sy has experienced some trouble navigating her RA responsibilities during the pandemic.
“I think it is pretty stressful because, not only am I responsible for keeping myself safe in a pandemic, but I’m also responsible for making sure that 500 other people in the building are following the rules too,” Sy said.
Sy has heard that there are residents breaking the no-guest policy, Sy said she wishes students would be less selfish in terms of following coronavirus guidelines for the safety of others. As a Los Angeles native, Sy feels frustrated that students aren’t recognizing that their actions affect the greater L.A. area outside of USC.
“I wish people were more responsible. I wish people thought about others, more so than just thinking about themselves and their own comfort levels,” Sy said. “In my personal opinion, selfishness is a really big thing that plays into why people aren’t doing what they need to do to protect others.” 
Spight, who lived off-campus during the 2020-2021 school year, said housing was not at full capacity and students did not have roommates in their dorms. To combat student loneliness and build a community, USC Residential Education created Virtual Peer Mentors to help guide first-year students through the online environment and build connections with other students. 
Despite her worries about students breaking coronavirus guidelines, Sy is excited to help create a space in the community for people to feel at home.
“Community is something that a lot of us have been lacking throughout this past year,” Sy said. “We want to be able to responsibly help people make up for that and be able to have a really great college experience.” 
Despite careful planning from the RAs, Thomas Manea, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said many of the coronavirus guidelines were followed throughout events such as Welcome Week. 
“You put a bunch of adolescents, college-aged people together, and then you add the nonchalant factor of hanging out, and then what you get, essentially, is only like 50% — maybe I’m being generous — wearing their masks at these events, so it probably is a [coronavirus] spreader,” Manea said.
Even with the coronavirus causing complications for students and staff, silver linings to living at home appeared for some students. Grace Sumitro, a junior majoring in health administration and health and the human sciences, has lived in Illinois for the past year and enjoyed becoming closer to her parents. Although she has also experienced a lot of self-growth, Sumitro is ready to go back to in-person learning and meet new people. 
“It’s going to be rocky for sure. I think I’m just preparing to give myself a lot more patience and grace as I go into [in-person learning], and giving other people patience too, because I know it’s gonna be hard for everyone,” Sumitro said. “It’s a big change for everyone to be back in-person.”
After two weeks of living near campus with five other students, Sumitro said the transition to in-person learning has been difficult because of little tasks such as walking to class and catching up with friends.
“I have been able to call my parents every day and just kind of update them on everything that’s going on,” Sumitro said. “It’s been so busy, not only just catching up with my friends and people that I haven’t seen in a really long time, but also the work that comes with being in-person for school for the first time in forever and just the little things that you don’t think about when we’re in online school.”

Innovative songwriter and author Michelle Zauner joined Professor of English, gender & sexuality studies, and American studies & ethnicity, Karen Tongson in a Zoom webinar Tuesday night hosted by Visions and Voices. Zauner discussed her debut memoir, “Crying in H Mart,” and relayed the lessons she learned as a writer and artist to the USC community. 
Published in April 2021, Zauner’s New York Times bestseller “Crying in H Mart” weaves together the grief of losing her mother to cancer as a young adult, the exploration of her biracial identity and her endeavors as an artist all through one universal necessity: food.
Throughout the seminar Zauner emphasized the power of food to heal and strengthen relationships. Zauner explained how making “quiet observations of people’s preferences” about food has taught her how to better love her friends and family members.
Zauner described college as one of several catalysts that helped her realize how food connected her to family. After reading a passage about her mother sending packages of her favorite Korean snacks during her college years, Zauner noted that college was also a time where she began to understand the complexities of her parents’ personalities.
“College, at least for me, [was] the beginning of realizing that my parents were human beings outside of just being my parents,” Zauner said. 
Another prominent theme of “Crying in H Mart” is Zauner’s negotiation with her multicultural background being both Korean and white. PhD candidate Samuel Garza had admired Zauner’s work prior to the event and was one of three USC students who had the opportunity to directly ask Zauner a question about how her racial identity influenced her artistic process.
“She talks a lot about her identity in her book, and I feel like being biracial is not a topic that gets addressed a lot,” Garza said. “I’m biracial as well, so to read a book and hear someone talking about their experiences about where they fit in and trying to deepen their connection to their identity really resonated with me.” 
Zauner’s “Crying in H Mart” was a New York Times bestseller and is now in the process of being adapted into a film. Despite her accolades, Zauner remains humble, grounding the release of her memoir by discussing her emotions prior to release.
“[I] was so nervous, honestly about the Asian American demographic and how they would read this,” Zauner said.
She continued by explaining her fear that she would be “perpetuating some kind of stereotype unintentionally,” but the reception of her memoir expelled any fears she may have held. The memoir “hit home” for the readers she hoped to resonate with the most such as Garza. 
During the event, Zauner read an excerpt from “Crying in H Mart” about her grappling with her identity around other Koreans.  
“It was the same way kids at school would look at me before they asked me what I was but from the opposite angle,” Zauner read.
Zauner believes that her efforts to actively engage with the Korean community, such as sharing her art and writing, were essential to being at peace with her identity. Visions and Voices Production Specialist David Delgado felt an event like this was necessary, especially off the heels of USC’s campus reopening. 
“We always centralize our programming in connection to students, as well as the intersections of art and equity,” Delgado said. “It seems like the perfect time to present an artist that is outspoken and eager to have dialogues that are about grief, that are about culture and [that are] about loss all through this narrative of art and food.” 
Near the conclusion of the forum it was clear that Zauner’s messages about using food to recall notions of culture and family resonated with several participants. Though food cannot always cure homesickness or loss, it can be a way to feel closer to our families and cultures.
Zauner concluded the webinar by discussing her favorite restaurants in Los Angeles, Korean musicians that she admires and, on a more serious note, how she dealt with sharing extraordinarily intimate life events with the public.
“My dad has been a really open book and would have been the first person to say a lot of what is in there,” Zauner said. “[He] was always very open with me about sharing, and I kind of inherited that from him.” 
Although the event was virtual, the energy of the attendees was palpable as students engaged in conversation in Zoom’s chat feature.  
“[When] we have these discussions like you know what are the experiences of a biracial person, I think that people become more sensitive to the experience of being stuck [at] a door between two worlds,” Garza said. “Hopefully, we can continue to have the conversation to make people feel more accepted for who they are and safe enough to connect with their identity.”

The United States Men’s National Team might actually be good at soccer. Let me explain.
This is a bold claim, and for those who don’t keep up with soccer in the states, it may even sound ridiculous. Soccer has never been our forte, and after suffering heartbreak in 2017 when the team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, it’s been hard to be optimistic about the team’s chances ahead of the next qualifying campaign. Nonetheless I, like many others, have stuck with our guys, patiently awaiting the revenge tour, our chance at redemption. 
2021 has been everything we’ve waited for. Two major wins in summer tournament finals — CONCACAF Nations League and the Gold Cup — over our Mexican rivals should be enough to get anyone hyped about the talent the USMNT has at the moment. For the first time since 2017, there’s hope surrounding the American camp ahead of the Octagon — a 14-game World Cup Qualifying format in which the U.S. plays seven other teams from North and Central America, with the top three spots gaining automatic qualification for the 2022 World Cup. 
Now that I’ve laid down the context, let me catch you up to speed. The USMNT played its first three games of the Octagon this week: at El Salvador, home against Canada and at Honduras. And everything that I just said about optimism, hope and whatever just got kicked to the curb. I went from genuinely excited to watch a talented group of players represent our nation to dreading the next time we play from the first to third game. How did this happen, you ask?
Believe me, I’ve got plenty to say. 
Let’s first take a look at the roster we’ve brought into the qualifiers. The household names are all there: Chelsea star 22-year-old Christian Pulisic, 18-year-old wonderkid Giovanni Reyna,  23-year-old Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie and 22-year-old defensive midfielder Tyler Adams. The only notable absences are the likes of Valencia midfielder Yunus Musah, who has been recovering from an injury, and Matthew Hoppe, the breakout attacker from the Gold Cup campaign. The roster contains an unprecedented amount of players who are competing at the highest levels of European soccer, thus the excitement around this team isn’t misguided. 
Of course, if the individuals don’t mesh, problems will arise, and that’s exactly what we’ve seen so far in the first three matches. Individuals can’t lead an attack by themselves, unless they’re Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, and the team has suffered from a lack of scoring opportunities. It’s a challenge that we’ve yet to see head coach Gregg Berhalter solve at the highest level. 
CONCACAF away matches are no joke, especially in a raucous atmosphere such as the stadium in El Salvador. That statement was the prevailing excuse after a 0-0 tie in the first game of the campaign in which a clearly inexperienced U.S. team played a disjointed brand of soccer.
Throughout the game, link-up play was difficult because players were spread out, and the press from the opposition defense stifled any creativity going forward. It was a grueling game to watch, especially because it was the ever-so-hyped-up first game of World Cup Qualifying. It’s worth noting that Pulisic didn’t play against El Salvador, as he was still recovering from coronavirus. It’s also worth noting that, from the way that game looked, even Pulisic wouldn’t have made a difference in the result. 
So the next test was Canada at home in Nashville, in a game that already felt like a must-win. Dropping points at home simply won’t be enough in the Octagon without stellar road performances. And yet, to no one’s surprise by now, the Americans could only manage a 1-1 draw. I would call it an improvement, and this game was at least more fun to watch; However, this one probably hurt more than the first game. Winger Brenden Aaronson found the breakthrough, only for Canada to score a replica of the U.S. goal five minutes later. The U.S. once again lacked ideas going forward, and even with dominance in possession, they were unable to find the net when they needed to. 
But what could possibly be worse than a poor performance on the field? Well, of course, off-field issues. McKennie was sent back to Italy after playing in the first match because he was in violation of team coronavirus bubble protocols. After a full frenzy of rumors and reporters trying to figure out what McKennie did, it was discovered that he spent one night outside the bubble and invited someone into the bubble on a separate night. Berhalter had no choice but to send him back to his club, leaving the U.S. without their best box-to-box midfielder. This was literally the last thing that the team needed, and all the drama surrounding it couldn’t have made for a worse distraction for an already underachieving team.
Last but not least, Honduras. By far the most entertaining affair, this game ran the gamut of my emotions, from rage to sadness, then for a moment hope again (when will I learn?), then pain, then ultimately ecstasy. That joy was the result of a go-ahead goal by striker Ricardo Pepi in the 75th minute, leading to an eventual 4-1 win on the road. It was a huge three points — after a dreadful first half, Berhalter made all the right subs and the U.S. ultimately snagged its first win of the Octagon. The bad news (because of course there’s bad news) was Pulisic’s injury, which forced him off the pitch in the 62nd minute. 
So what did we gain out of these first three games? Five points total, a few injuries and a new dramatic storyline in the saga of McKennie. Where do we go from here? For starters, we need to have a moment of reckoning with Berhalter. It’s his job to inspire the team tactically, and if he can’t do that, we need to move on quickly. His questionable team choices and delayed substitutions have directly impacted results. The substitutions in the Honduras game are hopefully indicative of improvement from him in that regard. Some will say we need to give our managers time to work things out, but we don’t have time. Every single game in the Octagon is make-or-break, and we have to draw a line with poor results somewhere. 
It’s not just the manager, it’s the players too. These guys are competing in European competitions against the best players in the world, but when they come to represent their country, they look uninspired. That’s not gonna fly, especially with our top players who should be bossing it at this level of competition. Whether it’s a matter of dropping players from the starting lineup or from the roster as a whole, there has to be accountability. We saw first hand what passion and determination looks like in the second half against Honduras, as the players buckled down and completed the comeback.
Frankly, I was expecting a lot better from the U.S. in World Cup qualifiers, but there may still be reason for optimism. Let’s just hope the USMNT can get its act together so all of this excitement and talent doesn’t go to waste.

Tequila, gelato and mosh pits seem to have little in common besides being sources of fun. For Sumit — an artist who puts fun at the center of his music and personality — tequila, gelato and mosh pits aren’t just seemingly unrelated things, they’re all titles for energetic and playful hip hop songs within his discography.  
A junior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation at the Iovine and Young Academy — Sumit is an example of how all three disciplines come together. But to truly understand him as an artist, you need to start at the beginning.
Sumit was born in Cleveland. He then moved to Orlando when he was five, then to Shanghai and finally to New Hampshire where he finished high school before coming to USC. Growing up, Sumit said he loved to play basketball and listen to music.
“I would always just memorize lyrics,” Sumit said. “I would know the whole new Eminem or Lil Wayne song by heart.” 
He always knew he wanted to make music. That path, though, wasn’t always clear cut. 
“My dad was an engineer, and my brother [is] an engineer,” Sumit said. “In high school, I was really, really good at physics and math and everything like that. And everywhere, except USC, I applied as an engineer, but I just knew that it’s not really what I wanted to do.” 
After getting accepted to IYA, Sumit felt free to figure out what career he truly wanted to pursue. In his time at USC, Sumit has released eight songs on his Spotify profile, which has accumulated over 9,000 monthly listeners. 
Sumit’s music is energetic, fun and easygoing. That’s intentional. His approach to making music is very performance driven, so when he makes a song, he constantly thinks about the way the tune would sound to a live audience. 
“I knew that performance was something I wanted to do, so it kind of shaped how I started making music for years, even before I started performing,” Sumit said. 
Providing a source of escapism is another drive to his approach, and it is one Sumit has also found consolation in. He hopes his music and performances can cause that same solace for others. One way that he’s sharing his love for music and performance is through his brainchild “Tiny Dorm,” which was inspired by NPR’s “Tiny Desk.” 
“Tiny Dorm” is an intimate performance series that Sumit started last year with Contains: Eggs, a student-run media and production company. 
“Even though the idea isn’t brand new — of having an artist in an intimate setting — I think it’s really, really special and the people that have gone to them in person… can attest to that,” Sumit said. 
“I know a lot of artists are like, ‘this is mine that I want to do in my way,’” Sumit said. “But ultimately, I make music for people to listen to and enjoy.” 
Although Sumit is an independent artist, he doesn’t work alone. He describes his creative process to be very collaborative because he wants everyone to enjoy his music. He sends demos back-and- forth between his friends for advice on how to maximize the excitement in his songs. One person that has helped him with this process is Simon Cantor, a junior also majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. 
“Sumit and I met our freshman year of college, and it was the first week of school,” Cantor said. “I’d already been making music just for fun for about two or three years, I was like, ‘yo, come over I want to show you some beats, see if you can do anything with it.’” 
Cantor said they eventually made “Moshpit,” a trap song with booming basses and a rapid lyrical flow, together in his dorm room. Since then, Cantor has produced most of the songs on Sumit’s Spotify, such as “Cholula” and “Gelato.” Mya Davis, another frequent collaborator of Sumit’s, is also a junior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation and helped create “Moshpit” in Cantor’s dorm room. With so many people collaborating on one song, issues might arise deciding what the final product should look like, but Davis describes a different story. 
“I mean, it comes so easily working with him, because he’s a friend first,” Davis said. “What I see in Sumit is just a constant, overflowing abundance of love and joy for other people, and himself. The boy’s really, really confident, and it’s contagious.” 
Cantor shared similar sentiments and called Sumit the “biggest goofball ever.” Sumit’s good energy isn’t exclusive to his songs, but a part of him that he shares with the world. 
“I really just love cheering people on, making people laugh, making people smile, making people dance,” Sumit said. “That’s kind of what I’m about, just energy and happiness, and I think it radiates if I spread it to four people, they’ll spread it to four people each, and it’s just like, exponential.”

There are currently over 30 former USC football players in the National Football League. With the NFL season kicking into gear this week, it’s time to take a deeper look at eight impactful ex-Trojan players and what their upcoming seasons will look like. 
Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions
Wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown will look to make an immediate impact in his rookie season for the Detroit Lions. St. Brown impressed some around the league with his preseason debut Aug. 13. Despite only catching two passes for 12 yards, St. Brown continued to display the crisp route running and footwork that brought him from Los Angeles to the Motor City. 
With the wide receiver corps of the Lions looking below average on paper, it would not be a surprise to see St. Brown get some decent playing time in his rookie season. 
Alijah Vera-Tucker, New York Jets
The Jets selected offensive guard and former Trojan Alijah Vera-Tucker No. 14 in the draft, and they are eager to get him on the field. New York also chose Zach Wilson as its future quarterback with the No. 2 overall pick. It’s clear the Jets will do whatever it takes to protect Wilson and avoid making the same mistakes they did with Sam Darnold. 
Vera-Tucker was sidelined during the preseason due to a pectoral injury, but he is planning to play in the first game of the season and is ready to “dominate,” as he stated in an interview with USA Today Sports. Vera-Tucker believes the Jets picked him for a reason and he is ready to fire on all cylinders.
Sam Darnold, Carolina Panthers 
Speaking of Sam Darnold, the former USC quarterback will be at the helm of a new team this season. After spending the first three years of his career with the Jets, he was traded to the Carolina Panthers this offseason. Although the situation in Carolina is not much better than it was in New York, Darnold played better in the preseason than he has in the past. He closed out the preseason with a steady performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers, completing 19 of 25 passes for 162 yards and two touchdowns.
The Panthers face the Jets in week one as Darnold will look for revenge against the team that chose to replace him with a rookie quarterback. A new environment can change a lot of things, so the league could see a new Sam Darnold this year. 
JuJu Smith-Schuster, Pittsburgh Steelers
Everyone’s favorite TikToker is entering his fifth season in the league, and the wide receiver is facing a lot of questions from the media, mainly surrounding where his focus lies. People seem to doubt he can be a No. 1 wide receiver and a social media influencer at the same time. While it is true that Smith-Schuster’s numbers have dipped since his monster 2018 season, it is hard to ignore the fact that he is now sharing the field with three other talented wide receivers in Diontae Johnson, James Washington and Chase Claypool. Smith-Schuster will look to prove the haters wrong and become veteran quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s favorite target. 
Ronald Jones II, Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Coming off a Super Bowl victory, running back Ronald Jones II and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are looking to make magic again. Although the Buccaneers backfield is relatively crowded — also featuring Leonard Fournette and Giovani Bernard — the former Trojan’s explosiveness during the final preseason game was hard to ignore. He finished off his game against the Houston Texans with a 13-yard touchdown run where he bounced to the outside after the blocking in front of him collapsed.
Jones II will continue to be a key part of the Buccaneers’ offense this season, even if he may not be the official No. 1 running back on the depth chart. 
Robert Woods,  Los Angeles Rams 
The energy is high in Los Angeles. With new quarterback Matthew Stafford, the Rams made a huge upgrade to their passing game. This will undoubtedly benefit former USC wide receiver Robert Woods, who continuously put up stellar numbers with Jared Goff at quarterback over the past few years. Woods has had 180 catches over the past two seasons with the Rams. In his eighth season, Woods will be catching passes from one of the top quarterback talents in the league. 
Serving as the true No. 1 wide receiver, Woods should be one of Stafford’s favorite targets this season. The Rams’ offense is revamped and there is some excitement regarding what head coach Sean McVay can do with Stafford at signal-caller. 
Michael Pittman Jr., Indianapolis Colts
Things look bleak for the Indianapolis Colts’ passing game. As they enter the Carson Wentz era, no one is really sure what version of Wentz the Colts will get. Will they get the stud that was a possible MVP candidate in Philadelphia, or will they get an injury prone, turnover machine? This uncertainty does not bode well for ex-Trojan wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. who is coming off a decent rookie season, racking up over 500 yards on just 40 receptions in 13 games. 
The only question surrounding Pittman Jr. is whether or not Wentz can produce chances for him. If Wentz returns to his former self, Pittman should have no problem churning out great numbers. 
Adoree’ Jackson, New York Giants 
After only playing three games last season for the Tennessee Titans, cornerback Adoree’ Jackson is hoping to make an impressive comeback and immediate impact for his new team, the New York Giants. The Giants definitely needed help on the defensive side of the ball, so Jackson’s addition will be welcomed.
Jackson will be on the opposite side of the field as Pro Bowler James Bradberry, meaning he may see some more favorable matchups against No. 2 wide receivers. Jackson should be able to make a meaningful impact on the Giants’ defense this year, if he can stay healthy.

In late August, Hurricane Ida touched down in Louisiana, with remnants of the storm pouring excessive amounts of rain into places as far north as New York. I’ve anxiously watched videos of the storm devour my social media feed. One video showed folks sitting out on their porch, watching as torrential rain pelted down, only to disappear in the floodwaters that surrounded their houses. 
Another video showed strong currents pushing a house against a row of trees; another showed strong winds pulling the roof off a hospital in southern Louisiana. After finishing a video, I would dive right into the comment section or Tweet thread, bracing myself for a repeat of the comments I saw on social media when Texas was slammed with a snowstorm earlier this year.
Many comments underneath the videos were, for the most part, empathetic toward those caught in the hurricane’s deadly path. Many offered prayers, and others inquired about how they could best support evacuation efforts. Celebrities and politicians, such as former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, posted lists of organizations supporting relief efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi and other areas affected by Hurricane Ida. 
There was something refreshing about seeing well-known liberals offer action instead of bad takes in the middle of this catastrophe. Outside the context of extreme weather events, you’ll find a large number of tweets, comments and general statements generalizing the South as an irredeemable place full of dumb, ignorant rednecks. However, recent extreme weather events have brought out the worst in liberals who have decided that political affiliation should be a death sentence. 
Take Texas for example. Earlier this February, Texas experienced a freezing winter storm that caused widespread power outages — and, as of July 14, the death toll from that storm continues to rise. In the middle of that storm, left-leaning personalities took to Twitter to give hot takes that, quite frankly, nobody asked for. 
Perhaps the worst Tweet came from author Stephen King, who tweeted, “Hey Texas! Keep voting for officials who don’t believe in climate change and supported privatization of the power grid! Maybe in 4 years you can vote for Trump again. He believes in the latter but not the former. Perfect.” 
There’s a lot to unpack in that tweet alone. It can be summed up with this: It rather snidely told millions of Texans that they got what they deserved — freezing temperatures and rolling power outages, all for being reliably red in the past 6 presidential elections. Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there. 
A few weeks after Texas’s snowstorm, filmmaker Michael Moore delivered a left hook and an uppercut to Texans in a tweet following the state’s lift on its mask mandate mere weeks after the snowstorm. It read: “Texas – we hear you. You didn’t want to be part of our electrical grid. And now you’ve removed your mask mandates & are allowing large crowds to gather. We hear you! COVID is a hoax! So u don’t need our precious vaccine. We’ll send it to ppl who are saving lives by wearing masks.” Let’s all be glad Michael Moore isn’t President Joe Biden’s coronavirus czar or in the healthcare field since he seems to think that political affiliation and geographic location are prerequisites for lifesaving vaccines.
It is rather disappointing that Stephen King and Michael Moore both possess an incredibly juvenile understanding of the complex political history of Southern states, especially that of Texas. Former President Donald Trump only won the state by 6.5% in the 2020 presidential election, the narrowest margin of victory since 1996, and recent demographic changes in the Lone Star State paint it as a future battleground state in the years to come. Texas is not a state full of white conservatives as millions of Black and Indigenous people and people of color, liberals and progressives have called it home. In fact, Texas has a long history of discriminating against voters of color, who are often left-leaning, thanks to gerrymandering efforts that continue to render their votes obsolete.
Texas’s political history brings up several important questions: Do liberal and progressive Texans deserve to freeze to death because of the decisions made by politicians they didn’t vote for? Do BIPOC Texans deserve it? Additionally, do Republican-voting Texans deserve the same fate simply because of who they voted for? 
Replace all of the mentions of Texans above with Louisianians. Louisiana is, in fact, more deeply red than Texas. If we, as a nation, still can’t answer “no” to all the questions above, then we’ve got to give ourselves a long, hard look in the mirror. The moment we become comfortable telling the other side that they had death coming when they checked off a box on a ballot that was different from ours, we value political groupthink more than empathy and care for our neighbors.
So, after Hurricane Ida subsides and Louisianians start the rebuilding effort, I urge my fellow liberals to retain some empathy for millions in the South who are having to pick up the scattered pieces of their life. If we really want to live up to the values of empathy and compassion that we always preach about, let’s redeem ourselves for how we treated Texas and start practicing what we preach down in Louisiana.

Back in March, the University made it clear that classes would be in-person for the 2021-2022 school year. After over a year of online learning, most students made the decision to return to brick-and-mortar classrooms this fall in order to stimulate a more interactive and intimate educational experience. 
Students who registered for certain courses under the impression that they were in-person, synchronous lectures and labs are now discovering that the University unexpectedly switched said classes to hybrid or fully online formats. Because the University did not originally notify those students that their classes would be hybrid or online, it is unfair of them to implement those unanticipated changes.
If the USC administration was truly confident in its execution of the “swiss cheese” coronavirus defense model — including measures such as enforcing daily Trojan Check wellness assessments and weekly saliva testing — then there would not be a concern for in-person classes. And if the school was comfortable enough to hold crowded social events, such as the Welcome Concert, and consequently boast footage of hordes of unmasked attendees on their Instagram page, then surely the preservation of physical academic spaces would be of an even higher priority. 
The University’s focus is backward. Over the past few weeks, the dining halls have been egregiously crowded, with long lines, overworked staff and little to no enforcement of social distancing. Pair this with a lack of disciplinary action against members of Greek life who have been endangering the USC and South Los Angeles communities with excessive — and unmasked — partying. It seems like the University is using the switch to hybrid and fully online learning as an eleventh-hour opportunity to save face — and money. 
It is also worth pointing out that the University waited to announce these changes until after tuition for the semester was due. In fact, on Aug. 5, President Carol L. Folt announced in a fall semester update, “We are on track for a return to the full breadth of in-person academic, research, clinical, and service activities after nearly 18 months of video classes and Zoom meetings.” If nothing else, this statement was misleading to students who were yearning to break free from Zoom fatigue.
Besides, with a current positivity rate of 0.4% for students and 0.9% for employees, it appears that USC has the virus relatively under control on campus. There should definitely be an option for students who are immunocompromised, otherwise at risk, or just uncomfortable with in-person instruction to join classes via virtual format; students must be given that choice instead of being caught by surprise when their courses change formats to hybrid or fully online models.
Additionally, these swift adjustments could negatively impact students with disability accommodations that are incompatible with online learning. U.S. News & World Report details a survey from the Association on Higher Education and Disability that found that “students with disabilities were more likely to experience difficulty with accessing the internet, technology training and support, course materials and assessments, as well as using learning management systems and communicating with instructors.” Reporters for Axios describe how certain students with disabilities depend on in-person learning in order to “pick up on social cues and further develop socially and behaviorally.” 
In an article for CNN, special education specialist Sara Finegan explains that “what works in general education doesn’t work for special education students. New concepts must be broken down into manageable parts, taught in isolation and practiced a lot. That’s really hard to do in digital learning, even if you’re a terrific teacher.” Students facing learning challenges cannot be left behind.
USC must reconsider its transition of classes from in-person to online formats and instead offer students the choice to access their courses virtually. This will make academics more accessible to students with disabilities. Given the context of the school’s coronavirus policies and its relatively successful test rates, this option makes the most sense as an important step forward in returning to some sense of normalcy.
