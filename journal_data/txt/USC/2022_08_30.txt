More than seven months after its establishment, the Advisory Committee on Jewish Life at USC released its final report Aug. 23. Addressed to President Carol Folt, the report includes recommendations for combatting antisemitism on campus and otherwise ensuring an “equitable and inclusive” experience for members of the Jewish community.
“Over the last several years, there has been a dramatic rise of public antisemitism in the United States that has also impacted USC,” Dean of Religious Life and JLAC chair Varun Soni wrote, beginning the report. “We have witnessed antisemitic social media attacks against our students and others, and wrestled with how to best reconcile our commitment to expansive free speech with our responsibility to keep our community safe, secure, and free from threats and intimidation.”
The recommendations include clarifying official definitions of antisemitism and anti-Zionism, highlighting the work of Jewish organizations and individuals in official University communications, establishing kosher and halal food stations at dining halls, expanding training and educational programs to include Jewish perspectives and establishing the JLAC to serve in a standing capacity while it oversees the implementation of its recommendations.
“Please note that these recommendations do not constitute an exhaustive list but rather an important starting point,” the report read. “Many of these recommendations are underway or have already been implemented. Our goal is to audit these recommendations in one year from the date of this report’s submission to determine progress and assess additional needs.”
Folt accepted the report, writing in a University-wide letter Aug. 23 that her administration will continue to “work with this committee to implement its recommendations.”
Folt convened the committee in January following a months-long controversy surrounding tweets expressing antisemitic and anti-Zionist views that were posted last spring and summer — the aftermath of which included faculty open letters, death threats, FBI involvement and several University statements. In a community-wide email dated Jan. 13, Folt announced the University would be “taking specific new actions to systematically and operationally combat antisemitism on our campuses,” including the creation of the JLAC — with Soni as chair and 16 other members, two of them student leaders from USC Hillel and Chabad.
On the day the report was released, the USC Hillel building suffered property damage in what some social media users speculated to be an antisemitic act. In a statement Aug. 23 to USC’s Jewish community, Hillel executive director Dave Cohn wrote that “we do not yet know the motives or identities of any involved, and are not yet prepared to characterize the incident.” The Department of Public Safety said it is investigating the incident and, at the time of publication, had not released further details. 
Far from being isolated incidents, antisemitism has continued an upward trend in the past few years, both at USC and at other universities across the country, Soni wrote in an emailed statement to the Daily Trojan.
“Antisemitism is both an ancient and contemporary form of hate, and one-third of Jewish students in the United States have personally experienced antisemitism,” Soni wrote. “In my role, I saw public antisemitism in higher education explode after neo-Nazis marched across the University of Virginia’s campus in 2017.”
The JLAC held five meetings over the course of seven months, interspersed with separate listening sessions hosted by Soni, during which students outside of the committee recounted their experiences with antisemitism.
The first meeting, Soni said, was for JLAC members to “collectively [decide] which issues to address.” By the time the report was finalized, these issues were identified under seven categories: defining antisemitism, defining anti-Zionism in relation to antisemitism, University communications, human resources and University policies, student life, research and education and DEI initiatives and training. 
Subsequent meetings solicited a diverse array of perspectives to draft the 25 recommended solutions — not including the recommendation to establish a standing committee —  listed in the report. Committee involvement ranged from USC Hillel and other student input — Soni said members “heard courageous and heartbreaking stories from Jewish students at USC” — to outside community organizations, including the Los Angeles branches of the Anti-Defamation League and American Jewish Committee. Professors of Jewish studies at colleges throughout the city were also included. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Cohn said such diverse membership “was an effort to try and bring in representative voices of Jewish community organizations that represent a wide breadth of community beyond campus.”
“Jewishness is very complex and very internally diverse,” Cohn said. “The idea of fully representing the entire Jewish community on any issue is often a challenging one. But I think that one of the qualities of the committee dialogue I felt best about was its openness to hearing all of us. And that was really part of what contributed to having such a comprehensive report.”
When asked about tangible changes to student life, Soni cited the report’s recommendations on clarifying definitions and student protections, as well as the addition of kosher and halal bars at dining halls in collaboration with USC Hospitality. Soni said these kinds of changes “will make our campus more welcoming and inclusive for Jewish students.”
Cohn noted that tangible impact was an “area of tension” in the committee.
“A lot of the grappling on the committee stemmed from figuring out where we have room to make an impact that students will feel,” Cohn said, “because we got a sense of all the different legal and procedural and code structures that already theoretically support students in difficult situations. And we were trying to balance that against people’s lived experiences and come up with solutions that are effective and act quickly.”
Cohn said there was still “more work to do” in that regard, but that the report “does a great job of illustrating those areas” that need further attention.
“I’m very grateful to the members of the committee for their deep discussions and thoughtful collaboration,” Soni said, “and I’m especially thankful to President Folt for convening us.”
Soni said he is looking to convene the Muslim Life Advisory Committee this year with Folt’s administration “and to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to support Muslim students on campus.”
USC Hillel President Zach Gordon, a senior majoring in economics/mathematics and psychology, said he appreciates the University’s response in “taking steps to make the Jewish family feel very safe.” 
“USC is a premier destination for Jewish life on campus, worldwide. It was true before this, it’s going to be true after this,” Cohn said. “I fear we’ll never live in a world that’s free of hate; we’ll never live in a world that’s free of antisemitism. And so it’s our responsibility to institute the right policy framework for our contemporary time.”

The University launched a designated website Monday to provide information and guidelines to the campus community about monkeypox. The viral disease, spread through close interactions and often sexual contact, still poses a low risk to the general United States population. Monkeypox cases in Los Angeles County and nationwide appear to be plateauing, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said during a briefing held Monday with the Daily Trojan. 
The L.A. County Department of Public Health has identified criteria for increased risk of monkeypox infection. Those with higher risk include individuals who are immunocompromised and those who have engaged in sexual activity with multiple partners within the past 21 days. 
Monkeypox vaccines remain in short supply, so students are recommended to review the risk criteria for monkeypox and, as needed, sign up for the L.A. County Monkeypox newsletter to be updated on the latest vaccine availability, Van Orman said. 
L.A. County recently announced new availability of vaccines for higher-risk groups. Starting Aug. 26, the L.A. County Department of Public Health opened new walk-up sites where eligible groups can receive their first and second doses of the monkeypox vaccine. 
Students are able to schedule testing for monkeypox through the mySHR portal. 
The number of coronavirus cases at USC continues to be on the rise over the past week, an increase that is expected given students are returning to campus and moving around, Van Orman said. At the time of publication, students, staff and faculty reported 204 positive cases and close to 400 students were in isolation. 
Several cases are reinfections, Van Orman said. The rates of reinfection among students are uncertain because the University does not have records of all original positive tests. Thousands of students were infected during the omicron variant surge in December 2021 and January 2022. It is important for students to be aware that previous infection with an earlier variant does not protect them from the prevalent omicron BA.5 variant currently circulating, Van Orman said. If students start displaying symptoms, they should immediately get tested. 
While Student Health is still encouraging mask-wearing indoors for protection against the coronavirus, it does not anticipate reinstating campus-wide masking and testing requirements. 
Student Health recognizes the support faculty gives to students when they miss class will vary depending on the nature of each class but advises students to stay home when they are sick.
“The most important thing we can do relative to COVID is for people to stay home when they’re sick, and for people to feel like they can stay home when they’re sick without suffering any kind of academic or personal consequences,” Van Orman said.
Students should never be asked to provide medical verification for short-term illnesses, Van Orman said. Student Health has encouraged students struggling to receive support in the event of absences to reach out to their school’s dean. 
The deadline for students to take the required online prevention education modules, including Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergraduates and Sexual Assault Prevention for Graduate Students, passed Aug. 22. Students received notifications about the requirements through the month of August. As of a week ago, 95% of incoming students have completed their required courses, and roughly 75% of both undergraduate and graduate students who are required to take the new Sexual Assault Prevention Ongoing: Taking Action course have completed it, Van Orman said.
Last week, a registration hold was placed on students who had not completed the course. The hold will be lifted within 24 hours once the course is completed.

It’s pretty early in the semester and if you’re sitting in your dorm wondering what to do in Los Angeles (there’s a lot), then you might want to check out some of these flea markets in the area. They’re not too far from campus if you drive, so get that one friend that brought their car to campus or carpool with a friend or two and split the Uber bill to go find some hidden gems.
Los Feliz Flea
Located in Los Feliz, this flea market requires a mere 30-minute drive and they’re open every Saturday from 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. As one of the most well-known flea markets in L.A. County, @losfelizflea on Instagram boasts over 58k followers. The Los Feliz Flea is filled with tons of things to do. There’s loads of food trucks posted at the venue, along with dozens upon dozens of vendors that sell a multitude of items, from collectibles to art pieces to vintage clothing and many other items. The best part is that there’s free admission and free parking as well, although it may be limited because of this flea’s popularity. It’s also open rain or shine, so there’s no worries of having to cancel plans unless some unexpected natural disaster hits L.A.
Black Market Flea
Located at The Beehive on East 60th St., Black Market Flea hosts a ton of Black-owned businesses. It’s another one of L.A.’s well-known markets that attracts a huge crowd. They only host their markets once a month, so they build up quite a deal of hype when they come around. While it is free admission, they recommend you buy a ticket to guarantee entrance into the market. Admission’s relatively cheap, coming at a price of only $12. They also tend to bring entertainment for people to vibe out to. Last February, Black Market Flea brought out Duckwrth to perform alongside so it’s definitely worth keeping an eye out and marking your calendar when they announce their next flea market which you can find on their Instagram @blackmarketflea. 
Melrose Trading Post
Located on Melrose Avenue, this flea market is hosted at Fairfax High School weekly every Sunday. While it’s not a free flea market, it’s only five dollars to get in. The Melrose Trading Post also has live music performances. Typically, they bring local artists to give them a platform to perform and give people new artists to follow if they enjoyed their music. They always have three different acts for each Sunday, lasting around an hour typically per set, with the first one starting at 11:15 a.m. and the last performance ending at 4:15 p.m. Melrose Trading Post opens its doors at 9 a.m. and closes up shop at 5 p.m. so there’s plenty of time and wiggle room to plan your Sunday out and squeeze in a visit to MTP. Vendors at Melrose typically sell art pieces, home decor, antiques, clothes and a bunch of other goods that may pique your interest. 
Silverlake Flea
Silverlake Flea is in Echo Park, in close proximity to the Dodgers Stadium. It’s located on Sunset Boulevard, and it’s around a 30-minute drive to get there. On their website, they liken it to the Melrose Trading Post but “on a cuter, smaller scale that’s not as overwhelming to browse and shop.” They’re open every Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. respectively. It’s full of all different kinds of vendors from clothing to food to art and so much more. 
El Faro Plaza 
Last, but not least, we have El Faro Plaza. It’s a swap meet only 15 minutes away from campus, setting up base on South Alameda Street. It’s probably the one that is easiest to plan a day out to head on over. They are open six days a week, with the market being closed on Tuesdays. On weekdays, they open at 10 a.m., but on weekends they open an hour earlier and close at 7 p.m. on each day of operation. They also sell a wide assortment of items from electronics to car parts to clothes, just to name a few. It’s also indoors so you won’t have to worry about standing outside if some crazy heat storm hits L.A.
While these obviously aren’t the only flea markets in L.A., with plenty more scattered around the county, they’re definitely ones to keep an eye out for. Maybe you’ll find your next grail piece for your closet or an art piece you’ll want to stare at in your dorm.

Atlanta and Dreamville artist JID released his long-awaited third studio album, “The Forever Story,” Friday. For some, JID has always been under the shadow of head labelmate and hip-hop star J. Cole, but his collaboration with Imagine Dragons on “Enemy” and his latest project has allowed JID mainstream success and established himself as one of the biggest rappers in the game within his own right. While he could’ve easily chosen to capitalize off of his newfound mainstream success and change his sound, he chose to stick to his core music style.
Throughout his career, JID has put out some of the most lyrical and flawless records among his peers. His debut project on Dreamville, “The Never Story,” vaulted him from the Atlanta underground scene and landed his name in more mainstream conversations. His second album, “DiCaprio 2,” began to grow upon this success, with the track “151 Rum” appearing in popular HBO show “Euphoria.” Outside of features on his label’s collaborative albums, JID refrained from putting out new music for some time, leaving his core fanbase in the dark.
Before the album was released, JID dropped the single, “Surround Sound,” featuring 21 Savage and Baby Tate, as a sort of a preview of what was to come on the album. The song samples Mos Def’s 1999 hit, “Ms. Fat Booty,” and showcases his wide range of beat selection.
The album starts off strong with the second track, “Raydar,” which features a beat switch in the middle that lets JID show off more of his versatility and lyricism. The album then transitions into more of a boom bap mode, with JID enlisting the help of fellow Atlanta artists Kenny Mason and EARTHGANG to soulfully explore his upbringing in East Atlanta. With this album, JID continues to demonstrate a pride in his background that is prevalent throughout his music. This love for his hometown is common in Atlantans and is shown all throughout the album.
Two tracks that stuck out the most were “Bruddanem,” and “Sistanem.” On “Bruddanem” — a play on popular Chicago slang word foenem, meaning family — JID enlists the help of Chicago-based rapper Lil Durk to declare their loyalty to their brothers, both blood and not. On the flip side, he uses “Sistanem,” which features James Blake, to show some vulnerability, discussing how his newfound fame fractured his relationship with one of his sisters. While talking about how important and influential she is in his life, he delivers an introspective piece about how fame has changed him.
On “Sistanem,” JID raps “Look, I never gave that much a fuck about this shit / To let it challenge my integrity / But you questionin’ me, got me thinkin’ you thinkin’ less of me,” and acknowledges the transformation he’s made since becoming famous, but also how fame affects his relationship with the values that he came from.
The conclusion of the album is quite confusing in relation to the rest of the project. Similar to “Raydar,” “Lauder Too” presents a longer song with a beat switch, but the beats couldn’t be more drastically different from each other. This, however, is what makes JID a great artist: His ability to adapt to any and everything both lyricially and melodically.
In all, “The Forever Story” is an amazing album and a contender for rap album of the year thus far. While it has some glaring faults, including some features that feel unnecessary or could’ve been suited for other songs, the album continues to build upon the modern day legend of JID. He recaptures the sound that made so many dedicated hip-hop fans fall in love with him right before the turn of the decade.

As the school year ramps up, choosing a parking spot may be a decision that you’ve already made — even though that’s something that all the responsible students did in the summer. But if you’re one of the few still in a jam about where you should sit and yell about a minor inconvenience in your car, let me provide some helpful context on what your chosen parking structure means about you.
“But Lois,” you, the traveling Trojan, ask. “What if I have all my classes in just one building? Isn’t my decision basically already made for me in terms of what structure to park in? Can I really be judged on that alone?”
While I both don’t rely on my astrological sign to determine how bad I am in relationships and I act as a Downey Way loyalist, I encourage you to diversify your parking and check out the rooftop views at sunset (as your USC parking permit permits). So, let’s talk parking and personality.
Downey Way
Shoutout to all my Downey Way brethren. We have to deal with the fact that the closest viable exit on Vermont has been thwarted by construction. However, we can make do with the other entrances on Exposition and McClintock for the meantime. If you are one of the people who parks their unnecessarily large SUV in the compact parking areas, know that we all have to compensate for something every now and then.
Jefferson Boulevard
Y’all a parking lot?
Royal Street
LOL nerd, you parked near the library. You might occasionally see some freshmen scouring around the lot, dancing around or making TikToks or smoking weed — I’m not really sure what they’re doing half of the time.
McCarthy Way
As much as I hated fighting with rideshare drivers just to get into the lot, I am a secret sympathizer of the McCarthy Way folks. Located near the libraries, McCarthy Quad and those beach volleyball courts that generate endless championships, this parking structure has its fair share of nice views. You adore these views too, but hate the fact that you’re adjacent to the troublesome freshmen dorms.
Figueroa Street
Solid placement if you’re on the Marshall side or if you are vibing at the USC Hotel. You take a great deal of pride in your ride, noting the carded gates and mechanical doors that make your parking structure a concrete and metal sage.
Flower Street
I usually don’t let minor things bother me, but my ex parked here once, so this building officially means you are dumb. Apart from that, the lot is also a nice spot for Marshall and Tuscany students.
Grand Avenue
You forgot to sign up for parking or really love traversing far distances.
USC Shrine
I actually love the people who park in the Shrine, or at least my three best friends who park in this structure. Like the McCarthy Way folks, two words that make your world spin are “Event Parking.” You’re aware of your surroundings and assert yourself when the situation is right, like the blaring alarm that goes off when exiting the lot.
USC Village
If you’re not getting parking validation at some store in the Village, someone is giving false emotional validation.
There are plenty of other options that you can take into consideration — if you park on the street, you’re on another level. Even the incredible singer, songwriter and all-around icon Olivia Rodrigo can’t parallel park, so you got that going for you.
Regardless, as long as you find solace when you hop in your ride before traveling home, you can have whatever personality you want.
Drive safe, Besties.

On Aug. 1, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a State of Emergency for monkeypox. Many say that the situation doesn’t warrant an emergency, as to them it’s not severe. With deaths few and far between and less than 3,500 cases statewide as of Aug. 26, what’s there to worry about?
Newsom is making an emergency out of one that’s not there, they may say. But, being the contrarian politician-antagonist that I am, I would argue that the state is actually not doing enough to combat monkeypox.
If performance was solely based on lip service, they would be outstanding. Newsom stated when he declared the state of emergency that, “California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing … to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach … We’ll continue to work with the federal government … and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization.”
This sounds great in theory, but what steps are actually being taken?
Not much, as the state of emergency does not have enough real action behind it, and a lot still is left to be done. Vaccines are still limited and difficult to obtain, with specific sexual criteria required to get a single dose, let alone the following second booster. The eligibility begins and ends with being a gay/bisexual man or a transgender person who has had either (1) sex with multiple/anonymous people in the past two weeks or (2) intimate contact with people at large events in the past two weeks, alongside anyone who has engaged in commercial or transactional sex in the past two weeks.
Alongside the narrow criteria, a lack of education when it comes to monkeypox is worrying — many continue to compare it to or portray it as an sexually transmitted disease when it is far from the case. Monkeypox can still be spread through skin-to-skin contact and touching objects such as towels, bedding, clothing or even surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that it is not a STD, but rather one transmitted through close contact, it has continued to be stigmatized and seen as one. With this, those who think monkeypox spreads strictly via sex may not take the necessary precautions to prevent its spread.
Most worryingly, there is still much unknown about the virus, such as whether asymptomatic people can spread it, and yet, no measures have been taken to curb its possible spread. To make matters worse, testing is only done on open lesions, thus data for monkeypox cases has several caveats. Cases are likely underreported and testing exclusively on open lesions represents only severe cases and fails to consider moderate or asymptomatic cases. It is within the realm of possibility that there is a wholly undetected spread of less severe monkeypox -— one without visible lesions — in non-queer communities, yet the way the media presents the virus continues to make it seem like gay sex is the only way it can be spread.
From this limited portrayal of monkeypox, homophobic stigma surrounds the virus in a way not dissimilar to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. In an interview with Bloomberg, Stephen Thomas, director of the Center for Health Equity at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health, said, “If monkeypox is totally framed as an LGBTQ issue, then those individuals who do not see themselves part of the LGBTQ cultural community will not hear the message.”
Positioning monkeypox as a disease limited to gay men also does serve the state. In the same way public panic about the coronavirus was assuaged by positioning it as a disease for elderly folks — spoiler alert: Many younger people who have caught the disease now continue to face long-term effects — monkeypox’s depiction as a gay man’s disease may be used to quell further public panic, especially as there already is another ongoing disease to worry about.
Long story short, we’re living with three diseases running rampant: the coronavirus, monkeypox and Governor Newsom’s sickening failure of California residents. By simply declaring a state of emergency but not following it with adequate action, such as combatting the stigmatization and the stereotyping of the disease through educational campaigns, providing more funding for monkeypox research, having a detailed, proactive plan to curb the spread of the disease and especially, distributing vaccines to Californians more effectively, it almost feels as though we will make the same mistakes with the coronavirus pandemic whose spread still hasn’t ceased.
This is not to say that the emergence of cases should warrant panic or mass hysteria, but rather that our government should attend to it before it snowballs into something that does warrant a stronger reaction. Without the necessary actions, what can be a few sporadic cases can quickly turn into an epidemic — a lesson I thought we all learned after the past two years. How many times must we be taught our lesson before we learn from it?

Utah vs. Florida. Oregon vs. Georgia. There’s an appreciable irony in two of the three Pac-12 title contenders facing out-of-conference powerhouses on opening weekend. 
The Pac-12 was dragged through the mud all summer, with critics endlessly discussing how bleak their financial situation looked and prophesying their impending irrelevancy. Now, in the very first week, the Pac-12’s most impressive teams (which did not undergo realignment) will have a chance to make a statement to the nation in prime time. 
In the words of Utes head coach Kyle Whittingham, “It’s important for the Pac-12 to make noise on the national scene whenever we get opportunities like that…we have to make the most of it. If you want to gain respect, gain national attention, you got to come out and win some of those games.”
Unfortunately for Pac-12 fans or those who hate the SEC, Utah and Oregon face uphill battles.
Utah will enter the Swamp nine months after falling to Ohio State 48-45 in a very memorable Rose Bowl. Besides last year’s Ohio State team, Florida is the toughest opponent Utah has faced since joining the Pac-12 a decade ago. Nonetheless, the Utes have a solid chance here.
Utah really found their stride last season when redshirt junior quarterback Cameron Rising began to start under center week 4. Since then, they haven’t looked back, winning nine out of their 10 final games. Florida has been trending in the opposite direction, going 4-3 in the final seven games of last season. Utah kept nine starters in a lethal offense that put up more than 3,000 yards rushing and passing in 2021.
Despite these trends from last season, I don’t want to downplay how different these teams are coming into this season. Florida added seven transfers and had the 18th best transfer ranking in the nation. Utah also added a ton of new faces on defense, including Gators linebacker Mohamoud Diabate. This should be a close one, but I have Utah escaping the Swamp with a historic win. 
The Big Ten currently has 16 teams and are not racing to get more, but if Utah has an impressive season, starting with a prime-time win at Florida; it would be impossible for Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren to ignore. Adding the Utes would also put the Big Ten in all four time zones.
Oregon will travel to play the reigning champions, Georgia. On its face, this should be an easy win for the Bulldogs, but Oregon has an ace up its sleeve — their head coach, Dan Lanning, was the defensive coordinator for Georgia. Lanning knows the ins and outs of the formidable Georgia defense, which should keep the game closer than expected. 
Despite his expertise, Oregon players will not adapt to the speed and tenacity of Georgia. The Bulldogs should pull off the win at home as they look to repeat their championship run. 
Yet, if both Pac-12 teams return to the West Coast with victories, it would completely reframe the narrative about the Pac-12. The once-proclaimed-dead conference would show signs of life once again. This is an exciting, but admittedly unlikely, potential outcome. 
USC is in a very different situation from Utah and Oregon. The Trojans are facing a Rice team that can’t handle them on either side of the ball. 
Given Rice has the 108th best defense and 97th best offense in college football, it is not surprising that USC enters as a favorite. A blowout win would be a great start to the Lincoln Riley era and would allow them to start a pivotal season in a rhythm. 
However, one of the issues with high expectations — a 34.5 spread in the Trojans’ favor — is that there is not much room to exceed them. 
USC’s defensive line has not made significant progress this summer, and one of Rice’s notable bright spots is their passing game. 
With redshirt junior quarterback Wiley Green at the helm and talented transfer Sam Crawford at receiver, it would not be shocking if Rice can keep the game closer than expected.
Make no mistake, USC will win this game, but it will be an awful look for the revamped Trojans and their playoff aspirations if Rice keeps it interesting. 
Hopefully, USC can hit its stride early and signal a new era of Trojan football with an unassailable win.

The 2022-2023 NFL season is just around the corner, and numerous former Trojans are ready to make an impact to their respective teams this year. USC lays claim to some of the best wide receivers in the NFL today and ranks top 15 among colleges with the most active NFL players.While there are many breakout candidates up for discussion, here are a few former USC names to keep an eye on for the upcoming season.
Wide Receiver Michael Pittman Jr., Indianapolis ColtsIn just his second season in the NFL, Pittman established himself as one of the top young receivers in the league last year. Standing at 6-foot-4, Pittman had over 1,000 yards receiving, 6 touchdowns and finished in the league’s top 20 in receptions with 88. Pittman also recorded multiple games with over 100 yards receiving and averaged a remarkable 12.3 yards per catch. As the number one receiving option on a playoff-contending team in the Indianapolis Colts, Pittman is expected to be an integral part of the Colts’ offense and continues to stand out among young wide receivers. Pittman will also work with newly acquired quarterback Matt Ryan — who finished with almost 4,000 passing yards in 2021, and whose veteran experience, many believe, will help the Colts’ passing game.
Wide Receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit LionsDespite being drafted in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft, wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown proved himself as one of the elite rookie receivers in a stacked receiver class last year. Competing with notable names such as Ja’Marar Chase and Jaylen Waddle, St. Brown finished in the top five in receiving yards (912) and second in receptions (90) among rookies – recording two monster games of 111 and 109 receiving yards to end the season. As Lions rookie receiver Jameson Williams continues to recover from an ACL injury suffered last season at Alabama, St. Brown will see plenty of targets from quarterback Jared Goff to start the season. St. Brown is poised to build off his impressive rookie season with even better numbers on an improving Lions team.
Offensive Guard Alijah Vera-Tucker, New York JetsUnfortunate news struck Jets fans when lineman Mekhi Becton suffered a likely season-ending injury during training camp. However, this allows second-year offensive guard Alijah Vera-Tucker to pick up some of the load in the upcoming season. Drafted 14th overall in the 2021 draft, Vera-Tucker played 16 out of 17 games with the Jets last season and will likely have a similar workload this coming season, barring injury. A Morris Trophy recipient in 2020 and a two-time all-Pac-12 selection, Vera-Tucker showed promise as a college standout and emerged as a reliable starter for the Jets last season. While linemen are not usually in the limelight in terms of offense, they prove extremely valuable for an effective rushing attack and keeping the quarterback protected. Vera-Tucker will receive the task of defending young quarterback Zach Wilson, who is recovering from an injury of his own and is expected to be one of the anchors for the Jets’ offense in 2022.
Wide Receiver Drake London, Atlanta FalconsFor anyone who watched USC football in 2021, it’s not surprising that 6-foot-45 receiver Drake London is on this list. Leading the conference in receiving yards with 1,084 and receptions with 88, London won Pac-12 offensive player of the year in 2021, despite missing a third of the season due to an ankle injury. London will be an instant offensive spark for the Falcons in 2022. Atlanta, most likely, will not be seeing themselves in the 2022 NFL playoffs, with star wide receiver Calvin Ridley out for the season due to suspension and the downgrade at quarterback. However, London will still see quality playing time as a top receiving option for the Falcons alongside tight -end Kyle Pitts. And when healthy, London’s blend of size and agility makes him a dangerous receiver and he will be among the favorites for offensive rookie of the year. However, London’s durability remains doubtful after suffering an injury on the opening drive of the Falcons’ first preseason game.
Honorable MentionsJuJu Smith-Schuster, (Wide receiver, Kansas City Chiefs): Smith-Schuster looks to rebound with the Kansas City Chiefs after missing most of 2021 with a dislocated shoulder. The former USC star also recently suffered a knee injury in the preseason, but is expected to make a full recovery. He will see a significant upgrade at the quarterback position, replacing retired Ben Roethlisberger with gunslinger Patrick Mahomes.
Robert Woods (Wide receiver, Tennessee Titans): Woods is also looking for a fresh start in 2022 after missing the 2021 season with a torn ACL. Woods was traded to the Tennessee Titans and will likely be the primary receiving option for the team after trading A.J. Brown and releasing Julio Jones.
Uchenna Nwosu (Linebacker, Seattle Seahawks): Former Charger Uchenna Nwosu will now wear the blue and green after signing a two-year, $20 million contract with the Seattle Seahawks. In 2021, Nwosu had a career high of 40 total tackles, along with 2 forced fumbles and an interception and looks to build off those numbers in 2022.
