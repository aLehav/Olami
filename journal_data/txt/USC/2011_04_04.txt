Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story stated  William Watson had been named the Senior Vice President of Health.  Watson has actually been named the Vice President for Health  Sciences campus development. The university is still searching for the Senior Vice President of Health. A story on the search can be read here.

Because of the initial error, the original story mischaracterized Watson’s new position. A new story on Watson’s role can be read here.

The article  stated Watson would  be overseeing functions at the Health Sciences Campus. In fact, his role  will be to oversee development functions. Additionally, the article  said Watson would chair the Medical Enterprise Oversight Committee and  that the chief executive officer of USC Hospitals would report to him.  Both of these facts are incorrect. The initial report also incorrectly indicated Watson would report directly to President C. L. Max Nikias. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.
William Watson has officially been chosen as the vice president for Health Sciences Campus Development to oversee development functions at the University Hospital, the Keck School of Medicine and the Norris Cancer Hospital.
Watson will report directly to Al Checcio, senior vice president for University advancement, and will work closely with Provost Elizabeth Garrett and Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito.
Watson previously worked at Keck’s development office before moving to the Saint John’s Health Center and John Wayne Cancer Institute.
“I am delighted Bill Watson has returned to USC and joined our team,” Checcio said in a press release. “Having such a talented fundraiser and manager overseeing our efforts gives us a tremendous advantage at this stage of our campaign planning.”
Watson’s job will not stop at overseeing development functions at various university institutions, however. He will also work to collaborate with leaders at other USC health schools and bringing their diverse fundraising interests together.
“I’ll be working with the school of pharmacy, dentistry, occupational therapy and physical therapy,” Watson said. “Many times faculty of those places have overlapping interests.”
When Watson was the chief development officer at USC’s Keck School of Medicine, he raised money for the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research and the Keck School.
At Saint John’s, Watson helped raise $300 million for a new treatment center.
Watson said he grew up hating USC because of his family’s sports allegiances and was embarrassed to tell his friends he worked for Norris Cancer center in 1988. Watson has since had a change of heart.
“Being a Trojan gets in your blood,” Watson said as he held up a mug that read ‘Once a Trojan, always a Trojan.’ “I worked with Nikias before, so I’m excited to work with him.”
Watson said he is happy to return to the Trojan family.
“I’m excited to be back at USC,” Watson said. “The university has taken great strides in the past few years to advance the mission of the Health Sciences campus, and I’m eager to address the challenge of taking USC’s recent success even further.”
Dennis Jenkins, a graduate student studying public health, said he remembers hearing  about Watson’s fundraising work around USC before he left to work in Santa Monica.
“To hear a name being tossed around at such a huge university, I’d say that proves he’s done some great things in the past,” Jenkins said.
So basically this article was initially completely wrong? Shocking.

USC broke ground on the v on Tuesday.
The $15 million health center will open in spring 2013 on the north side of campus along Jefferson Boulevard, near Fluor Tower, and will reflect USC’s traditional architecture with a greco-roman style.
Digging · Several administrators, including President C. L. Max Nikias, attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the new health center. - Photo courtesy of Joel Zink 
President C. L. Max Nikias said the five-story, 101,000-square foot center will have space for specialized health practitioners, not just general physicians, and will be able to serve an increasingly residential campus.
“We need an institution that is worthy of our world-class university,” Nikias said at the groundbreaking ceremony.
Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, said a new health center has been needed for approximately 15 years; the current one opened in 1951.
“[This] immense gift will enhance the health and wellness of our current students, our staff and faculty and our future Trojans for decades to come,” Neinstein said.
Michele Engemann, a 1968 graduate of the School of Theatre alumna and daughter of baseball coach Rod Dedeaux, said she recalls using the current health center when she was a student at USC.
“I have friends who have grandchildren that go here,” Engemann said at the groundbreaking ceremony. “We are now into our third generation of students using that same facility. Roger and I have a keen understanding that this [new] building is needed and needed now, especially as USC becomes a more residential university and expects the health needs of students, grad students and faculty living and working in our campus community.”
Former Undergraduate Student Government President Chris Cheng said development of a new health center was one of students’ primary requests during his campaign for office last year.
“You truly couldn’t have picked a more significant issue to address the needs of the USC student body,” Cheng said at the groundbreaking ceremony. “Undergraduates spend a lot of time together in very, very, very close-quartered living spaces … The spirit of that community builds life-long relationships, but can also foster influenza.”
Natalie Morin, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, said the current health center’s physical structure undermines its credibility.
“The Health Center is so … small that I don’t feel like I’m going to get the care I need,” Morin said. “It’s not because of the doctors or the staff, but because the building is just so small and dated.”
I think you may be mistaken that the building is only $15 million. I’m pretty sure that the $15 million accounts for the name rights, not the entire building. There’s no way a building of 100,000 square feet is that little money unless it’s made out of cardboard and glue.
15  million was for name rights!
What is the ‘v’ that we broke ground on?
Also, wasn’t ground breaking on Monday April 4th, not Tuesday?
Good news… hope the recovery comes fast and strong. Our company is just barely hanging on and has depleted most of the cash reserves we have been operating on the last couple of years because We cannot find qualified people with degree, if you need a degree i would strongly recommend check out “High Speed University” for any one looking to get a professional degre

More than 80 students gathered around Tommy Trojan on Monday as part of the USC Walkout for a Safer Campus, voicing their concern about sexual violence at USC in the wake of the obscene email that circulated in early March.
Rally · More than 80 students participated in the USC Walkout for a Safer Campus on Monday. The students carried signs with various messages denouncing sexism and racism. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan 
The walkout was organized by the Coalition for a Safer Campus and Community, a group of students who came together in response to the issues raised in the Kappa Sigma email, and included representatives from Men Care, USC College Democrats and USC Women’s Student Assembly, among other organizations.
The walkout not only addressed the Kappa Sigma email which has made national headlines because of its offensive content, and the administrative response, which some students feel was insufficient, but also aimed to raise awareness of what organizers called a sexually abusive atmosphere women are pressured to join while they attend USC.
The walkout, which lasted from about 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., began with participants circling Tommy Trojan and chanting, “One, two, three, four, we won’t take it anymore, five, six, seven, eight, end the violence, end the hate,” and, “our bodies, our lives, our campus, our rights.”
Participants also held signs reading “we demand a rape-free campus” and, “safety first, image second.”
Everett Jellinek, a senior majoring in mathematics and East Asian languages and cultures, attended the walkout because of his outrage toward the Kappa Sigma email. He said he wanted to show not all men behave in the manner described in the email.
“I was horrified by the Kappa Sigma email,” Jellinek said. “There are [more respectful] guys out there.”
At the walkout, USC College Democrats offered participants the opportunity to get their pictures taken with various signs including one that read, “I [heart] women’s health.”
Ximena Velázquez-Arenas, vice president of USC College Democrats, said it is important for students to be conscious of their rights and to vocalize when they are being restricted.
“When it comes to your rights, you have to keep a constant watch on them otherwise they can vanish quickly,” Velázquez-Arenas said.
After about an hour of chanting, participants assembled in front of Tommy Trojan for an open mic and were encouraged to express their opinions about the Kappa Sigma email and the social atmosphere at USC.
Speakers at the open mic included both professors and students. Emilia Ana Cosma, director of the USC Women’s Student Assembly, spoke about the importance of the Trojan Family in responding to sexual violence on campus.
“As a member of the Trojan Family, you are all my family,” Cosma said. “An attack on one of you is an attack on my family.”
Heather Larabee, assistant dean of students and director of Campus Activities who was present at the walkout to ensure the event went in accordance with organizers’ plans, said the administration is still investigating the Kappa Sigma email and that overall campus safety is the larger issue.
Members of the National Lawyers Guild, including several USC graduate students at USC, were also present at the walkout to protect the students from possible interference by the administration, according to Míchel Angela Martinez, a graduate student studying political science and a legal worker member of the National Lawyer Guild’s Los Angeles Chapter.
“It is important that the National Lawyers Guild attend protests like the walkout because students are not necessarily aware of their rights,” Martinez said. “The administration has been hostile with protestors in the past and we [were] here to make sure the administration remained hospitable.”
Also present was James Lafferty, the executive director of the National Lawyers Guild Los Angeles Chapter.
Marissa Honda, a senior majoring in music, said she participated in the walkout because she believes the Kappa Sigma email does not represent the views of just one individual.
“It is important that regardless of what change occurs, that there is always a group of people who think the email was not just one guy being funny, but a culture that needs to be changed,” Honda said.
Alicia Lu, a senior majoring in sociology and neuroscience who organized the walkout, was very satisfied with the turnout and the energy of the participants.
“This was by far the biggest demonstration I have seen at USC,” Lu said. “People who wanted to make change were here; we are energized.”
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, said in an email that USC officials stand by students and faculty in denouncing the content of the email.
“USC’s principles of community clearly state that, while a scholarly community must acknowledge the value of free expression, we will not allow instances of prejudice and discrimination to go unchallenged,” Jackson said.
 
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Jane Lafferty was the executive director of the National Lawyers Guild Los Angeles Chapter. His name is actually James Lafferty. The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
what ever happened regarding the e-mail? who actually sent it? please tell me they received severe disciplinary action.
One might say that the walkout protest demanding a rape-free campus from the Administration is scarier than the offensive email.
The email was a crass and a terrible attempt at humor, nothing that anyone is defending, but these protesters are delusional and unrealistic – and they think they’re the only people that care about women because they scream about how horrified they are and how someone should do something about it.
The group of 80 protesters is really the culture at ‘SC that needs to be changed.
Suni Ellis
I’m not sure if 80 people qualifies as a “culture”. Maybe a “subculture”, if you really want to stretch the definition. 
The fact that our demand for a rape-free campus is seen as “unrealistic” reveals exactly how entrenched the culture of misogyny really is at USC. The protest may have included a petition to the Administration for more stringent policies on sexual harassment and sexual assault, but its location in the center of campus was intended also to raise awareness about the underlying culture that perpetuates these heinous acts.
We should not be criticized as “delusional” for expressing our heartfelt views. The email was not merely an “attempt at humor” — it was forwarded around with the subject line “Funny Kappa Sig email”. Students found it funny. The most straightforward interpretation of that viewpoint is that misogyny, racism, and rape jokes are casually accepted at USC. Am I offended because the email says that I’m not a real person? You bet I am. That’s why I shouted about it.
And if you care, just tell us what you are doing? Who are you to condemn them?
Everyone is being so dramatic. If those 80 people feel so threatened by a single email, I think we have a bigger problem than just a sexual environment here at USC. I am a girl and have never felt “unsafe” because of it. I think it is a little ridiculous to stage a protest demanding something that the university has little control over. What do they expect to come out of this protest? That is my biggest question.
How about action? How about transparency regarding who sent the email and disciplinary action?
People being threatened by that email is definitely NOT worse than the sexual environment, part of which apparently accepted that awful, immature email as a joke. Was the email just some douchebag’s moronic attempt at humor? Yeah, probably. But that doesn’t make it not scary. It’s better that people are staging a protest and saying that the statements in the email are not acceptable as opposed to saying nothing at all. Would you prefer if everyone let it slide? What kind of negative attitudes could that pave the way for?
Also, just because you personally have never felt unsafe in the sexual environment here, doesn’t mean that others haven’t. It’s unreasonable for you to use your own personal experience as a basis for how other girls, and some guys I guess, should feel.
As for what they expect to come out of the protest? Probably just raised awareness and the knowledge that there is vocal opposition to the attitude presented in the email. The protest was a small group of people and may have had only 80  at any given time, but they also serve as allies to people who disagreed with the email, but kept quiet about it.
And you know what? When it comes down to responding to that email, better dramatic than apathetic.
Jim. 
*Jim* Lafferty is the Executive Director of the LA NLG Chapter.
This is a joke right?  80 people?  We get 80 people at the drop of hat to show for one of parties that we don’t even let in.   Maybe this is the same group?
News articles about protest marches always exaggerate the head count. It was probably closer to 40-50 people.
As one of the legal observers–in addition to rights protection we are charged with taking stock of the environment, watching people-flows, etc.–I thought I would share that *our* count was closer to 200 individuals over the course of the protest, march, and speak-out, with roughly 80 people present at any one moment.
Comments like yours are the reason why Greek has the negative douchey image it does…
I’ll make sure you never get past the velvet rope GDI.
Velvet rope? It’s a frat party, not a celebrity event. Don’t think too highly of yourself…
Last time I checked, fraternities were totally cool with letting GDI women (“targets” is the term you misguidedly use, I believe) into their parties. 
I just don’t understand: why can’t guys come to the parties? Obviously, fraternity gentlemen are so charming and attractive that no GDI guy could possibly compete for the available women. 
Also — don’t bother telling me you’ll keep me out of your party, or that I got cut hard last fall. I’m a woman.
Only gentlemen from Fraternities tell other guys to bring back 10 girls as an admission ticket… as if they were currency… classy.
Yeah, it was a pretty small protest. What’s your point?
[…] While we are certain that the distinction between online and offline experience is no longer useful to describe most of our lived experience of self or community, in our many conversations about place, activism, self-authoring and self-representation, I have always held the protest up as a sort of litmus test of embodiment. Given that the vast majority of my students had never been in (or witnessed) a protest, the sustaining  gap between (my) lived, bodily experience and (their) experience via representation would then function in our classroom to authorize and alienate, albeit kindly. That is, until they voted to walk out. […]

In the typical Britney Spears fashion, the pop princess  returns with a bang with her Femme Fatale tour, beginning June 17 in Sacramento, Calif. and ending August 13 in the same city.
Recently, there has been a lot of talk about Enrique Iglesias opening for the iconic pop-star, but this claim was rejected as Iglesias announced on WhoSay.com, “Hey guys, sorry for the confusion regarding a possible tour in the summer with Britney Spears.  We are on the Euphoria Tour and will continue to do so including some soon-to-be-announced dates in US. So hope to see all of you soon.”  Such a pity.   
 But TMZ has mentioned the possibility of Nicki Minaj stepping in as an opening act, allotting the possibility of a full-blown, female tour de force.  There has also been talk about Joe Jonas replacing the sexy Latin star (yes that means a Jonas brother would be off on his own).  The rumor has yet to be confirmed, but according to Zap2It, the chances are pretty good given that Jonas is currently working on a dance-infused solo project that fits Spears’ upbeat persona.  
In addition, DJ Pauly D recently performed in Las Vegas with Ms. Spears herself for her MTV special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale. The pair share a common manager, Larry Rudolph, so the chances of them teaming up are good provided that the timing works out with filming for Jersey Shore Season 4.  
Spears has yet to confirm any of the rumors. She has, however, discussed her desire to perform with Usher, which would create a quality pop duo indeed.  With the tour rapidly approaching, results should be in soon.  
Who would you like to see open for the Queen of Pop?

Every college football season for the past 10 years has featured a thunderstorm of complaints about everybody’s favorite whipping boy, the Bowl Championship Series.
When fans, coaches and sports writers complain about the lack of a playoff system in college football, they immediately point to March Madness as the gold standard for determining a true national champion and giving us a heck of a ride along the way.
To put it in Twitter speak: March Madness > BCS.
Or at least, that was the consensus before this March.
The particular wackiness of this year’s March Madness has caused some to claim college basketball is susceptible to the same disease as the BCS, only in reverse.  
Instead of letting the regular season largely determine a national title, March Madness weighs in postseason play too heavily, allowing subpar teams like Butler and Connecticut to get hot at the right time.
Was UConn really the best team in the country this year? Does it deserve to be called the national champion?
I’m appalled the debate even exists. First of all, what is the definition of a “true” national champion?
If Kansas, Ohio State or any other top-seed were deserving of the crown, then they would not have lost. A championship team is the team that’s best when it counts the most.
Just because UConn finished ninth in the Big East doesn’t mean it is not the best team in college basketball. What it accomplished this season should not be diminished because it took the players until the Big East Tournament to kick it into high gear.
Same goes for Butler. Yes, it was a No. 8 seed in the tournament with some ugly losses this season (Evansville and Youngstown State among them). But until yesterday, it hadn’t lost on the biggest stage, and it came through at (almost) all the right times.
The other problem with the debate is it assumes football and basketball are more comparable than they are. A good basketball team can easily lose to an inferior opponent. There are more games, less time to prepare for each opponent and nights when the shots just don’t fall.
On the other hand, in football, a team has at least a week to get ready for each opponent. Upsets are also much less likely because of the physical nature of the game. A team isn’t going to lose four or five games to inferior teams.
But in basketball, upsets are much more reasonable.
The whole point is to make it to March, because that’s when anything can happen. People should be applauding the Butler-UConn final because it represents everything that is right in college basketball, while football continues to wrong us year after year.
During this ridiculous debate, I don’t hear anybody calling for a change to the NFL playoff system.
Didn’t the sixth-seeded New York Giants beat the undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII? Wasn’t this year’s champion, the Green Bay Packers, also a sixth seed?
To suggest UConn is not the real national champion is ludicrous.
Championship teams thrive in March, or January or whenever the postseason starts. It doesn’t matter if it took them until that month to come alive.
You say this makes the college basketball regular season less meaningful? I say, who cares? If it leads to an entire month of mayhem in March and an open field is consistent with the fairness of competition, then I can live with that.
All sports, especially sports with longer seasons like basketball, allow teams to develop incrementally over the course of the year. There might be a lot of ups and downs, but what matters is the finished product.
And I’ve never bought the argument the college football regular season would be less meaningful without the BCS. There are only 12 or 13 games. If teams were fighting for only eight playoff positions, the regular season would hardly lack meaning.
The college basketball champion is always deserving of its crown because it survived a true playoff.
The college football champion often isn’t, because it can hide behind weak schedules and partial voters to get into the title game.
Even USC’s last two football championships are tainted because of the broken system.
The 2003 championship was a split title with LSU and in 2004, Auburn finished undefeated but was left out of the Orange Bowl. USC got to roll over a severely outmatched Oklahoma team instead.
A true champion can say it took on all challengers and emerged victorious. A true champion is the best team at the end of the season, not the beginning or middle.
In other words, a true champion is the last man standing after the dust clears in a field that started with 68 competitors, 67 of whom just didn’t have what it takes.

It’s never easy to face a former team, and perhaps even harder as a coach.
USC baseball takes on Loyola Marymount at 3 p.m. today at Dedeaux Field. USC interim coach Frank Cruz was the coach of the Lions (16-10) for 12 seasons from 1997 to 2008, racking up 329 wins, three WCC titles and three NCAA tournament appearances. Today, he’ll face them as the head coach of the Trojans (10-18).
One more time · After allowing six runs Saturday, starter Austin Wood, pictured in a 5-2 win over Cal Poly, could see time on the hill today. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Both sides come in struggling. Loyola Marymount started off the season 7-1, but has since posted a .500 record. The Trojans are worse off, having gone 2-8 in their last 10 games.
“Everything is there,” said USC pitching coach Tom House. “We know we can pitch, we know we can hit. It’s all there. The only thing that’s missing is the result.”
Indeed, the Trojans have shown they can play with any team in the country.
They put up 14 runs in three games last weekend against a California pitching staff that had a season ERA below 2.00. But USC surrendered 28 runs and lost two of three to the No. 13 team in the nation.
It’s pitching, however, that has kept the Trojans in games this season, holding opponents to five runs or less in 18 of their 28 games.
Yet it seems whenever the pitching is there, the hitting isn’t, and vice-versa.
“We’ve been at extremes,” House said. “But the law of averages says we’ll even out. Eventually we’ll put the two performances together.”
It will take that type of performance for the Trojans to get back on track for the rest of the year, as they navigate one of the most difficult schedules in the nation.
The Pac-10 boasts six ranked teams this week, and eight Pac-10 teams have been ranked at some point.
And the team’s midweek games, such as today against the Lions, don’t exactly help.
As it stands now, none of the Trojans’ midweek opponents has a sub-.500 record.
“We’ve gotta be right up there within terms of toughest schedules,” House said.
For USC, that means grinding through and doing what it can.
Saturday starter Austin Wood got knocked out in the first inning this weekend, throwing just 19 pitches.
But that just means the former fourth-round draft pick with electric stuff could be used on the hill today.
“We’re trying to take a positive out of everything,” House said. “And we’re not playing terrible baseball right now. We know if we stick with the process the results will come.”

It is an iconic movie scene for any sports fan. The star of The Natural, Roy Hobbs, steps to the plate wielding his famous bat “Wonderboy” that he’s used since high school. Hobbs hits a long foul ball. As he jogs back to the plate, he notices “Wonderboy” has split in two. Hobbs hesitates, stunned.
Discovering his swing · Since switching to a 35-inch, 32-ounce bat earlier this month, junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa has gone on a tear at the plate, hitting .426 with five home runs and 22 RBIs. His .364 average leads the Trojans. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Think it’s a bit overdramatized? It’s not.
Any baseball player will tell you their most cherished piece of equipment is their glove, but bats are a close second. Just ask USC junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa. As Oropesa tells it, he can “pick up a bat and just know.”
But as of March 8, Oropesa, who is sixth on USC’s all-time home run list with 38 long balls and was named a 2011 preseason first-team All-American, was hitting just .250. He had yet to hit a home run, had recorded five RBIs and had struck out nine times.
Oropesa is not one to make excuses, but he had one.
He didn’t have his bat. Or, more specifically, he wasn’t allowed to use it.
 
At all levels of amateur baseball, players use metal bats, which are considered safer and more durable than wood because they do not break and splinter.
From a hitting perspective, metal is considered superior because the bat actually compresses on impact, causing the ball to “shoot” off much faster than it does off wood. Additionally, metal bats are not subject to the variations of natural wood, where certain parts of the bat simply hit the ball harder than others, giving a larger “sweet spot” that extends across most of the barrel.
When metal bats were first introduced to college baseball in 1974, batting averages jumped eight points. After 11 years, averages were up 40 points.
To combat rising batting averages and home run tallies, the NCAA has twice limited the length-to-weight ratio of a bat. In 1986, it was minus-5, then in 1997 was reduced to minus-3, meaning a bat could not be more than three inches longer than its weight in ounces.
Each time, stats quickly decreased, only to climb back to previous levels. Pitchers also became increasingly endangered by the speed at which balls were hit back at them, often in excess of 100 miles per hour.
In 2008, the NCAA announced it was revolutionizing the way it regulated bats by limiting the amount of power using the Ball-Bat Coefficient of Restitution, which measures rebound-ratio of a ball bouncing off the bat.
“The new BBCOR formula provides a better measure of the bat’s performance and therefore allows the rules committee and bat testing laboratories to better predict field performance based on lab tests,” the NCAA said in a statement. “The goal is that non-wood bats that meet this new standard will perform similarly to wood bats.”
The NCAA set the limit for the BBCOR at 0.50, which is roughly the same as the best wooden bats. Almost none of the metal bats used at the time matched the limitation, and certainly none used at the collegiate level. As a result, bat companies had to go through a lengthy certification process that cost upward of $10,000. Most college players use a 33-inch, 30-ounce bat, although some prefer bats an inch and an ounce shorter or longer.
But Ricky Oropesa’s bat of choice is 35 inches long and weighs 32 ounces, and as the only player who uses that size, it is rare a bat company would choose to certify a 35-inch bat.
Oropesa, as a result, was forced to start the season using a 34-inch, 31-ounce bat. That difference might not sound like much, but for a player like Oropesa it was significant.
“It was like I had a twig in my hand,” Oropesa said of the smaller bat. “I was so uncomfortable, so unconfident at the plate.”
After countless calls from the USC coaching staff, Nike did certify a 35-inch, 32-ounce bat. Oropesa got his new bat March 10, and the difference was clear.
Oropesa has hit .426 since, raising his average to a team-leading .364. His slugging percentage has risen from .386 to .582 and his on-base percentage from .313 to 426. He has added 22 RBIs and has hit five home runs in 16 games.
But that still doesn’t mean Oropesa is happy with the new BBCOR bats.
“Honestly I’d rather hit with wood,” the slugger said. “They perform the same and I just like them better.”
Though the new metal bats still have more “pop” than wood, the sweet spot has been reduced to that of a wood bat, forcing hitters to “square it up” and hit the ball with the sweet spot.
“It’s still metal,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “So it still hits harder than wood. It’s just harder to do than it was before.”

The picture of a typical family is usually a mom, dad and children who resemble them.
In A Family Portrait, however, USC students Melissa Leu and Jeff Haig paint a much different picture.
Say cheese · A Family Portrait followed the life of John and Alen and won a Remi awad from the Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival. - Photo courtesy of Melissa Leu 
The 15-minute documentary is centered around an atypical family composed of a gay couple raising two adopted young children of different races.
Yet as Leu, a senior majoring in print journalism, points out, “On the surface they may seem like a very unique family, but when you get to know them, they’re actually pretty traditional.”
Although it might seem unconventional at first glance, after watching the film, this family looks no different than any other.
John and Alen live a fairy-tale lifestyle. After falling in love and getting married, they raise two children by themselves. With one full-time working dad, one full-time stay-at-home dad and a house with a white picket fence, how much more traditional can you get?
“They are like a 1950s traditional family, just with a very unique family structure,” said Haig, a Ph.D. studying education.
What started as an assignment became an award-winning production.
Leu and Haig began work on the project in the Documentary Production class taught by professor Bill Yahraus. The assignment for the class was simply to make a short documentary.
With this prompt and a rough outline, Leu and Haig created a combination of a social issue piece and a heartwarming story.
Haig gives credit to the class, saying it added to the film’s strength.
The film was awarded Official Selection at seven different Film Festivals (and counting), and was granted the prestigious Remi Award at the 2011 Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival, the festival where directors like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were discovered.
Leu is in awe of the acclaim the film has received.
“I’m amazed by how much success we got with this film. We just wanted to make something that our friends could watch,” she said.
Despite all the publicity they have received and the controversial subject matter their film portrays, the filmmakers’ intention was simple.
“Our goal wasn’t to push any sort of agenda. It was to show people who might not normally be exposed that gay families exist,” Leu said. “We were just trying to tell a story.”
Leu and Haig take the audience into the life of a family they would never have had the chance to see before, creating a captivating story as well as a conversation starter.
“Although we never intended to push an agenda, the film will inevitably raise discussion about the issue [of gay rights and civil liberties],” Haig said.
But when watching the film, that issue fades into the background as the viewer follows the family members through their everyday lives. Leu and Haig were able to capture the family at its most natural.
“It was like we were wallflowers in their home,” Haig said. “This is them being themselves.”
In the end, the film is not about bringing up controversial issues or trying to start a movement.
“It doesn’t matter whether your gay, straight or somewhere in between, what makes a family is love, and I think everyone can agree on that,” Leu said.
Leu and Haig insist that production of this film was an enjoyable experience.
“We’re happy we ended up finding such an important message — that all you really need to have a family is love,” Haig said.

The guys behind the new upscale Italian eatery Sotto in West Los Angeles have quite a bit of pizza-producing experience — and it shows.
Both former chefs at the critically acclaimed Pizzeria Ortica in Orange County, Steve Samson and Zach Pollack have taken over the underground space that once housed Test Kitchen, a pop-up restaurant with constantly rotating chefs, and turned it into a source of more consistent cuisine.
Dimly lit by bulbs hanging above each reclaimed-wood table, the restaurant gives off a rustic, industrial vibe.
Molto bene · Sotto serves interesting pizzas from one of only a few ovens made by Stefan Ferrara, who hails from Naples. The dishes present authentic southern Italian flavors that go beyond standard Italian dishes. - Photo courtesy of Sotto Restaurant
Its vast collection of wines, displayed in a high-ceiling glass encasement, adds to the ambience.
Although much of the menu requires some explanation, the pizzas are fairly self-explanatory.
Perhaps the restaurant’s specialty, the pizzas are the perfect size to be shared by a pair, or even devoured by one very hungry eater.
Among Sotto’s pizza offerings are the more standard marinara and margherita, as well as a pie topped with pork cheek and scallions; one topped with lardo, sunchokes and fennel and another topped with the interesting but delicious combination of sausage, broccoli, mozzarella and chilies.
The crust is baked to perfection, remaining fluffy but not overly doughy, with the perfect amount of crispness.
To create the perfect pizza, Samson and Pollack enlisted third-generation oven-maker Stefano Ferrara, who hails from Naples, to construct the massive, hand-built Neapolitan pizza oven residing in the restaurant’s kitchen.
The oven, one of less than 10 Ferrara has built around the country, guarantees any of the five pizzas on the menu will be cooked to perfection.
Besides pizza, the menu contains an array of other Italian options waiting to be explored, though it lacks staples like fettucine and tortellini.
Though their names give little insight into what the dishes listed under the headings “Small,” “Medium,” “Large” and “Pasta” actually are, the waiters are extremely helpful, providing both descriptions and personal recommendations.
My waiter recommended pittule pugliese, the quality of which proved his good taste.
The fried balls of dough topped with vincotto, which translates to “cooked wine” and is a dark, dense grape juice, and ricotta cheese provide the perfect combination of savory with a hint of sweet.
These might even be enjoyed at the end of the meal, acting as a good segue into the cannoli and other Italian desserts.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves: The “Medium,” “Large” and “Pasta” offerings have yet to be explored.
Mustard green and finocchietto minestra, a soup that contains faro, Calabrian chilies, pecorino and egg, is a standout in the menu’s medium plates section, along with the grilled pork meatballs and Devil’s Gulch pig coratella.
Fennel-crusted pork chop, veal brisket á la Genovese and bone-in lamb breast in agrodolce are some of the larger options.
Much like the rest of the menu, the pasta selection is far from standard.
The maharrones de pungiu is similar in substance to gnocchi and is topped with a sugo semplice, which translates to “simple sauce” — marinara with a Sotto twist.
For those seeking something a little more adventurous in the pasta realm, there is also squid ink fusilli lunghi with pistachios, bottarga and mint and toasted grain capunti with ragu bianco, a white meat-based sauce, black trumpet mushrooms and rapini greens.
The food, which boasts surprisingly reasonable prices considering the high quality and taste infused in every bite, can be complemented by one of Sotto’s specialty cocktails or a glass of wine from its lengthy list of bottles from Southern Italy and California.
With its unique menu, Sotto seems to have no trouble attracting customers.
Even after 9 p.m. on Saturday night — granted it was the restaurant’s opening weekend — the restaurant was packed.
So grab a few friends, make a reservation and take your tastebuds on a trip to the southern tip of Italy.
 
Sotto is located on 9575 West Pico Blvd. in Los Angeles.

#$%&, @#$%, #$&* ! The uninhibited stream of four-letter words might be the best line in the Oscar-winning screenplay of The King’s Speech, not for its profane content, but for the raw emotion Best Actor winning Colin Firth puts behind it, portraying a Prince (and future King) of England letting down the wall of propriety that has separated him from the common folk.
But apparently The Weinstein Company, which holds all distribution rights to the film, does not agree.
Last Friday, the company released an edited, PG-13 version of The King’s Speech, hoping to cash in on the audience that might have missed the formerly R-rated film when it originally came out.
Originally, the F-word appeared 12 times in David Seidler’s screenplay about King George VI’s stuttering problem.
Seven of those 12 instances occur during the King’s rage-filled chain of expletives incited by his speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who notices the King doesn’t stammer when he curses.
But according to the MPAA ratings board, the F-word can only be used once in a PG-13 film.
Thus, this curse-laden scene is stripped of all its fabulous energy as Firth quietly utters the F-word once, and the rest of the words are awkwardly overdubbed with slightly milder invectives.
Last month, the MPAA granted the Weinstein Company a waiver to re-release the film without having to wait the required 90 days from when the R-rated version was pulled from theaters.
The company’s President of Theatrical Distribution and Home Entertainment, Erik Lomis, professed the company’s gratitude to the MPAA saying, “The action enables those to whom [the film] speaks most directly — young people who are troubled by stuttering, bullying and similar trials — to see it.”
This claim that The Weinstein Company was primarily motivated by helping the American youth is misleading at best.
When producers fight for a PG-13 rating, either in terms of censoring a film or arguing with the MPAA, it is generally understood to be for financial reasons. R-rated movies are often thought to suffer because they lose out on younger viewers.
The Weinstein Company is simply taking this common industry dilemma to a new level. The King’s Speech has already been wildly successful with its R rating, but the company is milking its Oscar darling for all it’s worth.
Even on a business level, though, the decision is still perplexing.
The King’s Speech is a wonderful film that should be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. But it’s not as if parents were expecting crude sex scenes or violence from the R-rated restrained British drama. Many probably had no problem bringing the kids along.
And it is extremely unlikely that even a PG-13 period piece about the British royal family will win over the coveted and lucrative Twilight demographic: 14-year-old girls eager to return to the theater over and over on their parents’ dime.
It might not seem like such a grave crime to censor a few words in a couple scenes, but The Weinstein Company’s unprecedented marketing move shows a willingness to compromise artistic integrity for profit. This is ironic, as Owen Gleiberman pointed out in Entertainment Weekly, considering Harvey Weinstein’s well-deserved reputation for creative quality.
Mere months ago, Weinstein personally defended a controversial sex scene in last December’s originally NC-17-rated Blue Valentine, convincing the MPAA to give it an R rating without censorship.
With The King’s Speech, though, the Weinsteins even disrespected the filmmakers in their quest for financial success.
Director Tom Hooper told Entertainment Weekly in January that he “wouldn’t support cutting the film in any way,” and he had no part in the re-editing process.
Likewise, Firth, Rush and Bonham Carter have all stated they don’t believe the film needed to be changed.
In one of the film’s final scenes, the newly crowned King prepares to deliver his eponymous speech to a country on the brink of war, and finds his stutter returning.
He uses a technique Logue taught him to ease the stammer, dropping a rapid succession of F-bombs and “buggers” into his practice recitation of the grave speech.
It is a moment laced with tension and suspense, perfectly punctuated with the humor of improper language.
Will replacing an F-word with an S-word really ruin a great film? Hopefully not. But it’s a shame The Weinstein Company’s fingerprints will be so unnecessarily visible on the screen.

The last time most of us heard from David Schwimmer, he was earning a seven-figure salary for the penultimate episodes of Friends, seemingly destined for a ritzy retirement.
Photo courtesy of Millenium Films
Now, Schwimmer has taken up residence behind the camera with Trust, a new film about online sexual predators and the devastation suffered by victims and their families. It is one of the most bruising films of the year and deserves to be seen by a wide audience.
Fourteen-year-old Annie Cameron (Liana Liberato) lives the life of an average middle-class Chicago teenager. She plays varsity volleyball, enjoys the company of two loving parents, Will and Lynn (Clive Owen and Catherine Keener), and wrestles with the desire to be accepted by her school’s in-crowd. She also has an online friend with whom she frequently chats — a hunky junior named Charlie who hails from California.
Realizing every MySpace generation parent’s worst nightmare, the two meet up at the local mall, where “Charlie” is revealed to be a 40-year-old man (Chris Henry Coffey).
Here’s the thing, though: At face value, Charlie is a long way from the emaciated pedophiles we’ve come to know on the evening news.
Boyish and full of flattery, he emotionally manipulates the uncertain Annie, until the two are in a dark motel room and it’s too late to run down the hall.
Here, Schwimmer does something extraordinary.
Instead of shoving our noses into the obscenity of rape, he trains his camera toward the floral walls of the room, and slowly disappears into a patch of blue flowers.
It’s the same trick Lars von Trier employed in Antichrist, when a murky vase of green stems spoke unspeakable horrors of nature.
In Schwimmer’s hands, those flowers seethe with the darkest implications of violation and memory repression.
The film’s strongest section is the aftermath of the act, where Will’s rage and obsession with catching Charlie and beating him to a pulp overshadow Annie’s own rehabilitation.
We realize Annie, faced with frequent grilling by a well-intentioned FBI agent (Jason Clarke), humiliation at school and nothing but stunned disbelief from her dad, might be more damaged by the fallout than by the rape itself.
Owen and Keener are astoundingly believable in their respective embodiments of anger and anguish.
It’s rare an onscreen couple exudes the familiar electricity of a real one.
The scenes of breakdown between Will and Lynn are authentic because we can sense the wisps of lost joy that once steered their lives.
Newcomer Liana Liberato is the star of the picture. In a performance of intelligence, grace and painful vulnerability, she is the cracked voice of reason and compassion in Trust, all too often drowned out by the screams of shock and indignation around her. Liberato’s unusually mature work here is a testament that often, the most effective performances come from those whose craft has not been tainted by years of steady preteen projects in Hollywood.
Still, even if Schwimmer’s picture is viscerally compelling, the question we must ask is, why subject ourselves to a work of such dark nature? Trust is an abrasive film, but a timely one.
Whereas The Social Network tracked the digital translation of relationships and the narcissism that came with them, Schwimmer, who has worked extensively with rape victims and their families, asks what comes next.
Internet purists live and die by the right to allow the web to go unpoliced, but doesn’t such a stance imply an inherent faith in personal responsibility? You have to wonder how the distribution of child pornography, or documents referring to women as “targets” and drawing an imaginary line between “rape” and “non-consent” would still flourish if we allowed ourselves to get over that ecstatic freedom of consummating our dreams though a machine.
As Trust grimly shows us, such consummation can destroy real people. That is the film’s flame, and the reason why its occasional moments of heavy-handedness — Will’s career as an American Apparel-esque advertising exec, an unnaturally tidy closing scene — can be overlooked. In the fashion of an artist and an activist, Mr. Schwimmer has shown us something that most of us will not want to see, but definitely need to.

Viral emails need attention
 
On March 8, several friends and I learned about what’s now known as the “Kappa Sigma email.”
We were appalled and frustrated by the administration’s decision to await Kappa Sigma’s own internal investigation before taking action.
Moreover, we were frustrated by what we see as a culture of misogyny, not just at USC, but nationwide.
The following morning, when I mentioned the email in my class, a female student asked if she was “wrong” for finding the email funny.
What could I possibly say? My fellow graduate students have similar stories emblematic of a culture that internalizes many of the ideas expressed in the email, and in response, the eight of us drafted a letter voicing our concerns, which is available online.
The university administration has thus far responded with its own open letter. I sincerely hope this dialogue continues, but the scope of my concern, and indeed the issue at hand, is much broader.
The email is central, but we must not become mired in details. We can argue whether enough is being done to identify the email’s author and those who distributed it, or if finding them is even possible.
But if they are found, what then? Have they committed a crime? Violated a code of conduct? Are they protected by the First Amendment? These are important questions but they can potentially distract us from the real problem: a culture of objectification and violence toward women. Focusing on scapegoats allows larger issues to remain ignored.
This is not an indictment of fraternity members, or USC specifically, but a reality of our contemporary culture.
When an individual claiming to represent a fraternity distributes this kind of email, it’s an outrage and possibly a punishable offense.
When Tucker Max advocates these same ideas, it’s accepted as entertainment. But we must not pass blame around until it fades altogether, or throw our hands up in despair.
We need to understand the cultural forces producing misogyny and violence in order to change them.
I hope the author is found, but if online comment threads are an indication, any number of young men could have composed the same email.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that this email has stirred up controversy, and I hope the administration seizes this opportunity for dialogue and education.
If this has taught us nothing else, it’s what we do and say here resonates beyond our campus; and we should use the national attention to turn the tide against misogyny and sexual violence at USC and in the culture at large.

The University policies don’t need to be changed or rewritten in any way. Nor does one need any legal experience to look up the current code of conduct for both graduate and undergraduate students. The code clearly states the kinds of views expressed in the Kappa Sig email are at best questionable and at worst reasons for dismissal from the university. I quote Section 11, Article 44:
“A. Engaging in disorderly conduct or lewd, indecent or obscene behavior in the university community or at university-sponsored activities.
B. Encouraging or permitting others to engage in misconduct prohibited within the university community. Failing to confront and prevent the misconduct, notify an appropriate university official of the misconduct, or remove oneself from the situation.”
And as a Writing 140 instructor it pains me to see, from several of these comments, that logical fallacies do indeed rule the day–particularly of the ad hominen variety. But as Stephen pointed out earlier, this completely misses the point. This is not a witch hunt for a particular student by any means, nor an attempt to silence intelligent and critical dialogue, but instead an opportunity to create a safer, more respectful environment on campus.
“This is not a witch hunt . . . nor an attempt to silence intelligent and critical dialogue, but instead an opportunity to create a safer, more respectful environment on campus.”
And how would this be achieved except by silencing someone or forcing them to change their beliefs about a subject? Nice job with the logical fallacies….
Are you suggesting that someone that endorses such an e-mail shouldn’t have his or her mind changed? Misogyny and racism are somehow legitimate, just other points of view? As if this dialogue should consist of people like Mr. Winningham vs. the misogynists? We shouldn’t apologize for taking a stance against prejudice just because it’s legally protected. This sort of language reflects and reproduces a culture that needs to be interrogated. Again, finding the guilty party is of little use. The problem is systemic and needs to be brought to the fore so that we don’t allow such forms of prejudice to pass as benign. The point is not to change an individual’s mind. It’s to help foster the conditions that would prevent the production of such an e-mail.
I’m still not clear on how anyone could read the e-mail as “sarcastic.” There’s no hint of irony in the e-mail.
What ‘actions’ can or should the University take, or any authoritative body for that matter?
Will University policy changes, SCAMPUS re-writings, and mandates to attend sexual violence seminars really help make us feel like we’re doing something to solve the problem? Is this truly a problem to be solved by University officials lanyway – so that we can all feel like we’ve done aomething to react? And if we find the guy who wrote the email and ruin his life – will we feel vindicated and happy?

“anonymous femal blogger” is demonstrating some of the key problems with USC undergrads: overuse of logical fallacies, weak critical reasoning skills, a devastatingly naive desire to believe that concepts like “sarcasm” (a term s/he clearly doesn’t  understand) somehow excuse active hate speech. Sorry, kid, your innocence is touching, but your misplaced aggression towards Winningham’s well-written and thoughtful letter is just plain annoying. Go read a book.
Langston is demonstrating some of the key problems with some grad students: unwarranted pompousness and patronizing attitude.
If I may give you a piece of advice when it comes to argumentation skills: it is good to substantiate your argument — something your patronizing comment fails to do entirely.  Where are the logical fallacies?  On what basis do you assess weak critical reasoning skills?
One of the problems with you people is that you call for dialogue, yet shut out anyone who disagrees with you.  The fact that the vast majority of people on this campus understand that the email was sarcastic, and the fact that all of you are not only refusing to acknowledge that factr but are taking this as proof of the “history of sexual violence at USC” (a concept unsupported by any data), its not a testament to undergrads’ innocence.  It is, rather, proof that what you consider to be “dialogue” is in fact a monologue, albeit one sung by a choir.
When you come up with a reasonable argument against the very plain and obvious fact that the email constitutes hate speech – and no, “it was sarcastic” does not even begin to constitute an argument – then maybe we can talk about the crazy amount of assumptions you’re bringing to the table. How do you know I’m a grad student and not a fellow undergrad, or just an interested observer? Did some TA give you a grade that hurt your feelings? Maybe having to do with your problems spelling? 
As a “femal” you have a responsibility to take the problems of rape culture seriously. If you do not, you’re part of the problem. End of story. If you honestly don’t believe that this email is part of that problematic culture, then I think you might want to sign up for a class on feminism – I’m sure they’re taught by full professors, not scary grad students.
“anonymous femal blogger” ignores Mr. Winningham’s argument. Whether the offense is punishable is precisely not the point. Some have defended the student’s first amendment rights. This, too, is besides the point. Legality does not necessarily correlate with ethics. What this article rightly calls for is an approach that does not simply seek out the individual who wrote the e-mail as the source, but instead works toward understanding the social conditions that make such an e-mail possible. 
The e-mail is far from sarcastic. There is no reason to believe the author used such language to convey contempt for misogyny. Sure, the e-mail is hyperbolic–though a very dangerous form of hyperbole, one that alleges a distinction between rape and non-consent. This stuff is only funny if we can find some cognitive dissonance and disconnect its words from discrimination against women and real acts of sexual violence. Such dissonance is wildly irresponsible and dangerous.
Lastly, I see no hint of judgment here. We, too, are part of a culture that takes such rhetoric as good fun, as part of a sort of sport. Why is this e-mail so offensive? Because we recognize its contents. They are familiar to us. They speak to a culture we’ve all seen or felt on or around our campus and elsewhere.
What kind of punishable offense is it, exactly, Tom?  Since when does your PhD studentness make you a legal expert, or an expert on morals for that matter?  
And what did you answer your student?  That because you put yourself on a  pedestal of moral virtuousness you have created for yourself, she is indeed wrong?  Did it occur to you that TAs like yourself who decide they somehow have the moral standing to judge everyone else, actually are the people creating a hostile environment in the classroom, by denying alleged offenders due process and by deriding and patronizing students who happen to disagree with your take?  And did you forget that sarcasm is a cherished and time-revered form of expression in the English language?
From your behavior, and that of the minority of grad students who side with you, it looks like you’re the one in need of attention, not the viral email.
He’s getting a PhD in English. Not a real doctorate.

Thursday nights at USC and fraternity parties on The Row ­­—the two seem to go hand in hand. But it looks as if 28th Street will be a much quieter place  Thursday evenings, for at least the rest of the semester.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
In a meeting with representatives from the Greek community last week, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson announced houses on The Row will no longer be allowed to host informal parties Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The meeting was called in response to incidents like the Kappa Sigma email and the Waite Phillips Hall occurrence that exposed the USC Greek system to national media attention.
Although the events that have perpetuated the negative Greek image have no real connection to the weeknight parties that have been banned, the USC administration is sending a strong message to the Greek community, and rightfully so.
Restriction of informal, unregistered parties on The Row, however, does not address the heart of the recent problems facing our fraternities and sororities.
Besides the fact that the two incidents making headlines had nothing to do with parties, the Row-wide social probation means the entire Greek system is being punished for the mistakes of a specific few.
Many  houses on The Row that uphold community standards will have to face the same repercussions as those that were involved in the notorious incidents.
The lockdown on weeknight parties should, however, serve as a jarring wake-up call for the Greek system.
Certainly, the harsh reality of the second social restriction on The Row in a single year should be enough to alert us that something needs to change.
In the meeting Thursday, Jackson did not focus solely on the two incidents involving members of Kappa Sigma.
He said despite the many productive things the Greek community has done for USC, there have been significant problems in both this semester and previous ones.
Last semester, for example, The Row was placed on social probation after 16 Interfraternity Council chapters were cited for unauthorized parties and several students were transported to the hospital for alcohol poisoning.
These problems not only affect the students involved, but also shine a negative light on the university as a whole.
The Greek community is a substantial part of the Trojan Family, and members should be responsible representatives of USC.
Lately, too many things seem to have been taken for granted within the Greek community, including the ability to throw parties Tuesday and Thursday nights.
According to university policy, these weeknight parties were never technically allowed, but Jackson said the policy wasn’t strictly enforced because the Greek community managed to conduct itself well.
The fact that Jackson and others feel the policy now needs to be enforced means Greeks no longer enjoy a favorable “blind eye” from the university.
The Row will be under heavier scrutiny, and it is up to Greek students to make sure we handle ourselves accordingly.
Jackson will be setting up a task force of Greek leaders to devise long- term solutions to the problems on The Row. This is a solid start, but changing the public’s perception of USC Greeks will take a concerted group effort.
Pat Lauer, president of IFC, told the Daily Trojan last week that Greeks need to take it upon themselves to fix their image.
“Because of everything that’s happened, we need to get our act together completely and identify our weak points and improve upon them,” Lauer said. “It’s up to the leaders to help change the culture of the Greek community that has taken a negative turn.”
What Lauer said should ring true with every member of the Greek community at USC.
Although the most recent incidents might not have involved every house on The Row, it is every house’s responsibility to present the Greek system as a positive force within the university.
If not, the Row could stand to lose much more than just the privilege of partying on weeknights.

April of last year was shaping up to be just another normal month. The weather was warming up. We were preparing for finals. Larry King had just left his seventh wife.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
And suddenly, there was that really big oil spill, the one that killed 11 workers, thousands of friendly sea creatures and potentially one million jobs.
You’d think we would have lost our appetite for offshore drilling for at least a year.
But March 29, House Republicans proposed several bills calling for a slew of new oil drilling projects off the coast of Southern California, and several other locations, within the next five years.
At the moment, the Pacific Coast is free of oil rigs, safe under President Barack Obama’s wing. Republicans in the House are working to change that.
Many people’s knee-jerk reaction is probably along the lines of, “This is a horrible, horrible idea.”
That reaction might be right. So many different explanations and sketchy facts surrounded last year’s spill, it’s hard for the public to gauge whether any real changes in safety precautions have been made since then.
Still, as much as most of us hate the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe and, by association, BP, some might be able to grudgingly concede the accident was an anomaly. Statistically, the chances of a similar disaster are low.
But the new bills proposed in the House hold the familiar, faintly sinister ring of oil-hungry higher-ups rushing a delicate process.
“[This is the] same pre-spill mentality of speed over safety that was held by BP and others,” said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in the Los Angeles Times.
Nervous yet?
To be fair, Republicans in the House are not pushing for new drilling sites for no reason.
The proposed bills are a direct result of the recent spike in gas prices, which caused many politicians to emphasize the need to decrease our dependence on foreign oil.
This might mean springing for new offshore drilling sites is actually our best bet.
But even if that’s the case, there’s no reason to rush into such a controversial and potentially dangerous decision.
Gas prices have risen before, and will almost certainly rise again. We can take a little more time to consider our options, to explore incentives for alternative energy and carpools or even to tap into our national oil reserves, though that last point is a controversial decision in and of itself.
If the Interior Department and all parties involved are confident in the strides our safety systems have made since the Deepwater Horizon spill ­— and can prove that key improvements have been made — then adding new drilling sites might be viable.
If not, the House is playing chicken on the Pacific Ocean’s railroad tracks.
High gas prices aren’t enough to warrant risking the same disaster twice if nothing has changed.
Last May, Rush Limbaugh famously proclaimed, “The ocean will take care of [the Deepwater Horizon spill] on its own if it was left alone and left out there. It’s natural. It’s as natural as the ocean water is.”
Even if we could accept for a moment that such a proclamation might be true, new offshore drilling rigs mean we’re no longer “leaving it alone.”
Without substantial improvement to our safety measures, it’s at best a gamble. At worst … well, we can look forward to Limbaugh’s attempt to make us feel better about it.

One thing you have to realize – there is no “rush into such a controversial and potentially dangerous decision” The leases must go through the federal government. California must accept the terms. The safety procedures will have to be reviewed. The benefits will be weighed against the costs. Like the nay sayers said ten years ago, “it will take ten years before any new wells start to produce.” And after the ten years of laying out money with no profits, it will be at least another ten years before the wells become profitable. Does that sound like rusting to anything to you? Even with our best technologies today, some wells end up dry or worthless. 
It would be prudent to start the process NOW, in order to reap the jobs, NOW and the oil and gas in my lifetime. As a student at USC, you may be well into your career before we see the fruits of drilling where the tar seeps through the sands of our beaches. Every one of those new jobs will assist our State out of its more than 12% unemployment – even if the rigs are abandoned before a single barrel of oil is produced..

This morning, members of the Clothesline Project at USC hung up T-shirts around Alumni Park decorated by survivors of sexual violence and the people who support them. Each color shirt represents a different form of sexual violence: grey represents gang rape; light blue and green are child abuse and incest; dark blue is for supporters of the cause; orange, pink and red stand for rape and sexual assault.
The clothesline display will remain up all week as part of a week-long event dedicated to educating the community about sexual violence. Today at 11 a.m. the Project hosted a sexual health fair on Trousdale, and later this evening they will hold a panel on rape in the military with experts speaking on the issue. The project will culminate on Thursday with the main event, Take Back the Night.
The Clothesline Project has occurred annually since 1999, and over the years its members have collected over a thousand decorated T-shirts.
Lauren Dawson, a junior in international relations and neuroscience and the Director of the Clothesline Project, said Take Back the Night involves many organizations working together.
“We are working with the Greek community to try to find ways that fraternities and sororities can get involved with Take Back the Night and the Clothesline Project. We’ve worked with organizations on campus like Fight On for Darfur, She Shall Go Free, and the Women’s Student Assembly.”
Take Back the Night starts at 6 p.m. this Thursday. At 7 pm, spoken-word artist and activist Andrea Gibson will perform some of her poems and discuss sexual violence. After that there will be a march through campus, followed by a survivor speak-out.
