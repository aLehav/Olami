A vehicle caught fire Wednesday afternoon on Exposition Boulevard and Watt Way, blocking traffic while firefighters addressed the blaze. 
No injuries were reported by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Smoke began to pour from the RV shortly after 4 p.m. in front of the entrance to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.
Graduate student Santhosh Kumar Seeralaselvan contacted LAFD of the fire at 4:10 p.m., but he noted other pedestrians who also witnessed the fire were  recording the event on their phones. After Seeralaselvan’s call, LAFD was dispatched to extinguish the fire.
“When I was coming out [of my apartment], I just saw some smoke coming from Exposition Boulevard,” Seeralaselvan continued. “Everyone around was Snapchatting.”
Exposition Boulevard was closed to car and foot traffic from Figueroa Street to Vermont Avenue. According to LAFD, there was no structural threat or injuries from the fire.
The Department of Public Safety sent a text notification to students at 4:40 p.m., 30 minutes after Seeralaselvan’s initial report to LAFD. Students were then informed of a formal incident resolution at 5:46 p.m. The area was reopened to the public after DPS reported the area was safe. Metro resumed service and traffic returned to normal condition.
Diane Sorkhab, a resident assistant at Parkside Arts & Humanities Residential College, was alerted of the blaze that occurred in close proximity to the residence. 
“The first thing that happened was that I got the text and from the perspective of the person who sent the photo, it looked like [Parkside Arts & Humanities Residential College] was on fire,” Sorkhab said. “I was a bit worried about everyone’s safety in the vicinity.”

Former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito saw patients on days when he had used illegal drugs, according to a Medical Board of California report made public on Wednesday.
The report found that Puliafito consumed heroin, methamphetamines and other drugs on a recurring basis while at the Health Sciences Campus and at other locations. The report also detailed that he gave drugs to a teenager and a recovering addict. 
In a story published in July, the teenager told the Los Angeles Times he visited Puliafito in his suite at USC, who then proceeded to smoke meth in a campus parking lot with the then-17-year-old.
“Until July of this year no university leader was aware of any illegal or illicit behavior by Carmen Puliafito and to date there have been no issues or complaints related to patient care,” USC spokesperson Charles Sipkins told the Times in a statement on Wednesday. “Once the university was aware of his illicit behavior, he was immediately removed from his patient care role and he is no longer employed by the university.”
State investigators also found that Puliafito had written prescriptions for a 22-year-old woman and her sister. The woman also told investigators that Puliafito helped cover some of her rehabilitation costs, and the LA Times reported that he would mail her drugs in packets of Skittles candy. She also said that he brought her meth in a sunglasses case in one instance.
The state investigation stated that Puliafito had a secret compartment in his car where he kept drugs. Puliafito had been banned from certain hotels in Pasadena and other locations “as a result of unruly conduct and behavior, including room damage due to drug use,” the filing claimed.
This investigation comes after the Los Angeles Times originally reported in July that the dean had surrounded himself with criminals and had consumed drugs while serving as dean of Keck.
Following a series of follow-up reports by the Times, Puliafito had his medical license suspended by the Medical Board of California and was banned from campus and its medical facilities. The University has also launched an independent investigation led by law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP.

Before alumna Andie Furber came to  USC, she had never considered teaching as a career. But she fell in love with working with kids after joining Troy Camp her freshman year, and now, she’s one of 29 recent USC alumni to join Teach for America in 2017.
This year, USC joined the list of top university contributors to the Teach for America corps, with 29 class of 2017 graduates entering the program.
Teach for America is an organization with a mission to recruit recent college graduates, who will commit to at least two years of teaching students in a low-income community school. The organization aims to increase educational equity among all students.
As a camp counselor her freshman year, Furber volunteered at an after-school tutoring program on Thursdays. 
“Every single Thursday, when I got to see [my kids] was the best thing I could ever do with my time,” Furber said. “Then I went to camp that May and I had my first cabin of third graders and that started the whole love of working with kids for me.”
Furber added that Troy Camp introduced her to her interest in teaching, particularly in South Los Angeles, where she was able to form relationships with her students. Through Teach for America, she is now working in a special education class of third- fourth- and fifth-grade students in the same area. 
“I was really involved in Troy Camp and especially love working with kids in south L.A. in particular because I think you have potential for a lot more impact and the kids really need that strong support system,” Furber said. “I was really excited about working in this community and staying in [Los Angeles].”
Furber graduated from USC in May, attended her final Troy Camp, and then went to Phoenix for five weeks of Teach for America training, where she taught 9th grade summer school in the mornings and attended classes with TFA staff in the evenings.
“I taught them geometry and they had to pass my class to get to 9th grade,” Furber said. “I got very lucky with a really wonderful class, but it was very different from what I’m doing now. I came into special [education] in particular kind of blind, and that was a little bit overwhelming, too.” 
Furber just finished her ninth week of school, teaching a class of 14 students. She said her experience has been overwhelming but very rewarding. 
“Every day is different and there’s a lot of things that come with teaching, especially teaching special ed,” Furber said. “I have some really wonderful kids. Today I had to leave for like an hour to go to a meeting and they said, ‘We’ll miss you!’ They’re super sweet and wonderful and I feel like I have no idea what I’m doing and it’s incredibly stressful, but a really wonderful experience and I really can’t think of anything else I’d be doing.”
Furber said she is not surprised about USC’s new status as a top contributor to the TFA corps and is proud that students want to be involved. 
“It’s very like USC to have so many people who are interested in doing good, especially doing something good for the community we live in,” Furber said. “It makes me really proud, too, because I always said when I was a USC student that I don’t feel like people take enough advantage of the community we live in.”
TFA’s USC recruitment manager and alumna Elizabeth Adabale said that the corps provides students who are passionate about making an impact and creating social change in a meaningful way, which is why so many USC students choose to join.
“I think that at a school like USC, even though we’re a research university, it can feel very pre-professional and a lot of students are like, ‘I have to go into the corporate sector right away,’” Adabale said. “But more and more students that I’m meeting with are realizing that there’s only few opportunities to really give back, and education is at the foundation of a lot of social issues that people care about.” 
Adabale said that TFA is not just a two-year teaching commitment — it’s a lifetime commitment to social change, and corps members are able to continue to make an impact once they’re out of the classroom. 
“Part of our organization’s mission is how do we help mobilize our alumni to continue their impact in whatever sector they choose,” Adabale said. “We have connections to graduate school programs as well as connections to corporations, and it allows for our alumni to continue impacting education outside of the classroom. That’s really what it’s going to take to create the systemic level of change that we’re looking for and to provide educational equity to students that need it the most.”
Adabale joined the corps after graduating from USC in 2013 and taught 11th grade biology in Los Angeles. Motivated to continue working within education but on a larger scale, she decided to apply for the role of recruitment manager. 
“I’m also from Los Angeles, so I definitely had a lot of frame of references, but it was definitely an eye-opening experience to learn more about our country and the things that are happening in our community,” Adabale said. “I would just encourage students that are passionate about service and social impact and are looking for a unique and incredible way to launch their career and to be a part of a movement of people that are dedicated to equity for all to look more into Teach for America and see if this is something that you might want to pursue.”

It is no secret that Los Angeles’ Koreatown neighborhood in particular, is filled with cute minimalist cafes; Midori Matcha, Document Coffee Bar and Alchemist Coffee Project all boast popular flavors such as red bean and matcha green tea. So what makes Café Bora different from all the other picturesque dessert spots? Their unique staple flavor: the Korean purple sweet potato.
Not to be confused for similarly colored flavors like taro or ube, Café Bora’s theme revolves around the taste and aesthetics of the sweet potato. The difference between Korean purple sweet potato and taro/ube is its taste; sweet potato is less sweet and has a nutty punch.
Café Bora —  “bora” translates to “purple” in Korean — is originally a popular dessert chain in Seoul, Korea, that recently expanded to its first location in the U.S. a few months ago. The dessert chain aims to not only provide joy, but also serve as a “refreshing reward with a sense of seasonality,” according to its website. Despite being open for only a short time, the shop is always bustling with customers.
While sweet potato is the main ingredient, it isn’t the only flavor offered. One of the most popular menu items is the strawberry bingsoo, or shaved ice. The shaved ice is the perfect balance of creamy and soft, with a subtle flavor that’s not too overwhelming. Other popular bingsoo flavors are purple sweet potato, red bean, milk and matcha green tea. Other options include the velvety soft serve ice cream and matcha tiramisu cake, which has the perfect texture and softness.
Melina Mae Castorillo | Daily Trojan
Nestled on the third floor of Square Mixx food mall on Western Avenue, the cafe is a bit of a hassle to find next to all the stores with names entirely in Korean. Visitors will be delighted by the hues of purple and white, as well as the beautifully arranged lavenders on each table that come in pink, purple and yellow. There are seating areas both inside and outside, as well as a miniature children’s play area right across from the cafe.
Those who come for the beauty and ambiance will soon discover that the food that appears too pretty to eat is actually as appetizing as it is pleasing to the eye. It is a refreshing change from the chain of dessert places that have opened to target the Instagram generation with products that fail to taste half as good as they look, like Little Damage and Bumsan Organic Milk Bar. Perhaps the most underrated item on the menu is the matcha green tea latte. It’s a perfect balance that’s not too watery or flavorful and has just the perfect amount of matcha powder. 
As part of a limited time promotion, Café Bora will give out a free miniature bouquet of flowers to all paying customers Fridays through Sundays.

Humans are naturally inclined to see ourselves and our environment as being balanced on elemental axes and Los Angeles-based electronic music producer D33J is no exception. The legendary Greek philosopher Aristotle posited that all matter in the universe is composed of four elements — earth, water, fire and air — that held each other in balance and appeared in everything in the perceivable world. This set of beliefs became the basis for the development of alchemy, a field of “proto-chemistry” primarily focused on transmogrifying metals into gold. If there were ever a modern sonic equivalent of an alchemical master, as someone who transforms polar styles of music into sonic gold, the title would certainly go to D33J in his debut album, Death Valley Oasis. 
Even before assembling his debut album, D33J had already made his mark on Los Angeles. Best known for being a member of the Wedidit Collective (alongside such figures as Ryan Hemsworth and frequent collaborator Shlomo), he has had a flurry of activity both within and outside the collective. With Wedidit, he helps to creatively manage the group’s label as well as their output, taking a prominent position on RIPFM, the group’s NTS Radio show, and their touring “DJ Team” alongside Nick Melons. Apart from Wedidit, D33J co-produced Corbin’s recent dark R&B project Mourn alongside Shlomo and toured nationally in support of the album. He even closed Boiler Room’s Rail Up party in Los Angeles, displaying his support for and extensive knowledge of Caribbean, South American and pan-African dance music. He is a true “avatar” of Los Angeles, incorporating and seamlessly mixing different elemental styles to create his own golden output.
As I was reading into the details of his new debut album Death Valley Oasis, I couldn’t help but notice the parallels that this album has to that aforementioned elemental layout. Taking some symbolic liberty with the track titles, I managed to cleanly cut the record into elemental quadrants.

The “air” quadrant of this album starts with the track “Ascent,” and spaces out the middle of the record with “Static Sky.”  “Ascent” is warm and uplifting, sprinkled with layered choral voices and a twinkling piano line, which slowly builds intensity before its synths fade into the aether. “Static Sky” functions well as an intermezzo, almost reminiscent of a broken transmission, broadcasted with an ethereal synth and bird calls. 
The “water” collection of songs on Death Valley Oasis all seem to evoke feelings of coolness and calmness. “Endless Fall” takes on the properties of a waterfall, opening with a descending guitar line before sinking into rhythmic basslines and snares. “Dead Sea” is the most lifeless track of the album, echoing its title, as it pulsates with dark, re-animated synths and a bassline reminiscent of dub garage. Surprisingly, “Black Ice” is nowhere near as cold as “Dead Sea” as it features prominent use of D33J’s vocal talent imposed over a frozen and meditative beat. 
“Spark” and “Scattered Ashes” make up the prominent “fire” quadrant, and both are as explosive and energetic as listeners would expect of the category. The album is made whole in its “earth” portion, which features collaborations from fellow Wedidit Collective affiliates Baths, Shlomo and Corbin. These tracks are marked by organic and wispy vocals laid over strong and undulating backing tracks, showcasing the best of each singer’s ability. “Wisp” and “Plateau” mesh well with Baths’ and D33J’s floaty R&B styles, while “Rot” showcases a traditionally dark and mournful Corbin over a comparably stark and sparse production.
In a Pigeons & Planes interview, D33J summarized his album in these three words: “Earth. Water. Fire.” He was allowed only three words to describe his album, but I have an inkling he would have said “air” if allowed a fourth.

Halloween season is in full swing at The Last Bookstore on Spring Street in downtown Los Angeles. 
On Tuesday, over 100 people gathered to learn about and participate in discussion of female serial killers, led by Tori Telfer, author of Lady Killers: Deadly Women Throughout History. So often, the public hears of women as victims of violent crime, perpetrated by killers like Ted Bundy or Jack the Ripper. However, there is another side to the narrative, one that places women at the center of the atrocious action, which the book captures. 
Telfer began the event with an excerpt from the nonfiction book detailing the life and grisly murders committed by Darya Nikolayevna Saltykova, a Russian noblewoman. Saltykova inherited a great deal of property and serfs, particularly girls, whom she then tortured and killed. Arraigned in 1762, she awaited the investigation for six years in a windowless cellar until finally being convicted of the torture and murder of 38 female serfs and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
In light of recent events, Telfer noted it is important to clarify the difference between serial killers and mass murderers. The FBI defines homicidal actions as when a serial killer commits three or more killings in a month-long period with an emotional cooling-off interval in between, often accompanied by an element of sexual gratification. This is in contrast with the definition of mass murder, which is the illegal killing of a group of people, suggesting that mass murders are typically isolated incidents. 
Telfer pointed out that a majority of the audience at The Last Bookstore was female, the same as the demographic of most true crime readers. 
“Women like to know, so they stay ahead of the curve,” Telfer said. “It makes them feel safer to know about these incidents because women are so often the victims of these crimes.” 
According to Telfer, this suggests that many women exist with an inherent mechanism of mistrust, one that may be essential to their survival. 
“Humans like true crime because they are real and scary stories, but ones we read from the safety of our own homes,” Telfer said. “It’s a very primal narrative of the hunter and the hunted.” 
Many male serial killers exhibit a common pattern of behaviors, known as the MacDonald Triad, or  the triad of sociopathy, when they are kids. This triad includes arson, cruelty to animals and enuresis or bedwetting, all of which appear to contribute to the likelihood of homicidal actions in adult life. In contrast, Telfer did not find any prominent patterns in killings committed by women, only common themes of desperation or twisted senses of love and altruism. She desribed the Angels of Death, a phenomenon in which those in a caregiving position use their power to kill people under their care, believing their patients are either suffering or ill beyond recovery. 
As a whole, female serial killers are known for being more pragmatic and can go undetected for much longer periods of time  than their male counterparts. Nannie Doss, known as “The Giggling Grandma,” was a serial killer who murdered four of her five husbands and went undiscovered by the media because of the intense cognitive dissonance that stemmed from stereotyping her as a grandmotherly woman rather than  a brutal killer. 
The Last Bookstore will host more Halloween-related events this month, including The Last Bookstore: Lost Souls Costume Ball.

Clay Helton photographed by Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
USC continued its week of practice on Wednesday ahead of a big road game against No. 13 Notre Dame. Head coach Clay Helton said the team solidified its third-down game plan and will practice Thursday morning before boarding a plane to South Bend, Ind.
Injury Update
Redshirt junior offensive lineman Toa Lobendahn sat out again Wednesday with a pectoral strain. The same goes for junior cornerback Isaiah Langley, who was held out with an undisclosed illness.
The defensive line will be hobbled against the Fighting Irish. Helton said that senior nose tackle Josh Fatu will probably be out as he continues concussion protocol after being injured in a car accident earlier this week. Helton also said that junior defensive tackle Rasheem Green did not practice as a “preventative measure.”
“We’re a little light,” Helton admitted when asked about the defensive line depth. 
Helton referenced redshirt sophomore Christian Rector, redshirt freshman Liam Jimmons and redshirt junior Malik Dorton as players who double-train, giving the Trojans flexibility to fill positions opened by injuries.
Helton also gave an update on junior linebacker Porter Gustin, who had an MRI and CT scan earlier this week.
“He’s just not right yet,” Helton said. “We’ll check it week-to-week, and when the doctors feel really good about it, we’ll move forward.”
In addition, freshman running back Stephen Carr was out once again and Helton listed him as “doubtful.”
On the bright side, Helton is optimistic about junior offensive lineman Chuma Edoga’s recovery from an ankle injury sustained against Washington State which kept him out the previous two weeks.
“He looks really good — he looks a lot better than he did last week,” Helton said. “He was right on the brink last week of being able to play and just didn’t feel perfect going into that Utah game after warm-ups, so we decided to hold him and get him really healthy. Fortunately, we got a victory, and now he’s healthy for Notre Dame.”
Focus on the Irish
The Trojans will have to account for Irish quarterback Brandon Wimbush, who has run for 402 yards on 5.9 yards per carry and a team-best eight touchdowns, while also throwing for six scores.
“We understand that he’s got a really strong arm and he’s a good runner, so we just have to play physical and fast the whole game,” sophomore cornerback Jack Jones said. “If we send too much pressure, he’ll air us out. If we sit back and wait, he can run for 80 yards if he wants to.”
Wimbush is just one part of a fierce Irish running game. Running back Josh Adams has rushed for 776 yards on nine yards per carry and five touchdowns. Notre Dame also has two more backs with four touchdowns each in Deon McIntosh and Dexter Williams.
“They run the ball hard: They’ve got three good running backs and a good group of offensive linemen,” junior linebacker Cam Smith said. “[Stopping them is] our main priority.”

The Trojan men’s tennis team heads to Malibu, Calif., on Thursday, when Pepperdine hosts the ITA Southwest Regional Championships. The opening rounds of doubles and singles will take place throughout the day beginning at 9 a.m.
The Men of Troy are expected to have a strong showing at this week’s tournament: Off the bat, the Trojans have more first-round byes than any other team in the singles main draw. Out of eight players sent to Malibu, five have a bye Thursday in the round of 128, including top-seeded junior Logan Smith, No. 3 junior Jack Jaede, No. 4 senior Thibault Forget, No. 12 junior Laurens Verboven and unseeded senior Jens Sweaney. Sophomore Mateusz Smolicki, redshirt sophomore Jake Devine and redshirt junior Tanner Smith round out the remaining Trojans who will compete in the opening round.
Smolicki will get things started for the Trojans, facing off against Chase Masciorini of UC Santa Barbara at 10:45 a.m. Devine and Tanner Smith both play at 12:15 p.m., as Devine takes on Daniel DeLaTorre of SDSU and Smith faces Andrew Whitehouse of Cal Poly.
On the doubles side, all three of the Trojans’ duos received opening-round byes, and they will immediately advance to the round of 32. Verboven and Smolicki come in with the No. 5 seed, Jaede and Tanner Smith received the No. 6 seed and Devine and Forget are unranked. All three matches in the round of 32 will begin at 9:45 a.m.
In last year’s ITA Southwest Regional, Logan Smith reached the semifinal while Forget forged his way to a defeat in the title match. Smith and Forget also paired up to take on the doubles bracket in 2016 and made it to the quarterfinal. This year, the standings are a little shaken up, with Smith surpassing Forget (No. 96) in the national singles rankings at No. 54. Jaede is also up there with them at No. 82.
Both the singles and doubles quarterfinals will be held on Saturday. The semifinal is set for Sunday, and the weekend’s action will conclude with both singles and doubles championships on Monday.

It’s Thursday yet again, which means that it’s time for yet another column about yet another nationwide scandal involving sexism in sports.
Again, I’m sorry. I wish I didn’t have to. But here we are, less than 48 hours separated from the debut of Barstool Van Talk, the newest show on ESPN that features the so-called “talent” of Barstool Sports.
If you haven’t previously heard of Barstool Sports, well, you’re probably lucky. Barstool is a “sports and men’s lifestyle” blog that operates most closely to a glorified version of Total Frat Move or Do It 4 State, but for grown men who have most likely not matured much past their fraternity hazing semester of freshman year. 
They’re best known for coining the phrase “Saturdays are for the boys,” a mantra quickly picked up by guys who like to drink lots of beer and post Instagrams of themselves drinking lots of beer. A regularly updated section of their site is the “Barstool Local Smokeshow of the Day” which basically just entails a bunch of pictures of the latest scantily clad woman that the staff has decided to drool over that day. One of the last headlines I saw on the blog read, “Is Rihanna going to make being fat the hot new trend?”
Don’t get me wrong — I understand that this is a satirical website and, like any other satirical publication, most of its content should be taken with a grain of salt. This is, after all, the same website in which authors go by names such as “Handsome Hank” or “Gay Pat.” I despise Barstool Sports due to the consistency of sexism, homophobia and racism in its content, but I’m not going to waste anyone’s time crying for every mindless, crass blog to be removed from the internet.
But that’s no reason to bring it into the mainstream, and there’s especially no reason to give it airtime on the most powerful sports channel in the world.
At a time when the sports world is fighting harder than ever to drive out these same issues of sexism, racism and homophobia, it seems tasteless and downright stupid for ESPN to bring this outlet on board. And it sends a message that left many sports journalists — male and female — outraged.
One such journalist was Sam Ponder, the host of Sunday NFL Countdown on ESPN, who posted the following excerpt that was written by Barstool Sports president David Portnoy (and edited to avoid printing an excess of expletives) in 2014:
“Editor’s note — I know Feits [Barstool blogger Feitelberg] blogged this already. But I wrote it up too because I’m fired the f-ck up. F-CK SAM PONDER THAT BIBLE THUMPING FREAK … this dumb. Seriously you sound like a KO Barstool freak, not a chick that has a job where the #1 requirement is you make men hard. So give it a rest with your righteous indignation. Your entire career and livelihood is based on appealing to guys like me and blogs like ours. Bottomline is guys thinking chicks are hot is natural. It’s Darwinism. It’s never gonna change. But that doesn’t mean we don’t respect women and think it’s okay to hit a woman. I have no idea what’s so confusing about that. Go f-ck yourself.”
In attempting to explain how Barstool Sports respects women — and in later addressing the tweet by Ponder — both Portnoy and the star of the new Barstool Sports show, Dan Katz, refused to apologize and continued to use aggressively disrespectful language toward women. The blog’s groupies are even more aggressive, and I couldn’t scroll through Ponder’s mentions without feeling physically sick.
Look, I get that ESPN needs to make money. Cord cutting, live streaming and Twitter are all draining the company’s
once-steady stream of income. The market is changing. But pandering to low brow humor doesn’t fit with the brand, the message or the ideals that ESPN has previously attempted to instill.
And the addition of Katz to the ESPN crew makes the recent suspension of SportsCenter anchor Jemele Hill absolutely mind boggling. If the publication wants to suspend all staffers based on their Twitter activity, that’s up to its discretion. But how, then, will Katz not be immediately suspended for the last week’s content — which is laden with expletives and sex jokes — on his account?
The most clear signal that a publication is pandering to its audience is when its previous logic begins to fail. That couldn’t be more true with ESPN and Barstool Sports. Sure, the first show did fairly well with ratings, most likely due to the aforementioned groupies, but at what cost? ESPN should take a long hard look at what it stands to lose by continuing to pander.
I’ve had a few friends attempt to defend the value of Barstool to me, and I’ve honestly struggled to respect that opinion even before this week. For example — the day after the debut of the new show, Barstool’s Instagram account posted a picture of a pumpkin involving sexual innuendo with the caption, “Real talk: Is this pumpkin tryna get the pipe? Discuss.” 
I’ll repeat — this publication makes sex jokes about pumpkins.
Is that really the brand you want to cultivate? I’m well aware that many sports fans can be empty-headed jocks, but that’s not the majority. Most of us who watch sports want content that involves analysis and avoids vulgar jokes. Believe me, it’s not that we can’t take a joke. It’s just not funny. 
ESPN, please take out your trash.

Last Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 19, a bill promising all first-time community college students free tuition for their first year. Although the assembly bill most directly affects prospective community college attendees, USC expects an increase in transfer applicants, and will in turn be impacted. For years, USC has consistently accepted greater numbers of transfer students than any other private institution. In Fall 2017, USC enrolled 1,300 transfer students, with 50 percent of those students coming from California community colleges. 
In contrast, other private elite institutions like Princeton University have admitted zero transfer students in over 20 years. In 2015, Yale and Stanford University enrolled 24 and 15 transfer students, respectively. USC has become an anomaly in transfer admissions in comparison with other private institutions, who are wary of transfer students and more motivated to maintain rankings, high graduation rates and selective admissions. Yet, with the prospect of even more community college transfer students in the next few years given increased access via AB 19, more private institutions, especially in California, must be ready to admit and enroll larger numbers, and subsequently open up their campuses to more diverse student bodies. 
While popularly imagined as under-achievers, the average USC transfer student’s college GPA of 3.7 is nearly equal to that of the freshman admit’s (3.73). Top public universities, who also accept a large number of transfer students, see minimal differences between freshman and transfer admits’ academic standing: UCLA and UC Berkeley both report less than a 0.10 difference in GPA between freshmen and transfer admits. 
In addition, many transfer students, especially from community colleges, achieve their goal of attending a four-year university by overcoming economic or academic adversity that freshmen admits coming straight from high school may not have faced. Others join four-year colleges after testing the waters of the modern workforce immediately after high school, and bring more diverse experiences with them.
Yet, as many private colleges neglect to “cash in” on the diversity of transfers, the absence of community college transfer students attending private institutions perpetuates the notion that private universities are reserved for more economically privileged students. This notion arguably dates back to the desegregation of U.S. public schools in the 1950s, when private education dramatically grew as a response to prevent integration. Since then, the stand-alone cost of a private education has preserved this impression, implicitly discouraging low-income students of color from diverse backgrounds from even attempting to enroll in private universities.
Nonetheless, a study by the Council of Independent Colleges concluded that low-income and first-generation community college transfers found more success at private universities, graduating in four years at higher rates than at public universities, despite the majority of transfer students transfer into public colleges. According to US News and World Report, the top 100 colleges accepting the most transfer students are public state schools.  
Many colleges tout their commitment to maintaining opportunities for undocumented students but continue to deny access to uphold atmospheres of non-inclusivity for transfer community college students, of whom a plurality are undocumented. According to the Los Angeles Times, approximately 61,000 community college students are beneficiaries of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. At Pomona College, for example, only 3 percent of its admits were transfer students. And Stanford, another elite private California institution ranked fourth in ethnic diversity by U.S. News, accepted only 15 transfer students in 2015, and did not disclose how many are from community colleges. 
USC has observed success on the rankings ladder while simultaneously accepting increasing numbers of transfer students. The University currently ranks as the fourth most economically diverse and 21st best university in the nation. These statistics should naturally allay other private colleges’ fear of a depreciated rank due to accepting more transfer students, and encourage them to follow suit. If private universities do not begin to admit and enroll more transfer students, then they are failing to promote and broaden their ubiquitous social mission to educate all students regardless of racial or economic background.
Trying to win over everyone isn’t wise. That’s a me-too, bandwagon mentality. Sadly, SC is trying to be everything to everyone. Just look at all the articles here on the DT, and the tone is SJW. It wasn’t that way when I went here 10 years ago; it was apolitical and neutral. If SC continues this course, it will worsen. There won’t be a USC 20 years from now.
USC admits way too many transfer students, a practice that: a) is unfair to the freshmen who worked their tails off to matriculate right after high school, b) dilutes the value of a USC degree, c) undermines the four year collegiate experience, and d) stands in the way of transforming USC into an elite private school.
USC should admit no more than 250 transfers per year, and most should transfer from other four-year schools.  Not every community college student has a right to attend USC.
Obviously, and ironically, the D.T. does not want a diversity of opinion, as is evidenced by them deleting my post.
Hypocrites of the highest order and down right ignorant. You do a disservice to everyone.
To be very clear, the reason the super elite universities do not accept more transfers is simply because they cannot find more students that qualify to meet their standards. They are not willing to have two different academic levels of students. If these transfer students could get into Harvard, Yale, etc, they would be there because these schools offer much better financial aid packages than does USC. So finances are not the reason. Academics are the reason. At super elite schools, all students are super elite. Not so much at USC.
USC has established, in stone, that we are willing to take a much broader range of academically qualified people. This is evident in the recent establishment of the McCarthy Honors College for the really bright new students: the ones who could possibly be accepted into a Harvard, Yale, etc.. Yes, you can eat there but you cannot share in the “Special Experiences” of the elite students at USC. It is reserved for them exclusively.
33% of all new USC students are now coming from Community Colleges. I’ve got news for you, these students are, by and large, academically inferior to the overall Freshman class. Of course their GPAs nearly mirror our regular Freshman class, they are in Community College–not the fiercest of atmospheres. Their test scores are, by and large, particularly low. Too low for a super elite school.
To add to this idea, California Community Colleges recently removed the requirement that a student has to be able to pass Calculus 101 in order to graduate. The reason this happened is because too few students could in fact pass the math. USCs response to this is to accept more Community College students.
Is it really diversity we are after or is it money. Since none of these students qualify for merit scholarships, they are barrowing heavily to attend USC. Just as do international students, where the student population has skyrocketed, all pay full-bore tuition.
During Max Nikias’ tenure as President, USC has increased the size of its student population by 33%. This is unheard of in higher education. Even with the University Village, we only have 9,000 beds for an undergraduate population of 19,000. Only 10,000 beds short. In order to finance Nikias’ super ambitious vision for USC, he is raising money any way he can and stuffing as many students into the school as possible is an important method. We are now as large as UCLA and Berkeley, some of the biggest public universities in the nation. We are ranked right along side them academically. We cost about 4 x times what they cost. Where is the value Mr. Nikias. You do not have to increase the size of the university by 12,000 students, which he has done, in order to achieve diversity. You do have to do it to pay the bills of your high dreams. I wonder if our diplomas are greatly devalued by the number of graduates coming out of USC. It looks more like a diploma mill than a Private elite university.
While I commend the discussion, criticizing Princeton, Pomona and Stanford for their small or non-existent transfer numbers bears closer scrutiny. The retention rates at those institutions are remarkably high and they are geared for a four-year experience for their students. With little attrition, there is little opportunity to bring in transfer students, whether from community colleges or other 4 year institutions.  USC has planned differently to include large numbers of transfer students.  Kudos to USC, but hardly a fair point to question few spaces at the institutions which have such extraordinarily high retention rates.
So here’s a question for you. Every affirmative action admission means that some white or Asian high school senior who may have dreamed for years of going to USC ends up instead going to a 2nd rate school. The whole life they could have had as a Trojan alumni, the Trojan family network, the advantages they’d get from having USC on the resume, all taken away. What would you say to that white or Asian whose spot goes to the affirmative action admit?
The United States put a man on the moon in 1969. What role did “diversity” play in that achievement?
Not only transfer students, but USC leads the nation in accepting international students who also contribute to the school’s diversity. However, sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more thing that makes being an international student away from home difficult, compounded by our complex culture and language. Welcoming and assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   Something that might help anyone coming to the US is the award-winning worldwide book/ebook “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” Used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors, it identifies how “foreigners” have become successful in the US, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to cope with a confusing new culture and friendship process, and daunting classroom differences. It explains how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also identifies the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of our universities and the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who shout the loudest and strive to stifle diversity!
Isn’t it interesting… Big universities pride themselves as institutions of ‘diversity’. However, ‘diversity’ in this case means everyone looking different but thinking the same. It is getting really old.

Last week, Democratic — and notably female — lawmakers, including Rep. Jackie Speier  (D-CA) and other members of the Democratic Women’s Working Group, rolled out the Title IX Protection Act. As its name suggests, the bill would codify Title IX guidelines from the presidential administrations of Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton into law. The need for this bill emerges from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ decision to roll back federal policy giving survivors of campus sexual assault additional rights and protections, which DeVos announced last month.
The issue of campus sexual assault affects male and female students alike, and yet, justifiably, it is still regarded as a women’s rights issue. A 2015 survey by the Association of American Universities found that one in four university women experiences sexual assault. On top of this, gendered perceptions of whether or not a woman is trustworthy — her sexual history, what she was wearing when she was assaulted — tend to skew the direction of proceedings, either with law enforcement or university administrators, against female survivors. 
DeVos, who has donated millions to Republican candidates and organizations promoting charter schools in recent years, is one of the select few women in President Donald Trump’s predominantly white, male, Goldman Sachs-cozy cabinet. Led by a woman, the political assault on collegiate women and survivors runs in sharp contrast with the broad narrative that more women in politics and leadership roles inherently equates to feminism. 
And yet, the introduction of the Title IX Protection Act, which would reinstate the preponderance of evidence guideline — a policy that lowers the standard of evidence to find someone guilty of sexual assault, and one that DeVos announced she intends to repeal — offers another perspective. Without a doubt, identity-based representation matters so that lawmakers understand their constituents’ experiences. But we need more than just women in office. We need women in office who will work to expand the opportunities of other women, be it through unconditionally supporting their human right to bodily autonomy or fighting pay discrimination and workplace sexual harassment. 
Emily’s List, a grassroots organization working to elect pro-choice Democratic women across the country, has received criticism from Republicans and centrists alike for being non-inclusive. But what would be said of the organization if it supported women who believe the state should be able to force other women to give birth? 
When Rep. Karen Handel (R-GA), who has expressed support for criminalizing abortion, won the state’s special election in July, Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter and asked, “Still waiting for the glass ceiling stories, or do conservatives not get them?”
Writer Alyssa Hertzig tweeted back, “Sorry. It’s just kind of hard to get excited about a woman who wants to gleefully rip health care access away from other women.”
Indeed, perhaps the biased, internet social justice warriors — with their outrageous double standards for conservative and liberal women — would write stories about conservative women shattering glass ceilings, if only they didn’t have their hands full writing stories about conservative women shattering other things — you know, like women’s access to crucial women’s health services. To conclusively answer Trump Jr.’s question, perhaps the left wing’s imagined “war on [conservative] women” will abate when conservative women end their war on other women’s bodily autonomy? 
Of course, none of this is to say that political polarization and lack of dialogue and understanding are not real problems — they are. At a time of increasing calls for sexual, racial, ethnic and economic diversity, many are also demanding ideological diversity. It may comfort those on the center right and left, perhaps even make them feel like better people, to surround themselves with different ideas, but many of them — that poor people ought to die because they can’t afford health care, that a man of color ought to spend his life behind bars for owning marijuana, that a 12-year-old rape victim ought to become an unwilling mother — aren’t just ideas for marginalized people. As policies, these ideas have lived and deeply detrimental consequences. 
Specific to DeVos and Title IX, the freshly romanticized “listen to the other side” mantra may have laid the groundwork for the education secretary’s equivalence of the accuser and the accused, a particularly tone-deaf suggestion at a time when crimes of sexual assault and rape result in the lowest rate of convictions, and some 63 percent of sexual assaults go unreported. Her rollback of Obama-era guidelines will negate the preponderance of evidence standard among other guidelines to protect survivors, which existed to compensate for how many survivors are not able to report their experiences immediately, or present any evidence beyond their accounts of what happened. Her ideas may be “ideologically diverse” in a country where most decent people respect the rights and dignities of rape victims. But to what extent should ideological diversity be the priority, when victims are forced to exist in a system wherein their sexual abusers roam the streets free?
What we as intersectional feminists need to be fighting for is more than ideological diversity, more than hollow representation. We need people who not only look like us, but will also fight for us.

Does the author want to comment on the fact that the effort by the California legislature to enshrine the Title IX kangaroo courts on campus, under the threat of losing state funding, was just vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat? Or are liberal politicians who actually use logic to veto such unjust laws not worthy of mention? That’s some fair reporting! Ah, to be a liberal “journalist” who gets to keep a job merely by spewing one-sided vitriol without considering such things as due process and the havoc rendered by identity politics.
More leftist drivel in this piece. If you want to be a fournalist, then you might want to emulate real journwlists. If you just want to be an oped writer, well, you’re doing that correctly, in true eat ist fashion. Attack, attack, attack, but no substance. That’s what liberals do; like a lemming.

Police recovered a student’s stolen car north of campus late Tuesday night, only to find that it was filled with items stolen from other students earlier that day.
Los Angeles Police Department officers received a call that the stolen car had been spotted in the area at around 11:50 p.m., and quickly arrived at the scene, along with Department of Public Safety officers and at least one LAPD helicopter. Three people were arrested in connection to the theft, and students were blocked from entering the section of Shrine Place, where the car was found, while police confronted the suspects. 
Danielle Binnette, a sophomore majoring in economics, said she woke up Tuesday morning to find that her car, a black SUV, was missing from her garage on Shrine Place. She reported the theft to DPS, and after reviewing security footage, she said officers determined that a man had entered her garage and taken her car, leaving the car he came in — which had also been stolen. 
Binnette said that her garage was locked, and she is unsure how the man was able to get in — but she was in the process of getting the locks on her car doors replaced, and her car key was inside at the time her car was stolen. 
Diana Kruzman | Daily Trojan
“I think they were looking around beforehand, because on the video, they went straight for my car,” Binnette said. “They knew whose car to go into, because my locks hadn’t been working for a week.” 
Binnette only found out that her car had been recovered when she looked outside her window just before midnight and saw it on the street, surrounded by police officers. Automatic license plate readers placed around the perimeter of USC had detected the stolen car heading southbound on Menlo Avenue, according to LAPD officers at the scene, who blocked it on Shrine Place before arresting the suspects at gunpoint. 
Once Binnette realized it was her car, however, she said that many of the items in it weren’t hers — and several other students confirmed that their cars had been broken into, and their possessions were found in Binnette’s car. 
Francisco Schirls, a sophomore majoring in film production, realized that his car had been broken into at around 9 p.m. Tuesday, and that several items had been stolen — including his guitar, a drone and the insurance and registration information for his vehicle. Schirls, who lives on Menlo Avenue, says his car was unlocked — but Maxim Smirnoff, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies who lives with Schirls and whose car was also broken into, said he locked his car and is unsure how the suspects got in. 
Smirnoff said his headphones and longboard were stolen and are still missing, while his books and several other items were found in the recovered vehicle. 
“I went through every scenario in my head,” Smirnoff said. “I lock everything, so that’s why I’m kind of paranoid. I have an alarm, I lock my car — and the stuff I had in there was hidden, not in plain sight.” 
For Binnette, the experience turned out to be a wake-up call. 
“I’ll be more careful,” Binnette said. “I need to order those locks, and not keep my keys in my car. I thought one day would be OK, but no.”

Two minutes into his discussion at Grace Ford Salvatori Hall Tuesday night, it was already apparent that Max Levchin did not fit the mold of an intimidating executive. 
The PayPal cofounder, who spoke to students from the Viterbi School of Engineering, kept approximately 140 audience members engaged and comfortable with his good-natured humor. 
“He’s truly a gracious, humble leader,” said Brooks Hosfield, deputy chief of staff at Affirm, a financial technology company that Levchin founded in 2016.
Ragini Holloway, the head of talent at Affirm, introduced Levchin by joking she’d need to peek at her cheat sheet to do justice to his veritable catalog of accomplishments: After co-founding PayPal, a widely used online payment system, Levchin went on to found photo-sharing company Slide, help launch Yelp and start Affirm and Glow, a reproductive health app for women.
Despite his impressive resume, Levchin said he almost felt awkward coming to the podium with the pressure of living up to such high praise. After noting that his PayPal days are well behind him — he founded the company in 1998 — Levchin launched into an hour-long explanation of how Affirm came to be.
Levchin discussed how he translated an individually damaging credit experience into a wider objective of improving transparency in lending.
“I was obsessed with the idea of building something different from my financial services background,” Levchin said.
He did so by venturing into the media and entertainment realm with Slide, but later realized that his passion lay in technology and intentionally seeking difficult problems whose solutions would positively impact as many lives as possible.
“How do you codify this problem of finding something that’s valuable and implicitly hard?” Levchin said, referring to the question he constantly asked himself.
From this cross-section of philosophies rose HVF Labs — short for Hard, Valuable and Fun. The fun component, Levchin said, encompasses Levchin’s emphasis on doing what you love.
“You can build a great company … but not having a lot of passion underneath, it crumbles quickly,” Levchin said. 
The entrepreneur specifically chose to tackle the financial world after experiencing a financial struggle during his college days at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A four month-late payment came back to haunt his credit score years later, Levchin said, even after PayPal led him to rake in millions.
 “The entire system is designed to permanently keep you down,” Levchin said. 
This frustration led him to start Affirm, a company structured so that consumers who want to borrow money know the exact amounts that they’ll be paying ahead of time, without any hidden fees. 
This “reinvented credit system,” as Hosfield described it, helps consumers avoid the vicious debt cycle, echoing Levchin’s own problem-solving philosophy.
“I feel most alive when I feel like I’m fixing something really important,” Levchin said.
The founder and CEO also noted that his main point of pride is Affirm’s Net Promoter Score of 82.
A company’s NPS essentially measures customer loyalty. For Levchin, building a company that people want to recommend to their friends is crucial, especially in a financial landscape full of banks with negative NPS results. He places a much higher priority on trust and individuals than on profit.
“We’re happy to take a lower cut but provide a better service,” Levchin said.
As for the future, Levchin said that he can see himself continuing in the finance industry even decades from now. Like a true engineer, Levchin constantly challenges himself to create better products, build significant solutions and solve hard problems.
“Nothing beats just heads down, working on something that’s going to be impactful,” Levchin said.

USC students are currently not allowed to carry food out from residential dining halls. However, a new resolution passed by the Undergraduate Student Government aims to change that.
USG voted 11-0 in favor of implementing a dining hall take-out container program at the USG Senate meeting on Tuesday night. Now that the USG Senate has passed the resolution, it must be reviewed by administrative officials before it can be implemented.
Senators Isabella Smith, Debbie Lee and Katie Bolton drafted the bill. According to Smith, this resolution is long overdue. 
“This idea has been brought up pretty much every year, and nobody has really followed through with it,” Smith said. “We just wanted to make something concrete so that the administration would have to respond back to this. We know that this is a feasible program because other schools have done it.”
Many other top-25 schools, including UCLA, Stanford and UC Berkeley, have take-out options in their dining halls, according to their respective websites.
During the presentation of the resolution, the senators acknowledged that the cost of the take-out container program is still undetermined, but described it as “minimal.” Several senators also discussed whether the cost of the take-out containers would be dependent on a per-use basis or a flat rate. Though no clear answer was determined, the senators said that these questions would be addressed by the administrative officials who review it.
Lee noted the importance of the implementation of a take-out container program, especially to students who have limited access to the dining halls on campus.
“A lot of freshmen have requested this, especially because the dining halls close at 10 p.m. and most college kids stay up long past 10 p.m.,” Lee said. “Because of this, freshmen often don’t have access to food.”
Smith also discussed other motivations behind this resolution, such as the appeal to upperclassmen and emphasis on sustainability. 
“If you’re on the apartment [meal] plan, you only get 40 swipes, or however many it is per semester, so it would be nice for [upperclassmen] to be able to take that food out,” Smith said. “This is also a sustainability initiative, because USC has an insane amount of food waste. An audit last year by the environmental board of one day at Everybody’s Kitchen found that people produced over 300 pounds of food waste.”
According to Smith, a previous hurdle involved in passing the resolution resolution was liability for the University if a student eats food after an extended period of time and becomes ill. However, she is confident that this will not be an issue.
“All dorms are equipped with refrigerators and microwaves so students have the option to take care of their food,” Smith said. 
Lee had a more direct justification for the new resolution.
“It’s a need,” Lee said. “People have been demanding it.”

Two new charter high schools recently opened in Los Angeles with help from the USC Rossier School of Education, completing a plan to establish five high schools that the school announced in 2012.
USC Brío College Prep and USC Esperanza College Prep, located in Westlake and East Los Angeles, respectively, are part of the Ednovate charter network, which inlcudes USC as a partner. They follow a learning style similar to that of other high schools in the Ednovate network, which focuses on personalizing the learning experience and using innovative technology.
“Now that school has started, we’re challenging students to think critically about how their everyday language affects the safety of spaces, how empathy goes a long way and how race, gender, education and other things contribute to how society operates,” Brío Principal Jeannie Cho told USC News.
Like the other high schools within the network, Brío and Esperanza started with only a freshman class and will add one new grade each year. The schools will reach full capacity in 2020.
Ednovate’s first school, USC Hybrid High College Prep, opened in downtown Los Angeles in 2012. It was followed by East College Prep in Lincoln Heights in 2015 and USC College Prep in Santa Ana in 2016.
Ednovate also accomplished its goal of having  every student in its first two senior classes from Hybrid High College Prep graduate. Each student was admitted to at least one four-year university, according to USC News.

On Tuesday, No. 11 USC began preparation for this weekend’s road matchup against No. 13 Notre Dame. The Trojans have an unusual week as they will fly to South Bend, Ind. after Thursday’s practice as opposed to on Friday. Facing a shortened week in Los Angeles, the team is focusing on rehabbing key players, while dealing with unfortunate news on the defensive line. 
Josh Fatu involved in car accident 
After Tuesday’s practice, USC head coach Clay Helton revealed that senior nose-tackle Josh Fatu was absent after being injured in a multi-car accident. Helton noted that the accident was not his fault.
“He’s going through concussion protocol right now,” Helton said. “He’s day-to-day.” 
The 6-foot-2, 315-pound defensive lineman is one of this year’s most improved players, stepping into the starting nose spot held by Rose Bowl Defensive MVP Stevie Tu’ikolovatu last year. Fatu has recorded 27 tackles and five sacks on the season. If Fatu is unable to play this weekend, freshman Brandon Pili is the next man on the depth chart. 
Other injury updates 
On Tuesday, Helton told reporters that junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin received an MRI and CT scan. Gustin has been out for a month with both a broken big toe and torn bicep, having not played since the Texas game. The coach noted that he would have more information regarding the defender’s status later in the week. 
On the offensive side of the ball, redshirt junior guard Toa Lobendahn was held out with a pectoral strain, while freshman running back Stephen Carr remains sidelined with a foot injury he sustained during the road game against Washington State. His status is uncertain for the Notre Dame game. 
Bigelow focuses on coaching
After multiple season-ending injuries over the course of his career, fifth-year senior defensive lineman Kenny Bigelow Jr. is likely done playing football. 
“He’s kinda taking a step back from the football aspects of things after two knee surgeries,” Helton said. “He’s really going to help us coaching. That’s what he wants to do, that’s his aspirations. He’s going to mentor some young kids for us and be around this team in a different role. I credit him for all he’s done here and how he’s helping us out. I love him to death.” 
Bigelow suffered his most recent knee injury before the start of last season and played very sparingly over the first half of this year. When asked if his new role was permanent, Helton said that it was “for now.”

Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
The No. 6 women’s soccer team (11-1-1) will be looking to add a pair of victories to their already impressive Pac-12 record when they head north to Washington to take on both Washington and Washington State tomorrow and Sunday respectively.
Washington (9-4-2) is coming off a tough road loss to No. 1 Stanford, falling to the Cardinal 1-0.  Although the breakthrough for the Cardinal occurred in the 86th minute courtesy of redshirt junior Kyra Carusa, the Cardinal had been testing the Huskies’ back line all night.  Stanford led the Huskies in shots (26-7) and shots on target (11-3).  This could be good news for the Trojans as they have constantly outshot their opponents this season, averaging just under 19 shots a game while conceding 8.5 per game.  
However the Huskies are not to be overlooked as they have an impressive record against ranked opposition this season, with their most impressive performance coming in a 1-0 home win against the then-No. 2 Florida Gators.  When playing ranked opposition, Washington comes prepared and plays hard even in defeat, losing 1-0 to both Stanford this past week and earlier to No. 18 Cal.  The Trojans must be wary of the Huskies as they look to add another signature win to their resume.
The Trojans will then take on Washington State (7-5-2) who last played on Saturday, falling to Cal 2-0 on the road.  The Cougars went down early in the sixth minute and never were able to mount a comeback, conceding the second goal in the 72nd minute.  The scoreline is deceiving as the game was quite an even affair, with the Bears barely outshooting the Cougars 13-11. This statistic should be of interest to the Trojans as the Cougars were able to consistently penetrate the Bears’ defense and make the day tough for the Cal goalkeeper.
The Cougars are led in offense by sophomore striker Morgan Weaver, who has 6 goals to her name this season and junior defender Maddy Haro, who has 4 goals and five assists.  The Trojans will have to be vigilant in marking these two attacking threats as they have proven to be dangerous throughout the entire season.
The Trojans are continuing to score for fun this season, hitting the back of the net 25 times this season while only conceding 8 goals.  The Trojans will need to continue this blistering offensive pace if they want results in Washington this weekend, as the Huskies and Cougars have only given up 7 and 12 goals this season respectively.   

In their last game against Colorado, the Trojans were able to start fast and take a 2-0 lead within the opening 20 minutes. Facing a pair of defenses this weekend that have conceded less than a goal per game, the Trojans will need to be smart in possession and in defense.  
If they can achieve this, it would be another giant leap toward Pac-12 dominance, as they still trail Stanford and are level on points with No. 2 UCLA.  Bringing a pair of wins back to Los Angeles at the conclusion of this weekend will be of great benefit to the Trojans as they look to close out their undefeated Pac-12 season, with their toughest tests still to come in the form of Cal, UCLA and Stanford.
