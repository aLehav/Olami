USC incurred extensive property damage and multiple students were transported for injuries and intoxication as a result of the annual senior fountain run, which took place Thursday night.
Youth run rampant · The annual undergraduate senior fountain run resulted in serious damage to “Youth Triumphant,” a fountain donated to the university in 1935. — Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
“Youth Triumphant,” a fountain located at the center of Alumni Park to the west of Doheny Memorial Library, suffered the most damage. The fountain features a solid bronze statue of a youth situated on top of a globe that was torn off by students during the fountain run.
The fountain run, which takes place on the Thursday of the last week of classes, is an annual tradition in which USC undergraduate seniors attempt to run to all of the University Park campus’s 30 fountains.
The property damage and injuries that occurred during the run came in spite of protective measures implemented by the Department of Public Safety in conjunction with the university. These measures included wrapping the fountains in specialized fencing to protect students from injury.
“A number of the fountains had some protective fencing that didn’t necessarily fence off the entire fountain, but the upper bowls or ones that had art work or apparatus that could lead to cuts,” said DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle. “Over the course of the evening, [students] tore down most of the fencing and caused significant damage to the fountain in the center of Alumni Park.”
The tearing down of the protective fences on nearly all of the protected fountains led to students being transported for lacerations and other injuries. Carlisle was unable to provide the precise number of students transported due to injury and intoxication. According to ATVN, Carlisle said approximately 2,000 students attended last year’s run.
“Youth Triumphant” was created by Frederick William Schweigardt in 1933 and donated to the university by Robert Carman-Ryles and his wife in memory of USC alumnus Edward L. Prentiss in 1935. In addition to the bronze statue, the fountain also has four “modest maidens,” symbolizing home, community, school and church. The fountain was last restored in October 2002.

In today’s society there is one thing that is clear: Marvel dominates the superhero genre. Although The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not from Disney and Marvel Studios, it is still a huge blockbuster that should dominate the weekend. This weekend also features Walk of Shame, starring Elizabeth Banks, but the box office should belong to Spidey.
The Spider-Man reboot has drawn a considerable amount of praise as opposed to the previous incarnation starring Tobey Maguire, and looks to be a major hit this weekend. Andrew Garfield leads the star-studded cast, which includes Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamatti. The film has received generally favorable reviews so far, but just the mere fact that Spider-Man is in the film should draw the majority of audiences. It should easily take the number one spot.
The other film, Walk of Shame, is a comedy starring Elizabeth Banks and James Marsden.  Banks stars as a reporter who is left stranded after a one night stand without her phone and keys, with only 8 hours until the most important interview of her life. Banks is well known as a comedy actress, so the film should be able to draw in some numbers. But a weak marketing campaign and lack of real buzz before its release could prove to be a problem.
Last week, The Other Woman managed to overthrow Captain America: Winter Soldier for the top box office spot, despite its poor reviews, but this weekend, The Amazing Spider-man 2 will easily take the top spot.
