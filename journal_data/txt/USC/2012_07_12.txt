Three USC players were named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Award, the Charlotte Touchdown Club and Football Writers Association of America announced Thursday morning. The award is annually given to the best defensive player in college football.
Sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, senior safety T.J. McDonald and junior cornerback Nickell Robey were the Trojans included on the list, which consists of 84 players – including 10 from the Pac-12.
McDonald was a first-team all-conference selection last season, finishing with 67 tackles and three interceptions. He decided to return to USC for his senior season despite being projected as a first or second round pick by many analysts.
Robey joined McDonald on the Pac-12 first team in 2012. He has been a starter since his freshman season in 2010 and had two-interceptions on the year, including one against former Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck that was returned for a touchdown. The Florida product also returned punts for the Trojans.
The youngest Trojan on the list is Bailey, who was named the conference’s freshman defensive player of the year after his first season of action. He had 81 tackles and two interceptions on way to being named second team All-Pac-12.
The winner of the award will be named on Dec. 3 at a banquet in North Carolina.

Senior center Khaled Holmes has been named to the Outland Trophy preseason watch list, the Football Writers Association of America announced Thursday.
Having already earned a selection to the Rimington Award watch list, which honors the nation’s best center, Holmes continues to attract the attention of preseason awards committees. Holmes joins 70 other players on the watch list for the Outland Trophy, which recognizes the top interior lineman in the country.
After receiving input from the FWAA All-America Committee, the 25-player All-America team will be announced. Three Outland finalists are subsequently chosen from that roster by Nov. 19, with the Committee then determining the winner by submitting individual ballots. The award recipient is announced Dec. 6 during the Home Depot ESPNU College Football Awards Show.
The Outland Trophy, awarded annually since 1946, is the third oldest award in college football, recognizing the country’s best centers, offensive guards and tackles and defensive tackles. It is named after John Outland, an All-America lineman who played football at Penn College, the University of Kansas and the University of Pennsylvania in the late 19th century.
Holmes will compete against Alabama senior Barrett Jones, who will seek to become the second repeat Outland Trophy winner after Nebraska center Dave Rimington accomplished the feat in 1981-82.

Friends of Ming Qu and Ying Wu gathered in front of Leavey Library on Wednesday night for a candle light vigil to remember the Viterbi School of Engineering graduate students from China who were fatally shot in April and to stress the importance of safety around the campus.
About 20 students crowded around a table displaying photos of the victims and two lit candles to pay their respects on the three-month anniversary of the shooting, as is customary to do in Chinese culture 100 days after death.

Haowang Wang, a graduate student studying industrial and systems engineering and former president of the USC Chinese Students and Scholars Association, and Julia Liu, a close friend of Qu’s family, spoke to guests about the importance of remembering Qu and Wu.
“Ninety days is not so long, but a lot of people already forget,” Liu said. “We read the news every day: Somebody was killed. It’s happened to another person, not to us. But, right now, we have friends in this tragedy, so we want society to remember them.”
Wang led guests in a standard three-minute moment of silence, which was followed by individuals stepping up to the photos to pay their respects and send well-wishes to Qu and Wu.
“As time passes, people will forget what happened, no matter how severe or significant the issue is,” said Joy Xing, a second-year engineering graduate student and friend of Qu and Wu. “We want to remind people that we had two excellent students and this was a senseless killing.”
Qu and Wu were shot and killed April 11 around 1 a.m. in an apparent robbery attempt while sitting in Qu’s car near the intersection of 27th Street and Raymond Avenue, sparking questions of the University Park Campus area’s safety. A wrongful death lawsuit filed by Qu and Wu’s families claims USC intentionally misrepresented the safety of the area to international students. The university has since moved to dismiss the lawsuit, but Wang and Liu both stressed the importance of safety during the vigil.
“You need to protect yourself,” Liu said. “No matter which country you came from, which state you came from, you need to protect yourself.”
Members of the CSSA also rolled out a banner reading, “Protect Our Safety.” Han Wang, who completed his master’s program at USC in 2010, said the CSSA made the banner about a month ago.
“It’s to keep in mind that we need to protect ourselves, like in foreign countries away from our home,” he said. “The USC neighborhood is not the safest place, so this is a way for Chinese students to keep in mind that they need a safe neighborhood.”
Xing also passed out fliers urging people to attend the arraignment of suspects Bryan Barnes, 20, and Javier Bolden, 19, on July 18. Barnes and Bolden were arrested in May and now face murder charges.
Xing said the CSSA created a petition calling upon the Los Angeles District Attorney for harsh punishment. She said the petition closed on the initial June 25 arraignment date but their message remains the same after the arraignment was postponed to July 18.
“We want them to give justice to my friends,” she said. “And we want them to emphasize campus safety so students can be aware of this safety issue.”
USC cannot protect you from armed thugs.  Get real people
