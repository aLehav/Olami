At 29 years old and after her father had gone into cardiac failure, Susanna Mage left her New York City apartment — where she previously worked in the biotech pharmacy industry — to travel to her childhood home in Delaware to take care of him. 
“Because [his condition] was hospice, I knew he was dying, and I knew it wasn’t going to be forever,” said Mage, now a doctoral student at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. “I saw it as an opportunity to be there for my dad when he needed somebody. He really wanted one of his children to be there, so that didn’t really feel like a decision.”
In the month Mage spent taking care of her father, she never considered it “caregiving” until she decided to return to school and looked into gerontology programs with a focus on older care. Mage read books to better understand gerontology as “the next thing in our society that is in need of a revolution,” reached out to USC professors in the gerontology program and applied to USC.
Starting her doctoral journey in 2019, Mage moved to Los Angeles and began working under Kate Wilber in the secure old age lab at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. She connected with Donna Benton, the director of the USC Family Caregiver Support Center, and became involved with the center, which allowed her to connect with other young caregivers who shared similar experiences.
Last spring, Mage received a text from her mother’s friend who suggested she travel home to see her mother after she was hospitalized with a blood infection. Mage returned to Delaware for what she thought would be a weekend during finals week but ended up staying home to become a caregiver again.
While her professors allowed her to push her qualifying exams and continue taking classes remotely, Mage also balanced her role as a patient advocate for her mother’s routine hospital visits, dealt with the physical demands of carrying her mother’s wheelchair and remained in isolation with her mother to prevent the possibility of contracting the coronavirus.
“What surprised me the most is how physically demanding it can be to care for someone with limited mobility, how heavy a wheelchair is, how hard it is to put that into and out of a car and how many people would just stare at me struggle and not offer to help,” Mage said. “Nobody told me how to deal with it, they just said ‘Here is your mom, here is a wheelchair, have fun.’”
One out of every four people is a family caregiver, whether it be an adult child caring for a parent, a sibling caring for a sibling, a spouse caring for a spouse’s sickness over a short period of time or for a long term chronic illness, Benton said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. Benton also said the pandemic caused a lot of student caregivers to feel isolated, and the return to campus caused students to make difficult decisions surrounding whether or not to resume campus life.
“With the transition back to campus, for some students, they may be more inclined not to return to campus but do more Zoom classes and remain remote, because of the caregiving responsibilities,” Benton said. “For others, it was a hard decision, but they did come back to campus, which meant that the families had to find someone else to step in for caregiving.”
Hosted by the USC Family Caregiver Support Center, a panel of student caregivers, including Mage and Benton, came together to reflect and answer moderated questions about their experiences balancing school and caregiving. The event was moderated by Benton and Wilber, professor of gerontology, which took place following a screening of Michelle Boyaner’s documentary about caregiving titled “It’s not a burden.”
Ricardo Alonzo Ugalde, a panelist who graduated from Syracuse University in June, took care of his grandmother until she died of the coronavirus earlier this year. He said balancing school, work and caregiving responsibilities involved comprehensive decision making and little flexibility.
“It’s expensive and time-consuming,” Alonzo Ugalde said. “If you are a student, sometimes you have to choose whether you want to go to class or take your grandma to the doctor or [whether] you show up to work or pick up your grandma’s medication from the pharmacy.” 
For Alexander Gonzalez, a panelist and 2018 graduate, caregiving meant putting his strained relationship with his father behind him to efficiently adopt the caregiver role that included having the same conversations with him about eight times because of his father’s forgetfulness. When Gonzalez became a caregiver, he was a full-time student, part-time worker and had a two year old daughter. Oftentimes, Gonzalez said he felt trapped by the stress of his responsibilities.
“Once [my father] realized that I was doing some things for him now, he told me, ‘Oh, it’s so funny, now it’s like you’re my dad,’ and that was really hard for me to understand because I couldn’t even accept the role of caregiving,” Gonzalez said. “For me, it was just helping out my dad.”
Kelly Marnfelt, another panelist and doctoral student studying gerontology, became a caregiver at 12 years old when her mother was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. Marnfelt said most people don’t identify as a caregiver when they assume the role without knowing what it means and feel overwhelmed by the obligations.
Marnfelt said the caregiver role can involve helping a loved one navigate the healthcare system, finding doctors or other professionals to come into their home or moving a loved one across the country.
“I started caregiving really young, and there was just a lot of confusion of trying to figure out and understand why it was so hard to get disability or hard-to-find resources, and over the course of 19 years, you start to learn that you can give care in all different kinds of ways,” Marnfelt said.
During the event, a young caregiver reached out to Mage, interested in becoming a student but unsure if her caregiver role would allow it. Mage said she plans to connect with the student to share her experience and show her that young caregivers can still have a life, even if they have to adapt it to another’s life. 
Along with support groups or connecting with other caregivers both through the USC Family Caregiver Support Center and through Facebook groups, Mage also helped start a peer-led support group for young caregivers to help cope with their situation and learn from others who have lived through the caregiving role.
“It was impossible to find a support group for young people, because the needs of young caregivers are really different from the needs of older caregivers and that has been really pivotal in my journey,” Mage said. “Being able to connect and know that I am not alone is almost enough to cure the social isolation.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Ricardo Alonzo Ugalde as a panelist who graduated from USC in June, instead of a panelist who graduated from Syracuse University in June. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

No. 21 USC ended its road trip with a 4-1 win against Arizona Sunday, maintaining its undefeated record in Pac-12 play after three games. The Trojans successfully beat both Arizona State and Arizona in back-to-back away matches to round out their visit to the Grand Canyon state.
After staging a comeback against Arizona State Thursday, USC headed south to Tucson in hopes of building on its prolific form in conference play by defeating Arizona. Last season, the Trojans narrowly beat the Wildcats 1-0 when then junior forward Penelope Hocking converted the crucial goal to seal a close USC win.
The Wildcats emerged as the early favorite during the 10th minute when a corner kick from junior midfielder Madison Goerlinger met sophomore defender Jenna Studer after a series of ricochets before she converted the opening goal. 
Continuing their trend of quick responses, the Trojans did not take long to answer after conceding the first goal. Eight minutes later, senior right back Zoe Burns provided freshman midfielder Helena Sampaio a through pass down the right flank. The debutant sent a pass to Hocking for the match’s equalizer. Hocking’s response marked her sixth goal of the season and her 48th collegiate goal to tie her as USC’s top goalscorer in women’s soccer history. 
The Trojans attempted 14 shots towards Arizona’s goal in the second half. They converted on their efforts in the 69th minute, as senior midfielder Madeline Vergura sprinted across the right wing before crossing the ball to senior forward Jada Talley for the goal to put the Trojans on top. Talley, an ex-Wildcat, grabbed a crucial goal against her former team. 
The Trojans opened the floodgates with a third and fourth goal later in the match. Sophomore left back Jaelyn Eisenhart shot from the left side of the box as the ball floated over Arizona junior goalkeeper Hope Hisey in the 79th minute. Four minutes later, freshman midfielder Simi Awujo found junior midfielder Croix Bethune, who converted the final goal of the day for the Trojans.  
Despite the comfortable victory, Arizona forced the Trojans to stage a comeback. USC conceded the opening goals in its last two conference victories against Oregon State and Arizona State. 
“There’s a little bit of frustration … our coaches have really harped on the fact that we need to come out stronger, and we need to come out with more energy,” Hocking said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
A plethora of players from different areas of the field contributed to the four goals against Arizona, with the likes of Eisenhart, Awujo and fellow debutant Sampaio getting involved in playmaking and scoring. 
“Our team is so dynamic … What [Keidane McAlpine has done] so much is that he gives a lot of players a lot of time,” Hocking said. “We have so many different players who do so many different things, so it’s super hard to defend.”
After three games in the Pac-12, the Trojans remain undefeated in conference play. USC is amid an eight-game winning streak, having never lost in September. 
“Team morale is really high right now, we just have to focus on the game in front of us,” Hocking said. “The Pac-12 is super competitive, and we need to focus on winning every single game … Losing and tying isn’t an option if we want to become the Pac-12 champions.”
USC will look to continue its prolific Pac-12 form on its return to the Soni McAlister Field against Colorado Thursday at 4 p.m.

Welcome to the first edition of Skyler on Sports. This column addresses my top three moments in sports over the past two weeks. There will be an emphasis on pro sports, with the NBA and NFL heavily featured. This week’s topics will include quarterback Tom Brady’s return to New England, junior quarterback Kedon Slovis’ performance against Colorado and guard Diana Taurasi’s status amongst the WNBA’s greats.
Brady vs. Belichick
This past weekend arguably featured the most anticipated matchup in regular season history — officially ranked as the second-most watched Sunday Night Football game of all time, Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers took on Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. Brady was passed over 198 times in the 2000 NFL Draft, but the Patriots head coach took a chance on the kid from Michigan who nobody wanted with pick 199.  
Brady wouldn’t start in the NFL until then starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe got hurt. Brady replaced the injured Bledsoe, which paved the way for Brady to become a starter during his second year in the league. He led the Patriots all the way to the Super Bowl in February 2002 before doing so again in 2004 and 2005.
Three Super Bowls wins amounted to a dynasty in the NFL, but this dynasty was different from previous ones. In 2007, Brady and Belichick completed a perfect 16-0 season as the entire sports world questioned if the 2007-08 Super Bowl favorites were the greatest dynasty of all time. Not only this, but with superstar wide receiver Randy Moss, Brady broke the all-time single-season passing touchdown record as he became the first quarterback to ever throw 50 touchdowns in a season. The New England Patriots made it all the way to the Super Bowl with an 18-0 record, but were thwarted by Eli Manning and the New York Giants in arguably the biggest sports upset of all time.
Four years later, Brady would have his chance at revenge. Brady proved he could beat the best with three Super Bowl victories and playoff wins over quarterbacks such as Kurt Warner, Donovan McNabb, Ben Roethlisberger, Philip Rivers and Peyton Manning. However, the winningest quarterback in NFL history would of course rebound as he won three more Super Bowls with the Patriots including a win where Brady led a comeback trailing 28-3 in the third quarter in what many call the greatest Super Bowl of all time.
Brady and Belichick won six Super Bowls in 20 seasons together with the Patriots, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise in NFL history. This meant Brady already tied for the most Super Bowl wins by any NFL franchise — by himself. He then went to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as he proved he could win a Super Bowl without Belichick against the league’s future: Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. This is still Brady’s league, however, as he threw for nine touchdowns in his first two games this year for one of the hottest starts in NFL history. Belichick hasn’t fared well since their breakup, as the Patriots are on to their second quarterback since Brady’s departure and entered Sunday’s contest 1-2 with their lone victory coming against the lowly New York Jets.
The reality of the game was that it didn’t live up to the hype on the field, but it’s the context of the situation that will make this one of the most memorable games in regular season history. Brady beat his former team as he passed Drew Brees’ record to become the NFL’s all-time leader in passing yards. He also became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to beat all 32 franchises along with Brees, Dan Marino and Manning. 
Many rumors surround the relationship between Brady and Belichick. It seems as though there was legitimate tension between the two, but even after all the bad blood, they shared a brief hug on the field before the greatest coach and the greatest quarterback of all time had a 20 minute conversation set up by Belichick after the game. What one wouldn’t give to be a fly on the wall to that conversation as Brady aims to win his eighth Super Bowl this year.
Kedon Slovis looked like Kedon Slovis again
After last week’s blowout loss to Oregon State, USC rebounded in an offensive explosion against Colorado. Junior quarterback Slovis trained with 3DQB, a quarterback mechanics training run by alumnus Adam Dedeaux, who has trained quarterbacks including Brees, Matt Ryan and Brady. Slovis, who excelled as a freshman, was expected to have his throwing motion and mechanics back to his best this season after his offseason training, and on Saturday, it finally looked like it was coming together for him. In particular, Slovis threw an absolute dart to sophomore receiver Gary Bryant Jr. that made it look like he was in peak form.
Slovis threw for 276 yards to go along with three touchdowns and also threw some bombs to junior receiver Drake London, including a spectacular one-handed snag for a score. Colorado’s offense has been anemic in the past few weeks while its defense hasn’t been stellar either, so people shouldn’t get too high on the Trojans yet, but it was a nice win to enjoy. If USC can see what it did well and apply it on a higher level, this win could prove to be a spark.
Diana Taurasi proves she’s the GOAT of the WNBA
The WNBA playoffs are currently taking place, and, at 39 years old, Taurasi, the WNBA’s all-time leading scorer, continues to prove why she is the greatest to ever do it. 
Taurasi went for 37 points on 10 of 13 shooting and 8 of 11 from 3-point land as she became the oldest player with a 30-point game in WNBA playoff history. Taurasi also holds the fourth-highest scoring total in a single game in WNBA history at 47 points, along with a multitude of other records. 
Taurasi is known as the “White Mamba”, a nickname given to her by global icon and NBA legend Kobe Bryant. She shares an otherworldly scoring ability, especially in clutch situations, being able to hit shots from anywhere on the floor. Taurasi’s Phoenix Mercury are currently up 2-1 on the Las Vegas Aces in the WNBA Western Conference semifinals with Game 3 set for Wednesday.

This past weekend, USC traveled to Alaskan Airlines Arena to play the No. 13 Washington for a Pac-12 conference matchup. The Huskies bested the Trojans 3-1 (22-25, 25-20, 25-13, 25-19). The Trojans now stand with an overall record of 6-7 and are 2-2 in Pac-12 play.
At the start of the match, the Trojans seemed to control the pace of the game, never trailing behind Washington in the first set. Graduate student outside hitter Brooke Botkin sparked the intensity for USC as she collected seven of her 17 kills in the first set, helping the Trojans take away the first, 22-25.
The Huskies responded quickly, putting pressure on the Trojans from the service line. With errors at the net and Washington’s junior setter Ella May Powell landing three service aces, the Huskies quickly took the lead in the second set. The Trojans stayed in the match with pivotal swings from junior opposite hitter Emilia Weske and graduate student outside hitter Shannon Scully. Unforced errors hurt USC though and gave Washington the second set, 25-20.
Washington rode the momentum and the energy from the home crowd to close out the next two sets 25-13 and 25-19, respectively.
“I think they got better and just increased their level of play both in serving and blocking,” said Head Coach Brad Keller. “We made a ton of errors and kind of got in our own way, we got quiet.”
Since last playing in the Galen Center, USC made a few changes to the lineup. Scully moved from libero to outside hitter, sophomore Sam Hastings to libero and freshman Tyrah Ariail to middle blocker.  
“We were not getting enough production from our pins at the time,” Keller said. “We need more production out of all three pins, and we need better passing. So that was the idea that this lineup would give us the chance to do that.”
Prior to playing the Huskies, the Trojans faced Washington State the same weekend, a matchup  in which the Trojans emerged victorious, 3-1.
“Anytime you split on the road, it’s actually a positive,” Keller said. “I don’t want to be splitting anytime, but if you’re on the road and you’re splitting, it’s tough to play on the road. To be able to do that is a positive, but at the end of the day we need to execute better. We need to execute for longer stretches of time, we can’t feel sorry for ourselves.”
Now the Trojans will travel back home to prepare for their first Pac-12 conference match at the Galen Center.
“If we’re going to be playing home in the Galen Center then we need to put up a much better and consistent product,” Keller said. “We’re going to be working on just that [this week]. It’s going to be on execution and understanding roles and responsibilities throughout the plays and to make the proper touch on those plays. We have a lot to do before Friday.”
The Trojans head back home to play Friday against Utah. The match starts at 7 p.m.

With homelessness on the rise throughout Los Angeles, the USC Homelessness Initiative began in 2016 and initially prioritized on-campus homelessness but soon expanded to the greater L.A. community and research about creating necessary interventions. 
But earlier this year, former director Brenda Wiewel said she was informed that the group will “sunset” due to a lack of funding. 
“It just got to a point over the last year where I was just told that there wasn’t sufficient funding to have it go one more year,” Wiewel said. “I was told that that decision had been made to sunset.”
Wiewel said she was “laid-off” from the position and told the initiative needed to close.
“The structure of an actual initiative that brings together the big picture as kind of a hub or clearinghouse for the University as a whole — I don’t see that happening,” Wiewel said. “There’s still a number of projects but as far as I’m concerned it’s not under the umbrella of an initiative anymore.”
USC in a statement to the Daily Trojan, said the initiative is in transition, not sunset as its community partnerships, research and policy initiatives continue. 
“The USC Homelessness Initiative, including its website and other resources, [are] currently in transition as we seek to deepen our collaboration within the University and with our partners across Los Angeles,” the statement read.
In the last year, an array of factors led to funding challenges. Alongside changes in administrative leadership, the initiative’s source of funding — donations from the different schools within USC — soon became unstable. 
“Over the years, especially with a whole variety of different issues that came up, the schools began to have a lot less money available,” Wiewel said. “Then the provost changed and the president changed, so the original champions were no longer there. It wasn’t that the other people didn’t care but that they hadn’t actually initiated it.”
While it operated, the initiative aimed to mobilize students to become involved in community-based work through internships, volunteer opportunities and professional training for future careers.
Josh Gonzales, a second-year graduate student, was placed in the initiative as part of the Master’s of Social Work program this past summer. The budget cuts occurred “pretty much right after [he] started,” so he was not directly able to work with the initiative.
Gonzales said he found news of the initiative’s sunset “frustrating” given how prevalent an issue homelessness remains in L.A. However, he said he feels these changes can further inspire people to help tackle homelessness.
“It’s a little bit frustrating but it’s also really motivating to continue to do the work because there’s no longer this official, active initiative behind the work,” Gonzales said. “It feels all the more urgent and important to continue the legacy of projects that it has.”
Senior Kevin Maxwell, who became involved in the USC Homelessness Initiative through a class, was drawn to the organization because he has personal experiences witnessing homelessness among family members. He said the budget cuts were “disappointing” and could negatively impact the University’s response to the housing crisis.
“It just takes away from USC’s ability and participation in trying to raise awareness about homelessness,” Maxwell said. 
Wiewel said several student-led projects and events were supported by USC Homelessness Initiative, including Trojan Shelter and Homeless Awareness Week. She said the initiative effectively connected different groups. 
“I keep hearing still about people who learned about each other’s projects and started working together and created new things out of that so I felt like that was worthwhile,” Wiewel said. Beyond volunteering or research projects, the initiative also oversaw the creation of a free online library guide and informative YouTube channel.
For Wiewel, the initiative’s role as the central hub for other programs to filter through or receive support had a “snowball effect” in engaging people. 
“When you’ve got something that’s sanctioned from the very top, it really motivates everybody,” Wiewel said. “It’s like, this is our priority as a University, and so people who wanted to do it but might not have felt like they had the authority or the authorization for it got involved in ways that they might not have before.”
Despite the uncertain status of the initiative, optimism remains about its legacy through ongoing programs. Dr. Laura Mosqueda, former dean of the Keck School of Medicine, commended USC Street Medicine, a program in the Department of Family Medicine that brings together healthcare professionals to provide and advocate for medical care for the homeless. 
“[The USC Homelessness Initiative] really underscored the fact that it takes a village, and that this is a really complicated problem, and that it’s great if the medical school [helped] people to get medical care,” Mosqueda said. “But then the work that was being done by the other schools was equally important.”
Other projects on campus preserve USC Homelessness Initiative’s purpose, such as the Center for Artificial Intelligence for Society, a collaboration between the Viterbi School of Engineering and the School of Social Work.
“They’re doing some really groundbreaking research in the area of homeless youth, as well as how to deal with racial equity,” Wiewel said. “They’ve done some beautiful work.”
For Gonzales, the initiative’s “sunset,” as Wiewel said, does not signal an end but the possibility for new projects to pick up where they left off, such as establishing a campus chapter of Abundant Housing LAs, a policy-focused nonprofit. In addition, he is working on a project called the Trojan Homelessness Response with junior Pratik Thakur, another student formerly involved with the USC Homelessness Initiative. 
Wiewel said the many accomplishments made by the Homelessness Initiative allowed for a sufficient conclusion after a successful run. 
“Over the last five years, a lot of good work has been done,” Wiewel said. “A lot of things had been starting and were continuing to grow. So I felt like, not that there couldn’t still be some things to work on, but I kind of felt like it wasn’t a bad time to transition.”

With the semester in full swing, the sight of color-coordinated notes and annotated textbooks beckons the member at the top of the college food chain: the girlboss. 
Once thrown around as a comedic gimmick and ironic term, the modern-day girlboss has reconfigured itself through 60-second TikTok videos that appeal aesthetically to students of all ages. Sophia Amoruso, entrepreneur and Nasty Gal founder, popularized the term “girlboss” in 2014 through her company and book of the same name. Consequently, it became synonymous with hustle culture.
Eight years ago, if you were a young, ambitious white woman seeking to break through the rigid hierarchy at your workplace, Sheryl Sandberg was your guide. “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,” Sandberg’s bestselling 2013 book, was your scripture. 
Through the lens of personal growth, the book laid out a game plan for workplace success. If women simply “leaned in,” could we singlehandedly change the system through self-motivated behavioral choices? 
The distinction between institutional barriers and internal barriers is the “ultimate chicken-and-egg situation,” Sandberg wrote. To the girlboss archetype, however, no task was impossible when jotted down into a bullet journal. 
The girlboss was the millennial symbol of unapologetic ambition. Her greatest pleasure was success; being underestimated pushed her to prove her worth. By highlighting workplace gender disparities as battles fought on the personal level, Sandberg helped women view themselves as activists whenever they spoke for themselves. It was inspiring to feel like you were on the right side of a righteous cause, as if you’d received the long end of the stick — or rather, history.
To some, being a girlboss meant you succeeded in whatever endeavor you set your sights on. It was a term that inspired and motivated, something plastered across laptop lock screens and flyers that kept us focused as we worked to turn our pipedream into a reality. For others, particularly those lower on the professional ladder, the reality was far bleaker. 
If not a false feminist front programed to conceal the toxic reality of workplace culture, what is the average girlboss? Woke capitalism elevates elites, so they maintain the status quo while turning a blind eye to the demands of activists. As ethical consumers, millennials feel like they’re making a difference every time they cross off an item on  their checklist. 
In that sense, the girlboss strife sheds light on the socioeconomic divide within education and the workplace, where this whitewashed image of a girlboss has become mainstream. It’s a thinly-veiled disguise of the equally damaging toxic productivity culture rampant among university students. 
Despite her motivational book and outwardly feminist branding, Amoruso amassed her fortune through fast fashion, an industry notorious for exploiting and profiting off Black and brown women. Her career at Nasty Gal halted upon accusations of abusive management and discrimination, all culminating in the company filing for bankruptcy in 2016. 
When your perceived productivity is marketed as success, do you truly reap the benefits, or has capitalism conditioned you into the hustle culture of a nine-to-five? Seven years later, the former archetype of a girlboss — a wealthy, college-educated white woman — is now shorthand for a type of fake-woke, white feminism. 
As we collectively inch away from girlboss culture and the chains of nonstop hustling, it’s essential we continue to demand transparency from brands and companies, not settling until authority figures exercise their influence and implement feedback from their employees. 
We need to leave outdated gender roles behind us and empower businesswomen to focus on purpose over profit. The notion that a female leader could single-handedly solve the problems inherent to capitalism counterproductively places immense pressure on young women. 
In a society where Eurocentric features place you at the forefront of capitalism’s gains and paint you as a notable figure in history, we must rattle white hegemony to liberate women of color from the tribulations of the girlboss rhetoric. 
Until the United States recognizes its extraordinary wealth inequality and the government requires corporations to pay their fair share in taxes, we will continue to see girlboss reincarnations. She is a manifestation of the U.S. myth: If you’re not succeeding, you’re not trying hard enough. 
Instead of girlbosses, some of us are sleep-deprived undergraduates who need to meet their 11:59 p.m. deadline.

When it comes to labor practices, history is a great indicator of what works and what doesn’t work. We take a lot of things for granted nowadays, including practices in the workforce. We still have a ways to go until the working class experiences justice, but we owe shorter work days, generally safer working conditions and better benefits to the folks who came before us. 
We are in a much better place now than decades ago because past laborers refused to stand by while employers subjected them to undignified conditions and starvation wages. A recent Bloomberg opinion article, however, promoted the benefits of Amazon company towns. The writer seems to have completely forgotten business-built towns’ horrible conditions. 
While many may not know about company towns, we should be glad they aren’t as common anymore. Typically in rural and isolated areas, company towns center around large industries or factories that produce raw materials or products, such as coal or automobiles. 
Company workers — and their families — usually live in company towns and go to nearby factories or plants for work. These towns may offer recreational activities in addition to housing, and it isn’t uncommon for a company town to pay their employees in scrip, or non-legal tender, for them to use exclusively in the towns’ stores.
Currently, Amazon doesn’t own any company towns, but it employs some of the same sleazy tactics and practices that made company towns reprehensible. First and foremost, company towns often don’t have the best working conditions. Amazon’s horrid workplace environment — including unreasonably high mandated hours, extremely short breaks and an injury rate three times the national average — are well documented.  Therefore, it is doubtful Amazon would suddenly employ better workplace practices if it were to organize and run its own company town.
Additionally, the company’s sheer presence makes it an ever-expanding tenant. Amazon has a lot of influence whenever it occupies an office space or builds a fulfillment center because of the prospective positive economic impact. Recall the intense PR battle between states and local governments back in 2017 when Amazon looked to build another headquarters. If it means bringing jobs to their area, states and local governments contort themselves to appease the company while not paying any mind to the quasi-company town’s long-term effects on their communities. 
The residents of Otay Mesa currently feel the effects of what could be an Amazon company town in the making. In this quiet, unbothered part of southern San Diego, Amazon plans to build a new distribution center, and resident advocates worry that Otay Mesa’s affordable housing plans will build housing in industrialized areas. A company-centered housing development might as well just be labeled a company town. In Otay Mesa’s case, however, the local government is doing most of the building. 
Building housing and communities around industrialized companies — especially in a day and age when  companies exploit cheaper labor — is short-sighted. If Amazon were to close its Otay Mesa facility, what would happen to the people who worked at the company and lived in the surrounding housing units? In West Virginia, a local union branch warned families they would probably have to sell their homes and relocate when a pharmaceutical plant closed and moved its operations to India and Australia. Companies can quickly pack up and move their operations, but middle and working-class families aren’t afforded that same kind of privilege. 
We also shouldn’t forget about scrip: At least one Amazon facility rewarded their workers with “swag bucks,” which were only valid for purchasing Amazon products. While “swag bucks” are merely an incentive, Amazon blatantly attempts to cheat their workers out of real money through the use of non-legal tender, which makes them dependent on the company. How can Amazon workers possibly build wealth when part of their hard-earned money comes in the form of fake money?
The only thing stopping Amazon from creating full-fledged company towns is the expense of developing land, which is comparatively higher than the cost of leasing office space and facilities. One quick look at Amazon and its recent business decisions, combined with its history as an employer, doesn’t exactly paint the company as a benevolent employer. If Amazon starts to seriously consider building company towns in the near future, state and local governments ought to give the industry behemoth the cold shoulder.

As we approach the last half of Latinx Heritage Month, it is the perfect time to support the artwork of directors you may not have heard of before. Take some time in the following weeks to sit down and experience a perspective you may not be familiar with. Keep reading for a list of directors, and their movies, to watch and support this month. 
Lila Avilés
Lila Avilés is an emerging director already making waves. Her first film got her chosen as the Mexican submission for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. Variety lists her as part of a “Mexican [revolution]” in the movie world.
Consider watching: “La Camarista” (2018)
The tale of a maid in a luxurious hotel in Mexico, “La Camarista” is a heartbreaking story about a service worker who is constantly disrespected and underpaid. Watch this film if you like slow-paced, character-based movies. 
 Patricia Cardoso
Patricia Cardoso, a Colombian director, focuses her work on disrupting Latinx stereotypes in Hollywood. The first Latina to win a Sundance Audience Award and be featured in the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry for her film “Real Women Have Curves,” Cardoso has broken down many barriers for other Latina filmmakers. Despite her great success, Cardoso was shut out by Hollywood and unable to make a living as a director until just three years ago when Ava DuVernay hired her to direct an episode of “Queen Sugar.” So, this Latinx Heritage Month, take some time to support a woman who paved the way for others.
Consider watching: “Real Women Have Curves” (2002)
Did you love “Lady Bird”? Watch this coming-of-age movie about a young Latina struggling between following her dreams and meeting her mother’s expectations. 
Tatiana Huezo
Born in San Salvador, El Salvador and raised in Mexico, Tatiana Huezo is a documentary filmmaker who focuses her work on the lives of people  in Mexico and Central America. One of the leading female documentarians in Mexico, Huezo hopes to pave the way for more like her in the future. She is also the only Latina director to have her work included in the  “Un Certain Regard” section of the Cannes Film Festival. 
Consider watching: “Tempestad” (2016)
This documentary follows two women in Mexico: one wrongly accused of taking part in human trafficking and another looking for her missing daughter. 
Anna Muylaert
A highly awarded Brazilian screenwriter and director, Anna Muylaert revolves her filmography around Brazilian lives and struggles, while also falling into different genres and themes. As she continues to gain mainstream success, Muylaert uses her popularity to speak out against the sexism that she and other women face in the industry. 
Consider watching: “Que Horas Ela Volta?” (2015)
In the movie, a daughter returns to her mother after she was abandoned. The daughter discovers her mother is a nanny to a wealthy family, and their reconnection shakes up their preconceived understanding of class structures. 
Mariana Rondón 
Mariana Rondón is a Venezuelan film director who focuses her work on the lives of underrepresented people. Along with other Latinx film directors, she founded Sudaca Films, an arthouse film company focused on supporting the work of indie filmmakers around the world. She hopes to foster more inclusivity in both Venezuelan and worldwide films alike. 
Consider watching: “Pelo Malo” (2013)
Mainstream American media often ignores race and sexuality in Latin American and Latinx households. “Pelo Malo,” a coming-of-age story, deals with a young Afro Latino boy in a homophobic household as he dreams of becoming a pop star and struggles to discover his identity. 
Nelson Pereira dos Santos
Often referred to as “the father of Brazilian cinema” due to his involvement in the founding of Cinema Novo — a political film movement focused on social class and racial inequality in Brazil — Nelson Pereira dos Santos’s films were considered very politically radical for their time. After a right-wing regime took over Brazil, he was ordered to not discuss modern politics in his films anymore. However, he continued to make his movies political through symbolism. 
Consider watching: “Rio, 40 Graus” (1955)
“Rio, 40 Graus” ushered in the Cinema Novo movement. Its discussion of race and class in Brazil was so radical, Brazil’s Department of Public Safety banned it for four months. 
Hari Sama
While growing up in Mexico, Hari Sama felt repressed by Mexican society in the 80’s, even describing it as a “dictatorship.” Since then, Sama has used his films to shine a light on underrepresented groups in Mexico, such as the punk movement and the LGBTQ+ community.
Consider watching: “Esto no es Berlín” (2019)
Carlos, feeling as though he does not belong anywhere, discovers the underground punk scene in Mexico where he experiments with his sexuality and discovers the lives of people who also do not fit in with the current societal standards in Mexico. 
Gustavo Taretto
Gustavo Taretto, an Argentinian director, began his career as a photographer but turned to filmmaking. He takes inspiration from his hometown and home country and wants to share his love for them with the world.
Consider watching: “Medianeras” (2011)
“Medianeras” follows the love story of two people struggling with mental health conditions and growing loneliness in Buenos Aires, Argentina. If you are in the mood for a rom-com that still deals with real-world issues, then this is the movie for you.

Secondhand clothing has taken over this generation, as the art — and let’s be real, sport — of finding hidden gems in thrift stores has become a great feat. There’s no greater joy than when you can proudly respond “I thrifted it” to an enthusiastic “Where’d you get your outfit?” 
One great change from past generations is the growing popularity of online reselling, especially through apps such as Depop. While there are small fashion brands who get their start from the app — which was recently bought by Etsy — such as Sarah O Robinson and Fanci Club, many other enthusiastic thrifters and resellers, like Kiko. Vintage and Marigold Touch, got their claim to fame the same way. Even big brands such as Are You Am I, Miaou and House of Sunny are starting to create Depops as a means to increase revenue or hype through exclusive drops or discounted prices for minor misprints. 
I, too, am an avid Depop fan, having purchased some of my most prized wardrobe possessions from the app: my beloved Aunt.Gwen printed skirt, my upcycled Nike sweatshirt corset and the rare “faces” baby tee from Marc Jacobs’ first “Heaven” drop. I have spent hours on the app scouring for the best prices, top sellers and my dream wardrobe pieces, and I know of many others who do the same. I have a friend whose wardrobe is 90% Depop finds, only buying retail for items they absolutely love or require to be new like underwear and bras. 
But, with the expansion of thrifting from a solely physical platform to also a virtual one, came an increase in gatekeeping. In pop culture it means purposely hiding something or a source to keep whatever the item is, whether it is a physical good, a service, or a resource, to yourself so other people can’t access it. It could be you don’t want anyone else to use your tutor’s service so you can keep performing better or their schedule won’t fill up and raise prices, or you don’t want anyone else to know the brand of your skirt so you can be the only person with that skirt. 
Still a little confused? Well, let me give you a scenario:
I saw my sister after school one day and I love the top she’s wearing. I’m not sure if I want to buy one myself but will probably look into it later, if I even remember. I go up to her anyway to ask.
“Hey! I love your top! Where is it from?” 
“Oh it’s thrifted, sorry I don’t know,” she responds.
Hmm, okay, that’s fine. I also have pieces that are thrifted and not tagged. But I also like her skirt, maybe she’ll know that.
“Ugh, so jealous, but I mean your entire outfit is to die for! Where is the skirt from?”
“Like a small boutique, you wouldn’t know it.” 
Another blunt response. 
“What about your shoes? I love the shape of the heel and it seems super comfortable.” My last attempt.
“Umm, I don’t remember sorry.” 
*end scene*
Don’t get me wrong, sometimes people genuinely don’t know where part of their outfit comes from or can’t remember where it was purchased — and that’s fine. But it’s annoying and frustrating when you can tell that their misremembering — or disremembering — is feigned and an attempt to keep the brands and clothing to themselves. Let’s all be real here: Bad acting is an easy tell. 
In the post-coronavirus world of micro-trends, everyone is out and about ready to explore and play with new silhouettes, colors, patterns and styles. We’re all here to explore and uplift each other in our fashion endeavors. As we crusade against fast fashion with conscious consumerism and buying second hand in the hopes of building a more sustainable world, why not kill off that nasty pesticide — gatekeeping — that harms communal growth and love. Without that putrid stench, we can come together, bloom and blossom as we celebrate all brands, big, medium and small. 
And to those who will continue to be gatekeepers? That Oscar isn’t coming anytime soon.

In typical Los Angeles fashion, it’s a hot, sunny day as September comes to an end and a lemonade stand sits squarely in the middle of USC Village. Someone in a tie-dye shirt shouts through a blow horn, “Free lemonade!” But this lemonade stand is far from ordinary.
Jack Murnin, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, is promoting his new single, “Lemonade,” all along the California coast, setting up lemonade stands from Santa Barbara to San Diego.
“We wanted to do something fun, something unique to connect with people [from] different places, so we’ve been coming out to different college campuses and towns [getting] the lemonade stand going,” Murnin said.
 At the USC Village, Murnin’s stand thrives in the heat as a line of students grows down the walkway. “Lemonade” blasts through a speaker on repeat as people flock to the promise of a cold drink, swaying along to the catchy tune as they enjoy lemonade and chat with Murnin about all things music. 
“‘Lemonade’ is a little more laid-back, a little more chill it’s kind of like the next phase of my life,” Murnin said. “That’s what [the song] represents, like going to Southern California … I can’t wait to start my day and sip lemonade.”
Despite growing up in the Bay Area, Jack’s music embodies a beachy, Southern California lifestyle. The music video for “This Youth,” Murnin’s first official release, captures it perfectly. Whether driving down the coast in a convertible, blowing up a bouncy house with a rainbow-dyed dog or running down the street with a guy in a gorilla suit, the video and the song itself is a true summer anthem, intoxicating for listeners as Murnin dances with close friends. 
“We just wanted to get wild with it, kind of like our childhood,” Murnin said. “And [because] I was going off to college, it was a nice send off.”
Interested in music all his life, it wasn’t until high school that Murnin really started making his own independently. With the help of friends who were learning about producing, he became an avid participant in the art of “bedroom pop,” taking pride in starting and finishing a song of his own. 
Murnin’s music hints at a wide variety of genres, touching everything from electro-pop, west coast feel to indie rock with elements of rap. He attributes his inspiration to artists such as Dominic Fike, Brockhampton, Justin Timberlake and Anderson .Paak, due to their “fun, upbeat” nature. 
“It’s very light, very playful,  it just feels like sunshine,” said Benjamin Swayze, a sophomore  who met Murnin in their cinematic communication class. “It’s very windows down, driving down the highway kind of [music].” 
Jack has no shortage of creative ways to shed light on his music, his TikTok account is a lively example of his marketing. Under the pseudonym @lovelydonny, Murnin had fun writing songs for fans in 15 seconds or less, drawing him some attention in the realm of the social media app. 
“I think TikTok is important … I’m gonna try with “Lemonade” to get into it, maybe start a trend,” Murnin said. “That’s how a lot of artists are making their careers.” 
Murnin is not too worried about the pressure of getting one’s music out there too fast. 
“Like everything else I do, it’s super fun but it’s all secondary to me,” Murnin said, emphasizing his prioritization of his music over a speedy viral moment. “[My] number one priority is just to get better.” 
As Murnin remains humble in his pursuits, Emeka Obiorah, a sophomore who helps with the lemonade stands and the promotion of his music, said Murnin’s original concepts and passion for what he does is what makes him unique as an artist. 
“There’s so many people out there [who] release a song and just drop it on Youtube and don’t really do anything,” said Obiorah. “But Jack has ideas, Jack has a whole concept for everything, and he does it. He literally drove down the entire coast … [It’s] absolutely insane and seeing that, I want to support that.” 
Murnin is not worried about the future, as he is in no hurry to rush through making music. With live shows on the horizon, including a performance for Trojan Family Weekend Oct. 7 at 4:30 p.m., the future is bright for Murnin’s musical aspirations. 
“I’ve just been working on a ton of music, always, just trying to improve … I know I have a long way to go,” Murnin said. “I’m definitely not where I want to be, but ‘Lemonade’ is definitely a step in the right direction. I’m just gonna keep pumping stuff out because, why not?”
