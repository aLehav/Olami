The No. 15 USC women’s volleyball team faces a familiar foe this weekend: the road.
Having won only one conference match away from the Galen Center all season, the Women of Troy (17-9, 6-8) are looking to build momentum as they head to Oregon to take on the Ducks and the Beavers in their final Pac-10 road matches of 2009.
Road ahead · Alex Jupiter and USC look to build off their momentum from last week’s wins. - Minnie Jan | Daily Trojan
Trying to build off last weekend’s home wins against then-No. 4 Washington and then-No. 25 Washington State, USC will try to piece together another balanced attack and post a third-straight win in its match against the Ducks (16-8, 6-8) in Eugene, Ore., tonight at 7 p.m.
USC swept Oregon on Oct. 24 at the Galen Center (26-24, 25-23, 30-28), but the Ducks have won two straight over the Women of Troy in Eugene.
The Ducks, coming off losses to No. 7 Stanford and No. 12 Cal last weekend, will look to right their ship behind senior outside hitter Sonja Newcombe and senior setter Nevena Djordjevic. Newcombe leads the team with 360 kills and 239 digs.
USC, however, will look to sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter, who has compiled 413 kills for a 4.39 kills per set average, to cancel out Newcombe’s production.
Djordjevic provides a challenge to the Women of Troy as well. She is second among Pac-10 players with 1,051 assists (12.08 aps).
USC sophomore setter Kendall Bateman, who has racked up 1,150 assists (12.23 aps), will look to lead her team to victory by setting it up with more opportunities to score than Djordjevic.
Although USC looked strong at home last weekend against two tough opponents, USC coach Mick Haley knows his team still has a lot to prove away from the friendly confines of the Galen Center.
“We’re starting to get our confidence back,” Haley said. “Playing at home definitely helps. But winning on the road is essentially the way you get ahead in this conference.”
Following tonight’s contest, the Women of Troy take on the Beavers in Corvallis, Ore. Saturday at 7 p.m.
Oregon State (12-14, 3-11) is one of only three Pac-10 teams not ranked in the top 25, and the Beavers have struggled mightily in the conference thus far.
USC swept Oregon State on Oct. 23 at the Galen Center (25-17, 25-15, 25-22) and leads the all-time series by a 39-8 margin. Additionally, the Women of Troy have won 24 of their past 25 matches against the Beavers.
Oregon State’s biggest strength is its blocking. Averaging 2.9 blocks per set, the Beavers lead the conference in blocks mainly because of to the strong play of senior outside hitter Rachel Rourke and junior outside hitter Jill Sawatzky. Rourke leads her team with 465 kills (4.84 kps), 168 digs (1.75 dps) and 64 blocks. Sawatzky has 304 kills, 246 digs and 57 blocks.
With two tough road matches remaining, the Women of Troy have two more opportunities to show they can win on the road and earn a higher ranking heading into the NCAA Tournament.
“This is a test for us to overcome some pretty good opponents who play well at home,” Haley said. “It’s a challenge to see if we can relax and play up to our level on the road and see if we can get a couple wins.”

More than three years ago, the newest USC men’s water polo team members began their careers with a 10-4 victory over UC Irvine at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The talented freshman class had high aspirations, but it’s unlikely they could have even expected the unrivaled success the Trojans have had these past few years.
Fond memories · Senior driver Matt Sagehorn scored his first goal for the USC men’s water polo team as a freshman against UC Irvine in 2006. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Four seasons, two MPSF titles, a national championship and 83 regular-season wins later, that very same group will be honored as the Trojans close out their regular season against none other than No. 7 UC Irvine at McDonald’s Swim Stadium on Saturday.
The Trojans (21-1, 7-0) will welcome the Anteaters (15-10, 3-4) to McDonald’s for the first time this season, although the two met earlier this year, with the Trojans pulling out an easy victory at the NorCal tournament, 11-4.
The quarterfinal matchup between the two teams was highlighted by the strong play of two from the senior class: driver Matt Sagehorn and two-meter Shea Buckner. The victory also extended the Trojans winning streak against the Anteaters to 14.
Sagehorn, who ranks 15th all-time on the Trojan’s career scoring list, scored his first career goal in that 2006 season-opener against the Anteaters. Sagehorn to reminisce as this matchup brought him full circle.
“It’s been a really great time here, the time has flown by,” Sagehorn said. “I think we’re going to have a good time here at the end of the season on Saturday.”
In the final regular season game for both teams before they compete in the MPSF tournament — scheduled over Thanksgiving weekend — both teams will hope to avoid overlooking this important matchup that is sure to set the tone for an always-intense conference tourney.
“It’s really important to finish the season strong,” Sagehorn said. “We need to keep our focus, and to complete our season on top would be huge for us.”
The Anteaters will bring senior utility man Cole Bielskis, the team’s leading scorer, to penetrate the Trojan defense — which was exposed last weekend against Stanford — and make a final push for the fourth ranking in the MPSF event.
Although this weekend’s game will be the final regular season game played at McDonald’s, the MPSF tournament will be played on USC’s campus, giving the team a certain home-pool advantage.
The extra games will also give the outgoing Trojans a chance to do something extraordinary, to have never lost a single game at home.
“Being at home is always a huge advantage, and we’ve protected our house during my career,” Sagehorn said.
The outgoing class will be honored prior to the game on the pool deck.

The senior had been waiting his whole life for this moment.
Ever since his high school football team lost in the state championship last year, the do-it-all quarterback vowed to win this time around. It was his last season to play with many of his best friends that he had been playing with since middle school, when they made a pact to win the state title.
After a few early hiccups, he led his team through the regular season and into the playoffs. On the way, the three-year phenom established numerous career program records. This season, he passed for more than 1,800 yards, ran for more than 1,200 yards and combined for 35 touchdowns passing and running.
It was his time and destiny to finally win the school’s first football state championship.
But it all came crashing down when, in the game leading up to the playoffs, he was hit on a helmet-to-helmet collision. He got up and couldn’t even read the scoreboard. That’s when he knew he had a concussion.
All week leading up to the first-round playoff game, the quarterback, John Whitelaw, tried to get clearance to play. He saw trainers, concussion specialists and talked with his coach and parents. He had severe headaches that just wouldn’t go away. So Hinsdale Central High School (in Illinois) coach Mike DiMatteo made the decision that some coaches around the country wouldn’t have the guts to make — he sat his starting quarterback.
Only this wasn’t just his starting quarterback. By benching Whitelaw, DiMatteo had essentially sat the entire offense. Sure, there were 10 other starters on the field, but anyone who had watched Whitelaw knew that he was the lifeblood of the offense.
With Whitelaw out, Hinsdale Central never stood a chance against Sandburg High School (also in Illinois). They suffered their worst loss of the season, 35-10, and Whitelaw spent his final high school game on the sidelines.
“It was tough sitting on the sidelines,” Whitelaw said. “After the game I saw all the seniors, and I lost it. It was one of the saddest things I’ve ever experienced.”
His coach felt for him too.
“John’s career never should have ended like that. It’s unfortunate, but, on the other hand, his health has to come first,” DiMatteo said after the game last month. “I feel for him because of everything he’s given our program and of himself. It’s a hard thing as a coach and friend to see that happen, but there’s nothing you can do.”
Even though this happened halfway around the country, there are some important lessons to learn from this. DiMatteo made a decision that’s becoming tougher every day. With college scholarships and state championships on the line, it can sometimes be easy to forget about an athlete’s health.
Yet, DiMatteo and Whitelaw had the ability to see the future and knew that if Whitelaw got hit, his career and even life could have been in jeopardy. But many coaches and players ignore injury, thinking that it’s tough and even heroic to play hurt.
In fact, a study recently conducted by the Associated Press showed that 15 out of the 160 NFL players who responded said they hid or played down symptoms of a concussion.
Players admitted to staying on the field even though they feel concussion symptoms because “it’s what you’re taught,” said Miami Dolphins guard Justin Smiley.
However, coaches have wisened up and have become aware of injuries, frequently holding players out until they are positive it’s safe for them to return. This happened right in our own backyard, on the USC women’s soccer team.
All-American senior defender Meagan Holmes endured a knee injury at the beginning of the season. Even though the makeshift and inexperienced backline was suffering terribly without her, coach Ali Khosroshahin held her out until he knew it was time.
“The first thing that you think about is a player’s health. In conversations with the trainer, doctor and athlete you can just get a feel for it,” said Khosroshahin, who had knee injuries as a player and still feels the effects. “My attitude has changed regarding injuries. I want kids to understand that if they get back before they are ready, there’s a price to pay later. There’s times when I knew I shouldn’t have played, but I did and now I’m paying a price.”
In an age when injuries among youth athletes are more frequent than ever before, it’s refreshing to see coaches not rushing players back onto the field. Too often, coaches, fans and even the players themselves get caught up in the moment and forget about the long-term effects of playing while injured.
But is it really worth the risk of a lifetime of injury for the reward of a state championship trophy? Especially when you’ve been working toward that trophy for five years?
“The doctor told me that if someone whacks me on the helmet, that can cause a coma and death,” Whitelaw said. “I thought one football game wasn’t worth it.”
That’s what it is — just a game.

Kevin O’Neill was content with his debut but wouldn’t stand for his team’s imperfections.
The new head coach of USC men’s basketball made that message loud and clear after earning his first win with the Trojans on Tuesday against UC Riverside. The Trojans’ lead was never threatened, but spurts of sloppy play in the second half marred an otherwise easy victory.

“For the most part we played solid enough basketball to win by 10 points, but we’ve got to play better as time goes on,” O’Neill said after the game.
USC (1-0) will try to clear up those issues when it hosts Loyola Marymount (1-3) Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Galen Center.
The Trojans are still expected to be short-handed with several players sidelined by injuries and eligibility issues. Redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson is battling a knee injury and redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson must sit out Saturday’s game to fulfill an NCAA requirement for playing an exhibition at Connecticut before transferring to USC.
Sophomore forward Leonard Washington and redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity will not be available until the end of the semester.
Sophomore guard Percy “Romeo” Miller will be available to USC after missing the opener because of an NCAA eligibility issue.
Miller’s return could help extend the bench for a team that saw four players play 33 minutes or more in its opener.
“I doubt any of these guys have played these kinds of minutes in their life,” O’Neill said.
The Lions are coming off a season full of turmoil and disappointment with only three wins. Coach Max Good took over for Bill Bayno midway through the season after Bayno had been on an extended medical leave.
But with their four leading scorers returning and four games under their belt already, the Lions may have experience on their side. LMU has kept all three of its losses close, losing by an average of less than four points.
Oregon transfer forward Drew Viney has stood out for the Lions with his early season play. The freshman from Villa Park, Calif., scored 30 points against UC Irvine and 22 points against Montana.
USC has had an overwhelming advantage in its series against LMU, holding a 41-5 all-time record against the Lions. The Trojans hold an eight-game winning streak in the series and have not lost since 1996.

Coming into the third game of the season, sophomore Ashley Corral was charged with the difficult task of leading the USC women’s basketball team to beat her high school rival, Courtney Vandersloot, and the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the USC’s first road game.
It proved too much to handle.
Tough assignment · USC guard Ashley Corral held her formal high school rival, Courtney Vandersloot, to 11 points, but Vandersloot still ran the show, dishing out seven assists. Corral scored a team-high 23 for USC. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy struggled and shot only 29.2 percent from the field in a 70-58 loss to Gonzaga Wednesday night in Spokane, Wash.
Vandersloot scored a modest 11 points on 5 of 10 shooting from the field, but dished out a team-high seven assists to lead her team to victory.
The Trojans couldn’t overcome a 34-21 first-half deficit in their first meeting with Gonzaga in program history.
Corral scored a team-high 23 points and had five steals, but it was the Trojan’s lack of ball sharing that made the game a tough one.
The Bulldogs made 15 assists compared to USC’s five.
Vivian Frieson provided a spark for her team by leading the Bulldogs with a team-high 22 points on 5-10 shooting and nine rebounds.
Same old, same old. Can’t win on the road no matter how good or average the opposition is. Looks like the team will have to wait until the new coaching staff recruits enter the program to see improvement overall.

This story might not be true, but it’s alleged that during the filming of Fitzcarraldo in 1982, the great yet insane Polish actor Klaus Kinski, fed up with months of grueling shooting in the jungles of South America, told his director he was escaping by boat up the Amazon and never looking back.
Werner Herzog, the equally psychotic man behind the camera, produced a revolver and promised Kinski that, by the time he reached the bend in the river, eight bullets would be in his back, with the ninth in Herzog’s temple.
Kinski stayed, and together they finished one of Herzog’s finest films. So arised one of the greatest cinematic partnerships of the past 40 years.
Herzog is cinema’s illustrious madman, a poet obsessed with the nature of obsession itself. His career began four decades ago and has been marked by some of the most beautiful and troubling films — both fiction and documentary — ever made.
Herzog’s latest is Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, a quasi-remake of Abel Ferrara’s infamous mid-’90s character study, Bad Lieutenant. The generally understated Harvey Keitel has been swapped out in favor of the off-the-deep-end Nicolas Cage, for whom the word subdued carries no meaning.
Cage might be just the actor Herzog has been searching for ever since he and Kinski suffered a falling out in 1987. Herzog’s five-film partnership with Kinski, which defined the German cinema of the ‘70s and ‘80s, was successful because their egos joined together in a chaotic harmony.
It’s possible Herzog saw in Cage an obsession and compulsiveness that Christian Bale, the star of Herzog’s recent Rescue Dawn, could never achieve. From great performances in films like Adaptation to awful roles in a hilarious The Wicker Man, Cage still seems to be stuck in the wild-eyed, strung-out alcoholic role in Leaving Las Vegas that won him an Oscar. It makes him a strange man to watch on screen, but in the right role — such as the drug-addicted, morally bankrupt star of Herzog’s latest film — he exudes an utterly captivating energy.
Herzog has apparently again found his muse, the mirror onto which he can cast his obsessions and obsessive nature. Herzog is such a fascinating figure because his films are deeply personal expressions of the inner workings of his mind. Listen to him argue with a dead man in his great Grizzly Man as his narration openly contradicts the philosophies of his deceased subject.
Or watch 2007’s Encounters at the End of the World — a film whose title carries a dark double meaning — to bask in Herzog’s awe in the face of nature and his terror at the smallest sign of its man-made destruction. Herzog’s films are always about the same obsession that grips him as an artist, and he is never afraid to let his audience know it.
In his quest to make films true to his spirit, Herzog’s documentaries, which have defined the latter half of his career far more than his few fiction films of the period, are fundamentally and openly dishonest in method. When making Little Dieter Needs to Fly — the documentary that inspired his Rescue Dawn — he would try and frighten his jumpy Vietnam veteran subject before takes to achieve more realistic emotion. Herzog, the consummate self-aware artist, has addressed criticisms of his merits as a documentarian with openness and a mild flippancy.
Herzog’s attitude, outspokenness and tendency toward exaggeration for dramatic effect are all the marks of a great storyteller with a self-assured hand. Really, Herzog’s appeal is in his personality. No filmmaker of his generation possesses the same unique nature as Herzog, and the stories of his life are just as interesting as many of his films.
Some of those tales are hidden, while others are documented. Required viewing for both Herzog-enthusiasts and anyone aspiring to become an artist are three documentaries about Herzog and his process: My Best Fiend, which catalogues Herzog’s relationship with Kinski, Burden of Dreams, about the making of Fitzcarraldo, and the self-explanatory Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe, made after Herzog bet a young Errol Morris Herzog would never complete his first, best film, The Thin Blue Line.
The legends about Werner Herzog are reminiscent of Fritz Lang, another legendary German director obsessed with the workings of his own mind. Lang was the man behind the cinema’s greatest legend: After Joseph Goebbels offered him to head of the Nazi film industry in 1933, Lang fled the same night to Paris. That story is mostly untrue, fabricated by one of the cinema’s great storytellers to resemble the plot of one of his films.
Gene Siskel once said — as Roger Ebert has endlessly repeated — that no film should be less interesting than a documentary of the filmmakers having lunch.
The best thing about the canon of Herzog — and of course, not all of his films are great — is the way in which his personality bleeds through the screen so vibrantly. Watching a Herzog film is like having an intimate lunch with him — few other filmmakers could stand up to such a claim.

Few bands have the extensive résumé and indie credibility of Swedish pop-rock group Peter Bjorn and John. Even fewer bands in the current music industry have careers that span over more than a decade.
But for this pop-rock power trio, who hit their 10-year anniversary as a band this week, their music is still as fresh as it was a decade ago.

Although based in Stockholm, PBJ reached the height of its popularity in America for its whistle-happy 2006 single, “Young Folks.”
Björn Yttling, bassist, keyboardist and vocalist of the band, referred to “Young Folks” as “a very catchy tune that we never get tired of playing; our own version of ‘Jailhouse Rock.’”
In addition to its single, the highly melodic pop trio has five full-length albums. Living Thing, the group’s newest album that was released in early 2009, was eclectic enough to win back all of the die-hard fans that had temporarily strayed away after the unprecedented success of “Young Folks” and still managed to acquire a new following as well.
PBJ’s music is a combination of toe-tapping electro-pop with a noisy experimental rock cooked in an expensive imported oven. Their inspiration comes from many artists who would not mix well together, although you can easily hear a little bit of each of in PBJ’s songs. The dissonance of My Bloody Valentine combined with the classic rock of The Cure and the pure melodic mastery of Paul McCartney come together in the songs. Or, in Yttling’s words, “[the group’s] inspirations are dancey, noisy and melodic.”
All of these artists had the chance to share a stage with Peter Bjorn and John last April during the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This year, PBJ got to play on the main stage on April 19, the third day of the festival. As the sun started to set, the trio picked up their instruments and went straight into an upbeat and energized set.
“We actually prefer to play in the tent, just because we can feel the [energy from the] public,” Yttling said when asked about which Coachella appearance had been more fulfilling for the band, who also played the 2007 festival.
Peter Bjorn and John is not the only successful indie band to hail from Sweden in recent years. Other great bands that this snowy Scandinavian nation has given the world include Miike Snow, A Camp, I’m from Barcelona, Suburban Kids with Biblical Names and Lykke Li, among many more. El Perro Del Mar, another band from Sweden led by Sarah Assbring, is responsible for opening for Peter Bjorn and John during its current tour.
The band is playing shows throughout the United States celebrating 10 years of a very fruitful musical career. A career full of very interesting highlights and, without a doubt, very interesting music.
“I am glad I became a musician instead of a cab driver, only because I could not get my driving license in Stockholm,” Yttling laughs.
The US Birthday Tour kicked off early this month and ends in Los Angeles on Saturday, on the band’s anniversary date. Saturday’s highly anticipated performance will take place in the cozy Club Nokia, at LA Live. El Perro Del Mar will be accompanied by San Diego band Lights On as openers.
Though Yttling remains secretive about Saturday’s show, he hints that concertgoers should plan for the unexpected.
“People should expect many surprises for the show,” Yttling said. “In New York we had Amanda Blank and Andrew WK come up on stage with us, but for the LA show we are having even bigger surprises.”

Take an eccentric director, add an eccentric star, and what’s the outcome?
A truly bizarre film.
In Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, the combination of Werner Herzog’s zany, metaphor-rich directing and Nicolas Cage’s over-exaggerated characterization produces a ludicrous yet somewhat fascinating film that both entices and befuddles the audience.
Bad cop · In Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, Nicholas Cage (right) plays a homicide detective who busts druggies to satisfy his own growing addictions. The film is set in post-Katrina New Orleans. - Photos courtesy of First Look Pictures
Love or hate him, Cage is a perfect fit to play Terence McDonagh — a New Orleans-based homicide detective who busts druggies to satisfy his own personal addiction. After permanently injuring his back while trying to save an inmate, he becomes hooked on his Vicodin prescription, and later succumbs to more destructive drugs like cocaine and heroine.
This addiction leads him to gamble excessively, provide coke for his prostitute girlfriend (Eva Mendes), steal drugs from both junkie couples and the police department and eventually ally with the very same homicidal narcotics-dealing gang he is investigating.
It is important to note that although this film shares the title of the 1992 Abel Ferrara cult classic, it is not a remake at all. The only common theme is that there is a bad cop involved. In fact, Herzog did not even want to share the same title, and only agreed to do so after the producers accepted his suggestion to make the title more specific: Port of Call New Orleans.
As the title implies, the scene is set in post-Katrina New Orleans, at a time when there is an obvious breakdown of civil order and morality. Unlike the 1992 character in Ferrara’s film, McDonagh never shows much remorse or guilt over his actions. There is no reference to any religion except for some Virgin Mary statues in the background and redemption is elusive.
Instead, the film portrays the collapse of morality, and provides a grim view on how absolutely base and vile a human being can become. Given Herzog’s cynical view on humanity, this depressing outlook is hardly surprising.
The ongoing harrowing plot — McDonagh being suspended from his work, almost losing his girlfriend, being thousands of dollars in debt because of gambling — seems secondary to the visible downward spiral of Terence’s morality.
At one point, he tries to blackmail a football star to throw  a game so he can win his bet; in another scene, he turns a gun upon two sweet elderly women and screams, “You are the fucking reason why this country’s going down the drain!”
Indeed, this film is full of loopy ironies and extremities. And perhaps this is why Cage seems entirely comfortable in his role here.
Throughout the whole movie, one word comes to mind: ugly. Terence is not a pretty sight; he glowers like a bulldog, with a ridiculously long gun stuck down the front of his pants; he snorts coke in almost every scene; his eyes are sunken and dark with sleep deprivation; and his gaze is intense, piercing and maniacal.
Cage has never looked so hideous, yet he plays it well in character. He manages to keep up his stiff-board walk and slouched back even when he is running up the stairs, and his emotions are clearly displayed with every twitch on his face. He doesn’t want or need your pity; he knows he’s depraved, but he doesn’t care as long as he gets his fix.
Herzog adds another dimension to this play of absurdities with his characteristic enigmatic metaphors and exaggerated use of animals. In one scene, there is an awkwardly long shot of two Iguanas — filmed shakily with a handheld camera — to the song “Please Release Me.”
In another, the soul of a dead gangster break dances. The ending is just as baffling — Terence sits in front of a giant fish tank with the very same inmate he rescued years ago, and his last words are, “Do fish have dreams?”
If you’re looking for a lighthearted movie, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans is not for you. This is one highly entertaining film that will make you laugh, gape and squirm at the preposterousness of it all, but you will also leave feeling highly disturbed, puzzled and delusional.
But perhaps that is just what Herzog wanted — a film with a visual image and emotional sensation so strong and loony that it lingers in your mind.

Here is an important message most women in America have heard for the majority of their lives: Get mammograms every one to two years in order to detect any possible abnormalities in breast tissue that could lead to cancer.
That dependable creed, however, has been shattered by a recent recommendation by the US Preventive Services Task Force.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
On Monday the USPSTF announced that women under the age of 50 do not require regular breast exams, and that only women between the ages of 50 and 75 should be checked once every two years.
The report also stated that there is not sufficient evidence to give counsel to women over the age of 75 (you know, because they’re going to die soon anyway). The panel also parlously recommended against self-examination, giving the weak excuse that teaching women to check themselves won’t ultimately save lives.
Not surprisingly, the announcement has been met with outrage and protests from patients and doctors alike.
After all, women in their 40s, who are now being told they do not require regular exams, account for at least a quarter of breast cancer diagnoses.
The task force has announced that they have no plans to adjust their guidelines any time soon.
After re-evaluating scientific research on the overall success of mammography in preventing breast cancer-related deaths, the USPSTF has decided that women should consult a physician if they are concerned about their vulnerability to cancer and make a decision accordingly about how often they should be tested.
The recommendation does not apply to women at high risk for the disease, who should still be tested once a year.
One would think that protecting the lives and well-being of American women would be an important focus of a government department dedicated to preventing diseases. In fact, it ought to be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, Americans are having to fight their leaders in order to defend their own health.
Health insurance companies are probably celebrating with champagne right now, because they have yet another physical expense to cross off their list of covered services.
No doubt many were vying for a less expensive “recommendation” to be set in place, as seems to be the current trend in American health care. If a procedure will take considerable time or money — in this case, anywhere between $80 and $200 without insurance — those in charge would prefer to sidestep it altogether. Only if a doctor deems a mammogram absolutely necessary will they recommend that a woman be regularly examined.
This new ordinance could prove to be disastrous to women’s health. We have made substantial advances in detecting breast cancer early on with the use of regular mammogram examinations. In fact, the mortality rate for breast cancer has dropped 30 percent since 1990.
Thankfully, some insurance companies and Medicare administrators — who usually follow the task force’s guidelines closely — are choosing to continue to pay for the procedure, although it is unclear how long they will be able to resist the health panel.
So what happens when mammograms are pushed aside by health care leaders, dismissed as an unnecessary form of self-maintenance? The health of the general public will be at stake.
It is unacceptable for mammograms to be demoted to the same health plane as herbal supplements. Why would women voluntarily schedule those uncomfortable appointments that require their breasts to be pulled, pressed and scanned when they are not even endorsed by health care officials?
Granted, mammogram exams are not perfect. While they indisputably help save lives, they are not 100 percent reliable.
Nevertheless, more than 192,000 new cases of breast cancer are expected in the United States this year, along with 40,000 deaths. Early detection is the best way to prevent these fatalities.
We should be focusing on perfecting mammogram technology, not scrutinizing its obvious worth. It is irresponsible to give women conflicting messages that could endanger their lives.
Amy Baack is a senior majoring in cinema-television production.
The federal government is interested in cutting costs, not in saving lives.  Preventative medicine like mammograms challenges this goal in two ways.  First, preventative medicine costs money.  Second, it saves lives.  If you’re Barack Obama or Kathleen Sebelius, and your goal is to funnel as much taxpayer money to abortions as possible, then you’d rather have a lot of dead middle aged women than a lot of old ladies needing money from Medicare for doctor visits, prescriptions, and those electric scooters you see on the commercials.
So it’s time for us to all bend over and get ready for Obamacare.
Get ready for Obama Care!
Cutting the number of tests is one way to cut costs. Our president has spent many prepared speeches decrying the over testing in the health care system. If the voters are ready to hand over health care responsibility to the federal government, we will have less access to tests. We may have limits so low that we’ll have waiting periods – even if you are willing to pay out of pocket. Witness both the British and Canadian health care systems (our president has praised both).  The benefit of fewer tests is two fold, lower up front costs, and lower costs to age based federal welfare programs (Social Security and Medicare). We can lobby for free health care, but the costs will arise, if not in monetary means, then in loss of life, or in quality of life,
“One would think that protecting the lives and well-being of American women would be an important focus of a government department dedicated to preventing diseases. In fact, it ought to be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, Americans are having to fight their leaders in order to defend their own health.”
This is a terrible straw-man argument. Here is the group’s stated position on why they choose the new recommendations, from the New York Times article about it (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/health/17cancer.html?partner=rss&emc=rss):
“Dr. Diana Petitti, vice chairwoman of the task force and a professor of biomedical informatics at Arizona State University, said the guidelines were based on new data and analyses and were aimed at reducing the potential harm from overscreening.
While many women do not think a screening test can be harmful, medical experts say the risks are real. A test can trigger unnecessary further tests, like biopsies, that can create extreme anxiety. And mammograms can find cancers that grow so slowly that they never would be noticed in a woman’s lifetime, resulting in unnecessary treatment.”
You managed to completely ignore the rationale behind the decision, and instead choose to attack it with equivocations like “it is unacceptable for mammograms to be demoted to the same health plane as herbal supplements”. Furthermore, you then insinuated that protecting the “lives and well-being of American women” is not an important focus of the group, even though the guidelines are specifically intended to do just that.
You wasted an opportunity with this piece to do some real research and public education about over-testing and over-treatment in medicine. Increases in testing have of course led to greater diagnosis and successful treatment of cancers, but the dark side is that it is indeed possible to test too much, to the point that the risks associated with testing outweigh the benefits. I wish you had taken the opportunity to explain that concept as a counterpoint to your strong feelings on the subject, instead of writing such a one-sided piece.

With Gov. Schwarzenegger’s second term about to wrap up, several names have begun to surface as his possible replacement, with California Attorney General Jerry Brown and eBay CEO Meg Whitman currently leading the polls. The campaign has yet to hit its stride, but with the financial disarray that California has been stewing in, the race will prove to be heated.
If either of these candidates is going to convince California they’re the right person to get the state out of its jam, they’ll have to prove they’re not reading from the same book as previous California leaders — the fictional antithesis to Stephen R. Covey’s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. The Seven Habits of Highly Ineffective governors are as follows, with apologies to Covey:
1. Be reactive
Deal with problems now, and let the future handle itself. If the state is going to face a $26.3 billion deficit, make plenty of stopgap measures that will solve the deficit now but will leave the state with a $20.8 billion deficit the following year. If worse comes to worst, income withholding and taxes can always increase. After all, budget deficits are part of the norm for California. In 2008, the state faced a $16 billion deficit, and in 2003 — under former Gov. Gray Davis — the state faced a $10 billion deficit. It’s the same problem every year, just never solved.
2. Neglect the implications of your decisions
If you’re good at No. 1, this should be no problem. Always make sure you’re spending. Recall that Davis had the luxury of a surplus in the late ’90s and spent heavily to continue building California. Davis’ real innovation came when the state lost revenue after getting hit by the dot-com bubble in 2000. The state legislature and the governor continued to spend. This left California in an inopportune position when the electricity crisis hit the following year.
3. Push things off until later
Procrastination is a staple of California politics. Take note of the water bill recently signed by Schwarzenegger to upgrade California’s ancient water system and its policies, pledging to fund the project with an $11.1 billion bond. In typical California fashion, the state waited decades until it was forced to attempt to fix the insipid issue, leaving Central Valley farmers to wonder if their farms could manage until the implementations take place. Ongoing droughts have left 500,000 unplanted. Another drought next year, and the farmers might be done for. That’s the sign that you can finally do something to help them.
4. Think lose/lose
The governor of California faces relentless pressure from Democrats to raise taxes and unanimous opposition from Republicans against it. Don’t bother mediating the parties. That will translate to another round of nasty spending cuts for programs Democrats support.
5. Appeal to every faction and then disappoint each one
A recent Los Angeles Times/USC poll showed Californians hold very little in common in terms of their political perspectives, besides their disdain for the state’s current direction. They each think everyone else is wrong. Your job is to “microtarget” by appealing to every one of these political segments, that way you can please hardly anyone and anger practically everyone at the same time.
6. Practice convolution
Arguments between the legislative and executive branch can always be handled by one word: veto. Budget cuts not up to snuff? Veto. Proposed panel to draft a finance reform bill not working? Veto. Don’t want to help finance San Francisco’s waterfront projects? Veto, with an emphasis. That same veto came with Schwarzenegger’s now infamous four-letter message hidden in the first word of every line. It might have been a coincidence, but doesn’t vetoing everything that comes from legislation send the exact same message?
7. Sharpen the sword
How you handle criticism as a politician is often more important than the actual bill you help pass. If lawmakers are having trouble passing a budget because you think they’re catering to special interests, badmouth them until you get your way. Try calling them girlie men, and if that doesn’t work, send them a sculpture of brass bull balls to get your message across. Certainly it’s a little childish, but that’s politics.
Ultimately, it’s obvious California needs more consistency out of its leaders. If California hopes to escape the same type of problems that have been following it throughout the past decade, the first step it needs to take is to elect a governor who’s following a different script.
Robert Fragoza is a junior majoring in chemical engineering. His column, “Reality Check,” runs Fridays.
The governor could have gone  along way to solving the state’s problems by Vetoing everything that came to his desk. Not one new law cuts spending or reduces services. He could have saved piles of money by leaving unfilled all the political appointees and suspending the boards that go along with them. He could end the vehicle and gasoline subsidies of state employees and elected officials. He could limit end of budget year spending – every state entity has money left over in the last month of the budget and they all blow it. Just giving a paid vacation to everyone for the last month of the fiscal year with no notice would save BILLIONS.
Oh boo. It didn’t include my picture. This graph (check us out on the bottom) illustrates just how insane our state legislators are, and how little hope of common ground there is:
http://home.uchicago.edu/~bshor/research/votesmart/npat_boxplot_states_parties_mcmc.png
I’m with ya, but as inept as our Governator is, you have to admit that our system is built for deadlock.
 – First, it takes 2/3 of our insanely polarized legislature to pass a budget. We have literally the most liberal and most conservative state senators in the country here in CA:
So, every year is going to be a massive struggle while Democrats push for massive, irresponsible expansion of services while the Republicans refuse to raise a single penny in taxes.
– Second, since it also takes 2/3 to raise a tax, anything but a massive Dem majority makes it impossible to increase revenue.
SO! Then we send it to the people. Since it only takes 50% for a referendum to pass a new tax, we let the people decide.
Guess what we’re really good at: Voting for new services, and not for new taxes. We’ve taken away any potential for our representatives to solve problems, leaving it to us to be fiscally irresponsible.
IIRC, we are the only state with this double-2/3 problem. I fear that our state is inherently ungovernable, even by the most capable governor we could possibly send to Sacramento.

Everyone looking forward to blowing off some pre-finals steam by sprinting through campus wearing very little clothing will have to wait another semester.
This semester, three students undertook bringing a UCLA campus tradition — the Undie Run — to USC. But organizers decided to delay the inaugural run after realizing the amount of work and resources necessary to coordinate the event.
Jeremy Schwartz, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said safety concerns, combined with a lack of time to plan for the different safety measures needed — including janitorial services, Department of Public Safety officers and medical personnel — forced him to postpone.
“At first it was devastating, but now I look at it as a great opportunity to make next semester’s Undie Run even better and work with the school to make this a truly amazing charity event,” Schwartz said.
Some students complained that DPS had forced the cancellation of the Undie Run, but DPS Capt. David Carlisle said DPS was concerned about safety, though, it did not actually cancel the event.
Carlisle said concerns were raised by a Los Angeles Times article this summer about UCLA’s Undie Run.
“According to the article, they had eight to ten thousand participants, many of whom were not affiliated with the university,” Carlisle said. “They cited injuries, vandalism, drunkenness and fights as problems that had become unmanageable.”
Still, DPS did not make the official postponement decision; it simply advised the organizers of the resources needed for such an event.
Carlisle noted, however, that DPS does not condone the Undie Run.
“It is not something I would be proud of as a USC parent,” Carlisle said.
Schwartz said he does not think USC’s Undie Run will get out of hand, but he and the other organizers will be working with the administration to ensure proper measures are taken if the event does take place.
“Currently, we are working through Student Affairs to plan the event. We will coordinate more closely with DPS as we near the event date next spring,” Schwartz said.
Carlisle said he wondered why USC students would want to copy an event done by the school’s cross-town rivals.
“I wouldn’t think holding an event that originated with our friends across town in Westwood would be something we would want to add as an ’SC ‘tradition,’” Carlisle said. “We already have the Fountain Run, do we really need to copy the Bruins?”
But Schwartz and co-organizers Klarisse Jison, a sophomore majoring in international relations, and Connor Douglass, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said USC’s event will be different, as it will benefit charity — all clothes shed before the run will be donated to two teen shelters: Covenant House California and My Friend’s Place.
Though organizers are optimistic the run will happen next semester, some students are disappointed that they will have to wait.
“I don’t understand why it had to be postponed,” said Tyler Vestal, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “Every school in the Pac-10 has one, and I was really looking forward to it. Luckily postponing it will not affect my attendance, but I just hope it happens next semester.”
The new date for the Undie Run has not yet been decided.
Hey, who splattered the bRuin bear with red and yellow paint last night?
We got to win first, then celebrate…Don’t count your chickens before the eggs hatch.
As a USC alumn, I would be extremely disappointed if our school decided to copy some lame FUCLA tradition. We have so many better traditions than them, why the need to be like them?
yawn
All other schools have undie runs too.  I don’t think the intention for USC’s undie run was to copy UCLA
Wait, why are yall copying the Bruins? Can’t you think of something more creative or original….
Isn’t this a bruin thing.  How about a little creativity.
That’s what I’m saying. UCLA ended their undie-run anyways.
Maybe if you organized the run as a fund raiser to end global warming it may actually work

The Los Angeles Police Department took a slightly different approach to Wednesday’s traffic enforcement operation near USC’s campus than it took during its September effort.
At least six LAPD officers were patrolling Jefferson Boulevard throughout the day, rather than staking out the intersections of McClintock Avenue and Hoover Street, as they did last time and initially said they would this time.
Some students who biked through the designated intersections said they didn’t see much change in behavior.
“I biked across Hoover a bunch of times today and didn’t see anyone,” said Andrea Santos, a junior majoring in theatre. “People were biking across the whole time and usually when someone sees LAPD there’s a chain reaction and everyone gets off their bike.”
By noon, LAPD had issued just 15 citations, according to Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle. During the September enforcement effort, LAPD issued a total of 120 citations.
Carlisle said when he visited the intersection of Jefferson and Hoover there were four LAPD officers, and he noticed students complying with the posted road signs.
“I saw lots of students walking their bikes,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle said LAPD reported that it noticed many motor vehicles failing to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk, and it plans to return Thursday to address the issue.
“It appears they will be back tomorrow to monitor areas such as Hoover and 28th [Street] and Hoover and Adams [Boulevard] because of the number of vehicles ignoring pedestrians in crosswalks,” Carlisle said.
Those bike cops should just be there enforcing traffic regs, not ridiculous nonsense rules (I’ve gotten THREE tickets at Hoover and Jefferson for not having a front license plate because my car doesn’t have anyplace to put one!).
In addition to the increased enforcement for safety concerns regarding bike laws, I would like to see the patrol officers start to cite vehicles for excessive noise from boom stereos and modified exhaust systems. This can sometimes be a safety issue as well but just as importantly, it is a quality of life issue (it can also be a revenue generator for city). More and more inconsiderate drivers pollute the air with their sonic assault. I have seen police motorcycle and patrol officers ignore vehicles with a painfully loud bass signal blasted practically right next to them. Enforcement in this regard is pretty much toothless.
you know what I do when i see a car roll by with loud music? – I put down my pants and dance to the tune. nobody wants to see my ugly ass!

Student leaders from across campus met under the Undergraduate Student Government banner Wednesday night at USG’s first Council of Presidents, an event bringing together executive officers from campus organizations for collaboration, networking and a chance to voice their concerns to USG.
Named for the event’s goal — to provide a forum for the presidents of student organizations to meet and share their ideas — the Council of Presidents hosted representatives from 70 different student organizations and featured presentations from USG’s six advocacy directors, USG President Holden Slusher and USG Vice President Ashlie Chan. About 100 student leaders attended and were given feedback forms to fill out over the course of the night.

“It’s letting them know what we’re doing, but the equally important half is them letting us know what they want to see,” said Chris Cheng, director of outreach for USG. “We believe our changes are great, but this organization represents the student body at large, and we want their input. We seek that in order to make our ideas better.”
Aside from giving student leaders information about USG’s current and future projects and soliciting their input, the event also highlighted what the USC Master Plan has in store for the university, with a presentation by Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president of real estate and asset management at USC.
Although the Council of Presidents is the first event of its kind in recent USG history, the idea of uniting presidents from every student organization under one roof is not new to USC.
In the 1940s, USG’s Senate was comprised of all the presidents of USC’s student organizations. Once that practice was discontinued, USG administrations continued to host forums similar to the Council of Presidents until 2000, Slusher said.
After learning about this piece of USG history from a former president of the organization, Slusher said he wanted to bring the student leader forum back to USC.
“It’s one of those events where you don’t know what’s going to happen, but we’re going to get information to them, and they’re going to give us feedback, and anything else that happens is kind of a perk,” he said.
Many student leaders who attended the event said the Council of Presidents was an opportunity for them to learn about other campus organizations and to make themselves available as resources for other student leaders.
“There are a lot of organizations on campus, and this gives them a chance to meet each other,” said Eric Stein, president of the SCuba Knights and a sophomore majoring in economics. “We are the Trojan Family, so we should work together,”
Lisa Robinson, president of Society 53 and a senior majoring in communication, said the event gave student leaders a chance to act as a support system and brainstorming mechanism for each other.
“As student leaders, a lot of us go through the same things. We’re learning how to lead organizations and deal with a lot of people,” she said. “It’s a great opportunity for us to bounce strategies off each other and partner to see how we can serve USC better.”
Blessing Waung, president of the Panhellenic Council and a senior majoring in print journalism and East Asian languages and cultures, said the event was a valuable resource, and she hopes USG will continue to host it in the future to give student leaders the support they need.
“I’m coming to the end of my term, while some people may be in the middle of theirs or just beginning,” Waung said. “Being able to talk to someone about what worked and what didn’t work would have been nice to have when I was starting out … but hopefully now I can provide that for others.”
USG spent $1,300 to host the Council of Presidents and hopes to give the event and its budget the chance to grow if it becomes a staple, Cheng said.
“This is kind of our test run, and we’ll have to step up to bat and see how it goes,” he said. “We’re really feeling the mover-and-shaker ideas [happening] at the Council of Presidents among the student leaders. Hopefully they feel like it’s an official event they’ll want to come back to.”
David Hsu, vice chair for Webb Tower Building Government and a sophomore majoring in health administration, said he would attend the Council of Presidents again if USG continued to host it and that the presentations gave him much-needed information he would not have learned otherwise.
“It was actually very interesting,” Hsu said. “We found out a lot about what they’re doing, which is really great because a lot of students don’t know.”
As an alumnus, I am encouraged and excited to hear about this occuring. Well done.

For America’s largest universities, achieving a nutritiously balanced campus is a lot harder than it looks. With each student comes a different set of eating habits, and on campuses as large and diverse as USC’s, reaching a consensus on dining options is virtually impossible. Add to the equation all the national fast food titans vying for the stomachs of hungry students, and you get quite a messy issue.
At USC, the nutrition dilemma is as long standing as it is impassable. Students, administrators and campus health experts each have their views, but material progress is hard to come by.
John Baldo, director of student affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government, said the problem is that when it comes to nutrition, the student voice is unclear. Some are committed to sticking with healthy food, but many more still form long, snaking lines at the  fast food joints on campus.
“Most people are saying they want the burgers and fries. They like that stuff,” Baldo said. “But we also hear very regularly from vegetarians and people around campus that want healthier options.”
Baldo admits providing healthy options on campus is a challenge because a large portion of students still show that they want fast food.
In October, USG asked about 2,000 students which dining options they would most like to see in the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
According to the survey, the most popular choice, with 1,427 votes, was California Pizza Kitchen, and the second-most popular option, with 1,060 votes, was Panda Express. Wolfgang Puck and Baja Fresh were the third- and fourth-most popular choices.
Vegetarian options like Veggie Grill were also on the survey, but that restaurant received far fewer votes.
In the space where students could write in their own suggestions, the most common requests were In-N-Out and Chipotle, though a few students said simply, “anything healthy.”
“We try to offer what they’re looking for, but if it’s not selling then we will replace that with what the students will buy,” said Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality. “The students speak with their spending habits.”
Even at campus restaurants that offer some healthy items, like Baja Fresh, experts say students are ordering the least healthy options.
“Baja Fresh has a wonderful menu selection. But if you go to the most popular item, the Baja favorites are quesadillas and burritos. They are over 1,000 calories,” said Roger Clemens, a professor in the School of Pharmacy and an expert in food, medicine and health. “We could put away 4,000 to 5,000 calories in one sitting.”
Students admit that ordering nutritious food sounds ideal, but that it is not necessarily realistic.
“It’s hard to resist the temptation to get something not healthy,” said Nam Nguyen, a freshman majoring in international relations. “I try to eat fruits and vegetables every day but that’s as far as I go with nutrition.”
USC Hospitality is posed with the problem of providing nutritious options for students, realizing the importance of a healthy diet, yet knowing that they need to provide what will sell.
“It’s really a challenge to be on a university campus when you have a food establishment,” Clemens said. “It’s also a business. On one side you provide food that students will eat and you support your business, or you provide more healthy choices that students won’t eat.”
Still, the community of medical experts on campus agrees proper nutrition is a vital part of the academic life and cannot be ignored.
“Eating well is essential to focus and concentration,” said Patrice Barber, a registered dietitian at the University Park Health Center. “It is important for students to eat well for health but also for the academic part.”
And what raises the stakes of campus nutrition even more is the fact that, off campus, fast food is virtually the only choice for immobile students.
“There aren’t really nutritious options. It would be nice if there was a health food store somewhere like a Trader Joe’s or something,” said Makena Hudson, an undeclared freshman.
Students have found their own ways to eat healthy by forgoing campus dining, but other students say they have pretty much given up.
“It’s pretty difficult when your choices are primarily fast food restaurants,” said Jonathan Choi, a sophomore majoring in public policy, management and planning. “We don’t really have a healthy alternative.”
However, USC Hospitality said it is providing students with plenty of vegetarian, vegan and healthy options at a number of different food venues and they are always looking to improve.
“Literatea and The Lot have quite a few healthy options and alternatives. There are vegan sandwiches and so on,” Klinger said. “But we are looking at ways to even improve on that.”
Students continue to complain about nutrition but nothing seems to be changing. And the reason for that, some say, seems to amount to a classic disagreement between wellness and commerce.
Clemens said the only thing to do is have students speak up and demand better nutrition.
“If the students demand better nutrition, companies would be forced to provide better products, because they want the business,” Clemens said. “What determines that is the students [being] willing to change a lifestyle.”
Please, no franchised restaurants!!!
How about some good ‘ol fashioned mom and pop ethnic restaurants?
Bring Veggie Grill to USC!!!  They have the best vegan meals — even carnivores like them!
Also, there are weekly farmers markets that come near campus: http://wellness.usc.edu/2009/02/trojan-fresh-market-1.html,  as well as one that comes on campus every month or two.  It would be great if it could come more often!
Panera Bread !!!!!!!!

Situated two miles away from the heart of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County and USC County Hospital serves a population of about 1.2 million people by providing different kinds of medical care, from surgery to psychiatry.
USC became involved with the hospital in 1885 by allowing medical students to complete their residency there. According to the LAC+USC County Hospital website, there are currently 1,600 volunteer physicians, 450 staff physicians and more than 900 residents from all over the country, as well as 600 medical students. The hospital serves all kinds of people, from law enforcement officers to typical civilians.
However, despite the state-of-the-art facility and various medical professionals, the hospital faces an underlying problem. Since the mid ’90s, the LAC+USC County Hospital has been struggling with overcrowding and long wait times in the emergency room. On a typical day, the ER has 80 to 100 people waiting an average of 10 hours each.
“It is rare to see the LAC+USC county hospital waiting room not full,” said Roxane Marquez, the senior press deputy to County Supervisor Gloria Molina. “It has been notoriously crowded for decades.”
A debate on the hospital board during the mid ’90s over how many beds should be available in the ER left Molina feeling “disheartened,” because she predicted that the hospital would be crowded from the day it opened, Marquez said.
Although Molina lobbied for 750 beds to be available to ER patients, the hospital board ended up deciding that 600 beds would be enough, based on recommendations from experts. At the time of the decision, around 20 emergency rooms were in operation. Since then, they have all closed down.
“The ER used to be even smaller,” said Walavan Sivakumar, a senior in the USC medical program who is completing his residency at the LAC+USC County Hospital. “A lot of the ERs in the city are not able to function and [are] closing down, so that increases the traffic, especially of those that are uninsured or underinsured and don’t have the flexibility to go to a private hospital. More and more patients are relying completely on the LAC+USC County Hospital.”
Because the hospital is constantly overcrowded, LAC+USC County Hospital has resorted to diverting patients to private hospitals or to Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center.
Recently, the board has also been looking into re-opening the Martin Luther King Hospital. A vote on this will take place today.
“Re-opening MLK Hospital will relieve pressure on all the hospitals in the LA area,” said Aurelio Rojas, communications director for Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. “If the vote passes, the hospital should be up and going by 2013.”
MLK Hospital was closed in 2007 because of poor management. Supervisors did not “have any faith that it could be turned around,” Marquez said. It is currently operating as an urgent care clinic and an outpatient ambulatory care service.
Marquez also mentioned that the new US health policy reform will help by allowing more people to purchase health insurance, which will give them more opportunity to receive treatment from other hospitals.
Because of the long wait hours, many patients end up leaving the ER because they cannot afford to wait for that long. LAC+USC County Hospital has implemented a protocol that transfers patients to other hospitals once they have been waiting for 11 hours.
“Nobody wants to see people waiting in the ER for a ridiculous amount of hours,” Marquez said. “It was instrumental not only to bring them a first-class hospital with regards to amenities — the quality of bed, instruments, etc. — but to do something about the wait time.”
Fred Leaf, senior health policy advisor to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said that the hospital is crowded because of its popularity.
“LAC+USC County Hospital is relied on by the public and the law enforcement,” Leaf said. “It’s a high demand hospital with a trauma center, and those are some reasons why it’s overcrowded.”
Leaf said LAC-USC County Hospital needs to consider what actions could be taken internally, by realizing what kinds of deficiencies are present, assessing the seasonal nature of the overcrowding and better managing its discharges.
However, this problem is not unlike other hospitals in the nation, said Dr. Philip Lumb, president of the Attending Staff Association of LAC+USC County Hospital.
“It’s unfortunate to have waits,” Lumb said. “But they are reasonably well taken care of and indeed the emergency department is one of the leaders in the nation in the pursuit of developing the algorithms to minimize wait.”
Officials credit the more recent influx of patients to the flu season and also the H1N1 virus. Marquez agreed the swell in numbers was expected because “the colder it gets, the sicker people get.”
Lumb said the hospital is an asset to USC because it shows the care USC has for the community around it, but that USC would not take any action in altering hospital policy.
“[USC] would probably not wish to be too involved with hospital policy because that’s not their level of expertise,” Lumb said. “The policies that a hospital develops to take care of patients, to support its administrative functions, to support its community function, really are all in compliance with state and federal regulations … and also county regulations.”
However, Marquez said she still thinks it is a shame that more patients aren’t treated in the facility.
“It’s like a flawless diamond ring that is too small for your hand,” Marquez said.
““[USC] would probably not wish to be too involved with hospital policy because that’s not their level of expertise,” Lumb said. “
I beg to differ.  If USC does not get involved with hospital policy, it has more to do with politics than policy expertise.  In fact, if USC adminstrators ran the hospital rather than county workers, it would probably be more efficient.

At high noon on Trousdale Parkway, the walkway is choked by the ritual lunch rush. Among the maze of legs slides a pair of wheels belonging to an intrepid student cyclist. Desperate to reach class on time, the biker darts and weaves like a slalom skier through fleshy gates. There’s a carefree confidence in his eyes.
But confidence is not always an indication of skill, and the cyclist slams into another foolhardy rider with a shuddering crash. For a few moments, human limbs and metal frames lie in a heap before the two embarrassed bikers apologize and continue on their way.
This scenario sounds like the making of a blockbuster YouTube video, but for the many organizations on campus concerned with student health and safety, such an everyday accident is nothing to joke about.
“It is a serious health concern,” said Natasha Mmeje, a health educator for Health Promotion and Prevention Services. “I have witnessed numerous accidents and I think because they’re so commonplace people just laugh them off, but it’s pretty dangerous. It’s dangerous for the bikers and it’s dangerous to be a pedestrian.”
Saying that the bicycle situation is “out of control,” Mmeje cited a spring 2009 study conducted by the Student Health Center, which found that there were between 10,000 to 15,000 bicycles on campus at any time. And trends suggest that number is climbing.
“I came to this campus in 2004 as a grad student, and just since that time five years ago I’ve noticed a huge change, not just in the sheer number of bikes, but the lack of courtesy as it relates to biking,” Mmeje said. “There are bikes everywhere, and it’s not just the bikes; it’s the carts, other traffic that is just inundating the campus.”
Health Promotion and Prevention Services is just one member of the Traffic Safety Task Force, a recently formed university-wide group devoted to addressing the dangers of a campus constricted by vehicle traffic. The organization held its second meeting last Friday.
One member of the task force is Ed Becker, USC’s director of environmental health and safety, who said the group is looking at numerous solutions to the difficult problem. Proposed physical solutions to the bike problem range from a large permanent bike-parking facility, advocated specifically by the Undergraduate Student Government, to the addition of thruways or lanes dedicated to bikers.
While the task force is not considering a campus-wide bicycle ban — a solution raised by the Department of Public Safety last semester — Becker believes that some restricted access for bicycles lies in the future.
“The campus can only accommodate so many bicycles, so in the end one of the ideas that we’ve come up with is having landing spots where you park your bike somewhere and then walk to wherever you’re going,” Becker explained.
Becker also said that simple solutions to dangerous situations, which could be bicycles cluttering no parking zones in front of handicap entrances, could be implemented quickly and enforced easily.
In a sentiment echoed by numerous members, Becker explained that the variety of voices represented on the task force and the necessity of research and planning made it difficult for more long-term changes to be implemented.
“If you’re going to have a large design or redesign, if there’s a proposal for an in-depth study of bicycle use on campus or traffic patterns, that’s something that could take a little longer,” Becker said. “The ideal time line is that by April we could have the formal recommendations submitted, and by the end of the school year, we could have a plan in action.”
Beyond the long-term physical solutions to the problem, the task force also sees better bike safety and etiquette education as an essential piece of the solution. Helen Moser, director of campus affairs for USG, said her office is recommending new ways of reaching out to students about the dangers of biking.
“We see education being a part of the process for incoming freshmen because we want to make it a part of the culture at USC to know how to operate your bike,” Moser said. “We also want voluntary classes for upperclassmen where you can go and learn about bike safety.”
Wyman Thomas, a crime prevention specialist for DPS, also discussed the importance of education to changing the bike culture on campus. According to Thomas, DPS distributes pamphlets and flyers both with bike registration and whenever the Los Angeles Police Department cites students en masse at intersections near campus.
Eric Bruins, an officer for the USC cycling team and a self-professed bike safety hobbyist, echoed common student complaints that bicycle citations seem arbitrary, suggesting that education about the rules is necessary for both students and police.
“They target certain things that may or may not be against the rules, and they don’t target other things that are against the rules and it’s not even very clear what the rules are,” said Bruins, a senior majoring in public policy, planning and management.
In past years, one of the major deterrents against riding through the rush hour-strangled center of campus between Trousdale Parkway and Childs Way were the bike bans, which were enforced from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. every weekday. Thomas said that the bans have not disappeared, but that campus construction has forced DPS to turn its focus away from the center of campus.
“We have dedicated an officer to 34th and McClintock and that intersection alone is just overpopulated and so we have to dedicate an officer there regardless. So if we have to choose between 34th and McClintock and center campus, we’re going to choose 34th and McClintock,” Thomas explained.
Thomas said that the restrictions — along with an officer to enforce them — would return once DPS had reduced crime in other parts of the University Park area.
While the proposed solutions to the bicycle safety problem are myriad, each clattering, painful lunchtime collision is a reminder of the urgency of the situation to those concerned. In spite of a campus culture that might take such collisions as an everyday hazard, Moser cited a survey conducted by USG that found that around 90 percent of students said they had been hit or almost hit by vehicles on campus, a number that belies the real danger of the situation.
“I’ve been hit numerous times — and that’s not to say that I’m perfect — but I do think it’s dangerous,” Moser said. “I think people are afraid to walk on campus, people are afraid to bike on campus and there’s definitely something that needs to be done about it.”
The worst part about this is that it’s not just bicyclists who disregard traffic law.  I have witnessed all vehicles–cars, bicycles, Campus Cruiser, DPS chariots, and DPS SUVs–disregard traffic law.
It might be argued that DPS chariots and DPS SUVs do not have to stop at stop signs.  After all, they have places to be, maybe emergencies.  I, however, witnessed a DPS chariot crossing Jefferson and McClintock during a “Walking” phase, after coming out of the bike path on Jefferson, going against traffic.  I was curious about where the DPS officer was headed, and because I was on bicycle, followed the officer to PSA, the parking area for chariots.  I do not believe that finding a parking spot would qualify as an emergency, enabling the DPS officer to cross the street in the crosswalk during a Walking phase.  After all, bicyclists have been cited for doing this exact thing!  Of course, during this pursuit, I also witnessed a DPS SUV barely slowing down at a Stop sign, and 2 chariots not even slowing down at the same stop sign.  DPS needs to realize that it sets examples for students who are unfamiliar with California Vehicle Code, as it relates to bicycles.
Pedestrians also need to realize that even on campus, they should look down the street before crossing.  It isn’t just a bicycle safety issue.  Pedestrians need to be smart.  Bicyclists need to be smart.  Cars, and the DPS need to be smart.
My apologies–I forgot about longboarders and skateboarders who weave through pedestrian traffic.  Many of them know how to jump off their boards to stop, but not how to stop their boards from hitting others.
USC students who commute on bicycles are not the problem.  As a cyclist myself I have ridden with real cycling pro’s and understand how important safety is.  All those students are not “COMMUTING” they just don’t want to walk 50 let alone 500 yards.  They are the worst cyclist I have ever seen awho don’t even care about safety gear and even less common courtesy.  Go stand at Gate 5 at high noon and tell me USC is not in trouble.  USC quality of life is suffering and even outsiders (visitors, contractors, LAFD, LAPD) cannot beleive how unsafe the students are.  IT is not DPS job to teach common sense.  It is time to stop riding in the interior of the campus it is too unsafe and no one listens or cares if they are late.
Oh my gosh, we better educate students about the DANGERS OF CYCLING before it’s too late!!!  What has caused this sudden rash of anti-cycling articles in the Daily Trojan?
As a cyclist commuting from the west side of Los Angeles, I would welcome secure bike storage near the edge of campus (bike lockers–racks don’t count, unless there’s a DPS officer standing by them 24/7, and even then…).  Until DPS implements secure storage, I will ride my bike across campus to store it in my office.
What DPS does not seem to realize is that discouraging cyclists is just going to encourage them to drive–they don’t just magically go away when you harass them.  Ah well, I guess it’s not DPS’s problem if the traffic around campus gets worse.

If you haven’t been hibernating for the past year, you know that health care reform is the big issue in Washington right now. There’s also a good chance that you are confused by all of the terms, information and opinions that surround the issue. So what exactly is the deal with health care reform?
Democrats and Republicans have been trying (and failing) to institute some sort of health insurance reform since Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office, and President Barack Obama has made it his top domestic priority. The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized country without some sort of universal coverage, which many people see as unfair to those who can’t afford medical insurance. The number of people with this belief is growing — there are now nearly 46 million uninsured Americans, and an additional 25 million are underinsured.
The problem is compounded by the soaring costs of health care, which are not being matched by results. In 2007 the United States spent $2.4 trillion on health care, or $7,900 per person. This is far more than is spent anywhere else — 52 percent more than the next most costly country, Norway — yet our health care system is not far better than other wealthy nations.
There is a lot of debate about just how effective our system is, but our 50th place international ranking in life expectancy demonstrates that, at the very least, we are not leading the pack the way that our spending indicates we should be. Further, our high health care costs lead to high insurance premiums, which explain why so many people are uninsured as many businesses don’t cover their employees.
The problem is acute in California. The number of uninsured people in the state is 6.8 million and growing, while the percentage of people with employer-based coverage is 62.2 and shrinking.
To address this, Democrats have proposed several reforms that Congress is now attempting to reconcile. Many of their features are shared, while a few are causing major controversies.
The major elements of proposed reforms include:
• Making it easier to qualify for Medicaid (a government program that offers insurance for the poor).
• Offering subsidies to help people buy insurance on their own.
• Forbidding insurance companies from denying coverage to people because of pre-existing conditions. Currently, many people with ailments like diabetes or high blood pressure cannot get insurance because the companies refuse to cover them.
• Creating “insurance exchanges” — government-regulated marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can compare insurance plans and choose the best ones. These are intended to resolve the information problem that often leads to people being uninsured or underinsured, or paying too much for what they are getting. The government would likely improve competition in the insurance industry by allowing consumers to see the differences between plans and their prices
• Requiring businesses over a certain size to either provide coverage to their employees or contribute to the cost of insurance.
• Penalizing those people who choose not to get insurance.
• Creating a “public option” — a government-run insurance plan that will be an alternative for those buying their insurance through exchange.
This public option has been the biggest controversy over the course of the health care debate. Many conservatives are afraid of giving the government too big of a role in the actual insurance market, while Obama and many liberals argue that the public option will foster competition, lower costs and give consumers a greater variety of affordable choices. Conservatives also fear a public option will be of low quality, and its low premiums will lead businesses that currently buy private insurance to opt for the cheaper plan.
A more specific debate, this one between liberal and conservative-leaning Democrats . has been over the pricing of the public option.
Originally, liberals led by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi wanted to peg its payments to doctors at slightly higher rates than Medicare’s. Doctors led by the American Medical Association came out in force against this plan, saying Medicare rates are way below their costs and they could not afford similar rates from the public option. The so-called “blue dogs” — conservative Democrats — sided with the doctors, and Pelosi was forced to retreat from her position. As of now, any government-run plan would negotiate rates the same way that private insurers do.
The other major controversy over health reform has been its cost; Obama estimates the cost of his proposed plan at $900 billion. Republicans have objected, saying that America cannot afford such spending, especially in what will be the most expensive year ever for the federal government. They also question where he will get the money and are wary of tax increases.
We are moving closer to seeing some sort of reform, despite the problems. On Nov. 7, the House approved a reform plan by the narrow margin of 220 to 215 votes. Passing the Senate will be harder, as Democrats need 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster; there are 60 members of the Democratic caucus, but two are independent and one of those, Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), has said he will not allow a bill that includes a public option.
Time is also working against health reform. Public opinion has been gradually shifting against it as Republicans have been more effective than the Obama team at marketing their position. This puts pressure on the Democrats from conservative states and might kill the chances of a major reform if it isn’t approved soon.
It is morally questionable at best that around 20 percent of our population cannot afford medical care, yet we are the richest country in the world. For the poorest Americans, a health problem can represent a financial deathblow. We have a responsibility to address that situation.
Further, for those who have insurance, our system is often confusing and overly expensive. Reform would clarify the system for consumers and lower insurance costs.
Though opponents often point out the undeniably huge price tag, the well-respected Congressional Budget Office has said that the House bill would actually reduce the deficit over the next 10 years.
This is because we already pay for the uninsured. Many people who are satisfied with their current coverage object at having to pay for others, but the reality is that people who are uninsured go to the emergency room for care that they cannot pay for — and the government foots that bill with our tax dollars. Economic studies have shown that the costs we incur because of uninsured people exceed the costs of insuring them, a damning indictment of our current system.
The biggest worry is that employees who receive high-quality insurance through work will see their employers switch to a lower quality public option. This is certainly a possibility and seems like the only claimed drawback of health reform that is an actual concern.
But the recent compromise to negotiate public option payments to doctors and hospitals like private insurers do seems like it may alleviate a bit of the concern about quality. This is likely to be only a short-term problem as the competition that the public option introduces to the market, combined with the greater transparency promised by exchanges, will alleviate it over time. This is because if so many employers really do switch to the public option, the private insurers will have no choice but to lower their premiums to compete with the government.
This may be a drawback, but it is likely to be a small, short-term one that is worth coping with in exchange for an insurance market that is efficient, fair, saves us and covers every American.

In the United States, college life and alcohol consumption are seemingly inextricable. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, heavy drinking rates among college students, defined as the two-week prevalence of five or more drinks in a row, have changed little in the last 30 years, dropping from 45 percent in 1979 to only 41 percent in 2007.
This plateau in statistics has occurred despite outreach efforts, but USC officials said they remain committed to keeping students safe and informed while still encouraging them to have a memorable college experience.

“Although the majority of our students drink on some level, most of our students drink moderately or responsibly most of the time. Excessive drinking is not as pervasive as the perception would suggest it to be, but it does happen,” said Jenny Attanasio, a health educator for Health Promotion and Prevention Services at USC. “There’s policy pieces that fit into [addressing] it, there’s programmatic pieces that fit into it, there’s individual concentration and more of an educational focus.”
This interaction of the university environment with enforcement and educational efforts is the focus of a recent study conducted by Outside the Classroom, a company dedicated to addressing public health issues affecting education, government and corporate institutions.
The study attributed the continued presence of high-risk drinking on college campuses to the failure of many university administrations in making alcohol prevention an institutional priority. Outside the Classroom found that alcohol prevention, unlike sustainability initiatives, tends to receive little in terms of resources, funding, educational programs and support from senior administrators. According to the study, most universities assign the task of alcohol prevention to just one department, usually student affairs, instead of making it a campus-wide initiative.
“With most university strategic plans, you’ll see messaging in there about sustainability, but it’s almost an entire rarity that you will read anything about tackling high-risk drinking,” said Brandon Busteed, founder and CEO of Outside the Classroom. “We’re at a point now where everyone knows what their responsibility is for sustainability, and we don’t have that shared accountability for alcohol abuse. It’s a big difference between the two examples.”
The perception that many universities, including USC, direct more resources toward going green than toward alcohol prevention is common among students like Natasha Zouves, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism.
“USC stays pretty uninvolved when it comes to students drinking. I think it’s a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy,” Zouves said. “The administration is aware that underage drinking is going on, but they don’t intervene.”
USC’s policies on alcohol use align with state and local statutes regarding alcohol consumption, and the Department of Public Safety along with Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards are responsible for enforcing those rules, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said. Like most universities, USC does its best to curb underage drinking, but carding students at large parties and tailgating events is both difficult and impractical, he added.
“Underage drinking is inappropriate, but realistically we know it occurs, so we try and regulate the consumption of alcohol as much as we practically can,” Carlisle said. “Picture three or four DPS officers and 300 students [at a party]. What in all practicality is the best way to handle that situation? Our goal is to get everyone safely home and make sure no one gets hurt, but sometimes it’s appropriate to cite students.”
SJACS Director Raquel Torres-Retana said alcohol-related violations, which range from underage possession of alcohol to disorderly conduct, comprise about one-third of the cases SJACS has handled so far this year. Many students are cited not for violating USC’s alcohol policies but for engaging in unruly behavior as a result of their alcohol consumption, she added.
As for punishing students who are cited, Torres-Retana said SJACS typically turns to educational programs before taking more serious action.
“Education is much more preferred than punitive [repercussions]. We do have standards we want our students to live up to, and if they violate those, we will work with them to try to get them back to good behavior,” she said. “But if the student keeps coming back to our office, then there may be punitive consequences.”
Even though the administration receives information from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism about how to address high-risk drinking on campus, the task of educating students and implementing other alcohol prevention strategies falls on HPPS, Attanasio said.
“If you had an ideal campus, I think it would be safe to say the upper administration should be able to set an agenda and then allow the folks in the workable places of whatever the subject matter is to do the work, but I really think it comes into play with resource allocation — whether that’s staff time, the number of staff who are professionally trained and capable and have the time in their day to focus on these areas, [or] actual dollar funds,” Attanasio said. “It’s just where priorities lie and what administrations think needs to happen on campus. I don’t think the involvement piece is so much in the tangible aspects but in the resource allocation.”
Currently, in conjunction with Student Affairs and DPS, HPPS promotes safe alcohol consumption practices through educational programming; counseling services and partnerships with local treatment centers; communication with senior administrators and annual distribution of USC Drug Free, a document detailing USC’s policies concerning alcohol and drug use, to students, staff and faculty, Attanasio said.
The most recognizable aspect of HPPS efforts for many USC students is Outside the Classroom’s “AlcoholEdu for College,” an online alcohol prevention program designed to inform college students about the dangers of high-risk drinking and to encourage them to make wise decisions about alcohol consumption. USC requires that all freshmen and transfer students complete the course.
According to an AlcoholEdu executive summary of key findings at USC, 72 percent of freshmen completed the entire course in 2007, with the percentage of students reporting they knew more than a “moderate amount” about the effects of alcohol increasing from 39 percent pre-survey to 77 percent post-survey.
But the report also indicated that 54 percent of drinkers who completed the course believed they did not need to change the way they used alcohol.
Vanessa Hyde, a freshman majoring in psychology, said she understands the university has a responsibility to educate students about alcohol consumption, but that students will ultimately decide for themselves if they want to alter their behavior.
“They can only do so much, but people will still do what they want. Everything depends on the individual and how much help they’re willing to take,” she said.
Most USC students’ drinking habits may help to explain the finding regarding behavior change, Attanasio said. Seventy-five percent of USC students reported having zero to four drinks the last time they socialized, and this number of drinks is not concerning as long as students pace their rate of consumption, Attanasio said.
Meng Yang, a second-year graduate student in landscape architecture, said he believes most students know how to regulate their drinking habits wisely.
“We can handle it. Alcohol is not our lives,” Yang said. “Everybody should know that because we’re all adults and we’re in college. We all have to take personal responsibility.”
But Zouves said she often sees students drinking to excess and that initiatives like AlcoholEdu are not enough to combat the problem.
“A lot of students don’t know their limits and think they’re invincible. I’ve seen a lot of parties where both guys and girls are drinking to a point where it’s unsafe,” Zouves said. “I do sometimes wish that students were safer, but I’m not sure it’s so much a USC problem as it is a problem of education.”
Attanasio said she believes USC’s efforts to inform students about safe alcohol consumption are far-reaching but that the dissemination of information does not fully address the issue of alcohol prevention. A lack of sufficient funding for HPPS to implement strategies aside from AlcoholEdu has limited how much the department can do, she added.
“Where I think things are lacking is the ability to have a completely comprehensive program at the level that would be needed for a population of 34,000 students,” Attanasio said. “There’s a piece of it that can be information-related, where if [students] know this information they may make a different choice, but the complicating piece in that is what will be the expectations in the environment.
“It’s not peer pressure, but it’s the norm with the folks they’re with or this is the norm in their culture. It’s situationally related and not necessarily this particular place, and students are having a hard time with that because they want to do what’s expected. But how do they do it safely?”

It’s 6 a.m. and the sun is slowly rising over Leavey Library. After an all-nighter sipping on coffee, fidgeting students sit quietly in cubicles, staring at computer screens and dozing off, all facing the same scenario — stressing to pump out a paper, project or cramming anxiously to get an A.
“You bring it on yourself, but it’s not really your fault because there is so much going on, and you feel like… you want to do everything at the same time,” said Sali Kharaza, a sophomore majoring in public relations.

There is no doubt USC students deal with stress on a day-to-day basis. With papers, exams, internships, jobs, extracurricular activities, financial responsibilities, social and family life — or even just short-term issues like getting stuck in a long line at Trojan Grounds and running late to class — a student’s life without a little adrenaline flowing through the body and too many thoughts crowding the mind seems almost obsolete.
“There is a line between working hard and having superhuman strength,” said Stephanie Graves, a senior and progressive degree student majoring in communication. “In the real world there’s some sort of demarcation between your work and the rest of your life and at school there isn’t … Everything revolves around your university life.”
Within the realm of USC university life, 41 percent of undergraduate students and 44 percent of graduate students said they experience more than average stress; 36 percent of undergraduates and 32 percent of graduate students say they experience average stress, according to the 2009 National College Health Assessment Report.
And not only do USC students experience stress, but they also said it is one of the leading and most frequent threats to academic success, along with having a learning disability, depression or developing a cold or the flu.
Yet the prevalence of stress on campus often creates a confusing dilemma for students. The psychological and medical communities emphasize its health effects, but sometimes students can be caught between what’s good for them in the long run or at a specific moment.
“Most of our students are sleep deprived — I mean it’s just the name of the game,” said Ilene Rosenstein, director of USC counseling services. “When you’re tired, exercise sometimes feels like the exact opposite than what you want to do …you might want to use the extra half an hour to sleep.”
Short-term effects of stress, Rosenstein explained, tamper with a student’s decision-making ability, judgment, concentration, attention and memory and can create irregular and unhealthy sleeping patterns.
One long-term effect of stress is a weakened immune system. And some students might develop unhealthy habits like turning to food when they’re stressed out, while others turn away from food. Other students can also be prone to getting in a car or bicycle accident.
“Alcohol and drugs are used as a way to relieve stress, and even sex, in terms of hooking up and those kind of things as these releases…really get people in trouble,” said Rosenstein.
Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, director of the USC University Park Health Center, said 20-29 year olds are especially prone to experiencing these short and long-term effects. The group has the highest rate of serious mental health issues, like stress that can eventually snowball  into depression and anxiety for some.
The impact of long-term stress is more severe than acute stress on the brain — biologically and chemically. It alters brain chemistry, rewiring the brain’s connections and ultimately also affecting a person’s genetic make-up over a long period of time, according to Jean Chen Smith, USC professor of neurobiology who has studied the effects of stress on brain chemistry.
But the students who are most at risk are those who deal with day-to-day hassles. Acute stress is harder for people to deal with than chronic stress, such as the stress that can ensue from the loss of a loved one, long-term family problems or moving, Rosenstein explained.
“Who wants to hear it? You get no sympathy, no empathy for this. [You get] no attention, and you don’t give it to yourself either,” she said.
Some students might have an even harder time speaking out because they are under hovering “helicopter” parents, Neinstein said.
“When you have parents at the level of an undergraduate or even a graduate student intervening for a student on everything from grades to interviews on a daily basis, what you have is an individual who is really not learning how to manage problems on their own,” he said.
This can lead to anxiety for many students, according to a medical study focused on parenting issues because students who were allowed to make decisions and face consequences on their own were less likely to have anxiety.
Amanda Christensen, a junior majoring in linguistics who decided to take a semester off to relax and figure out what she wanted to major in, said it’s really about how supportive family is of a decision like hers.
“I guess everyone does have their different pressures. You’re [at USC] to find out what you want to do, but it’s nice to have friends, family, and counselors you can always talk to,” she said.
But not every stressed USC student uses counseling services, and some believe the stigma and social connotation of the word “counseling” will ward off even the most stressed of the USC population.
“The word [counselor] alone is not very inviting at all,” said Slag.
But Rosenstein said the stigma of the term is rapidly changing.
“Your generation is so used to getting help. If you didn’t get an SAT score high enough, you go to class. People are used to trying to do their best … so it makes sense that people also want to get their stress to a healthy level,” said Rosenstein.
If counseling doesn’t seem like an option for some minutely stressed students, USC offers other ways to deal with stress, such as a meditation group and a two-unit stress management course that teaches students mental and physical ways to deal with stress.
The class, according to USC physical education Professor Danielle Roman, attracts students from an array of majors and class standings and teaches them how to look at stress not as a threat but as a challenge and motivating factor.
Roman said some students may not take anything away from the class because they are not open to trying these techniques and have a hard time changing their habits. But other students, like Darci Kimble-Manalo, a senior majoring in kinesiology, and Marie Agnello, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism, think the class has helped them make a change in their lives.
Kimble-Manalo, who said she is usually stressed because of long lab hours on top of lecture hours in the kinesiology department, has been thinking about stress at USC as well as ways the university could help stressed students on campus.
“My idea was to have, like, a building on campus where there would be individual rooms and students can go there and take naps. You can design the room in terms of music, smells, temperature,” Kimble-Manalo said.
Mary-Helen Immordino-Yang, assistant USC professor and expert in the neuroscience of learning, including student anxiety, said USC should design healthy learning environments that support “intrinsic” motivation rather than anxiety, because the mind and biology are intertwined. Thoughts and interpretations about school work are going to affect the way a person biologically reacts to stress, she said.
“Some people do their school work because they are intrinsically interested in it and are motivated to learn it,” Yang said.
“Others [do it] because they focus on extrinsic motivation because their parents are going to be mad at them because they spend a lot of tuition,” she said. “Both sources of motivation will motivate you, but intrinsic motivation results in much meaningful learning that is built into the knowledge that you are learning instead of pleasing someone else.”
Students said they find the reading assignments, papers and tests in general education classes tedious. The courses can be stressful, they said, because it’s hard to become interested in a required class that might not be relevant to their major or interests.
“This isn’t just coming to school doing what I want to learn because if that’d be the case I’d only be taking theatre and psychology classes,” Slag said. “I wouldn’t be forced to take all these ‘GE’s’.”
Although parents can have high expectations for students to perform well, Graves said there is more to understand about the university lifestyle.
“Everybody is busy here, but some people can handle amounts of stress more than others,” Graves said. “If someone doesn’t join an organization because they don’t have time, and you feel like you’ve got more on your plate, you’ve got to understand you can’t judge them for that because they might not be able to handle stress a lot.”
As for major classes, students may begin to feel stressed because the courses and majors can be “cutthroat.”
“You’re like, ‘Wait, this is really competitive,’ and that freaks you out because you think, ‘Am I going to succeed?’ Everyone here is on my level,” said Kharaza.
But Graves disagreed.
“[School] is competitive, but I don’t feel like in a bad way sometimes because you still have that sense that this is the Trojan Family, and it just pushes you to be better,” she said.
Graves, who is a squad leader in the Trojan Marching Band, a sorority member, co-director of a ballet dance company, working an internship, and a member of a concert band and orchestra, said it’s a learning process for students to figure out just how much they can handle without being stressed.
“I know I can’t do everything, “ Graves said. “I get to the point where I have a good idea of I need to be involved in.”
Because our Western model of education involves independent work with deadlines and enforces extracurricular activities, Yang said the system is inherently stressful. Other students said life is just stressful from college onward and right now is the best time for a student to use the resources USC provides so it will be easier for them after graduation.
In the end, the question may not be what else USC can do to help students, but how students can come to terms with their daily lives —whether it’s counseling, or just a 20-minute jog every day.
“College is stressful, but so is life,” Neinstein said. “So the answer is, do you know how to cope and deal with it?”
This is an excellent article and very timely during exam period. As a full time employee at a law school in Downtown, plus a full time USC doctoral student in the evening, I can relate to the sentiments noted in the article. My body reacted to stress I didn’t know was there, by landing me in the cardiac care unit of a hospital during an evening class at USC this past Summer. My mind didn’t tell me I was stressed, as I was laughing, having a great time, and enjoying my favorite class in my program thus far. However, my physiology told a different story. I’m 33 years old, and had to have that “Come to Jesus” type moment while strapped to a gurney, hooked up to heart monitors, EKG readouts, and taking nitro glicerin. It became a tipping point in my life where I had to look long and hard at what I was doing right, and what I was doing wrong. In a nutshell, I began a stress reduction regiment of massages, making sure I take 1 day out of the week for “me time,” keeping a schedule so I can calendar in papers, research, and projects, thus reducing the all-nighters and last minute catch-up. All of this has had a marked improvement in my health. I’ve lost weight, and my blood pressure is textbook perfect.
I empathize with students and all the pressures to succeed. You’re a full-time student, friend, family member, etc…but if you’re not taking care of yourself, you’re no good to anyone else. My committment to taking care of myself has not only made me a better student, but a better friend, family member, and employee at my job.
I wish all of my fellow Trojans the best of luck on finals and papers, and emplore you to relax, take it easy, and make time for you to be “you.”
Thank you “Once Stressed.” I’m the same age as you, and not to delve into my long story about why I’m in my current situation, I’m in the undergraduate program. It’s stressful as hell. I’m burned out, spent too much time at the community college (4 yrs.) prior to transferring here…and it seems to me, at times, a pyrrhic victory. My GPA slipped, I’m barely getting by…I just don’t care anymore. I just want to get my B.S. and get on.
It is encouraging to read a more accurate way of looking at stress. Many people confuse stress with anxiety, fear and hysteria so it is helpful for people to learn that stress is a reality of life that one cannot avoid.
It is also helpful to know that coping with stress is a skill that one that needs to be learned before stress occurs or at least as soon as it occurs!  It would really be helpful if colleges, parents and schools would provide more help for children and students in this regard.  Anxiety is the result of stress. Students need help in learning how to cope with it in healthy ways, not by being drugged by physicians.

As the number of farmers’ markets on and around campus continues to rise, many of those markets — including the Trojan Fresh Market, which will be on campus on Thursday — have seen profits fall, though most blame the slip on the economy and not on the increased competition.
Besides the on-campus Trojan Fresh Market, there are at least six other markets near USC. Many of these markets report that their profits are down, but individual vendors often benefit by selling at multiple venues.
Farmville · A man shops for vegetables at the farmers’ market located at Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. The market, which is near St. Agnes Catholic Church, runs on Wednesdays from 2-5 p.m. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
Helen Lee, who manages the farmers’ market at the Shrine that runs every Tuesday, said she does not think her market is competing with the Trojan Fresh Market or any of the others.
“We don’t consider us in competition with USC,” Lee said. “And the Trojan Fresh Market doesn’t affect our business. In fact, [USC] Hospitality came through here and took some vendors to the Trojan Fresh Market … We encourage that.”
Lee said she never had any intention of making money from the farmers’ markets. Instead, she wanted to help the vendors make money, so when they’re approached and asked to join other farmers’ markets, she views it as a good thing.
“[The Shrine farmers’ market] helps a lot of local neighbors who came here as vendors,” Lee said. “We’re definitely here just for the people.”
Vendors at the Shrine, however, have also found business to be slow so far this year.
Olove Boyd, an employee for Heavenly Delights, which sells cobbler at the Shrine and other farmers markets, said business is down right now.
“Usually it’s slow in the beginning, but hopefully it picks up,” Boyd said. “I think it’s the economy. Farmers’ markets are not a necessity … When there are cutbacks, people take hits.”
Boyd noted that it is USC that drives her business, even with the presence of the Trojan Fresh Market.
“The majority [of customers]  are students and USC employees,” Boyd said. “USC helps our business or we wouldn’t be here.”
Dexter Scott, who sells beans at the Shrine farmers’ market, said he has also experienced a decrease in sales this semester.
“It is one half of last year’s gross income,” Scott said.
A farmers’ market on Vermont Avenue and Adams Boulevard seems to be experiencing the same problems as the Shrine farmers’ market. Most of the vendors are seeing less and less business, but still, they say the economy is at fault rather than competing markets.
“Each year it seems to get slower and slower because of the economy,” said Luis Buenrostro, who sells produce.
The market’s manager, Kimberly Edwards, said she also believes the decline in profits is because people do not have the money to shop at farmers’ markets. She said she does not think she is losing clients to other farmers’ markets in the area.
“A lot of these customers who come here … they follow us where we go,” Edwards said. “Our business is slow because of the recession, and farmers’ markets are more expensive than the store.”
Edwards added that USC drives the market, even though the Trojan Fresh Market is a more convenient option.
“We got a lot of people from USC coming here,” Edwards said. “We see doctors, students, teachers … We get a big variety of people from USC.”
But Meera Dahyabhai, marketing chair for the student group Environment First, which is involved in the Trojan Fresh Market, said she thinks the competition has affected Hospitality’s farmers’ market.
“The revenue patterns have overall decreased due to competition with other markets,” she said.
Still, she said she does not think the increasing number of markets is a bad thing.
“It’s all about reaching the same goal,” Dahyabhai said. “The main goal is to fund that idea of organic and fresh products to support local vendors.”
