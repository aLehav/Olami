A lot has changed about computers and fantasy football in the last decade. Computers are now faster than Usain Bolt, newspapers are quickly fading (yet here I am writing for a newspaper) and fantasy football is played almost exclusively online.
While technology and fantasy football have come a long way since Michael Vick was first getting headlines (for his football play), the way information is presented to fantasy football players has largely remained stagnant. Websites such as ESPN.com, cbssportsline.com, Yahoo! Sports and nfl.com, have largely offered the same information every year, and that information is solely statistical.
Five guys from Chicago are trying to change that. They’ve all been playing fantasy football since before many USC students were born. And on Aug. 1, those five friends, all in their mid-30s and best friends since elementary school, launched Pyromaniac.com.
“I’ve been playing fantasy football since 1988, and every year would go by and I wouldn’t see a change in fantasy football websites. They are literally the same as they were 10 years ago,” said co-founder Derek Noonan.
Noonan, 36, has been building websites ever since the ancient browser Mosaic came out in 1993. He’s built websites for Harley Davidson and Coca Cola, but now he owns his own web-developing company, and he makes Pyromaniac.com different from any other web site by incorporating his lightweight programming and new technologies.
But the technology is only the beginning when separating Pryomaniac.com from other mainstream web sites such as Yahoo.com
“The main thing that separates Pyro from all the other sites is that it’s fun,” Noonan said. “We are trying to bring fun and an entertainment value into it with our characters, energy and the wit in our editorial.”
The editorial content is what fantasy football players are looking for, and Pyromaniac.com does a great job providing in-depth analysis alongside entertaining snippets. Every top-150 fantasy football player has a profile, which contains much more than simple statistics and a brief analysis. If you want to know Kyle Orton’s touchdown to interception ratio in the first half versus the second half of the season, you will find that. If you want to know how DeAngelo Williams has fared in the last three years during weeks 14-16, the fantasy football playoff weeks, you can find that.
But, if you also want to know why Terrell Owens is represented by a piece of excrement or what Braylon Edwards, Mugatu and male modeling all have to do with fantasy football, the Pyromaniac.com writers will be more than happy to tell you.
“Our honest but somewhat brutal approach to these players is one thing that separates us,” Tenny Stegman, another co-founder, said. “We are trying to liven it up with the Daily Pill, our blogs and player profiles.”
If you’re concerned with whether or not these guys are properly equipped to give fantasy football advice to people, throw that idea away. Jeremy Alpert, 36, another founder of the website, has worked with STATS Inc. since 1998, and the information available at his fingertips is endless.
“Stats have become second nature for me,” Alpert said. “I know how to put numbers together.”
There’s also the Rain Man. Anyone familiar with the movie starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman knows there’s no need for explanation here.
“Having the Rain Man, our stat guy who has the ability to look at a player and just rip off stats on him, definitely helps us in our content,” Stegman said.
But while the founders had an exponential amount of content and statistics available to them, one thing that wasn’t readily available, especially in today’s economy, was money. They are starting a small business, and people are still trying to figure out how to make a significant living off the internet. Creating a website today isn’t as expensive as it once was, but adding all the amenities that make it flow smoothly and giving it that sleek look costs tens of thousands of dollars.
Pyromaniac.com has a few investors, including Alpert, who are mainly close friends of the founders. The founders quickly surpassed their budget, and Alpert admitted he borrowed money from his mom, but he also contributed a significant portion on his own, which was something he was more than willing to risk.
“In today’s economy, when you see a $4-billion industry that doesn’t take a hit, then you see it’s something that you can probably make you some money,” Alpert said. “Seeing what the guys at Pyro are doing and how cookie-cutter all the fantasy websites are out there, you can’t help but see that this is going to work.”
As of now, it is working. Noonan said most of the money Pyromaniac.com is making now is mainly off ads and draft kits they are selling. But Noonan has a friend who works at Facebook who advised him that once he gets more than 100,000 daily page views, he can make about $2 per view.
That time is still about five years down the road, and hopefully five years from now, Pyromaniac.com will still be around. Where else would I go to read about Cedric Benson’s BUI and find out that he had 500 more rushing yards in the second half of the season last year versus the first half?
As of now, nowhere.

A new fire has been lit underneath the No.12 USC women’s volleyball team during the offseason, and that excitement and energy is allowing the team to perform above the expectations of many, including head coach Mick Haley.
“The performance differences between this summer and previous seasons are like night and day,” Haley said. “Our gym culture is truly exceptional with these girls and the energy this season is exciting. It’s what we like to see at the beginning of the season.”
Leading the charge · Senior Jessica Gysin looks to guide USC along with co-captain Alli Hilgren. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
USC’s women’s volleyball team has been a major force in the Trojan Athletic Department for many years, spending most of the recent years in top-5 rankings, but a mix of injuries and the loss of senior leadership caused the team to slip down to a No.12 preseason ranking.
The team captains this season have taken the responsibility of getting back that senior leadership and are taking that role to heart by dedicating themselves to bonding the team as a family and cohesive unit. Seniors Jessica Gysin, an All-American outside hitter, and Libero Alli Hillgren have focused on their personal game as well as the team game and have really excelled in their offseason practice.
“The seniors are doing a great job getting the team together,” Haley said. “Gysin and Hillgren have brought a maturity and skill to the rest of the team, and they are really bonded as a group.”
Along with the two team captains, the team has one remaining senior: Emilie Stewart, a middle blocker and outside hitter who transferred from Fordham last season.
With such a young team, Haley has said that the sophomores needed to step up to have a successful season, and after their time off, he feels like they have done that and more.
“Alex Jupiter has shown a huge improvement in her precision,” Haley said about the sophomore. “We’ve had a lot of left-side hitters step up to the challenge after a few injuries have left a hole.”
Jupiter led the team in kills and points last season as a freshman, which, Haley said, gave him confidence that she is ready to step up this season.
Junior Geena Urango’s high jump is also showing potential as a weapon for the Women of Troy, which has her in the pack of prospects for an outside hitter position, along with freshman Katie Fuller, junior Kimmee Roleder and Jupiter.
Something unexpectedalso happened during the offseason to improve the team’s depth: the freshmen came in ready to compete.
“This preseason the freshmen made a huge impact on the team,” Haley said. “And that never happens right when freshmen come out to play. They all came in with the energy and responsibility to compete with the team, and it changed the way the team worked together.”
The biggest change to the initial roster was the switch of setter this season.
Senior Taylor Carico announced at the end of last season that she planned to transfer to the University of Minnesota for her final season. Her explanation was that she was looking for a change of scenery and new experiences, though rumors circulated that she might have been unhappy with the Trojan program.
Whatever the reason, Carico’s departure left a void in the roster that has been filled by sophomore Kendall Bateman. Bateman played for the US Junior National team this summer and increased her speed and leadership capabilities, leaving Haley feeling confident in her ability to guide the team to some wins.
The team is hoping to start the season with some of those much sought-after wins as they head to East Lansing, Mich. for the Michigan State University showcase. This Friday they will play host Michigan State at 3:30 p.m., and will continue the tournament on Saturday by playing North Carolina at 9:30 p.m. and finally Albany at 2:30 p.m.
“Each team [in the tournament] is going to present us with a different challenge,” Haley said. “This tournament will show us what we need to work on the rest of the season. We have a chance to be really good, and I am excited to see what this group of players can do with the skills.”

The buzz was building on campus throughout the day, so by the time practice let out, true freshman Matt Barkley was practically mauled by media and fans alike.
All of the hoopla surrounding Barkley stemmed from the announcement by coach Pete Carroll that he would be the starting quarterback when USC opens its season Sept. 5 against San Jose State. Barkley will be the first true freshman to ever start a season opener for the Trojans.
Here to stay · 18-year-old Matt Barkley is slated to become the first true freshman quarterback to start a season opener for the Trojans. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Barkley, who enrolled at USC last spring to get a head start on his college career, said he had been looking forward to this moment since he arrived on campus.
“That’s what I came here in January hoping to do, so to finally get it was pretty special,” Barkley said.
Barkley said he had no idea that he would be named the starter today.
“[Carroll] told me after class,” Barkley said. “I just thought we were watching film or something, and [Carroll] told me, ‘Congratulations.’”
Redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp entered fall camp as the starter but suffered a knee injury and fell behind in the race to be the starting quarterback. Carroll said that the time Corp missed gave Barkley the opportunity to assert himself as the starter.
“It was a factor in that it created an opportunity for Matt to get all of the turns and reps so that he could grow so fast through the process,” Carroll said. “He had double the reps he would normally have, and he took full advantage of it.”
Barkley looked sharp in his first practice as the starting quarterback, connecting on a number of deep passes with the first team. He also threw a lot of short routes and had one of his passes intercepted.
Corp, meanwhile, had a solid practice as well but did not get as many reps with the first team. Carroll voiced his concerns yesterday about Corp’s mobility, and the sophomore seemed to continue to favor his leg.
That seemed to be the determining factor in Carroll’s decision.
“[Corp’s] done miraculously well just to be out here practicing, and I’m proud as can be of him,” Carroll said. “But at this time it’s clear to me that Matt’s well ahead, and it’s his job right now.”
Carroll clarified earlier in the day that this would not be a case of reevaluating Barkley after the San Jose State game on Sept. 5.
“He’s the starting quarterback at USC — it’s not a one-game deal,” Carroll said.
Barkley credited the competition with Corp and backup Mitch Mustain with pushing him to the spot he’s in now.
“I think [Corp] and Mitch have made me a better quarterback,” Barkley said.
Barkley, who is 18, will be expected to lead the high-powered Trojan offense, despite his age.
“He’s the general of our team, and he has to act like that,” said junior receiver Damian Williams. “He’s got to grow up now. I told him, ‘It’s not high school anymore. It’s time to play.’”
Everything seemed to fall into place for Barkley since he arrived on campus in January, starting with former USC quarterback Mark Sanchez’s decision to skip his senior season and enter the NFL draft. This paved the way for Barkley to battle it out with Corp for the starting spot.
Barkley ended spring practice second on the depth chart behind Corp, but the experience he gained by enrolling early would prove to be invaluable.
“It was huge to get that head start with the offense and the terminology,” Barkley said. “If I wasn’t here in January, I wouldn’t be in the picture.”
Barkley had learned enough in the spring that when Corp went down with the injury, he was prepared to make the most of his time.
Barkley will get his first shot as the starter in a game environment at the Trojans’ final team scrimmage at the Coliseum on Saturday at 12:30 p.m.

A nagging paranoia sometimes gnaws at the back of my mind when I’m seated in the most public of confessionals: the movie theater.
I briefly felt this subconscious anxiety during a recent showing of Hayao Miyazaki’s new animated film, Ponyo. The Japanese master’s latest — a story of an innocent friendship between an imaginative young boy and a talking fish — ranks alongside his famous My Neighbor Totoro as one of his most beautiful and child-friendly works.
Watching Miyazaki’s grand watercolor ode to the magic of the sea, a little childlike smile stuck itself on my face and, for less than two hours, I was trapped by the emotions of the three-year-old who would subject his mother to countless viewings of The Little Mermaid.
As I expressed this involuntary joy, I felt the eyes of judging adults moving over my smile and registering my laughs — an awkwardness that made me self-conscious of my appreciation of Ponyo.
Miyazaki’s latest innocent film stands as an anomaly among American releases, which have matured greatly in the wake of Pixar Animation Studio’s rise to prominence. Critics refer to this trend as a renaissance in animated filmmaking, a development that allows adults to enjoy animation for children on both levels.
Certainly Pixar’s recent masterpiece Up is among the most adult-friendly kids’ movies ever; its strange moments force kids to — among other things — differentiate between the complexities of reality and fantasy, such as in a seamlessly edited sequence where protagonist Carl Fredricksen imagines accidentally dropping his young ward Russell to his death. The tears I shed — another embarrassing admission to strangers around me — during the magnificent montage that opens Up came out for a far more cerebral reason than the strong, unsophisticated emotions I felt during Ponyo.
Pixar is actively raising the bar for its fans, and other studios are following suit. Even the sequel-happy, imagination-challenged drones at DreamWorks Animation assume a heavy knowledge of pop culture in their audiences for each Shrek film they churn out.
The blurring between adulthood and childhood is also on display in Square-Enix’s magnificent Kingdom Hearts video games: the blockbuster series which blends the realms of Disney and Final Fantasy into a strange brew of dark, long-winded Japanese RPG storylines populated by the likes of Donald Duck and Goofy. Replaying Kingdom Hearts II this summer — itself an emotional experience to be sure — sent me to YouTube in a nostalgic frenzy to review all the Disney classics the game references.
Beyond the decidedly adult moments found in children’s works across multiple mediums, all this forward progress in storytelling might be causing us to regress just a little bit. This relatively new attribute of children’s movies is drawing more adults to theaters and, consequently, putting us in touch with the children we once were. Even now, in my 20s, I feel inexorably drawn to Pixar and Miyazaki — who himself has effortlessly blended the world of children with adult themes in past films like Spirited Away.
The best children’s movies will always appeal to something deep in the mind of a child, past the synapses that control fart-joke laughter. It is to the credit of the filmmakers behind Up that the movie touches the same childlike center of the brain as Miyazaki’s films, particularly in its breathtaking scenes of both flight through the air and flight from danger that are common between the two.
Children’s movies are wonderful for this regression; there is great joy and great sorrow in reverting to the world of a child, even if only for a short two hours at 24 frames per second. Up and Ponyo induced a truly strong emotional reaction within me, with each reaction stemming from a different source. It seems that absorbing films like Up and Ratatouille on both an adult and childlike level allows one to enjoy My Neighbor Totoro and Ponyo on their own terms.
My old man, who is one of the great and forceful arbiters of a film’s quality for me, was excited to take our family out to every Disney or Pixar masterwork over the past 20 years. So, maybe it’s genetic.
Remembering his emotions and reactions, I know that when I sit my kids down to watch Ponyo, Up or, best of all, Beauty and the Beast for the first time — an event I will undoubtedly obnoxiously broadcast as momentous to whomever will listen — what unfolds on the screen will carry a similar emotional significance for me as it will for them.
The inevitable embarrassment of being an adult in an audience of kids cannot supersede the joy of watching a film like Ponyo or Up, no matter what age level of the psyche that joy springs from.
These films force us to smile with the child within, and they are priceless for it.

Everyone who has seen the film Legally Blonde knows the inspiring story of young Elle Woods’ triumph over the prejudices she faces as an attractive, blonde female. After being dumped by her boyfriend because she’s “not serious enough,” Elle fights her way into Harvard Law School, where she has to prove that she has the brains to match her beauty.
The 2001 film starring Reese Witherspoon, which was based on the novel of the same name by Amanda Brown, became a surprising pop culture hit.
Blond ambition · Becky Gulsvig stars as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde: The Musical, playing at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. - Photos courtesy of Broadway LA
In 2007, composers Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin teamed up with director and choreographer Jerry Mitchell to bring the tale of the gorgeous, driven law student to the stage. After a brief run in San Francisco, the unexpected musical pushed its way onto Broadway and, like Elle, became an instant success propelled by MTV’s special airing of the show.
Now, Legally Blonde: The Musical can be viewed in all its sparkly pink glory at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles for a limited run. The show has been re-choreographed by Mitchell specifically for the Pantages’ stage.
The film version of Legally Blonde gained a strong following when it was first released because the plot and character resonated with a wide range of audiences. It is the classic tale of the underdog — a success story that inspires those of us who feel patronized from time to time to fight for what we want. In addition, the character of Elle Woods is irrefutably endearing; she is optimistic, driven and not afraid to be herself — the ultimate 21st century role model for young women.
The stage version of the story beautifully encapsulates the charming elements of the film and translates it into an equally light-hearted and entertaining live show. While Legally Blonde: The Musical is hardly the most brilliant or original piece of work to grace the stage in recent years, the show accomplishes its mission to leave viewers with a warm and fuzzy feeling in their hearts.
The show stars Becky Gulsvig in the part of Elle and she does an incredible job of finding a sustainable balance in her character’s awkward yet well-intentioned charm. Gulsvig’s technical approach to her songs is spot-on, albeit a bit safe; one longs to hear more emotional power in her voice, particularly during Elle’s most vulnerable ballads.
Natalie Joy Johnson also shines as the woozy beautician Paulette who befriends Elle and encourages her not to give up on her law school dream.
Many songs are admittedly simplistic, somewhat forgettable and even a bit cringe-worthy — for example, “Take it Like a Man” is rather difficult to sit through. The show, however, does offer several standouts that are catchy enough to stick around and gleefully run on repeat in your head for weeks to come, such as “So Much Better,” a true power anthem for anyone who has ever been dumped or has failed at accomplishing a much-desired goal.
The one major change in the stage show is the addition of a Greek chorus that accompanies Elle on her journey to the school of “boring, ugly people” (Harvard, of course). The Greeks are imaginary apparitions of Elle’s Delta Nu sorority sisters from UCLA, played with alluring sizzle by Cortney Wolfson, Rhiannon Hansen and Crystal Joy. These three girls provide multiple musical interludes throughout the show, and they truly supply the majority of the play’s comedy and charm. Each Delta Nu girl has an individual spark that spices up the show’s plot and adds a bit of edge to the dialogue.
The dance numbers, particularly the grand display Elle presents to the Harvard admissions committee in “What You Want,” are upbeat and energetic, translating Elle’s enthusiasm of spirit through her hip-hop-inspired moves.
Legally Blonde: The Musical knows it is not going to be taken seriously, and embraces its silliness as part of its overwhelming appeal. Its charm is bound to reach the heart of the most critical, hot pink-despising audience member, as one cannot help but leave the theater with a smile.

Back when I was 10 years old, I took a nasty spill on my bike and felt a searing pain in my arm. Now I’m not a doctor, but I correctly diagnosed myself with a broken bone; I was right back then, so I figure I’m on about the level of a licensed physician by now.
This week, illness struck again; I was feeling feverish so I looked up my symptoms on my best friend, WebMD.com, to see if they matched up with this swine flu everyone has been talking about. Fever? Check. Headache? Check. Fatigue? Definitely. Sore throat? Phew, not yet.
Katie Kittrell | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately, I only need to fit two symptoms to possibly have the flu, meaning I wasn’t out of the woods yet. There was too much media coverage for me to think otherwise.
Of course, all my worrying proved futile when I actually looked up the statistics of swine flu.
First and foremost, a vast majority of cases are mild and don’t require medical treatment. In the five months since the H1N1 virus was first detected in the United States, there have been 522 deaths out of 7,983 hospital visits as of Aug. 21. Worldwide, there have only been 1,462 swine flu-related deaths out of the hundreds of thousands of reported cases. It doesn’t take a mathematician to tell you the odds of infection are minute.
Even if a person does happen to catch the swine flu, the risk of death is still rare if the person is in good health. In fact, of those thousands of US cases that were hospitalized with swine flu, 70 percent had a previous medical condition along the lines of diabetes, asthma or heart disease, putting them in the “high-risk” category for flu. Clearly, it pays to be in good health.
If one could choose from a group of various flu strains, it might be better to catch H1N1 instead of the regular old flu. Last year, the standard flu claimed 56,326 US lives. (Again, of the 200,000 hospitalized from the flu last year, only 849 did not have previous complications.) The numbers are in line with Washington’s prediction of 30,000-90,000 US deaths this year.
Though seniors often fall prey to the flu, the H1N1 strain hasn’t infected the senior population. It’s counterintuitive, but many scientists believe it may just be a statistical anomaly, considering healthy children and adults typically recover just fine from the disease. Then again, studies also show that the seniors’ resilience might come from the fact that many have already contracted the flu in their lifetimes.
Despite this, media outlets have taken this as an opportunity to dial up the “keep your children safe” angle to the extent that children in New York public schools are now bringing hand sanitizer with them in addition to their book bags and lunches, as if parents didn’t give kids enough reason to be scared of the outside world.
CNN even encourages the “ABCDs” of swine flu prevention: don’t stick your fingers in your mouth, always wash your hands, cover your mouth when you sneeze and don’t go to school while sick. Really, I’m pretty sure those double as the ABCDs of not being disgusting, too.
It’s hard not to get worked up over the possibility of a brutal flu season, especially with the media treating swine flu as if it were the second coming of the Asian flu that killed 2 million from 1957-1958 — in reality, it might just be the 2003 SARS debacle all over again.
Recall: CNN made a spectacle reporting that 8,000 people became sick worldwide, even releasing a story hypothesizing that SARS was from outer space. Of course, SARS failed to reach the deadly proportions projected by the network with barely eight people contracting the infection in the United States, all of whom traveled overseas.
If all the numbers are a little too much, we shouldn’t worry about it. The fact remains that people can only speculate as to what will happen with swine flu. Ultimately, we’re better off hitting the gym to keep up our health and canceling our cable subscription.

John Schulman is concerned his USC students will be smarter than he is.
“I’m always worried that they’ll know all the answers, that they’ll be miles ahead and I won’t be up to speed,” said Schulman, who will head USC’s new entertainment law program that opens next fall.
“No-nonsense” · Known around Hollywood as a straight-talker, John Schulman will head Gould’s new entertainment law program. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
But even in classes filled with second- and third-year students, Schulman’s USC Gould School of Law colleagues say it’s unlikely he will be outstripped.
Schulman retired from Warner Bros. last year after spending 25 years as general counsel and
executive vice president. He brings a weighty resume and a mile-long list of connections to Gould, said Robert K. Rasmussen, dean of Gould.
Schulman, who joined Gould in early August, has built a reputation in Los Angeles, he’s been called “straight-talking,” “no-nonsense” and even the “Jack Nicholson of the law world” during his time in the business.
“John really is a legend,” Rasmussen said. “Everyone knows John. I never cease to be amazed when I mention John’s name that no matter who I’m speaking to, they know who he is and they adore him.”
Rasmussen said he couldn’t imagine starting the new entertainment law program without Schulman’s influence. Students have already contacted him about taking classes in the program, he said, because Schulman’s reputation and resumé precede him.
“We always dream of hiring someone with talent and experience like John’s,” Rasmussen said. 	“There would not have been the level of enthusiasm without him at the helm.”
Schulman hopes to create the “best entertainment law school in the world,” blending lecture, hands-on learning and his own extensive experience into an in-depth look in how the entertainment industry intersects the legal world.
During Schulman’s years at Warner Bros., he launched, staffed and built the company’s legal department from the ground up. He worked on multiple
high-profile cases, including a case against Francis Ford Coppola that claimed breach-of-contract over the production of Pinocchio.
At one point, he oversaw roughly 150 people within the department. Those people, Rasmussen said, respected him highly.
“My alums who have worked at Warner Bros. say he was a great leader and a great trainer,” Rasmussen said. “And we know that translates well into the classroom.”
Until next fall, Schulman will work closely with professors within Gould, the USC Marshall School of Business and the USC School of Cinematic Arts to develop a curriculum focused on teaching law students how the entertainment industry intersects the legal world.
“It’s essential to me to have the support and involvement of people like Elizabeth Daley at the film school, people at the business school, they’ve all got to be involved to realize this program the way we envision it,” Schulman said.
Rasmussen said the spirit of collaboration at USC has made the path to cross-curricular planning between Gould, Marshall and SCA an easy one.
“The strength of USC is that we are completely willing — excited, actually — to be interdisciplinary, and that way we can reach across divisions that often are insurmountable at other universities,” Rasmussen said.
Law students will still come out with a J.D. in law, but with an emphasis on entertainment law, Schulman said. Courses within the program will be available starting next fall.
“I hope our classes teach them some more practical aspects of the entertainment industry and how it applies to law,” Schulman said. “I’ve seen a lot of problems that I hope tomorrow’s lawyers can anticipate, but I think these kids are current and up-to-date, and they’re going to be telling me what to do.”
The classes will emphasize tax and business law, Rasmussen said.
Schulman said the way the program will be structured also has yet to be decided, but he knows students who aren’t specializing in entertainment law will still be able to take classes.
“Right now, you can take a civic procedure class, even if you don’t want to be a prosecutor,” Schulman said. “This is much the same.”
Henrietta Wong, a first-year law student, said Schulman’s experience attracts her to the program.
“He brings real world expertise into the classroom,” Wong said. “I think it’s really exciting to have such a successful person from such a specialized field in the law school.”
Schulman is the most recent in a string of entertainment executives to come to Gould; Michael Grizzi, vice president of legal affairs for Paramount Pictures, Jeff Schneider, senior vice president of business affairs and general counsel for Lifetime Television, and Jonathan Stern, who provides legal council for Red Bull energy drinks, all teach at the school as well.

Two Keck School of Medicine professors have received separate million-dollar grants from a state research institution to fund stem cell research in USC labs.
Wange Lu, an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, and Martin Pera, the director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, received two out of 12 “Basic Biology” monetary awards given by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to research institutions throughout Southern California. Lu and Pera each received approximately $1.4 million to assist in their distinct topics of stem cell research.
Shelley Hough, a researcher working in Pera’s lab, said the two grants are crucial to Keck, as they continue their research.
“[The funding] came at a really important time,” Hough said.
Lu, who has been at Keck for three and a half years, will use his grant to lead a laboratory group in researching the process of transforming a human embryonic cell into a pluripotent stem cell, which is capable of maturing into almost any type of body cells. Though Lu has successfully executed this transformation before, he and his laboratory group will be studying the process to try to pick out the most important steps.
“We plan to work on exactly what was in the proposal … to study how skin cells can be changed into pluripotent cells,” Lu said.
Pera will use his grant to
advance his studies on the preliminary steps of cell renewal. Pera, with Hough as his assistant, is aiming to learn about the first events that occur in cell differentiation, the process where an embryonic cell develops a specific cell function.
Hough said a major hurdle in this research will be manipulating embryonic cells to become a desired cell type.
“We’re really trying to understand the fate choice of stem cells and how the cells’ microenvironment influences early fate choice,” Hough said.
Until recently, federal funding for stem cell research has been limited. Now, following President Obama’s reversal of a Bush administration policy restricting institutions from supporting embryonic stem cells that were created after
Aug. 9, 2001, money is more readily available. During the eight-year period, many researchers had limited cell lines ­— or a group of reproducing stem cells — and equipment.
“Researchers are more likely to do better research because they will have better stem cell lines,” Pera said.
The previous ban of new cell lines did not hinder Lu’s research directly because it induced pluripotent stem cells, the kinds of cells Lu studies, were not included in the cell lines that were restricted.
Although he was not directly affected by the ban, Lu said he feels that Obama’s decision and Proposition 71, which was passed in 2004 and allotted $3 billion to stem cell research in California universities, have driven the progression of stem cell research.
“It was very important to stem cell research,” Lu said. “The lift generally benefited the stem cell community in the US — the field will move forward faster.”

Severe budget cuts at the Los Angeles Fire Department could mean a slower rescue for USC students who dial 911, according to an LAFD engineer.
In order to relieve a $39 million budget deficit, earlier this month Los Angeles Fire Chief Douglas Barry began implementing rolling “brownouts” — temporary furloughs which will take up to 87 firefighters out of the daily work rotation and leave one battalion command team, three emergency battalion offices, 15 fire trucks and nine ambulances unstaffed every day for a year, according to myFOXla.com.
You’re fired · With LAFD’s new rolling “brownouts,” one of Station 15’s two fire engines will remain idle periodically, as some Station 15 staff members will be dispersed throughout the city’s many fire stations. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
At Station 15, the fire station on Jefferson Boulevard that services the USC area, this means periodically having only one engine and a smaller staff to work with.
Greg Sweet, an engineer at Station 15, said the station consists of a special task force and two engines. One of those engines operates together with a truck, known as the “light force.”
“When they do the brownout, they’ll shut the light force, so that’s six people on that company, with three shifts, not working,” Sweet said.
This cut represents more than 50 percent of the Station 15 staff, Sweet said. Although none of the staff  members at Station 15 were laid off, some will be spread out among other Los Angeles stations to fill vacancies during brownouts.
As a result, the station’s ability to respond quickly to calls that come in during brownouts could be severely impaired, Sweet said.
“There’s definitely an impact, especially now that school is in session. There are a lot of demands and emergency calls that are generated,” he said. “If we’re busy, if the engine is busy, they’ll have to get a company from another station, so there’ll probably be a delay.”
The nine day-long brownouts are set to occur on a rolling basis every three weeks. During brownouts, stations will also be expected to assist with calls across the city if the local stations in those areas are unable to respond. Responses, Sweet said, will likely be less immediate.
“Yesterday we went to a structural fire call on 50th Street and Budlong, which is way out of our district, and we were the first engine company on scene,” Sweet said. “We passed at least three or four other stations that should have been there prior to us, so that’s one example of the delay in getting somewhere.”
Derrick Matsuda, a graduate student studying electrical engineering who lives in Torrance and remembers being affected by local brush fires said he thought the cuts were a big issue.
“Maybe not right now, but if there ever were to be multiple fires, we’d be in trouble,” Matsuda said.
Paul Glavin, an undeclared sophomore, said he thought it was an unfortunate situation because students weren’t fully aware of the brownouts.
“I feel like people would be much more concerned about it if they were forced into the situation,” he said. “I would be furious if that situation actually came up. I would probably start an organization to get back the other engine.”
Sweet said he understood that the cuts were being made to fix the budget deficit, but they were also having a direct effect on the ability of the fire department to do its job.
“This is one solution. But this is what the department does — take care of all the people — and that’s where they’re cutting our resources,” he said.
Glavin said he would also prefer to have more fire trucks, but understood why the budget cuts were an important issue to locals.
“I don’t pay taxes, so personally I don’t care. I would like to see more fire trucks, but I also understand if other people were mad because they would have to pay higher taxes,” he said.

Three USC students were held at gunpoint early Thursday morning when a group of armed robbers entered their apartment and stole thousands of dollars worth of electronics.
Just before 5 a.m., one of the robbers climbed onto the second-story  balcony of the 29th Street apartment and entered through an unlocked sliding door, according to USC’s Department of Public Safety.
Robbery ·  Armed robbers climbed onto the balcony of a 29th Street student apartment and entered through the unlocked sliding door. - Dan Loeterman | Daily Trojan
After putting his gun to a student’s head and leading him into the living room, the robber unlocked the front door for at least one accomplice.
The robbers, wearing dark clothing, then woke up two other students, forced them into the living room and instructed them to lie face down on the floor.
While at least one robber gathered the property — which included two laptops and some sound mixing equipment — another guarded the students, holding them on the floor at gunpoint.
After they took the valuables, the men fled the scene on foot. The students called the Los Angeles Police Department immediately.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said this robbery was abnormal because of the time it occurred.
“It is unusual for a robbery to occur that late in the morning,”  Carlisle said.
USC recently began placing security guards at some street corners near campus to reduce crime, but the guards were off duty at the time the robbery occurred.
The guards were added in the wake of a series of high-profile crime incidents that occurred over the last year.
LAPD robbery detectives are currently investigating. According to Carlisle, LAPD also brought in additional resources to assist in the investigation. The investigation is being led by Det. Flores of the LAPD Southwest division.
Denzil Suite, associate vice president for the Office of Student Affairs, stressed the importance of staying generally alert, and said counseling and other resources are available for victims and family if needed.
“This is a situation that is fairly unusual for us,” Suite said. “…But as always I think it’s a reminder we all need to be vigilant about safety at any point.”

Misinformation
As a former undergraduate tour guide and current graduate tour guide, I found Lucy Mueller’s opinion piece, “A Step Forward for Tours,” from Aug. 25 to be over simplified and, in some cases, presumptuous to a point that demonstrates a lack of understanding for the job. Mueller stated that other campuses, such as Hendrix College in Arkansas, are instating a new type of tour that differs from USC’s policies of walking backwards and informing. She criticizes our USC tour guides for walking backwards on tours. Yet, she fails to mention why other, smaller schools are instating this new ambulatory policy.  Tours at these small schools are much smaller than the ones we give here. According to a Hendrix College admissions representative, their tours are often one person, but 10 is an accurate average for a given tour. With such a small audience, not facing your listeners, rudeness aside, might be possible to those with a behemoth voice. But here at USC, most of the tours given have 35 people, sometimes more. So, imagine trying to talk to 35 people while not facing them. A tour will do no good if the person taking it cannot hear the tour guide because they are not even facing their audience. Facts aside, my mother always taught me never to turn my back on someone you are speaking to, especially in a professional sense.
Mueller has also criticized the USC tours by saying, “perhaps instead of talking to potential students, guides should initiate a conversation with them.” If Mueller had taken our tours and stayed until the end she would have coincidently noticed that the guide often stays for 10 minutes or more simply talking to anyone on their tour who has a question. I know, in my years of tour guiding, I’ve stayed half an hour after a tour talking to a family who had apprehensions. I had one tour where a potential student approached me afterwards and told me the tour made him decide to come here. We still keep in touch and he was at a get-together at my apartment just a week ago.
Finally, Mueller seems to disagree with the use of the facts on our tours by saying, “Guides unfailingly mention that the VKC globe makes it the tallest building on campus, that CTCS 466 … is the most popular class in the university.”  But to be fair, we also discuss study abroad programs, housing on campus and off, the history of the school, financial aid, every academic department, scholarships, graduate programs, the career planning and placement center, jobs and clubs on campus, research for undergraduates, notable faculty, the greater Los Angeles area, sports on campus and much more. Because, ultimately, potential students come to a campus tour for information, not to have their tour guide turn their back on them and make small talk for an hour.

Kevin O’Neill doesn’t know when or how the NCAA will conclude its ongoing investigation of the USC athletic program. But the USC basketball coach knows that his opposition is using the window of uncertainty against him.
After hitting the summer recruiting trail, O’Neill said several prospects told him that opposing coaching staffs had negatively recruited against USC by bringing up the investigation. Many even speculated about an eventual punishment for the program.
Foundation · Coach Kevin O’Neill said he had to solidify this year’s roster first, which includes the leading returner scorer Dwight Lewis. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“[Coaches] are saying we’re going to get everything from a hanging and lynching at noon to receiving the death penalty,” O’Neill said, referring to the NCAA’s harshest form of punishment. In the past 25 years, the Southern Methodist football program is the only Division-1 athletic team to receive the death penalty, which can entail shutting down a program for as many as two years.
O’Neill was unable to provide recruits with updates on the ongoing investigation, but said that he told them it was the only real roadblock the program was facing, a key reason he decided to take the job in the first place.
“I don’t know what went on before I got here. I’m just concentrating on what happens from here on out,” O’Neill said. “You have a great athletic tradition here, and with the facilities, location and the league, it’s one of those jobs where I think you can compete for a national title.”
Whether recruits would respond to O’Neill’s message of moving forward still “remains to be seen,” according to the coach, but his hard work has already proved fruitful.
The first-year coach reeled in two commitments over the summer after taking in a one-man recruiting class this year. Curtis Washington, a center from Kentucky, has verbally committed to USC as a rising high school senior, and Gelaun Wheelwright has pledged to join the Trojans in 2011.
While making sure his next recruiting classes are well-stocked was important to O’Neill, preventing player defections after the coaching transition was his most important task. The mission took him across the country and even overseas to meet with players’ families.
“We had to stabilize our roster and get this year’s team straight,” O’Neill said. “The blueprint is to concentrate on skill development with the guys who are here.”
All of the returning players who had not elected to enter the NBA draft decided to stay on board, including forward Marcus Johnson. Despite being granted another year of eligibility, the senior had flirted with the idea of playing professionally before eventually deciding to stay at USC.
But the team will still have to find a way to stir the interest of the public, which was apathetic for long stretches of last season’s NCAA Tournament team. Attendance at the Galen Center dwindled as the regular season drew to a close, and O’Neill believes there’s only one way to improve it.
“You just have to win. That’s the way it is in a pro city,” O’Neill said. “If you win, people come out.”
USC’s schedule, however, may prove humbling for the team in the early going. The Trojans must travel to Texas and play host to Tennessee; both teams are expected to be ranked in the top 10 when preseason polls are released. A rematch in Atlanta with Georgia Tech, which is expected to be greatly improved as it welcomes freshman phenom Derrick Favors to an already talented team, is also on the schedule.
The schedule was likely devised when the team believed it would have fewer NBA defections and more incoming recruits, O’Neill said, but the team has to press forward.
“They’re still going to be tipping it up on those days no matter what,” O’Neill said.
Despite all of the challenges he faces in his first year, O’Neill received a vote of confidence from a friend and former colleague.
“He’ll do really well there at USC and make the Pac-10 that much tougher,” said Josh Pastner, who served as an assistant coach to O’Neill at Arizona in 2007 and is now the head coach at Memphis. “Everyone’s saying they’re down, but I think they have some good talent coming back. With Kevin  coaching, they’re going to be in every game and have a chance to win every time.”
