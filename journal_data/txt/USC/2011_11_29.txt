After nearly two months at sea, Katrina Edwards, a professor of biological and earth sciences, returned home Nov. 19 from a research expedition in the North Pond of the mid-Atlantic Ridge.

Edwards traveled to the remote location to install three circulation obviation retrofit kits, which allow researchers to continuously observe marine life through a permanent tube on the sea floor.
“The installation of the CORKs observatories was challenging, because it’s such a complicated process,” Edwards said. “When you actually install it, it’s a marathon in terms of work. You basically are awake from the time you start and the time you complete the installation, and that can be anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.”
Working with 120 people aboard the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program’s flagship Joides Resolution, Edwards and co-chief scientist Wolfgang Bach of Bremen University in Germany, led the international team of researchers from more than a dozen nations.
The large and far-reaching endeavor establishes a spot for USC at the forefront of marine research, Edwards said.
“This expedition, both the international character of it and the riskiness of it, puts [USC] at the cutting edge of what the research world is today,” Edwards said. “It definitely puts us at the forefront of international leaders of world-class research. As we move toward a more global economy and global social structure, we are also moving to a more international research environment.”
In studying the microbiology of how life thrives beneath sub-seafloor sediments and rocks, the team had access to samples using cutting edge molecular and micro-biological techniques that have thus far eluded science, Edwards said.
“This was really our first opportunity to go out there and use all the modern tools and technologies we have to offer to address these kinds of questions,” Edwards said.
Though the expedition took six years of planning and the installation took two months, the project is far from over. Edwards and her colleagues will be collecting data from the North Pond CORKs for the next four to 10 years, drilling more than 4.5 kilometers deep for volcanic, igneous rock samples.
“Now, our real work begins,” Edwards said. “We had a great expedition, but mainly we only initiated the experiments, but now is when we actually have to do the experiments and analyze the samples.”
Edwards has received 10 boxes of samples from the Atlantic to analyze, the results from which will be eventually compiled with other collected data to form several publications. Until then, the samples will be kept safely frozen, awaiting analysis by researchers.
Edwards will present her initial results of the expedition to the American Geophysical Union meeting, the largest geophysical conference worldwide, next week.

A faculty committee will begin working to revise the current G.E. curriculum at the start of spring 2012 to create a curriculum with more modern applications to students.
Committee members will likely be named within the next couple weeks, said Gene Bickers, the vice provost for undergraduate programs.
“The key is to have a curriculum that is in tune with students’ current needs,” Bickers said. “What was appropriate in the 1980s or 1990s might not be appropriate now, and the goal of the committee will be to keep the curriculum in sync with current needs.”
Bickers said another goal of the G.E. revision would be to make the curriculum more specialized and applicable to the various majors offered at the university.
“One thing the committee will look at is to allow students to tie in specialized material from their specific major with overall questions about society,” Bickers said. “[Students with] majors including engineering or communication could use the material they learn in their G.E. classes to create connections with their major.”
Bickers also said USC students would have the opportunity to voice their opinions on what they want to see in future curriculum.
“There will be forums concerning the curriculum revision and there will be a chance for USG to make comments on the revision process,” Bickers said. “During the last G.E. revision there were open forums, and we’re also looking to possibly allow students to make comments online.”
The last revision committee was chosen in 1994, and Bickers said they took three years to finish revising the curriculum.
The current G.E. curriculum’s lack of course variety forces many students to take classes that actually interest them, according to Monica Stainer, a freshman majoring in accounting.
“The G.E. curriculum right now is a great way for people to expand their knowledge on general topics; however, there are certain flaws with the program,” Stainer said. “One thing I would change is to offer more courses or seats in each class so the G.E. requirements can be fulfilled in ways that interest students, rather than taking the courses that are leftover.”
David Crary, a senior majoring in economics and applied and computational mathematics, also said the G.E. program could be improved, specifically by revising the curriculum’s link to the Writing 140 course.
“Nearly everyone complains about Writing 140, so obviously the committee could revise the GE-VI course with Writing 140 to better please most students,” Crary said. “One of the main problems with a school as distinct as USC is that there is so much diversity and interests that it will be difficult to provide classes that will be relevant to every student.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate introduced a proposal that will recommend USC add a two- to four-day fall break in October at its Tuesday meeting, one of many proposals USG leaders plan to push for in the upcoming semester.

With their term more than halfway complete, USG leaders plan to continue working on several other projects, especially adding tram shelters, increasing Ronald Tutor Campus Center hours and creating a resource center for transfer students.
USG president Monish Tyagi said it takes time to accomplish these projects because they require coordination from different campus departments, which each have different abilities to allocate resources.
Tyagi said USG will achieve their second semester goals by building upon what he considers to be the organization’s greatest achievement this semester: fostering stronger relationships with administrators and students.
At the start of the year, Tyagi and USG Vice President Logan Lachman arranged one-on-one meetings with administrators, which established the relationships they needed to discuss smoking policy, bike policy and stainability issues.
“We focused on building those relationships early on in the year and [relying] on them as the year went on,” Tyagi said.
Tyagi said, as a result of the open dialogue, the administration has been willing to work with USG in possibly extending campus center hours.
“We could see that project come to fruition, hopefully, in the spring,” Tyagi said.
Despite success in developing key relationships, several proposals, such as the installation of tram centers and more ATMs on campus, are currently stalled or still in the early stages, as the parties involved work to settle issues with logistics and funding.
While USG has been advocating the creation of tram shelters at USC shuttle stops, funding issues have delayed the project.
“There are a lot of hoops you have to jump through in terms of space, funding and timing,” Tyagi said. “We are trying to figure out where funding is going to come from for that.”
The same is true with the installation of more ATMs on campus, a project that is still in the planning stages. Tyagi said contracts and other details must be worked out before the proposal can proceed.
Another goal of Tyagi’s administration was to continue to increase USG’s presence on campus through surveys, forums, social media and the USG website.
Tyagi said the annual Council of Presidents event, which was attended this year by nearly 100 student leaders and President C. L. Max Nikias, displayed the strength of relationships USG aims to create through its lobbying efforts.
“That was a great capstone event for some of the relationships we have been able to form this year with students and administrators,” Tyagi said.
Despite the effort to make the organization more transparent, some students said they feel USG does not effectively communicate its advocacy efforts to students.
“I know they work hard, but I don’t think they inform us about what they are actually doing,” said Isabel Espinosa, a senior majoring in international relations and economics.
USG wants to develop a resource center for transfer students, but because they are unlikely to find a physical space, Tyagi said USG will work to create an online resource center by compiling information about different aspects of the university, ranging from housing to class registration.
“There’s a big need [to better inform transfer students] on campus, and I would like to see that achieved before we are out of office.” Tyagi said.
Lachman said the USG Senate will play a role in helping the organization achieve its goals next semester by passing resolutions, which formally communicate the student body’s opinion to the administration.
Future planned resolutions include creating a campus activities calendar and one to encourage the university to use fair trade practices, Senator Pro Tempore Vinnie Prasad said.
Though the senate has passed fewer resolutions than in past years, Lachman said they should be evaluated on the quality of those resolutions, not the amount. USG recently passed a resolution advocating for the clarification of smoking policy, which Lachman said was well received by the administration.
With the current USG term winding down and elections in February, Tyagi said his administration will continue working to meet its goals.
“The year’s not over,” Tyagi said. “It can easily look like this is the end of the year, but we still have a lot of work ahead.”

The USC women’s basketball team snapped a three-game losing skid with a 41-point thrashing over Gardner-Webb in the Bahamas last weekend. Now it hopes to live up to its preseason expectations starting tonight at Galen Center against the University of Texas at San Antonio.
The Women of Troy have (2-3) struggled to put together a consistent performance in their previous four contests. The victory over Gardner-Webb was perhaps their strongest showing of the year, as they put up a season-high 82 points.
“Our biggest strength is sticking together and playing as a team,” senior guard Briana Gilbreath said. “Against Gardner-Webb we started playing as a team. When we do that, I think we can beat anybody.”
The Roadrunners are led by the efforts of Ashley Spaletta, who is averaging 10.3 points per game. In their last game, Spaletta hit four 3-pointers en route to 16 points.
“The bottom line is that we got to win the Trojan way,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “When we play against teams that aren’t ranked, we have to insert our will on them from the start.”
The Women of Troy never trailed in their last game against the Runnin’ Bulldogs (2-4), and look to keep some of that momentum heading into tonight.
“[I’m looking for the team] to play a complete game, and do the things we worked on in practice,” Cooper said. “The key is to rebound — we need to limit them to one shot per possession.”
Heading into Wednesday’s matchup, UTSA is averaging 51.5 points per game, while the Women of Troy average 63 points. The Roadrunners barely scraped a victory in their last game against Detroit capturing a 59-55 victory. Throughout the season, however, UTSA has shot just under 28 percent from the field.
The Women of Troy’s offense, which has struggled at times, might not match up against top-ranked teams, but USC hopes to perform well enough to stop its opponent. The home advantage will help, according to the coaching staff.
“We got to take advantage and win [at home] because it’s hard on the road no matter who you’re playing,” Cooper said. “Good teams win on the road, championships are won on the road.”
The USC team has seen strong showings from its top players even in some of the team’s losses.
Gilbreath is now one career steal away from No. 9 spot in the USC history books, and No. 5 in all-time career blocks, while senior guard Ashley Corral is No. 15 overall in career points with 1,252.
“Hopefully in these games we can focus more on executing our offense and sticking with our defensive scheme,” Gilbreath said. “We just have to execute what [the coaches] tell us to execute.”
Besides hiding the article in the middle of the paper, no one will ever know when the game starts because the article never says.  At least put the start time when talking about the next game

Brimming with inexperience, the USC men’s basketball team has struggled to establish its offensive identity thus far. Through seven games, the Trojans (3-4) have averaged 57.1 points per game average — a drop from its 66.2 points per game average a season ago.

“I think offensive consistency is going to come with experience,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “The fact of the matter is we lost 90 percent of points, rebounds and assists [from last year’s team]. It’s tough to be great offensively when that happens. It’s going to take a little bit of time.”
Aside from sophomore guard Maurice Jones and redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller, who average 16.0 and 13.9 points per game respectively, the Trojans have received sporadic scoring contributions from their other players. USC’s third leading scorer, redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon, at 7.7 points per game, scored 15 points against South Carolina, but, in the three previous games, scored a total of nine.
“We played a lot of good basketball at the Las Vegas Invitational,” O’Neill said. “[Dedmon] and [Fuller] fouled out in the UNLV game with seven minutes left when it was a two-point game. I thought we played well there, and had a big win against South Carolina. [Dedmon’s] improving, and hopefully he can become more of a scoring option for us.”
Imbued with confidence after salvaging a .500 record at the Las Vegas Invitational, the USC men’s basketball team heads to Riverside tonight to square off against UC Riverside (2-4) at 7 p.m. UC Riverside, on Sunday afternoon, rallied to erase a 14-point, second-half deficit against Washington State to win 64-63.
“UC Riverside is coming off a big win against Washington State,” O’Neill said. “They’re a team that’s very well-coached. We’re playing at their place. In college basketball, when you’re on the road anywhere, it’s going to be a tough game.”
Senior guard Phil Martin leads UC Riverside in scoring, averaging 14.3 points. The Highlanders’ calling card, however, is their defense, as they allow just 58.8 points per game.
As usual, USC will rely heavily on Jones, who was named Pac-12 Player of the Week on Monday after averaging 19 points and three assists in three games.
“[Jones] is a guy who would rather play off the ball than on the ball,” O’Neill said. “But, with [Fontan] out, he’s forced to play all of the minutes with ball in his hand. What’s going to be important is that [Jones] develops as a young player. He’s still a sophomore. The more he steps up offensively, the better we’re going to be.”
good luck tonight. I hope to see you there wearing my usc gear.

You could first see it in the press room following USC’s 31-17 win over Notre Dame in October.
Return to Troy · In two seasons since arriving in Los Angeles as USC’s head coach, Lane Kiffin has compiled an overall mark of 18-7. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
It was there again on the field after the Trojans’ 38-35 upset of Oregon in Eugene.  It was as wide as ever when USC led UCLA by 50 late in the fourth quarter on Saturday: it being a smile on USC coach Lane Kiffin’s face.
There’s been plenty for the normally stoic Kiffin to feel good about over the final two-thirds of the Trojans’ 2011 season.
It’s a drastic turnaround from where he was only two months ago.
The low point came in late September. The Trojans had just suffered a 43-22 shellacking on the road at Arizona State — the culmination of an ugly start to the season that saw USC need to hold on late to beat less-than-stellar Minnesota and Utah at the Coliseum.
There were questions from the Trojan faithful about whether Kiffin was the right guy for the job. After all, this was the guy whose only two previous head coaching ventures ended in him being called a liar (by late Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis) and causing a near riot (by angry Tennessee fans).
There was the fact that it was former athletic director Mike Garrett who hired Kiffin to replace Pete Carroll in January 2010 and Pat Haden might have wanted a different man in charge of the program.
And, there was Kiffin’s pedestrian 11-6 record over his first 17 games at USC.
All of that seems so long ago. USC went 7-1 over the final eight games of the season and Kiffin is now being talked about as the possible national coach of the year, an award that would be richly deserved. While UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State have all fired their coaches this season, there are no doubts about Kiffin’s job security. The freshmen and sophomore laden Trojans could be a preseason top-five team in 2012.
So, just how did he do it? How exactly did the 36-year-old Kiffin, still the youngest head coach of the 120 in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, take a Trojan program on the verge of sanction-strapped mediocrity and return it to the doorstep of its former glory in less than two years?
It started with recruiting — just not the traditional kind. First, Kiffin convinced his dad, defensive guru Monte Kiffin, and recruiting maven Ed Orgeron to head west with him and join his coaching staff at USC.
Then, when the sanctions hit in June 2010, the coaches had to persuade Trojan juniors and seniors to pass on a free transfer to another school — a veritable get out of NCAA jail free card — and play out the remainder of their college careers with no chance at a national title or bowl game. A few transferred, but the majority stayed.
Kiffin and company also had to hold together what they could of the 2010 recruiting class, most members of which committed to play for a sanctions-free USC coached by Carroll.
That group included record-setting sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods (Pac-12 best 111 catches for 1,292 yards and 15 touchdowns in 2011), two-headed starting tight end combo redshirt freshmen Randall Telfer and Xavier Grimble (a combined nine touchdowns) and defensive stalwarts sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey and freshmen linebackers Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard — three of the Trojans’ top four tacklers this season.
An 8-5 season in his first year in charge was a disappointment for Kiffin, so with no bowl game to play in, he and his staff climbed into planes, trains and automobiles and traversed the country, selling the USC program to the nation’s top high school and junior college talent.
The recruiting efforts resulted in a mammoth 30-player class that included Pac-12 Co-Offensive Freshman of the Year wide receiver Marqise Lee (73 catches for 1,143 yards and 11 touchdowns), first-year starters freshman Lamar Dawson (linebacker), freshman Marcus Martin (offensive guard) and junior Isiah Wiley (cornerback) and special teams standouts freshman Andre Heidari (first-team All-Pac-12 kicker) and junior punter Kyle Negrete (zero touchbacks in 2011).
Scholarship reductions — part two of the NCAA sanctions — will hit the Trojans next season, making the coaches’ decisions in evaluating high school talent even more crucial in the three years to come.
Kiffin’s most important recruiting job this offseason though, will be with players already on the USC roster. Heisman-hopeful junior quarterback Matt Barkley and three All-Pac-12 First Team performers — junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil, redshirt junior defensive end Nick Perry and junior safety T.J. McDonald — could bypass their final year of eligibility and head to the NFL.
Kiffin has said he wants to help each player make the best decision for himself. That doesn’t mean, though, that the coach won’t remind his players of how special the 2012 Trojans could be.
Whether or not Barkley and friends return for their senior seasons, Kiffin has shown that he is the right man for the job. Less than two years after crippling NCAA sanctions, he’s put USC back in the national spotlight.
That’s something even Kiffin can smile about.

Fresh off a 423-yard, six-touchdown performance in a blowout victory against UCLA, it’s hard to argue that junior quarterback Matt Barkley isn’t worthy of some Heisman consideration.
But in this year’s talented pool of Heisman contenders, even with Barkley’s impressive numbers — his 39 touchdown passes mark a single-season Pac-12 record — it’s unlikely he’ll win the award or be chosen as one of the four finalists sent to New York City on Dec. 10.
Fair or not, USC’s postseason ban has a negative effect on Barkley’s Heisman chances. Though Angelenos won’t soon forget the Trojans’ 50-0 rout over the Bruins, Heisman voters in different regions of the country are already turning their attention to conference championships and bowl game matchups. So with every touchdown pass from Houston’s Case Keenum or Baylor’s Robert Griffin III this coming weekend, Barkley’s career-best statistics will slowly fade into the back of the minds of college football lovers.
Heisman ballots are due Dec. 5, the day after the BCS announces participants in the national championship game, the Rose Bowl and more. It’s a symptom of the fickle nature of college football — with so much emphasis on each week’s slate of games, falling behind in the slightest can leave a worthy Heisman nominee such as Barkley on the outside looking in.
But even in a hypothetical scenario in which Heisman voters would be able to holistically evaluate a player’s body of work, Barkley comes up short compared to some of the other candidates. For each of his brilliant efforts against Colorado, Oregon and UCLA, there’s another less-than-stellar game for pundits to nitpick. Barkley threw two interceptions and just one touchdown in a blowout loss to Arizona State earlier this season, and accounted for less than 200 yards passing in games against California and Washington. It’s easy to point to USC’s victories in those latter Pac-12 battles, but Barkley wasn’t a driving force behind either win — it was USC’s defense.
Perhaps most of all, the Trojans’ triple-overtime loss at home against Stanford likely keeps Barkley beneath Cardinal quarterback Andrew Luck in the voting process, despite that USC’s signal caller has more total passing yards and touchdowns than his Pac-12 rival. As for the other candidates expected to beat out Barkley, Griffin III, Keenum and Alabama running back Trent Richardson all have a more complete résumés than USC’s field general. Griffin has managed to throw for more than 400 yards in games against No. 10 Oklahoma and No. 3 Oklahoma State. He has 3,678 passing yards and more than 600 rushing yards, propelling a fairly small football program into the top-25.
Richardson finished the season with more than 1,500 rushing yards and 23 total touchdowns, eclipsing 100 yards rushing nine times and had four games where he accounted for at least three scores. And Houston’s Keenum has his Cougars at a perfect 12-0, while leading the nation in passing yards (4,726) and passing touchdowns (43). Even more impressively, he’s only been picked off three times.
If Barkley returns for his senior season, he’ll have the chance to lead the Trojans to a BCS title and possibly win the Heisman Trophy too. For now, however, it looks as if Barkley is rightfully on track to finish somewhere around fifth when the final votes are tallied this time around.

To be clear: USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley isn’t going to win the Heisman Trophy on Dec. 10.
There are too many obstacles stacked against him. The odds, quite frankly, are too steep. But that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t win the award.

USC’s lack of postseason eligibility isn’t enough to dampen Barkley’s Heisman Trophy-caliber season. A closer look at the race reveals that no one is more deserving of college football’s highest individual award. Stanford’s Andrew Luck might be the better NFL prospect, but that’s not what the Heisman Trophy honors. The Heisman distinction goes to the “most outstanding” player in college football, and that’s exactly what Barkley has been in 2011.
In comparison to Luck, Barkley’s case only grows stronger. Barkley had more touchdown passes (39 to Luck’s 35) and fewer interceptions (seven to nine) than his Pac-12 counterpart. Luck’s completion percentage was less than 1 percent higher than Barkley’s.
Luck faltered slightly in the final stretch of the season, while Barkley excelled, throwing 20 touchdowns (including two six-score games) during USC’s final five contests. A few weeks ago, it was in doubt whether Barkley would even be a finalist for the Heisman. His strong finish has made it almost a guarantee that he’ll make the trip to New York.
Perhaps even more mind-boggling, in the eight games since a late September loss at Arizona State, Barkley has completed 207 of 297 passes for 2,409 yards, 29 touchdowns and a mere four interceptions.
Though it remains true that Barkley’s Trojans lost to Luck’s Cardinal on Halloween weekend, it took three overtimes and a heartbreaking fumble from redshirt junior tailback Curtis McNeal for a supposedly superior Stanford team to beat Barkley’s boys. The same voters and columnists who tout star wide receivers sophomore Robert Woods and freshman Marqise Lee as evidence that Barkley had more to work with should note the edge in experience and superior running game that allowed Luck to operate much more comfortably.
“None of the other guys around the country have to deal with all these players leaving because of sanctions and probation and all these young guys around them and no bowl game to go to,” USC coach Lane Kiffin pointed out a week ago after USC’s stirring win over Oregon. “[Barkley’s] playing as well as anybody in the country, especially in big games with a very young unit around him.”
The point is both teams knew USC’s offense revolved around Barkley getting the ball to one of two dangerous receivers. In spite of that, the junior from Newport Beach still found a way to play 11 phenomenal games, with a 43-22 loss to the Sun Devils serving as the only real blemish on his résumé. On offense, Lee and redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer did not look their age thanks to Barkley’s efficiency and leadership as a passer.
Detractors of Barkley’s chances to win cite the fact that he’ll be “off the radar” during conference championship week, and his candidacy will lose some of its buzz as a result of the Trojans’ postseason ban. But shouldn’t that very bowl ban only strengthen his candidacy? Despite every obstacle, Barkley put together a season, statistically speaking, that was superior to performances from USC’s other two Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart. And he handled all of it with the poise you’d want out of a college quarterback.
“I know it sounds weird, but I look up to Matt Barkley,” Kiffin said during Saturday’s post-game press conference.

There has long been a tension in higher education between full-time, tenure-track professors who have dedicated their lives to research and teaching, and part-time adjuncts, who typically take up teaching as a secondary career and don’t receive health or retirement benefits.
From 1975 to 2009, the proportion of part-time faculty in U.S. higher education institutions increased from 24 to 41.1 percent, a trend the American Association of University Professors calls “the establishment of a subordinate tier of faculty members.”
The number of adjuncts is high at USC, too — 33 percent of university faculty are part-time and have no tenure or tenure-track designation.
A New York Times book review published in April describes adjunct professors as “holders of advanced degrees who are lured in by the prestige of college teaching, hired on a piecework basis, paid low wages and shut out of academic decision-making.”
But Martin Levine, vice provost for faculty affairs, said that description does not typically apply to adjuncts at USC.
“Many of these people have very active careers of their own,” Levine said. “They usually have marvelous experience and … are delighted to come in and work with students.”
Organizations such as the American Association of University Professors condemn the increase in adjunct hires because they say it means more doctoral graduates are shouldering the burden of teaching without possibility for tenure.
That ranking of positions has traction in English, according to Margaret Russett, a professor and chair of the English department.
“A tenure-track job is the gold standard,” Russett said. “That’s what one would prefer, all things being equal.”
Technically, USC’s English department employs no adjuncts; the division is between tenure-track and non-tenure-track full-time faculty, a practice Russett said the university encourages other departments to adopt.
Many students do not realize that “adjunct” designates just one type of non-tenure-track faculty who do not have a long-term contract with USC. Other titles include lecturer, visiting professor and research professor, all of which the university can confer without offering the salary and benefits typically afforded to tenure-track hires.
The tenure-track job as the “gold standard” is true in English, as well as most social science and humanities disciplines. But Sofus Macskassy, a professor who recently moved into a full-time position at the Viterbi School of Engineering’s Information Sciences Institute, said computer science and technology Ph.D. graduates are often indifferent to the tenure race.
“[Computer scientists who take adjunct professorships] just keep their foot in the door, they get their secondary income, they get to keep [on top of] what’s going on in the research community,” Macskassy said.
For years, Macskassy willingly worked as an assistant adjunct professor in computer science while holding a research position at a startup company. Though he always aimed to become a full-time professor, he also saw the industry-and-academia combination as ideal for recruiting outstanding students into the profession.
In the computer science department, Macskassy said, adjuncts “don’t have any responsibilities. You can teach if you want to and you can do research if you want to, it’s basically an association.”
Ted Ancona, an adjunct instructor of music industry, said the music school hires many instructors from outside to teach just one instrument. Ancona was himself a classical music recording engineer for KUSC when the university asked him to step in and teach a class about his niche specialty.
“If you know everything about history you may focus on that, but in the cinema school or electronics or music industry, there’s a lot of development in the field you’re not caught up with [being in academia],” Ancona said.
Adjuncts have been recipients of the prestigious Teaching and Mentoring Awards granted by the USC Parents Association, Levine said. The shame of not being tenured might change as tenured jobs disappear.
“I don’t think this phenomenon [of tenure decline] is going to go away, and we’re all going to have to adjust to it,” Russett said.

Private universities often pay big bucks to keep top administrators; in 2008, 30 presidents at private colleges earned more than $1 million, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. Typically, decisions about compensation at private universities aren’t announced to the public, but all private, non-profit universities are required to file forms with the IRS to maintain their tax-exempt statuses. Those forms, the Form 990, contain information about all aspects of a university’s finances, including the salaries of the highest paid executives.
Below is a list of the top 10 earners at USC in fiscal year 2009, the most recent year for which data is available. (Because of filing deadlines and extensions, 990 forms are typically not publicly accessible until a year or two after the reporting year.) The amounts listed describe total compensation, which is the sum of base salary, bonuses and incentives, deferred compensation, other compensation and nontaxable benefits. Administrators’ positions are listed according the job they held in 2009.

The title “One of the most original filmmakers of postwar American cinema” isn’t something that you gain by making predictable, safe films.
Interestingly enough, American filmmaker Kenneth Anger gained that reputation through the production of short films. His influential work from the 1940s to the 1980s, some of which inspired directors such as Martin Scorcese and David Lynch, is currently on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art “Icons” exhibition. At times confusing, at times thrilling and always unpredictable, the small exhibition is a surprisingly thorough look into Anger’s work and the era in which he created his pieces.
Viewers are initially greeted by a large neon, Plexiglas piece with a metal mouth on a wall and the words “Hollywood Babylon” on them. The piece instantly sets the tone; Hollywood Babylon is the title of Anger’s book, a collection of celebrity scandal stories. Even if you don’t know that walking in, the giant lips and bright neon colors automatically link you to the flashy side of Hollywood and hint at Anger’s penchant for the intriguing and theatrical.
Before you see any of Anger’s actual videos, a room is dedicated to other interesting relics from his working era. Clustered on a wall is everything from tabloid and film magazine covers to pictures of famous and not-so-famous stars. The pieces somehow fit into a wall and visitors can pick up a laminated map for exploring the exhibition. Unfortunately, the wall is packed with pieces, often making it difficult to pinpoint a certain piece on the sheet provided by the museum.
Nevertheless, some pieces are easily recognizable on the paper and are interesting to note in the collection. Among these exists a painting by silent film star Billie Dove and a small lamp on a shelf described as a sheikh collector’s boudoir lamp.
The exhibition also includes items in glass cases, including scrapbooks by Anger’s grandmother who worked in Hollywood costuming. At first, these scrapbooks feel somewhat out of place because they are not directly linked to Anger’s work, but they are still fascinating to peruse.
On one set of pages, Anger’s grandmother created a section called “Cinema Canines” and “Dog Days in Hollywood,” which were essentially spaces given to photographs of dogs in films. The pages are amusing and add to the sense of nostalgia.
But the biggest factor of nostalgia lies in Anger’s films. A room houses large screens where many of Anger’s short videos are displayed. Anger is known for being one of the first filmmakers to openly depict homosexual relationships.
Describing Anger’s films is far from easy. They are often controversial, difficult to watch and erratic. But something about them keeps the viewer hooked — if not out of interest, then out of sheer confusion. If you were to walk into MOCA on any given day, curious to see what is on display without knowing anything about Anger, the videos and exhibition are definitely difficult to digest. It takes a certain amount of open-mindedness and trust to watch Anger’s films because they are so daring and cinematically complex.
Scorpio Rising is a good example of this. In the film, Anger depicts the biker subculture and creates scenes like the main character getting dressed to set up a somewhat disturbing but equally engrossing scenario. While the Scorpio gets ready to leave the house, we see him putting on rings and at one point snorting cocaine. Scenes of a motorcycle and other scene are interspersed rapidly — if you blink, you literally might miss something.
The action is slow, but the varying angles manage to keep the reader interested and the tension is built up so viewers wonder what will happen next, as the scenes in Scorpio Rising become more and more bizarre.
The video room also has a slightly strange set-up, which does not provide sitting space for more than a few people. Anger’s films need to be digested; forcing some viewers to stand, creating a less-than-optimal viewing experience. If you’re planning on visiting the exhibition, brace yourself — the pieces might not all fit in, but the process of figuring it all out proves the influence Anger has on the film and art world.
When it comes to making films or video art, it takes a certain amount of courage to present viewers with unconventional ideas or setups, and Anger’s willingness to take on this challenge is evident. The exhibition provides a thorough look back at how Anger shook up the film industry with videos that are still perplexing and intriguing today.

With the fall semester drawing to an end, students all have one thing on their minds besides finals: holiday shopping.
But picking out presents isn’t the easiest process. When it comes to video games, blindly entering a GameStop or a Target can be a daunting prospect: How do you know if the game you’re purchasing is really worth the cost? How do you differentiate hype from quality?
The best strategy is first to figure out what kind of gamer you’re shopping for. Whether you’re looking to grab somebody a game or just fine-tuning your own Christmas list, here is a collection of the hottest new titles for all types of gamers looking to make a worthy purchase.
If you’re shopping for the retro-style gamer: 
Nintendo and Sega haven’t had the greatest reputation recently, as evidenced by the current generation’s overwhelming obsession with Microsoft. But these two big-name manufacturers have successfully maintained long-running franchises that are continually improving, and this winter is no exception.
Sega has definitely had its fair share of hit-and-miss titles, but the new Sonic Generations for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC is a step in the right direction. Combining 2-D and 3-D graphics with gameplay elements spanning Sonic’s rich 20-year history, Generations is a throwback that combines flawless high-speed action with childlike nostalgia.
Nintendo’s Super Mario franchise has also experienced its ups and downs. The latest installment to the series, Super Mario 3D Land for the Nintendo 3DS, however, has managed to lure gamers back. It is quickly becoming a holiday-season staple with its simplistic gameplay and innovative graphics, superior to those found in the best-selling Super Mario Galaxy series for the Wii.
Likewise, Mario Kart 7 for the Nintendo 3DS works a familiar formula that is sure to draw big crowds following its release on Dec. 4. Mario-themed racing games practically guarantee top-notch quality and are perfect for those interested in easy-to-master multiplayer action.
If you’re shopping for the gamer looking to get lost in another realm: 
Many of us find comfort in the feeling of being transported to an otherworldly, fantastical reality. In that case, solo action or adventure games — often pricier — are your best bets.
The recently released The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is looking to be one of this winter’s most popular games and will satisfy any gamer’s need for adventure-driven combat. The new installment in the Zelda series utilizes the Wii’s Motion Plus technology for the most realistic swordplay possible.
Skyward Sword is one of the last marquee titles to be released on the Wii before the next-generation Wii U system takes over in 2012, so take this holiday season as an opportunity to cash in on the special collector’s edition.
If Zelda or the Wii just isn’t your thing, the fifth installment in the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim, is a critically acclaimed fantasy-adventure game filled with mesmerizing graphics, dragons, battles and endless plot-fulfillment possibilities through open-world gameplay.
If you’re shopping for the gamer who just wants to shoot things: 
Some of us aren’t always interested in a thought-provoking or lengthy adventure, which is when shooter games take the spotlight.
November’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 capitalizes on online multiplayer interaction and the basic war formula of previous games.
Unfortunately, the third installment is not much different from the second in terms of added elements and level design. Still, the game is a good choice for those just getting into the franchise or those who want a little violent  outlet after a long semester.
Battlefield 3 brings something a little different to the table. Unlike the Call of Duty games, BF3 offers intense vehicular warfare and a variety of expansive urban locations for online combat.
If these first-person shooters aren’t quite what you’re looking for, consider opting for the highly praised third-person adventure shooter Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, released for the Playstation 3.
The latest installment of the popular action-adventure series revisits explorer Nathan Drake and details his newest cinematic quest to find the legendary Atlantis of the Sands. The game takes similar combative elements from previous games but improves upon them with more sophisticated opponents and better online capability.

It can happen at any time — a looming final exam, a boring night at home or too much time watching the Food Network. It’s the attack of the sweet tooth, and the only way to quell its rage is an offering of the sugary kind. Luckily, Los Angeles has many places to score something sweet, from pastries to ice cream to exotic coffee drinks.
Scrumptious sundae · Syrup Desserts is renowned for its gourmet dessert waffle and French crêpe dishes, in addition to a variety of other delectable treats, including its sweet grilled cheese sandwiches and ice cream sundaes. Syrup Desserts also offers sweet and savory drinks. - Mimi Honeycutt | Daily Trojan
Yellow House Cafe

Nearby Koreatown has a slew of fun cafes. The cutest is Yellow House. The cafe appears to be any ordinary, regular home, but step inside for a real treat.
Yellow House specializes in epic lattes featuring flavors like S’mores, French vanilla Oreo, banana and sweet potato. For something a little more filling, Yellow House has a wide selection of homemade cakes, brownies and even a delectable s’mores dish.
For something uniquely Korean and perfect on a summer day, choose the Pat Bing Soo — a dish of shaved ice with sweetened condensed milk topped with ice cream, fruit, optional red bean paste, mocha drops and a smattering of crunchy cereal.

Los Angeles has a frozen yogurt fetish. But sometimes, nothing beats old-fashioned creamy ice cream.
The newer Palms location is definitely worth checking out seeing as it’s owned by Matthew Kang, a USC alumnus and the author of popular food blog Mattatouille.
Scoops is not your grandma’s Baskin Robbins. How about a cone topped wit cheesecake Oreo, chocolate apricot, Guinness tiramisu, pinot noir balsamic fig, or salted caramel?

Syrup Desserts
611 S Spring St.

Sometimes you just want dessert for dinner. That’s where Syrup steps in with its specialized gourmet waffles and crêpes.
Waffle dishes are gleefully decadent, such as the tropical coconut, a coconut waffle with lychee ice cream, sliced pineapples, coconut flakes and pineapple sauce. Syrup also makes delicious crêpes such as the German twist, which comes smothered in lemon curd, dulce de leche ice cream, ricotta cheese, whipped cream and lemon zest.
Those who like a bit of savory with their sweet should check out Syrup’s grilled cheese sandwiches, which combine cheese and fruit,  such as brie and raspberry on a croissant, for a delicious treat.

Ever wondered if the Danish ever eat danishes? They certainly do, but a danish from Denmark is a far cry from its American counterpart. Instead of a hulking slab of cream and jelly-stuffed pastry, the authentic danish is flaky, delicious treat topped with custard or chocolate.
Downtown’s Hygge is the first Danish bakery in Los Angeles, but it stands out as a great cafe in its own right. Other treats include the Sarah Bernhardt, a cookie topped with chocolate mousse and encased in chocolate ganache, and the kringle bar, a delicious puff pastry topped with marzipan, buttercream and sliced almonds.

This national food truck sensation is finally putting down storefront roots in Culver City.
Until then, be on the lookout for the Coolhaus truck.
These dessert alchemists create ice cream sandwiches that make you rethink your favorite flavor profiles. The slabs of ice cream are rich and unique, such as mango sticky rice or brown butter with candied bacon. Pair any ice cream with two homemade cookies, from potato chip and butterscotch to ginger molasses.
This truck has stopped by USC from time to time, so be alert  to some serendipity on Jefferson Boulevard.

For those carless students reading with teary eyes, don’t worry — sugary salvation exists right on campus. Ground Zero, a cafe, music and improv venue and study hotspot, has some of the most decadent milkshakes ever to grace a blender.
You should share. But you won’t. Not with shakes like the Blarney Stone, which combines chai tea and Irish cream, or the Midnight Show, where chocolate, cookies and toffee meld into one heavenly creation. Just try to get to the gym the next day.

What do you get when you take America’s most beloved clan of puppets, add a dash of modern musicality, a sprinkle of 21st century stars and a twist of villainy?
Childhood nostalgia · The Muppets, Jason Segel’s long-awaited cinematic dream, captures the hearts of audience members of all ages. The film reinvents a timeless story and uses mature humor that appeals to children and adults, successfully revitalizing the iconic Muppets. - Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Motion Pictures
The Muppets, which has been marinating in the comedy star and self-professed “Muppets geek” mind of Jason Segel for years.
After co-writing the Dracula puppet musical from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Segel decided it was finally time he made his Muppet dream a reality.
Looking for help, he sent a short and sweet email to British film director James Bobin simply asking, “Do you like the Muppets?”
Nearly two years later, Segel’s dream film has hit theaters, his long-time goal finally achieved.
“I realized there was this 12-year generation gap since anything ‘Muppets’ had been released, so kids age zero to 12 had grown up with no Muppets — that was really sad to me,” Segel said. “The Muppets style of comedy is so pure and so kind, and I think it’s important that kids have that influence in their lives, like I did.”
Segel and Bobin enlisted the help of producers David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman, screenwriter Nicholas Stoller and the whole Muppets gang to create a modern movie-musical extravaganza that stayed true to the feel and tone of Jim Henson’s original creation.
The production team did, however, take a risk by introducing a new Muppet to the gang: Walter, whose story serves as the heart and soul of the film.
“Creating Walter was the greatest challenge we faced,” Lieberman said. “There is a lot of pressure in introducing a new character to such a well-established franchise.”
The production team was careful to maintain the core qualities that define the Muppets with Walter, resulting in an undeniably endearing character with innocence, determination, humility and a heart of gold.
“This is Walter’s story,” Hoberman said. “If the audience is not invested in him, the movie has failed.”
The movie opens by introducing the audience to Walter, the world’s biggest Muppet fan, who lives in Smalltown with his brother Gary (Segel) and Gary’s charming schoolteacher girlfriend Mary, played by the talented Amy Adams.
Walter, Gary and Mary take a vacation to Los Angeles where they discover, much to their chagrin,  Muppet Studios is abandoned and will soon be destroyed by the nefarious oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who plans to drill for oil beneath the Muppets’ former stomping grounds.
What follows is a visit to the home of Kermit the Frog, a trip to Paris to see Miss Piggy and a reunion of the good old Muppet gang, putting on the comeback show of a lifetime to raise the money needed to stop the evil and greedy Tex Richman.
One might expect a fun and childish film unquestionably geared toward a younger crowd, but the film delivers anything but.
The essence of the film is its unique humor. It’s playful and wholesome for young Muppet fans while also retaining witty, clever appeal for mature audiences.
“Jim Henson always used to say that he never wrote ‘down’ to appeal to children,” Bobin said. “He always wrote to what he and his friends thought was funny, which makes it so much more genuine.”
With this sincere, timeless humor as a foundation, the production team was able to take chances with modern musical numbers including Cee Lo Green’s “Forget You” and Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” as well as with celebrity cameos including Selena Gomez, Sarah Silverman and Neil Patrick Harris.
“We didn’t have any trouble finding people who wanted to work with us,” Segel said. “A lot of people actually came to us. There’s something about the Muppets that people are just drawn to. They’re so iconic.”
The tunes are hilarious, heart-wrenching, modern and eternal. Not to mention, the fast-paced and intelligent humor keeps the audience hanging onto every word, especially with the occasional and intentional breaches of the “fourth wall,” or making eye contact and connecting with the audience, something characteristic of the Muppets.
Even with the modern twists, the film’s core holds resolutely true to the Muppet philosophy that has captivated audiences for generations.
“This film is about everything the Muppets stand for — innocence, hope, kindness and the belief that if you work together, you can achieve amazing things,” Bobin said. “Tex Richman represents the modern, wealth-obsessed, narcissistic world, and I hope that people take away from the movie the notion that the pure ideals of the Muppets transcend those things.”
In the words of Kermit the Frog: “The Muppets have always tried to inspire the world with silliness and to show folks that no matter who you are or how weird you seem to others, there’s a place for you and people who care about you. And when you find that place and meet those people, wonderful things happen.”
And with Segel’s dream and passion coupled with the brainpower of many talented individuals, a wonderful thing did happen: The Muppets has been reborn in an everlasting film that will delight audiences of all ages for years to come.

Profiles inaccurate reflection
Social-networking sites have fostered a new type of communication among users, where personal interaction is no longer necessary to know someone’s physical features, feelings and daily activities, circle of friends and location. Facebook, for example, is a site where you can create personal content and broadcast it to a multitude of friends.
What part of that personal content is actually telling of personal ability, motivation, work ethic and academic integrity?
Facebook is no longer just about your friends and family members. Companies, employers and colleges are logging in to see what the “online you” can tell them about the real you. But is there a correlation between the two?
According to The Wall Street Journal, a 2008 survey of 500 top colleges found that 10 percent of admissions officers admitted searching for applicants on social-networking sites to further evaluate their eligibility. This poses questions about how insightful one’s profile is about intellect and potential. Almost 40% of admissions officers making use of the sites admitted that the site negatively affected their views on the applicant, with only 25 percent admitting that their views of the applicant improved.
One college admissions officer explained that some colleges turn to the social websites because “no school wants to give a prestigious scholarship to someone standing on a beer keg and wearing a lampshade.” But what if that beer-keg loving, lampshade aficionado is the next Albert Einstein?
This issue is something unique to our generation. In any other decade, one would not usually get fired or denied a position over a wild weekend of binge drinking because there would be no evidence, and even if there were, that evidence would not be visible to all of your friends. This evidence, along with the information that you work for a certain company, and represent a certain school, is what poses problems for employers and admissions officers today.
More and more I have heard of people being fired or penalized because of their online lives, but this shouldn’t be the case. How much you drink, where you go, and how slutty or conservative you dress on the weekends should have nothing to do with opinions on your academic eligibility or work ethic, as long as the personal is separate from the professional.
The separation of online personal spheres from the workplace and academics is a necessity. Social networking sites should in no way affect the merit of an individual, being that such posts are not genuine reflections of personality types or potential.

The author of this article and those who share her views would also be the first ones to lambast a political figure if it was discovered that the candidate had sexual infidelities or racist comments hiding in his or her “personal” closet. Let’s face it – none of us want to be judged on some information that exists in our past. what I don’t understand are the idiots that keep feeding some compromising images, etc about themselves online and then feel entitled to force the world to ignore it if it got leaked publicly somehow.
Eliot Spitzer made incredible accomplishments as governor of NY. No one can argue that he was a very competent and skilled statesman. His personal life which includes his sex life is not anyone’s business but his own and perhaps his wife’s. Yet he had to step down after it was revealed that he patronized prostitutes. 
The equivalent of what the author of this article is saying should apply to Spitzer as well. However, right or wrong, in the real world we can not separate and compartmentalize actions from the same person – no matter what you feel entitled to. Live with that and be cautious about what you decide to post.
I can’t help but laugh at the third paragraph as well. Obviously there are good points to his/her argument, yet they are all weakened by the fallacious ad hominem ignorantly tacked on at the end. USC provides vast opportunities for students of all majors, and ultimately it is the determination, motivation and networking skills of the individual that determine their success after graduation.
In the real world, there is no magical wall that separates your personal life from your professional life. And in the real world, most people who exercise poor personal judgement also tend to exercise poor professional judgement. There’s nothing wrong with a boss making reaching one conclusion based on another.
Facebook is a public forum, and participation in it is entirely voluntary. Anything you choose to put on there is, in fact, a reflection of you because you posted it (or your friends posted it and you didn’t remove it from your wall). All of that is fair game for anyone you interact with to judge you for. 
But in your case, I wouldn’t worry about it too much. Majoring in gender studies means you’ll probably end up working at Starbucks after graduation. That’s not the kind of job where bosses really care how much you party after your shift ends.
What is the necessity of adding that third paragraph? The writer makes his or her points, yet still feels the need to add a nasty and judgemental personal comment, which serves only to undermine his/her maturity.

Derrik Sweeney, Luke Gates and Gregory Porter, three American students studying abroad in a semester-long program at the American University in Cairo, were arrested by Egyptian authorities for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at police protecting the Interior Ministry during pro-democracy protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.
When news of these students’ arrests in Cairo emerged last week people seemed shocked that Americans would be poorly treated and arrested for their involvement in protests in a foreign country, let alone one under military rule that does not necessarily favor Americans.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
 
Studying abroad should expose students to other cultures and transform them into global citizens, not embroil students in conflict that could result in their detainment, injury or death.
This event should serve as a reminder to the many USC students heading to study abroad programs in the spring.
Students should think twice before putting themselves in potentially dangerous situations — for any reason — in their respective countries of study.
One of the students said the three wanted to “see democracy in action,” so they made their way toward the violence in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.
When some plain-clothed policemen saw the conspicuously American trio making their way toward the packed and chaotic protests, they pounced on the opportunity to accuse them of conspiracy against the government.
The careless disregard these students exhibited is what others need to avoid when they are guests on foreign soil, particularly in areas with instability such as Egypt.
With the efforts of diplomats and cooperation between American and Egyptian authorities, the students were fortunate to be released on Thursday and sent home.
Though it is understandable students would be curious about historic events like the Egyptian revolution and would want to be able to say they were a part of it, they must consider the consequences of being in a position where they could be associated with anti-government activities.
As students head out of the country and call foreign places their homes for a semester, they should keep in mind why they are taking advantage of such an opportunity.
This way, they can be on their best behavior and not mess up what should be one of the greatest experiences of their lives.

I find it hilarious when student from the US go to a foreign land and behave as if their mommy and daddy can shield them from harm like they can when they are on home turf. It makes me laugh because these kids behave like they can rampage with abandon and not face any consequences like they can in the US. I hope if anything, this gives people more of an appreciation for living in America. Here, you can act the fool and if you get tazed after multiple warnings to disperse, you can cry to Gloria Allred and whine like a little baby. In many other foreign countries – they will treat you like the sniveling little brat that you are and cane your behind. We actually should import more of that discipline to the US.

There is a saying in show business that goes something like, “Dying is easy, but comedy is hard.” Though the best comedians make comedy look perfectly simple, if not easy, it is quite difficult to make a movie funny.
The number of unfunny movies that have been released over the years are a testament to this.

USC is striving to change the state of comedy by creating the Comedy@SCA program.
This program, the first of its kind, will offer a concentration on the technical side of creating comedy films.
Like it did 82 years ago when it founded the first dedicated film school in the country, the USC School of Cinematic Arts is pioneering the instruction of something new that might not have been previously thought of as something that could, or should, be taught in a university setting.
The comedy program is a necessary risk because it has the potential to keep SCA at the forefront of film schools across America due to its innovative nature. Its originality and ability to serve a niche makes it a worthy addition to an already expansive film school.
The program definitely poses a risk, attempting something that has never been done before always does — but SCA knows it takes a certain amount of risk to keep the school at the top of its game.
If Comedy@SCA succeeds, it will forever be known as the first school to do so, giving SCA even more credibility.
Comedy has been integral to the world of cinema from the beginning. Charlie Chaplin’s silent comedies of the ’20s filled the theaters with as much laughter as does The Hangover and Bridesmaids today. Yet, despite its difficulty, popularity and long history, comedy has never been taken seriously by the film community.
Rarely does a comedic movie make it into the Academy Awards, Hollywood’s marquee event, and there are few universities in the country that have offered programs purely dedicated to the making of comedic films.
Widely recognized as the top film school in the country, SCA could have very easily stayed where it was and continued doing things to fulfill the status quo and nothing more.
But this isn’t the first time the university has taken a risk when it comes to the film school.
When the SCA was founded in 1929, the film industry was already huge, generating millions of dollars.
It still must have struck some people as very odd, however, that a major university was actually teaching something as artistic as film in a classroom setting.
The school set an amazing precedent; there are now hundreds of film schools around the world.
SCA’s founders understood film was a complicated field that could benefit from instruction.
With its foray into comedy, USC is attempting a similarly trailblazing move.
Some might question what the university is doing in pursuing such a peculiar program, that something that is usually so serious as a university education could be reconciled with studying something as irreverent as comedy.
Those leading the charge see what critics fail to. The comedy sector of the movie business and its difficulties need instruction and emphasis. Comedy@SCA does just that.
Instead, it chose to continue pushing the envelope with a program as creative as Comedy@SCA.
Being seen as the top school in its category, the school could have very easily stayed where it was and continued doing things to fulfill the status quo and nothing more.
Instead, SCA chose to continue pushing the envelope with a program as creative as Comedy@SCA, and that’s exactly what will keep the school at the forefront of its field.

After a season-opening win at home against Cal State Northridge, the USC men’s basketball team had dropped two straight contests by a combined margin of five points.
It was, and still is, searching for an identity and looking for a true No. 1 offensive scoring threat. But against South Carolina in the Las Vegas Invitational third place game, sophomore point guard Maurice Jones answered the call.
USC (3-4) escaped with a 63-60 victory against the Gamecocks behind 28 points from Jones. Despite coming into the contest shooting just 41 percent from the field, Jones converted on 9-of-15 field goals, including 7-of-7 from behind the 3-point line, which set a USC single-game record for the most 3-pointers made without a miss. At one point, he scored 14 consecutive points for the Trojans, turning a one-point deficit into a five-point lead with six minutes to play in the game.
Redshirt sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon registered 15 points, eight rebounds and three blocks, while junior forward Aaron Fuller recorded six points and a game-high 10 rebounds.
The Trojans played, arguably, its toughest opponent this season Friday against UNLV, as the Rebels entered the contest averaging 83 points per contest. USC held UNLV to just 66 points on 41 percent shooting — both season lows — but it was not enough as the Trojans dropped the game 66-55. USC shot 52 percent from the field, but Dedmon and Fuller both fouled out, with Dedmon playing just five minutes. The 7-foot center also picked up his first technical foul of his collegiate career midway through the second half with the Trojans leading by two. After that, however, the Rebels went on an 8-0 run and never relinquished the lead en route to victory.
Freshman guard Byron Wesley recorded a career-high 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting and also grabbed five rebounds. Fuller, despite playing just 17 minutes, also scored 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting.
USC topped a winless Morgan State team 65-62, receiving a career-high 19-point effort from Fuller on Nov. 22, the second game of the tournament. The Trojans trailed by eight at halftime, and by as much as 12 points six minutes into the contest. On consecutive 3-point baskets by junior guard Gregg Allen five minutes into the second half, USC took the lead at 40-38.
The Trojans would lead by as many as nine points midway through the second half, but the Bears battled back, even taking the lead momentarily at 61-60 with four minutes left to play. With 1:57 remaining in a 62-62 contest, Jones split a pair of free throws. On the next possession, Jones added a runner in the lane to give the Trojans to a three-point lead. Fuller later sealed the victory to help USC snap a three-game skid. Jones finished with 18 points and six assists while Allen came off the bench to score 14 points, including 3-of-5 from the 3-point line.
USC returns to the court Wednesday night at UC Riverside for a 7 p.m. matchup.

Downtown Los Angeles debuted a bright new way to streamline bicycle traffic last week on one of the area’s biggest streets, unveiling a lime-green bike lane. The lane stretches from Cesar Chavez Avenue to 9th Street, and is the first full-color lane in the city. Council members hope the new bike lane will bring heightened safety and visibility to downtown traffic.
The six-foot lane allows a four-foot buffer zone and an eight-foot parking lane on the west side of the street, providing ample room for both two- and four-wheeled traffic. Buses are allowed to cross over the bike lane and the buffer zone, but cannot drive for long stretches in the area.
Regular bike lanes cost anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 per mile, and the green paint on the 1.6-mile downtown stretch is estimated to add around $50,000. However, this investment is part of the city’s master plan, which encompasses a 1,680-mile bicycle lane network and 200 miles of updates every five years.
“We’re looking for—at the same time we expand our transit network — how do we also expand our active transportation network to link up with that?” said Alexis Lantz of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition in the Los Angeles Times. “It’s about providing more options for people across the city.”
A similar lane was also opened on Boyle Heights’ First Street, stretching 1.6 miles from Lorena Street to Boyle Avenue. However, this lane only has solid-green paint in conflict areas, such as alleys, driveways, and turn lanes. In addition, it is made using green thermoplastic instead of paint.
Other bike lanes are set to open soon as well. More information can be found here.

Its 13-game winning streak might be snapped, but the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team is still the No. 1 seed in December’s NCAA tournament.
The Trojans (22-3, 8-0) were narrowly defeated this weekend in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament by No. 3 UCLA in the finals, losing an automatic bid to the NCAA championship.
Regardless, the Trojans will join UCLA (23-4, 6-2) at the NCAAs, where the Bruins earned a slot as the No. 2 seed. UC San Diego was named the No. 3 seed, and Princeton the No. 4.
“The game against UCLA was meaningless for us,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “We knew that we were going to be ranked No. 1 in the conference. UCLA was fighting for its life because if it hadn’t won the game they probably wouldn’t have gone to NCAAs.”
The MPSF tournament started off on a high note for the Trojans as they defeated No. 8 Pacific for the second time this season, 11-7, in their first game. USC struggled in the first period, however, trailing 6-5 as the half rolled around. The Trojans came back from the break scoring six unanswered goals, and shutting out the Tigers in the third period.
Following their win against Pacific, the Trojans faced No. 4 Stanford in the semifinal game of the MPSF tournament. The Cardinal did not give way easily to the USC team, starting off the game with a 4-0 lead, and then kept the score to their advantage at 6-4 entering the fourth quarter.
It was there that the Trojan offense fought back and the efforts of senior goalie Joel Dennerley kept all Stanford shots out of the net. Two goals from sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie, who also earned a hat trick in the game, and one apiece from freshman driver Kostas Genidounias and sophomore driver Nikola Vavic in the second half secured USC a trip to the final round of the tournament.
“Those three boys, two sophomores and a freshman, really stepped up,” Jovan Vavic said.
Nikola Vavic scored seven goals in total for the Trojans in the tournament, and Davie scored five.
Both games, against Pacific and Stanford, saw a valiant effort from USC in the second half, but cause for concern in the opening period.
“In the beginning of the game we rotate more players so we don’t necessarily play our best players — we play more players,” Vavic said. “When you do that you water down your offensive power because you are splitting into two teams. In the fourth quarter we end up wearing the other team down.”
In the MPSF championship game, however, the Trojans could not wear down the Bruins and lost in sudden death, 10-9. Vavic still expressed his happiness in what the team got out of the tournament.
“The most important part of the tournament was to find out which players we could count on, which were ready to play and which players were not,” Vavic said. “We learned we can certainly count on all of our players. They are all ready.”
USC overcame an early 5-1 scoring deficit in the UCLA game, tying the contest 5-5 in the third quarter. The Trojans then came out of a 7-5 hole in the fourth period, forcing overtime with the score tied at 7-7.
With two shots from UCLA matched by goals from Davie and senior driver Peter Kurzeka, the game went into sudden death. Redshirt junior driver Michael Rosenthal set up USC for the first possession but an offensive foul gave UCLA the ball instead, and Cristiano Mirarchi would deliver the winning goal for the Bruins.
The loss, USC’s first since defeat at the hands of Stanford and UCLA at the SoCal tournament in October, marked the end of a winning streak but not the end of the road. The NCAA tournament is set to take place Dec. 3-4 in Berkeley, Calif.
“We are very excited,” Vavic said. “This has been a great year. We have had great chemistry, our guys are really excited and we have good leadership.”
 
Jovan Vavic and the great coaches & players fought bravely in all 3 matches that I witnessed poolside over the Thanksgiving weekend.  I am confident we will reach the finals by soundly defeating Princeton.
The rematch with the bruins will be our 3rd meeting in 16 days.  We dominated the Friday Nov. 18th match at ucla….never trailed, winning 9-6.
Our guys are ready for the challenge. I am confident the finals Sunday Dec 4th will be a great match.
These players know each other well. There is no way usc will get behind 5-1, or anything close.
We have the best players and best coaches…..I say Trojans win the final by a score of 8-6.
What say you?  Fight on water polo champs and  bring home your 4th consecutive National Championship.

Cho, born YongMin Cho in South Korea, grew up in Los Angeles. After graduating from the Harvard-Westlake School in 2009, he attended Indiana University at Bloomington, where he served as Lambda Chi’s recruitment chairman and founded a Greek peer support program.
After transferring to USC last spring, Cho became involved with Greek Chat, USC’s confidential discussion group for Greek community members who identify as LGBT, questioning or curious.
LGBT Center Director Vincent Vigil said Cho sought out the LGBT Center when he arrived on campus and was very passionate about bridging the gap between the LGBT and Greek communities.
“He participated in every single [Greek Chat] that we sponsored,” Vigil said. “He served as an ally to a lot of students who were questioning or closeted on The Row and made sure there was a place they could come to …  and that they were not alone.”
Vigil said Cho was actively working with Greek Chat program leaders up until his death, as they met two weeks ago.
“We were just sitting down, talking about what we could do to educate more people and get more people on board,” Vigil said. “He had a lot of great ideas. We’re still going to use them for the next year.”
Katharine Hanson, a junior majoring in architecture, said she was Cho’s best friend at USC. The two juniors became close after meeting through a mutual friend last spring. Hanson said they ate lunch together almost every day, are each other’s dates for all of their fraternity and sorority events and ran errands for each other.
Hanson said her fondest memories of Cho were the everyday ones — eating Nutella and waffles, watching the Real Housewives TV shows, going to “all the great places to eat” in Los Angeles and shopping at the supermarket.
“He wasn’t feeling well one day so he called me and asked me to make him feel better,” Hanson said. “So, I went and got him a happy face balloon and a cheesecake, dressed up in a nurse’s costume and knocked on his door and said, ‘Feel better!’ We just did ridiculous things together.”
Hanson said she couldn’t walk down Trousdale Parkway with Cho without being stopped multiple times because so many people would stop them to say hello.
“He literally would do anything for anyone,” Hanson said. “I wouldn’t even know that I was upset or needed to talk but he would know and sit me down and say, ‘What’s up? Do you need to talk about it?’”
The two used to joke about how, after getting married and starting families, their kids would become friends.
“It’s still unreal to me. I received this phone call [from the hospital] out of the blue,” Hanson said. “I expected us to get married to someone, have kids and have our kids play together. Now that’s not going to happen.”
Lambda Chi President Travis Robinson said Cho cared deeply for others and spent a lot of time cheering up those around him.
“There was no one else in our [fraternity] like him,” Robinson said. “He was the guy that always had a smile on his face and was optimistic and outgoing. He was always … looking out for everyone.”
Hanson said Cho’s legacy won’t be forgotten.
“He had so much potential — really that’s what the biggest heartache is,” Hanson said. “He was so brilliant and had so much to offer the world. It’s a shame he didn’t have the chance to share it with everyone.”
An open-casket memorial service will be held at the United University Church at USC on Wednesday. Doors will open at 3:15 p.m. and the service will begin at 4 p.m.
Lambda Chi plans to set up a fund for a charity in Cho’s name in coordination with the LGBT Center. Those interested in donating can contact Robinson or other members of the Lambda Chi fraternity for more information.
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Cho passed away at the age of 21. He was 22.
My love goes out to the family, the brothers of Lambda Chi and all the USC community.  I will miss you dearly Dennis. You will shine on in all I do with Lambda10 & Greeks on LGBT issues… Love you!
By Tuesday, “Friend” means Nov 22, not Nov 15.  Could you please correct that as well?  Thank you.
Aside from the slight errors, I appreciated this article.  I miss you, Dennis… more than I ever would have admitted to your face.  I wish everyone had the opportunity to know you like I did.  You were an amazing man.  You are an amazing soul.  Rest in peace.  You deserve it.
I only met Dennis once, and we ended up chatting for over an hour. He was just incredibly friendly and full of life. He was once of the nicest people that I’ve ever met at USC and definitely the nicest person that I ever knew in the Greek community.
Just for the record, Dennis was 22 and died Tuesday.
what a tragedy. Wish I would have known Mr. Cho.  His legacy will live on in our memories.
God Bless You Dennis, and may your soul Rest In Peace.
Congrats on being a USC TROJAN & for being brave & letting others know about LBGT.  I am a straight man, but respect all others rights. Sexual Orientation still has many students and others uptight. We must all break down these Prejudices & Hate Mentalities.  FIGHT ON, DANIEL CHO, a Trojan who will LIve in our Hearts 4ever.

Every day for nearly a month, Javed Shaikh, now a graduate student in biomedical engineering, waited in line at his local branch of the Punjab National Bank in India. While others queued to cash paychecks or buy home insurance, Shaikh returned to the bank each day in hopes of obtaining a student loan.
Shaikh had finished his undergraduate degree in India and gained admission to USC in spring 2010, but a barrier stood between him and his education: the onerous process of applying for a commercial bank loan.
“There was a financing problem,” Shaikh said. “Getting a loan, you have to spend days and stay there for the banks and go through the formalities, [like] lots of policies and long documents.”
Released this month, the annual “Open Doors” report from the Institute of International Education once again named USC the leading university in international student enrollment, but getting to USC isn’t always an easy task for international students, as USC meets 0 percent of international financial need.
In the 2010-11 academic year, 63 percent of international students studying in the United States were self- or family-funded, according to Open Doors data. Though 23 percent received full or nearly full support from U.S. universities in the form of doctoral studentships or other merit-based scholarships, foreign funding sources outweighed domestic ones almost three to one.
When a prospective domestic student visits the USC Financial Aid website, he or she is directed to a bevy of resources including scholarships, loans, need-based grants and federal work-study. International students find their options much more restricted: Merit scholarships, limited work and private financing comprise the smorgasbord.
For Shaikh, relying on the local bank for a loan, which falls under the category of private financing, was the only option, and this meant delaying the start of his graduate education.
The days at the bank turned into a month. Many days, his father came in and waited with him, and together they met with managers who would point out missing requirements on a lengthy checklist of legal forms. Finally, Shaikh had to defer his admission by a semester because a property mortgage paper needed for collateral would not go through.
Shaikh said he did not approach USC’s Office of Admissions, Financial Aid Office, Office of International Services or Office of Globalization as he tried to navigate his funding obstacle course. But even if he had, he likely would not have found much help.
Part of the reason the school provides limited information on finances for international students is that international students must show proof of financial support before admission, according to Tom McWhorter, dean of financial aid at USC.
A federal law stipulates international applicants must submit a bank or sponsor letter showing they have sufficient funds to cover tuition and living expenses for the first nine months of study. Students studying under the J-1 or F-1 temporary non-immigrant student visa do not qualify for any need-based financial aid at USC.
Anthony Bailey, associate provost of global initiatives, said the USC Office of Global Initiatives supports recruiting initiatives abroad but the focus is mostly on admissions questions, not financial questions. Students who need financial help are directed to the Office of Admission and then rerouted to the Financial Aid Office.
Patrick Moore, assistant dean of loans at the Financial Aid Office, summarized the university’s response to loan questions from international applicants: “We tell them to call banks.”
McWhorter also said the only role the Financial Aid Office plays in the international student loan process is to certify valid student loans from domestic lenders.
Nirat Patel, a graduate student studying green technologies, said that, for international students, U.S. financial aid is “a complicated process for someone who doesn’t have a relationship [with the United States].”
Patel has loans from the State Bank of India. As in Shaikh’s case, Patel’s parents were heavily involved in helping him secure the loan.
“The first thing the bank looks at is, is the parent capable of taking care of the loan?” Patel said. “Then they look at the prospects of the degree, your grades, and so forth.”
Patel does not need to repay his loan until he finds a job. But if a year or two after graduation he is still unemployed, according to a timetable set by the bank, the parent who serves as guarantor will have to pay back the loan.
The situation can be different for students from other countries. Haowang Wong, a graduate student in electrical engineering and president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, said foreign students might appear to lack financial need because [United States] higher education has an “only the rich need apply” image.
Though study abroad loans exist in China, Wong said students hesitate to use them.
“Most Chinese people wouldn’t borrow money from other people,” Wong said. “If they can afford it, they’ll come to the U.S., but if not, then they won’t.”
Wong also noted that cultural inclinations can sometimes get in the way.
“Chinese students won’t [tell] you if they don’t have money because it’s a sensitive topic,” Wong said.
For some international students, cultural taboos against borrowing because of the sheer difficulty of obtaining a loan mean their attendance at USC depends on scholarship availability.
Ting Lye, a junior studying business administration and neuroscience, is a Malaysian citizen who applied from the United Kingdom.
“I couldn’t borrow money from England,” Lye said. “For Malaysia, it was pretty hard because I didn’t do any of my schooling there.”
Lye ultimately selected USC because it offered merit-based scholarships, unlike Ivy League universities.
Rebecca Petersen, an adviser in the Office of International Services, said cases like Lye’s and Shaikh’s are common.
“It’s not a matter of their attitudes toward loans, but their access to them,” she said.

USC has received a $50 million donation from the Price Family Charitable Fund to endow the USC School of Policy, Planning and Development, which will be renamed the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, the school announced Monday.
Growing · The USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, located in Ralph and Goldy Lewis Hall, plans to expand its social justice goals with the $50 million donation from the Price Family Charitable Fund. - Alice Lee | Daily Trojan
The new endowment will provide USC Sol Price School with the resources to expand its social justice goals through the creation of the USC Sol Price Center for Social Innovation and plan to make the USC Sol Price School the leading public policy school in the nation.
“This gift allows us to achieve excellence in innovation and become the best school of public policy in the country,” USC Sol Price School Dean Jack Knott said. “It will also allow us to increase our social justice and urban development programs in partnership with the Price Family Charitable Fund.”
Robert Price, chairman of the Price Family Charitable Fund said they decided to donate because the school’s values were similar to those of his father.
“The school’s approach to public policy and administration, urban planning, real estate development and health care is closely aligned with the core principles my father held dear,” Robart Price said in a press release. “Endowing the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy not only honors my father’s legacy but also advances sound research and scholarship and develops future leaders who will serve at the forefront of social change.”
The Center for Social Innovation, which will open spring 2012, will provide students the opportunity to apply their knowledge in the classroom to practical situations. The center will initially focus on issues affecting low-income areas in San Diego, where the Price Family Charitable Fund is located.
“The Center for Social Innovation will work to provide access to health care, employment opportunities and education for people in low-income areas,” Knott said. “Our partnership with Price Family Charitable Fund will allow us to carry out projects eventually in Los Angeles in low-income areas near USC.”
The school will be named after Sol Price, the founder of the Price Family Charitable Fund and the discount department stores Price Club and FedMart, which merged with Costco in the 1980s. SOL Price graduated from the USC School of Law in 1938.
Last May, Price’s grandson, David Price, graduated from the school. After attending his graduation ceremony, the Price family decided to contribute to the school because of the its focus on social justice, which is at the core of the Price Family Charitable Fund’s mission.
“Undergraduate students will have real life experience to develop transportation and health care policy for a real client and receive feedback from clients,” Knott said.
According to Knott the endowment will allow the school to focus on social justice issues on both a local and national level.
“By attracting the best faculty we hope to start national dialogue on social justice,” Knott said. “We want to influence state and national policies and create models of urban development that might be applied in other cities across the country.”
Also the USC Sol Price School will use the endowment to hire new faculty, provide scholarships and internship opportunities for students and increase resources for the student body.
Did Price got to USC or SDSU for undergrad?  Nikias said in his email that he went to USC undergrad, but every other publication lists him as only attending USC for Law School.
Did Sol Price attend USC or SDSU for undergrad?  Nikias said he went to USC in his email but every other source including the Daily Trojan said he only went to Law School.
Great article. Sol Price was an innovator and great mind, as well as a super philanthropist.
