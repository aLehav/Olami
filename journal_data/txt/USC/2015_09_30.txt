The University hosted a press tour of the USC Village on Wednesday afternoon led by William Marsh, director of construction.
The USC Village is currently in phase one of construction, which is on schedule to be completed in Fall 2017. At the end of the first phase, six buildings will be completed, and the University will then have the option of whether or not it wants to embark on phase two, which would lead to the construction of three additional buildings.
Before embarking on the tour, Marsh explained some of the unique challenges presented by such a massive undertaking. One of these challenges involved Building Nine — the largest building in the Village and the one that will host the vendors — and how having to drill space underground could have potentially been a catastrophe.
“One of the challenges was that the shoring was so close to Hoover, and if you know about Hoover, there’s a 61-inch water main that feeds basically all of Los Angeles and runs all the way down the Long Beach, and we’re digging down and driving shoring and tie-backs underneath. So I was saying, ‘Please make sure we don’t puncture the 60-inch water main, or we’re going to shut down Los Angeles.’”
Marsh said that one of the mistakes UCLA had made in its recent renovations was something that they took note of as well during the building process.
“The water breakage over [at]UCLA happened about a month and a half before we started that excavation,” Marsh said. “So I was like, ‘USC doesn’t want to be on the news for taking out water mains.’”

Despite the unique challenges that the Village project has presented, Marsh said that strong management and injury prevention protocol has allowed the Village to move ahead of schedule.
“Obviously we’ve been having this heat the last two months, so making sure water is available, making sure people are taking breaks, really paying a lot of attention to the crews [is critical]. And the testament is really what you’re seeing,” he said. “We’ve actually gained 17 days on Building Six and all of that is good management, keeping people healthy and having a good executed plan.”
Even though most of the old University Village was torn down during construction, some of it is actually being reused by the University. Marsh went into detail about how the old fire station is being reused by the School of Cinematic Arts.
“We’re actually removing the first third of the fire station,” he said. “There’s actually wheels on it right now, and in a few weekends, in the middle of the night we’re going to wheel it over to its new home.”
The buildings that are currently the furthest along in construction are Building Four, a residential area for students; Building Six, the fitness center and Building Nine; the main building. When showing the press Building Four, the building that is the furthest along, Marsh went in greater detail about the plans USC Hospitality had to keep the Village occupied and vibrant throughout the calendar year.

“USC Hospitality wants to keep [the Village] 80 percent full even in the off-seasons and the summers because people are making transitions and it will be reduce rated to try to keep people active in the Village all year round,” Marsh said.
Marsh finished the tour by showing the press a mock up of one of the dorms, saying that the Village dorms especially were holding true with University President C. L. Max Nikias’ initial vision for the village.
“Max’s vision was for this to be a village in Italy. So all of the color schemes are based off of it being in a village in Italy.”
Miles Woods, a sophomore majoring in creative writing, noted that it seemed like the University was making major progress.
“I moved here onto campus like a year ago and the Village seemed pretty nonexistent when I moved in. Like, it was a big open space, but now there’s actual development. So it’s coming along pretty well, they’ve done a decent amount of work over the summer, and I didn’t know about it until now.”

Christian Carrion, assistant director of Diversity Affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government, asked students in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom to grade the diversity and inclusion at USC. Students raised their hands to signal which letter grade they would give the school. Most students raised their hands for a “C” or a “D.” Only one raised her hand for an “A.”
Students gathered Wednesday night for an open forum on racism, sexism and diversity in the USC community at the first Voices of USC event, “Diversity Climate On Our Campus” hosted by USG.
The exercise set the tone for the rest of the event — intense, emotionally charged and mostly frustrated. Students and faculty shared stories of switching housing to avoid homophobic slurs, being stopped at night as they crossed campus and wincing at a professor’s microaggressions in class.
“Everyone is ready to boil over,” said Boka Agboje, a junior majoring in interactive media. “A lot of people when they were talking had a lot of channelled and controlled rage that they were trying to temper down. That lid might come off if issues are not addressed.”
USG Director of External Relations Katherine Wilcox, Director of Diversity Affairs Moira Turner and Carrion served as a moderating panel that allowed students to share their own stories and voice personal concerns. This format was designed to connect administrators and students directly in an effort to create a safer campus environment.
“USG is supposed to work as a liaison between the administration and students, but sometimes that makes it really easy to create a disconnect between the two,” Wilcox said. “We’re hoping that forums like this will let the administration hear how students are feeling directly and let them react and respond to that.”
Wilcox and the panel encouraged students to provide solutions whenever they shared a story. This led to a variety of suggestions, most of which involved creating proactive resources for minorities and suppressed groups. The moderating panel pointed out that current resources on campus — such as hotlines, resource centers and online bias incident reporting systems — can only be used after an incident occurred.
“We’re talking about diversity in this room, but we should really be talking about justice,” said Brianna Thorpe, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development. “How do we teach students to care about justice?”
There were many answers to this question. Some students suggested censoring speech when it verges on harassment; others asked for diversity training for student leaders at the start of each year. The most common suggestion was a broad system of education for students and faculty alike. Students called for a system of education similar to the AlcoholEdu and Talk About It modules required for new students every year. This idea was repeated throughout the forum and was openly received by faculty.
“I get a whole bunch of complaints about those trainings that [students] have to click through, but at the same time I hear that more and more students want a module or a training involving racism,” Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said. “I’d love to continue this conversation, but it has to address every side — it has to be the education side, prevention side and the policy side.”
Another concern, ironically, was the lack of diversity among students in attendance. Despite the turnout at the event, multiple students noted that the majority of the students in the room were minorities or women. This created a concern that multiple students voiced — that the conversation wasn’t reaching those who need to hear it the most.
“We’re talking amongst ourselves so we never get any change,” said Krystal Chavez, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development. “No one’s listening. We can talk as much as we want and talk about what we’re passionate about. But who’s accountable? Where’s the change?”
Wednesday’s event came on the heels of an incident at USC involving USG President Rini Sampath, who shared a story on Facebook of a student who allegedly screamed a racial slur and threw a drink at her through the window of his fraternity house.
According to Wilcox, a discussion on racism and diversity had been on the agenda for later this year. But after Sampath’s post garnered thousands of Facebook likes and national media coverage, USG agreed that the topic was too pressing to wait to discuss. Sampath, however, stressed that this issue extends far beyond her isolated incident.
“This story really isn’t about me,” Sampath said. “These are the same stories that students have been telling for years. I know it’s frustrating to wonder why my story is getting so much attention. I just want [students] to know, it’s been your turn, it’s always been your turn, so share your stories.”
Sampath was the final student to speak, and she echoed the sentiments that had been repeated throughout the first 90 minutes of the forum — students might not have all the answers, but they can agree that change is needed to make a safe, comfortable environment on campus.
“All of you [administrators] have so much power, and the students trust you so much,” Sampath said. “We have been carrying this torch for so long, and it’s time to come together as administrators and students alike to work on a solution.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated the event took place Tuesday night. It took place Wednesday night. It also stated that Christian Carrion asked students to grade diversity at USC. He asked students to grade diversity and inclusion.The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.
All you anti-Whites make excuse after excuse to turn every White country into a non-White country – Genocide.
All you anti-Whites rationalize and justify White children living as minorities in their own homes – Genocide.
All you anti-Whites justify a future without White children. – Genocide.
When you are exposed for the genocide you support, you call us names, send us death threats, and get us fired from our jobs.
Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

The Class of 2019 is one of the “most diverse and academically talented in the university’s 135-year history,” according to the University, who released statistics on the incoming class of freshmen Wednesday morning.
The acceptance rate for this year was 17.7 percent, making it the most selective in the University’s history. The admission rate  decreased by 5.3 percent from 2011. The class had an average unweighted GPA of 3.73, with 564 students coming in with a perfect GPA.
“To me, this class represents the direction that the University is heading,” Director of Admissions Kirk Brennan said. “We’re becoming more selective because more people are becoming aware of the great things that are happening here.”
Freshmen who are the first in their families to attend college make up 14 percent of the 2,949 freshmen enrolled.
“A global research university needs to provide educational access and opportunity to all.  The diversity of our incoming class illustrates our ongoing commitment to finding the next generation of leaders from all walks of life,” Provost Michael Quick, a first-generation college student himself, said in a press release.
As defined by Pell grant eligibility, 17 percent of admitted students come from low-income families, and more than two-thirds of the class will receive financial aid assistance.
The Class of 2019 includes the inaugural class of the Kaufman School of Dance, which is made of 15 men and 18 women. More than half of them are first-generation or underrepresented minority students. The application to the school included a dance sample and an in-person audition.
“There is a very small number of students around the country that want to study dance at that level of intensity. The schools that are already doing this have long established and have strong history in this area,” Brennan said. “For a brand new school to bring the kind of talent that they did here is a real [testament] to the strength of USC and how the gifts that Kaufman brought to our community have also brought a level of excellence to this campus that will make an immediate impact.”
Additionally, the class ranks among the most ethnically diverse, with 22 percent underrepresented minority students, including 7 percent black, 13 percent Latino and 2 percent Native American/Pacific Islander.
Brennan said the class  of 2019 is special because of its passion.
“The thing that strikes me is the desire to make an impact that we see in the successful applications,” Brennan said. “As we read applications, the ones that rise to the top of the very competitive process are students who are ambitious.”
The states that were most highly represented in the incoming class were California, Texas, New York and Illinois. The countries that contributed the most students other than the United States included China, India, Canada, South Korea and Taiwan.
“Occasionally, [I] find myself in another country, and the recognition of the USC name is very strong,” Brennan said. “The same kind of spirit that we feel on campus is everywhere. The worldwide presence is there. This is happening not just because students are coming, but because there is a whole university effort in connecting students with research and partnerships to universities around the world.”

Panelists discussed the geopolitical impact of and potential next steps to the Iran nuclear deal at the bi-weekly Students Talk Back hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Wednesday in the Rosen Room of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The panel featured former State Assemblywoman Cindy Montañez, former State Assemblyman Anthony Portantino, Political Director of the USC College Democrats Samantha Archie and Vice President of the USC College Republicans Leesa Danzek.
The discussion was co-moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Darian Nourian, sports editor of the Daily Trojan.
The panel opened with a discussion of the benefits of the Iran nuclear agreement.
“Nuclear scientists and nonproliferation experts in large part support the deal,” Archie said. “We also have the support of the global community, including Russia and China.”
Archie also cited the far-reaching nature of the agreement, the lack of a viable alternative and the stringent safeguards set up by the deal as reasons to support the agreement. Though Danzek agreed with Archie on the importance of nonproliferation, she raised concerns about the deal’s possible consequences for the Middle East.
“Iran is an enemy of many countries in the region, whether it’s Jordan, Israel, Saudi Arabia [or] Egypt,” Danzek said. “Countries like this have now said that they’re concerned about their own safety, so the ramifications of the deal in terms of nonproliferation would essentially lead to an arms race.”
Montañez echoed Danzek’s apprehension and expressed doubts about the agreement’s effectiveness in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. She listed several provisions that are missing from the agreement that she and other critics see as crucial to dismantling Iran’s nuclear program.
“What the deal does is that it leaves Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in place. It defers for 10 to 15 years, but does not stop them from ever being able to acquire nuclear weapons,” Montanez said. “There is no process … to have what they call ‘anywhere, anytime’ inspections. That means that anytime, anywhere, international inspectors could go in and inspect places where there could be potential nuclear activity.”
Portantino agreed that there are flaws in the nuclear deal but said there were no credible alternatives to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
“I was reading some of the statements of the Congress members who voted, even those who supported the deal expressed reservations and said, ‘I wish it had done this,’ but nobody was bringing forward this,” Portantino said. “They had to choose the common interest, which was 15 years of snapback sanctions, 15 years of inspections, 15 years of delay to try to put in place a better alternative.”
Danzek returned to discussing the potential geopolitical effects of the Iran nuclear agreement. She suggested that Russia and China have ulterior motives in supporting the deal, as China has already pledged billions of dollars to purchase surplus Iranian oil and Russia could potentially purchase intercontinental missiles and uranium supply from Iran.
The panel then transitioned to a discussion of steps to take now that the nuclear agreement has been enacted.
“Number one, we have to look at our allies in the region. How do we enhance and protect the qualitative military edge for Israel, to ensure that Israel, who is our strongest ally and the only democracy in the region, is strongly protected,” Montañez said. “Number two … we have to be able to work with Congress in a bipartisan manner to re-authorize the snapback sanctions that are set to expire next year.”
Montañez warned about the inevitability of Iran violating the terms of the agreement and highlighted the importance of enforcing severe international penalties for those transgressions.
“It’s going to be critical, for the country, for us as the United States and our allies around the world, to remain vigilant and mitigate the negative externalities that come from the deal that was passed,” Montañez said.
Portantino echoed earlier sentiments about the need to protect Israel. He stressed that though the nuclear deal is imperfect, it is important to maintain hope in preventing discord and terrorism in the Middle East.
“We can be cynical about the past, but we have to focus on being optimistic about the future,” Portantino said. “What’s presented in this agreement is the challenge to make it work, and the challenge to make sure that Israel’s safe, and the challenge to make sure that America’s intelligence is second to none, to make sure that Iran doesn’t acquire nuclear weapons.”

Campus crime in 2014 declined slightly from previous years according to the Annual Security and Fire Safety report released Wednesday by the Department of Public Safety,  which contained crime data from both USC campuses for the past three years.
According to the report, there were 31 sex offenses reported on or around the University Park Campus in 2014 including 18 cases of rape and 13 cases of nonconsensual fondling, down from 33 cases reported in 2013. Crimes reported under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, including stalking and domestic violence, fell from 26 reports in 2013 to 17 last year.
Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that since the University has implemented policies to make sexual assault reporting easier for students, he expected the number of reported assaults to increase before decreasing.
“We want people to feel comfortable coming forward to report,” Carry said. “I hope that number reflects more people coming forward to report and fewer incidents of sexual assault.”
Arrests for liquor law violations fell by half, from 15 reports in 2013 to seven in 2014. Alcohol related disciplinary referrals remained relatively constant with 555 reports in 2014, down from 563 the previous year.
The report also showed a marked decline in drug violations, both arrests and disciplinary violations. There were 41 disciplinary violations for drug violations in 2014, down from 114 in 2013. The number of drug related arrests went from 40 to 18 over the same period.
Carry said there was no change in University policy that may have contributed to the decrease in drug violations.
Robberies declined from 17 cases in 2013 to 11 in 2014 while aggravated assaults increased from eight to 10. Grand theft auto instances fell sharply from 21 reports to six.
The report is published annually to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, which requires colleges and universities that receive federal aid to report campus crime data.

Gals and goals · The women’s soccer team will be trying to find the back of the net more often in Pac-12 Conference play after totaling just 13 goals through 10 games to begin the regular season. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team will face Washington State on Thursday before taking on Washington on Sunday.
The Women of Troy got off to a positive start in conference play after defeating Oregon State 2-1 at home. USC had the better of the play, putting the Beavers on their heels for much of the afternoon.
The team logged 23 shots, hitting the target eight times and forcing Beaver goalkeeper Bella Geist to make several saves.
“I thought we did a really good job of framing the goal and getting people in the box,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after the game. “I feel like we’re running into the box really well right now.”
McAlpine praised his team’s ability to get into dangerous areas on offense. However, he still wants to see his team improve when it comes to finishing chances.
“I’d like us to still be a little more efficient on that end, especially with the quality of the chances that we’re creating,” he said.
The team has averaged more than 22 shots per game in its past five contests, which has put opponents under tremendous pressure.
Not so coincidentally, the Women of Troy are undefeated in their past five games.
McAlpine was satisfied with the win over Oregon State, but the team conceded a goal in the waning moments of the match, as the Beavers tried to mount a comeback.
The two-goal deficit was too large for Oregon State to overcome, but McAlpine said that his team’s ability to close out games will need to improve in the future.
“That’s an area that we have to clean up if we want to be the best team that we can be,” he said. “That’s a detail that has to improve.”
The Women of Troy have scored nearly twice as many goals as they have conceded this season. A big reason for that is their domination in midfield.
Nicole Molen, Morgan Andrews and Mandy Freeman were a dominant trio yet again, as USC edged out Oregon State.
“I feel very comfortable with Mandy and Morgan in the midfield,” Molen said. “I feel like we have a good system going, and I feel like if we keep rolling with it it’s going to bring good things.”
The three central midfielders have also shown their ability to maintain organization on defense.
“We talked about trying to be a really solid defensive team,” McAlpine said.
In addition, he noted that his team is not only defending well but is also eliminating set pieces for the opposition. This will be key for the team against Washington State and Washington, two talented squads from the Pac-12 North.
McAlpine will be looking for defensive organization and discipline, but he also stressed that he wants to keep opposing sides off the scoreboard. His message to his team moving forward is quite simple: continue to grow.
McAlpine also explained that the team is getting better at building out of the back and is looking more fluid in terms of getting into the final third.
“It’s just about getting better. This is just the beginning, not the end,” McAlpine said.
Washington State, an NSCAA top-25 team, enjoyed a terrific start to the campaign and sits at 8-1-0 heading into the USC game.
Washington, meanwhile, is in the same boat as USC, in that it is on the outside of the top- 25 looking in. The Huskies are looking to bounce back after tying Gonzaga and falling to Arizona.
As the Women of Troy venture to the Northwest to take on these two teams, McAlpine will be returning to familiar territory. He served as the head coach at Washington State for two seasons, earning Pac-12 Coach of the Year honors in 2013.
“It’s always good to go and see some old friends and see some players that you’ve spent a lot of time with and still love,” McAlpine said. “You want them to do well — just not too well when we play them.”

No. 17-ranked USC was back on Howard Jones Field on Wednesday  for one last practice before taking a couple of well-deserved days off during its bye week.
First off, sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was not at practice again on Wednesday for personal reasons.
“As a coach I have to be there for my players,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “Right now that’s the status that it is.”
An advantage of the bye week is that the coaches have the flexibility to move some players around and in order to try different lineups and give them experience at other positions. Freshman Dominic Davis — who has been playing at tailback in games — received some snaps at wide receiver.
Sophomore offensive tackle Toa Lobendahn saw some snaps at center as well.
“With the bye week, you have the chance to move some guys around a bit,” Sarkisian said.
The bye week also allows the coaching staff to get out on the road and look at potential recruits. Sarkisian said that he and some of his coaching staff  would be heading out after practice to jump back on the recruiting trail.
“This is a great chance for us to get on the road, see some games, go to high schools,” Sarkisian, who plans on utilizing the next two days to visit potential players  said after practice.  “We don’t have the natural bye that normal people do, so we have to take advantage of our days we have.”
After practice, Sarkisian talked about the committment of wide receiver Michael Pittman, who becomes the fourth spring 2016 enrollee for the Trojans after signing a financial-aid agreement. The second-year head coach believes that Pittman’s physicality will yield dividends on the field for USC.
“The big physical receivers are a real presence for us,” Sarkisian said. “I think he’s going to provide that same mold for us.”
Sarkisian is widely known as a skilled recruiter. ESPN ranked USC’s 2015 recruiting class as the third best in the country, but, it’s no secret that USC’s reputation as one of the nation’s most storied programs in the country helps too.
One of the recruits that Sarkisian previously sealed the deal on National Signing Day was sophomore Adoree’ Jackson, who has displayed his outstanding speed sparingly thus far this season in all three phases of the game.
Jackson had an 80-yard touchdown on Saturday against ASU. On the game, he put up 131 yards on three receptions.
“I don’t think anybody can get me … if we were in the open field, and if he had an angle, and I had to use my speed, I doubt it,” Jackson said. “So at the same time, I try to make sure that I don’t use my speed as much, so I lull them to sleep — then you think you got it — then I turn it on and go.”
Plays like last week’s against Arizona State make it mandatory for Sarkisian and his coaching staff to find ways to get Jackson the ball. It’s his confidence in his ability that makes Jackson deadly.
When he saw an Arizona State linebacker signal blitz and the safety drop back, he said he knew he was going to score. When watching Jackson play on offense, comparing former running back Reggie Bush and Jackson seems almost unavoidable.
“There is about one guy I can compare him to, and I am not allowed to say his name around here,” Sarkisian said. “Obviously as a staff, we’ve been beating ourselves for days thinking, ‘How do we find a way to keep getting number two the ball.’”
Junior linebacker Jabari Ruffin, who practiced with the first team today, largely attributes the young players’ improvement and effectiveness to defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s platoon substitution system.
With this system in place, players often practice with the first, second and third string defenses, which Ruffin says is an opportunity that allows them to work on fundamentals.
Wilcox’s constant influx of talent appears to promote competition in practice and get the most out of his players.
“With extra time with the bye week, we’re going to look back on defensive film so far,” Ruffin said. “Whether that be the Stanford game or the ASU game, we just want to look at things that got us and things we really need to focus on in order to be a great defense and as close to perfect as we can.”
Additionally, Cameron Smith and Iman Marshall highlight a freshmen class filled with superb, impactful players who are already exceeding the high expectations of them this season.
“I think that was the coaches’ goal: to get some of these younger guys to play. And I think that we are doing a great job at that. I think we are getting really comfortable,” said Smith, who leads the defense in tackles.
Smith believes that practices like Wednesday’s, where the team spent the majority of the time in 11 on 11, are a reason for his success. Smith noted that going against USC’s offensive line and offense, that is perhaps the best in the Pac 12, forces his defense to play more physical — helping them to get off blocks faster, work on schemes and establish a better understanding of how they can be most effective.
Along with simulating game play situations in 11 on 11 work, players also hope to use this extra time off to get healthy and take care of their bodies.
“I mean, with the bye week, we like to go back more and focus more on ourselves, fundamentals, techniques and our footwork,” defensive tackle Cody Temple said. But the motto has really  been ‘Come back ready to work,’ and that’s how it is.”
The Trojans will finish up their bye week and continue to prepare and improve with the heart of their schedule coming up, beginning with next Thursday night’s game at home against Washington.

Winning really does solve everything in college football. A week after being embarrassed by the Stanford Cardinal, 41-31, the Trojans blew out the Arizona State Sun Devils, 42-14.
Last week everybody was calling for head coach Steve Sarkisian and defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s heads after another disappointing, early season loss. Fast-forward to today, and some experts think the Trojans will win the Pac-12 South. That’s how much opinions can change from week to week.
As a coach at USC, this is the reality that you have to live with.
The limelight is always shining on you, and it’s basically win or go home for every game. I guess that’s what happens when fans are spoiled from the Pete Carroll era.
But let’s look back at the harsh criticism that the Trojan coaching staff, especially Wilcox, received after a beating from the Cardinal.
Yes, the Trojans were clearly outplayed by the Cardinal and had no answer for the Stanford power running game. The most frustrating part of the game had to have been Stanford converting on 8-12 third downs. The Trojans had numerous chances to get the ball back down one score but couldn’t come through.
As the defensive coordinator, Wilcox was bound to take some heat for the loss, and his job may have been on the line if the Trojans dropped another game to the Sun Devils. Looking back, it seems like the heat on Wilcox was sort of uncalled for.
The Cardinal rolled into the Coliseum as double-digit underdogs after their shocking opening season loss to Northwestern. Every expert picked the Trojans to dismantle the Cardinal on the fact that Stanford couldn’t score a touchdown against Northwestern. Some pretty flawed logic right there.
In fact, the Cardinal may be one of the best teams in the Pac-12 this season. In games not against Northwestern, Stanford has scored an average of 38 points per game while averaging more than 480 yards of total offense.
It seems that all those experts saying Stanford had no offense after one game were too quick to judge.
Or maybe Northwestern, who is currently undefeated, is a pretty good defensive football team.
After all, the Wildcats are only giving up 266 yards a game, good for 11th best in the country, and 8.8 points a game, good for third best in the country. To put it frankly, Stanford’s loss to Northwestern was more about name recognition and less about realizing that the Wildcats are a good football team.
Now, I’m guessing you’re wondering how this relates to Wilcox.
Basically, in games not against Stanford, the USC defense has looked outstanding.
In games against Arkansas State, Idaho and Arizona State, the Trojans have forced eight turnovers and given up a combined 29 points –— 12 less than they gave up to Stanford.
USC was expected to blow out Idaho and Arkansas State, which they did with ease. When the defense faltered against the Cardinal, all eyes were on Wilcox.
Though the Trojans were atrocious on defense against Stanford, they were spectacular against Arizona State. If you didn’t know any better, you would have thought a different team was playing.
The Arizona State game wasn’t the prettiest when you look at the team stats.
USC outgained the Sun Devils by just one yard and Arizona State controlled time of possession.
The difference maker was the defense’s ability to turn the ball over and stop the Sun Devils on third down, two things the Trojans failed to do last week against the Cardinal.
Though the offense was prolific as usual, it was the defense that came up huge time and time again.
With the Sun Devils driving at the end of the first half, Su’a Cravens forced a fumble that was returned 94 yards for a touchdown, giving the Trojans a 28-0 lead.
That fumble all but took the life out of the Sun Devils, as they fumbled on the very next play leading to another touchdown. Going into the half trailing by 14 would have given the Sun Devils hope.
As long as the Trojan defense continues to play well, Wilcox will be in the clear. Another blow out loss and that Stanford game would look less and less like an anomaly and more like the norm.
It’s time we stop judging coaches after one game and let the season play itself out. In a few weeks, that Stanford loss could look much better, especially if Northwestern continues to win.
After all, Wilcox’s defense looked pretty darn good last week.

Wilcox might be better than you think. It really was not a blowout with the key fumbles by ASU amounting to a 21 pt. swing at the end of the first half. The Sun Devils gained a good amount of yardage . Wilcox has accomplished very little in his year plus with the Trojans, and the same amt. at UW.

Freshman year you might pick out clothes the night before class, senior year you can only hope you have enough clean underwear to go to class. Katie Matthews | Daily Trojan
A lot changes from freshman year to senior year. Priorities shift, energy decreases and clothes become more socially acceptable. There are a few dead giveaways to differentiate the freshmen from the seniors. I would like to take a look at classroom outfits as well as going out outfits to show you how to spot the differences.
Perfectly combed hair, no smudged eyeliner and a pleasant aroma are all signs that you are a first year. It’s understandable, freshmen are still making tons of first impressions and meeting new people, so they want to look and smell their best. The female freshmen in your class are likely to be wearing a sort of visible bra-let. High school dress codes prevented these girls from expressing their sense of style in past years, and now that they have their freedom of expression back, they would like to show their undergarments.
If you are thinking, “Hey! I am not a freshman, and I wear visible bra-lets!?” Think back to when you bought that bra-let — you were a freshman. Another freshman trend in the classroom is the crop top. Call me old fashioned, but I stand on a firm belief that your professor should be unaware if you have an innie or outie belly button. It seems that the more midriff you are showing in class, the younger you are.
The seniors in your class are by no means more conservative, but they are less worried about the impressions they are making. They don’t have time to plan out a cute outfit for class and instead throw on whatever they can find. Most often, it is whatever on their floor smelled the cleanest. If you see a senior dressed to the nines in your class wish her luck on her interview, because chances are that is where she’s headed next.
As far as nightlife goes, freshmen can get away with anything. You may never look as good as you do as a freshman so I say go for it! They go sleeveless, pantless, shirtless, you name it. They will make the mistake of wearing heels to a house party, and they will probably make the mistake twice. FYI: It is an unwritten rule that if you are going to wear heels to a house party, only booties are acceptable.
As a senior, you know the first sip of carbonation will make you bloat and you plan accordingly. The most effort you will put into your outfit is a bold lip color. You strive for comfort, and thus can be spotted in loose clothing and Converse. Your comfort will allow you to be confident in socializing because you’re not worried about an outfit disaster. You will say hi to everyone, be the life of the party and still make it home before midnight.
From freshman to senior year, your style never really evolves. You just get more comfortable with yourself.

True colours · Dallas Green, whose performing alias is City and Colour, releases his new album If I Should Go Before You Oct. 9. The singles released include “Woman,” “Wasted Love” and “Lover Come Back.” – Photo courtesy of Dustin Rabin
City and Colour’s newest album, If I Should Go Before You, marks a departure from his signature folksy sound. Though the tracks will make listeners nostalgic for the cheerful, acoustic backdrops of “The Girl” and “Sleeping Sickness,”
singer-songwriter Dallas Green, under his alias of City and Colour, promises a refreshing new direction for his music.
Green hinted at this diversion from his earlier work in July. In a message on his website, Green said, “Over the last two years I’ve had the great pleasure of touring with an unbelievable group of musicians, who I can now safely call some of my best friends. If I Should Go Before You
is the record I made with those friends.” These influences contributed to the album’s 11 tracks.
If I Should Go Before You starts with “Woman,” a haunting piece reminiscent of Bon Iver’s drifty style in For Emma. With a heavier guitar accompaniment than prior City and Colour songs, “Woman” is an epic, nine-minute prelude to the rest of the album. The instrumental section has psychedelic rock influences, before transitioning into the lyrics, “Woman, my love is never ending / Like a sea without a shore / Woman, I’m a fool guilty of old crimes / But you are the one I adore.”
“Wasted Love,” the sixth track  and second single from the album, features Green’s solo songwriting skills without his band. The lyrics deviate from other tracks, underlining Green’s prior experiences with, “Careless love / Quit pouring honey in my ears / You’re speaking diamonds crystal clear / So far away I want you near.” These lyrics, along with echoing Southern rock bands such as White Denim and Delta Spirit, explain Green’s disillusionment, starkly contrasting “The Girl.”
The final single released from the album further underscores Green’s shift to darker tones. “Lover Come Back” spotlights lyrics, “I sing lover come back / Lover come back to me / Won’t you ever come back / Ever come back to me” that play alongside a downtrodden melody. It is clear in this song that Green provides a corollary to the optimism portrayed in 2008’s Bring Me Your Love.
Despite Green’s new style, fans of previous City and Colour albums should still look into If I Should Go Before You. “Map of the World” still provides a slight glimpse into Green’s former sound, and the acoustic guitar backs this song. The track, though still showcasing layered lyrics, focuses less on the band and more on Green’s rich, unique voice. The final track, “Blood,” achieves the same effect and the words show Green’s sense of belonging. Lyrics “The sound is just rising up / Mother birds feeding their young / Light of the brand new day / I think I’ve found a home in this place” denote the journey of the album.
If I Should Go Before You proves to fans that they should not be apprehensive of Green’s latest work. As demonstrated by Mumford and Sons earlier this year with Wilder Mind, musical artists redefining their sound is something that listeners should look forward to.
If I Should Go Before You will be released on Oct. 9.

My friends and I joke that we have vitamin D deficiency thanks to sunless Melbourne. Luckily, a cure was imminent — a 10-day holiday to Bali.
Because of Australia’s proximity to Asia, I seized the opportunity to explore a new country on a continent I had never visited before. We decided to spend our university spring break period in Indonesia because I have never been to Asia before. I knew virtually nothing about Indonesia, so I was keen to ask a lot of questions to learn about the seemingly unknown country. The answers did not fully prepare me for the adventure I was about to embark on.
Bali is famous for its beautiful beaches, authentic Indonesian cuisine, breathtaking nature, volcanoes — which are inactive for the most part — and thousands of temples that scatter the land. The ocean water is very nice, especially in the Gili Islands, which are more than an hour away by boat from the mainland. Hiking the volcanoes provides breathtaking views of the sunrise, as well as friendly encounters with cheeky monkeys. These monkeys are adorable, but also quite mischievous. One monkey stole an entire pack of biscuits from a girl’s backpack, while another would throw crackers on the ground that it deemed unacceptable.
Temples play a prominent role in Balinese culture. On almost every street corner, there is some form of mini sanctuary that features a carved, usually black statue that locals decorate and leave banana leaf baskets of fruit and flower offerings. The nature is breathtaking with views of rice fields, forests and
ever-present wildlife.
Smells wafting from the market place meld with the colors of crocheted clothing and dream catchers, creating a sensational experience. Color is a dominant force in Bali, with the abundance of distinctive fruits and colors incorporated into small restaurants and beach clubs. One beach in particular features a multicolored brasserie with rainbow bean bag chairs and umbrellas perfect for watching the sunset on the beach
Bali is an especially attractive destination for Aussies — not only because of its proximity, but also because of its cheap prices. Meals cost anywhere from $5 to $12, and taxi rides generally cost just only a couple of dollars. Spa treatments are especially cost effective, as basic one-hour massages only cost $5. The tourism market has a large presence throughout the cities; one block can have several hotels in a row providing a variety of experiences for visitors.
In front of these tourist hubs, however, social inequality is very apparent. When walking anywhere, faces of poverty loom. Young Balinese men approach incoming tourists offering them rides on motorbikes, even offering to place three people on one bike in order to make a sale. Peddlers on the beach offer a variety of services including pedicures, henna tattoos and massages, while others sell products and food. I found the peddlers carrying bamboo sticks that have peanut plants suspended on either side to be particularly distinctive. The worst appearance of the country’s poverty, however, is the young children who walk barefoot trying to sell bracelets to make ends meet.
While marveling at the inexpensive nature of Bali, it is hard to remember just how dire the situation is for some. They remind us of simple things we take for granted. For example, the bathrooms may not flush properly because of the eco-water system that attempts to conserve water, yet in so many houses in the suburbs, indoor plumbing is a luxury, as are sturdy doors and glass window panes.
Around USC, it’s pretty hard to miss levels of income disparity within a five-mile radius. People dwelling on the street, potentially walking around at night or living in small houses that relied on the University Village as a source of income are all parts of reality encountered daily. However, in Bali, there is an appearance of financial equality when it is actually a developing nation. The GDP per capita of Indonesia is about $3,475.  Out of the country’s population of more than 252 million, 28 million live under the poverty line.  The inequity fuels the underground market, as theft, drug dealing and prostitution leave a mark on Bali’s tourism.
One of my friends exchanged Australian dollars to Indonesian Rupiah one day and experienced the effects of the underground market’s presence. Despite taking painstaking precautionary measures, carefully counting the money that was returned, and holding her purse tightly, upon arrival to the hotel she noticed a good chunk of money was clearly missing. The experience was almost a violation of her personal bubble. Here she was trying to give the exchangers a fair opportunity in exchange for their deflating currency. The amount, though, was clearly not enough, as a person snuck out a sizeable portion out of the wad of 50,000 rupiah bills. Pickpocketing of phones and wallets is also particularly common.
Infrastructure and traffic control is virtually absent here. When we asked our hotel for directions to the bank, he told us, “It’s right after the first stoplight!” To me, it was alarming that the stoplight, despite its dilapidated nature, was a frame of reference for directions. Cars commonly pass using the opposing lanes. Motorcyclists, riding without helmets, drive through the sidewalks, honking at pedestrians
Visiting Bali exposed me to a common duality — the experience of the tourist and the experience of the local — in a way I have never seen. Though Bali offers ample experiences in both relaxation and exploration, it also provides a humbling factor, one that is met with vigilance but also a sense of understanding.

Director Wes Ball is back for a second installment of a series based on the best-selling young adult book series The Maze Runner. Last year, the first film of the series was released with relative success as an enthralling, action-packed teen flick. Though the plot structure was far from complex, it utilized the conventions of a dystopian future that made it a feel-good film due to its predictability.
Picking up where The Maze Runner left off, Scorch Trials follows Thomas (Dylan O’Brien)  after he and his friends have broken free of the deadly labyrinth they were trapped in with no memory of their capture and must form their own primitive society to survive. O’Brien and his fellow prisoners, called the Gladers, soon realize that the World in Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department, the group that had been caring for them, is dangerous and controlling. They then make their escape. The Gladers begin their torturous journey of survival in a dystopian wasteland as a virus that turns humans into
zombie-mutants ravages the landscape. Thomas and his friends attempt to find the fabled resistance troops as they outrun an ever-growing number of enemies.
Working within the confines of a mid-franchise movie, O’Brien shines through the weak structure. Despite his inadequacies as a leader, he proves himself to be a likable and genuine character throughout the adventure. Even the most skeptical audience members will be gripped by Thomas’s ability to evade death by the skin of his teeth, driving his pack forward on their mission. However, the film never gets too in depth into his character, making him less intriguing than the first movie. Perhaps they are saving the juicy details and plot lines for the final installment of the trilogy.
Other highlights of the movie include performances from the rest of the Gladers. The symbiosis between Thomas, Teresa Agnes (Kaya Scodelario), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Newt (Thomas
Brodie-Sangster), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores) provides an on-screen chemistry that is reminiscent of the cast of The Walking Dead. As the rest of the Gladers fight off infectious zombies, their perilous journey has audience members sitting on the edge of their seats. Additionally, the main antagonist, Janson (Aidan Gillen) creates a spooky quality that rivals the intensity of the zombies on screen.
Regardless, Scorch Trials is overwhelmingly predictable and adds nothing new to the dystopian action genre made popular by the Hunger Games trilogy. The dialogue features sappy reflections over the departed Gladers that don’t necessarily live up to Katniss Everdeen’s diatribes about the oppressive society in District 13. At least the first movie kept viewers questioning why Thomas and the Gladers were in the maze in the first place. Scorch Trials is an easy watch for those looking to get a quick rush from the astounding special effects and evil villains.
The new conflicts and relationships ultimately try to hook the audience members into purchasing a ticket to The Death Cure, due to be released  in 2017. But for now, catch The Scorch Trials in theaters.

Though many applaud the diverse roles television showcases, there is a much darker truth that lies behind the camera. A few weeks ago, the Director’s Guild of America published its latest report, which looks into the gender and ethnicity of directors in television and other internet networks such as Netflix and Amazon. During the 2014-2015 TV season, women directed 16 percent of shows, as opposed to 14 percent last year. While this is an increase, the improvement is too little too late.
“It is just a drop in the bucket,” said Paris Barclay, president of the DGA.
Female TV directors are swimming in a pool of male dominance accompanied by little to no racial minority representation. And while female TV directors made a small improvement, the same cannot be said for minority groups in television. The DGA reported that minorities, both male and female, directed 18 percent of all episodes, a drop from the previous year.
In regard to the inequality of women and minority groups in film production, Barclay said, “Without employers making a concerted effort to bringing a more diverse mix of new entrants to the hiring pool, we will not see meaningful and lasting change.” Though Barclay’s words ring true, little has been done to rectify the situation.
The report  also includes a “Worst Of” list composed of shows that hired women or minority directors for fewer than 15 percent of episodes. Some shows on this list did not hire a single woman or minority all season. Boardwalk Empire, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Supernatural are among the television shows featured on this list. Lucrative television shows do not feel the need to diversify as long as their success continues.
The report also shines a light on the “Best Of” list, which includes shows that hired women or minority directors for at least 40 percent of episodes. Homeland, Madam Secretary and Modern Family are among the shows listed. All of these shows highlight how people of diverse backgrounds can come together to produce nuanced television. This is executed by making the conscious effort to portray characters with varying backgrounds.
At the bottom of the report, the DGA includes a diversity statement that reads, “We believe storytelling should be as diverse as the world around us, and that a critical mass of different perspectives on screen is vital for the wellbeing and development of society.” One day, television will reflect the diverse world we live in, but that day is not today.
Hollywood has been in need of diversity since its inception. Though years have passed, the inequality of women and minority groups has persisted. This lack of female and racially diverse representation in film production distorts the image of those groups in film and television. It is time for women and minority groups to be given the chance to take control of their representation in film and television, which will promote a more accurate and honest portrayal of women and racialy diverse groups.
Meanwhile, film students here are affected by the lack of women and minority representation in film production. Students are given the daunting task of shaping the future of film production — the embodiment of the fast-paced, nuanced world around us that can ultimately propel social change. Current USC film students will forge their own path in an industry that is in need of change.  In light of this report, film students should welcome the opportunity to promote diversity in film production.
Hopefully in the years to come, greater strides will be made in the film and television industry. It is important to point out the inequality that still persists in film production, but it is by far more essential to act upon these feelings.

This letter is in response to Sen. Giuseppe Robalino’s letter to the editor, published Sept. 30, entitled “Women’s Student Assembly Plays Partisan Politics.”
Sen. Robalino repeatedly attempts to diminish the work WSA does by accusing us of engaging in abstract theory and partisan politics. What the senator fails to understand, however, is that patriarchy isn’t an abstract theory, but an ideology that manifests itself in very real ways.
WSA engages in politics because the personal is inherently political. To reduce that to partisanship or to call it “a matter of philosophy” is to ignore the real- world applications of these forces on the lives of our constituents.
Sen. Robalino refers to WSA as an “unelected body.” The directors of WSA are in fact directly elected by our constituents. Sen. Robalino’s inability to understand the structure of our organization certainly does not inspire much confidence in his ability to understand our programs or the mission of our organization.
In fact, Robalino has fundamentally misunderstood our mission, stating that WSA has the “privilege of resources to focus solely on sexual assault and domestic violence.” WSA programs a diverse variety of events such as Body Love Week (which is coming up Oct. 5 – 9) , a week about empowerment, healing and body positivity. Yes, we do program around the issue of sexual assault and domestic violence, because these are two important issues in our constituencies; however, it would be short-sighted and ignorant to imply that these are the sole concerns our constituents have.
On the topic of sexual assault and gender-based harm, Robalino seems to, again, misconstrue WSA’s job. The Women’s Student Assembly is part of Program Board. It is our job to program.
The Center for Women and Men, an organization we work with closely, provides crucial resources on campus and is absolutely necessary to combat sexual assault. But our jobs are not the same. Furthermore, to characterize preventing sexual assault and aiding survivors as “nonpolitical health issues” is to ignore the root causes of sexual assault, which includes rape culture and victim blaming.
Robalino also claims that WSA has established relationships with the Service Employees International Union and is, therefore, a clearly partisan organization. WSA has invited SEIU to participate in a panel, giving students the opportunity to engage in a dialogue around the Faculty Forward Campaign. This is not an issue of partisanship. It is an example in facilitating discussion and debate.
Finally, Robalino attempts to demean the work WSA does by accusing the assembly of spending “valuable time correcting the spelling of words like ‘history’ to ‘hxstory.’” He is clearly not concerned with our time, here, but rather with maintaining the status quo. WSA chooses to spell words differently to bring attention to inherently patriarchal values in our language. We challenge these values not only in our words, but also in our programming, which uplifts the voices of those who are systemically silenced. Robalino purposefully ignores these programs in his letter.
This is not the first time Sen. Robalino has called into question student organizations in Program Board. During the Senate meeting on April 28th of this year, Robalino attempted to block the funding of Program Board on the grounds of “political biases” in the Academic Cultural Assembly and Speakers Committee, two organizations dedicated to sparking dialogue in a balanced manner. He has consistently shown that he would rather use his position to silence student voices rather than listen to them.
We would encourage you, Senator, to take a good look at the constituency you represent. Rather than accusing WSA of wasting our valuable time, perhaps you should use your time to engage in a dialogue around what USC students actually want and need. Because we shouldn’t have to remind you that your stipend is also paid for by the student programming fee.

We know that the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, and we know that this is a defining issue that is affecting our generation. This Friday, Oct. 2, millennials on 70 college campuses across the country will participate in KNOW TOMORROW, the student-led movement that will serve as a milestone in history, as our nation’s youth unite to consolidate and amplify a message to inspire action on climate change. Driven by Cool Globes and The Climate Reality Project, our national day of action will be a significant demonstration of why the time to act is now, as we count down to the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, this December.
COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, will be the latest in a long series of meetings since 1992 and a crucial one, with the goal of achieving a legally binding, international agreement on climate that keeps global warming below 2°C. Many are asserting that COP21 will be the last effective opportunity for the world to collaborate and take global-scale action before catastrophic consequences take effect. Our window of opportunity is increasingly getting smaller while the problems are exponentially growing larger.
Recently at USC, many students have been calling for our University to take action regarding environmental sustainability. Events, programs and initiatives on our campus have served as catalysts for change, but we must push harder to avoid the devastating impacts of climate change. The USC environmental community is banding together with the rest of the nation to make our voices heard as we create a better vision of tomorrow that we all want to see. It will be the singular campaign to demonstrate the energy and enthusiasm that America’s youth has regarding their future.
KNOW TOMORROW not only has the support of students, professors, faculty, organizations and activists, but also other prominent figures have weighed in to lend their support. Shepard Fairey designed posters for the campaign, and musical artists and celebrities — including Common, Train, Ian Somerhalder and Chris Evans — appeared in videos to promote the campaign. Environmental leaders such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Vice President Al Gore will be speaking on college campuses to help amplify our collective vision, and dozens of other celebrities will lend their help via social media.
This is neither the beginning nor the end. It’s not only a concern of yesterday, but a critical moment right now for a hopeful tomorrow. It is my hope that KNOW TOMORROW will continue to spark discussion and conversation regarding positive solutions for our future. The “Road to Paris” is growing shorter by each day, but the shared narrative formed by the ever-increasing community of people is also developing and progressing into a wonderful story that will soon be known to the world.
Join the chorus of voices and attend KNOW TOMORROW anytime between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. in McCarthy Quad, which will be transformed into a space where students can listen to an impressive roster of speakers, participate in engaging activities to learn about how they can impact climate change and spark further dialogue that will help call our country’s leaders to action at COP21. The USC day of action will start with an activity fair from 2 – 4:30 p.m., followed by a two-part speaker series from 4:30 – 6:30 p.m. and again from 7-10 p.m.
Let’s be the generation that saves the world as we demand a better tomorrow. See you on Friday.
Shawn Rhoads
Event Director of KNOW TOMORROW
“… the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real…” I have actually never heard a single person claim that the climate is not constantly changing and has been doing so for the past several billion years. Changing climate is kind of like the tides coming in and out or the sun rising every morning. We can be sure it will never stop. The question of whether human beings are suddenly causing climate to change of course is a completely different issue and rests on whether the very small human input of CO2 (plant food), adding to the current level of CO2, a trace atmospheric gas at approximately 0.04%, and a minor greenhouse gas anyway, remains unresolved. 95% of the greenhouse effect comes from water vapor-as in the clouds etc, and current CO2 levels are certainly not high, representing less than a fifth of the levels during the age of the dinosaurs for example. Adolescent socialist activists like “Trojan staff” here, never seem to bother with such minor details but are very good at writing dumb, rousing political activist drivel for brainwashed mobs to act on. I’m genuinely open-minded about the whole thing, and would just like to see some rational evidence to support the ANTHROPOGENIC climate change scenario, where anthropogenic means some significant MAN-MADE climate change effect, beyond what happens each time I fart for dog’s sake. I’m very concerned however that simpleminded people can be induced to act on emotional, non-evidence-based rubbish, because it reminds me of the mob rousing acts of crucifixions, witchhunts, wars and revolutions (think Syria) that have misled the human race and caused so much misery and suffering through the ages.
The last 5 years of data is pointing towards the return of at least a mini ice-age.  The Summer Arctic Sea Ice Extent has not been any lower than it was in 2007.  In fact the Arctic Sea Ice Extent has been recovering since 2007.  Antarctic Ice Sheet is increasing in size over past 5 years.  The sea level rise has not happened for the last 5 years.  Ontario and Quebec and the entire North-east US have been getting cooler.  Global Warming is no longer being supported by the data, just the globalist conspiracy politics of U.N. Agenda 21.
Shows how corrupt science is in the science-fraternity.  There’s no real world observable warming. More events of cold.   Australia is supposed to be the hottest continent but we’ve had mild summers for years and in past few years extreme cold winters.  Northern Hemisphere is probably heading for another extreme winter.  Global-Warming is a Political Agenda.

Earlier this month, custodial workers at USC took to Trousdale Parkway to protest for higher wages and healthcare benefits, as three months have passed since their labor contract ended and negotiations so far have fallen flat. The issue isn’t new. USC’s transition to a subcontractor for its custodial services nearly 20 years ago incited workers’ protests to unionize. Since their unionization in 1997, labor contracts have been contentious, with workers fighting for a living wage and dignity in the workplace.
Workers have been without a contract since late June. It’s time that USC, despite not being a direct employer, steps in on behalf of the custodial staff who work on campus and oversees the negotiation of a fair and proper contract.
USC has subcontracted the custodial services it needs through a company called Aramark since beginning in 2001. You may have heard of them — they supply uniforms, school lunches, labor and other related services to thousands of schools, universities, companies and even prison systems across the country. Aramark negotiates with Services Employee International Union, the labor union that represents workers on campus.
Rather than directly hiring employees, USC hires a third party, who in turn hires custodians to staff the University. The University has no direct involvement to negotiations — which can be problematic. Custodians and related staff have a starting wage at $9.75, which in today’s economy is hardly a livable income. For a full-time worker, that comes out to roughly $1,560 per month or $18,720 per year, excluding benefits. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the poverty line for a family of four in the U.S. is $24,250 per year. That means a custodian at USC who works full-time and may be the sole source of income to support a family of four lives below the poverty line.
At a university that claims to be top-tier and elite, this is grossly unacceptable. In Los Angeles, the median-home value is $378,390, which translates to a roughly $1,820 per month mortgage. To live in a median-valued home in L.A., you’d have to make at least $72,730 per year, according to the California Association of Realtors.
All these numbers and statistics point to one thing — the custodial staff at USC is egregiously underpaid and undervalued. Before USC subcontracted its labor, staff were treated with respect. They used to be given tickets to football games and treated as an integral part of the University.
Janitors keep our campus looking nice and clean. Our campus wouldn’t function without all the maintenance, upkeep and hard work these individuals put in. USC owes it to the custodial staff to apply pressure on  Aramark to negotiate a contract that gives workers a livable wage, acceptable healthcare benefits and the treatment they deserve.
The administration needs to ensure that custodial staff who work on campus are treated fairly and with respect. Two hundred-forty workers are now without a contract, and the University should set a deadline of Oct. 31, four months since the expiration of the last contract, for the two parties to come to a mutual conclusion and contract. The administration, led by the University’s Facilities Management Services, has a responsibility that those who work on campus are treated with a certain standard and degree of professionalism and respect. Union laborers can’t work without a contract and it’s time a contract is negotiated and agreed upon. USC needs to make sure of that.
For the staff who help keep our campus clean, fresh and looking like a cutting-edge school, it’s time USC start acting like one and support the very people who do so.

Looking for a new, chill study hub where you can sip on something sweet? Rewts Tea Bar is your destination. Conveniently located on South Hoover, a hip tea bar nestled in the busy L.A. area sits across from student favorites such as the Nature’s Brew and Bacaro. Rewts Tea Bar offers visitors not only a variety of hot and cold tea beverages, but also a relaxed yet modern ambience, perfect for finishing up an assignment, reading a book or scrolling through Pinterest; outlets are in abundance. 
Though the location is narrow and a bit tight on space, Rewts still offers a decent amount of seating for those looking to stick around. Up front is a small table by the window on a little patch of “grass,” and bar-­style seating is available alongside the workspace of the baristas. Past the front counter, there are tables with backless chairs on one side and booth-­style seating but with a more industrial feel. It’s basically a block of cement, but the pillows definitely add color and accents to the environment. On the opposite side are little individual work spaces in triangle shapes attached to the wall. This is perfect if you want to enjoy the cafe but need a little bit of your own space.

As far as the tea goes, Rewts offers customers a variety of hot and iced teas including tea lattes and blended smoothies. I had been told that their boba was a must-try. Eager to try the tea additive at this location, I visited and ordered the Rewts House Tea Latte Iced, but when it came time to add the boba to my order, I ran into some bad luck. I was informed that they had unfortunately sold out of their boba since they make it fresh daily. Better luck next time, I thought. 
I headed back the day after my first visit to take another shot at trying Rewts’ boba while I finished up an assignment. But to my dismay, I was once again confronted with the same dilemma; the last order had just been sold to the customer ahead of me. The employee apologized and kindly offered I try something else; he recommended the pudding to go with my matcha iced latte. 
“If you don’t like it, I’ll toss it out and make you something else at no charge,” he assured me. Though I was upset and a bit annoyed of not being able to sample their boba as I was reviewing the location, I did appreciate the heartfelt customer service. 
The texture of the pudding was a little too chunky for me, but it did add to the sweetness and flavor of the matcha. I enjoyed both their iced house tea and matcha lattes. The blend of flavors in the house tea went well with creamy milk and a bit of sweetener. The matcha was creamy as well but also had great earthy and calm flavor tones. 
If you’re looking for something more refreshing, I’d recommend trying a blended drink or an iced tea­. My friend got a blended drink with passion fruit, and it was sweet and tangy. Food is not yet for sale, so make sure to bring a snack or plan on heading across the street for some food if you’re know you’re going to get hungry. 
I will definitely be heading back to Rewts when I need to study or catch up with friends. Hopefully next time I won’t leave without the boba.

When I tell people that I want to go into a career in journalism one of the many different pessimistic or sarcastic reactions I often get is,
“So do you want to start a blog or something?”
Well, kind of, yes.
The first time I wrote for a blog was when I studied in Madrid last semester and started a blog to document my experiences. I know what you’re thinking, it’s the inevitable and basic “girl goes to Europe and starts a blog about it” story. Part of that is definitely true, however I’d be lying if I said that experience didn’t have a positive impact on my writing and my experience as a journalist.
As journalism major, I had grown accustomed to always removing myself from my writing. Throughout my college classes I learned the importance of being objective and refraining from inserting my own opinions and experiences into my writing.
Writing for my own blog was a much-welcomed change of pace, one that helped me to exercise my long neglected creative writing skills. I rediscovered how to add voice and character to my writing, something that has continued to help me even as I transition back to more traditional and objective stories.
When my family (my blog’s primary fan base) commented on my posts, or called me to talk about all the adventures I was having abroad, they often told me they felt like they could hear me reading my writing aloud to them — that it actually sounded like how I would tell them my stories in person. This is a skill I’ve tried to utilize in my writing whenever possible. After all, wouldn’t you rather read a story that sounds like a conversation with a friend rather than a teacher reading out of a textbook?
Additionally, writing on a regular basis about whatever was on my mind at the moment was not only therapeutic, but helped me come up with new story ideas and brainstorm topics I wanted to investigate further.
So to all the haters out there who sarcastically ask, “So you want to be a blogger?” There is really no shame in my answer being an unequivocal, “yes.” I’m not exactly advocating being a blogger as a primary source of income (sorry to say, but it’s probably not going to pay the bills) — but it has definitely been a positive way for me to develop my writing. Being able to publish your own stories is liberating, knowing that people will indeed see what you write, even it’s only a select few (and by few I mean mostly my grandparents).
Yet, the hesitation that surrounds that unequivocal “yes” is due to a certain stigma attached to blog writing. People assume that bloggers aren’t credible or reliable, that we sit in our pajamas staring at a computer screen all day eating a tub of ice cream (so what if I’m doing that right now…?), or that our sites are basically just diaries gone digital. Sometimes these assumptions are true, I’m not saying that your roommate’s Tumblr should be taken as gospel, but what I am saying is that reading and editing all of Daily Trojan’s blog posts the past month has only reinforced my belief that a little bit of blogging would do everyone some good.
Emily Goldberg is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism. She is also blogs editor of the Daily Trojan.

In this episode of “USC Cribs,” host Drew Schwendiman visits sophomore Josie Andrews’s chic downtown apartment. Andrews is a fan of the Disney movie Tangled and aimed to channel a princess theme with her decor.
She selected a black and white color scheme with lots of pink accents. The furniture is an eclectic mix of new items and flea market finds that Andrews refurbished.
Andrews rarely cooks, preferring to spend time cultivating her impressive shoe collection. She shared her penchant for sparkles and stilettos with our host. The tour ends on the balcony, which offers breathtaking city views.
Check out the video for a complete look inside Andrews’s luxurious pad, and be sure to follow “USC Cribs” on Facebook.

For the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) sanctioned 26 debates. For the 2016 primaries, it has sanctioned six. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the DNC, has stood firmly by her decision to allow only six official Democratic debates, despite criticism she has received from candidates, party officials (including two vice chairs) and Democratic voters alike.
In fact, just recently, at a party convention in New Hampshire, Schultz was heckled by Democratic voters demanding more debates. Her go-to response to such appeals is that she truly believes that there are a sufficient number of debates for the candidates to spread their ideas, and that they have other platforms they can use to gain exposure.
The problem is Schultz has blocked many of those platforms. Along with the debate schedule, she announced that any candidate who participates in a debate not sanctioned by the DNC will be barred from participating in future debates. As former Maryland governor and Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley pointed out, that’s not very democratic of the Democratic party.
Schultz’s actions are especially troubling because she was the co-chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. That is a conflict of interest worthy enough for Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as chairwoman of the DNC, regardless of her draconian debate restrictions.
Schultz has repeatedly asserted that she is not partial toward any particular candidate, and that her only goal is to get a Democrat in the White House in 2016. Her words hold very little weight when put against her actions. Politico reported that Clinton aides lobbied Schulz to limit the number of debates, and thus, limit the amount of un-choreographed exposure Clinton receives. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Schultz petitioning her to increase the number of debates. His petition garnered 90,000 signatures. But Schultz refused to consider Sanders’ request.  
It is common knowledge among political insiders – and within the Clinton campaign – that Clinton’s stale debate performances in 2008 lost her the primary. Those debates allowed the then-unknown Sen. Obama to gain national recognition and defeat Clinton (juggernaut as she was), who seemed distant and cold next to the charismatic young senator.
Schultz has already fallen out of favor with many top Democrats, including President Obama. Politico reported that the President and Democratic insiders believe that Schultz has used her power as DNC chair to further her own political status. For example, she is infamous for combining Democratic fundraisers with her own personal fundraisers. (She is continuing to build a war chest for future House campaigns.)
The pleas of Democratic voters to increase the number of debates have fallen on deaf ears. Schultz has made a conscious decision to ignore her party’s candidates and constituents.
This has far-reaching consequences, especially for millennial voters. Only 21.5 percent of registered voters ages 18-29 voted in the 2014 midterm elections. Less than half voted in the 2012 elections. Those numbers are abysmal; young people — America’s newest voters — are not exercising their democratic rights. Many millennials have become disillusioned by the political process. It’s not that they don’t care or are ill-informed about the issues — it’s that they feel as if the American political process does not empower everyday people.
A recent Chegg Media Center poll revealed that Bernie Sanders dominates Clinton when it comes to college students — 59 percent support him, while 18 percent support Clinton. Yet, the voter turnout numbers show that very few of those college students will actually vote in the primaries. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s efforts to rig the Democratic primaries serves only to confirm young voters’ cynicism. Voters will naturally become apathetic if they are led to believe that one candidate has already been anointed as the nominee.
Schultz has failed as the leader of the DNC. The fact that she has worked closely with Clinton in the past alone warrants her removal from the chair; her handling of the primaries disqualifies her even further. If America wishes to see its young people become engaged in the electoral process, it must censure this kind of dishonest establishment politics.
While I agree with your notion and really want to see DWS out of there, your facts are a little off. In 2008 the DNC sanctioned 6 debates, as they have every year since 1984. The other 20 were unsanctioned debates. The big problem with what DWS did wasn’t cutting debates, as she didn’t technically do that. It’s an exclusivity rule she put in this year, telling candidates that if they participate in any non-sanctioned debate, then they won’t be allowed in the sanctioned one. No such rule has ever existed, and her excuse of wanting to limit debates falls short, especially when you consider as far back as 1988 we had a total of 22 primary debates, 6 sanctioned. Even the vice-Chairs of the party are urging her to change it, but she won’t.
