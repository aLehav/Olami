One of the easiest ways to get involved in the movement toward a more eco-friendly lifestyle is shopping. There’s been an increasing tendency among designers to manufacture recycled or organic clothing to appeal to buyers looking to live greener.  Yoki’s Garden, a clothing company that recently partnered with USC, is one such manufacturer.

Yoki’s Garden is a division within the clothing company Generic Youth, started by the father-daughter team of Jeff and Coco Yokoyama.
While enrolled at the University of Oregon, Coco Yokoyama noticed an abundance of old athletic wear and specialty uniforms that were worn briefly before being thrown away.
“They wondered what happened to all the old uniforms once the teams were finished with them,” said Scott Andrews, the Yokoyamas’ business partner in Generic Youth clothing.  “They found that they either went to a garage sale or were gotten rid of and that this was a little market they could capture.”
This inquiry sparked the idea of a new business venture. Realizing that the market in used college athletic wear was virtually untapped, the Yokoyamas decided to try and create a business that used these materials.
Two years ago, the owners of Generic Youth began meeting with USC to discuss the idea of reusing old athletic apparel. Connected through Paul McDonald, the radio commentator of Trojan football games, the owners of Yoki’s Garden solidified the partnership about a month ago.
Yoki’s Garden now receives discarded USC athletic wear — everything from old football uniforms to equipment bags — and turns these old items into T-shirts, sweatshirts and shorts sporting USC colors and logos to sell back to students, visitors, alumni and fans.
The clothing line is both a business venture and a step toward sustainability — Garden stands for “gather, abundance, repurpose, demonstrate, ethos, now.”
By reusing USC athletic gear, Yoki’s Garden saves materials that would otherwise be destined for a landfill, reduces waste and conserves energy used to produce materials being made into clothing.
Although some pieces require new fabric, Yoki’s Garden tries to incorporate as much of the old materials as possible in its products, demonstrating the company’s desire to perpetuate an environmental “ethos.”
“The company deconstructs everything and turns it into something new,” Andrews said.  “Every piece has a unique and different feel to it.”
Yoki’s Garden not only helps the environment, but gives back to USC as well. Ten percent of all profits go to USC, making this partnership economically beneficial for the university as well.
The company has an innovative approach to manufacturing clothing. Although it makes the standard T-shirts and sweatshirts, Yoki’s Garden also makes products that can’t be found in the typical university bookstore.
Think of items like board shorts made out of coaches’ polos and water bottles personalized by pieces of uniforms, or what the company calls  “Fight On fingers:” cardinal and gold finger sleeves made out of old T-shirts and shorts to decorate a student’s hands on game day.
Because of the unique products and company background, Yoki’s Garden decided not to sell its items in the USC Pertusati Bookstore.
“We don’t want to get lost in all the different brands and items,” Andrews said. “It’s important that everyone who buys our products gets the whole story behind Yoki’s Garden.”
Although its apparel is currently only found online, Yoki’s Garden wants to expand its client base. This week, the company will be on campus, where employees will sell the apparel and as advertise their products on The Row.
Yoki’s Garden hopes to become a leading vendor in unique, personalized USC apparel and wants to expand the concept to other colleges. For now, Yoki’s Garden is available to students looking for a piece that has a little bit of USC history to it.
“There’s something exciting to know that the shirt you’re sporting could have a piece of Reggie Bush’s jersey in it,” Andrews said.

On Monday, Mohja Kahf reminded everyone that performance literature can be one of the most engaging forms of entertainment.
Professor of comparative literature at the University of Arkansas, author of the acclaimed novel The Girl in the Tangerine Scarf, and writer of poetry on a wide range of topics, Kahf gave a thought-provoking and educational performance of her work at Ground Zero.
Spoken word · Mohja Kahf mixed passionate readings about oppression with satirical pieces on everyday life as a Muslim woman. - Hayden Bennett | Daily Trojan
Kahf began with an ode to the surrogate mother of Moses and a piece about the hardships experienced by people under oppressive governments. Beginning with a lyrical song in Arabic, Kahf continued her poem in English and broadened its scope to current events. With passion, she voiced her disagreement with those who use their religion to justify violence and kept the audience’s attention by using strong imagery as she expressed her thoughts on the repression of speech.
After this heavy poem, which created a serious atmosphere in the room, Kahf continued with a lighter reading of four poems about Ramadan. The first referenced Ramadan in the West.
“There is no shopping ‘til dawn,” Kahf read in a poem about the differences between Ramadan and Christmas. “We do it hardcore and hungry, the old prophet way.”
Her next piece continued the sarcastic and witty tone she maintained through most of her performance. In the poem, she showed her original point of view by referencing the other “fasting” that goes on during Ramadan: sex.
She gave the poem a balance of class and humor with her eloquent descriptions of people simply not wanting to have sex paired with a playful discussion that Ramadan is “not a time for thongs.”
The following poem, “In Utero Fasting Academy,” referenced women who believe that fasting during Ramadan will harm their pregnancy. Kahf jokingly used her daughter’s good SAT scores as evidence against that idea.
Kahf’s varying rhythm and language throughout the presentation kept the audience entertained and showed her unique perspective on Islamic culture and feminism.  Her poem “Khadija Gets Her Groove Back” described the prophet Mohammad through his wife’s eyes, in a sensual, lyrical way. This description, paired with the fact that she recited the poem as though Khadija was speaking with her barber, put a humorous spin on the solemn topic of characterizing Mohammad.
When asked about reactions to her references to sexuality during the post-reading question and answer session, Kahf justified her work by relating religion back to reality.
“[Muslim women] enjoy bringing these figures to a human light,” she said. “Sensuality is part of life.”
Kahf’s insistence on audience participation stood out during her performance. In one poem she had the audience finishing her sentence “I love a man…” with “…who washes my dishes.”
This got the audience laughing throughout the poem. In a reading of the short story Girl from Mecca, she had three audience members call out “Oppression! Oppression! Oppression!” when gullible characters were fooled by a girl’s falsified story about her clichéd experience as a Muslim woman.
This story in particular echoed Kahf’s focus on the misunderstanding of Islam and Muslim women by non-Muslims. It was full of exaggerated perceptions of Muslims; Kahf succeeded in relaying the stereotypes of non-Muslims believing that all Muslim women endure suffering and oppression, while also satirizing two conservative Muslim women in her story who were appalled by the antics of a rebellious 17-year-old Muslim girl.
Kahf used cartoonish characters, sometimes exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness, to demonstrate her opinions on how Muslim women are viewed and how non-Muslims should view them.
“They are not projecting the victim,” Kahf said about Muslim women who wear hijabs or niqabs, the head coverings traditionally worn by Muslim women.
Kahf said she believes strongly in the freedom of choice of Muslim women and their right to express their religion. She drove home her support  of women who are satisfied with their identities with her excerpt from The Girl in the Tangerine Scarf. The passage focused on the beauty and significance of the scarves, without Kahf’s characteristic sarcasm and wit.
Although much of her reading was focused on her feelings about culture and race, Kahf broke away from commenting on Muslim identity to write about other issues.
When asked about her obligations to relay her views on Islamic culture to her audience, she said, “I respond to it sometimes and sometimes say, ‘Just screw it.’”

Northeast Los Angeles is a community-defining term unknown to many native Angelenos. South Los Angeles, East Los Angeles  and “the Westside” have all become common area identifiers, but Northeast Los Angeles remains an abyss in the minds of many locals even though it encompasses some of the oldest and most culturally flourishing parts of the city.
Eagle Rock, Highland Park, Mount Washington and much of the residential-based neighborhoods along the northern Interstate 110 and State Route 2 corridors claim to be a part of Northeast Los Angeles, a community separated from the city-at-large by both physical and social barriers.
Nestled in the foothills and narrow valleys where the Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains meet only 10 minutes from Downtown, NELA’s current low-key, creative-class constituency is worlds apart from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
Like many other L.A. neighborhoods forced to forge their own identity in the face of a non-encompassing city narrative, NELA has long maintained a small-town feel by supporting street fairs, community centers and cultural events that help residents engage with both their individual cities and how it relates to greater Los Angeles.
Although most of the time NELA pulls from its own resources for art walks and cultural fairs, one signature event has been slowly attracting talent from across the L.A. area — the Eagle Rock Music Festival.
Now in its 12th year, the Eagle Rock Music Festival is Los Angeles’ most underrated sonic exposé. Borne out of Eagle Rock’s much-loved Dahlia Days festival — which celebrated the town’s love of the dahlia flower with music and food in the streets — the ERMF is now an all-night street party that showcases a genre-busting swath of local musicians on three stages and 11 venues all within walking distance of one another.
Unlike other local music festivals that have envisioned a roving multi-venue experience — such as L.A. Weekly’s Detour Festival, Sunset Junction and FYF Fest — the Eagle Rock Music Festival is a completely homegrown project.
Incorporated as the ERMF by the Eagle Rock Center for the Arts’ former Executive Director Denise Seider, the first few years featured performances from the Uptown Cabaret, high school string ensembles and other NELA-based groups.
Recent help from 14th District Los Angeles City Councilman José Huizar and local businesses created enough financial stability within the festival to allow it to expand its appeal to those living outside of Northeast Los Angeles.
By never straying far from its grassroots ideals, the ERMF has increased in prominence while maintaining its community-oriented character. Every year the lineup for the free event is chosen not by a money-hungry promoter, but through an open application process.
Each of the festival’s stages is curated by a different L.A. cultural organization, which gives everyone from Low End Theory to the Women’s 20th Century Club a stake in the performances. Add this to the fact that five blocks of main drag Colorado Boulevard will be shut down to allow the attendees to take to the streets for food trucks and vendor fun, and you have a cross-generational, multicultural, end-of-summer festival.
The ERMF would be nothing were it not for the Eagle Rock Center for the Arts, a non profit as old as the festival that provides nontraditional arts education for the youth and adults of Northeast Los Angeles. Housed in a mission-style structure built in 1914, the ERMF is one of the few venues in the performance space-deprived area and as such, it hosts an eclectic array of art exhibitions, summer camps, stand-up comedy classes and, most famously, music concerts.
The 225-person room has been the site of several interesting performances in the last few years, including side project debuts from Tom Morello, Roky Erickson, Deakin of Animal Collective and José Gonzáles.
Featuring representatives from each of Los Angeles’ underground music communities, this year’s ERMF is a generous cross-section of the city’s current aural climate with stages devoted to punk, Latin, gospel, experimental, choral, zydeco, emerging, and children’s music set up in the streets and inside alternative spaces along Colorado Boulevard.
Nowhere in Los Angeles is there a music festival that is as open-minded as the ERMF. Though it has taken more than a decade to build its currently flourishing state, the welcoming atmosphere of Northeast L.A. and the community-oriented goals of the Eagle Rock Center for the Arts have created the city’s only all-encompassing musical street festival, one that has the resources and audience to place the surf-rock band The Soft Pack and psychedelic sounds of Sun Araw on the same bill with DJs Nosaj Thing and the Eagle Rock High School Latin Jazz Band.

It won the Tony Award for Best Musical probably around the time your parents were getting married. It has made more than $5.1 billion worldwide. If you have been hiding under a rock and have not seen The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway, the West End or in 23 other countries, you can see the famous play at the final stop of its national tour at the Pantages Theatre, the same theater where the tour began 20 years ago.
Photos by Joan Marcus and Cylla Von Tiedemann, courtesy of Broadway L.A.
This time, the dusty chandelier in the musical’s prologue really is a relic. As the theater comes to life, with the show’s thunderous overture and the audience’s wild applause, this tale of love and obsession shows why it still sells out in theaters everywhere it goes.
The story remains unchanged. A deformed musical genius becomes obsessed with his student, Christine Daaé, a chorus girl in the Opera Populaire. On the night of her first triumph, she reunites with Raoul, her handsome childhood friend. From there, it’s murder, madness and a dark, painful love story.
Like all of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s shows, Phantom comes loaded with camp, spectacle and melodrama. The show pokes fun at opera, has brilliant stunts such as a crashing chandelier, and has just enough Gothic romance to be forbiddingly sexy. But Phantom is a legend not just because of the gilt and glitz. There is a reason why Phantom is the longest-running musical on Broadway.
It’s the tragedy — the story of a lonely, disfigured man and his maniacal love for the only light in his life and the dark allure of swirling capes and an underground lair of music and candlelight. But such trappings come with a high dose of melodrama. It takes a skilled cast to make the audience see the human emotion behind the candelabras.
Tim Martin Gleason, who plays the Phantom, has the most complex role in the cast. He nails the Phantom’s vulnerability with cringing gestures and a childlike sadness.  However, the Phantom is also a masked loony who garrotes people for fun and keeps a life-sized Christine doll in his bedroom.
Actors who embrace the character’s darkness have the ability to make the role far more powerful and alluring. Leaving the show feeling sympathy toward this tortured soul is The Phantom of the Opera’s most compelling draw. Although Gleason does well, there has been better.
The roles of Christine and Raoul are far simpler, to the point that all they need are good actors to step up and give them life. As Christine, Trista Moldovan has a strong voice, but in situations where the character would fade into the background, so does the actress. However, she comes back stronger in the actual songs, such as the fiery “Point of No Return.”
Even if Raoul is not the character you cheer for at the end, Sean MacLaughlin takes what can be a foppish role and makes him a dashing hero — with a deep, gorgeous voice to match. He is fantastic; it’s not his fault if he out-sings the Phantom.
With all the tragic romance and dark seduction, Phantom needs a comedic balance. That is where the supporting cast comes in. Kim Stengel and Luke Grooms are hilarious as a pair of snotty opera singers — with seriously awesome vocals beneath all the satire — while D.C. Anderson and Michael McCoy are a hilarious duo as the opera’s new and frequently flabbergasted managers.
The Phantom of the Opera has never been a brilliant show from a musical standpoint — the tunes are hardly as complex as a work of Sondheim and the lyrics can often be obvious and blunt. But when the music has you humming or downloading the cast recording off iTunes, the show has done something right.
The show’s other elements are starting to reflect their age. The orchestrations, particularly the title song, have picked up more crunchy guitar work, perhaps to appeal to all the young fans drawn in by the movie.
The costumes, showcased in the kaleidoscopic splendor of the song “Masquerade,” are as lush and beautiful as ever. The foggy lake, floating candelabras and crashing chandelier are still impressive, but other effects, such as the Phantom’s fireball-shooting walking stick, don’t have the same thrill they once did. The show still has the power of its 1986 debut, but the fatigue of 20 years on the road is obvious.
Ultimately, the chandelier never quite shakes off all the dust of the prologue. After this final stop, the Phantom has earned a rest. The last performance will be Oct. 31, a fitting send-off. Fans should not see this as the end of an era, but the chance for something fresh a few years down the line. Plus, given the raging cheers at the end of the show, the fans prove the Phantom will never remain in the grave.

Our Google generation often catches a lot of unfounded flak. We’re called impatient, narcissistic, disrespectful, self-involved and noticeably lacking in empathy. Now the Association of American Colleges and Universities seeks to parry some of the criticism heaped upon us and instead admonish higher education for failing its students.
But as much as we’d like them to be right, their defense is — this time — misdirected.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
On Sept. 16, AAC&U released a study on how students accept perspectives different from their own in a report entitled “Engaging Diverse Viewpoints: What Is the Campus Climate for Perspective-Taking?” The survey included more than 24,000 students and 9,000 campus professionals across the United States. Follow-up research examined the disparity between the perceived need for engaging — not merely allowing — differences and the campus reality.
According to the report, 58.4 percent of students and 77.3 percent of campus professionals “strongly agreed that … [recognizing] the importance of taking the perspectives of others seriously should be a major focus of their campuses.” Only 32.5 percent of students “strongly agreed that their institutions currently made perspective-taking a major focus.”
The final conclusion disparages universities for not providing key opportunities to guide students toward more open-minded perspectives. However, the study did not mention the problem of student motivation.
USC spoils us with a grand array of cocurricular options specifically intended to evoke probing, open-ended questions. I sat in on a Sept. 21 event from The College Common’s Uncommon Conversations series on “Rethinking the Human.” Titled “What Is It Like To Be a Bat?,” the event, hosted by the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, proved to be a fascinating interdisciplinary venture into whether people can understand what it is like to be an animal.
If you happened to miss that one, don’t worry; a whole battalion is lined up in the coming year. But sadly, only 30 or so people were present, many of whom were not students.
Even though USC hosts a constant stream of creative events, it doesn’t always feel that way.
Students tend to naturally cluster in homogenous groups, safe within our bubbles of comfort and familiarity. We sign up to try 20 new activities, but end up funneling into organizations similar to our preexisting interests.
In fact, in the study, more than 40 percent of respondents “strongly agreed” that faculty and classes promoted the “importance of considering diverse intellectual viewpoints … and new and challenging ideas or perspectives.” Conversely, just more than one-third strongly agreed that students “advocate the need for other students to respect perspectives different from their own.”
We need to push ourselves to escape our individualistic tunnel vision. Why don’t we make more diverse friends, talk to our professors during office hours, participate in more community service or experiment more with new ideas?  It’s time to expand our horizons.
Hopefully when the next speaker comes for the Global Health Lecture Series, the What Matters to Me and Why series, the Annenberg Research Seminar series or the tens of others, the venues will be standing-room only.
But it’s ultimately up to students to attend. USC delivers a deliciously diverse range of ideas on silver platters. All we need to do is pick them up, quietly mull them over and savor them slowly.
Mark your calendars.

Thank you, I’m glad you wrote this!
The accompanying cartoon basically says it all. I get Visions & Voices updates, guest library speakers, other guests affiliated with clubs… and on the rare occasion I manage to break my routine and go attend one, I’m one of very few kids at the events. Given the size of our student body, I’m always a bit surprised at this. While getting a liberal arts degree doesn’t exactly guarantee my employment, the perspective I’ve gained at school here has been well worth it, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world. USC has made these opportunities available, and as my senior year speeds by I wish I’d been more engaged in the university community for the past three.
Hell, I’ve still got a semester and a half.

Political realism’s fundamental assumption is that self-interest trumps all. Academic studies done from this perspective assume that those who weigh all options will choose the one that gives them the maximum benefit at minimum cost.
However, many of today’s most heated political debates often reveal the fallacy of this assumption.
Alissa Masutani
Whether regarding healthcare, deficit spending or entitlement benefits, Americans today seem inclined not only to ignore their own best interests, but to actually support politicians who actively work against them.
Take the issue of entitlement benefits. If self-interest was the most powerful factor, older voters would worry more about ensuring the continuation and expansion of entitlement benefits than about deficit spending. By contrast, younger voters would be most worried about deficit spending, as they are the ones who will eventually have to foot the bill.
Logically, this should mean that older voters should lean Democratic, as that party continues to support deficit spending in order to maintain current benefits. Younger voters should subsequently affiliate with the Republican party, which is much more vocal about long-term debt issues and boasts many politicians willing to make radical changes to programs like Social Security and Medicare.
According to the Pew Research Center, however, the opposite is true.
Since 2008, the average age of Republicans has been higher than that of Democrats. Very young voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, while very old voters are overwhelmingly Republican.
The voting population’s political interests, it seems, are no longer rigidly governed by self-interest.
The most prominent example in today’s headlines of this phenomenon are the expiring tax cuts implemented by former President George W. Bush. A recent CNBC poll shows that most people  — 56 percent — believe the Obama administration’s economic policies have helped Wall Street, while only 14 percent of Americans feel that they have been helped by those policies in any way. Furthermore, 55 percent of voters are worried that the current administration’s economic plan has made things worse by raising the deficit.
Yet, the same poll shows a majority of respondents want the Bush tax cuts to be extended, even those that apply to the richest two percent of Americans. Incredibly, the same people who are angry about policies that contribute to the deficit and help the rich at the expense of the masses want to avoid taxing the rich to pay for redistribution of income — a clear violation of the principle of self-interest.
Several conclusions can be drawn from this pattern, the implications of which are certainly up for debate.
First, Americans are unable to diagnose how their own self-interests are expressed politically. People are not educated enough to be able to connect their desired consequences from government action with the policy proposals that would produce them; therefore, they often unknowingly support ideas that would work against themselves.
A second, more optimistic, theory is that Americans are not in fact self-interested. Morals and principles trump narrow economic interests, leading people to support politicians that realists would predict they would oppose.
Finally, it’s always possible that this new trend exists solely because Americans are often misled by their leaders, who convince them that certain policies will work to their benefit even when the opposite is true.
Call me a skeptic, but I am inclined to believe that theory No. 2 is only peripherally relevant. The United States might be a country that has frequently served as the world’s moral compass, but a majority in polls still calls the economy its main political concern.
Instead, the most important cause of this phenomenon is theory three, which is of course made possible by realist theory.
Americans are generally unable to stay educated enough about current issues to make informed, independent decisions. In a way, this is a good thing — if everyone had enough time to study every issue in depth, nothing else would get done.
Instead, busy people are forced to choose who they trust and follow that person’s lead. Frequently, that decision is made based on who agrees with someone’s position on the one issue of most importance to them; for example, people who are passionate about a contentious social issue like gay rights will be attracted to politicians, commentators and analysts who share their views in that area. They will then be predisposed to believe what that person says about issues that might be completely unrelated, such as tax cuts or healthcare.
Unfortunately, these opinion leaders are leading their followers astray. Frequently holding more extreme views than the generally moderate American public, figures like Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin and Keith Olbermann take advantage of their audience’s trust in order to misrepresent issues and skew perceptions.
Perhaps the conclusion that can be drawn, then, is not that self-interest is a non-factor in Americans’ policy stances, but that opinion leaders’ ability to pursue their own interests more vigorously than the busy general public is skew the discourse and harm the common goals that most people share.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in  international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Wednesdays.
I love the way he throws Keith Olbermann into the mix every time. “See? I’m objective!” Yeah. That’s why your example of “stupid misled voters” involved the Bush tax cuts, which you are apparently too uneducated to understand. Did it occur to you that perhaps the “self-interest” of the voter and the best interests of the country might BOTH be served by the Bush tax cuts? That what you and the Left insist on trying to characterize as “handouts to the rich” (which is entirely disingenuous, since it’s THEIR MONEY THEY EARNED) is actually money that helps to fund business and thus jobs? 
I agree that many working people are being misled by the Democrats, and more specifically, by their labor unions — unions which work against the interests of their own “common workingman” members, and instead work to promote the interests and power of those running the unions. This is a far better example, young Daniel, of situations in which a voter may go with someone he thinks he can trust.
I know current events are complicated, Daniel, but it doesn’t really take that much time to understand the basics. Perhaps you would support some type of “knowledge test” before people voted. You know, some way to make sure they’re as educated as they should be. LOL
You forgot theory number four: that boy wonder Daniel Charnoff may NOT be the omniscient oracle we believe him to be. Perhaps his diagnosis of what’s in our “best interests” is not, in fact, based on the ability to see all possible consequences of political developments three generations into the future. Perhaps he should learn a thing or two about the world, instead of getting his political views from Comedy Central and then repeating them here. Maybe instead of playing “let’s psychoanalyze the people who disagree with me”, he should ask them why they believe what they do.

Tonight’s hour-long debate between Democratic candidate Jerry Brown and Republican candidate Meg Whitman will start at 6:00 p.m. and take place at the Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of the University of California, Davis.
5:58 p.m. The debate is just about to start on the UC-Davis campus, and the Los Angeles Times is reporting that various student groups are protesting in front of the Mondavi Center where the debate will be held.
6 p.m. Meg Whitman was thrown the first question of the round from Amy Riggs of the Sacramento Bee, who asked the former eBay CEO what she would say to those who think California can’t be fixed. Whitman says we have to get Californians back to work to lower the 12.4 percent unemployment rate — the third-highest in the country, she says — through tax cuts and eliminating red tape. California also needs to lessen government costs and streamline it’s process. Finally, “we also have to attack welfare. California has become a welfare state.”
6:04 p.m. Now to Brown, who’s talking about the budget. “It’s never been this late before,” he says. “The budget mess is one of the key characteristics of how screwed up things are in Sacramento.” California needs to “live within its means,” Brown says. If elected, Brown says he would start by example and cut “15 to 20 percent out of the governor’s office,” then move to the legislature and the agencies. Brown’s pointing to his experience, saying he’s “done eight budgets,” and “knows how to do it.”
6:06 p.m. Whitman replies by saying that Brown will bring everyone together if he’s elected, but to help out those who helped fund his campaign.
6:07 p.m. Brown replies by referencing a “TV ad he’s seen ad nauseum” and that he doesn’t want to benefit the “millionaires and billionaires.”
6:08 p.m. Kevin Riggs of KCRA 3 Sacramento, asked Brown about the state death penalty. Brown said he would uphold the state’s laws, but do it with compassion.
“I will be a tough on crime governor,” Whitman replies. “I support the death penalty.” She points out differences between her and Brown, saying he has a “40-year record of being liberal.”
6:14 p.m. Marianne Russ of California Public Radio, the final member of the panel, is asking Meg Whitman about jobs. She asks Whitman for “real specifics” on how she could create jobs. “This is one of my biggest priorities,” Whitman says, adding that she could add 2 million private-sector jobs by  2015. Targeted tax cuts, including eliminating a factory tax and start-up tax and streamlining regulation that “strangles” small businesses, are key, Whitman said. She also says developing an economic development team is key to boosting the state’s economy.
6:16 p.m. Brown says he would create jobs “quite differently” that Whitman, who Brown says would follow the “George Bush playbook.” Brown is talking about Californians living in poverty, who he says deserve attention. Brown’s plan, he says, is to invest in clean energy — “the green tech of the future.” Brown says he will stand firm on AB32, not suspend it like Whitman wants to, so California can become a leader in green energy. Brown points out that when he was governor, California was the leader in green energy, and points out other things he did as Oakland’s mayor, where he says he cut a lot of red tape.
Brown is now talking about other areas of the economy, after prompting from Russ. Retrofitting outdated buildings is an example of where additional jobs could be found, Brown said. Finding new jobs is key.
Whitman responds by saying only 3 percent of jobs come from green jobs, and she wants to make sure the other 97 percent of jobs aren’t lost by outsourcing work to other states. She’s mentioning taxes and red tape again, and how it can challenge business growth.
6:19 p.m. Brown has been asked about his pension plan, and responded by saying if other public servants “stuck around until they were 72,” they’d get the amount of pension he would draw. In fact, he said, if he’s elected, he wouldn’t collect until he was 76 — and if he was re-elected, not until four years later. Calling himself the “best pension investment,” Brown’s comments drew laughter from the crowd. Still, Brown says there needs to be a salary commission to “stop the excess,” which he would do if elected.
6:21 p.m. Whitman has also been asked about her goals to trim public pension, and she says retirement ages need to be raised for public servants  — from 55 to 65 — among other things to reduce the burden on taxpayers. “This will not be easy,” Whitman says. “The next governor of California needs to have a spine of steel.”
To settle this with union leaders, Whitman says, negotiation is key. Second, a ballot initiative might be necessary for the people of California to “take back control of their government.”
6:24 p.m. Brown strikes back, saying the situation is one where the “kettle is calling the pot black” in terms of her fundraising tactics.
6:25 p.m. Riggs is asking Whitman about her erractic voting record and whether or not that
“First of all, I am not proud of my voting record,” Whitman says. “But what I can do is tell voters how to turn this state around.” She quotes Einstein’s definition of insanity, saying it’s doing the same thing over and over again. This has to stop in Sacramento, she says. She has the ability to be independent in Sacramento and not be beholden to special interests, which will benefit her as governor, Whitman says.
Brown is asked why this time he could do more as governor. “Age,” he cracks, to the audience’s joy. Brown also says he won’t “try to close down the bars in Sacramento” like he used to, because he now has a wife. He’s in for the duration, he says.
Brown throws the insanity quote back to Whitman, saying Schwarzenegger was from the private sector and that didn’t help the state much. “You need the know-how,” Brown says. “I’ve lived in the state all my life, I love it … I love it, I’m going to make it work … and I think I can get it back on track,” Brown said.
6:29 p.m. On Whitman’s comments about the state’s old surplus, Brown asks where it came from. “The tooth fairy? I created that damn thing,” Brown says.
6:30 p.m. Brown, a child of the University of California system, said he’s dedicated to supporting the school system. “I care about the university, I try to hold down the fees as best I can, but we’re in a tough time and we’re all going to have to sacrifice,” Brown says. He said he would do his best to prevent future fee hikes, and will encourage other state organizations to tighten their belts before cutting further into the UC system.
Whitman is now talking about the budget woes facing the UC system. “It breaks my heart,” she says. Her plan for the UC and CSU systems, she says, is to reduce costs and take $1 billion back to the UC system. This can be done by streamlining government back to the size it was five years ago, reforming pension and welfare programs. She mentions jobs again, saying welfare “can’t become a way of life.” Finally, the government has to be run more efficiently, looking to the models in Silicon Valley for examples.
She said she would give the $1 billion to the UC chancellors, and ask them the best way to use the money.
6:34 p.m. Whitman is now being asked about her campaign tactics, and whether or not voters can trust her based on the “distortion” that has been alleged against her ads. Whitman has brought up the now-infamous commercial which used former clips of former President Bill Clinton. “I stand by the ad,” Whitman says, adding that Brown doesn’t like it because it’s true. She’s going back to her main talking points — education, welfare, unions. “I stand by the ads,” Whitman says.
Brown is not being questioned about his ad where Whitman is depicted as Pinocchio. “It’s a hell of an ad,” Brown says, and the audience laughs. He’s talking about how he expanded the charter school system during his latest stint as governor and as mayor of Oakland.
Whitman is now talking about the Brown ads again, and Brown’s support of Proposition 13. “But you know what drives me crazy about career politicians?” Whitman asks. “They refuse to take responsibility.” Brown ran as a education-governor, but didn’t follow through. If elected, Whitman says she will be accountable — like all government officials should.
6:39 p.m. Immigration is now the topic of conversation, and Brown says he supports legalization as part of a comprehensive federal reform bill. Securing the borders, getting a verifiable electronic identification system are key, Brown says, but ultimately there has to be some process for finding a path to citizenship. Other notable leaders, including Kennedy, have looked at this, Brown says. Still, Brown says, criminals could be subject to deportation. Criminals should be deported, Brown says, but there should be a system for legalization for those who follow U.S. laws.
Whitman says she doesn’t support the path to legalization. “We have got to get our arms around what is a very, very pressing problem,” Whitman says. This starts by securing the border, Whitman says, and employers must be held accountable in only hiring documented workers. Sanctuary cities must also be eliminated, and temporary guest worker programs need to be strengthened for areas like agriculture, Whitman says.
When asked how she would pay for workplace inspections given California’s already tedious budget, Whitman says the long-term costs associated with illegal immigration would outweigh the costs. Illegal immigrants come to the U.S. for jobs, and the state must get to the root of the issue.
6:44 p.m. Meg Whitman is now being asked about campaign finance, and the national record she broke in terms of self-funding her campaign. “I don’t think you can buy an election,” Whitman says, before again pointing out her three main talking points — jobs, streamlining government and education. She’s now talking about fundamentally changing how the state is run and that investing her own money allows her to be independent in solving California’s problems.
6:46 p.m. Brown is asked about his “long-standing ties to labor in the state,” and how he could remain neutral if elected. Brown says he’s taken a “legendary,” “no-nonsense approach” to pay. Unions might have their problems, Brown says, but so does business, which is plagued with “fraud and abuse.” He’s talking now about the national economic problems caused by an abuse of power of those on Wall Street. He’s alleging that the Chamber of Commerce is giving Whitman money to attack his campaign, and asked for full disclosure of the funds.
Whitman says she’s amazed by the fact that Brown is trying to distance himself from the labor unions that he’s been “joined at the hip with 40 years.” It would be like “putting Count Dracula in charge of the blood bank,” if Brown were elected, Whitman says, drawing her first laughs from the audience. She’s now going back to government efficiency and reducing fraud.
6:51 p.m. Amy Chance from the Sacramento Bee has the last question of the evening, and it’s about water usage. She asks Brown if he would support sending water to Southern California from the northern part of the state. Brown says he will support water efficiency and anything that might help it. Negotiation and bringing in all parties will be key, Brown says, adding that his plan is for any region who benefits from getting the water to pay those who provide it. Safe water, water conservation, beneficiary pays and taxpayer support are other elements of his plan.
“Turning our backs on water is turning our backs on jobs,” Whitman says. Water bonds might not always be perfect — she points to an earlier one that failed — but sometimes doing something that isn’t perfect does mean getting things done, she says. “We have a humanitarian crisis going on in the Central Valley,” she says, adding that she would support conservation in Northern California.
6:55 p.m. Closing statements are now being made, and Whitman’s up first.
“I refuse to believe this state, our beautiful state, can’t be better than it is,” she says. She wants to restore the faith Californians have in their government and prove to the people that the state can be improved. “I can do that,” she says, adding that if citizens unite, “we can make the Golden State golden again.”
Brown: “To tell you the truth, I did think long and hard about whether I should run for governor again,” he says, pointing out the difference between his experience and Whitman’s. “I’ve got the know-how, I’ve got the experience and at this point in my life, I have more insight and independence,” he says.
That concludes the first of three California gubernatorial debates. For more coverage, check the Daily Trojan’s Wednesday print edition.

For those who have grown weary of organic guitar outfits like Phoenix and Vampire Weekend dominating the L.A. concert scene as of late, October shall bring the rains that Toto once cried for.
This gathering storm of electric talent will break on Thursday night, with the Francophile dream Ooh La La Festival bringing several spicy names to the El Rey.  Headlining the bill is the weirdly loveable Sebastien Tellier, who will perform an acoustic set and hopefully bring the Serge Gainsbourg vibes that oozed from his 2008 LP, Sexuality. Testarossa Autodrive maker Kavinsky will provide support with a thumping DJ set somewhere between Daft Punk and Def Leppard.
Don’t even think of trying to recover the next day. Friday night will see Neon Indian showcasing its dizzying masterwork Psychic Chasms at The Fonda, an event anyone who has ever noodled around on a Juno-60 would be ill advised to pass up. For those still wanting more, the thunderous Vitalic will bring his psychedelic show to the El Rey on Saturday night, a rare U.S. stop to promote his latest album, Flashmob – fine competition for The Bloody Beetroots’ recent house-metal movement.
James Murphy will make a final stop in town on Oct. 15 at the Hollywood Bowl with fellow Pitchfork darlings Hot Chip. Anyone who caught these two juggernauts at Coachella will have some idea of what analog magic to expect, and those lucky, unknowing souls would best pack Gatorade and a towel for the end of what has been a great summer for dance music at the bowl.
Finally, the 2010 edition of Hard Haunted Mansion, a two-night event, will bring an impressive roster of names to The Shrine on Halloween. Notable grabs are French house grandfather Mr. Oizo and the aforementioned Beetroots — who will perform their new Death Crew 77 live show, but the roster belongs to Underworld, the U.K. duo that has crafted some of the most passionate, impacting dance music made since the late 1980s and remains of the most important names in the creation and evolution of the genre.
Those still not satisfied come Nov. 4 can look forward to the soothing, orchestral compositions of Ryuichi Sakamoto at the El Rey.

A study published by in the Monday edition of Annals of Medicine found that celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder, can actually arise later in life. The study found the disease to have almost doubled among a group of 3,511 healthy adults between 1974 and 1989.
“We were shocked,” Dr. Alessio Fasano told the Los Angeles Times.
Fasano is the pediatrician who led the study at the Center for Celiac Research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.
Although doctors had believed the disease developed during childhood in response to initial exposure to gluten, researchers and doctors now do not know exactly what causes the disease.
However, Fasano said that environmental factors could trigger changes in the immune system, which could activate anti-gluten genes.
“A lot of those rules of thumb have to be re-evaluated as we learn more about it and we find patients developing the disease later in life,” Dr. Eric Esrailian, a gastroenterologist at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine, told the Times.

After being suspended for the first game of the season against Hawai’i, freshman running back Dillon Baxter, whom Lane Kiffin once referred to as “potentially our best player” is preparing to be unleashed against the unranked Washington Huskies this weekend.
“I feel like I’m getting in a little groove and starting to get used to things, the whole difference in speed,” Baxter said.
Baxter, who played quarterback, running back and receiver at Mission Bay High School in San Diego accounted for 79 touchdowns in his senior year and was touted as an instant playmaker upon enrolling at USC this spring — highlighted by his 50-yard, stop-on-a-dime touchdown run in his first scrimmage that generated more than 1.8 million YouTube views.
Washington coach Steve Sarkisian is preparing for the possibility of the Wildcat offense being utilized by the Trojans on Saturday with Baxter at the helm.
“We’ve got to continually be prepared for the unexpected,” Sarkisian said. “They ran a lot of the Wildcat stuff when he was down there [in high school].”
Against Washington State, the Trojan offense sprang to life by using fullback Stanley Havili both in the backfield and as a receiver, a trend the Trojans look to continue by getting Baxter more involved in the running and passing game.

For the last nine years, the Crosstown Gauntlet trophy has been awarded to the winner of the 19-sport head-to-head competition between USC and UCLA held each school year.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan 
The set-up is simple: Points are awarded to either school after a victory against the other in any of the sports in which the two face off. The Gauntlet is given to the first side to gain 57.5 points — just enough to ensure the majority of the total 114 points awarded.
The number of points awarded depends on the sport being played; a victory in football adds 10 points to the school’s total, while wins in men’s basketball, women’s basketball and women’s volleyball all have 10 cumulative points at stake during the course of the season. All other sports play for a total of five points each.
As has been the story for the previous three years in which USC has won the Gauntlet, the early stages of the 2010 competition have been good for the Trojans, who have taken a 7.5-to-zero lead against UCLA after two matches.
On Sept. 19, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team eked out an 11-10 victory against No. 2 UCLA in Berkeley, Calif., which, along with a share of Gauntlet points, secured the NorCal Tournament title for the Trojans.
The team got the opportunity to face UCLA in the championship match by eliminating No. 1 California 12-11 in the semifinal round. In the rematch of the 2009 NCAA national championship, the Trojans held off a furious Bruin rally in the fourth period to capture the tournament title.
In addition, the No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team beat the No. 11 Bruins last Friday at the Galen Center to open its conference season. The 3-1 victory broke a three-match losing streak to the Bruins and improved USC’s record to 12-0.
In the history of the competition, USC has won six Gauntlets to UCLA’s three. After the Trojans won the inaugural award in 2001, the Gauntlet has switched hands every year until USC managed to string together three straight victories.
The Trojans claimed the Gauntlet victory for the past year on May 1, with wins from the men’s and women’s track and field teams as well as women’s rowing team to contribute 65 points to the total.
The all-sports competition was previously sponsored by Lexus until the car manufacturer’s contract expired last year.
The search for a sponsor continued, but the schools could not find a suitable replacement; instead, the school’s athletic departments keep the official counts.
The next match-up with points at stake will occur at the women’s soccer match on Oct. 22 at the Coliseum.

Repavement on The Row began Monday morning in order to make 28th Street safer and more aesthetically pleasing, said Logan Lachman, an Undergraduate Student Government Greek senator who worked with the City of Los Angeles to initiate construction.
Pave the way · It will take about four weeks to repave 28th Street, according to Undergraduate Student Government officials. - Nathaniel Gonzales | Daily Trojan
“The Row was really bad — there were a bunch of potholes,” Lachman said. “To have that many potholes, people were tripping and falling.”
Construction workers, funded by the city, will repave 28th Street between Hoover and Figueroa streets and then will begin reconstructing the sidewalks if time permits, Lachman said. The process is scheduled to take four weeks.
Crews will be working from 6:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, during which time cars cannot be parked on the section of the road where workers are repaving.
Some students who often travel on The Row agreed that the rough road needed improvement.
“I know people were agreeing that [the road] was just kind of obnoxious,” said Lindsey Howie, a senior majoring in communication. “I think it will just make things a lot easier just with parking, biking and walking on The Row.”
Howie said, however, that she wished an e-mail or some form of communication was sent out to notify residents on The Row of the construction.
“They probably should have communicated it a little better and let people know that they are going to be shutting part of The Row down,” Howie said.
Lachman said repaving the road was for safety concerns as well as aesthetic reasons.
USG has attempted to improve The Row for years, Lachman said, though past senators have not been successful.  USG made a push last year to completely close The Row off to vehicle traffic, but that did not come to fruition.
“This has been around for a few years,” Lachman said.
Yet, some students said they believe the sidewalks on The Row need more immediate attention than the road.
“I do think that it’s good that they’re paving,” said Stacy Jones, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering. “[But] the sidewalks were a bigger issue than the streets and the potholes … Girls talk about the sidewalks as they go out to The Row, they don’t want to trip.”
This is an overall good article and I guess if you live on the row it’s important to know that this is going on, but was it really worth being on the front page of the Daily Trojan? I didn’t think the elimination of potholes was considered breaking news. I’m sure the girls mentioned in the article are in a complete panic at the thought of tripping as they walk down the street, but to anyone else, I didn’t think this warranted too much attention.
Haha I like the quote “though past senators have not been successful”.
Progress: no the row doesn’t get repaved every summer.  I don’t know how long it has been but I’m guessing a decade or more since the row was done.  
Dan: Thats why it was so frustrating when 2 years ago they repaved hoover, university, severance, portland – basically every street BUT the row.  Some people speculated it was intentional…
It’s been quite awhile since the street was repaved.  Due to City budget cutbacks and service reductions, the cycle to repave streets can literally be counted in decades.  This process was expedited thanks to a letter submitted by the presidents of the Interfraternity Parents Council (IFPC) last year to Bernard Parks, who represents the area on the City Council.
hey when does yogurtland open?  15 minutes ago, got it!!
They definitely do not repave the row every summer.  It’s on the same schedule as any other LA side street with it’s level of traffic.  The Row receives no special treatment from the city nor should it.
Is this really news? Don’t they repave the row every summer?
How about some real progress, like turning it into a cul-de-sac and cutting out the unnecessary and congesting local traffic?

At Friday’s fourth-annual conference on body computing at USC’s Town & Gown, moderator Dr. Leslie Saxon introduced  the first “body computing” center is now open at the Keck School of Medicine.
Body computing is an interdisciplinary field that uses a cell phone, heart rate monitor, doctor and computer to track a patient’s vitals and alert people through technology.
“It’s about design, it’s about telling a story,” Saxon said. “It’s about getting healthcare in the hands of consumers and making it work.”
The USC Center for Body Computing plans to focus on preventative healthcare, medical device designs and strengthening the physician-patient relationship.
“A paradigm shift is underway, which will have many consequences for the delivery of healthcare,” the center’s website said.
Saxon and executives of technology companies spoke to a crowd of more than 200 doctors, engineers, bankers and gamers about using wireless devices such as cell phones to transport medical information.
Kian Saneii, CEO of Independa, a San Diego startup that creates technology to help caregivers, gave his definition of body computing.
“You don’t have to be a computer geek,” Saneii said. “It’s the intersection of the human being and technology … talking about your health and body.”
Keynote speaker Dr. Joel Selanikio detailed his program EpiSurveyor, a global data system that tracked supplies during the Haitian earthquake, drug vaccines in West Africa and tsunami relief efforts in Indonesia.
“Through mobile phones, even a phone with a simple text message capability, every single clinician in the world can consult with colleagues around the world,” he said.
Other programs mentioned at the conference include “wiihab,”  a virtual rehabilitative program through the Wii video game system that helps soldiers before combat or those suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.
“Healthcare is really the only industry which the Internet hasn’t caught up with,” Saneii said. “This conference is really the catalyst that brings technologies to bear.”
Even members from the sports world came out to the conference to discuss the importance of body computing to their field.
Lee Bushkell, vice president for the Professional Golf Association website, tested a correlation between golfers’ heart rates and their putting accuracy.
Attendees of the event said the conference provided a snapshot of technology’s future.
“It’s interesting listening to all the people and innovative ideas,” said Chalan Koneru, an engineer at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. “The [question is] how do we keep the physician still in control but make the patient feel more comfortable?”
Another example of such context is KNOWME Networks, an organization that works to reduce childhood obesity through technology. Researchers send a text message or call a participant’s phone if low activity levels are recorded.
“The recipe is meaning plus entertainment plus seamless equals mass adoption,” said Dr. Steven LeBoeuf, CEO of Valencell, a company that builds technology for fitness.

Going to college was something that Yvette Sanchez never considered. It wasn’t until she reached fifth grade that she and her parents discovered USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative, and the idea of college became a possibility.
“I remember being a little kid, and I never really thought about college, never really knew about college,” said Sanchez, a junior majoring in psychology. “It wasn’t until I started NAI and they told us that there is much more that you can do.”
USC established NAI as a college preparatory program for low-income minority students living in the area surrounding campus. Students who complete the program with good standing and meet all requirements for admission to USC are eligible for a full four and a half-year financial aid package.
“Being from [South Los Angeles], you’re not expected to do much. They think that we can’t make it or that we’re not smart enough or that we don’t have the resources,” Sanchez said. “[It’s an accomplishment] being able to prove that wrong, showing that we can do something.”
The average college attendance rate of NAI scholars is 99 percent, and more than 35 percent of NAI scholars have attended or are attending USC.
According to Kim Thomas-Barrios, executive director of NAI, there are currently about 500 students in the program and more than 80 NAI graduates attending USC.
“NAI offers its students, grades seven through 12, a wide array of enhanced educational experiences designed to create a college-bound mindset and a holistic preparedness for academic success,” Barrios said in an e-mail.
The six-year program, which first accepted students in 1991, prepares students for college beginning in seventh grade. Students and parents apply for the program when the student is in sixth grade. Acceptance is not necessarily merit based, although there are certain grade criteria that applicants must meet in order to be eligible, Barrios said.
“The Neighborhood Academic Initiative is not a gifted program. It seeks to reach local, underserved, inner-city students who display the desire and determination to attend college,” Barrios said.
In order to prepare for college, the students are exposed to a rigorous curriculum, hands-on instruction and high expectations regarding both academic and personal conduct, Barrios said.
In high school, students attend morning classes for math and English on USC’s campus, and are then bused back to their high schools to finish the remainder of the school day. Students also go to class on Saturdays on USC’s campus to discuss what they’ve learned that week.
“I think it’s a good opportunity for kids of our community to experience college, and it takes you on a different road for a better future,” said Amarilis Bolanos, a junior majoring in Spanish and graduate of NAI.
Despite the rigorous curriculum, Bolanos said the workload was manageable and viewed school as a challenge she enjoyed.
“I think that if I had been in the regular classes with the regular kids I wouldn’t have been so competitive,” Bolanos said. “I wouldn’t have thought about going to college as much. I would’ve still thought about it, but it wouldn’t have been so intense.”
NAI not only emphasizes commitment from students in the classroom but also commitment from parents. When the program was first developed, organizers decided that parents would be required to actively participate in the educational process since research has proven that students perform better academically when their parents are involved. Parents are required to go to seminars held by the NAI Family Development Institute.
“People from NAI would inform us more and tell us what to do for prepping for college,” Sanchez said. “NAI did a really great job in telling us [how to prepare]. I think it definitely pushed me for something.”
Barrios said the goals of the program are to help students get accepted to college as well as ensure success upon graduation so they can lead an enriched life.
NAI is looking to enlarge the program to include more students from the neighborhoods surrounding campus and make the program more effective.
“If it wasn’t for the program, then I wouldn’t be here at USC,” Bolanos said. “I’m really glad the program is there — hopefully it brings more kids in.”
The true value of any program is its measurable success rate. NAI has demonstrated that it is worthy of becoming a national model for all universities in the U.S. Excellent example of “walking the walk,” not just talk like so many other so-called “reform” programs, e.g., NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND.
Wow, what a great article! I had never heard of this program before, but the reporting is absolutely top notch and the quotations really gives us readers a personal view into the lives of the students in the program.

President Barack Obama hosted a conference call for student journalists Monday morning, where he discussed higher education and answered questions from students about the upcoming future for graduates.
“I’ve been talking about this a lot lately. We have fallen behind,” Obama said. “In a single generation, we’ve fallen from first to 12th in college graduation rates.”
Call of duty - President Obama said students should be just as active in the midterm elections as they were during the presidential elections. - Photo courtesy of the White House Media Affairs Office
The Daily Trojan participated in the phone call along with other student journalists from universities across the nation.
Obama began the call by outlining the financial aid efforts his administration has made to make college more affordable.
These include increased Pell Grants, loan forgiveness, federal loan directions, college tax credits and the healthcare reform.
“The single most important step we can take is to make sure that every young person gets the best education possible,” Obama said. “What I’ve done, starting with this past year’s State of the Union address, is proposed that by 2020, we once again are No. 1.”
During the call, the president also emphasized the need for college completion and the recent failure of the Dream Act, which would have allowed undocumented young adults who have lived in the United States for more than five years and arrived before they were 16 to gain citizenship after two years in a university or the military.
One of his main goals, he said, was to ensure that higher education was accessible to  everyone, despite the inflating cost of tuition. According to Obama, higher education inflation is currently increasing at a faster rate than healthcare cost inflation.
“The key here is that we want to open the doors of our colleges and universities,” Obama said.
Obama also said Vice President Joe Biden plans to hold a summit next week on community colleges.
“Part of what I think we’ve got to examine is [if we are] designing our universities in a way that focuses on the primary thing, which is education,” Obama said. “There should be a pie chart at every university that says, out of every dollar you spend in tuition, here’s where your money is going.”
Students were also given the opportunity to ask Obama questions during the 29-minute phone call. One of the four remarks made was concerning the job outlook for students after graduation.
“I’ve heard some of my professors call our generation the ‘lost generation’ because we’re going to get out of school with a ton of debt due to student loans and not be able to pay them off,” said Colin Daileda, a student at Radford University.
The president replied that there were still opportunities for students who tailored their education toward certain fields, such as clean energy.
“If you are getting a college degree, if you’ve got skills in math or science … there are still jobs out there even in a tough environment. Nine of 10 people who are looking for work can still find work,” he said.
With the upcoming midterm elections, Obama said it was necessary for students to get just as involved as they did during the 2008 presidential election.
“Even though this may not be as exciting as a presidential election, it’s going to make a huge difference in terms of whether we’re going to be able to move our agenda forward over the next couple of years,” he said.
To end the conference call, Obama emphasized what he saw as the great potential of the upcoming generation.
“I just want to remind people that you guys all have enormous challenges that you’re going to have to face, but you continue to live in the most vibrant, most dynamic, wealthiest nation on Earth,” the president said.

Downtown Los Angeles was hit with a staggering high of 113 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, the hottest temperature ever recorded for the area.
Hot hot heat · Students escape from the heat by sitting in the pool outside Leavey Library. The temperature reached 113 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, breaking a city record, but the high heat is expected to go down as the week progresses. - Nathaniel Gonzales | Daily Trojan 
The last record was set on June 26, 1990 with a high of 112 degrees Fahrenheit.
Forecasts show that temperatures will remain in the high 80s for the next few days but will steadily decrease throughout the week.
The university sent out a Trojans Alert advising students to stay hydrated and remain in air-conditioned buildings for the duration of the day.
Many freshmen students said they found it difficult to keep cool because the majority of the freshman, however, dorm rooms on campus are not equipped with air conditioners.
“It’s been pretty rough because I’ll try to go back to my room and it’s just unbearable being upstairs. So I’ll come down to the lobby to work, but the lobby is packed with people in every room,” said Ian Lipson, a freshman majoring in music industry who lives in Birnkrant Residential College.
To deal with the heat, students said they are also sleeping in air-conditioned lobbies at night to keep from overheating.
“There was no floor space in the [Birnkrant lobby] last night because everyone was sleeping on the floor. It feels like a big slumber party. It was ridiculous,” said Sara Carrion, a freshman majoring in international relations.
Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, recommended that students stay out of the sun as much as possible, drink water throughout the day and apply sunscreen when going outside.
In addition, he said students should reduce their alcohol intake and dress in cool, loose-fitting clothing.
The health center will be open to provide evaluations for anyone feeling faint or experiencing other symptoms related to the heat.
