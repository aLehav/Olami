After launching a Kickstarter campaign this past August, two alumni from the USC Marshall School of Business, Amir Atighehchi and Mikey Ahdoot, have created a product called Nutlock to foil potential bike thieves.
Heart wrenching · Most bicycles use hexagonal nuts to attach the wheels that can easily be removed using ordinary wrenches. – Carol Kim | Daily Trojan
The device is a specialized nut that fastens wheels to a bicycle frame that ordinary wrenches can’t loosen. The idea came to them after both founders were victims of bike theft several times. They finally were fed up when a thief stole Atighehchi’s front wheel and Ahdoot’s back wheel and bicycle frame.
“All he needed to do that was a wrench,” Ahdoot said. “That’s what got us so concerned. It’s just so easy for a thief to steal bikes and especially bike parts.”
The pair began researching for the device by closely examining bike racks. From this, they realized that the wheels were the most vulnerable parts of the bicycle. Since Nutlock would prevent the wheels from being stolen, students would then only need one U-lock to avoid carrying two locks to secure both wheels, Atighehchi said. After researching other ways to prevent bike theft, the duo drew up a provisional pattern.
Atighehchi and Ahdoot then contacted students at the Viterbi School of Engineering  to help them design the project. The idea was well received, and after generating significant interest, they chose three engineering students to work on the project.
“That’s how we met, and that’s how I got involved with the project,” said Jazzmin Martinez, one of the engineering students. Martinez started off by working on Atighehchi’s concepts as product developer. The engineers then used the software Solidworks to create sketches for the product.
“In the beginning, it was definitely a lot of sketching and prototypes and 3-D modeling to try and get these concepts out in the open so we can test them out,” Martinez said.
Atighehchi and Ahdoot brainstormed with the engineers for the design of the product as well as for developing its initial business model, a process that included surveying 100 students and getting consulting help.
“We tried to raise funding as well,” Atighehchi said. “We were doing the leg work of trying to find the best sources to help us produce the product.”
The components to the product are compact: the key is only 3.5 inches long and the nut is 0.95 inches in diameter. The nuts have special cut-outs that only the accompanying key can fit, the founders said.
In May 2012, the Nutlock project was accepted into the Accelerate, Incubate, Mentor Program at USC, a highly competitive program that gave them seed funding of $15,000.
The founders also launched a Kickstarter campaign on Aug. 6  that will last until Sept. 14. Within a span of 10 days, their campaign reached over twice its goal amount of $15,000.
Their product gained support from various types of cyclists, ranging from commuters to students to city cyclists. Donations came from people  as far as the United Kingdom and Brazil.
According to the Dept. of Public Safety, 49 bicycles were reported as stolen during the 2013-2014 school year, and 12 bicycle thefts were reported in the summer.
“I know of one [student] who said his bike was stolen twice,” said Deji Adeleke, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “He’s afraid of getting a new bike.”
Marc Cocjin, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering, said that locking a bicycle with a cable is ineffective.
“Some bikes look like you can steal them,” he said.
Certain students feel the threat of bicycle theft more than others. Christian Washington, a second-year graduate student in computer science thinks his bike is safe when locked on campus.
“If my bike was stolen, I’d be very surprised,” he said, “Especially given there [are] so many bikes.”
Even though the Nutlock start up has yet to bring its product to stores, those working on it are excited about its potential.
“I was attending a graduate-level design class taught by Professor Stephen Lu, and this project was a perfect opportunity for me to put what I learned into real life,” said Huy Tran, one of the engineers for Nutlock. “It was an exciting idea that would help fixing the bicycle theft problem, of which I was also a victim during my university years.”
The Nutlock product can be bought online via the website www.lockyournuts.com.
“As a student at USC, I lived through the pain of bike theft,” Ahdoot said. “If you’re biking on campus, your bike wheels will get stolen unless you use Nutlock.”

This summer, Dr. Jeffrey Hagen and Dr. Daniel Oh of the Keck School of Medicine of USC became the first doctors in Southern California to perform robot-assisted procedures with the new da Vinci Xi machine. Da Vinci robots, manufactured by the robotic surgical systems producer Intuitive Surgical, have been used worldwide since the Food and Drug Administration approved the first model of the machines in 2000.
According to USC News, the Keck Medical Center of USC is the only facility in the world that has a training center for da Vinci technology.
The brand new Xi model received FDA approval on April 1 of this year. It includes a simpler and more compact endoscope, an instrument that is used to look inside the body, with improved vision and clarity of image, smaller, thinner arms to allow for a greater range of motion and a longer instrument shaft for greater reach. To date, the most common procedures performed via da Vinci robots are hysterectomies (removal of the uterus) and prostatectomies (removal of the prostate). These improvements allow for more intricate applications, such as the thoracic surgery performed on a lung cancer patient by Hagen, who is chief of thoracic surgery, and Oh.
Da Vinci technology also enables surgical procedures to be performed remotely, allowing surgeons to utilize their skills from afar. Past surgeries using similar robotic technology have included a transatlantic telesurgery performed in 2001, when surgeons at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York removed the gallbladder of a 68-year-old woman in Strasbourg, France.
Robotic technologies improve operations with wristed instruments that allow for more dexterity as well as minimal incision sizes, shorter hospital stays and faster recovery periods for patients.
Though robot-assisted procedures are often compared to laparoscopic surgery, robotic procedures cost approximately $1,300 more on average per surgery than those performed with laparoscopic devices. Laparoscopic surgery utilizes small incisions typically made in a different area than the part intended for surgery.
According to Reuters Health, however, few doctors are skilled enough to perform laparoscopic surgery. Robotic surgery allows more patients to have access to minimally invasive surgery.
Hagen pointed out that robotic technology was not meant to compete with laparoscopic procedures and that robotic technology should be viewed in terms of the advantages it provides over traditional open surgery.
“As of 2012, 85 percent of prostatectomies have been performed using robotic technologies, while less than 1 percent have been performed laparoscopically,” Hagen said.
For Keck students and faculty, having the da Vinci Xi machine represents their advanced expertise. Hagen also said that the robotic surgery program at Keck is the largest in the state of California and likely in the western United States. The program offers training across a broad range of specialties and is well recognized nationwide.
 
 
If they had advanced expertise as laparoscopic surgeons, they would not need the cost of the robot, but could perform a regular laparoscopic surgery.  The solution is more surgeon training in laparoscopic techniques and the less invasive vaginal hysterectomy, not wasting money on Davinci products.   If Keck is the “only” of something, they should stop and ask why.  Surgeon “honorariums” from Intuitive surgical anyone?

For the past five years, professor of classical art and archaeology John Pollini has led a six-week field archaeology course in Italy. AHIS 325, Roman Archaeological Excavation: Methods and Practice, takes place in Ostia Antica, an ancient port city along the Tiber River.

This summer, 13 students from a variety of majors joined Pollini to excavate Ostia and explore the sites of ancient Rome and modern Italy. During their first week, the students followed a booklet of instructions that led them through sights in Rome that they had previously seen only in textbooks.
“[The Italian] perception of what is modern is so different from what modern is to us … [the year] 1700 is still modern to them,” said Stella Chung, a junior majoring in communication and political science.
Starting the second week, the students woke up at 6 a.m. each day to catch a train from their apartments in Rome to the dig site. From there, the students were split up into groups based on their interests. Many students had different experiences, but they unanimously agreed that Pollini had the answer to everything.
“He’s really funny and very approachable” said Madalina Nastase, a sophomore majoring in theatre.
When Pollini began teaching art history and classics at USC in 1987, the archaeology department did not yet exist. A childhood trip to Egypt ignited Pollini’s passion for archaeology, but he decided to pursue classics after taking Latin in high school.
Antiquity, the period preceding the Middle Ages, is Pollini’s main interest. He is particularly interested in ancient religion, mythology, narratology, rhetoric and propaganda as well as the interplay between the different fields. In 2012, he published his sixth book, From Republic to Empire: Rhetoric, Religion, and Power in the Visual Culture of Ancient Rome.
Pollini often tells students that antiquity is like looking at “a slice of Swiss cheese with a lot of holes in it.”
“Normally literary sources tend to be by the upper classes, so you’re going to get a specifically aristocratic point of view … but then the archaeological sources tell a different story, they fill in gaps that are missing. … The archaeological evidence also tells us great deal about the common people,” Pollini said.
Consequently, AHIS 325 is about balancing perspectives. Pollini leads the class to expose archaeology majors to field work. The ongoing program, supported by the nonprofit American Institute for Roman Culture, was designed for students with no excavation experience.
The possibility of finding skeletons was a major selling point for Chung, who said she signed up because she wanted to “touch dead things.” Emma Wang, a sophomore majoring in international relations who originally stumbled upon the program through a pamphlet at the Roski School of Fine Arts, helped unearth part of a human jaw and skull. She said that one of the most exciting parts was looking at the stratification in the ground.
“You see [those] layers of dirt, and that’s history right in front of us,” Wang said.
Pollini revealed that this year  the class discovered a mausoleum that was possibly reused in the Christian era to bury St. Monica, the mother of City of God author and theologian St. Augustine. The building might also have served as the final resting place of St. Aurea, a local saint. As teams in Rome continue digging, they hope to confirm the identity by next year. This year they also continued to excavate a fourth century A.D. Roman house, where they found early medieval-period fishing equipment that could have been used in commercial fishing activities.
Pollini, who is currently on sabbatical, will be working on a project dealing with late antiquity, from the fourth to seventh century A.D., on the Christian destruction and desecration of images of classic antiquity, a topic on which he has published several articles. On Oct. 29, Pollini will give a lecture on Augustan monuments at the Getty Villa as part of the 2,000th anniversary of Emperor Augustus’ death.
For the students of AHIS 325, the summer taught them skills such as how to draw plans and how to keep a journal. Chung said the dig taught her about teamwork and how to work without egos getting in the way. Wang noted the dig taught her about responsibility.
“If you make a mistake, that mistake is going to stay with the item,” Wang said, “It’s going to be passed down through history, so you know that you have a huge responsibility to document every single thing you do.”

USC Athletics and Premium Experiences are implementing new projects to enhance the game day experience for the 2014 football season. The most visible additions will be the 10 premium on-field suites that will be added along the eastern end zone. Each suite will have both shaded and non-shaded seating, high-end dining and satellite television.
“People love the experience of being down close to the action on the field,” said Steve Lopes, senior associate athletic director. “These are pretty popular around the NFL and even in college football.”
Upgrades · Classic Tents Events Specialists built new suites for the Coliseum with tickets available starting at $100, including VIP parking. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The suites are part of a trial to see if Trojan fans are interested in utilizing high-end amenities at football games. Legends, a company that specializes in hospitality and sales, will be in charge of the marketing for the premium seating. Classic Tents Event Specialists will build the suites. Tickets for the suite seating will be approximately $100 each per game and will include VIP parking. Fans can buy individual tickets instead of an entire suite, Lopes said.
The tents will be built on part of the sun deck bleachers, which was previously an overflow area for student ticket holders and a place reserved for the Trojan Marching Band.
“We’ve taken the front half of these bleachers and removed it, and we put these 10 field suites in front of them,” said Lopes. “The band and the guests of the band will be accommodated.”
Students are concerned about losing some of the seating provided by the bleachers.
“It makes me feel like USC doesn’t prioritize the students,” said Rachel Tang, a sophomore accounting major.
Others felt that being able to watch football was the most significant part of the game day experience.
“As long as [students] are able to sit there and enjoy the game, I think that’s what matters,” said Roshini Nwoko, a senior majoring in human biology. “But if it does take away from the amount of students that can sit there, I think that would be a problem.”
Despite the loss of seats, all ticket holders will be able to enjoy many other Coliseum upgrades. According to Lopes, each gate will have mobile ticketing, which allows access to football games via smart phones.
“We are trying to make it easier for our fans to come,” he said, “They can transfer a ticket to a friend or a colleague via their phone.”
An announcement on USCTrojans.com stated that the concession stands will broaden their menu to include smoked ribs, funnel cakes, pizza and fried chicken, along with gluten-free and vegetarian options. To reduce wait time at checkout, the ground level concession stands will have twice the amount of registers.  Restrooms on the ground level will receive a fresh paint job, new lighting and new fixtures.
Other changes include two new Coliseum Clubs located near gates 6 and 19 that will be open to the public until 30 minutes before kickoff, and then limited to Trojan Athletic Fund members during and after games.
Trojan TunnelVision will return for its second season and will feature more in-depth videos and analysis. The filming staff will show pre-game analysis and featurettes an hour before kickoff, interview coaches and players at halftime and show videos that will familiarize fans with players throughout the games. The webcast is available on all mobile devices and online.
The Athletic Department also said that refinements to the Coliseum distributed antenna system (DAS) will boost wireless coverage at the stadium. The press box and locker rooms will also be upgraded this season.
Improving game day parking is another goal of the Athletic Department. In the past, protocol for parking would change during the season, which frustrated some fans.
“We are working with the transportation department to make a parking plan that is efficient and consistent,” Lopes said.
In September of last year, USC negotiated a new 98-year lease for the Coliseum with the City of Los Angeles. According to a USC press release, as part of the lease agreement, USC will invest approximately $70 million in renovations and improvements prior to the centennial celebration of the Coliseum in 2021-23. Patrick Auerbach, associate senior vice president for Alumni Relations, said the Alumni Association is optimistic about the renovations.
“The Alumni Association is behind the whole Coliseum lease 100 percent because it’s in the best interest of the university and the athletics program,” Auerbach said.

What is chastity? Many believe that it is the same as abstinence, but 28-year-old Arleen Spenceley begs to differ. “Chastity never ends. Abstinence does. Chastity infuses sex with love and love with sacrifice. Abstinence doesn’t,” Spenceley said.
The Chaste Life · Arleen Spencely wants to shift the discussion on sex to encourage a lifestyle of abstinence until marriage. Spencely cites her Catholic faith as a major influence in her decision to maintain her chastity. – Photo courtesy of Arleen Spencely
In the adult nonfiction book Chastity Is For Lovers: Single, Happy, and (Still) a Virgin, Spenceley expresses her opinion that people should save sex until marriage and clarifies any misunderstandings about what she believes to be the definition of chastity. Spenceley is a faithful Catholic and a staff writer for the Pasco Times edition of the Tampa Bay Times in Florida. The book is based on an article she wrote in 2012, titled “Why I’m still a virgin at age 26,” for the Pasco Times.
“I’ve actually written two sex essays for the Times,” Spenceley said. “When I was 23, I dated a guy who was funny and fun and cute, but my decision to practice chastity confused the heck out of him.”
The relationship faced several problems as both partners tried to compromise to make things work; he agreed to abstain from sex with her but, in the end, tried many times to talk her out of saving sex for marriage. Eventually, the couple broke up, and Spenceley decided to put her love life on paper and talk about sex — or her lack of it.
“A couple of things dawned on me after the breakup: First, if an adult’s decision to practice the virtue of chastity is confusing and absurd to one person, it’s probably confusing and absurd to a lot of people. Second, I work for Florida’s largest newspaper, which means I have access to a lot of people,” Spenceley said.
Taking advantage of her position at the Times, Spenceley then asked the opinion editor if she could write about why she’s saving sex. He said yes, and it all began. Within 30 minutes the essay was posted online, people wouldn’t stop talking about it. For two years, Spenceley would receive emails full of professional and personal questions, and as a result, she sat down to write Chastity Is For Lovers.
The book has eight chapters, each separated into several smaller sections. They cover topics including dating, the difference between chastity and abstinence, what it is like to be a virgin in a culture opposed to it and the difference between love and being in love. Most of the time, sections start with a narrative or a story, usually taken from Spenceley’s personal experiences and observations. She cites stories she has read and lessons she has learned from her quest to find a suitable husband who also practices chastity.
Even though a lot of her anecdotes don’t end with a happily ever after, Spenceley’s tone remains light, and she jokes about some of the encounters she’s had.
“Life isn’t hard because [she’s] single; life is hard because [she’s] human,” she said. What makes Spenceley’s voice distinct, however, is that she does not simply give the word “chastity” a definition, she also describes it with everyday occurrences and similes, which paint more vivid images of the abstract term. Additionally, the 28-year-old virgin also provides tips throughout the book on how to practice chastity. Instead of just defining the word or narrating her story, she attempts to help those who want to practice the same lifestyle. Her purpose in saving sex until marriage is not only to discover the best way to love someone, but also to uphold the beliefs and values taught to her by her Catholicism, so she regularly refers to her religious background in her work.
Throughout the book, the author quotes other sources, such as books she’s read and people’s she met, to support her opinion. Despite her references to other people and their work, however, she always expands on the topic by including her thoughts, infusing her personal stories into the facts. Though Spenceley is also open to other’s ideas, she points out flaws in their thinking and uses their mistakes to further support her points.
Spenceley wants readers to continue to discuss chastity and sex after reading her book. She observes that people tend to stop talking about saving sex after they turn 18 and youth groups disband.
“I want the book to restart a conversation that never should have stopped,” Spenceley said. “If we stop talking about something, we imply — even if accidentally — that it isn’t relevant anymore. But chastity and sex are never not relevant.”
In addition, she hopes some of her older readers will be able to connect with her through her personal anecdotes about her way of life.
“I want the book to be an encouragement to adults who are saving sex or sex from now on for marriage. It’s easy in our culture to feel like the only one who isn’t having sex, but they aren’t alone, and I want them to know that,” Spenceley said.
As for the future, the author plans to talk more about chastity inside and outside of churches and youth groups. She wants to appeal to young adults, a demographic she feels could benefit the most from these conversations as it is the age where people begin exploring their sexuality and discovering themselves. Spenceley sees herself writing more books after this one about similar topics because of how big an effect it has on her life.
“I also like toying with the idea of going back to school for a doctorate,” the author said. “But if I do, it’ll probably be a while.”
 
Chastity Is For Lovers goes on sale on Nov. 28, and is available now for pre-order on websites.

Two shows, one night. This was the life of British band Rudimental, who performed one opening gig at the Staples Center and another headlining at the Sound Nightclub in Hollywood on Wednesday.
Keeping it basic · Trumpeter Mark Crown joined Rudimental on tour. The group was nominated for a Mercury Prize in 2013 for its debut album, Home, and its track “Feel the Love” reached No. 1 in the U.K. – Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons
First up for the band was the behemoth venue that is the Staples Center, where Rudimental kicked off the night for Ed Sheeran’s concert.
The stadium was full in the standing areas and mostly filled in the seated sections, but the audience response to Rudimental’s performance was less than robust, especially in comparison with their response to Sheeran’s songs later in the night.
The lack of response, however, wasn’t due to a lack of ability. Take, for example, that Rudimental just had a very successful summer on the festival circuit that includes V Festival, Lollapalooza and Coachella. But, because they’re still an emerging band, the crowd’s lackluster behavior most likely stemmed from the crowd’s unfamiliarity with the artist. The front section closest to the stage seemed like the only area with any life. It also didn’t help that many people were still entering when the Rudimental set started at 7:30 p.m.
Sheeran, who is known for hits such as “The A Team” and “Lego House,” is not the only artist Rudimental is touring with right now. In addition to the red haired singer-songwriter, Rudimental is also currently on tour with Black Butter Records. Los Angeles is their fourth stop in North America.
The  four-piece band is comprised of Piers Agget, Amir Amor, Kesi Dryden and Leon Rolle (DJ Locksmith), and their style of music bridges pop and underground dance music. The group formed in 2010, with strong roots in an East-London district called Hackney, an area known as a working-class, multicultural melting pot. Their debut album cover, which hung on a backdrop onstage, is a Hackney neighborhood mural chosen to commemorate their roots.
One unique thing about Rudimental is the group does not have a frontman — there is no Adam Levine or Chris Martin stealing the limelight. Instead, the four members choose to bring in different vocals for each song.
Their strategy is working. The group’s song “Feel the Love,” featuring John Newman was nominated for a BRIT Award in 2013. In 2014, their song “Waiting All Night” won in the category of British Single of the Year at the BRIT Awards, beating out artists such as Bastille, Calvin Harris, Disclosure, Ellie Goulding and One Direction.
As was the case in its music festival shows, Rudimental’s performance was vigorous and athletic at the Staples Center. During the concert, the band was joined by additional vocalists: Bridgette Amofah, Anne-Marie and Thomas Jules, who typically perform the featured parts in Rudimental songs. Punctuated by frenetic jumping, high kicks and other dramatic antics, the group powered through their hits. Amofah’s energetic singing was emphasized by the physical movements she did onstage in an eye-catching pink skirt. Trumpet player Mark Crown was also present to add texture to their performance.
Soon, Rudimental introduced and launched into their song “Free” by asking the audience if they wanted to be “free.” The track featured the vocals of Emeli Sandé, which started to energize the atmosphere. Sandé’s role was performed by vocalist Anne-Marie. Sensing the lagging audience spirit, the band also started encouraging the audience to jump and clap along. The group’s most popular song that evening was “Waiting All Night,” and some audience members sang along to it. The track originally featured Ella Eyre, but was also performed by Anne-Marie.
Even though most of the band’s set was greeted with scattered cheers and audience members with seats remained seated, Rudimental valiantly tried to increase audience participation. The artists initiated a sing-along during “Feel the Love,” their breakout track, by aggressively pushing the lyrics and even slowing down and enunciating them for the audience to remember. The band also put up their hands in a heart shape for the audience to mimic. Fun fact — later that night, Sheeran performed “Bloodstream,” a song he wrote with Rudimental.
Several hours later, the group shifted to their second performance that night at Sound Nightclub. Here the audience was more laid-back, but also more warmed-up and open to dancing. Rudimental’s performance was preceded by veteran house music producer Todd Edwards, who pioneered a technique that gave birth to the U.K. garage style of dance music, and My Nu Leng, a Bristol based duo who draw on various influences to remix songs from top U.K. artists, such as Rudimental themselves.
The band began performing around half an hour past midnight and the club’s sunken dance floor was mostly filled. Under a shiny shark-shaped disco ball, partygoers jammed along to the music. The Sound Nightclub is small and modern venue right next door to the historic Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Its decor combines a bit of industrial-cool aesthetic with some old-school touches. The elevated stage in the center of the dance floor is designed so that the act could be seen from all around the club.
Rudimental’s D.J. set at The Sound was different from what they performed at the concert. Gone were the live performers, although Crown stayed to interject trumpet solos, to which audiences reacted well. They performed “Powerless” and some more of their underground dance songs.
Rudimental will continue to tour America with Sheeran and Black Butter Records. The group will return to the United Kingdom to perform at the iTunes Festival next month and have lined up collaborations with Nile Rogers, funk legend George Clinton and Kelis.

With a win over Long Beach State and an exciting double-overtime tie with San Diego, the USC women’s soccer team has started its season off on the right foot. In fact, the team nearly pulled out the victory over San Diego, as the Women of Troy outshot the Toreros 13-6 on the game (6-2 in shots on goal), and had several opportunities that just missed or were spoiled by San Diego’s standout goalkeeper Michelle Craft. USC’s attack was lead by junior Megan Borman, who tallied six shots in the game, with four being on goal and one finding the back of the net in the first half against San Diego for the Trojans’ only goal of the game.
While a pair of wins would have been an ideal start to the season, especially considering the learning process that is necessary with a new coaching staff, there is no doubt that the team feels good about their opening two matches.
“We played really solid last weekend against two teams that are going to win a fair amount of games this season,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine. “We are obviously still growing as a team and it’s early in the season, but we are pleased with the fact that, thus far, we are undefeated.”
With opening weekend in the books, the Women of Troy will now look to continue gaining momentum this weekend as they head to South Bend, Indiana, to participate in the Notre Dame adidas Invitational. They will play two games over the course of the road trip, kicking off Friday evening against the Iowa State Cyclones. The team will then have a day off Saturday before taking on the tournament host and school rival Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who are currently ranked No. 11 in the country.
When asked of the importance of this trip, McAlpine didn’t sugarcoat his response: “We are playing two great opponents from two big conferences,” he said. “It’s going to be a good way to measure ourselves. Between the travel, the environment and the opponents, this will be a good test for us to see where we are and how we need to improve going forward.”
The first measurement will begin Friday at 5 p.m. ET against an iowa State team that has started their season with a win and a loss. In their season opener on Friday, Aug. 22, the Cyclones annihilated Mississippi State 5-1. Then, this past Sunday, they valiantly battled a fringe top-25 team in the Mississippi Rebels, losing just 1-0.
As easy as it might be for the Women of Troy to look forward to the Sunday showdown against the Fighting Irish, McAlpine was adamant that the team must not look past their game Friday.
“Iowa State is a very tough, physical, up-and-coming team,” he remarked. “Our job is to go out and perform well on Friday against them. If we do that, it will put us in the right state mentally to beat Notre Dame on Sunday.” As exciting as beating Notre Dame would be, even a draw against the Irish should be seen as a victory, especially considering that the game will be played at Notre Dame’s home field.
Thus far, the Fighting Irish are off to a predictably good start to the season, with two victories over Illinois 3-1 Friday, Aug. 22 and Oakland 3-0 last Sunday. Before the matinee showdown against our Women of Troy on Sunday, the Irish will have a tough matchup against the No. 16 Texas Tech Red Raiders on Friday night, who will be looking to upset host Notre Dame and surpass them in the national rankings.
As for how the Trojans stack up against the Irish, McAlpine is not intimidated.
“Notre Dame is just like any other team in that they’ve got to come out and show up to beat us,” he said. “That’s the beauty of this game. If we come prepared, pay attention to details, and play sound defensively, we will give ourselves a chance to win and provide Notre Dame with a tough challenge.”
Due to the size of Iowa State and the challenge presented by Notre Dame, the two games this weekend will likely boost the RPI ranking of the Women of Troy regardless of the outcome. However, if the Trojans are able to come away with wins or draws in the two games, some significant movement could take place in the national rankings for the team, especially with a good showing against the Irish.
Even though it is still early in the season, the Women of Troy know that this trip is a great chance to prove that they can play with any team in the nation. More important for the team, however, is to take advantage of the opportunity to play two tough non-conference opponents in an intense environment before the perennially difficult Pac-12 Conference season.
“It’s no secret we play in a very tough conference,” McAlpine said. “This trip will help us prepare for that conference schedule, which will in turn help us position ourselves long-term to achieve the goal that we have had as a team from day one: to make it into the NCAA Tournament.”
Regardless of the outcome this weekend, McAlpine wants to see his players continue to play hard and improve. If they do this, he is confident that this team has what it takes to achieve their goals.
“We’ve grown better every day up to this point,” McAlpine concluded. “If we continue to grow this weekend and every week from this point on, we are going to be in a good place at the end of the season, when it really matters.”

On Aug. 20, a Liberian soldier shot 15-year-old Shakie Kamara in the leg during a protest of Ebola quarantine regulations in the West Point neighborhood of Monrovia, Liberia. According to NPR, Kamara was later pronounced dead.
The protests in West Point and resulting death of Kamara provide an uneasy resemblance to the current top news story in the United States — police injustice in the death of Michael Brown. Yet while the coverage of the Ferguson, Missouri protests has dominated every major American news outlet, the story of Kamara and the most recent Ebola outbreak has slipped out of media interest, presumably because it is being considered secondary news.
Jennifer Frazin | Daily Trojan
 
The Ebola virus is a highly contagious disease that needs to regain the spotlight in America and the rest of the world, given its central presence in West Africa. Though there is no simple answer to halting the spread of this pandemic, increasing global awareness of the disease and its symptoms is a necessary first step.
It is imperative that America start the conversation about Ebola awareness and prevention in the global community not only by promoting greater news coverage, but also by providing assistance to the countries in West Africa that have been left in the dark about this disease. This would hopefully lead to further medical and humanitarian strides to containing one of the largest outbreaks of Ebola noted in history. To put it in perspective, The New York Times reports that of the four million people in Liberia, fewer than 250 are doctors. This number does not account for the millions of West Africans living in the other two countries that are at the epicenter of the outbreak, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
More aid workers need to spread awareness of safety precautions that should be taken to combat the growth of the disease in individual communities. These aides should cooperate with local officials to isolate only the individuals infected with the disease — not entire communities like the West Point neighborhood. According to CNN, many civilians in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are afraid to report infected loved ones due to fear of social stigmatization, regardless of whether their community is quarantined. Mortality rates for the disease range from 50 to 90 percent, causing many civilians to view the survival of their loved ones as nearly impossible.
It is difficult not to sympathize with the hardships that these families face when their loved ones are infected. More civilians should be aware that chances of survival are greater when humanitarian authorities are contacted early. This awareness might promote a collective desire to heal as many people as possible. By informing these communities of the necessity of quarantine restrictions, it would then be possible for the World Health Organization to estimate the extremity of the disease more accurately with the inclusion of unreported cases. A more accurate total might also lead to a greater global concern and the dispatch of more first-world medical aides.
America’s role in containing the recent outbreak has been questionable, to say the least. Recently, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly, two American aid workers from the Christian humanitarian groups Serving in Mission and Samaritan’s Purse, respectively, garnered headlines in the American media after they contracted the disease during their efforts in West Africa. Both Writebol and Brantly were immediately quarantined at Emory University Hospital and treated by a group of physicians with an experimental drug by the name of ZMapp. Sadly, however, the thousands of West Africans who are most in need have no access to the drug.
Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego, the company that produces ZMapp, has reported that it has run out of the drug’s supply and that the drug needs to undergo further human trials to be deemed safe for public use, according to the Huffington Post. Administering the drug in trials to patients infected with a rapidly acting, and oftentimes fatal, virus seems like a built-in opportunity to conduct the trial. This seems like a viable option for thousands who are being quarantined against their will and have no other options aside from scarce medical care.
The nature of this situation, in which an experimental drug is unveiled when Americans contract the disease and later becomes unavailable after they are cured, is unsettling and paints a picture of a selfish America. Of course, the United States should have utmost concern for its citizens, but there must be an urgency to help these other disease-stricken countries as well. Increased American coverage and aid will halt the spread of Ebola and consequentially lead to medical and social progression for the communities in West Africa.

These are difficult and demanding times to be an American citizen. Within the nation’s borders, deep-seated racial tensions have risen to the surface yet again as Eric Garner of New York, Michael Brown of Ferguson, Missouri and countless unnamed and unarmed others have died at the hands of police following alleged excessive use of force. Then there are stories of countless refugees arriving in America in search of a better life. For them, extreme poverty and violence in several South American countries have been the catalyst for their perilous journey to the United States.
On top of that, there are the men and women American citizens have elected to make sense of these problems. They will return from a five-week recess on Sept. 8 to resume a session defined by bickering and unproductivity. According to statistics from the U.S. Senate’s Résumé of Congressional Activity, the current (113th) Congress has been the most unproductive on record since WWII in terms of public laws passed. Columns of newsprint can be — and have been — filled with criticism of elected officials. At a certain point, however, criticism becomes futile. At some point, the questioners should ask a few questions of themselves.
To slightly modify everyone’s favorite Spider-Man quote, with great political turmoil comes great responsibility. Most of the time, “State of the Union” will explore the responsibility of America’s national and local lawmakers to place matters of policy before matters of politics and deal rationally with the chaotic world we live in.
The responsibilities of the citizens who elect lawmakers are just as important as those of the lawmakers themselves. By voting, citizens forfeit their right to complain about the government when they don’t take an active role in selecting and discussing the actions of elected officials.
That’s where this column comes in. Voter turnout is at a pitiful level; according to the Huffington Post, 58 percent of eligible voters voted in the 2012 presidential election, and the most optimistic studies show no significant change in voting participation since 1972. It’s time, however, to do away with the American misconception that voting is the only way to exercise a meaningful voice in government. The belief that voting relieves folks from any further meaningful participation in civic life is dangerous. True, voting determines the makeup of most governing bodies, but elections for those bodies happen only once in a period of one, two, four or even six years.
So what are we to do in between? As the years of elected officials’ terms slip by, voting and thumb-twiddling in the meantime might be even worse than choosing not to vote. In fact, what voters do leading up to Election Day is far more important than what they do on Election Day itself. A few informed citizens who make a decision are far more important than 20 times that number of uninformed citizens making the very same decisions.
Being a well-informed member of a democracy is about participating in conversations, being able to articulate opinions and engaging in discussions. The media needs to generate more articles that inspire readers to do just that — that’s what this column is for.
The world is in too much turmoil nowadays for things to be merely read and not acted upon — so take to your keyboard, your dinner table or your cell phone, and let’s create a conversation.
