Earlier this month, incoming Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee presented a budget proposal for the 2018-19 academic year. Of the total $2.07 million budget, Lee proposed an allocation of $8,000 worth of funds to a school-wide, print-based New York Times subscription. This would mean that 100 print copies of the newspaper would be distributed across campus on a daily basis. This week, USG decided not to go through with this proposal, and is instead putting this money into the philanthropic fund used for service-based programs and initiatives. However, sponsoring Senator Michaela Murphy is still hoping to get a digital New York Times subscription funded by the board to give students more practical access to news.

While it is not financially or economically sound to spend thousands of dollars on a print subscription to the Times that, frankly, most students wouldn’t ever get around to picking up, putting money toward a digital subscription and fostering the idea of having a greater sense of local and global news on campus would be a step in the right direction for USC students. 
This digital subscription to the Times would include full access to the day’s news, every article written for the publication since 1851, Spanish and Mandarin versions of articles, mobile applications and more. As opposed to the original print proposal, this digital proposal would likely be useful to students who, while they may be interested in learning more about the world, cannot or do not want to pay for a New York Times subscription on their own. Considering the Times has the second-highest circulation ratings in the U.S. and recently won three Pulitzer Prizes, it’s no secret that accessing such a newspaper equates to accessing quality journalism. Among a range of other benefits, those with a subscription would be able to access “The Edit,” a student-staffed newsletter that contributes to the diverse range of voices published by the Times.
As Provost Michael Quick writes in the 2018 USC Strategic Plan, “Since its founding in 1880, the University of Southern California has embraced the two-fold mission of the American research university and has continuously evolved to meet its calling — to create informed and prepared citizens of the world, to advance new knowledge, and to serve the public good.” 
While USC has consistently focused on meeting its goals of serving the public good and creating new knowledge, in many ways it seems that we have forgotten about the University’s duty to create informed and prepared citizens of the world. 
Political apathy on this campus is rampant, with only 4,627 out of 19,000 undergraduate students voting in this past USG election — or about 24 percent. On the popular college prep website Niche, the second-most popular response by USC students to the question, “What political party do you associate yourself with?” was “I don’t care about politics.” While channeling large amounts of funds into philanthropic organizations and HBO subscriptions is all well and good, USC and USG must put more effort into creating a campus culture that values the idea of the informed citizen. We must tell students that this is a time to care about what is going on in the world, and that we as a school support our students’ interests in such topics. While a subscription to the Times may not be enough to truly remedy the lack of politically informed and curious students on campus, it is certainly a good start. At the very least, it will make more news accessible to those who can’t afford it on their own. 
Murphy and everyone else involved with making this digital New York Times subscription a reality should be commended for their commitment to changing the apathetic culture at USC and ensuring that this university is staying true to its core values. 
Taking a few thousand dollars out of this school’s multimillion dollar budget to provide students with a chance to be more informed and engaged is far from unrealistic, and should actually be one of USC’s priorities. To help students gain some political awareness would be to help them become the informed, prepared citizens of the world, as envisioned by this University since its inception. Put simply, it’s time for USC to keep up with the Times.

This year, Earth Day falls on Sunday, and it comes amid mounting scandals in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, new studies linking polluted air to increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease and substantial evidence of a correlation between lead-infested water in Flint, Mich., and higher rates of miscarriage and poor prenatal and maternal health. Earth Day seems to grow more important by the year, and all the more so now that the president of a major global power has, at worst, denied the existence of climate change and, at best, questioned its existentially threatening nature. 
The simple reality is that climate change and environmental protection are issues that affect all of us and future generations, but it’s also clear that this issue disproportionately and negatively affects various marginalized groups. In particular, the predominantly black community in Flint and the low-income, minority communities in areas like South L.A., where young people face increased risk of asthma and other health detriments due to pollution.
But in recent years — as demonstrated by the experiences of pregnant women and mothers in Flint — it’s become increasingly evident how climate change is also a global women’s rights issue. Our carbon footprints and other effects our lifestyles have on the climate impact not only the United States, but also developing countries around the world. Women comprise the majority of agricultural workers; growing numbers of women climate migrants and refugees face increased risk of sexual assault; and indigenous women lead fights in their communities to preserve sacred land from government-led oil ravaging. 
Anywhere, air pollution can have detrimental effects on pregnancy ranging from preterm births to increased risk of fetal impairment, as well as reduced fertility and elevated blood pressure and decreased function of the liver and kidneys if a woman is pregnant. The connection between reproductive health and climate change exists beyond women’s health and fertility. Earth surpassed its carbon tipping point two years ago, permanently pushing atmospheric carbon levels higher than 400 parts per million. And with climate scientists in agreement that climate change stems from human action, many postulate that lack of population control and inadequate access to family planning resources in many parts of the world certainly aren’t helping. 
In this sense, the election of President Donald Trump and his subsequent decisions to withdraw the United States from the historic Paris Climate Accords and gut the EPA aren’t the only ways he’s helped worsen an already bleak climate situation. The president’s executive order to defund global organizations providing information about contraception and abortion could also have an unsaid impact on countries in the developing world.
In addition to the inextricable link between environmental and reproductive justice, in Asia and Africa, the United Nations reports women are responsible for the vast majority of agricultural work and food production. In Sub-Saharan Africa, women are responsible for 60 to 80 percent of all food that is grown, and in Asia, for 50 to 90 percent of rice cultivation. Climate change has resulted in many women losing land ownership to companies experimenting with sustainable development, or being forced to shift their planting seasons or grow new, warm-weather food due to global warming. The United Nations has also reported that 63 percent of rural households in developing countries rely on women as water gatherers — an increasingly difficult task in an increasingly drought-ravaged world.
Over the course of 2015, Feministing reported on indigenous communities in Ecuador suffering displacement and loss of sacred land to the government’s oil pursuits, and the women protesters leading the way in the website’s Bearing Witness project on climate justice. The project similarly found that in Honduras, women have also taken the lead in the absence of their husbands who have migrated to the United States for work, as women lead communities wrecked by rising sea levels and the increasingly frequent and damaging natural disasters resulting from this.
At its core, environmental protection is more than the protection of the environment — it’s the protection of the people and groups that are the most vulnerable to polluted air, clean water shortages and natural disasters in their communities. It’s an issue that is deeply, almost inextricably connected to identity and social status. After all, it’s hardly a coincidence that Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe — the man notorious for holding up a snowball on the Senate floor as “proof” climate change is a hoax — is a wealthy white man. No individual who is actually, actively living through the hazards created or worsened by climate change can deny that it’s a reality. 
Like nearly every politicized issue you could possibly name, environmental justice intersects with myriad identity-based issues: racial justice, economic justice and, yes, even women’s rights and reproductive justice. Every Earth Day should be a time to recognize this.

Netflix makes a bold statement with its new hybrid-genre movie Je ne suis pas un homme facile (I Am Not An Easy Man). A gender-bending, farcical romantic comedy, the movie is set in an alternate universe run by women in which gender roles are completely reversed. In what Netflix describes as a “shameless chauvinist getting a taste of his own medicine,” Christophe (Pierre Benezit) must come to terms with this new world after hitting his head and awakening from a coma, all while falling in love with bullheaded writer Alexandra (Marie-Sophie Ferdane). The movie is written and directed by French filmmaker Eleonore Pourriat, who has made gender-bending movies with similar themes in the past.
Photo from IMDb.
The intended feminist message of the movie comes through clearly and adeptly. By employing some of the most extreme social gender stereotypes possible, the director unmasks their truly problematic nature of them. Her technique not only allows but also actually calls for a thorough examination of entrenched notions of gender and prescribed behavior in society. 
The film does not try to make a statement about how all men and all women behave, but it effectively addresses the preconceived biases many people hold. In this way, the value of the film is derived from its provocativeness, and the way it forces audiences to question what they are watching. 
Why does a woman holding a position of power, wearing a suit, drinking beer or making casually sexist statements strike viewers as absurd? Why do blatant dismissal and objectification of men seem so strange? The most compelling scene in the film is a discussion in which a central thematic question is posed: Shouldn’t men be grateful for their special treatment in society, like receiving gifts and having doors held open for them? This scene underscores a lack of understanding between the genders in the current dialogue. 
The film employs dark but easily digestible comedy, striking a balance between well-scripted, witty dialogue and cheap, slapstick humor. Pourriat’s approach to comedy focuses on seemingly miniscule facets of the gender dynamics inherent within social interactions. Benezit’s acting thrives in this comedic environment, as he awkwardly tries to avoid but eventually falls in sync with the new social rules around him. Vincent Elbaz  adds a hilarious element in his portrayal of Christophe’s best friend. 
Overall, the movie suffers from a general predictability that limits what could have been one of Netflix’s best movies yet. The story follows a generic rom-com narrative arc, and the directing, editing and cinematography all reflect the genre’s familiar tropes. The premise, though well-executed, does not offer enough originality for the movie to warrant praise on that aspect alone; after all, there are plenty of other films with similar concepts. Within the first few scenes, the audience is able to predict the majority of the revelations that the characters will have in the film’s flipped world. 
Despite the predictability, the movie is definitely worth watching. As a whole,  Pourriat makes important contributions to the discussion of gender and discrimination in the 21st century, delivered in a comedic, palatable package.

Ryan Song | Daily Trojan
Aside from reminding the world of Cardi B’s impending hip-hop dominance, an impressive result of her song “I Like It” debuting at No. 8 in its first week on Billboard’s Hot 100 is that it will surely solidify Latin rapper Bad Bunny in America’s public consciousness. The artist has had significant solo success with hits like “Sensualidad,” but his collaborations with American artists, while popular, did not receive  as much attention as the collaboration with Cardi B.
I first discovered Bad Bunny four months ago when my friend and I stumbled upon “Krippy Kush (Remix)” while flipping through radio stations. Despite the song’s repetive nature, evidenced in the annoying “kush kush kush kush kush” lyric, I loved it. Just recently, I started listening to more of his work and began hoping that others would too. Indeed, the possibility that Bad Bunny could become more popular here in the States after his recent hit with Cardi B  is the latest instance of my attempting to enjoy an artist before everyone else hops on the bandwagon.
Despite writing a music column this semester, I’m not as well-equipped to analyze music as other staff writers who consistently review albums. I usually can’t determine what song will become a major hit, or who will become the next big star. When something usually becomes a giant phenomenon, like The Chainsmokers’ “Closer” or Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonzi’s “Despacito,” I usually wait four or five weeks before hearing it because I don’t want my enjoyment to be ruined by the hype. However, when I am able to accurately predict a song or artist’s future success, I take great pride in the fact that I discovered them early.
I recently started following music reviewer Todd in the Shadows, who uploads yearly lists of the best and worst in music. Because these were his most enjoyable videos, I started to check Billboard’s Year End charts to predict what could make the lists.
Art by Di Wu | Daily Trojan
Eventually, it reached a point where checking Billboard’s Hot 100 would become a weekly routine. For most of high school, I wanted to see which of my favorite artists or songs would reign the charts at No. 1. When their songs stuck at the top spot, I was even more elated: When Drake’s “One Dance” reached its pinnacle in 2016, I was thrilled to see him hold No. 1 for 10 weeks (only to be topped by “God’s Plan,” which spent 11 weeks in the pole position this year). Although I enjoyed “One Dance,” I was shocked to see it remain at the top for so long.
Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk,” on the other hand, was the rare instance where I immediately (and not unintentionally) fell in love with the song and hoped that it would be a hit. I valued the fact that I listened to it during its initial release, and the moment it became overplayed during it’s 14-week run at No. 1, I began avoiding it.
I developed a general interest in music this past semester, partly so I could talk with my apartment mate who constantly blasts all the popular hits on his Beats Pill. It was at this time that I started looking at the Hot 100 more actively to see what entered the charts and what was in the bottom 50.
It’s impressive to make it into the Top 20, so Bad Bunny’s inclusion at No. 8 indicates that he could gain even more traction. Typically, when I find songs and artists before everyone else, it’s a sign that the artists will remain culturally prominent. But in this case, although Bad Bunny already had a sizeable following before his feature on Cardi B’s “I Like It,” I’m glad to have the opportunity to help his fan base grow even more, sharing more of his music with people who were intrigued by his verse on the popular song. 
Thus, as a final note for my column this semester, I highly recommend checking out the 21 Savage remix of Farruko’s “Krippy Kush,” featuring Bad Bunny and Nicki Minaj.

The USC Academic Senate passed a resolution expressing support for student activism and urging the University to improve sustainability initiatives at its monthly meeting on Wednesday.
The Environmental Core club hosted a “Do Better SC” rally last week that resulted in the Academic Senate passing a resolution in support of them Wednesday. Autria Mashian | Daily Trojan
Students from the Environmental Core, a club at USC focused on environmental advocacy, were present to show their support. USC associate professor Darren Ruddell, the co-chair of the Academic Senate Sustainability Committee, invited the students to the meeting to discuss the resolution.
The resolution is a follow-up to the ECore’s “Do Better SC” rally on April 8 and a formal letter sent to President C. L. Max Nikias by ECore representatives, the Environmental Student Assembly and the Undergraduate Student Government.
The resolution includes a copy of the letter and the University response from Executive Director of Administrative Operations Mark Ewalt.
“With the guidance, support and dedication of all the hard-working committee members and all the students, faculty and staff members who have been involved with Sustainability 2020 over the past three short years, the University has been able to design, fund and implement numerous high-impact projects and initiatives that speak directly to the concerns you identified in your letter,” Ewalt said in his response in the resolution. 
The resolution recognizes the “important progress” the University has made on the Sustainability 2020 Plan, but calls for further action. The senate previously proposed the Sustainability Strategy 2030 in March 2017, which has gained the support of the Staff Assembly, the Graduate Student Government and USG. 
“The Academic Senate reaffirms its support for the Sustainability Strategy 2030, expresses its support for the students and their advocacy, and joins with them in urging President Nikias to make USC a leader in this momentous struggle for the future of the planet,” the resolution states.
The Sustainability Strategy 2030 has not yet been approved by administration, which worries Philline Qian, the USG Sustainability Advocacy Director.
“There is no actual endorsement from President Nikias on [Sustainability Strategy 2030],” Qian said. “It shows lack of top-leadership at our University that there’s no clear action plan for after 2020, which is in one year.”
Members of the Senate asked the students present at the meeting questions about the student body. USC professor Jeremy Kagan asked the students how to engage what seems to be a politically inactive campus.
ECore director Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, a sophomore majoring in psychology, told the senate that many students are interested in sustainability or activism at USC, but that they may not take the initiative to start different movements. 
“A lot of students really need something to jump on to,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “They are interested; they may not be ready to march, but they’re ready to sign and they are ready to go to meetings and to listen.”
Shaw-Wakeman suggested the University provide students with a way to help and be more “intentionally transparent” by sharing information with students. 
Shaw-Wakeman and Qian said they are both grateful to have the attention and support of the Academic Senate. Qian said that having support from different groups from the University strengthens their voices and that students and faculty should work “in tandem.”
Shaw-Wakeman said she is encouraged by the senate’s attention and is hopeful that the organization can enact change on campus.
“From the student perspective, sometimes it does seem we’re screaming into a void,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “When you know that people who have the power to make change are listening to you then it means you’re going to keep trying to make change.”

The Academy stands as one of the oldest learned societies in the nation, honoring and bringing together exceptional scholars, leaders and innovators to create policies and initiatives to empower future generations. Other awardees this year include former President Barack Obama, actor Tom Hanks and author Ta-Nehisi Coates.
“I shivered a little to see my name next to Barack Obama in this announcement about our selection as members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,” Nguyen tweeted Tuesday.
According to a news release, Nguyen joins a cohort of historical figures including Charles Darwin, Martin Luther King Jr. and Benjamin Franklin. 
“This was a completely unexpected honor, for which I’m grateful,” Nguyen said to USC News.
Nguyen is one of the most decorated professors at USC. In 2016, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction with his novel The Sympathizer, which provides readers with “unconventional and critical” perspectives on the Vietnam War. 
Nguyen received several awards for the novel, including the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, the First Novel Prize for the Center for Fiction and the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Literary Excellence. 
In 2017, he was named a MacArthur Fellow and received the Guggenheim Fellowship. President C. L. Max Nikias named him a University Professor this February, an immense honor based on multidisciplinary interests and achievements. 
“Professor Nguyen applies his extraordinary talent as a scholar, writer and advocate to help us build empathy and broaden our understanding of the world,” said Amber Miller, the dean of USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, to USC News.
In addition to Nguyen, 23 other faculty members from Dornsife have been elected to the Academy.
According to the Academy’s website, the 238th class of American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellows will be inducted at a ceremony in Cambridge, Mass., this October.

Junior first basemen Dillon Paulson tallied 2 home runs in the Trojans’ nine frames against Loyola Marymount University. Wanting He | Daily Trojan
The Trojans suffered an 8-5 defeat against the UCSB Gauchos on Tuesday night, but redeemed themselves on Wednesday as they defeated the LMU Lions by a score of 6-1. Following these games, the Trojans now possess an 18-15 record on the year.
The Trojans entered this game coming off a disappointing series against the Arizona Wildcats in which they dropped two of three games at home. Following their weekend efforts, the Trojans stood at a 17-14 record on the year. On the other hand, the UCSB Gauchos entered this game with a 16-15-1 record on the season following a series loss to UC Irvine.
Both teams encountered earlier in the season in Santa Barbara, a game which the Trojans took by a scoreline of 9-3. Freshman pitcher John Beller was awarded the win on the day, while sophomore catcher Blake Sabol led the way in runs batted in and hits, as he batted home three runners while also tallying three hits.
Sophomore pitcher Austin Manning started on the hill for the Trojans against the Gauchos on Tuesday. He got off to a rough start, walking the first batter and allowing him to steal on a wild pitch. However, he put up three Ks to end the inning scoreless.
Meanwhile, the Trojans came out firing as Sabol opened with a lead-off single to start the bottom half of the inning. Sabol then managed to advance to second base following a sacrifice bunt by junior third baseman Brandon Perez. Sabol then stole third and would ultimately score on a sacrifice fly.
Both teams managed to get batters on base in the second and third innings, but no runs were scored. Manning struggled in the fourth inning as the Gauchos managed to put 3 runs on the board. Manning, who came into the game with only eight walks in 10 appearances, walked three batters in the fourth inning alone. He also allowed two runners to score on wild pitches and the other runner to score following a walk. 
The Gauchos followed up their hot fourth inning with another couple runs in the fifth frame. The Trojans responded with a run of their own as freshman right fielder Jamal O’Guinn scored courtesy of a sacrifice fly into left by junior third baseman Chase Bushor, taking the score to 5-2 after five innings.
The Trojans came alive again in the sixth inning as freshman shortstop Ben Ramirez produced a big 2-run double with the bases loaded to take the game to 5-4. The Trojans’ dominance wouldn’t last long as the Gauchos quickly plated a few runs in the seventh inning. 
Perez scored one more for the Trojans in the bottom of the seventh inning to advance to the game’s final score of 8-5 heading into the eighth inning. 
“Well, I thought we played poorly all around,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after the game. “We were are own worst enemy. There were no errors on the scoreboard, but we played poorly defensively. If we want to be the team we think we are capable of being then we can’t do that. I thought all around, it was one of the worst games we’ve played all year.”
The Trojans followed their defeat against the Gauchos with an impressive 6-1 win against the LMU Lions.
Beller took the mound for the Trojans and showed excellent command. He ended up pitching for eight innings and recording nine strikeouts, and only allowed one run, which was unearned. Beller showed substantial promise in his second start of the season.
However, the game was all about junior first baseman Dillon Paulson who clobbered 2 home runs in the game, his fifth and sixth of the season. He opened the scoring for the Trojans in the first inning with a 2-run blast into right field and later went yard again in the fifth inning leading the Trojans to a 6-1 victory.
Paulson wasn’t the only player to hit a home run in the Trojans’ win against the Lions. Junior left fielder Lars Nootbaar pounded a 2-run dinger of his own in the third inning, taking his home run total to 4 on the season. Redshirt sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy came up with the other RBI in the fourth inning as hit he a sacrifice fly to score sophomore centerfielder Matthew Acosta.
The Trojans will look to take momentum from this victory into their weekend series against the No. 13 ranked UCLA Bruins and improve their 18-15 record on the year. The games will take place at the Jackie Robinson Stadium on Friday night at 7 p.m., Saturday at 4 p.m., and Sunday at 12 p.m.

This weekend, the USC women’s water polo team will welcome the UCLA Bruins in the Trojans’ final match of the regular season. The rivalry game comes after USC’s final, and arguably toughest, back-to-back of the 2018 regular season. It is no easy feat for any team to succeed in contests on consecutive days, and even more difficult to do so on the road. Making matters just that much tougher, USC was slated to face two ranked teams including the nation’s top-ranked squad No. 1 Stanford.

After falling at the hands of the Cardinal in late February, the Trojans were out for revenge last Friday when they traveled to Palo Alto for the heavyweight bout. One of the keys to success for Stanford in the first meeting of the 2018 season was the Cardinal’s ability to strike early and often against the Trojan defense. Stanford picked up 3 goals in the first period as well as another 4 in the second to take a commanding, and ultimately decisive, 7-3 lead at halftime. This time things would be much different.
In the first quarter, USC made it out to a quick 3-0 lead over the nation’s top-ranked squad. Despite a couple scores from the Cardinal, the Trojans managed to carry a 4-2 lead into the half — a scoring increase over their first meeting against Stanford. In the second half, USC would benefit from another 3-0 scoring run that gave the Women of Troy a lead they would hold until the end, delivering the team a crucial 8-5 victory.
As expected, freshman driver Paige Hauschild was again the centerpiece of the USC victory as she, as well as senior utility Hayley McKelvey, netted 3 crucial goals for the Trojans. Furthermore, junior goaltender Amanda Longan came up big throughout the day, picking up 16 saves on the match and helping to stop eight of 10 Cardinal power plays as well as a Stanford penalty shot in the fourth quarter. 
“We came into this game with no fear,” Longan said. “Our confidence, this time, made all the difference.”
The following day, the Trojans marched into San José to take on the No. 21 Spartans on their home turf. This time, USC found much smoother sailing as they dominated San José State 12-1 — scoring the first eight goals of the match before conceding a power play score in the fourth period. McKelvey and Hauschild were, again, difference makers as both picked up a pair of goals while senior driver Brianna Daboub scored a hat trick of her own.
As things stand now, the Trojans have moved up to the top of the CWPA polls. With an incredibly impressive 20-1 record, and their sole loss coming from Stanford, USC has shown they can beat any team that comes their way. Whether in prolific shootouts or low-scoring affairs, the Trojans have constantly found a way to prevail this year and are lined up to receive the recognition they deserve.
This weekend, the squad will complete the regular season schedule with a match against crosstown rival UCLA at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.  Although the Trojans have done well over the course of the season — especially this past weekend — there are still a lot of areas where the team can improve.
“We’re focused on making the most of the time that we have,” Daboub said regarding the team’s focus. “We need to take every single day, every single practice as an opportunity to improve.”
The Women of Troy took the first contest against UCLA in early February this year by a 6-4 margin to claim the Triton Invitational Championship. Though the Bruins are not necessarily having a poor season, they have found it tough to overcome the other elite water polo squads in the state. In a combined five matches against USC, Cal and Stanford, UCLA has only managed to win one match, with the other four being their only losses this season.
The game will be aired on the Pac-12 Network on Saturday at 7 p.m.
