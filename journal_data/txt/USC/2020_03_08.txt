A new star was born Feb. 18 after a viral “finish the lyrics” video surfaced of Charlotte Awbery flawlessly belting out “Shallow” from the 2018 film “A Star Is Born.” The internet quickly fell in love with Awbery’s Farrah Fawcett coiffure and crystal-clear tone.
But as soon as Awbery went viral, social media archaeologists dug up an old photo of her wearing a Native American headdress and just like that, she was canceled. Time of death: Feb. 21, just three days after reaching virality. 
Or, the internet tried to cancel her. Outside the Twitter bubble, Awbery remains alive and well. After her short-lived cancellation, she continued to collect fame, even performing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Feb. 26.
This is not a story about whether you should wear a Native American headdress to a Halloween party (you shouldn’t). This isn’t even a story about whether someone should be “canceled” for this particular infraction. This is a story about the mob mentality that perpetuates the internet, the veritable lack of real-world consequences and what accountability really means in 2020.
Anyone who’s regularly on Twitter knows the speed at which cancellations occur, but they also know these controversies are often self-contained within the 280-character limit of the platform. Despite the internet’s short-lived fury, there is not a single published article about Awbery’s transgression.
Even when a cancellation makes it from Twitter to the real world, this public shunning is hardly effective. Consider all the celebrities and public figures whose transgressions have placed them in the internet’s collective crosshairs. Who actually faced consequences?
The fact of the matter is that post-cancellation consequences are the exception, not the rule. 
The most recent example of this exception is Harvey Weinstein, whose long-running career as a Hollywood producer was strangled by a tsunami of #MeToo allegations against him. He is now locked up in Riker’s Island after being convicted on charges of rape and sexual assault, but this accountability is hardly the rule among the upper echelons of the Hollywood elite.
Film director Roman Polanski has been accused of sexual abuse by at least six women, including a charge for the rape of a 13-year-old girl. Earlier this month, he won the award for Best Director at the César Awards, France’s equivalent of the Oscars. 
Woody Allen, another beloved film director accused of sexual assault, has made dozens of movies and received multiple lifetime achievement awards and Oscar nominations even after accusations he molested his young daughter.
Cancel culture doesn’t actually achieve its central aim, which is to cancel. Outside of Twitter rants and furious op-eds, careers still thrive and abusers still evade 
accountability. We have to confront these failures when we discuss cancel culture.
To the pundits who bemoan cancel culture as political correctness gone wild and rage over the possibility of ruining someone’s life: lose the mock sanctimony. Sleep soundly at night knowing few lives are being ruined, even if they have committed truly heinous acts.
To the internet crusaders waging war on anyone and everyone who misspeaks or missteps: log off Twitter. The canceling you cast down with false righteousness likely will not work. Do not sleep soundly at night thinking Twitter activism is the be-all and end-all of social justice. 
Now log back on to Twitter.
Internet cancel culture evades nuance. Internet cancel culture resembles a frenzied mob in Salem, Mass. circa 1692. It is retributive, not restorative. It lacks the empathy to allow fellow humans to make mistakes and learn from them. But internet cancel culture is, in fact, not canceled. At least not in my eyes.
For all its flaws, cancel culture can be a powerful instrument of accountability and justice. The #MeToo movement was ignited on the timelines of everyday people. The collective power of millions of internet consumers forced abusers such as Weinstein to reckon with the consequences of their actions. It is not the apex of accountability, otherwise people such as Polanski and Allen wouldn’t continue to thrive, but it’s a start.
The homegrown, grassroots activism of cancel culture is especially important to movements like #MeToo. Victims of marginalized groups often don’t receive equal considerations of justice from our legal system or even society at large.
Consider that Weinstein’s successful Hollywood career was linked to rumors of sexual abuse for over 20 years before the #MeToo movement eventually took him down. Conventional outlets never met their own demands of journalistic evidence because of Weinstein’s financial and legal prowess and victims’ fears of speaking up. Forums such as Twitter have an important function as a counter-mechanism of justice when traditional systems fail. 
Cancel culture is not perfect. Not even close. Its totalizing all-or-nothing mentality allows no room for growth or change. But if we can manage our expectations and realize that internet justice is only an aspect of social justice, just as voting is only an aspect of our civic duty, then we can appreciate the culture’s ability to protect marginalized victims and bring awareness toward the transgressions of powerful abusers. 
Accountability doesn’t end on the internet. But it’s a start.

In today’s highly competitive job market, the value of a college degree continues to increase. College graduates in the United States earn 71% more than those who only hold a high school degree, so it is clear that a key reason Americans attend college is to earn more income in the future.
In a technical and financial global economy with constantly increasing costs of living, it is understandable why universities are so focused on career building and students demand a learning environment focused on enhancing skills relevant to post-graduation job goals. This trend leaves less room for the development of students’ morals and character.
Indeed, college should be a stepping stone to a successful career, and it is certain that the United States’ higher education institutions are helping students prepare for the marketplace. However, while placing a greater emphasis on building job skills, USC must not leave behind other merits such as character and intellectuality.
The Marshall School of Business ranks as a top-10
undergraduate business school in the United States according to Niche, a website that ranks schools. The core curriculum comprises classes in communication, operations, economics, accounting and marketing. What’s missing is a class in business ethics.
A course on ethics in the business environment should be required for Marshall students to become acute, responsible leaders in the business world. From insider trading to pharmaceutical companies colluding on drug prices to bribing public officials and undercutting workers’ wages, there are always people looking for ways to get ahead in the world.
Of course, we can trust that most people will never make unethical decisions that could negatively impact millions of people. However, USC must do its best to ensure students will choose the public good over personal benefit. 
Another aspect of university life that has lessened as the focus has turned to skill-building is intellectuality through engaged, exploratory learning. This partly has to do with the rise of the digital age. Anyone can instantly broadcast their opinion on 
anything to the entire world without giving any intentional, meaningful thought or reflection on the matter. 
USC should work to inject environments of intellectuality onto campus and into classrooms. The University already requires a first-year seminar class, but the administration could encourage professors who teach 
lecture-style classes to include monthly discussions or debates. 
It is a common misconception that intellectuality only applies to the humanities. In fact, it applies to profession-oriented schools such as the Viterbi School of Engineering, Sol Price School of Public Policy and the School of Cinematic Arts just as much as it applies to students in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Thinking about and reasoning through difficult and complex ideas can and should happen in every field of study and must be embraced by the University even as education becomes more professionally driven.
As universities shift to prepare students for a more dynamic, fast-paced, evolving job market, it is imperative they do not leave behind two of their main purposes: to instill character in society’s future leaders and encourage intellectuality among its students.

Students are left with questions following USC’s decision to temporarily shift classes online for three days this week as it continues to evaluate its preparedness for the spread of coronavirus.
Friday’s community-wide email stated that all faculty will use Blackboard and Zoom to conduct classes Wednesday through Friday; however, some departments, faculty and teaching assistants have said they will still hold classes in person. This move has led to confusion among students, who said they have been frustrated by inconsistent communication and conflicting information about their classes following the email.  
While most lectures and seminars will meet through Zoom, multiple discussion-, performance- and lab-based classes will continue to meet in person during the three-day trial period, raising questions among students about these programs’ continuity plans should the University suspend classes in the future.
Samantha Ruzon, a sophomore majoring in theatre and political science, said most of her classes did not classify as lecture or seminar courses and would continue to meet in person Wednesday through Friday. Ruzon said she hadn’t received information from some of her professors and did not know what to expect. 
“I have a midterm in one of them and a performance [in] the other,” Ruzon said. “I want to know what to prepare for. If I’m going to have to take a midterm online, that makes my life a whole lot easier, but if I have to go to that class on Wednesday, I need to have my performance ready.”
The School of Cinematic Arts sent an email to production students Sunday, notifying them that courses not categorized as lectures and seminars will continue as normal. Students in “Organic Chemistry” were told laboratory sections and office hours would proceed in-person as normal during the three-day Zoom trial, with the same attendance policy the department normally enforces.
According to the letter sent to the USC community Friday, classes will resume in person as normal when students return from spring break March 23. The three-day trial period will be used to gather feedback on the platform’s feasibility in the case that the school were to use Zoom as a long-term solution due to an increase of coronavirus cases in the surrounding area. 
The University of Washington and Stanford University officially shifted all classes online on Friday after a rise in coronavirus cases in the area.
“As the COVID-19 (coronavirus) situation evolves, your safety and wellbeing are our main priority,” the letter read. “As a result, we continue to take precautionary measures to ensure that we are prepared for any potential disruptions to teaching and learning at USC.”
Zoom, the video conference service that will be used for the trial, links to Blackboard, allowing professors to deliver lectures virtually. The University currently uses Zoom for several online graduate degree programs, including some classes in the Rossier School of Education, the Sol Price School of Public Policy and the Davis School of Gerontology.
In a Friday interview with the Daily Trojan, Provost Charles Zukoski said USC will continue to monitor whether it will need to shift classes online in the long term. The final decision would be made depending on advice from health officials. 
“We have a policy following public health and [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] rulings,” Zukoski said. “It’s business as normal until that time, but we [will] continuously assess the situation … and look at all of the information that is coming in. The exact triggers will depend on exactly the situation … It isn’t a very explicit answer, but that’s because the situation is so fluid. We’re all learning as we go through.”
Some classes experimented with Zoom prior to this week. A pilot plan, led by the Committee on Information Services, had certain faculty members test out the program in February as part of Disaster Recovery Teaching Virtual Pilot Class, a program meant to evaluate alternative classroom teaching methods to use in disaster situations.
The program was established in Fall 2019 and has been primarily used for earthquake preparation, Chief Information Officer Douglas Shook said in an email to the Daily Trojan. Faculty were able to participate in the pilot on an opt-in basis. 
Karen Mendoza, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said her Marshall School of Business class participated in the pilot last week. 
“Two weeks ago, our professor had us test the [Disaster Recovery Teaching Virtual Pilot Class] because she told us that there was a possibility that [classes were to move online], so when I saw the email, I was not surprised,” Mendoza said. 
Alexis Garcia, a sophomore majoring in physics, said his physics professor was confused about the trial period and how it would affect labs and exams, especially in the case that online courses were to continue after spring break.
“From what I’ve heard told so far, most of the professors haven’t been told many details, and they’re not sure how exams will work, so I’m not sure if it could have a negative effect,” Garcia said. “For example, my physics class has a lab component, and I’m not sure what would happen if [classes moved online] permanently.”
While Mendoza said the risk coronavirus poses for students may not be urgent, she believes it is important to consider how coronavirus could affect others in the USC community, including older professors and employees. The disease is known to have more dire consequences for the elderly and those with impaired immune systems.
“If [coronavirus] hits younger people, they can recover, but if it hits older populations, they’re at greater risk,” Mendoza said. “A lot of the faculty wanted to do online [classes] since they were worried about their health, so keeping that in mind, I think that it’s a good measure.” 
She also said that although her professor had introduced the idea of transitioning to online classes, she hadn’t expected the implementation of the University-wide Zoom trial.  
“I didn’t expect it to happen soon,” Mendoza said. “I know that [the professor] mentioned it but it was almost like a suggestion. I didn’t think it actually would happen. I thought she was exaggerating it at the time.”
Ruzon, who is mainly taking theater and dance classes this semester, said she was unsure of what would happen if all courses are moved online permanently. Because her schedule comprises mostly performance-based classes, she was concerned they might be canceled for the remainder of the semester.
“That would be bad, especially for someone like me who is very tight on units,” Ruzon said. “I don’t want to have to stay here longer than four years since I can’t afford that.”
Mendoza, who plans to return to her hometown in Colorado if the University decides to shift classes fully online at any point, said she wished USC was more transparent on alternatives for future events like commencement but said she understood that making firm plans for cancellations might lead to premature upset. The University has yet to address how it will manage large campus events in the case of a shutdown.
“I think they should definitely let students know how [the University] is taking on graduation … being more transparent on that,” Mendoza said. “But I also understand that it’s too soon to tell … if they officially made an announcement, I think it would cause a lot of worry and anxiety.” 
As of now, classes will resume in person as normal when students return from spring break March 23. However, USC will continue to evaluate the spread of coronavirus over the next weeks. 
“This is an evolving situation and we are continually monitoring all possibilities,” Zukoski said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It’s hard to predict how this will go after Spring Recess. The safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff are our main priorities.”

With sleeping bags, energy drinks and laptops in tow, the attendees of AthenaHacks stream onto USC’s campus from all across the country every year to hunker down on a weekend technology project. They form small teams and attend workshops led by industry sponsors on tools to build virtual reality experiences, mobile apps and more. They listen to speakers, pitch their projects and win prizes, components of a typical hackathon. What’s not typical is that all of them — the organizers, guest speakers and participants — are women. 
Women make up 26.5% of computing roles today, a step down from 36% in 1991, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. Across Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, known as the “Big Five” within the tech industry, the number of female employees ranges between 29.2% and 41.23% according to the company’s most recent 2020 reports. While the Viterbi School of Engineering reached gender parity for the first time with the Class of 2023, under 40% of computer science students are women and even fewer transfer students are women, according to Viterbi Dean Yannis Yortsos.
AthenaHacks is a USC hackathon launched in 2017 to address the gender gap in the tech industry. Last year, it had 450 attendees, making it the largest all-women collegiate hackathon in Southern California.
Breaking from tradition, AthenaHacks consists of women of all backgrounds who build, break and try out tech at USC. Stephanie Lampotang, an AthenaHacks organizer, experienced the gender gap firsthand during her freshman year when she attended other hackathons.
“[AthenaHacks] was my seventh hackathon of that year … but [it] was the best one,” Lampotang said. “At the other hackathons, I always felt like it was a competition, and I was a kid that was walking in the race. But …  AthenaHacks felt like a group relay. Nobody was like, ‘You can’t look at what I’m doing.’”
AthenaHacks organizer Aliya Petranik, a senior majoring in computer science, said the gender ratio at a hackathon is an important factor in a hacker’s experience, especially for minorities in tech. 
“The gender balance in hackathons is still quite low,” Petranik said. “Women have this idea that they can only go if they’re going to be very competitive, if they know everything already. We’re trying to change that idea and promote the idea that you can learn how to build something at a hackathon.” 
In 2015, Asian women held 5% of computing positions, Black women held 3% and Latinx women held 1%, according to NCWIT. On campus, there are a host of tech clubs and initiatives highlighting women in tech, including Girls in Tech, AthenaHacks, Women in Computing and Society of Women Engineers, in addition to national organizations that support girls starting in high school such as Built By Girls and Girls Who Code. 
But clubs and programs can only put a Band-Aid on problems stemming from inequity in education. 
Former Built By Girls ambassador Glory Kanes, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, emailed Yortsos in her freshman year asking the dean if they could meet to discuss diversity and inclusion in computer science at USC. This sparked a series of meetings that continues today and now includes Cheyenne Gaima, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration. 
“Glory and I pretty much brought it up to our dean that while we have a pretty high number of girls entering computer science at Viterbi, we are not retaining those girls,” Gaima said. 
Yortsos said he is working to make the school more inclusive for women and minorities by offering resources and training faculty to recognize and eliminate their implicit biases. 
“You need to have many different views, particularly [as] technology and society are becoming intersected more and more,” said Yortsos, who described the technology industry as traditionally white- and male-dominated. “Ethics and technology ethics are very important.”
Yortsos also emphasized that Viterbi is not artificially increasing the number of women in its incoming classes but that the decreasing gender gap is the result of early structural change. 
Being a minority in tech involves more than gender, as the racial gap in tech is even more prominent. Gaima said she faced related challenges in her first engineering courses. 
“I was extremely excited and so ready to start … but being some of the time — or most of the time — the only Black person in a lot of my classes, I just felt so alone,” Gaima said. “When I first immediately observed it, I realized I need to find a community.” 
Gaima found mentors, resources and support in the USC chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. 
Luz Camacho, vice president of the membership committee of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, joined the organization because of the mentorship and friendship it offered her while navigating her freshman year. 
“There’s quite a fair amount of women in computer science [at USC],” said Camacho, a junior majoring in computer engineering and computer science. “In industry, the demographics are a little different, but at least here at USC … I think I was more aware of the fact that I was the only Latina in the room than I was aware of the fact that I was one of few women.”
Kanes, Gaima and Camacho all said they had experienced imposter syndrome in certain computer science classes notorious for their difficulty, where they felt other male students already had more coding experience and could relate to the professors more easily through similar interests like video games. 
“It’s this culture that’s taught toward people with … experience in this male-focused dominated industry,” Kanes said. “I passed with a 52% [in “Data Structure and Object Oriented Design”], and I got sick from that semester. It has been my goal for no woman to feel the way that I did [my freshman year].”
Until there’s a cultural change in tech, Kanes said, there will likely be no change in the future of the tech industry’s diversity.
“It’s great that we’ve reached gender parity [in Viterbi] and all,” Lampotang said. “But if you have a bunch of women in a place where 50% of the women don’t feel comfortable or things aren’t accessible or open to them, and they feel like they don’t belong, then [you] haven’t done anything.”

Former USC student and journalist extraordinaire Eric He captured the achievement of USC men’s basketball’s 54-52 win over UCLA Saturday at Galen Center best when he tweeted, “Probably the best moment of the Andy Enfield era.”
He was quote tweeting another post with a video of senior guard Jonah Mathews’ game-winning 3-pointer that gave the Trojans a bye in next week’s Pac-12 Tournament and likely secured the program’s first NCAA Tournament berth since 2017. For this reason, the shot is likely as important to Enfield, the team’s head coach, as it is to Mathews.
Despite leading the Trojans to their winningest five-year stretch in program history, Enfield has inspired a fair amount of malaise in USC fans recently, albeit not as much as other coaches on campus. In just his third season after taking over a cellar-dweller, Enfield steered the Trojans to the tournament in 2016, and he oversaw the Trojans’ best tournament effort in a decade in 2017. However, after USC became the highest-ranked major conference team ever to miss the Big Dance in 2018 and posted a losing record despite a talented freshman class in 2019, the heat was on Enfield to deliver strong results this season.
It was an up-and-down road to get there, but Enfield has the chance to alleviate any concerns about his job security. More importantly, he has the chance to reach the pinnacle of his USC career and continue a promising trajectory for the program.
It started with the best recruiting class in team history. The addition of five-star freshman forwards Onyeka Okongwu and Isaiah Mobley gave the Trojans young talent and depth to mix with senior forward Nick Rakocevic on the front line. Enfield also made the smart call of inserting graduate transfer guard Daniel Utomi into the starting lineup in place of sophomore guard Elijah Weaver, adding shooting to the starting lineup and giving the bench a capable ball handler. 
Enfield has put together a solid squad, and now the most important stretch in the history of USC men’s basketball starts in Vegas. The Trojans have a really good chance for an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament already (ESPN’s Joe Lunardi currently has the Trojans as a 10 seed), but they can establish themselves as a true threat with a strong showing in their conference tournament. If they can find a way to win the Pac-12 tournament, they will likely move up a few seeds.
Due to the lack of elite teams, there has never been a better year to be a lower seed in the NCAA Tournament. Anyone can beat anyone this year — for reference, take Duke and Kentucky losing to Stephen F. Austin and Evansville, respectively. Most seasons, you can bet on three of the Final Four teams to be top-three seeds, but the decline in quality at the top of the bracket should lead to even wilder upsets and deeper Cinderella runs this season. The higher USC positions itself, the better its chances of pulling off a deep run.
Please don’t follow my example and get ahead of yourselves by thinking the Trojans have a shot at making the Final Four. This is the same team that lost three straight conference games this season and has struggled with inconsistency. They also needed a last-second shot just to beat the bubble-straddling Bruins at home. I would be surprised if USC kept up its current level of play in Vegas and shocked if they made real noise in the NCAA Tournament.
But the fact that they have a chance to do so is what matters. Enfield has already continued his recruiting prowess by securing Evan Mobley, brother of Isaiah and the No. 1 recruit in the incoming class of 2024 according to 247Sports. If the Trojans can exceed expectations in both of their upcoming tournaments, they will have the chance to impress even more recruits, like Sierra Canyon’s Ziaire Williams, and entice them to don the cardinal and gold.
This is how programs improve: attract some recruits, display growth and competence, parlay that into more high-level players and repeat. If you do it enough, it becomes a snowball effect that carries forward and allows you to get the best incoming freshmen based on name brand alone. USC is far from becoming a basketball powerhouse, but there is the layout of a plan to get there through a lot of small steps.
USC has made a lot of those strides so far. It must continue in Vegas if Andy Enfield wants to build something special.

USC boasts many talented female athletes who have made strong impacts in their respective sports. In honor of International Women’s Day on Sunday, here are some of the standout women from USC’s spring sports teams:
Twanisha “TeeTee” Terry — Track and Field
Junior All-American sprinter TeeTee Terry has no one left to beat at USC but herself. In 2019, Terry broke her own school record in the 100-meter dash, which she first set as a freshman. She also anchored the four fastest 4×100-meter relays in USC history. 
As captain, TeeTee leads the team by example.
“She’s very dedicated— she leads by doing,” said Caryl Smith Gilbert, director of track and field. “She’s always there to lend a helping hand.” 
With over 37,000 followers on Instagram and 2,000 subscribers on YouTube, Terry says her fans, who she calls “Teebabies,” motivate her to be better.
“The different people around the world I inspire to go out there and be their best version of themselves, on the track, off the track … that kind of keeps me going,” Terry said in her most recent YouTube video. 
According to Gilbert, Terry’s work ethic is incomparable. 
“It’s going to be hard to ever replace TeeTee,” Gilbert said. “She has a desire to be great. She absorbs everything a coach says to her … She looks for advice. She looks for knowledge … That’s hard to come by — a hard worker who really wants to do what [coaches] tell them.”
After winning last week’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Indoor Championships race, Terry will compete alongside seven other USC women, the Women of Troy’s 4×400 meter relay team and four men in the 2020 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships where she will look to defend her NCAA indoor title in the 60-meter race.
Alissa Pili — Basketball
Four-time Pac-12 Freshman of the Week and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year forward Alissa Pili dominated in her first season for the USC women’s basketball team. She is the first Trojan to earn the title of conference Freshman of the Year since 2009. 
“It’s a big accomplishment and I’m proud,” Pili said in an interview with USC Athletics. “And I’m just happy I’m making my family and everyone else really proud.”
The Anchorage, Alaska native is also the only USC women’s basketball player to be named to the All-Pac-12 Team as a freshman and is the lone freshman on this year’s honorary roster. 
As the second-highest leading scorer in conference games, Pili defied all expectations, including those of head coach Mark Trakh. 
“We thought she might not start at the beginning of the year,” Trakh said. “So she earned it. She came in, and she did everything that she needed to do, and she turned out to be a pretty good player … We’re very proud of what she did.” 
Her coach isn’t the only one Pili impressed, however. Rival UCLA coach Cori Close commended Pili’s strength.
“She’s stronger than anything,” Close said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “She is one of the best freshmen in our conference, certainly, but even around our country.” 
Angela Kulikov — Tennis
Senior captain Angela Kulikov has been a dominant force in both singles and doubles competition for the Trojans. In her impressive junior campaign last year, she and her partner Rianna Valdes came into the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 doubles pair in the country. Kulikov was also named to the All-Pac-12 Second Team after going 16-4 in singles play.
Kulikov is having a strong senior season thus far. She was most recently ranked No. 27 in singles before upsetting No. 15 Cal freshman Haley Giavara Saturday. She and freshman partner Eryn Cayetano were the No. 16 pair before falling to Giavara and freshman Valentina Ivanov.
Kulikov said her motivation comes from knowing she can be a role model for the game’s next generation.
“I think it’s super important that, for one, [motivation] comes from yourself,” Kulikov said. “It’s easy to want to please other people, please your parents, please your teammates. But I think as I’ve gotten older … [I saw] that can make an impact on those younger than me and those who are going to come up next, so I’d say that’s the biggest motivation from me at this point in my career.”
Kelsey McIntosh — Water Polo
Senior driver and Southern California native Kelsey McIntosh has been a consistent scoring threat across her four years at USC. She scored 21 goals in her freshman season, and as a sophomore, she was instrumental in the Trojans’ MPSF Tournament victory with 2 goals in the championship match against Stanford.
McIntosh stepped up her game even further during her junior year, scoring 34 goals with 10 multiple-goal performances. She once again came in clutch in the tournament setting, putting up 2 goals in the MPSF Tournament and 2 more in the NCAA Tournament. Following the season, McIntosh was named an All-American Honorable Mention and All-MPSF Honorable Mention.
USC head coach Marko Pintaric said that while McIntosh has had to work to become the scoring threat she is now, she has always had a high aptitude for the game.
“Her water polo IQ is very high, [but] she was more of a passer coming out of high school and a set player,” Pintaric said. “So she grew offensively and became a very good shooter and somebody that you can’t leave open right now. Definitely a problem for opponents.”
This season, McIntosh is fourth in scoring for the Trojans with 19 goals through 13 games.
Although McIntosh is an important offensive instrument for the team, Pintaric said her most important role comes as a leader.
“She’s one of the team captains, so definitely I would say [her] leadership [stands out],” Pintaric said. “She’s [the] coach’s voice in the locker room and the reason why we are the team [that] we are right now.”

From David Bowie to Destiny’s Child to Stevie Nicks and Elton John, this year’s sophomore pop music showcase featured an array of covers from the ’60s to modern-day. The groovy, stylistically nuanced showcase took place at Carson Center Friday night with captivating and energetic performances from a wide range of talented, confidently prepared Thornton School of Music sophomore student vocalists and musicians. 
Ted Bordeau, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, opened the show, with “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by Tears for Fears.
“Every week, we learn three new songs as a band, we rehearse [and] we present them to Sean [Holt] every Tuesday,” Bordeau said. “This performance is what he believes is the best material we’ve encountered throughout the semester and so then we work on it for a couple more weeks. So hopefully by tonight it’s really tight because we rehearsed it and we know everything in it now.”
Led by Holt, assistant professor of the popular music and music production programs in Thornton, performers continued to impress the crowd with songs that they had been fine-tuning for the last eight weeks. Daniel Leese, a freshman majoring in jazz voice, plays the trumpet for the bands in his class, joining songs such as  “Fire” by the Ohio Players and “Let’s Groove” by Earth, Wind & Fire. 
“My major is for voice, but getting to play trumpet in this band and getting to study all of the music that has informed popular music from the ’40s up until now and how the horns work into that music has been fascinating,” Leese said. “Every instrument in the band has a different function but every function is equally as important, so when a song has horns, they’re there for a reason.”
The students are placed into bands by their professors and play a variety of songs and material from various genres throughout the semester. Showcasing the songs that resonated the most with them, each brought their specific expertise and styles of making the original song work within their techniques of practice. They were able to give popular music classics of the past a revival. 
Band after band, artist after artist, the performances all felt refreshingly current. It comes as no surprise that the performers had been practicing for the showcase, which doubles as their midterm, for the past eight weeks. 
“We have to recreate every single part that’s on the record — every sample, every background vocal, every little percussion part,” said drummer and percussionist Dominic Anzalone, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance. “It’s a lot of keen listening. I think freshman year, we do a lot of Motown, James Brown, The Beatles, so they really have us listen in and make sure that every part is represented and the parts are right.”
The energy emanating from the audience and musicians was contagious. Seniors from the Thornton pop music performance also attended to support the sophomore performers. 
For bassist Andrew Pham, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, being on that stage was both encouraging and frightening. 
“It’s terrifying but comforting at the same time,” Pham said. “We spend so much time in this room, so we’re very familiar with the room and how it feels to be in it. Seeing all the friendly faces … makes the room feel a little different, but we still have that advantage of knowing it very well … Seeing everyone show up, even before [the] music starts, that’s super rewarding that people make time to see live music and still support it. Even showing up early to grab a seat. That really does mean a lot.”
Singer-songwriter Sophie Feldman, a sophomore majoring in psychology and popular music performance, was elated to be back on stage. After spending the past few days on recommended vocal rest, Feldman sang covers of “Life on Mars?” by David Bowie and “I’m So Excited” by The Pointer Sisters.
“I steamed my voice, I took my supplements, did a wellness shot — all of those things we are told to do to keep ourselves healthy,” Feldman said. “I went on voice rest all day. I didn’t talk to my roommates, I didn’t talk to anyone until I started warming up. The first thing I sang, aside from warming up, was sound check.”
Feldman said the group’s teamwork and diligence allowed the work to come together.
“In our sophomore class, we have a saying where everybody is [a] music director, because freshman year we each get assigned a music director for the band,” Feldman said. “Now, everybody’s really responsible for keeping each other accountable and it’s been incredibly informative.”
All of the practice, time devoted toward studying the intricacy of pop music and relentless drive the sophomore popular music performance class manifested itself in the way they came together as musicians, and as peers, to deliver a powerful show.

I was raised to revere cashmere. My mom owned a few cashmere sweaters, in grey, black and green, and when I touched them they were as soft and fluffy as clouds. Instead of hanging them up in the closet, she’d fold them neatly and slip them into Ziploc bags to stave off hungry moths.
I was careful never to accidentally toss them into the washing machine with all the other laundry — these sweaters required a special trip to the dry cleaners. She gifted me one when I went off to college; when I slip it over my head, it’s snug and downy against my skin, as if I’ve sprouted a layer of fur. 
Cashmere gets its name from the Kashmir goat. These goats, which are native to the Himalayan mountains in China and Mongolia, must withstand extremely harsh weather. To cope with minus-30 degree Celsius temperatures, the goats grow two coats: a thick, coarse outer coat and a superfine, supersoft inner coat. The latter only makes up around a quarter of the goat’s total fleece, and they are the fibers that comprise cashmere.
Cashmere is up to three times more insulating than sheep’s wool and much more expensive too. For one, it’s quite difficult to gather — most of this downy hair is collected by hand during the goats’ molting season. The average sweater requires hair from four to six goats, as the yield per goat is quite scarce, ranging from a few grams to about 0.5 kilograms — a number that gets reduced even further once the hair has undergone treatment and processing. One goat typically yields about 150 grams of cashmere per year. 
As a result, cashmere is knitwear’s ultimate luxury textile; it’s rare, it’s hard to harvest and it’s much more comfortable and delicate compared to scratchy fibers like lambswool or mohair. Starting all the way back in the 14th century, demand has always outpaced supply. 
Until now. Cashmere was once the provenance of the well-off; few could afford its hefty price tag. But nowadays, you can find cashmere for as little as $50. More people can just waltz into a fast-fashion store such as H&M or Uniqlo and stock up on cashmere sweaters, scarves and socks. How, you ask? The answer is as always when a price is too good to be true: through exploitation and overproduction. 
Historically, cashmere has originated from nomadic tribes who shepherd their flock of goats across the vast Mongolian steppes; in fact, cashmere is Mongolia’s second-highest earning export. But cashmere production has increased dramatically in recent years — almost 300% since the 1990s — which forces the herders to keep up by settling for lesser-quality wool and adding more goats. There are now over 61 million goats in Mongolia causing unsustainable, irreversible damage to the land through overgrazing. Kering’s Environmental Profit & Loss tool calculates cashmere as having 36%more environmental impact than plain old wool. 
Look, I’m not trying to dissuade anyone from experiencing their own slice of cashmere heaven. Feeling the fine, gauzy texture of cashmere against your skin is one of life’s great pleasures (at least, I think so). But at the very least, consume cashmere mindfully. 
Keep in mind that a $50 cashmere sweater won’t be anywhere near the same quality as a $200 one. Also, be aware that some products marketed as 100% cashmere have been found to contain yak fur or even rat hair. Save up and take care of your cashmere by occasionally dry cleaning them and storing them in bags, and it’ll last you a lifetime.

Performers and attendees flocked to McCarthy Quad on Saturday. where the Black Student Assembly’s Creative Experience Committee hosted the 10th annual GearFest. This year’s theme, “Ascension,” served as the festival’s mission statement: to elevate and empower Black students, artists, musicians, performers, creatives and vendors to find their higher calling.
The music festival component of the event primarily highlighted student talent, save for the headliner — Maryland-born, Los Angeles-based singer Brent Faiyaz — and special guest Troi Irons, a Los Angeles-native musician. The lineup included performances from student artists Ayoni (Ayoni Thompson), Kabwasa (Etienne Kabwasa Green), JAiRUS (Jairus Edwards) and Vietta (Stephenie Lawrence). 
Since summer, the Creative Experience team has been working to make this year’s GearFest a reality. Creative Experience co-director Gogo Chilaka developed the theme as early as last summer. Chilaka, a senior majoring in business administration, spearheaded the event alongside her co-director Kionte Hickman, a junior majoring in architecture.
“The idea with ‘Ascension’ was that we wanted everyone in attendance to feel like being at the event put them in line with their future,” Chilaka said. “I wanted the event to be bigger, to ascend into a bigger thing so that it continues.”
When Faiyaz took the stage for his headlining performance, he seamlessly transitioned between songs from his latest release “Fuck the World” and select cuts from his 2017 project “Sonder Son.” He played nearly every track from “Fuck the World,” including crowd favorites “Been Away,” “Let Me Know” and the album’s title track.
“USC, how y’all feeling?” Faiyaz asked the crowd of USC students gathered at McCarthy Quad. “This is a good ass crowd, I’m fucking with y’all. Appreciate the love, for real.”
One of the standout student sets of the day came from JAiRUS, accompanied onstage by a nine-person band composed of Thornton School of Music jazz students and alumni, brought a soulful energy indicative of his musical origins — he grew up singing in his church.
“I’m really pleased with how everything came out and everything that I heard,” said JAiRUS, a junior studying music (jazz voice). “The crowd’s energy was really great and I thought it was a pretty groovy time … I tried to apply [this year’s Ascension theme] to my own message that I like to give about love, so taking love to the next level.”
GearFest featured more than just music. In line with the event’s name, the festival hosted a fashion show in which students sported gear made by stylists from the USC community. A month before the event, Creative Experience crowdsourced its models by sending out a casting call on Instagram.
“It was really nice to see such a diverse and inclusive cast of models being represented at USC,” said Netra Bhat, a freshman attendee majoring in mathematics. “The clothes in the show were unlike anything I’d ever seen before.”
Opposite the quad from the stage, Creative Experience set up installations, including a chalkboard for attendees to write how they will ascend and an immersive experience dubbed “Vibe Check” where students could have their tarot cards read in a tent made of holographic, multicolored material. 
For photo ops, the committee set up a reflective, three-tiered pedestal with a wicker chair beside it to evoke an iconic photograph of Black Panther Party leader Huey Newton. 
Tents lined the quad displaying artworks, crafts and clothing made by students and community members. Companies like The Dublife Co., which creates Western clothing with African aesthetics and BLEX, which features prominent Black figures on their clothing, sold their products to festival goers. 
“There was a lot more participation with student artists [and] vendors selling stuff, so I like that in comparison to last year,” Hickman said. “We had three community vendors that we reached out to and then we had six student vendors that reached out to us.”
Attendees were satisfied with how the festival met its goals through art, culture and community.
“I feel happy — it went well, I’m really glad,” Chilaka said. “To have gone through that whole process to get [Faiyaz] here and then to have been there felt really good, felt very full circle.”
