Every week, I’ll be sharing simple, healthy and affordable recipes to encourage college students to cook from scratch.
There are few foods more comforting than a steaming bowl of spaghetti with homemade tomato sauce. Familiar and satisfying, pasta is the ideal dish for a long night of studying or a cozy dinner with roommates. Since most sauces require several minutes of bubbling away on the stove, however, many college students may be tempted to reach for a jarred alternative. This ingenious recipe adapted from Martha Stewart Living is healthy and packed with bold flavor, but can be whipped up in less time than it takes to order takeout.
Delizioso · This week’s recipes deal with one of the most affordable ingredients: pasta. Usually between 99 cents and $1.50 at the local Fresh and Easy store, pasta dishes are an affordable and satisfying way to entertain guests and prepare various tasty meals on a budget. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
Rather than preparing the pasta and sauce separately, simply place all the ingredients in one pan and stir them together over high heat for nine minutes. This method keeps dirty dishes to a minimum and results in perfectly al dente spaghetti every time. Plump cherry tomatoes give the sauce its freshness, complemented by a subtle kick from the crushed red pepper flakes and sweetness from the sliced onions.
As the pasta cooks, it releases starch, which thickens the sauce and provides creaminess despite being completely vegan. While a generous sprinkling of grated Parmesan never hurts, the dish is luxurious and silky even without the addition of cheese.
Once you nail the basic formula, feel free to get creative with different variations of the classic. Swap in canned tomatoes, spinach and olives for a quick puttanesca, or add a handful of arugula and some thinly sliced ham. Take advantage of the opportunity to clean out leftovers from the refrigerator, tossing in steamed vegetables or ground beef. The recipe accommodates whatever you have on hand, stays fresh throughout the week and is easy to reheat in the microwave when you are pressed for time.
Best of all, even the most novice cooks can execute this fool-proof dish. If you are wary of stepping into the kitchen alone, cooking is a excellent way to bond with roommates. Since the recipe is affordable but still produces a generous amount, it is a great meal to serve to company. As everyone eases into the first week of school, get to know your neighbors by inviting them over for a casual dinner party. Food is one of the most effective ways of making friends in college, and with homemade pasta this tasty, your guests may never want to leave your apartment. No matter when you decide to try it out, after you make this quintessential recipe once, it will surely become a fixture of your weekly dinner rotation.
 
One-Pan Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce 
This simple recipe is hassle free and still allows for some great Italian flavors on a budget. The best part? It’s all made in one pan, so less dishes after everyone’s done.
 
Active: 15 min; Total: 20 min
Serves 4-6
 
– 12 ounces spaghetti or capellini
– 12 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved or quartered if large
– 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
– 5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
– ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
– 2 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for garnish
– 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
– 4½ cups water
– Salt and pepper to taste
– Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving.
 
1.Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, red-pepper flakes, basil, oil, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and water in a large straight-sided skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil mixture, stirring and turning pasta frequently with tongs, until pasta is al dente and water has nearly evaporated, about nine minutes.
2.Sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan, if desired, and serve.
 
Meaty Chicken Sausage Spaghetti
 
Daily Trojan editor-in-chief Euno Lee swears by this recipe for easy, stress-free entertaining when your pasta needs to be dressed up a little. The extra simmering time helps to take away some of the acidity from the tomatoes, while the chicken sausage adds some healthy protein to an already low-fat dish.
Though chianti wine can be pricey, Trader Joe’s has an excellent selection of budget-priced options that are excellent for cooking.
 
Active: 25 min; Total: 45-90 min.
 
– 1 12 oz. package of spaghetti
– 3 chicken sausages, removed from casing and chopped into bite-sized chunks
– 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
– 1 medium onion, diced
– 1 16 oz. can crushed San Marzano Tomatoes
– 2 tbsp. chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley
– 1 cup Italian red-wine (I prefer the cheap Chianti from Trader Joe’s)
– Olive oil
– Salt and pepper to taste
-Freshly grated parmesan reggiano
 
1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until just before smoking. Add sausage and cook until browned. Add onions and saute until translucent. After about 1-2 minutes, add garlic and saute until browned.
2. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, making sure to stir vigorously and get all the caramelized bits off the bottom of the pan.
3. Once the wine has reduced by half, add crushed tomatoes, parsley, salt and pepper.
4. Let simmer at low heat for up to 45 minutes to remove all acidity from tomatoes.
5. While sauce is simmering, put water, tablespoon of olive oil and salt in a large saucepan and bring to boil. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and set the timer for seven minutes.
6. Once pasta is still firm to the bite but almost fully cooked, drain and add to the finished sauce.
7. Mix thoroughly and sprinkle with extra chopped parsley and parmesan reggiano to serve.
8. Dish serves 3-4.

On Saturday night’s annual Welcome Week concert, students of all ages found themselves at McCarthy Quad — cotton candy in one hand, boba tea in another — hoping to sing and dance the night away to this year’s guest artist, Nico & Vinz.
He’s not wrong · Nico & Vinz headlined at the Welcome Back Concert this year to an enthusiastic reception from the crowd. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
The student body is abuzz with excitement every year before the Concerts Committee reveals the headliner. As soon as Welcome Week starts, it doesn’t take long before people start guessing which artist will be performing. This year, there was news that the headliner had a major hit all summer.
Would USC get “fancy” with Australian hip-hop sensation Iggy Azalea or British soul singer-songwriter Sam Smith? With the VMAs the following night, every artist seemed to be spending the weekend in Los Angeles, which made the list of options endless. After many agonizing days of suspense though, it was revealed that Norwegian duo Nico & Vinz, whose single “Am I Wrong” had been on repeat on every radio station this summer, would perform at USC’s hallowed McCarthy Quad.
The night began with a performance by Robert DeLong, a rising star in the genre of electronic rock ‘n’ roll. Touted by MTV and Billboard as “2013 Artist to Watch” and having earned performance slots at Ultra Music Festival and Coachella, he worked the crowd into a frenzy with his dazzling combination of electronic dance beats and live instrumentals.
Few electronic dance music disc jockeys play instruments during their performances. Even fewer provide the vocals for their own tracks. As a one-man band with a full array of keyboards, drum kits and guitars, DeLong created the perfect combination of synthesized recordings and live music, demonstrating his immense talent in merging two isolated genres into a musical spectacle.
As DeLong completed his sets and exited the stage, the crowd began to swell with excitement in preparation for Nico & Vinz. The Concerts Committee is known for bringing up-and-coming artists to the school. In previous years, the outdoor venue has hosted superstars like Katy Perry, Cold War Kids, Hellogoodbye and White Panda. It’s clear that Nico & Vinz very much fit this category.
Formerly known as Envy, Nico Sereba and Vincent Dery began singing and writing music together in 2009. It wasn’t until earlier this year, however, that the two saw their work become an international success.
“I went to their concert knowing one song,” said Zachary Suite, a sophomore majoring in interactive entertainment. “But I came back to my room and pre-ordered their new album right away on iTunes. I think in a year’s time, everyone will have Nico & Vinz on their iPods.”
The duo did not disappoint, entering in a cloud of smoke and quickly working the crowd into a communal euphoria.
As musicians with roots in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, respectively, the laid-back tribal vibes in their music were evident from the beginning. Their energy and smiles were infectious, and they quickly built an intimate connection with the audience. Students couldn’t help but dance and sway their hands to the music perfect for a beach resort. Because it was their first college show, Nico & Vinz were eager to please and show off their talents, shouting out to the crowd and showing off some impressive dance moves to complement their silky smooth vocals.
Though they’ve only recently risen to fame, it’s clear that both artists are very comfortable on stage. “Am I Wrong” was naturally the crowd favorite, but other less well-known songs such as “In Your Arms” and “One Song” were enthusiastically received.
While some artists hope to connect with their listeners through tales about romance, heartbreaks and revenge, Vinz explains on his website that he and Nico hope to inspire people to find happiness through their music. “We sing about things we’ve been going through and about finding ourselves,” he wrote.
Nico & Vinz’s new album Black Star Elephant will be released on Sept. 16. If their summer anthem is any indication at all, this album will surely be an epic one, with a solid 4.5 stars rating already on iTunes. The two Norwegians certainly have a bright future ahead, and even though they’re relatively new to the limelight, it’s known around campus that USC’s Concerts Committee definitely wasn’t wrong to select Nico and Vinz for the Welcome Back Concert this year.

From his Twitter handle (@Max) to his business strategy, USC graduate and successful businessman Max Mullen is straightforward and succinct.
Mullen, a 2007 graduate of the Marshall School of Business, spared no more than a few words to describe his philosophies for co-founding successful new grocery delivery service, Instacart.
Fast food · From organic cilantro to Pacifico Clara beer, Instacart delivers fresh groceries right to your door within an hour. Participating stores include Costco Wholesale, Whole Foods Market, Super King and Ralphs. — Photo courtesy of instacart.com
Started in 2012, Instacart is a “unique marketplace between customers and shoppers,” and Mullen said he would have loved to have had the service when he was a student.
The app, available on computers and smart devices, allows users to pick out items from local grocery stores to be purchased and delivered by personal shoppers in as little as an hour, with delivery times as fast as 12 minutes. The Instacart app and membership is free, while delivery options range from $3.99 for two-hour delivery to $9.99 for one-hour delivery. Instacart’s grocery delivery service is available in 12 major cities around the U.S., including Los Angeles.
“Our approach is unique compared to others that were some spectacular flameouts,” Mullen said, pointing out that the company uses existing infrastructure to offer same-day delivery.
The company raised $44 million dollars in funding this past June, for a total of $55 million of support to date, according to Forbes.
Mullen, who founded two startups before Instacart, attributes much of his business achievement to his time as a student at USC, where he studied entrepreneurship in the Marshall School of Business.
His interest in business stems from watching his father work in the business world when Mullen was younger.
He lists film professor Drew Casper as a major influence who taught him the components of a good story and the importance of a story arc — skills he uses daily.
“As a founder of a startup, you’re telling your company’s story everyday to a new audience,” Mullen said.
Many of the concepts Mullen says he still finds relevant come from his classes in the entrepreneurship program, where he was able to meet successful business owners, such as the founder of online trading company E*Trade, as well as business owners whom had failed. Hearing about their journeys and learning from their mistakes were valuable educational tools, according to Mullen.
Mullen continues to stay involved with the Trojan family through football and is still in touch with many of the connections he made at USC. “I just interviewed a Trojan today, and I could tell he was a Trojan as he was so strong in certain aspects,” he said.
Mullen advises young entrepreneurs to utilize feasibility analysis, a tool taught in business classes that allows startups to gauge interest in their product idea through calculated surveys.He says beginners should make sure to identify a need or problem that requires addressing before proceeding.
“You don’t need to start a business, to know if a business is going to run,” Mullen said.
Regardless, entering the real world sharing economy, as Instacart is, comes with challenges that companies like ride-sharing Uber and home-sharing Airbnb are quickly finding as they face high-profile lawsuits.
Instacart has avoided hiccups in its two years of operation, which can be attributed to its comprehensive training process for personal shoppers, according to Mullen. Because the shopper-customer interaction is vital, shoppers are well-paid and receive 100 percent of their tips. Mullen said the company looks for a passion for food in their shoppers, an attribute that is relayed in its positive reviews.
Instacart’s Los Angeles city manager Walker Dieckmann said the company environment is unparalleled in his experience.
“The culture they’ve created here is one of solving problems and innovating quickly and proactively,” Dieckmann said. “We are always finding new ways to help our customers, and meet their needs.”
Instacart’s users also cite convenience and ease of use as positives in the use of the app, despite price differences between the stores and the app.
Wall Street Journal reviewer Geoffrey Fowler cited his personal shopper experience as well-intentioned but “they’re not delivery professionals,”nevertheless recommending Instacart as the best service for those who want groceries quickly.
Mullen says the app is popular with moms, families and urban professionals.
“These are people who understand the tradeoff between time and paying for convenience.”
Dieckmann said the company is expanding at a rapid rate, and has added two new cities every six weeks for the past four months. In the future, they hope to add growing numbers of available stores and cities.
“My hope is that the name becomes ubiquitous and synonymous with grocery delivery,” Dieckmann said.
Los Angeles area users should look out for major expansion early September with two local favorite chains, as well as added zones of delivery.

Senior cornerback/safety Josh Shaw proved deserving of his title of co-captain this weekend, but at quite a cost.
Just hours after being named one of six team captains at the annual Salute to Troy on Saturday night, Shaw sidelined himself indefinitely by sustaining two high ankle sprains.
The Palmdale, California native was attending a family function at his cousin’s apartment when he saw his 7-year-old nephew Carter struggling in the pool, unable to swim. Shaw jumped down from a second-story balcony and landed on the concrete, spraining both of his ankles before crawling into the pool and dragging his nephew out.
Shaw, who transferred to USC from Florida in 2012, remained humble about the event and positive about the rehabilitation process that lies ahead.
“I would do it again for whatever kid it was, it did not have to be my nephew,” Shaw told USCTrojans.com. “My ankles really hurt, but I am lucky to be surrounded by the best trainers and doctors in the world. I am taking my rehab one day at a time, and I hope to be back on the field soon.”
Despite being disappointed about losing Shaw indefinitely, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian praised Shaw’s character.
“That was a heroic act by Josh, putting his personal safety aside,” Sarkisian said. “But that’s the kind of person he is. It is unfortunate that he’ll be sidelined for a while and we will miss his leadership and play, but I know he’ll be working hard to get back on the field as soon as possible.”
Indeed, the Trojans will miss the versatile defensive back. In 14 games last year, Shaw recorded 67 total tackles and four interceptions. High ankle sprains typically take around six weeks to heal.
Shaw has been open about dealing with adversity in the past. At USC’s student-athlete graduation in May, Shaw told the story of transferring to USC to be closer to his ailing grandfather and to help with the family business.
“Life doesn’t always work out the way you planned,” Shaw said. “When and perhaps if you are met with challenges, my fellow graduates, don’t give up. Never accept no for an answer, for we are Trojans.”

A valiant effort from the USC women’s soccer team came up just short of victory on Sunday night, as the team settled for a 1-1 draw against the University of San Diego Toreros in San Diego. The overtime result, which came on the heels of Friday’s 1-0 win over Long Beach State, leaves the team unbeaten through its first two games for the third consecutive year.
Strike a pose · Junior striker Megan Borman netted her first goal of the season in Sunday’s draw at San Diego. Borman has four career scores. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
USC’s only scorer was junior forward Megan Borman, who picked up her fourth career goal in the 24th minute. Her squad’s lead would not last long, however, as the Toreros’ Rachel Conners equalized just eight minutes later. Both teams created multiple scoring chances through the rest of regulation and into two tense extra periods, but no one was able to find the back of the net.
Even with a second straight victory so close, USC’s first-year head coach Keidane McAlpine was pleased with his team.
“I thought we played much better,” McAlpine told USC Trojans. “The team played with great energy and created excellent chances.”
The first of those chances came in just the 16th minute, when junior forward Katie Johnson was able to get a shot off within USD’s penalty area. The Torero defense deflected the shot and snuffed out USC’s scoring opportunity, which went on to become a theme of the match. The Women of Troy finished play with 13 shots, including eight in the game’s final 65 minutes, compared to just six shots for their opponents.
The Toreros’ one defensive breakdown started with a run from USC junior midfielder Reilly Parker, whose cross from the left end line found Johnson in the box. When Johnson’s attempt was once again blocked, Borman was able to find the ball and sneak it past USD goalkeeper Michelle Craft.
The Women of Troy nearly doubled their lead in the 29th minute, as a terrific corner kick from junior midfielder Jamie Fink made its way to the seemingly magnetic Borman. Once again, however, Craft was too tough to beat and the match remained 1-0.
That score held for another three minutes, when Conners delivered a beautiful long-distance strike to the top corner of the USC goal. Senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley, who has delivered clean sheets in five of six periods on the year, could do little to stop the shot.
The Women of Troy’s last chance to retake the lead in the first half came from another top-notch Fink corner in the 41st minute, but Craft was able to get her hands on freshman midfielder Nicole Molen’s headed effort.
USC continued to move the ball well in the second half, and once again found itself in position to take the lead. Borman’s rebound shot from a Parker corner in the 54th minute went wide of the net, followed quickly by a shot on goal from sophomore forward Savannah Levin that Craft was able to save. Minutes later, Craft acrobatically tipped a brilliant long-distance shot from Borman over the crossbar.
In perhaps  the Women of Troy’s best second-half opportunity to take the lead, a 90th-minute corner kick from Parker connected with a leaping Borman. Her header, one of a team-leading six total shots in the match, struck the crossbar and bounced harmlessly away.
The first sudden-death overtime period brought no golden goal, nor any offensive opportunities. USC’s lone shot came from Parker but  went wide, and a stout defense held the Toreros to a single shot as well.
The second overtime turned out similarly, with both teams worn out from three periods of high-energy play. The Women of Troy’s defense buckled without breaking, withstanding several corner kicks from a resilient Torero attack. USC’s lone shot of the final period, from freshman forward Sydney Johnson, was corraled wide of the net.
With so many missed opportunities, McAlpine could have been frustrated, but he recognized the toughness of the Torero defense.
“You have to give San Diego a lot of credit,” McAlpine told USC Trojans. “They brought a lot of energy to the game. However, I thought we did enough to win.”
The squad’s next opportunity for a win will come at the Notre Dame Adidas Invitational in South Bend, Indiana this weekend, where it will match up with host Notre Dame and Iowa State. The Women of Troy will then return home to McAlister Field for their first home game of the season against UC Riverside next Friday.

UPDATE: This column ran in the Aug. 26 print edition of the Daily Trojan, prior to the development of new information regarding senior cornerback Josh Shaw’s injury. For up-to-the-minute information on the developing story, please click here and subscribe to the Daily Trojan Twitter account (@DailyTrojan).
When news broke that senior cornerback Josh Shaw suffered two high ankle sprains after saving his nephew, my first reaction was, admittedly, a bit selfish. “Oh, hell no.” Because let’s be real: Nickell Robey isn’t walking through that door. The Trojans have a legitimate monster at safety in sophomore Su’a Cravens, but Shaw’s potential at cornerback was intriguing and the Florida transfer was turning heads with his play late last season. High ankle sprains don’t have the most encouraging prognoses, and Shaw could miss a large, important chunk of what was supposed to be a potential playoff berth season.
Shaw should not be blamed for his heroic action, but the Trojans will face some of its stiffest competition in the early going. The Trojans will face Stanford in week two, Oregon State in week four and pass-happy Taylor Kelly and the ASU Sun Devils in week five.
Shaw’s experience was a major factor in the upset of Stanford last season and his interception in the second quarter against Oregon State at the Trojans’ 16-yard line prevented a would-be scoring drive for the Beavers and shifted the momentum of the game completely in the Trojans’ favor.
Let’s not forget that Shaw was a potential NFL Draft prospect, going into a make-or-break season for his draft stock that could have put him in contention for a roster spot at the professional level. This season was to be his litmus test, a way to more firmly entrench him in the minds of scouts as a corner who can use his physicality and ball skills to overcome any shortcomings in his quickness.
Which is why my second reaction to the news of Shaw spraining his ankle was mostly sadness. He will be known as the player who sacrificed his final season of eligibility because he had to save his nephew from drowning.
It’s impossible to blame Shaw for saving his nephew and forgetting himself for a brief moment — after all, most decent human beings faced with the situation would have done the same thing. There was no time for Shaw to perform a cost-benefit analysis of saving his nephew, or to gauge the risk of injury. He simply knew the right thing to do and did it.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian testified to Shaw’s character, calling the rescue effort a “heroic act” and saying “that’s the kind of person [Shaw] is.” Shaw told ESPN that he wouldn’t have done anything differently.
Shaw initially transferred from a BCS bowl-contending Florida team to Los Angeles on a hardship waiver. In an interview with Rivals.com, Shaw explained that his grandfather’s failing health wasn’t his only reason for transferring to USC — his father was about to go undergo reconstructive knee surgery while working two jobs to support the family.
“He’s helping out with my grandparents’ house and his own house, so if he can’t work, it really affects the family,” Shaw told Rivals.com in 2012. “It means we could end up losing our house. So I had to come home and help out with the family business in the meantime.”
After returning home to Palmdale, California, Shaw had to choose between two schools: UCLA and USC. It’s a testament to the recruiting efforts of former Tennessee offensive line coach and current USC offensive line coach James Cregg that Shaw was pulled from clutches of that other school across town to ensure he suited up for USC.
Call me cheesy, but it feels like Shaw was fated to be a Trojan. His commitment and extraordinary loyalty to his family manifested not once, but twice in very public situations. His absence this season is a severe blow to an already thin USC secondary, but the Trojan faithful should instead take heart. 
A man dedicated to his family, putting others above himself and fighting on through rehab in the face of significant adversity despite sustaining an injury is not just the making of an inspiring viral story.  It’s the actions of a man who just set an example for the entire Trojan community. Josh Shaw chose USC and never looked back — and I, as a member of the Trojan family, cannot be more proud to be in his company.

The first football practice of the 2014 school year is over for USC as the Trojans inch closer to their first game of the season. The 15th-ranked Trojans are prepping for the unranked Fresno State Bulldogs, whom they defeated 45-20 in last year’s Las Vegas Bowl.
In good hands · Junior wideout Nelson Agholor will be one of six co-captains for USC this season. Agholor led the Trojans with 918 receiving yards and six touchdowns while starting every game in 2013. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Call upon your captains
The Trojans made history this weekend by electing six co-captains for the 2014 season, the most the team has ever had.
Junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor, junior quarterback Cody Kessler, senior linebacker Hayes Pullard, senior cornerback/safety Josh Shaw, junior center Max Tuerk and junior defensive end Leonard Williams were voted as captains by their teammates.
Pullard, USC’s leading tackler in 2013, will serve as the only returning captain on a squad that has seen a great deal of turmoil in the past year. The Inglewood, California native was one of the most decorated Trojans during this preseason, earning nods to the watchlists for the Nagurski Trophy (top defensive player), the Bednarik Award (top defensive player), the Lott IMPACT Trophy (top defensive impact player), the Lombardi Award (top lineman or linebacker) and the Butkus Award (top linebacker).
Last season, Pullard was joined by wide receiver Marqise Lee, center Marcus Martin and linebacker Devon Kennard, all since selected in the 2014 NFL Draft, as the team captains. It was the first time since 2009 that a quarterback was not among the captains.
Kessler, entering his first full year as a starter in 2014, made sure that wasn’t the case this season.
Williams praised Kessler’s newfound confidence and leadership when the pair represented USC at Pac-12 Media Day this summer.
“He’s been a great leader so far,” Williams said. “He’s all in for it on the team and he’s ready to put his heart out there for it.”
Williams, who played the entire 2013 season with a torn labrum in his right shoulder, will also serve as a team leader this year, a role he says he has had to grow into.
“I guess I could say I’m a natural leader, but I’m more by example, just working hard, showing people what to do the right way,” Williams said. “But I’m not much of a vocal leader, I don’t like to hawk on guys if they’re doing something wrong, I’d just rather they see me doing it right and follow my footsteps.”
Depth chart released
On Sunday, Sarkisian released his first official depth chart of the 2014 season.
If it holds, Saturday will mark the first time in USC’s history that two true freshman guards will start an opening game.
Toa Lobendahn and Damien Mama currently sit atop the depth chart at the left and right guard positions, respectively.
“They’re going to go out and play really good football for us,” Sarkisian said of the freshmen. “Are they perfect? No, they’re going to make some mistakes. But the goal is that they gradually get better as the season continues to go on and they play their best football in November.”
The offensive line has seen many changes in the last year, as redshirt sophomore Chad Wheeler is the only player anticipated to start the same position he played last year (left tackle). Tuerk started 13 games at left tackle last year and one at right tackle, but will now serve as the starting center following Martin’s departure.
Redshirt junior Zach Banner managed to fight his way into the starting spot at right tackle. Banner appeared in only two games last season before suffering a season-ending injury that required surgery on both hips.
Other than Lobendahn and Mama, the only freshman slated to start this weekend is wide receiver Ajene Harris. Harris, who prepped at Crenshaw High, will start across from Agholor at the wideout position. Sophomore Darreus Rogers was expected to start, but is listed behind Agholor on the depth chart.
Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, USC’s breakout star in 2013, is listed atop the running back ladder. Allen led the team with 785 yards and 14 touchdowns last year, noticeably improving under the tutelage of interim head coach Ed Orgeron.
Redshirt junior Tre Madden will likely be a game-time decision on Saturday after missing the last few practices with turf toe. Madden missed three games last year with a hamstring injury after missing the entire 2012 season with a knee injury. Despite only playing in 11 games last year, Madden led the Trojans in carries and put up 703 yards.
There were fewer surprises on the defensive side of the ball — the only real question was who would earn the starting outside linebacker spot following redshirt sophomore Jabari Ruffin’s season-ending injury in camp. Redshirt sophomore Scott Felix (formerly Scott Starr before legally changing his last name) earned that honor.
Redshirt junior Antwaun Woods earned the nod at nose tackle, which Williams said was a position up for grabs between the defensive linemen. Williams seems confident in Woods’ abilities.
“[He’s] a phenomenal player and guy,” Williams said. “He’s a great leader this year and he’s gonna step up big time.”
Quick hits
Sarkisian will hold practice at 8 a.m. throughout the season rather than in the afternoons like last year. Sarkisian believes that this schedule helps the student athletes be more productive both on and off the field.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden was hospitalized this weekend and missed Saturday night’s Salute to Troy as a result. USC Athletics reported that Haden was feeling fine on Sunday.

Nominate a friend, stimulate global awareness and provide a monetary donation — all this for a good cause and some fun? Sounds like a great idea. For most.
Perhaps the question of greater importance is whether the positive outcomes of the ice bucket challenge can outweigh the negative. For this cause, the end does justify the means. Bringing people together through philanthropic deeds is always a notable feat.
Log on to your social media feeds and chances are, there’ll be an influx of videos featuring friends partaking in the “ice bucket challenge.” The challenge is directly affiliated with the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association (ALSA), a nonprofit organization. It hopes to change the way society views ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that progressively debilitates the body’s motor functions, by fostering communal awareness, guidance and research. Once nominated for the challenge, an individual has 24 hours to either pour a bucket of ice water over his or her head or donate $100 to the ALSA.
Critics, however, question the impact that the challenge really makes. Alexandra Petri, a blogger for the Washington Post, titled her most recent article, “Against awareness — I nominate you to NOT take the ALS challenge.” In the article she comically makes light of the contrast between raising awareness and making a tangible difference.  The article, however, fails to acknowledge the financial contributions that significantly aid the association in achieving its various goals including spreading the word, reaching core values and funding further research. Since the challenge began in mid-July, more than $70.2 million have been raised to foster global research and assistance for those affected with the incurable disease. This is a staggering increase in comparison to monetary values received from contributors during the same time frame last year.
In a Slate article titled “Take the ‘No Ice Bucket’ Challenge” Will Oremus suggests that people should not need to participate in the ice bucket challenge but donate monetarily in private. Without the attention placed by social media, however, many would never have done the challenge at all. Though the concept and mechanics of accomplishing the deed might be misconstrued, it is important to note that a large part of the community is coming together to participate for a good cause. Using social media as a tool for good opens the doors for future generations to use their available resources for positive causes, generating a communal desire and interest to make viable change. Giving individuals the chance to partake in public acts of kindness allows others to mirror their actions. Individuals have come together to work for one cause.
Though the challenge might be labeled as a fad, its results in a short period of time reveal something unique about this generation — a willingness and desire to support others in need. It’s true that some participants don’t know exactly what ALS stands for, but their choice to fight a common enemy is something of value.
As a society, it is important to realize that generational changes are imperfect. Many critics of the challenge have pointed at the idleness of youth for not donating to the challenge and, instead, choosing to dump water over their heads. But that’s the premise of the challenge itself — to promote a worthy cause, society must stand together.

Late July marked the emergence of the now-worldwide phenomenon, the ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) Association’s “ice bucket challenge.” Though the numbers might point to a win for the 30,000 suffering from ALS, there are many consequences ignored by the public, most notably insincere activism that does little to promote awareness through education.
The origin of the challenge remains foggy. Various sources report different beginnings, but the current significance remains clear — to raise awareness for a debilitating disease that diminishes muscle movement due to motor neuron degeneration. Those who accept the challenge douse themselves in icy water (hence the challenge’s name) and nominate others, who have 24 hours to complete the dare. Those who fail to carry out the challenge are supposed to donate to the ALSA. This freezing philanthropic phenomenon has reached $70.2 million in donations, according to statistics released by the ALSA on Aug. 24.
The challenge’s magnetism, powered by social media, lies in the fact that everyone can get involved — the participants are not just celebrities with large fan bases. It is, however, unsettling that good deeds have to be documented and broadcast for the world to see. Social media platforms are generally superficial, decorated with pictures and posts of highlights, skipping over the low points — this is a result of the ability to self-publish. In terms of the ice bucket challenge, altruism is “seen as a badge of honor,” according to Greg Cash, communications director for the ALSA. This type of insincere activism is known as “slacktivism,” or being part of something just for the sake of it. So, in actuality, the ice bucket challenge proves the power of social media rather than the sincerity and generosity of the public.
As the challenge takes the world by storm, simultaneously proving Kevin Bacon’s theory of six degrees of separation, people have refrained from even mentioning ALS and what it is, going straight to dumping the ice bucket over their heads and nominating their friends. Celebrities such as Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have only reinforced their social media presence, failing to educate their millions of fans about the disease.
Awareness stems from education, not association of the disease with a certain fad. It would be more responsible for participants to teach their audience about how the disease affects the suffering, or better yet, how their donations are being used to combat the disease.
The challenge has collected millions of dollars for one specific disease, but there are countless other organizations out there working to demolish other diseases that deserve just as much attention. Choosing which disease or cause to support should be based on personal values; important causes range from ALS to anti-bullying to poverty. Donating just to fit in, however, is irresponsible.
The challenge has not only detracted attention from other organizations that need the devotion that ALS is receiving right now, but also left out the primary purpose behind raising these funds. The main key is to educate—not solely to dump a bucket of ice water over your head.
