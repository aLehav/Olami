USC’s all-time career saves leader, five-time MPSF Player of the Week winner and 2016 summer Olympian: Those are just some of the many titles held by McQuin Baron, the men’s water polo team’s senior goaltender. 
Yet, despite all the accomplishments that he has achieved throughout his years in the pool, water polo wasn’t always what he wanted to do. In fact, it wasn’t even his favorite sport when he was younger.
“My dad played basketball in college and my mom played soccer and tennis,” Baron said. “I was super into soccer and basketball just because that is what my parents had played.”
While neither of his parents had played water polo, one of his older brothers played for the SoCal Water Polo club team near his hometown of North Tustin, Calif. It wasn’t until Baron went with his mom to pick his brother up from practice one day that someone got him into the pool.
 “When I was like 7 or 8 years old … our family friend was the head coach,” Baron said. “He kinda just tossed me in there with my brother. My brother was a goalie, so I was automatically the goalie. Honestly, ever since then, it just stuck.”
From then on, Baron began playing water polo, yet continued to play soccer, basketball and baseball throughout middle school. It wasn’t until high school that he finally decided to focus on water polo.
“I didn’t really want to play any other sport once I got there,” Baron said. “It was an addicting sport for me once I got to that level.”
Anyone who has grown up in Southern California knows that Mater Dei High School is an athletics powerhouse. Baron even recalled at one point during his time there that the school took a whole week off because so many teams had won their championships, which earned a day off of school each. It was only natural that Baron chose Mater Dei, even though his brothers had played sports at its rival, Orange Lutheran High School.
“I loved it,” Baron said. “We had a 111-game win streak throughout my career [and] I won three of four championships there.”
Baron’s looks back on Mater Dei as a sort of mini-college. He felt it was the best transition into playing water polo for USC that he could have asked for with the positive experience that he had and the people he met throughout his time there. 
However, coming to USC still was a huge transition that created a lot of pressure to do well and a tough, competitive environment that was different from the one at his high school.
“Goalie is a hard position,” Baron said. “If you win a game, it usually is on the guy who scored the most goals, but if you lose a game, it is usually on your goalie. So, losing a game and then being a 17-year-old goalie for such a high-profile team … it was a difficult transition especially coming from a senior in high school where you are the oldest at the level and you hit your prime and then are back at the bottom when you come to college.”
From coming in as a freshman to playing in his final season this year, Baron feels he has grown. He especially feels that playing for one of his coaches at USC who he has had all four years, Marko Pintaric as well as the national team has helped mold him into the player he is today.
Even with everything he has learned and how far he has come as a player, Baron is not satisfied just yet. Having never won a championship here at USC, he and the other seniors feel as if they have something left to finish before they can leave.
“We don’t want to leave here without leaving our mark on this program and leaving some type of legacy,” Baron said. “Especially coming from a team that had won six straight titles coming into our freshman year.”
With the end of the season rapidly approaching, Baron is focusing on his goal to leave behind yet another legacy with his teammates by winning the national championship. At 18-1 on the season so far, the Trojans are proving they are a strong force in the pool, but they are not going to let off the gas until that trophy is theirs. Baron also has another achievement on his radar. He is just 95 saves shy of the current holder of the MPSF all-time saves, Alex Malkis. 
By the end of this season, two more titles could be added to his already impressive list. But by then, Baron will have already turned his eyes toward the next thing on his to-do list — an Olympic gold medal.

Being frank, I thought USC looked its worst this season during last Saturday’s 38-10 win over Oregon State. The stats on the surface were strong: a four-touchdown cushion, 316 passing yards (three scores) for redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold and more than 500 yards of total offense. But the Beavers are a team in shambles right now. Even when facing a turnover-prone offense and toothless defense, the Trojans did their best to support their opponent’s upset bid early on, with sloppy play and multiple bone-headed turnovers, including a poorly read interception from Darnold, an inexplicable no-contact fumble and a muffed punt from junior cornerback Ajene Harris.
Still, a win is a win — a 28-point win at that. No harm, no foul. An injury-ravaged USC roster managed to avoid more trouble against Oregon State (save what appears to be a minor toe issue for junior wideout Deontay Burnett), and inexperienced players who were asked to step into key roles logged valuable reps heading into a make-or-break second half of the season. In particular, true freshman Andrew Vorhees made his first career start last Saturday at right guard, and redshirt sophomore Clayton Johnston manned right tackle. With redshirt senior Viane Talamaivao out for the season and almost every other regular starter on the Trojans’ line nursing injuries throughout the fall, the unproven duo of Vorhees and Johnston will have to be trusted in big moments down the stretch.
But most importantly, staying the course as a one-loss team was massive for the Trojans in view of the rankings shakeup we saw last weekend, when previously undefeated Oklahoma, Michigan and Utah all lost for the first time. No. 13 USC may remain an unconvincing on-field product, but it is still well-positioned for a berth in the College Football Playoff if the team can get healthy and find an offensive spark.
I wouldn’t blame you for dismissing me as a hopeless optimist. Plenty have already bailed on the Trojans’ season, at least in terms of playoff hopes, and it’s hard to argue that this squad has played like a top-four program through its opening six weeks. But just look: USC welcomes Utah to the Coliseum this weekend, and since the Trojans and Utes are the only one-loss teams left in the Pac-12 South, a victory would put USC in clear pole position in the division. In other words, Darnold and company still control their own destiny in the conference — and if they grab the Pac-12 crown with only a single blemish on their record, it would be hard to keep them out of the playoff discussion.
Then again, I suppose you already knew that. Trojan fans’ plummeting confidence doesn’t come from the team’s record; it comes from what they have seen on the field. Even if USC somehow makes it to Santa Clara next month, could it triumph against Washington or in a rematch with Washington State?
Moreover, can the Trojans beat Utah this week? Vegas favors them by 12.5 points, but as usual, you’d expect the game to be much closer than that (USC has only covered the spread once this season, against Stanford). After the Beavers brought a bottom-25 defense to the Coliseum last Saturday, the Utes will arrive with the No. 21 total defense in the country. They hold opposing quarterbacks to the seventh-lowest passer rating among 129 FBS programs, and they are also stout against the run, sitting in the top 25. For all the much-deserved praise defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast has received for his ball-hawking unit, USC’s defense ranks behind Utah in almost all categories, and while the Trojans have forced 15 turnovers this year (fifth in the FBS), Utah has forced just one fewer. That doesn’t bode well for Darnold, who individually averages nearly two giveaways per game.
Nothing bodes well for USC this weekend, actually. The Utes will arrive confident and hungry as underdogs. On the other side, the Trojans have already played six consecutive weeks of high-pressure football (with a trip to South Bend looming next Saturday) while Utah enjoyed a bye just two weeks ago. Physically, the visitors could have a significant leg up, and the opponent could hold that edge against USC in every game from now until the end of the regular season.
So what can the Trojans do to overcome their disadvantage? How can they reestablish themselves as a legitimate championship contender? Honestly, I don’t know. If the answer were clear, we wouldn’t be debating every aspect of this team from personnel to play-calling halfway through the season. Darnold — as much as many hoped — is not a one-man solution, and there is no immediate cure for injuries or the inexperience that has been exposed as a result.
But as a season comes under threat, perspective sets in. Redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins and senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu are playing their final collegiate seasons — and perhaps USC’s other two captains, Darnold and junior linebacker Cam Smith, are as well. After overcoming two knee surgeries as a Trojan, redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. is also playing for one last shot at glory. It may be among the biggest sports cliches, but perhaps USC will begin to play for its seniors, for the men who might not be back in the locker room next fall. After all, this was supposed to be the year it all came together.
The season is still very much alive, too. Once again, despite all the doom and gloom, the Trojans control their own destiny. Let’s see if they can fulfill it.

The Rossier School of Education launched its newest research center, the Center for Empowered Learning and Development with Technology, in September 2017 to study techniques that may improve the learning experiences of underrepresented students by integrating technology into specific fields.
Brendesha Tynes, an associate professor of education and psychology at Rossier, is the founding director of the center and has been conducting research since 2001 on young people’s experiences online and how they relate to their academic performance and mental health.
“As I developed as a researcher, I started to think about ways that I could ultimately impact what was happening in schools,” said Tynes, who found the lack of diversity in tech companies troubling. “If we’ve been doing research in schools for all these years, why hasn’t there been any change in the percentage of people of color … that these companies are hiring?”
Tynes came to USC in 2012 hoping to start a center that would focus on technology and its relationship to the education of students of color. The center was launched this year with Stephen Aguilar, a postdoctoral fellow, as its associate director and Ashley Stewart, a doctoral candidate in philosophy, as its project manager.
Along with Aguilar and Stewart, Tynes assembled a team of researchers with diverse areas of expertise but all possessing knowledge of the histories and cultures of minorities. 
“We want people who have been in these communities for years and studied them and continue to study the research that’s coming out of these populations,” Tynes said. “That’s the only way we’re gonna do research that’s … innovative and rigorous.”
The center aims to study and improve equity in technology education for students of color. Researchers will work to examine how students use technology both inside and outside of the classroom and how this relates to their educational experience. 
“We really want to be able to tell teachers and tell educators how they should be engaging students, particularly students of color and students in urban populations, around technology use and media use,” Stewart said.
The first project that the center is working on is a media literacy app that will help students critically analyze messages that they see in the media. The center will also continue working on a project that analyzes computer science classrooms to tell educators the best way to teach minorities. 
In the future, the center hopes to look further into how adolescents’ use of the internet affects their mental health and views on education. 
“We’re recognizing that technology, social media, is a double-edged sword,” said Rossier Dean Karen Symms Gallagher. “We need to understand, particularly on young people, the effect of cyberbullying.”
These various projects look to ultimately assist educators teaching students of color about technology with the hopes of increasing equity in education and diversity in the tech industry. According to a 2014 report by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 68.5 percent of high tech industry participants in the U.S. are white.
This is a statistic that many centers at Rossier are attempting to change. 
“Our mission is to improve learning … and understand the ways in which equitable teaching, assessments and so on affect individuals students as well as schools and other systems,” Gallagher said.
These professors of SJWism are just spinning their wheels. Two words: Thomas Sowell.

Karen Lincoln’s work serves as a voice for marginalized groups in health studies and challenges. As an associate professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the founder of Advocates for African American Elders, Lincoln focuses on the disparities in health conditions, especially in Alzheimer’s disease, among the older African American population in her research.
Lincoln was recently featured on a list of top 50 influencers in aging for 2017 by Next Avenue, a publication that focuses exclusively on issues for individuals 50 and older. Currently, Lincoln has shifted her focus to the effects of Alzheimer’s disease on black communities. 
“African Americans have the highest burden and the highest risk of any other racial ethnicity in the country [for Alzheimer’s],” Lincoln said. “My work focuses on increasing access to information and education for [this demographic] — middle age and also adults — to help address that disparity.”
The AAE program Lincoln founded emphasizes health care and health information access in the African American community, especially among the elderly. The program operates primarily in South Los Angeles, where 38 percent of its residents are black, according to the Los Angeles Times’ Mapping L.A. data.
Since there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, Lincoln stressed the importance of prevention alongside treatment. Although African Americans have two to three times the risk of developing the disease compared to whites, researchers tend to focus on diseases like diabetes and hypertension among the community instead, According to Lincoln. Therefore, Lincoln advocates for awareness and education on Alzheimer’s disease to the public.
“There are various studies going around [USC] campus — there’s my work, but we need to make sure people have access to this information,” Lincoln said. “For students who might think Alzheimer’s disease only affects older adults … I think it’s very important for all of us to know … the risk starts when you’re very young. Research shows it can start as young as 10 years old.”
In her career, Lincoln’s interest in health and aging was piqued when she was a student at the University of Michigan because of her mentor’s work in those fields. She then moved to Seattle to work on the mayor’s task force advising him on the older African American population and their needs.
“I was chairing a council on African American elders … and advocating for social services for that population,” Lincoln said. “As a result of that, we established a program called the African American Elders Program, [serving] very low income, homebound, frail older adults.”
Lincoln began her work in gerontology at a young age, and she advised students to educate themselves on these diseases, even if they appear far-fetched, affecting only older individuals.
“It’s very important for us to think, as young people, about the risk factor and the prevention factor associated with any type of brain disease,” she said. “Alzheimer’s disease — there’s no cure, and it’s almost like an epidemic among African Americans. The more we can educate ourselves and share information with others, whether that be our parents, grandparents or people in our network, the better off we will all be to prevent this type of disease.”
Lincoln received her Ph.D. in sociology and social work at the University of Michigan and began her work in advocacy at her first academic appointment at the University of Washington, where she worked with the mayor to create a program for the elderly.
However, Lincoln said the Advocates for African American Elders program in Los Angeles is her most fulfilling work. The impact is direct and largely beneficial for the local community, she said. 
“It’s a wonderful partnership between USC, the School of Social Work and the community of Los Angeles — doing this kind of work and sharing information,” Lincoln said. “I think it reaches the community a lot faster than if we considered a traditional approach.”

Professor Viet Thanh Nguyen was selected as a 2017 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, the MacArthur Foundation announced on Wednesday. Nguyen’s work was chosen for calling into question how the Vietnam War is depicted in popular media and for exploring how the war still affects many individuals today, the foundation’s website said. 
The MacArthur Fellowship is a $625,000 grant that recipients can use without restrictions, and is intended to invest in the potential of individuals with “exceptional creativity” in their work, according to the foundation website. 
One of the criteria for the MacArthur Fellowship, according to its website, is based on a track record of previous accomplishments. 
In 2016, Nguyen won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his debut novel The Sympathizer, which explored the Vietnam War as seen through the conflicted eyes of an American-educated Viet Cong spy. His subsequent books, the non-fictional Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War and short story collection The Refugees, have similarly been critically acclaimed works.
Nguyen was also named a Guggenheim fellow in April 2017, a similar grant given to individuals with exceptional creative ability in the arts. Nguyen won his award in the field of fiction.
At USC, Nguyen is the Aerol Arnold Chair of English and a professor of American studies and ethnicity. He also serves on the steering committee for the Center for Transpacific Studies. In 2013, Nguyen was awarded the Provost’s Prize for Teaching with Technology for a course in which he and his students created “Another War Memorial,” an online set of profiles about individuals involved in the Vietnam War that challenge conventional ideas of what a war memorial is. 
Nguyen will be using part of his award money to help support diaCRITICS, a blog that focuses on arts, culture and politics of Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora, according to USC News. 
“I always recognize that there’s been a need to have to that space for diversity of Vietnamese voices and that is what I will use some of the money for,” Nguyen told USC News.

In response to the destruction caused by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria, as well as the earthquakes that struck Mexico during the past few months, the USC Viterbi Office of Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship’s annual Min Family Engineering Social Entrepreneurship Challenge will focus on creating prototypes that target natural disaster relief for 2018. 
Established by alumnus Bryan Min and his wife Julie, the Min Family Challenge finds engineering solutions for societal problems through a student competition. Since late 2015, the competition has addressed issues related to poverty, the environment or health care — by bringing in students who serve as social engineers to develop technological solutions. 
“Our students are an incredible resource and possess an enormous amount of energy and talent,” Vice Dean of Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Andrea Belz said in a press release. “This year’s challenge will apply their intellect and skill towards helping people who have immediate needs. This challenge will provide an unforgettable learning experience in conceiving of real-world solutions to improve lives of others.”
The challenge will kick off in November 2017, and teams of student engineers will have the opportunity to travel to Houston — which was recently impacted by Hurricane Harvey — for field research starting in the first week of January.  After identifying a specific problem in the community resulting from the summer storms, the participants will work on designing the solution. 
Additionally, the students will attend six 90-minute workshops hosted by USC Viterbi’s Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Office and USC Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab. 
These workshops will go over a range of topics, covering the basics of social entrepreneurship and customer discovery. 
Over the following months, the teams will generate prototypes and business models for these solutions, and on March 28, the finalists will be featured in a showcase, where the winner of the challenge will be presented.
Projects in the past have included OptDx, a software that helps prevent blindness in premature babies through an automatic screening process, and 2016 winner FlexSpecs, which generated cost-friendly glasses with lenses that changed their shape and power with a touch of a dial. 
Though the challenge has normally focused on serving those in need across the globe, the upcoming year’s theme will center on enhancing relief and recovery efforts in communities that were left devastated from recent natural disasters. 
“This is the first year the challenge is focused on natural disaster relief,” said Alice Liu, Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Office assistant director. “And not just immediate relief, but the process of relief, recovery and rebuilding for the overall communities and the victims of these communities.”
Liu served as the game architect behind the challenge. By detailing more specific rules to the challenge that were tailored to the type of innovation the creators want to see, Liu was able to shape the theme of the 2018 challenge and set the guidelines for the participants when it comes to their prototypes.

Former USC linebacker Osa Masina pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual battery at Utah’s Third District Court on Thursday. 
Masina accepted a plea deal that allows him to avoid trial and prison time. He originally faced one count of first-degree felony rape and two counts of forced sodomy in September 2016, which could have amounted to a life sentence in prison if he was found guilty. The plea agreement reduced Masina’s charges to sexual battery, which is a class A misdemeanor, the highest class. 
 Masina and former linebacker Don Hill were suspended from the football team in September of 2016 amid an investigation into the sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman. Neither Hill nor Masina were criminally prosecuted in Los Angeles for the incident, in which the alleged victim claimed the men forced intercourse upon her. 
The Los Angeles District Attorney decided not to pursue the charges, after deciding that there was insufficient evidence to prove the woman was unable to consent. 
However, Masina was later charged in Salt Lake City for another assault case involving the same alleged victim mentioned in the Los Angeles investigation. The woman and Masina reportedly attended a party in Salt Lake City where the assault took place. She alleged that she was intoxicated, fell asleep and woke up to Masina raping her.
Masina will not have to register as a sex offender since he has fewer than four charges of sexual battery against him, court officials said. Masina could face up to one year of jail time for each charge, and his sentencing will take place in 45 to 60 days.
Masina was suspended from USC in September 2016 and is no longer a student at USC, University officials said on Thursday.
