The University announced in a November USC News article that it prevented 32 tons of plastic, or the equivalent of one million bottles, from being sent into landfills. 
The ban on single-use bottles marks a milestone for USC’s “aggressive” sustainability framework called “Assignment: Earth.” The plan states the University’s mission to reach carbon neutrality by 2025 and zero waste by 2028. To reach the latter goal, the University introduced its elimination of single-use plastic bottles from all of its campuses at the start of July 2022, a process that involved negotiating with The Coca-Cola Company to only supply non-plastic products, placing more hydration stations around the campuses and removing plastic bottles from vending machines and selling points — such as those at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
The results of these efforts have left Ellen Dux, the associate director of USC’s Office of Sustainability, “over the moon” with what she considers to be “such a huge win” for the University.
“To think that in just a couple months’ time with a lot of hard work on behalf of the whole Trojan community, [where] everybody is doing their part to make this win happen, that we could take a million bottles out of that slipstream is incredible,” Dux said.
For Isabella Pangilinan, a junior majoring in environmental studies and member of the Environmental Student Assembly, the change in policy has been noticeable — especially in stores on campus where single-use plastic packing for beverages has been replaced with aluminum cans.
“I think in the past few years, USC has really done a lot in terms of sustainability, especially with the inauguration of President Carol Folt … sustainability was one of her top priorities,” Pangalinan said.
Dux said she agrees with Pangilinan’s assessment of Folt, saying that the President is being an “enormous champion” for sustainability at USC.
“I recall very clearly when she first came to USC before COVID even started and was [not] talking about low-hanging fruit or quick wins because they were all going to be big lifts … one of the first ones was [that] we’ve got to get a hold of plastic,” Dux said.
Plastic has lower reuse rates than aluminum, so the metal has been heralded by environmentalists as a greener alternative. Aluminum cans also create less ocean waste, and recycling plastic is a more complex process, according to Reuters. Cans have 68% recycled content on average compared to just 3% for plastic in the United States. 
Single-use plastics, or disposable plastics, are used most commonly in bottles, wrappers, straws and bags. However, through their energy-intensive manufacturing process and improper disposal, their usage in packaging has come under scrutiny across large global markets. 
The European Union banned all single-use plates and straws, and various states in the U.S. like Connecticut have introduced restrictive legislation. As only 9% of plastic in the U.S. is recycled, single-use plastics continue to create significant ecological destruction because of their non-biodegradable nature.
In an informal survey conducted by the Daily Trojan with 36 random students traveling through McCarthy Quad on Thursday afternoon, all of whom had been at the University for at least a year, two-thirds said they did not notice any change in the use of single-use plastics on campus. 
However, some of the 10 respondents that noticed a reduction in the use of single-use plastics over the last year said they noted changes like compostable containers and coffee cups the University is now serving at Everybody’s Kitchen, and that retailers at the University asked customers whether they wanted plastic cutlery with their purchase go cutlery-free.
For the University to be at the forefront of waste aversion, in a space where universities like UCLA have launched their own zero waste campaigns, Dux says that there will have to be a myriad of one-off deals aside from the one made with The Coca-Cola Company. 
“You will see a lot of schools, much like us, [that] have a zero waste goal out there … a lot of them get to like 60 or 70% waste aversion and then you notice a real [drop-off],” Dux said.
Meanwhile, Dux said that there has been huge progress over the course of a few years. 
“It’s going to take a very concrete roadmap, with all hands on deck, to figure out how we go from that 50% to 90% in the next six years,” Dux said.
Dux said she hopes to see further progress in this direction but said that the use of plastics is not the only way the University is trying to improve its footprint. In its goal to turn itself carbon neutral by 2025 as part of the larger “Assignment: Earth” framework, the University also agreed to a 20-year deal with Los Angeles Department of Water and Power in the fall to obtain 25% of its electricity from solar-generated power from farms in Mojave. Pangilinan said the Office of Sustainability is also setting up a sustainability “hub” for faculty and students in the Student Union. 
“If you look at Assignment: Earth, you’ll see lots of specific programs and initiatives about this but making sure that from the first day, students show up on campus and that we are educating sustainable Trojans to eventually be sustainable global citizens,” Dux said.

The No. 11 Wildcats pounced on the Trojans from the start and never gave up the lead in USC’s 66-81 loss Thursday night. After a pair of victories at Galen Center against Colorado and Utah, the Trojans failed to sustain their momentum in the matchup, the first of a difficult two-game road trip for the Trojans.
In front of a rowdy crowd at the McKale Memorial Center in Tucson, Arizona, USC struggled from the opening tip-off and found itself down 9-2 a little over 3 minutes into the game. Arizona’s experienced forwards Azuolas Tubelis and Oumar Ballo proved to be too much for the Trojans to handle. Tubelis and Ballo combined for 27 points and 24 rebounds, and the Wildcats’ similarly consistent outside shooting put the game out of reach early on. While Arizona shot 28-58 (48.3%) from the field and 12-24 (50.0%) from beyond the arc, USC shot a mere 24-65 (36.9%) from the floor and 4-17 (23.5%) from 3-point range. 
USC Head Coach Andy Enfield chose to start the game in a man-to-man defense, but Arizona’s quick start on offense led him to switch to a zone defense, inadvertently creating space for Arizona’s shooters. Guards Courtney Ramey, Cedric Henderson and Pelle Larsson combined for 42 points, 27 of which were from three-pointers. 
USC needed their more experienced players to step up in a big way in Thursday’s match. Senior guard Boogie Ellis, one of USC’s most consistent scorers so far this season, struggled offensively the entire night. Arizona’s high level of defensive pressure on Ellis led him to shoot just 2-11 from the floor and end the game with 11 points, 2 assists and 4 rebounds. Fifth-year guard Drew Peterson was USC’s leading scorer with 15 points, 2 assists and 7 rebounds.
While the Trojans were outscored 41-26 in the first half, USC cut the lead to just 9 after Ballo was charged with a technical foul a little more than a minute into the second half. Following the foul, Ellis proceeded to score both free throws, which were then succeeded by a much needed three-pointer from sophomore guard Kobe Johnson. However, Arizona’s strong shooting continued over from the first half as Henderson quickly hit back-to-back three pointers to grow the lead to 15 points again. The Wildcats never looked back.
After making his debut as a Trojan against Colorado last week, freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu came off of the bench and played 15 minutes in Thursday’s game, putting up 4 points and securing a rebound. 
Sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters, who typically produces significant stats as the Trojans’ sixth man, also struggled — especially from the 3-point line — and ended the game with 8 points and 4 rebounds. All around the Trojans didn’t have much to show for on offense, and to go along with that the team only shot 67% from the free-throw line on 21 attempts. 
USC also struggled with the amount of mental mistakes that they had, especially through fouls and turnovers. Although USC only had 12 turnovers compared to Arizona’s 18, the Trojans’ turnovers came at times when they were desperate for a basket in to turn the tide of the game. Oftentimes, the Trojans would force unnecessary passes as well as off-ball fouls that gave Arizona even more momentum and opportunities to score.
Though the game highlighted several of USC’s weaknesses, the loss only put the Trojans down one spot in the Pac-12 standings; they now sit in fourth place, only one game away from the top two spots. 
USC will continue Pac-12 play when they face Arizona State in Desert Financial Arena Saturday at 7:00 p.m.

Some 90 interns, residents and fellows in the Los Angeles County + USC residency program receive, on average, $10,000 less in wages and benefits than the approximately 900 other interns working in the next room over. This gap isn’t based on residents’ level of experience or position in the program, but by the employer listed on their paycheck.
Residents in the program — working rotations at Keck Hospital, LAC+USC Medical Center and Cedars Sinai, among several other hospitals — are employed by either L.A. County or the Keck School of Medicine. Those employed by KSOM currently receive fewer pay, fewer health care benefits and a lower housing stipend than their colleagues employed by L.A. County, said Dr. Eduardo Fernandez, a hematology and medical oncology fellow at Keck.
While housestaff employed by L.A. County have long been represented by the Committee of Interns and Residents/Service Employees International Union, KSOM-employed housestaff only voted to unionize under CIR/SEIU in May 2022. In a unanimous vote, housestaff unionized to gain the ability to negotiate a “fair contract,” have a voice in the workplace, and level the wages and benefits offered to housestaff employed by L.A. County and KSOM.
“We work side by side, we do the same job … You still see the same patients, you work at the same places,” Fernandez said. “But because you’re paid by two different sources, and one that’s unionized, one traditionally was not — we didn’t actually have a contract — the pay amount was different and benefits were different.”
KSOM, CIR/SEIU communications specialist Sunyata Altenor said, has historically matched the housing allowances given to housestaff to the amount given by L.A. County. The allowances aim to supplement the cost of housing for residents amid rising housing prices in L.A. and its surrounding regions. This past year, Altenor said, the allowances weren’t matched: L.A. County paid out $10,000 housing stipends, while KSOM paid out $6,000 stipends.
“We believe that there is a clear correlation between residents forming a union and the Keck School of Medicine suddenly changing their past practice,” Altenor said.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Thursday, the University, which houses KSOM, wrote that L.A. County-employed housestaff reached a contract after several months of bargaining for improved working conditions and better pay. Following the election of CIR/SEIU to represent KSOM-employed housestaff, “any changes to wages and benefits must be bargained,” the statement read.
The decision to employ certain residents under L.A. County and others under KSOM is “arbitrary,” Fernandez said, as applicants matched to the LAC+USC residency program are assigned to either employer at “random.” In some departments, the majority of residents are employed by KSOM, but most departments are composed of several KSOM-employed residents and a majority of L.A. County-employed residents.
“I don’t think that people would have a problem with it being random, so long as the wages and working conditions were equal,” Altenor said. “That’s what we’re trying to rectify this year.”
Negotiations for a contract between KSOM-employed residents and KSOM began in October following months of management postponing sessions that were expected to start in August, Altenor told the Daily Trojan. The parties are meeting every two weeks, though little movement has been seen on the part of management, she said. In negotiations Dec. 20, housestaff presented economic proposals, to which KSOM has yet to respond.
“We are currently engaged in collective bargaining with the union and are committed to bargaining in good faith,” the University wrote in its statement.
About five KSOM-employed residents and allies distributed fliers outside of Norris Hospital Thursday afternoon to spread awareness of the ongoing contract negotiations and the residents’ concerns about unequal pay and benefits. 
Emma Lantos, an OB-GYN fellow employed by KSOM, said that in negotiations, KSOM has argued against residents’ rights to flier and speak out about the negotiations. The fliers, Lantos said, were aimed at individuals who hold the power to control the negotiations’ outcome.
“We are trying to have a fair contract and we are being silenced in doing that,” Lantos said. “We just wanted to make sure that people knew that that was happening.”

The No. 10 USC men’s volleyball team suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 fifth-set loss in a non-conference away matchup against No. 7-ranked UC Irvine Wednesday night. The loss moved the team to 4-2 in the season. 
 The Trojans went 2-0 against the Anteaters last season, and were looking to re-establish themselves as the superior team to a much-improved Anteater squad. 
Unfortunately for USC, UCI took control early — mixing in tips with their hard hitting to confuse the Trojans. The Trojans fought hard, but the Anteaters were able to win the first set 25-22 and take a 1-0 lead. 
The Trojans bounced back with a narrow 27-25 win in the second set, using a crucial dig from senior libero George Dyer to win the match point and tie the game at one set apiece.  
Overall, Head Coach Jeff Nygaard was pleased with the team’s ability to dig it out against a team that made it tough.
“I thought we passed really good against a really tough serving team,” Nygaard said. 
The theme of comebacks carried over to the third set, where the Trojans went from being down 17-14 to taking a 22-19 lead and eventually winning the set — giving them a 2-1 lead.  
Unfortunately, the comeback kids stalled in the fourth set, as UCI built a big lead and the Trojans couldn’t recover. After a 25-20 set loss, they were left to either regroup and adapt, or suffer a heartbreaking loss. 
The Trojans were unable to recuperate, emerging empty-handed after a few key service errors in the fifth and final set. 
Nygaard said the team looks to clean up those errors in the future. 
“Missing 4 serves in game five, we have to make sure we put those balls in and put the pressure back on them,” Nygaard said. 
The away crowd was deafeningly loud leading up to those crucial service errors, but Nygard didn’t think that hostile environment affected them. 
“I don’t think [the noise] was a factor in it,” Nygaard said. “I personally just saw a couple of tosses that I don’t think were the ones we were looking for, and so we probably just made a decision that we could have made something better on.” 
The Trojans’ valiant effort was led by freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein, who led the team in kills, with 19, and total points, with 21. Klein was quick to credit his success to his teammates. 
“The setting and passing was just great today,” Klein said. “I had a couple of good swings here and there, but my teammates really helped me out.”
However, Nygaard was most impressed with Klein’s proficiency in a skill that doesn’t show up in the stat sheet.  
“He was our best passer,” Nygaard said. “Against that team, he raised the level of his passes, so we had the opportunity to run a good offense.”
The Trojans, who have been on the road all season so far, are eager to return home and play in front of Trojan fans. 
“Getting the opportunity to play in front of all my friends is a great opportunity,” Klein said. 
Nygaard cracked a huge smile when asked about playing at Galen. 
“We’re stoked to see who is in the crowd supporting us,” Nygaard said. “Can’t wait to be back in the Trojan land. Fight on!”
The Trojans will look to bounce back against CSUN in Northridge next Wednesday at 7 p.m.

As I wrap up my senior year of college and face a schoolless future for the first time since I played with toy race cars, I feel like I’m halfway through a 150-lap race. My car is neck and neck with the other racers. I’m cruising by people or being passed by them, all going a moderate 60 miles an hour — and just 30 around the curves. 
I clearly have my own, slow-paced but highly tactical race to finish. But so does the roster of NASCAR drivers set to take on the Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum in early February.
In February 2022, nearly 60,000 people took to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for NASCAR’s debut on the West Coast. I was among them, a NASCAR newcomer with blue jeans on and any thought to bring earplugs off.
And, oh boy, was it loud. The 23 race cars and their souped-up engines did a number on my uncovered ears, causing them to ring infinitely louder than after any concert or sporting event I had attended before. The compact Coliseum hugged the small track where engines that wanted to go three times as fast roared in outcry.
Cry is what I tried not to do as my buddy Ben and I watched the drivers at their craft. It was electrifying and mesmerizing but also way too many laps to put my poor ears through — ears that, because I left when I did, can still hear music and the words of loved ones.
NASCAR vehicle’s V-8 engines can’t reach top speeds of 200 mph or perforate a young man’s eardrum without gasoline. Like many gas-powered engines, NASCAR’s use a spark-ignited internal combustion system, which ignites gasoline and pushes out air — making the iconic race car sound that we all know and love (with the proper protection). 
If the engines were electric, NASCAR races would be quieter. This would perhaps take away from the overall experience for NASCAR fans, but maybe the tracks could pump in car noise? Because it’s not just our eardrums that gasoline-powered engines are harming.
Fossil fuels, meaning oil, gas and coal, power virtually every nonelectric car. Now, electric cars aren’t a perfect solution, as charging anything could require burning fossil fuels if done in a region that uses conventional electricity generation. But if the region’s electric grid is powered using cleaner energy sources, electric cars are a significant upgrade in terms of climate compatibility. 
The burning of fossil fuels makes up for 89% of carbon dioxide emissions, according to a 2018 study from the International Panel on Climate Change. Carbon dioxide emissions are the number one contributor to climate change and are behind the already-changing weather patterns, polar ice loss and sea level rise.
NASCAR has yet to make the switch to electric, but the Clash at the Coliseum was rumored to be the site of a groundbreaking demonstration race that would set up an all-electric racing series — according to documents leaked by NASCAR-focused website Kickin’ the Tires.
Well, whether or not those plans were postponed — or even existed — will not be answered come February. No such race is scheduled, and the future of an all-electric NASCAR is as foggy as that of a graduating senior with a journalism degree.
While there are hundreds of millions of cars in use in the United States — less than 1% of which are electric — NASCAR making the switch to electric could still make a small dent in the ever-growing cloud of carbon dioxide.
Most NASCAR vehicles run at just 5 mpg and, unlike your average driver, do not have to comply with Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards. 
In a typical NASCAR weekend, cars burn around 6,000 gallons of fuel, resulting in the release of around 120,000 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. With 36 races in the NASCAR Cup Series, reducing those carbon emissions even just by half would be significant.
Formula 1 is making the effort to go carbon-neutral by 2030 and some drivers, like F1 driver Alex Albon, believe that the future of an all-electric Formula 1 racing series is “inevitable,” according to an interview with Pocket-lint. 
The popular racing league is also in the middle of a 10-year ban on engine development in an effort to encourage teams to explore green racing technology. The popular racing series is focused on increasing electricity use and running on fully sustainable fuels.  
To NASCAR’s credit, they have an environmentally-focused program called NASCAR Green and use Sunoco Green E15 biofuel, which reduces carbon emissions by 20% through its ethanol blend.
But, perhaps, one day, NASCAR won’t directly use any fossil fuels at all. Gas-powered vehicles currently reach faster top speeds than electric vehicles, which could perhaps take away from the excitement of NASCAR. But, hey, if you’re going to the Clash, where the average speed last year was just under 30 mph, don’t expect to see speeds that any electric vehicle couldn’t reach.

The New Year came and went with little fanfare. My mother and I watched a countdown on TV, we said ‘Happy New Year’ to each other — and I went back to my room, hoping to spend a quiet rest of my night.
God, apparently, had other plans; Barely a minute after I sat back down at my desk I got this tremendous, entirely unprompted urge to listen to Black gospel music. So I sat there until 4 a.m., fussing over a Spotify playlist while somehow managing the unparalleled euphoria of listening to a belting choir. By the time I settled down to sleep, I’d vowed to myself I would listen only to this one playlist for an entire week. Reader, I kept that vow — and I am dead certain my Spotify Wrapped is set for the rest of the year.
This is hardly my first foray into the genre. This most recent iteration was spurred by Ricky Dillard and New G’s “I’ve Got the Victory,” which resurfaced as a viral TikTok audio in the summer of 2021. Before that, it was Kirk Franklin’s NPR Tiny Desk Concert, which came out in 2021 in celebration of Black History Month. And before that, in the very beginning, it was Aretha Franklin.
There is no discussion of Black gospel music, or Black music, or American music, without Aretha Franklin. Most know her through her work in other genres — which won her 18 GRAMMYs and a long list of other awards and honors — but what really made her the Greatest Singer of All Time, as Rolling Stone named her, was gospel music.
In 1972, Aretha went up to the pulpit at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church here in Los Angeles and poured her flesh and soul into a nine-minute rendition of “Amazing Grace.” At some points, the microphone threatened to buckle under the sheer force she emanated, note after note after note. Through tears, the choir goaded her on with a verse of their own. With every inflection, she toyed with the very energy of the room — making the audience cheer, making them cry, making them stand and holler, making them sit in awe of her power, of God’s power.
I myself don’t quite believe in a god; I don’t go to church, and I’ve stopped reading the Bible. But after that first week of listening, it wouldn’t take much for me to convert. It turns out all it takes is the music: the kind that uplifts me at my lowest and gets me on my feet, as Aretha did to those churchgoeers four decades ago. Her “Amazing Grace” changed my life from the moment I heard it, and since then, I have never stopped looking for more music like it. 
Enter Ricky Dillard, the Chicagoan house-turned-gospel-musician and the man responsible for “I’ve Got the Victory.” It’s hardly his most well-known song: That prize goes to “You’re The Lifter,” the live rendition of which at the Haven Of Rest Missionary Baptist Church has over 10 million views at the time of publication. 
It’s 14 minutes long, but it feels like less than three. Large as that auditorium may be, there is no space to breathe, no room to think. All of it is filled, if not by the choir, by the soloist April Hall; there is only pure bliss to be enjoyed as it envelops and overwhelms every corner their praise can reach. No sooner than you think Hall is finished, she keeps going, still belting, with the same energy she’s kept for the last four or five minutes: “Come on now, somebody lift your hands if He’s been your Lifter. Can you lift your hands and give Him praise?” The people gladly oblige. “He is the Lifter! He is the Lifter! … He restored me! He put me back together again!”
At the 10-minute mark, the music finally reaches a lull. But you must know the first rule of gospel music: there is no such thing as a lull. Dillard gives some cues to the choir, then immediately struts over to the audience, where the equally legendary Tamela Mann is sitting timidly. At first, not knowing who she was, I thought Dillard had just walked up to some random audience member and expected her to sing. She seems no different than the people around her in dress and demeanor, and Dillard doesn’t bother with an introduction. “You look good today,” he says. “You don’t look like what you been through. Would you sing to us? About how He brought you out of that place, for you to be lookin’ like that?”
And sing, she does. She gives the performance of a lifetime, still sitting, even as her voice soars to the heavens, even as everyone around her stands. Even I stood up in front of my computer. It was an involuntary movement. There was no other reaction I could possibly muster, besides a slew of expletives which I’d best not repeat here — I will say they all started with “holy,” so at least it was on brand.
Perhaps that’s the point of gospel music: to be so overwhelmed with joy, excitement and vigor by this smallest portion of the glory of God; to immerse oneself in it; to bask in it; to let go and entirely submit to it — to be free. Though I may not be Christian, that much I will gladly do. Because what better way to defeat darkness than with light, and what better way to conquer fear than with hope?

Spanning even further back than the teachings of antiquity to the rise of aspiring TikTok influencers plaguing the USC Village, the macabre quality of horror has existed within stories for eons.
From the early recounts of classic campfire ghost stories that solidified the tropes of folklore to the Golden Age of masked slashers that terrified audiences on the silver screen, horror has undergone countless transformations to adapt to the contemporary fears of the public. This preservation of the horror genre was essential to entertaining audiences and led to poems, films and the birth of a variety of other media.
It was only through advancements in technology that enabled the very first horror game, “Haunted House” (1972), to take the world by storm and alter the way people experienced horror. This newfound scare method led to the establishment of the horror genre as a staple in the gaming industry and, for the first time, allowed audiences to actively engage in horror experiences rather than simply observe them. 
This long-standing tradition has been even stronger in the modern world. Following highly-rated horror releases last year such as “The Mortuary Assistant” (2022), 2023 is set to continue this strong line of horror games with upcoming titles that are sure to scare the socks off your feet. 
“Narin: The Orange Room” by Urnique Studios 
Bearing a strong resemblance to the structure of the puzzle-platform horror game “Little Nightmares” (2017), Narin is a third-person survival-horror game that follows a seventh grader, Narin, who is tasked with finding her mysteriously missing sister. Narin explores the secrets of her school and seeks to uncover hidden clues regarding similar missing persons cases. 
However, her adventure is far from a simple and tranquil road. Along the way, the player must hide from constant threats at night and investigate during the day to solve the case.
A unique factor that fans will enjoy and what separates “Narin: The Orange Room” from a standard adventure horror game, is its utilization of the multidimensional mechanic feature, which creates two contrasting worlds in an alternate reality that Narin must traverse through in her adventure. This game element forces players to hide from invading ghosts that come out at night in the “Twilight Time,” yet also allow for a slower-paced examination of the school’s hidden secrets during daylight hours. 
A dimension similar to the interaction of Chihiro from the famous Studio Ghibli production “Spirited Away” (2001), Narin offers the player a sui generis experience that combines the hide-and-seek aspect of horror with juxtaposing casual gameplay, allowing for a balance between two methods of play styles and a fantastic story for players to methodically pull apart. Overall, those who are interested in getting their hands on Narin will have an invaluable adventure that pulls from a multitude of genres.
“Texas Chain Saw Massacre” by Gun Interactive
Based on the horror film “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre” (1974), the “Texas Chain Saw Massacre” is an asymmetrical horror game that follows the well-known monster-versus-human format — with different characters having different abilities at their disposal.
A game in the same vein as “Friday the 13th: The Game” (2017), another adaptation of a horror franchise, the “Chain Saw Massacre” is a hunter-versus-survivor game in which players pick from an ensemble of characters — including the iconic chainsaw-wielding Leatherface. Unlike its predecessors, “Chain Saw Massacre” features a never before seen three-versus-four style game, a striking change from the traditional one killer against four survivors trope. 
In this unprecedented style, the player will get to choose from either role — the serial-killing “Family” members or the unfortunate “Victims” who must escape the Family’s grasp.
To assure audiences that their game is not going to be a copy of “Friday the 13th: The Game” (2017) or “Dead by Daylight” (2016), the game developers made a conscious effort to place a heavy emphasis on stealth, teamwork and strategy in order for either team to be successful.
“The Family will need to keep their eyes and ears open and depend on all of the tools at their disposal, including teamwork, to search out and discover where the Victims are before they are able to escape the Family’s clutches,” wrote Daniel Nixon, director of communications at Gun Interactive, in a post on the game’s official website. 
“Sons Of The Forest” by Endnight Games
An anticipated sequel to “The Forest” (2018), “Sons Of The Forest” is a co-op survival-horror game that focuses on players growing their own food, building shelter, crafting tools and fending off hostile inhabitants. After being sent to find a billionaire on a remote island, the main character finds himself in a habitat occupied with cannibalism and other atrocious threats. Partnering with friends or working alone, “Sons Of The Forest” offers a complete freedom-based experience — enabling players to make their own decisions on what to do and where to go.
Though a stray from the typical route of horror and instead borrowing more elements from survival titles, “Sons Of The Forest” will give users a realistic touch and encourage the fan base to thoroughly explore the world’s terrain and landscape while securing their safety, providing sensations of excitement to discover and the constant paranoia of death. The game is set to be released on Feb. 23.
“Greyhill Incident” by Refugium Games
Playing on the intense fear of aliens in 1950s America, with reports of “flying saucers” and mind-blocking tinfoil hats that became a cultural phenomenon, the “Greyhill Incident” is a classic take on the alien invasion horror story — set in the ‘90s in a small neighborhood called Greyhill. 
As Ryan Baker, the average joe living in the invaded suburban neighborhood, the player is tasked with uncovering the alien conspiracy while navigating the neighborhood and encountering other humans. While looting, investigating and helping his neighbors, Baker must also beware of the Greys who seek to abduct the village population. 
An indie horror game taking inspiration from “The X-Files” (1993), this horror game strays from the oversaturated zombie horror games and relies on the classic portrayal of aliens as its main selling point. With aliens with slim bodies, large gray heads, pitch dark eyes and stylish black turtlenecks, “Greyhill” is a game that is sure to provide an enjoyable time of pure entertainment stirred in with a healthy dose of fright. 
Whether it’s ghosts haunting middle school students or aliens dressed as jazz performers, the new generation of 2023 horror games is cementing the current state of the genre into a powerhouse of brilliant storytelling and execution at an unprecedented level of quality. Other noteworthy upcoming titles include a remake of “Resident Evil 4,” “Silent Hill f” and “Abandoned.”

Who are you? If I were to Google you right now, what would I find? Would I find a cohesive person, or many identities that conflict and contradict across different platforms? How many social media accounts are you active on? How many versions of yourself exist in the cyberspace ether? And out of these different profiles and sites, do any of them actually reflect your true self? 
Social media is an amalgamation of private selves. Our public and private personas have drifted further and further apart, creating multiple dissonances of the self, similar to that of a celebrity. Different facades come out to play depending on the platform we choose to show ourselves on — whether it be a perfectly posed Instagram pic, a witty tweet or a BeReal six hours late, we have taught ourselves to be masters of manipulating how we come across online. After all, the internet is forever. 
Instagram is the perfect example of how ridiculously convoluted social media identity has become for Gen Z. You have your “rinsta,” your “real” Instagram, the account for interacting with your friends, family, coworkers, peers, the random people you met at Model UN conferences in high school, your exes, your neighbors and everyone else in between who are interested enough in you and your life to hit the follow button. But, for many of us, this “rinsta” is just one piece of our complex and layered Instagram identity. 
Within Instagram, you can add a select few (or many) friends to a “close friends” story, where you can use your real Instagram account to be more intimate with impermanent story posts. But that’s not all! On top of the real account and the private story, many people use a “finsta” (shorthand for “fake Instagram”) that’s usually a conglomeration of rants, photo dumps, mental illness and general chaos. Not to mention “finstas” can have their own private stories, too. 
We are most real and authentic in our most private spaces and yet, this “private space” of truth is still just an internet profile — an online nothing-space filled with people hiding behind screens and silly nicknames just to feel safe enough to be themselves.
It’s no secret that social media floods us with dopamine when we receive engagement, and many of us become controlled by the validation we feel from likes, comments and DMs — any interaction and attention. I used to have a finsta and a private story, but I stopped using them when I realized they were just distractions, unhealthy and ineffective coping mechanisms that I overused. I sought out attention and support online from my “inner circles,” airing my issues online for nobody to really care when I needed to deal with them on my own.
I think about my old VSCO account and Tumblr blog, digital artifacts of once trendy social media platforms that I have since chosen to abandon. But they’re still out there, lost within the World Wide Web — a footprint of the girl I used to be, or perhaps the girl I used to pretend to be or desperately wanted to be. Maybe, if you Google me, you can find my cringey selfies and terrible emo poetry, parts of my teenage self I’ve tried to erase and rewrite to no avail. 
When we were younger, we were told explicitly to be ourselves. Still, every implicit message told us to conform to what everyone else is like — their ideas of beauty, happiness and success. When you can craft a persona online so seamlessly and easily, nobody will ever know the difference between who you are and who you’re pretending to be. And maybe that’s the point. If we can fool everyone else, maybe we can fool ourselves. Maybe, if we pretend hard enough, we will become the shiny, happy, beautiful, fake template of a person we so desperately yearn to be.

Dear Los Angeles,
Making fun of Southern Californians because of their adverseness to the cold and rain is a classic joke. But, then again, all jokes are supposedly founded in some form of truth.
As someone from Michigan, I find it rather hilarious when I walk outside in shorts and a sweatshirt as someone passing by me is bundled up as if they are about to walk into the depths of Narnia. Sometimes, I feel the judgment in their eyes as they shiver past. And I judge them right back.
Fifty-five degrees for me means a nice tepidness accompanied by an occasional brisk breeze. Although it may not be what I had asked for before moving to L.A. from actually cold Kalamazoo, it’s manageable. I grew up with polar vortexes and waiting many-a-day in sub-freezing temperatures for the school bus. I promise, L.A., you’ll survive, even if it drops below 60. 
In fact, where I come from, people wear shorts until it hits 15 degrees. Snow pants are never worn past the age of seven (it ruins your street cred). Gloves and mittens? Haven’t seen a practical pair worn by someone my age. Hats and beanies are more for fashion than warmth. We thrive off our own body heat in the Midwest.
In fact, in Grand Rapids, a lovely city just a 45-minute drive north of where I’m from, there was a total of five minutes of recorded sunlight from Jan. 1 to Jan. 5. If that happened in SoCal (I’d even venture to say any part of California), all Hades would break loose. As of Jan. 5, the last mostly sunny day in Grand Rapids was Dec. 4. Try that for size, L.A.
In terms of the ongoing precipitation, I would have to agree with most Angelenos that it isn’t at all enjoyable — especially living on a campus that seems to have been equipped for every natural disaster, but not for a few days of rain. The way the water collects in every dip in the concrete creates an almost comical landmine-esque series of steps to avoid. Not to mention the entire USC campus is out in the open (no covers, no awnings, not even trees with the potential to protect students from the downpour), forcing students to take unsolicited showers between every class. I can’t even imagine the spike in umbrella sales for surrounding stores and online sellers that must’ve taken place over the last few weeks.
However, it’s so sweet to see my SoCal-native friends’ faces light up at the feeling of a sprinkle (pre-torrential downpour, of course). They call it ‘rain,’ and I can’t help but condescendingly snicker. Rain? RAIN? My dearest L.A., 20 minutes of drizzle does not qualify as rain in any facet, in this world or the next. Real rain is when the lake you live on back home floods over your two-foot sea wall, comes across your backyard and floods your basement. 
And then floods it again. 
Real rain is when it takes two years to fix the damage caused by said downpour. Real rain is when you and your sister have to change rooms because they were overtaken by water. Real rain is still not having your original room back, four years later (my little sister may be more to blame for this than the climate). 
I do not mean to undermine your struggles or tribulations, L.A. I understand that there are places that have been destroyed beyond repair. I understand that there are homes and businesses that have suffered greatly at the hands of the shift in weather these past few weeks. But, from my point of view, there are a few set perspective shifts that may have to take place in order for you to fully grasp the concept of real weather.
