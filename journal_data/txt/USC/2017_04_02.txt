On a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team was able to overcome some early offensive woes to take charge in the second half and earn a gritty 11-4 win over conference foe No. 4 Arizona State. With the victory, USC maintains its unblemished 25-0 overall record and improves to 3-0 in MPSF play, while Arizona State falls to 18-5 and 2-2 in conference.
The Trojan offense was stagnant to begin the game, and the Sun Devils were able to capitalize. Though freshman utility Maud Megens skipped a shot past Arizona State goalie Mia Rycraw to put USC on the board first, the visitors scored twice to take the 2-1 advantage at the end of the first quarter. The Trojans did find some footing in the second, however, as scores from senior
2-meter Avery Peterson, Megens and junior utility Hayley McKelvey — and solid defending in the cage by sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Longan — put USC ahead 4-2 by halftime. 
In the third period, senior driver Ioanna Haralabidis took a nice feed from McKelvey to score USC’s fourth-straight goal, and though the Sun Devils would answer with a goal of their own, the score was 5-3 in favor of USC heading into the fourth and final frame. In the end, USC’s depth proved to be too much for Arizona State to handle, as the home team was able to turn on the jets and finally pull away from the visitors thanks to goals by Haralabidis, senior 2-meter Brigitta Games and freshman driver Kelsey McIntosh.
Senior driver Stephania Haralabidis’ late strike would put USC into double digits with the team’s tenth goal of the day, and a big save by Longan, her eighth, would seal the victory. In all, Arizona State was outscored 6-1 in the final frame, as USC went on to secure the 11-4 win.
Seven Trojans scored on the day, led by MPSF Newcomer of the Week Megens’ two goals and three assists. In addition, reigning MPSF Player of the Week Games, Ioanna Haralabidis and McKelvey also scored twice, while McIntosh and Stephania Haralabidis added one goal apiece. Though the scoreboard may have shown a blowout win for USC, the Trojans were certainly tested throughout the game and were forced to dig deep in order to pull out the victory.
“I think we started off a little slow, and we just were not on the same page,” McKelvey said. “But after the second quarter, we really came together and decided that we needed to change this, and it just clicked from then on.”
USC now extends its series lead to 26-2 all-time against the Sun Devils, with wins in each of the programs’ last six meetings. More importantly, the nation’s top team also extended its record-winning streak to 52 matches in a row.
Next up for USC will be a match against conference rival No. 2 Stanford on Saturday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The Trojans will host the Cardinal in a nationally televised battle on the Pac-12 Network, set for 5 p.m. with major postseason implications on the line. USC and Stanford are two of three undefeated teams in the conference (UCLA being the third), and a victory over the Cardinal this weekend would give the Trojans great position heading into the final two games of the season.
USC will also honor its seven seniors in a Senior Day ceremony prior to the start of the match.

Katie Chin | Daily Trojan Looking ahead · Freshman catcher Blake Sabol and USC will look to rebound quickly after taking a tough sweep at Arizona last weekend.
The baseball team was swept over the weekend on the road by No. 13 Arizona, unable to salvage a game on Sunday in a 8-1 loss to the Wildcats. 
The Trojans (15-11, 4-5) had dropped the first two games of the weekend 9-4 and 5-1, and they came up short again in the series finale to suffer their first series sweep this season.
The Trojans started Game 1 strong, leading off the top of the first inning with a single by redshirt junior shortstop Frankie Rios and the bottom of the first inning with a strikeout by freshman starter Chris Clarke. Clarke went 4.2 innings on 98 pitches, 62 of them strikes. He had good control during his outing, giving up only one walk and striking out three. 
The Trojans had kept the game close through four innings. After giving up two early runs in the first inning (only one earned), USC got them back on a solo home run by senior designated hitter Cris Perez in the third inning, his second of the year, and a double by freshman centerfielder Matthew Acosta that scored sophomore second baseman Brandon Perez in the fourth inning. 
Clarke ran into trouble in the fifth, however, and was pulled after giving up five runs. Sophomore pitcher Solomon Bates entered in relief, going 1.1 innings. Bates gave up two runs in the seventh to end his night and he was relieved by freshman pitcher Connor Lunn, and Lunn closed out the game for USC with two scoreless innings. 
The Trojans were presented with several scoring opportunities throughout the game but were unable to capitalize, and they stranded two more runners in the ninth to seal a 9-4 loss.
Sophomore CJ Stubbs started Game 2 on Saturday in his first career weekend start. 
Like in Game 1, the Trojans were able to get the leadoff batter on, a walk for redshirt senior infielder David Edson. Nootbaar then hit a triple to drive him in and give USC a 1-0 lead. 
Despite giving up his first walk of the season, Stubbs worked his way out of the first inning by getting junior centerfielder Jared Oliva to hit into an inning-ending double play. 
Stubbs got into a little trouble in the bottom of the third inning. After issuing his third walk of the day, he gave up two runs on singles and a wild pitch. He got out of the inning with his first strikeout of the day.
Stubbs’ day ended after the fifth inning, where he gave up three more runs on a 2-run home run and an RBI single. 
Junior pitcher Brad Wegman took over in the sixth, going three hitless innings with two strikeouts. 
The remainder of the game went quietly, with no hits on either side. 
In Game 3, the struggle to score continued to plague the Trojans as they stranded runners in scoring position in multiple innings. 
Arizona tagged Crouse for a run early, capitalizing on two walks with a 2-out bloop single; however, Crouse limited the damage with a flyout to left field. He ran into trouble again in the third however, giving up another run on a walk and a single. 
Freshman pitcher Austin Manning came in to relieve Crouse in the third with two down and a runner on first. 
Manning gave up two runs on two hits to put the Wildcats ahead 4-0 in the bottom of the third. Arizona continued to cash in the free passes, scoring another run in the fifth after a walk and a run scoring single off of Manning. 
The usually spot-on defense had a small stumble on Sunday, letting a few runs score on passed balls and a fielding error. 
The Trojans offense was present in every inning, getting at least one base runner on. But their only run came off of a solo home run by in the eighth inning, his third of the year. 
Though the Trojans dropped the series finale to the Wildcats 8-1, they managed to outhit Arizona 10 to 8. There were home runs by Perez and Dempster as well as positive outings from pitchers Lunn, Wegman and Longrie. The Trojans evidently have few issues getting guys on base; however, they are struggling with bringing runners in. 
The Trojans next face Long Beach State at Long Beach on Tuesday at 6 p.m.
A previous version of this article stated that pitcher Connor Lunn was a sophomore. He is a freshman. The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
The real Dan Hubbs emerges with the pitching being wild and ineffective. His experience as a pitching coach has
been lost with the Trojans. Way too many injuries to the highly recruited starters ( Hart, & Crouse ) over their careers
at USC. The hitting figured to suffer losing some top offensive punch from last year. The most touted hitter coming in
Sabol has been a big disappointment so far.

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanZeroing in · After a strong debut campaign at USC after trasferring from Louisville in 2015, redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron has decided to test the NBA Draft process, but he can revoke his draft status until May 24.
March could not end without one more splash of madness for USC men’s basketball, as redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron declared for the NBA Draft on Friday.
The 6-foot-7, 190-pound guard averaged 7.6 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 20.8 minutes per game this season. Aaron has not signed an agent, leaving him eligible to revoke his draft status up to 10 days after the NBA Combine in May.
For weeks, USC fans have dreaded head coach Andy Enfield’s talented young roster disintegrating one-by-one as players declare for the draft, but no one expected Aaron to make the first move.
His decision to declare for the draft might come as a surprise given the arc of his season, and, more broadly, his career at-large. 
He began the year in USC’s starting rotation but failed to win back his role despite sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright’s injury. In late January, Aaron exploded off the bench for 23 points versus UCLA at the Galen Center to lead the Trojans’ to their regular season marquee victory. He earned Pac-12 Player of the Week for his performance. However, he couldn’t replicate that performance down the stretch. In three NCAA Tournament games, Aaron averaged 7.7 minutes a game, but he failed to score.
Aaron sat out the 2015-16 season after transferring from Louisville. In March 2016, he had surgery to repair an old pinky fracture suffered at Louisville. While with Rick Pitino’s Cardinals, Aaron appeared in 23 games and made two starts. He averaged 1.3 points and 0.7 rebounds per game.
At Rainier Beach High School in Seattle, Aaron led his squad to the second of two consecutive Class 3A titles. In 2013-14, he won Washington Player of the Year Honors and was ranked No. 26 nationally by 247Sports.com and No. 33 in the ESPN 100.

Another March Madness is in the books as the college basketball season wraps up Monday night with a championship matchup of perennial powerhouses: North Carolina and Gonzaga. While it is a bit disappointing that the Pac-12 isn’t represented in the final tilt, West Coast basketball will be represented with the Zags. Hopefully, Gonzaga will be able to handle North Carolina’s assault on the offensive glass and dispel the absurd notion once and for all that West Coast basketball is soft.
While a physical Gonzaga performance would be welcome on Monday, that is just a tangential objective. Either team winning this title would be a win for college basketball purists. Both the Tar Heels and Bulldogs represent the way college basketball teams should be built, with senior-laden leadership and talented upstarts coalescing and improving as the season progresses. All the teams in this year’s Final Four represent a similar model: one phenomenal strength — whether that is offensive rebounding, lockdown defense or 3-point shooting — plus a few decent NBA prospects and a veteran team that has experience playing together and palpable chemistry.
Much like the teams in last year’s spectacular championship game, the best tournament teams this season were those who followed this model, which prizes player development over finishing first in the recruiting rankings. While every few years there may be a Duke or Kentucky team that overwhelms the competition with sheer talent, the best way to stack the deck in one’s favor for annual success is the way this year’s finalists build their programs.
This bodes well for USC, which is following a similar trajectory and currently reaping the rewards of player development, continuity and consistency. The Trojans had their deepest run in the tournament in almost a decade this year. Had a couple plays gone differently, they could have advanced to the Sweet Sixteen.
The men’s basketball team certainly has some areas it needs to improve on in order to join the upper echelon of teams both in the Pac-12 and nationally, but this year’s success was a further affirmation of head coach Andy Enfield’s vision for his program. The way to win in college basketball is the way the Trojans have proceeded recently. Teams need to recruit top-100 or overlooked local and international talent, but not necessarily top-10 recruits who are surefire lottery picks the next year. They need to have a robust player development program that helps raw talent make leaps in their shooting strokes, physical strength and decision-making skills. 
The Trojans have done this the last few years with the likes of Julian Jacobs, Nikola Jovanovic, junior guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart and sophomore forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu. While Jovanovic, Jacobs and Stewart weren’t vaunted recruits, they still had aspects of their game that had massive potential. All three developed tremendously from their freshman to junior seasons across the board. While the full development wasn’t realized for Jovanovic or Jacobs, the results will be clear next year for Stewart. The difference between him as a freshman and a senior will be immense.
The same can be said for McLaughlin, who was the first top recruit Enfield and company landed. He has improved aspects of his game each year, and his impact on the game is leaps and bounds better than it was a few years ago. While there are still areas he needs to improve, like late-game free-throw shooting and decision making, having him as a point guard is a major advantage compared to a talented young freshman who lacks experience and poise.
Metu’s growth from freshman year to sophomore year was explosive, and while he may be tempted to leave this spring, he could really benefit from another year in the Trojan program. The same could be said of Boatwright, who showed more explosiveness and strength around the rim in his injury-shortened sophomore year.
The two problems with Enfield’s model are his lack of bruising, interior physical recruits and a propensity for many of his players to leave early. Neither Boatwright nor Metu is completely ready for the NBA, and neither were Jacobs and Jovanovic. Whatever the cause may be, the program needs to improve its player retention in order to make the leap even farther.
If the entire Trojan team returned next year, and the freshmen had a year to get better with the new class coming in, USC would be a top-10 program — just as they would have been last year had everyone returned. The key to becoming a UNC-type program is convincing fringe prospects to return and better develop their games. This is by no means an easy task, but neither is winning a national title, and it is absolutely essential to get there.
The second area the Trojans need to improve in is recruiting some physically imposing post players. Jordan Bell of Oregon is the perfect example of a type of player the Trojans need. While he may have entered the national discussion because of his superb tournament performance, he was a household name to Pac-12 fans long before. There is no replacement for big men who can anchor the defensive glass and consistently alter shots.
As it is now, the Trojan basketball program is in phenomenal shape, but it can improve. Hopefully, the team will continue to tweak and improve so that in a few years’ time, Trojan fans can expect to be tuning in to watch their talented, veteran-led team on the first Monday night in April.

A peach-colored house in Boyle Heights brims with activity. A spray-painted mural of former President Barack Obama’s face covers one wall, and a sticky note-filled map of the United States adorns another. 
This is the campaign headquarters of Wendy Carrillo, a 36-year-old journalist and activist hoping to become the next U.S. Representative for California’s 34th Congressional District. A special election for the position will be held on Tuesday; if elected, Carrillo would be the first formerly undocumented woman to serve in office. 
Carrillo arrived in the United States from El Salvador in 1985 to escape the civil war. The aspiring congresswoman was undocumented from the ages of five to 13 before she gained residency, and became a citizen before turning 21. Growing up in Boyle Heights, Carrillo wasn’t aware that she was undocumented, but noticed differences between her experiences and those of other kids. 
“I wanted to go to camp when I was in elementary school, but my mother would not let me and I always wondered why,” Carrillo said. “It was only until later that I realized it was because I didn’t have status.” 
Passionate about engaging with different groups in her community, Carrillo completed a master’s degree in specialized journalism from USC. During her time at USC, she won a national journalism contest to be an embedded reporter at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She has worked as a writer, political reporter, host for a public affairs radio show and online editor for Voto Latino. 
“The thing about being a journalist is that for the past 15 years of my professional career, I’ve been listening to the people of this district,” Carrillo said. “I’ve been hearing and seeking solutions and I think there’s a big difference between being a politician and being a public servant.”
To Carrillo, being a public servant means taking action to combat the problems she cares about. 
Last year, she drove from California to North Dakota and spent two months protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. In January, Carrillo spoke at the Women’s March in Washington, D.C. She was the only person running for office to do so. Recently, Carrillo has been endorsed by Standing Rock Sioux chairman David Archambault, as well as the leaders of the Women’s March.
Fiercely critical of President  Donald  Trump, Carrillo has vowed to push back against any policies that may negatively impact minority groups. She holds the belief that diversity is essential to the fabric of American society. 
“We have a president that campaigned off the backs of immigrants, women, undocumented communities, the LGBTQ community, the African American community, the Black Lives Matter community,” Carrillo said. “I think now, more than ever, we need to be really bold and unapologetic about who we are and what this country represents.”
A self-professed subscriber to the American Dream, Carrillo said she wants future generations of immigrants to have the same opportunities afforded to their predecessors. However, she recognizes that social, political and economic changes cannot be enacted without young people participating in the democratic process. 
“It is not OK to simply be a social media activist,” Carrillo said. “It’s important to — aside from liking and sharing things on Facebook, Twitter or Snapchat — to actually vote, to do the process because that’s the way things are changed.” 
Jessica Maldonado, Carrillo’s campaign field deputy and outreach coordinator, views Carrillo as a role model. 
“I identify with Wendy,” Maldonado said. “I love that she fights for women’s rights. She’s a strong woman; she’s a woman of color. And for me, I wanted to see someone who reflects the values not just of the district, but of the future of our country.”

At the Engemann Student Health Center, students, faculty and other members of the USC community can often find a cheery dog prancing down the halls. Professor Beauregard Tirebiter, also known as “Beau,” is a full-time canine staff member that works as a wellness dog at the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion. 
Beau is not the only staff member that works at OWHP. In fact, the office proudly presents a program that provides USC students the opportunity to get involved in health promotion on campus. These students are referred to as wellness advocates and wellness links. 
After selection through a thorough application process, these students go through a training course that enables them to become aware of the tactics and strategies that enhance an individual’s state of wellness. Additionally, the students train to become familiar with available campus resources that aim to improve the well-being of USC students. 
“We have the benefit of having some very grounded, well-rounded, passionate, intelligent students who are really interested in not only increasing their own state of health and well-being, but increasing the health and wellbeing of the greater USC community,” said Diane Medsker, the health promotion specialist at OWHP.
One of the primary purposes of these student volunteers is to allow OWHP to stay connected with the student body. The office hopes to achieve this goal by providing various free workshops for student groups.
Wellness Advocates are trained to host CARE Workshops, which are sessions that focus on personal and community wellness. These workshops are broken down into various concentrations, like mind, body, connection and community. 
“Health promotion is different from health care, and people don’t really understand that,” said Paula Swinford, the director of OWHP. “It’s not about a bunch of people deciding what’s wrong with the population and fixing it, but it’s about the population itself figuring [out] how to empower itself, how to advocate for itself, how to work for itself.”
Many students have benefitted from these types of services provided by OWHP. 
Last semester, Stacy Moroz, a wellness advocate, hosted “desk yoga” workshops. A sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, Moroz noted that she experiences difficulty in allocating time for herself to attend yoga lessons due to her busy schedule.
Moroz’s workshop informed students about some easy stretches one could do behind a desk. These stretches intend to target areas where stress and tension build up. She advocates for these stretches because they provide students with an additional mental break. 
Furthermore, wellness advocates and wellness links are encouraged to develop their listening skills. 
“I feel like a lot of what goes on at the Wellness Office is conversation, and I feel like people often think that that’s a waste of time, which it isn’t,” Moroz said. 
Volunteers are instructed to employ motivational interviewing when dealing with a struggling peer. This technique focuses on listening to an individual’s personal concerns and guiding them toward finding their own solution. 
“It’s a technique that a lot of different practitioners use to help a person or elicit from a person to call on their own resources and to come up with their own plan of action,” Medsker said. 
OWHP promotes other events that deal with mental health. On Thursday, USC hosted a Mental Health Awareness Rally, sponsored by Student Counseling Services and AIM for Mental Health, at Alumni Park.

The USC School of Dramatic Arts debuted its production of Facing Our Truth: Ten Minute Plays on Trayvon, Race and Privilege, tantalizing vignettes about racism, prejudice and injustice in modern-day America on Thursday. The show is comprised of six 10-minute plays, each telling a unique story with different characters. In addition, each was written by a different playwright, an artistic choice that created an eclectic, diverse set of narratives and societal perspectives. 
Facing Our Truth features a cast of 11 students, starring Omete Anassi, Ali Appelbaum, Empress Christian, Maria Eliades, Ali Lochin, Vanessa Nguyen, Samuel Pirie, Bianca Pompa, Gabrielle Rosser, Steven Vargas and Rahjul Young. The show was directed by Shirley Jo Finney, an award-winning director, actress and adjunct professor in the School of Dramatic Arts.
Not only did this production have a stellar cast and director, but it also possessed a unique, captivating set design. Throughout the duration of the show, newspaper headlines were  projected onto the walls surrounding the stage, pointing to topics centered on matters of racial injustice, including the Trayvon Martin shooting. This innovative design powerfully set the tone for the piece and immediately informed the audience of the play’s central message.
“Our intention as a company was to grab the audience and take them through this journey,” Finney said. “When you walk into the space, you should be engaged immediately and you should know what the show is.”
The production as a whole stunningly portrays stories that revolve around racial biases, destructive stereotypes, heartbreak, loss and enlightenment. They venture into avenues of society that often go ignored, provoking a plethora of questions, responses and visceral reactions among audiences. As the production progresses, the plays gain momentum in expressing the actions committed against black people in America, culminating in the heart-wrenching story of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black teenager shot by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. 
The first two vignettes “Intro Piacsso Quote” and “Night Vision” introduce some commonplace societal attitudes toward race, class and general bias in America. The opening play takes place on a subway, highlighting the often uncomfortable interactions that occur on public transportation. The second play begins after an interracial couple witnesses a man assaulting a woman on the street, examining the unfair assumptions we often make when identifying and describing criminals. 
The final four plays are increasingly tragic, dealing with the violence, pain and death associated with racial injustice. The final play, “The Ballad of George Zimmerman,” concludes the show with a powerful examination of Martin and Zimmerman, leaving the audience with a new perspective on this baffling case. Interestingly, Zimmerman’s character is portrayed to have a beautiful voice, singing a ballad at the start of the piece. 
The performance was followed by a facilitated discussion, featuring Shirley Jo Finney, the show’s director; Brent Blair, director of theatre and social change in the School of Dramatic Arts; and Shamell Bell, the arts and culture liaison for Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles. They each contributed their individual thoughts and reactions to the play, and also emphasized the significance of using art to protest injustice. 
“My heart was pounding the entire time,” Bell said. “[This play] reminded me of how I began my involvement in Black Lives Matter. I began with Trayvon Martin. I began with the thought of my son. I began with the thought of Trayvon Martin’s mom. And then we got into the streets.” 
In her concluding remarks, Bell encouraged students and members of the audience to get involved, to step outside in the name of injustice and to hone their voices and talents to make a meaningful contribution to the world.

Love can often be the best source of artistic inspiration. This message rings true in the LA Opera’s performance of Jacques Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffmann. Audiences listened to the story of the poet Hoffmann, who, through the help of his Muse (disguised as his friend Nicklausse), reminisces about the woman he loved and lost through the tales of three eccentric beauties.
First comes Olympia, a singing, dancing automaton constructed by the inventor Spalanzani, who, after performing in front of Hoffmann and Spalanzani’s dinner guests, is broken down by the revenge-seeking, rival inventor Coppélius. After the loss of Olympia, Hoffmann falls in love in Venice with Giulietta, but is robbed of both love and his own reflection by a bargain between Giulietta and Dappertutto — Hoffmann’s likeness for a shiny, big diamond. 
Soon after is the tragic tale of Antonia, who, after a brief reunion with her lover, dies from a mysterious singing ailment under the hypnotic control of Dr. Miracle. In the end, Hoffmann is left drunk and heartbroken as his true love, Stella — the one all these fantastical stories were based on — leaves with his rival Lindorf. After receiving the bad news, the Muse reveals herself to Hoffmann and reassures him that his misfortune will make great art and poetry later on.
Directed by Marta Domingo and conducted by Plácido Domingo, The Tales of Hoffmann at the LA Opera is as whimsical and fantastic as its narrative. The lighting, staging, set design and talent immerses the audience into the world of Hoffmann. It is the attention to detail that allows for such an immersive experience to the audience, reminding the spectators that underneath the fantasy, the heart of the performance is true. 
A blue-lit Venice, with the city in the distance as a gondola slowly goes by, sucks the audience into Giulietta’s romantic, mysterious world. Furthermore, the traditional Venetian masks on houseguests and the ominous snake statue in the room points toward a hidden motive, underlining the fact that Giulietta cannot be trusted and unfortunately, Hoffmann will be left heartbroken. 
Likewise, the warmth of the tavern, its tipsy patrons and the dreariness of Munich and Antonia’s sadness enhance the audience’s understanding of the moods behind Hoffmann and his experiences in love. The beautiful lyricism and stellar singing benefits from having a carefully crafted set and lighting scheme, helping to further develop the atmosphere of romance in which Hoffmann finds himself as well as indicate the facets his true lover Stella has. 
The attention to detail and emotion does not end at the set pieces or lighting — the performances too sell the story of Hoffmann, fulfilling audience’s desires while surprising them in unexpected ways. So Young Park’s portrayal of Olympia, from her exaggerated blinks to constricted movements, exceeded expectations of what Spalanzani’s automaton may be like, but it is in her vocal range — shifting from soft to loud, jumping from pitch to pitch — that helped the audience to understand the flaws in her design and ultimately, the pain that will come to Hoffmann when he realizes the truth. 
Likewise, Christian Van Horn’s performance in place of Nicolas Testé on Thursday as the four villains (Lindorf, Coppélius, Dappertutto and Dr. Miracle) satisfied not only the audience’s desires for the perfect villain — one with a great laugh and biting comebacks — but also went above and beyond with the different postures and attitudes of his villains that still managed to maintain a constant thread of disdain for Hoffmann. From mocking the poet by holding the eyes of Olympia as Coppélius to the disgust as Dappertutto at Hoffmann’s duel with Giulietta’s protector, Schlémil, Van Horn delivers a delightful and invigorating portrayal of an ultimate villain.
The Tales of Hoffmann at the LA Opera entices audiences with its whimsical production of Hoffmann’s stories while reminding visitors that in the end, the heartbreaking moments of life can spur the most creative inspiration.

My parents rarely said “I love you” to each other — or even to me, their only child. Even now, when those three seemingly holy words slip out of my mouth, they sound foreign, strange and unsure.
From a young age, I was never taught the word “love” — rather, I experienced it through actions, through words of encouragement, through my mother standing in a freezing ice rink at 7 a.m. to watch my figure skating practices, through my father delivering early-morning newspapers for extra income. 
As I grew older, I realized that this habit of expressing limited affection was especially common in more traditional Asian families. 
It was hard, as a teenager, to navigate through the pitfalls of love — familial love, romantic love, even platonic love — when I was not exposed to its usual conventions. Although I voraciously read teenage romance novels and enjoyed my fair share of romantic comedies, I lacked the expressive affirmation many received from their parents and relatives, especially during holidays and family gatherings.
Instead, I was used to acknowledging action in place of affection. My parents showcased a constant, unique form of love for our family that I failed to recognize until I moved out of the house.
Love, I later realized, was found through family loyalty, personal dedication and daily 6 p.m. dinners. Even now, I am still learning the conventions of this strange love language that my culture speaks: Words and physical touch are instead traded for actions of sacrifice or service, and I find myself missing these little actions that once contributed to my daily life. 
I recall listening to my friends end phone calls with their parents with a gentle “I love you,” which slipped out quickly enough to sound like a casual goodbye. For me, I saved my words of love to my parents for special occasions: before my solo flight to the Dominican Republic, during college move-in day and the evening after my grandma’s funeral. 
Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
My sparing use made the words more precious when directed toward my family members, who were not used to verbal affection. The exchange of those three words was sometimes awkward and unfamiliar. None of us are better or worse at love — our means of expression are simply different than those typically used in modern Western traditions.
I am a firm believer that every individual has their own interpretation of love, influenced by their social and cultural upbringing. My experiences with verbal affection were limited, and I found myself in a subconscious dichotomy of love: I was always seeking it through affirmative words, but the love I was taught to receive was through actions of service and support. 
I used the word “love” circumspectly around my parents, but within friendships and even relationships, I applied it more liberally — too liberally, in fact. I never found myself verbally expressing affection at home, so I attempted to compensate through my close friendships and, perhaps most damagingly, in romantic relationships. 
Love is love — but then again, there are different kinds of love, reserved for different people in different situations. There was never a time when I was “in the closet” as a bisexual woman. When I discovered that I was romantically in love with a girl, I did not have any hesitation in revealing my identity to others. 
But perhaps that’s where the line blurs — I told her I loved her as more than a friend, and in our year-long relationship, she developed a selfless dedication toward me, while my feelings for her were simply stronger than pure friendship.
For many, the word “love” holds significant weight and depth. It signifies an unconditional and selfless bond, known as agape by the ancient Greeks. But for me, its definition is broad — it embodies the ancient Greeks’ varieties of love, from philia (love in friendship) to eros (romantic) to storge (family loyalty) to agape (selfless, unconditional love). I saw love through stages of affection and dedication in relationships. It changes and evolves with us, I realized, and varies by circumstance.
In modern American tradition, it sounds ridiculous that I have said “I love you” to my lovers and friends more often than I directly say it to my own family. But to my parents, the people to whom I owe my entire existence, I express my deepest love and trust through direct, unreserved action.

At Dartmouth, students can get the morning-after pill from an unlikely place — a vending machine. The vending machine, which also provides cough syrup, painkillers, nasal spray and other health products, is an innovative solution to the problem that students on college campuses around the country face: They need the morning-after pill, more commonly known as Plan B, at hours during which their college’s health center or pharmacy is not open. According to the most recent research, emergency contraception, which can decrease the risk of pregnancy by up to 88 percent, is most effective the sooner an individual takes it.
At USC, the morning-after pill became available without prescription at both the USC Pharmacy and the Engemann Student Health Center in January 2002. Additionally, if the student were to visit the pharmacy instead of setting an appointment at the health center, a pharmacist will screen for any medical conditions warranting referral to the student health center or other health-care providers before providing the pill.
The health center operates from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Mondays to Thursdays, with the exception of pressing medical issues which students can be seen for until 7 p.m. On Fridays, it is open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and over the weekend, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. As for the pharmacy, the hours are similar: 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Fridays, with no hours on the weekends.
Students can also purchase the morning-after pill at the CVS pharmacy on Figueroa Street during its hours, which are Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The morning-after pill has the best chances of preventing pregnancy if taken within 24 hours. They can also be taken in the days after — ideally, a period of 72 hours — but the chances of preventing pregnancy are lowered. So in theory, the current hours of our health facilities allow for these scenarios.
Yet, the provision of emergency contraception should not be limited to the hours that these facilities are open. When it comes to Plan B, the sooner the better. And for students who are worried about pregnancy, the option of taking the morning-after pill immediately could be their best chance to prevent pregnancy. 
Like Dartmouth, USC should adopt a similar vending machine to offer quick, convenient and around-the-clock access to Plan B, and ensure that crucial healthcare is fully available to students.
However, a vending machine does not provide the necessary information and screening given before dispensing the pill. That is where the importance of comprehensive sex education, which includes these aspects of Plan B, when it must be used and how it must be used effectively, comes into play. Furthermore, if a student is seeking the morning-after pill, they are probably aware of its effects and what it does, and information can be provided alongside the medication if something akin to a vending machine were to be in place.
Chances are, the hours in which students might need Plan B may not fit within the opening hours of providing facilities. Students need to have emergency contraception available to them at all hours, not just when campus health facilities are open. For someone who needs emergency contraception, the word “emergency” is key.

In January, as a response to the inauguration of President Donald Trump, millions of people around the world joined forces to march for women’s and human rights, descending on cities from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. to London in a flurry of passion and activism.  Millennials, who overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton, made their presence known, especially on social media, where photos and captions of unity and strength flooded timelines and newsfeeds.
But when the posters began collecting dust in our closets, for some Americans, the fire that burned in our hearts began to dwindle as complacency and normalcy began to sink in — and so here we are, two months later.
Let’s dispel with the notion that millennials don’t know what we’re doing — we know exactly what we’re doing.  I’m just worried that we’re not doing enough.
Look to history — millennials spearheaded the anti-Vietnam protests and, more recently, led the charge for economic and racial equality with the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements.
But now, after only roughly half of eligible millennials voted in the 2016 election, the issue becomes what we will do until the 2018 midterm elections, when historically millennials have turned out in even fewer numbers.
As a founder of a political club on campus, I’ve seen activism on USC’s campus wax and wane, but mostly the latter.  After a brief spell of protesting and marching, we’ve reverted back to the apathy that sets us apart from schools like the University of California, Berkeley — a campus historically known for its activism. True, we all lead busy lives, but it’s a herculean task to get passersby to call Congress while on Trousdale.  And I’ve heard every excuse under the sun: “I have to run to the class I’m late to” despite their leisurely pace through the quad, “I don’t know how to” despite the informational flier in my outreached hand and even “What’s Congress?” which I desperately hope is a poorly-executed attempt at humor.
Maybe our position on the liberal West Coast far from the “swamp” of Washington, D.C. insulates us from the day-to-day pressures and crises of politics, but it’s clear that we all have a stake in the polity of our nation.  For one, USC ranked second in terms of students who would be affected by Trump’s initial travel ban, putting the rights of 252 Trojans at stake.  Then there’s the numerous undocumented students and staff whose lives depend on the whims of the White House, the thousands of students and alumni who could be hurt by Trump’s decision to roll back protections for those who default on student loans outlined in his budget plan and entire generations whose livelihoods will be impacted by Trump’s reversal of environmental protections.
But it’s hard to sustain political commitment when we can hardly show up to class on time. It’s hard to feel empowered as an individual, and especially as a student, in the midst of myriad issues that seem so far above our heads. And it’s hard not to feel disheartened or jaded when our newsfeeds are littered with laundry lists of our country’s problems while many of us struggle to do laundry at all.
Yet the alternative is a tougher pill to swallow.
I’m not asking you to change the world — I’m asking members of our generation to start caring, and more importantly, to believe in ourselves. It’s not as arduous as you think.
It can be as simple as signing up for Daily Action, a service that sends daily texts about which representative to call regarding timely issues because calling Congress is arguably the easiest, quickest and most effective way to voice your opinion outside of the election season. Or it could be donating to causes, political or not, to support initiatives that you believe in, or going out to the community to volunteer.
We delude ourselves by thinking that we as individuals can’t make a difference, but imagine the impact an entire generation can have — a generation that will soon form the largest voting bloc in the nation. So this political season, let’s pledge to avoid the sirens of complacency and disenchantment — the country may end up depending on it.
Alec Vandenberg is a freshman majoring in public policy. His column,“Civil and Civic,” runs every other Monday.
Alec has a good point about getting involved. Staying informed, contacting our US Congresspersons, demonstrating peacefully, donating to valued causes – all good ideas and sensible for USC students who have to study, yet can and should influence how our Federal, state and local governments make decisions.
Alec loses me, though, in wanting to emulate Cal Berkeley. Ugh. Riot if speakers are scheduled to present peaceful, but contrary or controversial views. Break windows. Spray paint and damage our buildings. Occupy offices and trash them. Attack peaceful demonstrators or even fellow Trojan students who express views not to our liking. Sorry, Alec, you wrote a fine article until you picked that loathesome place as your shining example.
