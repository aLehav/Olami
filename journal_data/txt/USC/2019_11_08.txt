After its successful debut in the Los Angeles coffee scene last year, the Los Angeles Coffee Festival will take over the Magic Box at the Reef L.A. again this weekend for two days of coffee tastings, exhibitions and competitions. Ten percent of profits from this festival will be donated to Project Waterfall — in partnership with charity: water, with the goal of bringing clean water to areas in need. 
Exhibitors
This year’s festival will see some new exhibitors and plenty of familiar faces across the coffee and beverage industry.
Plenty of L.A. local cafes will be serving up tastings of their coffees and teas. Bluestone Lane is a New York-based, Australian-inspired cafe that expanded to the West Coast with locations in Venice, La Brea, Studio City and more. Coffee Manufactory, a usual at Smorgasburg L.A., and Intelligentsia, which has locations in Venice and Silver Lake, will also be featured at the festival. 
Coffee isn’t the only offering — from coffee-flavored chocolates to housewares, the festival has a vast diversity of exhibitors. Baileys Irish Cream and the Los Angeles Times are just two of the many unexpected booths at the festival.
Oatly, the extremely popular oatmilk company and Califia Farms will serve up some milk alternatives for those who can’t consume dairy. Several tea vendors will also be there, including Rishi Tea & Botanicals, Spirit Tea and Shane’s Tea.
Competitions
It’s the festival’s second run but the first time that it will host the Coffee Masters competition. Sixteen baristas will be judged on their skills in cupping (tasting and understanding coffee profiles and flavors), brewing, latte art, taking orders (perfecting 10 different kinds of espresso-based drinks), creating their own signature drink, creating an espresso blend of coffees and finally, being able to identify the origins of certain beans. These are more skills than a wine sommelier needs to know!
This year’s judges include Anne Lunell from Koppi Coffee, David Donde from Truth Coffee, Michelle Johnson from Coffee Manufactory, worldwide coffee consultant Ben Kaminsky from The Chocolate Barista and Bronwen Serna, winner of the 2004 U.S. Barista Competition.
The Festival will also showcase Latte Art Live, a slightly more casual setting where baristas will show off their capabilities for creating beautiful cream designs atop cups and cups of espresso.
Art
Like last year, coffee-inspired visual art and movies are submitted to the Coffee Art Project will be featured at the festival, and winners will be announced at the end. 
The Coffee Music Project showcases a variety of musicians, several of which are Los Angeles locals. Friday has the largest lineup, with Daisy Chute, Madeleine Mayi, Amanda McCarthy and Auguste & Alden, all prior performers at Coffee Festivals in L.A., New York and London. The other Friday headliners are Erin Bowman, Levenbirds, MJ Ultra and Jnay. 
On Saturday, Karolina Rose, Nico Franc and Lisa Ritchie will take the stage, and each are likely to share songs that will be on their upcoming albums. Sunday’s headliner is a mother-daughter duo of Lua, a multidisciplinary artist and her daughter Sharon. Additionally, Michael K, a Thornton School of Music senior majoring in music industry, will be performing Sunday.
This year, the Movie Room will feature shorts that had been submitted to The Coffee Art Project, an international art competition that is themes around coffee and coffee culture. 
Two documentaries will be screened — one on the coffee leaf by Wize Monkey and one about how people choose what they eat, by Califia Farms. Stumptown Roasters created two shorts that will be shown as well.
The Coffee Art Project takes artworks across different mediums, and this year’s showing should be impressive. Some extremely creative artworks last year were constructed entirely of differently colored coffee beans or paper stained with coffee. But all media — paintings, drawings, photography, film, design, sculpture and conceptual art — are accepted so long as they relate to the idea of coffee or the “coffee shop experience.”
Tips for first-timers
Pace yourself. Drinking too much coffee in a single day can cause dizziness and many other symptoms. Be sure to drink plenty of water and watch how much caffeine you consume.
Bring a reusable bag. Vendors have a lot to give out, and you’ll walk away with plenty of flyers, samples and products. 
Schedule your day. Be sure not to miss exciting showcases or competitions by setting a schedule for yourself ahead of time. There’s so much to do, and it’s easy to get caught up in walking around The Reef and miss an event.
This year’s Coffee Festival is three days of some of the biggest names in coffee. For anyone interested in owning a cafe, becoming a barista or who just loves to drink coffee, this is the spot to be this weekend.

Every Wednesday, I get comfortable for my weekly viewing of the ninth season of “American Horror Story,” 1984. The two previous seasons, Cult and Apocalypse, drew on contemporary fears of conspiracy theorists (Illuminati, government brainwashing — you know, that sort of thing), but creator Ryan Murphy went for something different with 1984. The season was reminiscent of ‘80s slasher films — think “Halloween” sequels and “Friday the 13th” — right down to the trenchcoat-wearing, knife-wielding killer and the classic girl-next-door who lives to tell the tale trope. 
Not that there’s anything wrong with that — in fact, I think it’s one of the show’s strongest seasons. But it got me thinking about the art of remakes and just how prevalent they’ve become today. We’ve seen Disney do-overs of “Aladdin,” “The Lion King” and “Beauty and the Beast.” Upcoming films like “Charlie’s Angels” and “Bad Boys 3” are blatant revamps of iconic moments from 20th century pop culture. Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” is a love letter to 1960s Los Angeles, one that arguably draws more on aesthetics than content. 
I’d even take it a step further and argue that this phenomenon transcends the screen. 1970s-and 2000s-themed parties are so common that they’re already played out; vintage clothing is slowly surpassing streetwear; people buy vinyl despite the abundance of streaming platforms at our disposal; Twitter blows up at the prospect of “Friends” and “Lizzie McGuire” reboots. It is neo-nostalgia, and it is cutting across film, television, fashion, art and social media.
If you’ve read my other columns, you know that I’m not just going to tell you what’s happening. I’m going to ask what it means, what it says about us and what’s to come.
A somewhat depressing response is that we’ve simply run out of ideas. In a world oversaturated with media, in which every niche has been filled, originality has ceased to exist.
“There is no such thing as a new idea,” Mark Twain once said. “We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope … but they are the same old pieces of colored glass that have been in use through all the ages.”
I buy that to an extent, but it’s not that simple. All works of art necessarily draw on what came before them. But there is something particular about 2019 neo-nostalgia, something that Twain’s comment doesn’t account for.
Idea two: Patrick Metzger, the associate director of product at Idealist called it the “Nostalgia Pendulum,” the theory that pop culture is on a 30-year loop. Metzger analyzed more than 500 films and found that the average time it took for a hit to be remade was around 23 years. In his eyes, this can be explained from the consumer side of things: After 30 years, you have a real market of people who are nostalgic for their childhood. In turn, artists working in popular mediums are rewarded for making art that satisfies this demographic. And what better way to do that than by ensuring their emotional attachment is in place before a project even releases.
Metzger’s analysis is clever, but it also suggests that there’s nothing different about nostalgia today than nostalgia 30, 60, 90 years ago. He’s right that there are some unchanging elements, or perhaps just one: we feel more comfortable when we know how things end — a simple yet universally true sentiment. I think that is the root of our unwavering affinity for the remake, the re-imagined, the repurposed. 
But here’s what makes us different: Technology enables us to execute our remakes so much better. Advancements in special effects and CGI, as well as unlimited access to archives, allow these nostalgic moments to return to us with heightened quality and, thanks to social media, heightened hype, giving them more power and magnitude than ever before.
Whether this bodes well for the future of different mediums, and for society in general… well, the jury’s still out for me. I can’t say I’m mad about it, though, because the ‘80s aesthetic really does it for me. But I have a feeling it’ll be passé soon enough. 
Ten years from now, if Metzger is right, we’ll see flip phones, low-rise jeans and cargo pants hitting the big screen.

This weekend, USC Visions and Voices will present two related events on sustainability, “How to Create Your Own Environmental Justice Event” with Chantal Bilodeau in Lewis Hall on Nov. 8 and “Climate Change Theatre Action LA: At the Intersection” on Nov. 9 at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.
Bilodeau, who will lead a workshop on Friday, is the co-founder of the biennial initiative Climate Change Theatre Action. This organization seeks to engender conversations about sustainability and global climate change. Bilodeau is also the founder of The Arctic Cycle, an arts organization that uses theater as a means to approach difficult topics such as greenhouse gas emissions. 
“I think everybody can do something,” said Bilodeau. “It’s a matter of … [finding] what you feel passionate about … So I will put a lot of my energy into mobilizing other artists and making sure that the work that we do is in service of encouraging people to live a more sustainable life … No matter where you are, there’s always a leverage point. I guess it’s a matter of finding what that leverage point is.”
Bilodeau hopes it will inspire students to take conversations about climate change into their own hands. 
“I want [students] to feel empowered,” Bilodeau said. “[Students should] not feel powerless or that it’s too late … Yes, there’s not that much time left to make a big difference, but we can all do something.”
Bilodeau’s work “It Starts with Me” is featured in the 2019 CCTA, which runs September through December. Fifty playwrights were commissioned to write plays and the performances of these plays overlap with the United Nations’ International Conference on Climate Change in Madrid, Spain.
Paula Cizmar, School of Dramatic Arts associate professor of theatre practice in dramatic writing and active playwright, is one of the 50 writers featured in the CCTA lineup, and she met Bilodeau at Pomona College theater event in 2017. One year later, Cizmar began planning the Visions and Voices theater event that includes both the readings and workshop on Nov 8 and the “CCTA LA: At the Intersection” event that will take place in the Natural History Museum Hall of Mammals on Nov 9.
“I’m really interested in eco-theater because I’m trying to develop plays that always have some kind of, I use the word message,” said Cizmar. “I believe plays should have meaning and not just be about romantic relationships. It can have a relationship but you know there’s something else going on. I like to laugh, but laughs can also have complexity.”
CCTA addresses problems that hit home for many Los Angelenos, including air quality, land use, clean water procurement and oil drilling in both East and Central Los Angeles. Cizmar hopes that the event will cater to an unpredictable audience of theater aficionados, USC students and Echo Park community members into the conversation about global climate change. 
The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County was Cizmar’s natural choice for the theater-activism event because it houses reminders of the past and hosts an artillery of climate change divisions that spearheads data collection, California ocean sustainability, and conservation efforts focused on securing an equitable future for the City of Angels.
“What I wanted to do was to focus on environmental problems that are unique to Los Angeles,” Cizmar said. “Because we don’t have to worry about polar bears in L.A. … long distance, of course we do. We need to worry about every endangered species, but they aren’t on ice caps outside our door … We have specific environmental problems in Los Angeles that are unique to not only in urban environments, but to this urban environment in particular.”
Cizmar stresses that stewardship of Earth resources and retaliation against climate change is not the battle of the bourgeoisie, but rather a burden that everyone will have to bear. Emblematic of this need for different perspectives and diverse solutions to the climate crisis, Cizmar’s panel of playwrights and directors preparing for “CCTA LA: At the Intersection” consists of females from varied backgrounds, as well as student directors Elizabeth Schuetzle and Jessica Doherty.
“I’m very interested in finding ways besides fear as a way to engage people with climate change because I think a lot of the scare tactics are part of the reason why there are people that deny climate change,” said Doherty, a senior majoring in theatre and journalism. “I think that theater is a really effective mode for change and by using  plays and written words and stories …[they are] an effective way to get the message across without terrifying people to [the point] where they don’t want to listen.”
Doherty is directing a play titled “A Dog Loves Mango,” by playwright Georgina Escobar, a tale at the intersection between environmental innovation and surveillance in airports. The short play is one of many minute snapshots covering topics from residential fires to ocean waste. “A Dog Loves Mango,” Cizmar’s work “Appealing”  and Bilodeau’s piece “It Starts with Me” will draw upon the power of individuals to create change in their communities and beyond. 
“Climate change news makes me feel very despondent and very powerless,” Doherty said. “So I feel like by doing things that make it feel like you can at least try to make an effort even though individual action isn’t, you know; the more individuals that act the better off we are but also it is we need to send a message to companies and the people who are doing the most damage to the environment on a large scale.” 
Both events are free with reservations, and program organizers anticipate that the Nov. 9 “CCTA LA: At the Intersection” program will engender an informal atmosphere suitable for children and seasoned scientists alike. 
“[The artists and scientists] start with a question and then we pursue that question until we get to either another question or some kind of answer,” Bilodeau said. “The process of discovery, I feel like when you bring both things together, [and] you can create something that’s even more powerful than by working separately.”
