Like many of his characters, Judd Apatow really needs a new lease on life.
It’s exceedingly easy to hit the former USC student-turned-Hollywood-money-making-machine from the sexism angle — a criticism that became rather trendy among critics after Katherine Heigl confessed she had problems with her character a week after Apatow’s Knocked Up was released.
Apatow certainly makes no attempt to answer such criticism with Funny People, which features Leslie Mann — his loving wife in real life — in a slight variation on the manipulative, psychotically dependent woman she played in that earlier pregnancy comedy. Sadly, the first two-thirds of Funny People, before it goes completely off the rails with the introduction of Mann’s character, is some of the best work the still-young director has yet produced.
Many perceptive critics have done the feminist criticism of Apatow’s film very well. For example, Joe Queenan’s review of Knocked Up in The Guardian gave a truly vicious deconstruction of the absurdity of the male sexual fantasy in that film, a concept that extends to his two other films and to those his success has inspired.
So, it can be honestly said that Apatow should seriously consider taking a few screenwriting classes in writing believable women. But Funny People also proves the long-standing yet little-publicized hypothesis that Apatow should also get a few lessons in writing realistic men.
From a masculine perspective, Apatow’s movies are genuinely entertaining. Of course, they play to the male fantasy centered around ending up with a tall, blonde stunner, but that much-lauded and much-imitated way Apatow writes male banter is something special — reminiscent of the way most guys talk yet infinitely funnier.
But Apatow’s movies are not just guilty of giving men romantic fantasy fodder by stereotyping women, they are just as guilty of repetition, specifically in the lifestyles in which he places his male protagonists. Apatow’s films are not merely sexist; they are also shallowly segregated by class and race.
It is telling that none of Apatow’s movies take place outside of Los Angeles — the first sign of his lack of range. Even Alexander Payne left Omaha, making his best-loved film Sideways, in the process.
Look at the class status of Apatow’s characters. Even Steve Carell’s character in The 40-Year-Old Virgin — an unassuming technology salesman — lives a life of comfort and luxury. Seth Rogen’s characters in Knocked Up and Funny People are Apatow’s poorest, but they end up becoming moderately successful at the end of each film. Both Heigl and Adam Sandler’s characters in their respective films are ingratiated into the Hollywood lifestyle and successful for it.
The only major black character in Apatow’s films is Romany Malco’s stereotyped coworker in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Most of Hollywood is guilty of the sin of limiting black protagonists to films specifically marketed to black audiences, and with Apatow it is just another indicator of his inability to transcend the well-off, white male Angeleno hero.
Sadly, just as Apatow’s style of humor has been endlessly imitated, his lack of range has rubbed off on his imitators as well. The Apatow-produced Forgetting Sarah Marshall takes place mostly in Hawaii, but is almost exclusively about successful members of the entertainment industry.
Role Models and I Love You, Man, which have no connection to Apatow other than the comedy style and the presence of Paul Rudd (in both) and Jason Segel (in the latter), both take place in LA and both feature scenes centered in Venice Beach. I Love You, Man, which features Rudd as a real estate agent and Segel as an investment banker, seems especially like a celebration of the rich, young Angeleno lifestyle more obviously associated with Brody Jenner than with anything resembling a realistic male character.
Apatow really needs to try writing some minorities – both ethnic and economic — into the script before he makes his next film. Filmmakers need to move out of their comfort zone or their fans will recognize the stagnancy.
There were a lot of problems with Funny People worthy of criticism, but part of the lukewarm response it received at the box office must be attributed to the relative sameness of Apatow’s material.
Unlike the filmmaker, in one of those little artistic ironies, Apatow’s heroes always grow out of their habits to embrace marriage, sex or true friendship. That’s less true with Sandler’s cantankerous self-parody in Funny People but, generally speaking, each of the director’s short list of credits features a montage — set to a catchy indie song — of the hero moving out of his shell and embracing a new, mature life.
Someone should run with Apatow’s motif, give the director a catchy song — he used Bright Eyes to great effect in Knocked Up, it could work again — and a push in an eastward direction. Maybe he’ll end up in a montage that leads him to some artistic maturity.

University of California students are bracing for higher college costs after the UC administration proposed fee increases for the next term on Wednesday, with even more increases expected for the 2010-11 school year.
Despite an influx of money from the federal stimulus package, the California government reduced the UC budget by $100 million for 2008-09 in permanent, one-time cuts, and expects to cut next year’s budget by $637 million. The cuts prompted the UC administration, which already raised student fees at the start of this academic year, to meet in San Francisco this week to consider a proposal for further fee hikes.
The proposal that the administration provided to the Board of Regents — the governing body of the UC schools — stated that as a result of losing necessary government funding, the UC schools will be forced to cancel classes, lay off faculty members and close several student service programs unless they can generate more revenue without the government’s assistance
UC spokesman Ricardo Vázquez said increasing fees was necessary to maintain the high quality of UC’s education.
“We do realize raising fees is something we don’t like to do,” he said. “We know it’s not good for students, but it’s something we have to do because it threatens the quality of education that the university provides.”
The UC administration proposed raising fees mid-year from this fall’s $7,788 to $8,373 for California resident undergraduate students, an increase of $585. Nonresident undergraduate students will see their fees raised by $633.
“Students have been asked to do much, but if we can maintain our quality, our dedication to educational excellence, you also will continue to receive much. Your University of California degree will continue to have meaning,” Yudof said in a press release.
The Board will vote on the proposed fee increases in November.
“The state now funds each student by about half of what it did only two decades ago,” said UC President Mark G. Yudof in a press release. “Students have been forced to pick up some of the difference, because when it comes to our core funding, there are only two primary sources — taxpayer dollars from the state and fees paid by students.”
Students in semester system schools will pay the increased fees from the beginning of the 2009-2010 spring semester and students in quarter system schools will pay the fees over the winter and spring quarters.
In addition to the mid-year fee hikes, the proposal also suggests increasing fees for the 2010-11 school year to $10,302 for undergraduate California residents and $11,160 for undergraduate nonresidents, a nearly 30 percent increase in overall fees compared to 2008-09.
The total fee increases, including those for graduate students, would generate $117.3 million in revenue that would offset some of the effects of the budget cuts.
“If there is a fee increase approved, we would [set] aside an equivalent of 33 percent of revenue generated of the increase for financial aid to mitigate the impact of higher fees on lower and middle income students,” Vázquez said.
In November, the Board is also expected to consider a proposal to cut freshman enrollment by an additional 2,300 students, similar to a reduction this school year, the Los Angeles Times reported.
UC campuses are also in the process of reducing instructional budgets, laying off 1,900 employees, eliminating 3,800 positions and deferring the hiring of nearly 1,600 positions. This would reduce the shortfall caused by the budget cuts, according to a press release.
The Board of Regents meeting was accompanied by about  100 students and employees protesting the fee hikes. The protests resulted in 14 arrests by the University of California police for  trespassing and unlawful assembly on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported.
A number of faculty, staff and students are also planning a systemwide walkout on Sept. 24, the first day of the fall term at many of the UC campuses.
Although UC is turning to students to generate more revenue, private universities like USC are not directly affected by the UC fee increase proposal.
There may be several indirect effects on USC, however.
Katerina Aleksandrova, a senior at Calabasas High School, said she would prefer to attend a private university if both were to cost about the same, because of proposed California public school fee raises.
“I think if I get into all the schools I applied to, I would rather go to a private university rather than pay for a UC school,” she said.
Two UC campuses have already had to cancel some classes and class sections to deal with the budget cuts. UC Berkeley reported an 8 percent reduction in offered classes for 2008-09 compared to the previous year, which Vázquez said was not a dramatic decrease.
Austin Okeke, a sophomore at UCLA majoring in biology, said he is already noticing the effects of the budget cuts because he is having trouble registering for his concentration’s required classes for the upcoming fall quarter.
“My major has a lot of requirements and it would be difficult to miss out on taking a certain class one quarter when everyone else in my major has to take that same class,” he said.
Okeke said the proposed fee increase would complicate his future method of payment for college.
“The more that the fees are raised increases my dependence on loans. It’s more money that I have to worry about paying back,” he said. “With the way the economy is now, for example, my dad works for an engineering company; he’s not working as regularly, so it becomes more difficult on him to worry about making payments.”
Ian Drayer, a sophomore at UCLA majoring in applied mathematics, said he will not need to worry about potential fee increases.
“Being from out of state, we were expecting the same fees as a private institution which, coming in, is the same about as the new fees will be … out-of-state tuition included,” Drayer said.

The US House of Representatives passed a bill Thursday that would dramatically overhaul parts of the country’s financial aid system.
The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which passed by a vote of 253-171, would increase Pell Grants, expand the Federal Perkins Loan Program, simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and transition federal loans to a direct loan program.
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said the bill would give a huge boost to the country’s higher education program at very little cost.
“[This bill] would mean dramatic increases to help millions more students fulfill that dream of going to college without asking for one dollar from taxpayers,” Duncan said on a conference call. “It is the right thing financially, economically and educationally.”
Taxpayers would save as a result of the switch to direct lending, said Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor and the lead sponsor of the bill. Miller said taking student loans out of the hands of private lenders would save taxpayers $87 billion over 10 years.
“This legislation is transformative for students and taxpayers,” Miller said on the call.
Currently, federal student loans are given through private banks and lenders at subsidized rates as part of the Federal Family Education Loan program. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act would eliminate the FFEL program in favor of direct lending from the government as early as fall 2010.
“The [FFEL] program is on life support,” Miller said.
Opponents of the bill said although FFEL has been subject to the ups and downs of the economy, there is no reason to believe it cannot continue to function. Some also argued the cost difference would not be as large as the bill’s proponents are saying.
“If they take this over and swallow the whole public sector into the public option, [it] will have basically the same costs,” said Rep. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) before the House Thursday. “Only when you compare cost to cost, the government can’t deliver at the same price as the private sector. It never has, it never will in any category in the history of the United States.”
Opponents also questioned the viability of transitioning all of the country’s colleges and universities to the direct lender program.
Duncan, however, said about 800 universities have already made the switch from FFEL to a direct lender program, and the transition has not been a difficult one.
“There is nothing inherent in the program that suggests that it will not run smoothly,” Duncan said.
The Senate has not yet passed a bill, but Miller said he anticipates the bill will reach the president before the Senate’s winter recess.

After a grueling four-day training and practice session, the USC women’s volleyball team is looking to continue its winning streak this weekend, starting with Friday’s match against Portland, which they will host at the Galen Center at 7 p.m. and finishing on Saturday at 7 p.m. against Fresno State.
The Women of Troy have been coming out to play pretty consistently, and, as a result, haven’t lost a match since their first tournament match against Michigan State. Coach Mick Haley isn’t using that as an excuse to relax, however.
Impressive · Geena Urango’s play drew the praise of Mick Haley. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
“We’ve got conference next week so this is our last chance to fine tune,” Haley said. “I’ve worked them really hard this week, and although [the girls] don’t really like the practice, but they love the playing, and the play opportunities for all of them are wonderful.”
Haley said they are adopting a new approach to their normal lineup, switching positions of some key players (though he didn’t say who or where), getting others more playing time and giving things a fresh perspective for Friday’s game.
That is not to say that Haley is displeased with the Women of Troy’s current performance.
“The middles are coming on, all three of them,” Haley said. “So I’d like to rotate them in this weekend, and Kendall [Bateman] has been stellar at setting them the ball. Of course Alex Jupiter continues to be great, and Geena Urango got 17 kills last game, so I’m pretty happy with their play.”
In addition to switching some player positions, he’s planning on changing up the defense as well.
“We’d like to look maybe at the possibility at running a two-setter system,” he said. “We need to get some more players more play time, but we just haven’t been able to do that and feel comfortable in winning matches, so hopefully this weekend we can work that in.”
The Women of Troy do not know exactly what to expect from the Portland squad since their video footage was unusable due to poor quality.  But that hasn’t swayed the Women of Troy; they’ve simply upped their practice game in an effort to be ready for anything that comes their way.
“We’ve been working on some things, but we don’t know what we’re in for with either team we play this weekend,” Haley said. “Both have had moments where they play well, so they’ll both be good games.”
Haley did say that he thinks Fresno State will be the harder game to win, but that he is confident that USC can take whatever preparation either team comes with and turn it around for another two victories.
“I don’t know what we’re in for, so I just have to pay attention to our side of the net,” Haley said. “They’re good opponents who will play hard.
“Everyone wants to come in and beat us, and we appreciate that,” Haley added. “We’ll just take their best effort and see if we can turn it into good things for us.”

As traditional media outlets like CNN have cut back on research coverage, universities have teamed up to share research in a new way.
Through futurity.org, a new website that compiles and features stories based on research from 35 North American universities — including USC — schools can share their new research and read about what other schools are doing.
“The universities participating in Futurity are among the most credible and trusted institutions in society,” Jenny Leonard, Futurity editor and University of Rochester communications representative, wrote in an email. “And they now have a mechanism to deliver a wide range of research news directly to readers without barriers.”
The public relations departments at each of the participating universities send stories to Futurity, where the articles are posted and highlighted.
The system allows the universities to work around the cutbacks that have recently plagued research and science sections of national media.
“All of us were concerned about the quickly changing nature of science and research coverage in America,” said James Grant, associate vice president for USC Media Relations.
He added, “Groups like CNN cut out their entire science coverage area, and newspapers have also made tremendous cuts.”
USC was approached with the idea last January, along with several other universities, and was quick to jump aboard.
Critics of Futurity claim the site is functions mostly as a public relations website for universities who want to promote their own research.
Marc Cooper, director of Annenberg Digital News, said consumers will have to go more than one place to get a well-rounded understanding of events.
“They’d have to go elsewhere to find more critical news,” Cooper said. “You rely on many, many places with many different forms to put together a more clear answer.”
Though it may be mostly a promotional tool, Cooper added that Futurity does have some value.
“They’re aggregating [these stories] from the public relations department — from the universities promoting their work,” Cooper said. “But it’s good to have that information available, and having the web makes it handy and compact, which would have been impossible 20 years ago.”
USC has contributed about 10 articles to the site so far, highlighting various aspects of the university’s research.
One example focused on the economic impact of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Another piece included research that contrasted how men and women respond to pressure, and still another study examined the diversity in video game characters.
“[Futurity] is another tool in the toolkit to tell the story of the incredible research that’s going on at our campus,” Grant said.
The multiplicity of information sources online — from blogs to Twitter accounts and Facebook pages ­— has also necessitated a controlled online presence for institutions like USC, which served as yet another reason for the university to take part in the project, Grant said.
“The hope is, as the media world changes, we can provide some consistency and a reliable place for those who are interested in the latest news and discoveries from major universities,” Grant said.

The other day my friend suggested we drive to Downtown LA. In response, I handed him a list of the top five things I’d rather do than drive through LA traffic, which included watching The Oprah Winfrey Show, eating at Arby’s and watching UCLA beat USC in football. Needless to say, I think I got my point across about being a motorist in LA. Now thanks to LAPD, I get to experience that same thrill on my bicycle.
LAPD’s justification for citing bicyclists for riding through crosswalks is that they’re motorists, too. A $250 max citation leads me to believe otherwise. Regardless, we can all live with LAPD citing us for traffic offenses on bikes — it is apparently one more measure in improving safety around campus, a familiar gripe among USC detractors. What few realize, however, is that the university does not suffer from the same crime infestation it has in the past.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
According to USC’s most recent Annual Security Report, crime rates around the University Park campus have decreased from 223 offenses in 2005 and 243 in 2006 to a significantly lower 168 reported crimes in 2007. It is worth noting about 60 percent of all crimes reported are either robberies or burglaries, meaning criminals are more often than not after someone’s property and not necessarily his well-being.
Furthermore, arrests have risen from just 19 a year ago to 41 this year, contributing to the crackdown on local crime over the past few years. Give credit to DPS and its joint operations with LAPD (excluding bicycle citations) for this comforting news. Extensive DPS surveillance, neighborhood outreach programs and increased student awareness — along with trams, Campus Cruiser and safety fairs — have also combined to improve conditions.
Westwood, often lauded as safer than USC, actually has a higher crime rate. The Jeanne Clery Crime Statistics Report for UCLA revealed 281 criminal offenses in 2007 along with 76 arrests. Those figures were consistent with the university’s 2006 report of 272 crimes and 2005 report of 327 crimes. It is also worth noting that about 75 percent of reported criminal offenses from 2005 to 2007 were burglaries and robberies.
Though UCLA’s student population is about 6,000 students denser, the per capita crime rate for 2007 was virtually equal with USC’s, meaning the safer UCLA campus stereotype doesn’t seem to hold water anymore.
Unfortunately, the small wave of high-profile crime has overshadowed USC’s efforts to rid itself of the bad reputation carried by South Los Angeles.
The tragic death last year of a USC student dominated headlines in addition to the gunshot wounds suffered by a track star, highlighting the dangers still present in our neighborhood. Visitors often cite these incidents when they take trips to USC.
Yet, few can cite the laboratory accident at UCLA that killed graduate student Sheri Sangji last year. Sangji was extracting a small quantity of volatile t-butyl lithium when the compound ignited. She died from severe burns 18 days later.
The accident screamed of negligence. Two months prior, safety inspectors reported more than a dozen violations in the chemistry lab where the incident occurred. Corrective measures were to be taken by Dec. 5. By Dec. 29, the day of the accident, no action had been taken. UCLA is under scrutiny for the preventable accident, but, outside of laboratories, the incident is rarely mentioned.
Preconceived notions about USC, however, make crime higher profile whenever it’s associated with our neighborhood as opposed to Westwood. In response to concerns, USC has hired 22 Contemporary Services Corporation security personnel to watch over the campus until 4 a.m., hoping that students will feel more secure when they’re off campus. It’s certainly reassuring to see the yellow jackets when you’re walking home at 2 a.m., but at the same time, it is a little disheartening when their employment price is considered. Though DPS refuses to reveal the cost, officials have admitted that it’s a significant amount, money that certainly could have been allocated elsewhere — such as financial aid.
The fact remains, our neighborhood has improved drastically over the years. Just as USC’s old reputation as a commuter school is fading, misconceptions about USC’s community should fade along with it. But old stereotypes die hard and USC may always be portrayed as the University of South Central.

But you can still walk around Westwood Village at night, and the worse accosting you’ll get is from homeless people begging for spare change. Thus USC still beats UCLA…I like your specious phrase. No need to worry about what goes on at UCLA.
As a side note to the description of burglary and robbery, two of the elements of robbery are force or fear.  It may be that the suspect wants property, but never confuse the two crimes and believe that robbery is a simple property crime; it is not.
Downtown IS USC territory.  Not only is it close-by, wonderful and fun, it’s easy to navigate by bike or car.  Try it.
On another note, I’m not sure how the lab incident at UCLA figures into a comparison of crime stats in the neighborhoods surrounding USC and UCLA, but thank you for exposing the nasty truth that Westwood has higher crime stats (and I believe for violent crime as well) than University Park and environs.
Lastly,  I believe that South L.A. is a term that should be used with pride!  South L.A. is a huge area encompassing a rich past and a broadly diverse present.  I’m extremely proud that USC is a part of it.

We know all the statistics and accolades.
They are printed on cardinal T-shirts sold in the bookstore: seven consecutive 11-win seasons, BCS Bowls and Pac-10 Championships — not to mention the two national championships won in the middle of this decade.
Best of the best · Of all the sports on campus at USC, the water polo team has been the most impressive, columnist Kenny Legan writes. - Photo courtesy of Joel Zink
These stats seem to speak for themselves and declare USC football the best sport on campus.
Wait, Kanye, what are you doing here?
Hold on Kenny, I’m gonna let you finish. But I gotta say that men’s water polo is way better than USC football.
You know, he might be on to something. Since August 2007, USC teams have won four national championships — none in football. Last year, USC placed fourth in the Directors Cup, an honor given annually to the best athletic program in the country, and five USC sports finished higher in their respective national rankings than the football team’s fourth place finish last year.
So with that in mind, I’m here to tell you that, contrary to popular belief, USC football is not the best sport on campus. It might not even be in the top five.
Let’s start with the men’s water polo team, which has recently enjoyed unparalleled success. Last year, they won the national championship with an undefeated record, and they haven’t lost a match since the national title game the year before in December 2007. They are an astonishing 53-3 in their last three seasons — including their 5-0 start to this season. In other words they have become almost as predictable as a Cincinnati Bengals player’s final destination on a Saturday night.
If that’s not enough, two-meter J.W. Krumpholz won the Peter J. Cutino Award last year as the best men’s collegiate water polo player in the nation — as a junior. The Tim Tebow of water polo is back to defend his crown this year right here at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The football team hasn’t had a Heisman Trophy winner since 2005 and has never had a player receive the top collegiate football accolade twice.
Not to be outdone in the pool, the women’s water polo team has enjoyed almost equal success, as they’ve finished second in the nation three out of the last four years, making the men’s and women’s teams the best tandem since Hank Aaron and a baseball bat. The Women of Troy went 26-2 last year, and two-meter Kami Craig won the Cutino Award for the women. All this means that Jovan Vavic, head coach of both the men’s and women’s teams, went 55-2 last year and coached two Cutino Award winners for those of you keeping score at home.
Moving from the water to dry land, the women’s golf team is clearly the best team off campus (when was the last time you saw a golf course, never mind a golf ball, between Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street?), and it’s making a very strong case to be the best team of them all. They won the 2008 NCAA Championship, had five All-Americans on that team, and coach Andrea Gaston was named NCCA Coach of the Year. Overall, they’ve finished in the top-4 five times in the last seven years. It’s not quite the run of the football team, but the golf team’s recent success, including a second place finish in 2006 and a third place finish last year, trumps the squad led by Pete Carroll.
There are plenty more sports deserving of attention that I’ll try to mention in the space of a tweet. The women’s soccer team won the NCAA championship in 2007, as did the men’s tennis team last year. Men’s volleyball finished second last season and had three players selected to the U.S. Men’s Junior National Volleyball Team. Across the net, the women’s volleyball team also appeared in the Final Four in 2007.
Football does not stand in its own category as far as success is concerned. At a school where the best athletes in the nation congregate in almost every sport, success is measured in national championships. Four teams have won national titles, and countless others have played in the championship game since the football team’s last appearance in a title game in 2006.
Make no mistake; I’m not taking anything away from the success of the football team. Granted, it does have a different playoff system than any other sport. Any school would beg just as hard for a football team like ours as Serena Williams did for the public’s forgiveness.
But in a world where everything is instant, our attention spans get shorter and shorter. It’s no longer justifiable to rely on historical achievements or set up for future success; our thirst for victory lies in the present, as is evidenced by the firing of three NFL offensive coordinators before the season even started.
The football team might be the best team over the last seven years. Yet, so many teams on campus have risen to a higher level recently. Maybe this is the year that they change that and once again become kings of Trojan sports.
But until then, the crown lies elsewhere.

The war in Afghanistan conjures up many images in the minds of most Americans — the Taliban holding AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades, Osama bin Laden training in the mountains, American soldiers patrolling the harsh landscape and, of course, the numerous explosions.
But there seems to be one image that most Americans do not think of — one which perhaps is even more important to understand in order to win the war than the ones mentioned above: the image of poppy fields producing opium in the Afghan countryside.
Earlier this month, the United Nations released a report indicating that Afghan drug cartels are on the rise and that many insurgents are becoming “narco-cartels” similar to those operating in Colombia. The report also stated that these groups sell narcotics simply for profit.
Most of the insurgency in the country is funded by the opium trade. The multimillion-dollar illegal business is one of the largest in the world and is also responsible for much of the corruption plaguing the current Afghan government. Afghanistan supplies close to 90 percent of the world’s opium demand. A strong attempt to stop the opium trade, or at least reduce it, should therefore lead to a national drop in terrorism.
It is both ironic and hypocritical that the Taliban, along with other extremist Islamic groups, emphasize their strict following of the Koran while taking part in the opium trade — the Koran specifically bans Muslims from using or giving any form of intoxicant.
American and NATO troops began an intense campaign over the past year to specifically target the spread of opium as a means to decrease the number of terrorist attacks. The UN report mentioned above noted that these counter-drug efforts were somewhat successful as opium production went down by 10 percent and the amount of land used to make opium declined by 22 percent over the last year. It is too early to tell, however, if the counter-drug measures brought a reduction in terrorist attacks.
The report, however, also mentioned a dangerous trend occurring in the Afghan drug trade: drug stockpiling. According to the report, at least 10,000 tons of opium are secretly being stored in the nation — an amount that could supply the world’s demand for the next two years.
This stockpiling of opium is particularly dangerous because it can serve as a reserve money source for terrorists needing to purchase weapons or other materials quickly. It basically guarantees terrorists a certain amount of spending money that could potentially be used against targets in the West or in Afghanistan.
The biggest fear for American troops in Afghanistan is that this stockpiled drug money could be used to increase the brutality and frequency of terrorist attacks in the country. Already, the nation is struggling to survive and a sudden wave of powerful attacks could severely hurt the country’s effort to bring stability to its people. The drugs could also be used to purchase a nuclear weapon, but most experts say the drugs will probably be used sparingly and left more as a backup source of money.
As mentioned earlier, the actual production of opium in the country is declining slightly — a sign that American and NATO counter-drug operations are working. In order to continue this trend, it is vital that such operations continue. Furthermore, it is important to note the fact that many farmers are producing opium rather than other crops simply because of the fact that they make more money selling opium. It is not an issue of raising terrorist money or spreading addiction for the vast majority of growers, but rather it is an issue of people feeding their families and ensuring there is enough family income to cover bare necessities.
In order to combat the financial disparity of an opium-producing farmer and a non-opium producing farmer, the Afghan government along with American and NATO aid must provide programs and investment money for farmers to grow regular crops. The fact that most farmers are turning away from producing food has also led to a decline in available food in the nation, causing starvation. The government must prove to Afghan farmers that producing normal crops is the economically rational choice to make.
The United States, along with NATO, must continue to treat the spread of opium as a serious threat to the stability of Afghanistan, as it is directly connected to terrorist groups bent on causing havoc in the nation. A successful operation in ending the opium trade within the nation could have a huge impact — so large, in fact, that perhaps it could help Afghanistan become a fully-functioning and capable democracy.

Matt Barkley mania might be on hold for the weekend.
The true freshman quarterback was held out of practice all week because of a bruised shoulder that is still limiting his throwing ability. Barkley threw the ball gingerly in practice on Thursday but was limited in his flexibility and motion.
Status regained? · Redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp was supposed to be the Trojans’ starter heading into fall camp, but a cracked fibula opened it up for Matt Barkley to win the quarterback spot. With Corp perhaps in position to start Saturday, Carroll says he is ready to go. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
All signs point to Aaron Corp leading No. 3 USC (2-0) into Seattle on Saturday to face Washington (1-1) at Husky Stadium at 12:30 p.m. Corp took all of the first-team snaps at Thursday’s practice and looked comfortable in his new role.
A start against the Huskies would be a career first for Corp, who was named the starter in the spring before losing the position prior to the season opener.
But USC coach Pete Carroll has not ruled out the possibility of Barkley playing on Saturday and refused to name a starter Thursday.
“Aaron’s taken all the work with the ones so far, and he’s ready to go,” Carroll said. “We’ll just go ahead and take it to Friday and Saturday, all the way up to the game.”
Taylor Mays and Joe McKnight are also on the mend for the Trojans. Mays did not practice during the week because of a sprained knee, but the senior safety said Thursday that he would play so long as he was comfortable in pregame warm-ups on Saturday.
McKnight missed Wednesday’s practice with migraines but has also been battling the flu, sidelining him Thursday.
“The other guys who have had that came back in a couple days, so he should be back tomorrow,” Carroll said.
Before the Trojans’ mounting injuries grabbed headlines, most of the week’s focus centered on the clash between Carroll and former USC offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian, who is now Washington’s head coach. When Sarkisian accepted the head coaching position at Washington following USC’s regular season finale last year against UCLA, Carroll wished him well.
Then Carroll threw down the gauntlet.
“We’re coming after him, I want you to know that,” Carroll said immediately after singing the praises of his former coach.
Nine months later, the competitive juices are still flowing between Carroll and Sarkisian. Despite the vastly different states of the coaches’ two teams, there will be plenty of similarities between the two sides when they meet.
Sarkisian brought former USC defensive coordinator and defensive line coach Nick Holt to Washington to take the same position. Secondary coach Demetrice Martin, as well as several other coaches and administrators, made the move from Los Angeles to Seattle as well.
The familiarity between the two staffs could lead to increased attention to every tactical move.
“When you know the information that we have and they know that, you have to cover yourself because they know all the stuff that you’re trying to do,” Carroll said. “We know what they’re trying to do.”
But both sides have downplayed the rivalry angle throughout the week, instead electing to emphasize their own team’s performances.
“Our focus is the same — it’s still all about us,” said quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates, who took over Sarkisian’s position and play-calling duties.
Sarkisian was selected to rebuild a program that went 0-12 last year, becoming the first winless team in Pac-10 history. The Huskies extended their losing streak to 15 games after dropping their opener to LSU but got their first win against Idaho last week with a 42-23 win against the Vandals.
The return of junior quarterback Jake Locker has afforded Sarkisian a key weapon that former coach Tyrone Willingham had to do without for most of last season after Locker broke his thumb in the team’s fourth game. The dual-threat phenom missed the Huskies’ game against USC in the Coliseum and the Trojans cruised to a 56-0 win.
But Locker showed enough as a freshman to make a believer out of Carroll, who fawned over the Huskies signal-caller all week leading up to the game.
“I don’t think there is a better player than Jake Locker that we play,” Carroll said. “He’s a guy that really carries the program. There aren’t many guys like that.”
The Trojans might also face inclement weather during a game for the first time in nearly two years. As of Thursday, there was a 60 percent chance of rain estimated for Saturday’s game in Seattle.

The USC women’s soccer team, fresh off a sweep of its two-game home stand, heads to Oklahoma for the first time this weekend as it faces No. 24 Oklahoma State and Oklahoma. But this is a much different USC team that is making this trip than anyone expected at the start of the season.
The Women of Troy (3-3), No. 8 in the preseason national rankings, were supposed to travel to Oklahoma State (5-2), who lost only one game last year, this weekend for a battle of top-10 teams.
Season-ending · Junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval will miss the remainder of the season after tearing her ACL against Gonzaga. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
Junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval, the team’s leading point-scorer last season, was supposed to be the next big star for the Women of Troy, the 2007 national champions. Senior All-American Meagan Holmes was ready to have a full, healthy season and anchor USC’s backline.
But the Women of Troy have struggled thus far this season. Sandoval tore her ACL against Gonzaga on Friday and is out for the season, and Holmes is still nursing a knee injury. The injuries, combined with the lack of experience from a young team and the loss of key seniors from last season, have caused USC to come out of the gate much slower than anticipated and have left a void in the leadership role on the team.
“It just takes time. A lot of these kids are doing things we haven’t asked them to do,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “I think they’re coming along, slowly, but they’re coming along.”
USC showed signs of improvement last weekend as it beat two non-conference opponents to get back to .500. Khosroshahin said the second half of Sunday’s game was the best half of soccer he’s seen from the team this season. But there are still areas the team needs to improve on. He changed practice this week to emphasize one-touch ball movement and reading plays, rather than reacting to them.
“We just need to think faster, play quicker and just be more aware of what’s happening,” Khosroshahin said. “I hope we’re taking care of the ball and limiting our mental mistakes.”
Sandoval and Holmes’ injuries have taken a big toll on the team as USC tries to replace them in the backline (Sandoval played defense in place of Holmes this season). In Sunday’s game, USC had just one player who saw significant minutes last year, junior Karter Haug in the backline.
“It’s been difficult because a lot of us are fresh and new this season,” sophomore defender Chelsea Buehning said Sunday. “But Karter’s been doing an awesome job in the middle, and we’re all just taking our own responsibilities and pulling it together.”
With all the new players in the back, the Women of Troy have struggled at times to find chemistry and build an attack.
“Last year, we liked to play out of the back and knock it and dribble out of the back. But this year, we still have a target on our back, so a lot of teams have three forwards which means we’re playing one versus one a lot of the time,” sophomore defender Claire Schloemer said.
The USC backline has been getting better in distributing balls to the attacking players. But while the forwards have been getting plenty of shots, they need to be more efficient around the net.
Last weekend the Women of Troy had a combined 41 shots and only scored four goals in the two games. With away games against ranked Oklahoma State and an improved Oklahoma (4-2-1) that’s already won more games this season than all of last year, USC can’t afford to let chances go by the wayside.
“We need to take care of our opportunities and be really aggressive in the box,” junior forward Megan Ohai said. “When we have those chances we have to take them because we don’t know how many we are going to get.”
USC is finally starting to look like the team many thought they would be. But with the injuries and the inexperience on the field, Khosroshahin stresses that the team just needs time.

In a city that has perfect weather, sometimes you just want it to rain. But when it does, it is not typically in the same fashion as in the animated film Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs.
The action-packed film, based on the children’s book of the same name, tells the story of a weather phenomenon in the small town of Chewandswallow, and it does so with a sense of humor perfect for all ages.

Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs stars Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) as a young inventor who simply cannot get it right. After trying everything, he finally invents a machine that turns water into food. The invention changes the town, for better or for worse, into a landing pit for a storm of meatballs, spaghetti, burgers, ice cream — you name it.
Inevitably, the townspeople get greedy, and the machine goes haywire from request overload. Giant food items fly everywhere, creating an obscure kind of apocalypse. Flint struggles to save his people from the disaster, fighting flying olives and pointy peanut brittle along the way.
Flint’s adventure is filled with comedy — the kind that most animated features always manage to surprise older viewers with. The puns and adult inside jokes — such as Flint’s father being technologically inept — are spiced throughout the film in a way that keeps the cynical minds of grown-ups smiling the whole time.
Cloudy demonstrates aspects common in great children’s movies, and then some. Of course the animation is flawless (Flint’s hair looks so real I almost whipped out my comb), but it’s the writing that really brings this movie to life.
Writer-director team Phil Lord and Chris Miller do a fantastic job of elaborating on the classic short story, offering every one of its strange elements a backstory. You may recognize screenshots from the beloved book, such as the giant pancake that lands on a house, and it is truly marvelous the way they come to life. After an hour, you will have learned the origins of Chewandswallow’s name, as well as gained some insight into Flint’s motivation for success — a struggle for his father’s respect.
Yes, the film has some serious social undertones. From this “make daddy proud” issue to a subtle commentary on obesity, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs will bring out reactions and emotions you didn’t plan on experiencing when you decided to see a children’s movie.
Adding to the film’s appeal are the colorful cast of characters, each of which fills a stereotypical children’s movie role but in a delightfully entertaining way. Part of this uniqueness may be due to the voices themselves — the dim-witted town idol is played by Andy Samberg; the ditzy weathergirl, who is secretly a nerd, is voiced by Anna Faris; and the mean cop with a soft heart is played by none other than Mr. T. Perhaps most surprisingly, the filmmakers somehow convinced Neil Patrick Harris to play the voice of Steve, Flint’s lovable pet monkey.
The film features comedic lines  the quality of corny stand-up and a cast I would pay to watch with or without 3-D glasses and, on top of that, its story is actually very innovative. Aside from the fact that not every PG-rated picture features flying junk food, this film’s character development is strong and it’s plot progression is fairly unpredictable.
The jokes are frequent, but the action is nonstop. There is enough slapstick to entertain the child who doesn’t quite get it when Flint says he’s got “some diem to carpe,” and there is enough intrigue behind the airborne fortune cookies to keep the action appealing to an older audience.
The movie has entertainment value through the roof, no matter who you are. Walking into a theater full of 10-year-olds may be discouraging if you’re looking for an evening of high culture, but there’s nothing quite like a kid’s movie to make you smile in the middle of the school year.
Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs receives good marks on every level. It’s fun for the whole family, providing comedy, action and adventure. However, the film does present one unfortunate problem: You are guaranteed to feel hungry afterwards and, after seeing what junk food can do to a city, you may regret paying for concessions.

After opening its season with five consecutive wins, the USC men’s water polo team will look to continue its hot start in Palo Alto this weekend at the NorCal Tournament, hosted by Stanford.
The two-day, four-game tournament will be the first good look the Trojans (5-0) will have at Mountain Pacific Sports Federation competition, as all nine members of the conference will be in attendance for the 16-team event.

Although tough competition looms around every corner at the NorCal Tournament, there are a few teams that the Trojans have already encountered that they may see this weekend.
USC will open against Pomona-Pitzer, which the Trojans faced in their season opener at the Triton Invitation. In that match the Trojans pulled out the easy win 16-2. A win against the Division III No. 3 Sagehens would match the Trojans against either UC Irvine, which the Trojans have yet to face, or Long Beach State, who fell victim to the Trojans last weekend 12-3.
Saturday may be the day to relive the early successes of the Trojans’ season, but Sunday looms with all new opponents that by all accounts are very dangerous and improved from just a season ago.
UCLA, Loyola Marymount and UC San Diego loom as possible opponents in the NorCal semifinals, and there are a variety of teams that could be waiting for the Trojans when it comes time to crown a champion at the first major tournament of the season, late Sunday afternoon.
No. 2 Stanford, which the Trojans beat in the finals of the NCAA tournament last season to cap off a perfect season and a national championship, would be the popular pick to meet USC in the finals — especially with the Cardinal hosting the event. But other teams, including No. 3 California, could also land in the finals.
“This is the toughest tournament we’re going to see this year,” senior driver Anthony Artukovich said. “All the best teams are going to be there, so it’s important for us to come out hard.”
Artukovich is part of a senior Trojan contingent that has never lost at the NorCal tournament, and the team is looking to continue that trend in this important early season event.
“We have to send [the seniors] out with one last victory up north,” sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka said. “But on any given day, one team plays bad and they could be looking at a loss, so its important to take each game seriously.”
The coaching staff has had to prepare for most of the 16 teams that will be present in Palo Alto, and Kurzeka recognizes the level of play that the team will see up north.
“[Stanford] is just as strong as they were last year, they’re returning their best players and their goalie,” Kurzeka said of the Trojans’ possible finals opponent. “And [California] is going to put out a team that’s a lot stronger than last year.”

For all we know, Alison Sudol comes from a fantasy world. With her fiery red tresses, gentle voice and elegant, old-fashioned beauty, the 24-year-old force behind A Fine Frenzy is mysterious and alluring in the way of fairytale characters.
The same goes for her music.

A Fine Frenzy’s debut record garnered much critical acclaim in 2007, and for good reason. One Cell in the Sea is raw and heartbreaking, earthy yet ethereal. The album’s quietly haunting, piano-laden melodies transport you to another place: a lush and remote dream world that feels, somehow, strangely like home.
While her sophomore album, Bomb in a Birdcage, retains a great deal of this romanticism, it’s a major departure from A Fine Frenzy’s organic debut. The record is bubblier, spunkier and more laid-back, and feels approachable even for those who don’t consider themselves sensitive, emotional types. Apparently, Sudol can let loose and have a good time — and she wants her listeners to know it.
But what Sudol gains in geniality, she loses in poignancy. By parting ways with her more serious, meditative self, the singer also seems to have lost her uniquely mysterious appeal.
Sudol is a self-professed book-lover who likened her moniker after a line from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. It makes sense, then, that Bomb in a Birdcage feels like a short work of literature, lyrically cohesive and bursting with nature imagery and bird motifs.
Like a novel, Bomb in a Birdcage truly begins with its title. At once threatening and delicate, these four words perfectly capture the essence of the album.
The title comes from the album’s opening track, “What I Wouldn’t Do,” a breezy little number with handclaps and whistles that sets the capricious tone for the remaining tracklist.
“Blow Away,” the album’s first single, is vigorously bright and bubbly, recalling Regina Spektor’s “Fidelity.” As the title suggests, the song portrays Sudol as a spirit of the wind — liberated and carefree.
Sudol continues to channel this sense of buoyancy in “New Heights,” an invigorating song with a soaring melody, and “Bird of the Summer,” a nostalgic tune that conveys the fleeting nature of summer love: Now I know I should recover/ You’re a bird of the summer/ I was wrong to try and capture you.
“Electric Twist” reveals a cheeky, whimsical side to Sudol we’ve never seen before. The song features the artist’s first use of the electric guitar — and occasional delighted squeal. The song is quirky and endearing, reminiscent of Feist and The Bird and the Bee, but is almost disorienting in its unexpectedness.
“Stood Up,” a rock ballad with strong electronic flavors, is another shocker and probably Sudol’s most daring song to date. The vocals on the track are aggressive and tomboyish, conveying an unfamiliar, almost Tegan and Sara-like sound.
That the song is interesting and different is undeniable. But herein lies the conundrum: Where in the song is the passionate, vulnerable woman with whom we fell in love?
And the greater question: Where is she on the album?
Even the gentle tunes that hint to Sudol’s musical past — “Swan Song,” “Elements” and “World Without,” for example — seem to be missing One Cell in the Sea’s sense of urgent yet understated emotion.
Bomb in a Birdcage is a compelling album — fun, lively and at times enchanting. But in her attempt to be daring and different, to venture outside of her lush fantasy world, Sudol seems to have lost a sense of herself. To be daring requires a certain degree of danger and flippancy that the romantic spirit of Sudol doesn’t have.
Not that that’s a bad thing. Unlike Lady Gaga, some people don’t have to be loud to speak volumes.
