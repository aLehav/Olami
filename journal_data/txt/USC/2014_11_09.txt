What do you get when you mix free food, a replica of a Roman villa, excited students and possibly even more excited curators? Getty Villa’s College Night, of course.
This Tuesday, the Getty Villa will be hosting its annual fall College Night, offering behind-the-scenes tours, food, music and caricature artists, all free for college students. But it’s not just a classroom trip to the museum. Shelby Brown, educational specialist at the Villa, explained that though most school museum visits are conducted by professors with a certain agenda, College Night allows students to “visit in a completely student-friendly environment, free from any classroom obligations.”

“We assume that just by being in a museum people discover things they like that they might not otherwise.”
Since the Villa itself is a replica of an ancient Roman villa and all the displays are Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities, the museum can present fun things to do while maintaining a connection to the ancient world. This was precisely the Getty’s goal when the institution started College Night in 2006 at the Getty Center. Its popularity allowed it to grow to two nights each year: one in the spring at the Center, the other in the fall at the Villa.
College Night will feature special tours, some of which will focus on heroes and warriors against their human and monster opponents to honor Veterans Day, behind-the-scenes tours of the Conservation Labs and the Getty Research Institute Science Lab, and a sneak peek of an upcoming exhibition.
“These are hot-ticket items because the conservators and scientists can only offer a few tours,” Brown said. She added that there will be plenty of other exclusive tours for attendees — rather than sticking to the usual public tours, “staff and docents give tours that interest them,” meaning they will be more thought-provoking and interesting that the typical cookie-cutter tours.
In addition to these exclusive tours, there will be other events not open to the public, such as Roman reenactors from Legio VI Victrix, who portray soldiers and officers, officials of the empire, as well as ordinary Roman citizens. While previous years have offered gladiator fashion shows, a decorate-your-own Roman vase activity and special photo ops, Brown says this year, the Villa is “experimenting with an ancient Greco-Roman trivia game” that will feature tables with buzzers, an MC, and great prizes. The Villa will also have temporary tattoos of monsters from Greek mythology and a table for making your own diadems and victory wreaths out of olive tree leaves from the Villa’s garden.
Professor of classics Daniel Richter encourages all his students, both in the Classics department and outside of it, to attend.
“The Getty Villa contains one of the world’s most extraordinary collections of antiquities from the ancient Mediterranean,” Richter said. “Once a year, the Villa’s curators open their doors at night to college students; the curators themselves are in the galleries on College Night, talking to students, explaining the history of the collection, describing the meaning and importance of the objects on view.”
For students, this means a contextualized perspective on the antiquities, which provides a much more pleasant museum experience than merely staring at objects. The context also gives students the opportunity to form their own insights on the importance of the objects, to interact in a unique way with the exhibits by doing more than merely looking at them. “There is also the opportunity to go behind the scenes and witness the work that goes on in the Villa’s world-famous conservation lab.” Richter said. “Oh, and they serve food as well.”
In addition to all this — as if free food, antiquities, behind-the-scenes tours and Roman activities weren’t enough — the Villa will have live D.J. sets by Audiomoe, caricature artists on-site, discounts at the museum’s store and many more surprises. As always, students will be able to explore the museum on their own or with a GettyGuide device should they so desire, but they are encouraged to take advantage of the rare opportunities at hand. Perhaps most exciting, students are encouraged to come in togas. In fact, the Getty even has a video detailing how to properly wear an ancient Roman toga, whether with a twin/full size sheet or actual toga material.
Even if students are uninterested in Greco-Roman antiquities and free food, the Getty encourages students to come indulge in the beauty of the Villa itself and to take advantage of this rare experience with ancient objects. The Villa does everything in its power to make the night a once-in-a-lifetime (or maybe four times, if you go every year of college) experience.
Tickets are free, but reservations (which can be made online or over the phone) are required. College Night is this Tuesday, Nov. 11, from 6-9:30 p.m.

After opening a location in Downtown and a second one in Silver Lake, Vietnamese restaurant Blossom has brought its beloved beef noodle soup to Chinatown. The restaurant replaces Via Café, and the takeover is more of a renovation — the owner of the Blossom Restaurants is actually the oldest son of the owner of Via Café, so the new location was a family affair. The menu has also been revamped with new vegetarian options.
Atmosphere · The restaurant has crafted a good, simple ambiance. The indoor-outdoor design allows for different kinds of seating on the inside and creates a pleasant outside seating area during the day. – Austin Chee | Daily Trojan
The menu is a trimmed down version of those voluminous, pages-long menus that diners typically find at a Cantonese or Vietnamese noodle soup. They stick with the most popular dishes of Vietnamese food amongst non-Vietnamese. Blossom’s signature dishes are pho and spring rolls.
For the uninitiated, pho is a Vietnamese soup noodle, with a relatively light, clear broth and thin white rice noodles. Usually some sort of meat is also added, and bean sprouts, lime and Thai basil also make frequent appearances. Traditionally, diners are also given fish sauce to pair with it, but this is typically forgone in most restaurants north of Westminster, California because it has a very strong taste that non-Southeast Asians are not used to. Instead, jalapeños are frequently the pairing of choice.
The pho tai, or pho with rare beef is a well-executed Vietnamese classic. The servers bring a plate of Thai basil, bean sprouts, Jalapenos and a lime wedge. The pho broth itself is very light and mild, even for pho broth. It is flavorful, but not overwhelmingly so, and complements the noodles and meat very well. The beef itself is quality beef, thinly sliced. The beef is usually placed raw in the soup while it is still extremely hot, then brought out to the customer while it is still rare, in a process similar to how shabu shabu cooks beef in boiling water. The cut of beef they use here is also much higher quality than the stewing meat one usually sees at pho places, and it shows. The rice noodles are on the softer side, but by no means overcooked, which feels more like a stylistic decision to do so, providing a sharper contrast between the softness of the noodle and the crisp crunch of bean sprouts. It makes for a mild version of a classic Vietnamese dish, the perfect light lunch meal.
Blossom also serves an excellent Vietnamese iced coffee, which is basically coffee mixed with condensed milk and poured into a glass of ice. It has a very unique flavor, and here, they serve a concentrated dose of the coffee in a shotglass with a mini metal coffee filter over it and condensed milk on the bottom of the glass. Diners can watch the coffee brew and, once it’s done, take off the filter, stir the coffee and condensed milk together and pour it into the accompanying glass of ice.
Upon walking into the restaurant, the new open windows are immediately noticeable. Tables are placed in outdoor seating right next to the windows, and on the inside, there is a long bench as seating as well as several small tables on the interior. It’s a beautiful example of indoor-outdoor design, with daylight filling most of the interior. It makes the window seating amazing during the daytime. The floor is now exposed concrete, and it matches well with the Asian/industrial mixture of décor going on in the room.
Asian restaurant service is meant to be hands off — servers bring diners food and refill water quietly without much explanation or fanfare. This approach is intended to keep from interrupting diners’ conversations.
Only chopsticks and a standard Asian soup spoon are provided with diner’s meals, so those without good chopsticks skills might want to ask for a fork.
Located in the Chinatown Plaza in the heart of Chinatown, the newest Blossom location is just down the from Starry Kitchen. Noticeable for its bold colors and modern design aesthetic, it’s a beautiful area. Parking nearby isn’t too difficult, with free street parking easily available if you’re willing to walk a few blocks.
Portions here are fairly large, and more than enough to sate the vast majority of appetites. Meals here are cheap as well. Though a bowl of pho might cost a dollar or two more than at Pho Tai, the meal is still generally affordable. The beautiful open windows and generous amounts of daylight pouring in, and the lightness of the food they serve there make Blossom a perfect lunch spot in a quickly growing Chinatown food scene.

Garret Davis immersed himself in the watch industry as a boarding school student in Switzerland. Fascinated by the country’s historic watch-making tradition, the Santa Barbara native began searching for American-made luxury timepieces.
All of the lights · Disappointed with the lack of great American watch companies, Garret Davis founded Refined Hardware, a watch company. – Photo courtesy of Garret Davis
“It was always kind of perturbing to me that there was no great American watch company left,” Davis said. “After reading into it, [I learned that] American companies used to be the standard and basically Swiss companies were doing everything they could to replicate what American watch companies were doing.”
Inspired by his findings, Davis decided to create a watch of his own during the summer before his sophomore year at USC. He learned basic structural mechanics and ordered parts from a manufacturer in Washington. The result was a unique mix of industrial materials and traditional design.
“I wanted it to be a really tool-feeling watch, not anything like jewelry,” Davis said. “It ended up working very well because when I had these parts done by a non-watch manufacturer, the parts were really rough and unfinished, and that’s what I wanted.”
Davis wore the watch and received compliments from numerous people interested in buying the handcrafted timepiece. A few months later, he launched Refined Hardware, a luxury watch and accessories company based out of downtown Los Angeles.
“I’ve always been pretty creatively inclined, drawing, art and so forth,” Davis said. “I challenged myself to see if I could make something out of the norm and thought that a watch would be pretty cool.”
A senior majoring in social sciences (psychology), Davis now oversees a thriving e-commerce enterprise and a pop-up boutique in Beverly Hills with footwear brand the Left Shoe Company and suit tailor Elevee. He said he never imagined transforming his hobby into a business.
“I had a passion for watches. I had a passion for design, and specifically industrial design, so I guess it checked all of the boxes of what I would’ve wanted for a dream job,” Davis said. “But at the time it wasn’t really something I thought about.”
Davis and two other craftsmen assemble the custom, limited edition watches by hand. Refined Hardware works with customers to accommodate specific design requests and offers consistent clients membership to an exclusive owner’s circle.
“Our mission goes back to the nostalgic motif of what watches used to be, the real artisan aspect to timepieces,” Davis said.
The models run from about $1,500 to $3,000; each piece comes individually numbered with an owner’s manual signed by the artisan who made it. Davis acknowledged the challenges he encountered while trying to penetrate an industry dominated by iconic and established brands.
He said Refined Hardware’s unique aesthetic distinguishes it from other high-end watch companies. The unconventional materials and design attract an adventurous and fashion-forward demographic.
“I think that taking the time to understand who your buyer potentially could be and positioning your product within that aesthetic is really important,” Davis said. “People really love the raw, industrial nature of the pieces and like the story of them being built in downtown L.A.”
As Refined Hardware has grown rapidly, Davis has learned to balance academics with business. His days are tightly organized between classes, meetings and production, leaving little time for socializing and getting together with friends.
Though he has relished the process of starting a business, Davis said that popular media over-glamourizes the notion of being an entrepreneur in college.
“It’s manageable by all means ,but you just end up cutting out everything that isn’t 100 percent constructive,” Davis said.
Despite the long hours he dedicates to Refined Hardware every week, Davis said it has never felt like a chore. He advised student entrepreneurs to follow their passion rather than focus on making money right away.
Approaching watch-making as a creative pursuit allowed Davis to hone his vision without the pressure of pleasing customers.
“The money really far more follows the passion than vice versa,” Davis said. “If you are trying to create this artistic endeavor to solely make money, then your vision of it is going to be kind of skewed.”
In the coming months, Refined Hardware will launch its fifth collection of watches, introduce an innovative online ordering system for custom designs and unveil a holiday retail location in New York City.
“The entrepreneurial journey is always amazing and it’s going to have its highs, it’s going to have it’s lows, but either way you are never going to feel more alive,” Davis said.

Students that ventured into the cooling November night on Saturday were treated to a dazzling spectacle of lights, music and “cirque,” the French word for circus. It has taken on a meaning that refers to human performance art.
Raging success · Over 500 USC students witnessed the spectacle. The performance was divided into four acts, and the feedback from students in the crowd on the performances was uniformly positive. — Photo courtesy of USC Performing Arts Committee
About 500 students milled about on McCarthy Quad throughout the evening, playing carnival games, drinking hot chocolate and watching the artwork of the physical feats of Dream World Cirque’s best performers at Cirque ’SC.
A program organized by the Performing Arts Committee of Program Board, Cirque ’SC was the brainchild of Performing Arts Committee Executive Director Monisha Bajaj. She envisioned bringing a circus act to campus when she first joined the Performing Arts Committee three years ago and was thrilled to see it come to fruition Saturday night.
“I never imagined it [would] be outside, or that we would get the feedback that we did,” she said.
The show consisted of a variety of cirque acts, including ribbon dancing, stilt walking, aerial silk acrobatics and a performance on a Cyr wheel, a large metal wheel that an acrobat uses to spin around the stage. Four acts took place, with constant ambient performances in between, and viewers got a visual treat in a variety of ways.
The stage was set up with apparatuses to hang the silks from and colorfully lit from all around, giving the vividly costumed performers an ethereal glow as they contorted, spun and danced.
Bajaj described the inspiration for the event to be promotion of visual and performing arts and said that she wanted to create an experience in as many senses possible. Though Performing Arts Committee often puts on programs for what Bajaj described as niche audiences, she believes the amazing show of talent at Cirque ’SC really brought the enthusiasm of the students.
The performers themselves were excited to have a chance to showcase their art and skills. Seventeen-year-old Lauren Hasserjian was one of the aerial acrobats and got involved in cirque art through her gymnastics background. She described the show as more than just a spectacle, as a strong form of artistic expression and release.
“I think I can relate my struggles in life to gravity, so when I go up there, I’m looking down on my struggles,” Hasserjian said. “I feel invincible and liberated.”
Hasserjian is a full-time student and part-time worker, and said the stress of her busy life is released when she goes to aerial practice. She is part of Dream World Cirque, a boutique cirque company founded by performer Jena Carpenter in 2005. Carpenter herself has been professionally performing all around the world since 2000, and was in the film Polar Express and one of Outkast’s music videos.
Hasserjian said the number of gigs each type of performer gets in a month varies, and was excited that Cirque ’SC called for so many different shows of talent.
The event’s environment was augmented by the D.J. skills of freshman music industry student Tanner Williams, who has been producing and deejaying for six years. He said he came to find Cirque ’SC through a friend involved, and was excited to showcase his skills for a larger audience. Though his true passion is producing (his original music can be found on SoundCloud under the moniker ONX), he said he loves to help create an atmosphere. “For this type of event, I start off chill and read the crowd, and play what the crowd is into,” Williams said. “I started with the circus theme, and went from there.”
Students responded very positively to the event, and the crowd grew as the evening wore on. Sophomore Rachel Ben-Menachem, marketing director for the Performing Arts Committee, said that they had been promoting the event in a variety of media, including on Facebook, on campus with posters and balloons and via email to get a buzz around the event. “We did a lot of things to get the buzz going,” Ben-Menachem said. “We had a promo event a few days ago at Tommy Trojan where people could throw paint darts and now it is the background for the photobooth.”
After watching 17-year-old contortionist Brandee Mills fold herself into a hoop shape and be picked up and put around her partner’s waist, senior communications major Patricia Silva was in awe.
“They’re doing things that look humanly impossible,” Silva said. “At the same time, its such a different outlet, more intricate and interesting to watch.”

Marshall School of Business alumnus Dylan Garrett, is in the finishing stages of creating a music lighting controller called LightDance with the help of Kickstarter, a funding platform geared toward creative ideas and projects.

LightDance is a compact, 5-inch-by-5-inch device designed to create real-time visual reaction to music through an internal micro processing chip responsible for reading sound and rhythm to release a light show based on the music’s bass and treble components. The innovative company stemmed from Garrett’s interest in electronic music and technology in his high school and undergraduate years, during which he was on the robotics team and took various Viterbi engineering courses to supplement his major in business administration.
“During Welcome Week, I set up the system in my room at Birnkrant [Residence Hall,] and within 10 minutes, we had 25 people and an impromptu dance party,” Garrett said. “Here I was, putting these things together on my floor using a soldering iron with parts I ripped from other products off Ali Baba and Amazon, and it shaped my USC experience from there.”
According to Garrett, the USC Entrepreneurship program is very focused on “idea discovery,” and with the advice and assistance of several key professors, including Associate Professor of Clinical Management Communication Stacy Geck and Marshall Adjunct Professor Lori Williams, he was able to clearly shape and define a business, marketing and financial plan and process for LightDance.
“Garrett took my feasibility course based entirely on taking your own concept from beginning to end,” Williams said. “The first is the business concept itself, and then there is an aspect of customer assessment, marketing communications, supply chain distribution and, finally, financial analysis.”
According to Williams, the concept is a fascinating one and can be applied to a variety of situations and customers. It can be sold to D.J.’s and utilized at parties, and it has also now been streamlined into something the regular consumer can use. This newfound flexibility of LightDance simply adds to its potential success.
“Dylan and his dad, who is president of LightDance, came to my office last year and asked me what I thought of the product before setting my office to be aglow,” Geck said. “It was awesome. We talked about the various age groups, who he could target this to and how to brand the concept for specific markets.”
Garrett performed extensive research on the technical aspects of the product and proactively pitched the concept to potential buyers and those interested in the music lightshow concept. He noticed how expensive and complicated typical D.J. lighting systems are and was motivated to create something simple yet versatile. The set-up process for the LightDance controller is straightforward — one only has to plug in a light source, music source and speaker system. Based on the bass and treble intensity of a specific music selection, the device reacts to the beat and dims, flashing and changing the colors of the lights around the venue.
According to LightDance’s Chief Technology Officer Craig Godwin, the controller’s computing power is greater than the capacity of early home desktop computers. There are standard electrical outlets on the side of the box with circuitry that maxes out at approximately 600 watts — enough power for professional ProCan lighting and line voltage lights, whereas other products are often only capable of turning out LED low-voltage lighting.
The Kickstarter site offers various incentives for people who pledge funding to the project. Starting at $129, donors can get the LightDance device for a discount and higher donations receive packs which include anything from one LightDance controller to a controller with two rope lights or the “DJ Pack” which features two stage lights and color gels with the controller. Following the end of the Kickstarter Campaign, Light Dance LLC plans to begin shipping out the product via its Kickstarter site and eventually through bigger retailer platforms such Amazon, Guitar Center, Target and Best Buy. Until then, Garrett and his team will continue tweaking design and technical components before shipping LightDance off to product manufacturers for sale in the United States.
“You can really use any type of lighting, especially Christmas lights this time of year are very cheap, or you can even plug in a desk lamp,” Godwin said. “My kids will plug in their X-Box and a floor lamp to the [LightDance], and every time there’s an explosion, the whole room lights up.”

The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies will offer a new seminar in entrepreneurship in the spring focused on the entertainment industry. The two-unit course will expose students to multiple aspects of the field and provide them with the tools necessary to establish their own successful venture.
Adjunct Professor Michael Napoliello of the Marshall School of Business hopes to attract students from different departments and schools within USC. He has designed the course to encompass various facets of the entertainment industry, including cinema, music and sports. By recruiting a diverse group of students, Napoliello aims to encourage cross-collaboration and facilitate engaging class discussions.
“The class is not just for business school students,” Napoliello said. “By having a mix of entertainers and specialists and business people and entrepreneurs, we hope to create some exciting synergies.”
Napoliello, a producer at independent production company Radar Pictures, will teach students the fundamentals necessary to succeed within the dynamic, fast-paced climate of the entertainment industry. Students will analyze trends throughout history and learn how to respond to modern-day challenges in the digital age.
“Some of the things we’re going to discuss is how to anticipate next steps, when next steps are always so important,” Napoliello said. “We are going to try to understand the future, but we’re also going to look for the timeless values that make people in the entertainment industry successful.”
Napoliello said the seminar is pertinent to USC students because of the university’s strategic location within Los Angeles. The course will feature a field trip and guest lectures from people involved in diverse aspects of the industry, such as marketing, production and sales.
“We have access to the most important people and places in the entertainment industry, and we are going to take advantage of that,” Napoliello said.
The director of the Greif Center, Helena Yli-Renko, proposed the idea for the course in response to student demands.
“We get a lot of students from across campus who are excited to do something entrepreneurial in the entertainment field,” Yli-Renko said. “It was a coming together of student demand and a really terrific faculty resource that enabled us to offer this really unique new opportunity for students.”
Though the majority of students who pursue seminars in entrepreneurship are non-business majors, Yli-Renko said the course will attract more arts students than in semesters past.
Napoliello described the entertainment industry as one of mavericks and innovators, an ideal environment for newcomers and professionals alike to learn and develop new ideas.
“Entertainment entrepreneurship is one area where we’re all figuring it out as we go along, everyday, students included,” Napoliello said. “Ultimately, the entertainment industry is a really exciting place to learn entrepreneurship because it’s been entrepreneurial from day one, is entrepreneurial today and will continue to be entrepreneurial.”

USC hosted HackSC, a student-run 36-hour hackathon that promotes quick learning and rapid prototyping this weekend at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

With over 700 participants, including students from Stanford and the University of California Berkeley, HackSC was the biggest hackathon ever held on the USC campus. Participants had access to a variety of resources, including hardware and software tools, and were encouraged to build applications in the fields of game, iOS, Android, web and hardware.
“We wanted to create a community for people who are interested in creating apps and all these projects and who are interested in computer science,” said Ruyan Chen, a junior majoring in computer science who led the marketing efforts for the event.
She said the goal of HackSC is to build a supportive hacker community in the Southern California area.
“We feel like SoCal is going to be a region where tech is growing really fast, so we want to help it move along the right direction,” Chen said.
The weekend-long hackathon began on Friday evening with keynote speaker Pamela Fox, who creates programming curriculum at Khan Academy to teach the next generation of computer science programmers. Fox is a graduate of USC’s computer science department and has worked at Coursera and Google.
After the opening ceremony, participants were able to form teams and pitch ideas to the mentors sent by the industry sponsors of the event. The event also hosted workshops in multiple fields of leading technology, including game development and hardware.
“We started Hacker SChool, which was targeted at new hackers who want to build products in the five major domains, whether it’s iOS, Android, games, web or hardware,” said junior Brian Kim, a founder of HackSC. “The goal was for the participants to learn the full process of building an app after the five hours of training.”
Calvin LeGassick, a project lead for HackSC and a sophomore majoring in computer science and electrical engineering, said he wants to continue Hack SChool for the next year because it’s never been done before at a hackathon and that it did exactly what he and the planning team wanted it to do.
“The feedback we got from the students was that they were able to build cool stuff afterwards, and that’s what the event is about. We want to expand it next year and make sure that all the workshops we did this year are better and more interactive, as well as adding another workshop about 3D printing,” LeGassick said.
LeGassick hopes to expand the hackathon to students in other majors as well.
“Right now, hackathons are primarily for computer science students,” he said. “Something that we’re interested in opening up is for hackathons to be a place to build cool stuff, and that doesn’t necessarily mean software.”
HackSC had over 1,800 people register, but the coordinators had to cut down on the number of participants due to the limited space and budget.
“Though we are bigger than most hackathons, we are still trying to keep the small hackathon feeling in which people are supported and cared for,” Kim said.
Kim said the current computer science curriculum is too theoretical and not application-oriented enough.
“Currently, the computer science curriculum is very theoretical, and it’s very important to have the foundational basis, but if you’re supplementing that with real-life building for [actual] users, that’s extremely important. And that’s definitely something that’s under-emphasized and something we want to bring up,” Kim said.
Robert Hernandez, an assistant professor of professional practice at the Annenberg School, was one of the faculty advisors for HackSC.
“I helped mentor two teams that [were] composed of Annenberg students and who never have done hackathons before,” Hernandez said. “It’s really important for us to be involved in this movement and to also host it as much as we can.”
Hernandez said the hackathon fostered teamwork, collaboration and problem solving, which are skills necessary to succeed in today’s society.
“It’s working under a deadline, it’s problem solving, it’s learning digital skills and applying them, and also coming up with solutions that they didn’t think was possible,” he said. “These are important skills that you don’t necessarily get out of the classroom. This is a different type of environment that should be part of our toolbox and curriculum.”
Samir Ghosh, a freshman majoring in cognitive science, was a first-time participant at the hackathon.
“My project is called Beatbot, and it’s a dynamic drum machine that follows you as you play the guitar,” Ghosh said. “So as you speed up or slow down it keeps tempo with you.”
He and his team used a Myo, which is a motion control and gesture control armband bracelet that utilizes arm muscle activity to control digital devices over Bluetooth, and an Arduino to show a light display of the beat.
“I think events like HackSC will inspire a culture of innovation at USC. We have a ton of brilliant minds, and it’s really cool to see what happens when you put creative people together,” Ghosh said.

The USC football team’s bye week came at the perfect time in the calendar, as Saturday marked the second year of the Andy Enfield era, kicking off with an exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles. With all the buzz and hype surrounding the football team, it’s sometimes easy to forget that the Trojans have another national brand just across Figueroa at the Galen Center. This season especially, it seems like the Trojan basketball team is flying under the radar.
The lack of fanfare surrounding the team is probably explainable by the Trojans’ record in conference play the last few seasons, combining to win just 12 conference games in the past three years. The fickle nature of L.A. sports fans is fairly evident in this regard. The lack of attention could be a good thing; going unnoticed could help the young team for many reasons. Much like the Pac-12 conference as a whole, the Trojan basketball team is on an upward trajectory.
Without the national attention of a Kentucky or a Duke, USC’s players can use the early season and a soft non-conference schedule to feel each other out and start to develop some team chemistry. No one is expecting this year’s Trojans to be national title contenders right out of the gate, but they should be significantly better than last year’s team. If the team can battle competitively in all of their Pac-12 games and demonstrate they are on the right track under Enfield, this season will be a roaring success.
Enfield took over a program last year that was devoid of talent. Over the last few years of his tenure, former coach Kevin O’Neill had been so focused on the present that he turned USC into Transfer University. The majority of the guys he brought in only had a few years left of eligibility, and the few freshmen he did bring in generally transferred pretty quickly. As it is, this year’s Trojan squad only has three juniors and zero seniors.
Understanding this, it’s pretty hard to judge Coach Enfield on last season’s showing, as he was handed a roster that would have fared a lot better competing in the Sun Belt Conference or Horizon League. Though he did mitigate the roster deficiencies somewhat by bringing in sophomore guard Julian Jacobs and sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic in his inaugural recruiting class, Enfield didn’t have the weapons to run his fast-paced offense effectively last season.
This season is a completely different story. The Trojans brought in four talented freshmen prospects for the first time since 2010. Jacobs looks to have worked on his jump shot throughout the offseason. Already one of the most athletic guards in the conference, Jacobs will be one of the most dynamic and complete offensive players in the Pac-12 South if he is a threat to score from deep this season. Jovanovic is coming off a freshman year where he flashed glimpses of double-double potential. The lanky Serbian native appears to have added substantial strength in the offseason and will be a formidable presence on the block this year. His progression is eerily similar to that of former Trojan and current NBAer Nikola Vucevic thus far, and one can only hope his development continues to mirror Vucevic’s time as a Trojan.
The Trojans will also be buoyed by the eligibility of two sophomore transfers, guard Katin Reinhardt and forward Darion Clark. Reinhardt, who played at Mater Dei, averaged double digits as a freshman at UNLV, while also displaying great court vision as he finished second on the team in assists. Clark, who was originally a USC commit, brings much-needed offensive prowess and unlimited range to the Trojans.
Finally, Enfield’s first full recruiting class is led by Jordan McLaughlin, a highly touted local prospect who could soon be the court general that commands the high-octane offense that USC will run this season. Additionally, Malik Martin, Malik Marquetti and Elijah Stewart all provide immediate upgrades over the rotation players who filled their roles last season.
The USC basketball team isn’t going to go from Pac-12 basement dweller to national powerhouse overnight. The team this year is laying the foundation for the Enfield era, where his “Dunk City” mentality will hopefully fill the Galen Center and bring much needed excitement back to the Trojans basketball program. Already, USC has secured the commitments of two recruits on the ESPN 100 list for next season.
USC is a program on the rise and while nobody is really paying attention to the Trojans now, they could be a team to watch come this time next year. If USC can win eight or more games out of conference and go around .500 in conference play, the Trojans will be the team no one wants to play when February and March approach. One thing is for certain, though: From the first game against Portland State this Saturday night, this year’s USC team will be very entertaining to watch.

On the surface, ending the regular season with a 2-0 loss to crosstown rival UCLA would seem like a disappointment for the USC women’s soccer team. The Bruins (18-0-2, 10-0-1 Pac-12) outshot the Women of Troy (12-6-2, 6-5-0) 24-3 over the course of Friday night’s contest, including an 11-0 advantage in shots on goal, and came away with the victory to remain the No. 1 overall team in the country and secure the Pac-12 regular season title.
Not quite enough · Senior goalie Caroline Stanley kept No. 1 UCLA off the board for nearly 80 minutes on Friday night, but USC eventually fell, 2-0. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Despite this, head coach Keidane McAlpine and his USC squad were more satisified than somber after the loss.
“I say job well done,” McAlpine said. “I thought our energy was absolutely fantastic. We were playing the defending national champions, who have nine seniors that have been playing together for a long time. They have a lot of experiences together, and we are just now starting to figure out how we want to play and are getting some of those experiences ourselves.”
The regular-season finale was played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and smashed the NCAA regular-season record for attendance in a single game: 10,128 fans came to see the “Battle for Los Angeles,” breaking the previous regular-season record — once again set at the Coliseum in a game between USC and UCLA — of 8,527 from 2010.
“These girls may never play in something like this again,” McAlpine said. “We wouldn’t have been able to run that hard and that fast for that long without the energy of the crowd.”
Senior forward Jessica Musmanno agreed with her coach’s sentiments.
“You could just feel the energy of the crowd,” Musmanno said. “Even though we didn’t get the result we wanted, it was still a really fun game.”
The record number of fans did not faze the Women of Troy, who turned in an excellent, hard-fought performance despite the discrepancy in shots. UCLA forward Kylie McCarthy scored both goals for the Bruins, first in the 79th minute and then again in the 87th minute to seal the game. The score could have been far more lopsided, however, had it not been for some stout defense from USC’s back line, anchored by senior captain and goalie Caroline Stanley.
Stanley made eight saves in the game, helping preserve the 0-0 tie for the first 78 minutes of the game despite numerous scoring chances for the Bruins.
“I thought by far this was [Caroline Stanley’s] best game of the year,” McAlpine said. “I thought as a team, our commitment to blocking shots and defending by sticking our bodies out there was absolutely fantastic, especially in our back five.”
Musmanno was appreciative of her classmate’s efforts.
“Caroline [Stanley] made some major saves,” Musmanno said. “Our whole back line killed it today. It is unfortunate that we let two goals in, but on the whole, everyone did great.”
It is certainly encouraging for the team that Stanley played so well in the biggest game of the season thus far. The Women of Troy will need her at her best during postseason play, when the “win or go home” environment will bring about an even more intense burden of pressure.
Though they allowed 24 shots, the Women of Troy were happy with their defensive performance, especially considering the discrepancy in experience between the senior-heavy Bruin team and the youth-infused USC squad.
“I have all sophomores on my defensive line,” Stanley said. “That’s almost unheard of: the entire UCLA starting line is seniors. Despite being young, our team played like women tonight. They made my job a lot easier that it could have been, should have been and has been in the past, so I am just very proud of them.”
Despite the largely positive outlook on Friday’s game, the Women of Troy know they still have things to work on to find success in the postseason, particularly offensively.
“We could have been better in our front half,” McAlpine said. “We weren’t as patient when we got in their half of the field. We tried to force things down the middle of the field and they did a good job of collapsing the space in the middle. We needed to get the ball out wide a little more and try to get around the edge.”
In addition to the weight of the rivalry, Friday’s game was also emotional for the four seniors on the team, as they were honored for their leadership and participation during their time as USC players. Fortunately, and unlike in years past, Friday’s game was more sweet than bitter for the seniors.
“It was an emotional night obviously,” Stanley said. “However, in the past, this has been the last game of the season for USC. There hasn’t been hope for a postseason berth in quite a while, so it made it a little sweeter knowing that this isn’t our final game.”
Though the Women of Troy do not yet know their postseason fate, they are expected to be selected for the playoffs after finishing the regular season with both a winning conference record and winning record overall. The team plans on using Friday’s game as a learning tool to improve before beginning their postseason quest.
“I think the loss to UCLA will help us be even more competitive in practice this week,” Musmanno said. “We now know the level of competition we will see in the postseason. There is no team better than UCLA, the defending champions, and I think we stuck with them well for the most part. I think we can go pretty far in the playoffs, and I would love to see us play them again.”
Despite not knowing their playoff destiny, the team has no shortage of confidence in their ability to make noise in the postseason, no matter who their opponent may be.
“We’ve got a really good team,” McAlpine said. “I’m very excited about our future and how we played against UCLA. Yes, we can fine-tune some things, and yes, we probably got caught up in the moment a few times, but the truth is, we are only now cracking the surface of what our potential can be.”
The team will find out where they stand on Monday during the NCAA Division I Women’s Soccer Tournament selection show at 1:30 p.m. on NCAA.com. The Women of Troy are expected to earn a berth, but will likely be playing on the road for the duration of the playoffs.

After a rough first season, USC men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield feels optimistic about the future of his team. USC was able to land some exciting prospects that could help the team compete immediately in the difficult Pac-12 conference. Daily Trojan staff writer Nick Barbarino recently had the chance to sit down with the second-year coach to get his thoughts on the upcoming season.
Dunk City LA · Head coach Andy Enfield led USC to an overall record of 11-21 in his first season, with just two wins in Pac-12 play. Enfield guided Florida Gulf Coast to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament in 2013. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
DT: Last season, Byron Wesley led the team in scoring with points per game. After losing him, who do you expect to step up this season?
AE: We have a very talented freshman class, along with some sophomores that have experience. We have two new sophomores that were transfers that sat out (last season). So the bulk of our team is freshmen and sophomores. The advantage we have is that it’s a balanced group, meaning that we’re not relying on one player to score 20-something points a night for us. We have a lot of players capable of scoring in double figures, and we need everyone to step up in a different night. I think we have enough depth and enough potential scorers [that] it’ll be harder for opposing teams to design defenses just to stop one player.
DT: Speaking of the incoming freshman class, this was the first time since 2010 that USC had brought in a top 100 recruit. Can you talk about that?
AE: Well we have four guys who are top 100 players. Jordan McLaughlin, the point guard, was ranked No. 36 in the country. Shooting guard Elijah Stewart was ranked as high as 40th in one scouting service. Forward Malik Marquetti was in the 60s in one scouting service. And forward Malik Martin was in the top-100 in one scouting service. So we really have four guys that were in the top 100 in different scouting services. So to answer your last question, the advantage is bringing in talented players. Disadvantages, we’re going to rely upon our sophomores, the two transfers and the two players, Nikola [Jovanovich] and Julian Jacobs that played a lot last year, as well as Kahlil Dukes. And we have our juniors that provide leadership and depth at certain positions.
DT: Speaking of the young team, how are you planning on keeping them focused throughout a long season that has many obstacles?
AE: Well this is college basketball, they are here for a reason and that’s to be student athletes and have the opportunity of a lifetime. So if they’re not focused or ready to play, well then they need to be.
DT: You were really famous for Dunk City two seasons ago in the NCAA Tournament. Are we going to see that type of play this year or is that in the past?
AE: Dunk City was a name that someone else gave our team at Florida Gulf Coast. I was fortunate to coach a terrific group of young players that developed quickly and were able to execute a system in a very effective way on both ends of the floor. They were an excellent defensive and offensive team. There are particular parts of that system that I believe in and it starts on the defensive end and there are things that we want to do on the offensive end here at USC. Give our assistant coaches a ton of credit because those two transfers and the four freshmen that we’ve recruited and brought in as a staff are excellent players and they are able to fit what we’re trying to do on both ends of the floor. We also plan on bringing players in from the 2015 class that are able to do what we would like to do on the offense and defensive end.
DT: With such a young team, what are you expecting to see this season? A lot of growth among the players or is this team ready to compete with the Arizona’s and UCLA’s of the Pac-12 conference?
AE: We’re expecting to compete every game and every night out on the floor. I don’t set goals as far as wins and losses as a coach. And our coaching staff, our goal is to develop our players and make them better every week. As we go through the season, our young players need to mature and develop quickly because we don’t have any seniors. Our goal is to compete, get better and, if we do the things that we’re capable of doing on the offensive and defensive end, we should have a successful season.
DT: You were able to bring in Jordan McLaughlin over many rival schools. What do you attribute that to?
AE: We recruit for USC and what we’re trying to do. We recruited Jordan [McLaughlin] because we loved him as a player and he’s also a great kid. He comes from a wonderful family, and we think he has potential to be a big-time leader and just a terrific player at USC for the near future. We’re extremely excited about having Jordan [McLaughlin], and at the same time, we understand that he’s a freshman and it’s a great opportunity for him to come to a young team and develop quickly.
USC kicks off their preseason schedule next Saturday, Nov. 15, against the Portland State Vikings. The game will be at the Galen Center with a tip-off time of 7:30 PST.

Shake it off? More like shake it up. On Nov. 3, Taylor Swift pulled her first four albums — Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now and Red — from the Spotify catalog, sparking heated discussion among fans and critics. Swift, who is in the midst of promoting her already record-breaking album, 1989, has always been vocal about her opposition to digitally streamed music. In her Wall Street Journal op-ed published July 7, Swift criticized music streaming services. “Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for,” she wrote. Though Swift’s argument against streaming services presents valid points, she has a faulty understanding of the payment process and the current music climate.

I truly believe musicians should be financially compensated for their work. I can only imagine the countless hours of dedication most musical artists spend in the studio producing their songs; thus, there must be a financial transaction between consumers and those putting out the product. It’s basic economics. Yet, it seems like Swift asks for a little too much. According to Billboard, she earned almost $40 million just last year. Swift’s profits have stemmed from her musical ventures — CDs, tours, etc. — and promotional events such as her CoverGirl sponsorship. Therefore, she is rewarded for her work, and it is a hefty reward at that. Spotify is one other avenue from which Swift generates money, and though it might not be the most lucrative form of profit at $0.006 to $0.00084 per stream, it is still money that is collected and deposited into her bank account. Though Swift uses her op-ed to criticize third-party music distributors for allowing users to listen to and download music for free, she does indeed receive payment for her “valuable thing.”
Swift, in her op-ed, then goes on to state, “It’s my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album’s price point is.” As a profitable artist, having that amount of control over the product is unrealistic. Swift fans come from different backgrounds, but one thing that unites them is the era they live in, this technological age. They listen to her songs via streaming because this is the nature of the Internet — it makes everything more readily available. Swift is denying the trends of the web and fighting a losing battle. Like radios in the 1940s, music streaming is a novelty on the rise that will be here for a long time. On Nov. 6, in an interview with Yahoo, Swift further detailed her reasoning behind pulling her albums — “[A]ll I can say is that music is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me like a grand experiment.” With the influx of technology powerhouses like Apple and Beats developing their own radio services, it seems like music streaming is here to stay.
But Swift isn’t the only artist not on Spotify. According to music magazine Spin, other artists including Garth Brooks and Led Zeppelin have also said no to streaming services, citing similar reasoning that Swift does. Swift’s actions obviously aren’t unique, so perhaps Spotify can modify the model in which they pay these musical artists. Independent music artists just starting out are clearly benefitting from the exposure from Spotify but aren’t awarded enough royalties for their work. If music streamers developed a system in which listeners paid a small amount extra across the board, the money could be funneled toward musical artists.
Ultimately, it is still shocking that Swift would leave Spotify. She’s getting the recognition she deserves from critics and consumers alike, cleaning up award shows and establishing record-breaking songs. On top of that, she’s getting compensated for her work, making more in a year than a lot of people would in an entire lifetime. Spotify is quickly becoming an essential, so Taylor, you should’ve known.

On Oct. 28, the president of Zambia, Michael Sata, died in a London hospital a little more than a month after his mysterious absence from a scheduled speech to the United Nations. Though the news of Sata’s death shocked most Zambians — his illness had been kept a secret — something else shocked the rest of the world: Guy Scott, the new interim president, is the first white head of state in Africa in 20 years. Scott’s race, as well as the misplaced fear of the return of “white rule,” has shifted international attention away from far more important issues in Zambia.
Scott, the vice president under Sata, will serve as the interim president until the general election, which must occur within 90 days of the president’s death. Though Scott was born in Zambia (which was the British colony of Northern Rhodesia at the time), his eligibility to run for president is hotly contested because of a constitutional requirement that candidates must be of Zambian descent; Scott’s father emigrated from Scotland in 1927 and his mother emigrated in 1940, both prior to Zambia’s liberation. Despite Scott’s lineage, as well as the fact that less than 0.3 percent of the population is white, Zambians have, for the most part, accepted Scott as just another Zambian.
Tweets, blogs and local newspapers displayed support for Scott in the days following his appointment by the Zambian cabinet to serve as interim president. Chiponda Chimbelu, a Zambian writer for the international online newspaper DW, referred to Scott as a “Zambian patriot.” During the Zambian struggle for independence, both Scott and his father fought for liberation. To many Zambians, the new interim president is considered a “fellow African,” despite his lineage. Nathan Phiri, a bus driver in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, even told Reuters that Scott “is a black man in a white man’s skin. The very fact that we accepted him as vice-president shows that we consider him as one of us.”
Scott’s race, however, has been the center of discussions about Zambia in nearly every country except Zambia itself. International media has primarily focused on the fact that Scott is the first white head of state since F.W. de Klerk, the last leader of apartheid South Africa who was defeated by Nelson Mandela in 1994 in the nation’s first general elections with universal suffrage. In fact, newspapers in Malawi and the United Kingdom — including the Malawi Nyasa Times and London’s The Independent — have even gone as far as to call Scott’s presidency a “return to white rule” in Zambia.
What much of the international media fails to realize, though, is that the frenzy caused by Scott’s appointment has overshadowed not only the death of Sata, but also more important issues facing Zambia.
Though Scott’s race doesn’t pose a threat to the political system of Zambia, his actions as interim president have already led to increased tension within his party, the Patriotic Front, and the country as a whole. Less than a week after the death of President Sata, Scott fired a member of his own party, Secretary General Edgar Lungu, who also served as acting president while Sata was still in the hospital. The following day, Scott released an official statement rescinding his removal of Lungu. Though the official reasons are unknown, the dismissal of Lungu has not only caused tension among party members, but also elicited protests throughout Zambia.
In addition to the recent political turmoil, Zambia continues to face many of the domestic issues traditionally associated with developing countries. As of 2012, 64 percent of Zambians were living below the poverty line, despite the country’s abundant natural resources and high literacy rates. This high poverty level prevents many children from continuing their education, instead pushing them towards lives of unemployment, crime and prostitution. Zambia is one of the top countries most highly affected by HIV/AIDS, with 13.5 percent of the adult population infected.
With the support that he has from fellow Zambians — as well as the extra attention brought by international media — President Scott has the ability to leave a legacy that lasts beyond his 90 days in office. This media blitz might be exactly what Zambia needs in order both to boost its image as a country that fosters cooperation among races, political parties and even countries and to bring renewed attention to the domestic issues plaguing Zambia and its neighbors.
The next few months will be telling to see exactly how much progress has been made in Zambia. The fears about “white rule” are understandable, given the historical context, but the situation in Zambia — how Zambians themselves treat each other, and how they have handled the transition — portrays a more hopeful outlook.
Reverse racism alert, so it’s wrong for an African country to have a white leader that pals around with its people?
“Media shouldn’t focus on new Zambian leader’s race?” Sorry, Maddi, the media focuses on whatever will get their material viewed, read or heard. That gains advertising sales for them, and it is the way they make a living. Count on that, rather than imagining them to be noble, altruistic and kindly, and you will have a more realistic view of the media.
