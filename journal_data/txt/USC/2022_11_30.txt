Chants alternating between the English and Mandarin of “free free China,” “liberty or death” and “no more Xi Jingping” echoed through campus Tuesday night as more than 100 students and community members gathered to remember and mourn victims of an apartment fire that occurred last Thursday and protest China’s zero-COVID policy. 
The trigger for the movement came last week, when a fire ravaged a high-rise apartment building in Urumqi, China, killing 10. The city has been under lockdown for three months and locals allege that the zero-COVID policy contributed to unnecessary deaths. 
The candlelight vigil, held at the entrance to campus on Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street, was run parallel to protests in cities across China. The zero-COVID policy, one of the world’s longest-lasting and strictest coronavirus response plans, enforces indefinite lockdowns on entire communities even if only a handful of cases are found. In some instances, workers have been locked in factories to continue working while under quarantine. 
Emergency services were unable to come close enough to the building to stop the blaze due to cars abandoned in the streets, and though the media has been unable to confirm it, some allege that emergency exits may have been locked or welded shut to enforce the lockdown, trapping residents in the building.
The tragedy inspired Catherine Guo, a junior majoring in interactive media and game design, to attend the vigil. 
“I feel responsible that the place I grew up, the place where my family is, [is] putting people I know and love through this inhumane treatment,” Guo said. “The next fire could wipe out my family.”
Vigils held across China this week to honor the victims quickly turned into protests and spread across the country in a matter of hours, becoming one of the largest protests in China’s history since Tiananmen Square in 1989. Photos of protestors holding blank white sheets of paper went viral worldwide in a protest against the Chinese government’s infamous censorship laws. 
Like those held in China, the vigil for Urumqi victims in front of campus on Tuesday quickly became a protest of the Chinese government as a whole. Students and members of the Los Angeles community gathered in droves with signs and banners to give passionate speeches against the genocide of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, the Chinese government’s crackdown in Hong Kong and government censorship.
Monica Wu, a graduate student studying film production, explained a list of demands of the Chinese government that she had taped to her jacket: to release illegally detailed protestors, investigate what she called unethical PCR testing, stop what many Chinese citizens see as unnecessary lockdowns, and formally apologize for the Urumqi fire.
Han Wang, a graduate student studying data analytics, was a primary organizer of the protest and said he was struck by the level of passion for justice despite China’s notorious crackdowns on protesters.
“It’s really meaningful,” he said when asked what it felt like to see so many USC students at the rally,” Wang said.“For so long, the Chinese students have been, to be honest, not that courageous. Today, they are so brave to just stand or to speak. I’m very happy about that.”
Like protesters in China, who are posting videos upside down to confuse censorship algorithms or hacking through China’s strict internet firewall to organize, the USC community found creative ways to mourn victims of the fire and voice their discontent while keeping international students safe. 
Many attendees wore masks, sunglasses or other face coverings to conceal their identities. When Wang asked who in the crowd was attending their first protest that night, nearly every hand was raised. 
This was Wu’s second protest, the first being the day prior at the Chinese consulate in L.A.
“[Many Chinese people] didn’t grow up in an environment that was safe to [protest in],” she said. “So this is all new to us, and I was very moved tonight.”
Guo recognized the difficulty of the situation and the feelings of helplessness that often accompany controversial issues in China such as censorship, but like Wang and Wu, found hope in how the community came together.
“The Chinese government has been really big on wiping out information,” she said. “So just to be [at this protest], just to remember that this happened, even if it does end up failing … I know we fought, and I think that’s important.”

The Lyon Center gymnasium came to life Tuesday with quick passes and exuberant cheers as the Native American Student Assembly concluded their Native American Heritage Month celebrations with a game of rez ball. 
Short for “reservation ball,” rez ball is a Native American variation of basketball. While it shares many similarities to traditional basketball, it is characterized by a fast and aggressive play style, particularly on the defensive side. Full court pressing, half court traps and forced turnovers are widely regarded key components of the sport — although play styles vary between teams and reservations. 
The sport plays a huge role in Native American culture, which Terrell Mesteth, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said contributed to NASA choosing it for one of their Heritage Month events. 
“Basketball is a huge thing on the reservations,” Mesteth said. “It’s a sport everyone enjoys and knows.”
Tuesday’s event was a pick-up game against the USC Admissions team and provided a way for Native students to celebrate their heritage and culture.
Nizhoni McDonough, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, said colleges in the surrounding area offer a much wider range of opportunities for Native American students than USC.
“Compared to other colleges around us, our Native program isn’t great,” McDonough said. “At Stanford, they have a powwow and they have their own residence for Native Americans. More funding from the higher ups and more support like that would definitely help better [USC] and make it a more welcoming community for Native students here.” 
Mestheth said that along with additional funding for Native American events, it is important for USC to make an active effort to recruit Native American students in their incoming classes — in 2020, only 25 Native American students attended the University.
“It really does start with recruitment, making a place for Natives,” Mestheth said. “I think a lot of Natives don’t come to USC because they don’t know about it, and I think USC definitely has an opportunity to change that.”
Up until last year, USC lacked an official Native American student assembly. This year marks NASA’s first full year of being an assembly, and it already holds an immense amount of significance to Native students on campus. 
“[NASA] is a community for me. It’s like a support group,”said Natalie Battiest, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies. “I think it’s really important to have a community to rely on during the transition into college, especially since the majority of NASA are first-generation students.”
McDonough said that NASA also provides a way to connect with those who share the same culture and background.
“It’s really fulfilling to me to come to a place where there’s a lot of Native Americans, where I share the same cultural heritage and getting to learn more of it,” McDonough said.
Roughly a dozen NASA members participated in the rez ball game, split fairly evenly between those playing and those offering support from the sidelines. As everyone left the court smiling, it certainly seemed to have the desired effect.
NASA’s activities go beyond Native American Heritage Month celebrations. The organization hosts a weekly beading circle every Thursday from 6 p.m to 8 p.m in STU 405, and has already run events such as a career workshop, study nights, and a bowling outing.
“NASA is a great community for Natives,” Mesteth said. “But it’s also more than community, we do more than that. We build a foundation for future Native students.”

There wasn’t a moment of silence inside the Galen Center during Tuesday’s women’s basketball practice. In preparation for their game against California Baptist University on Wednesday, the Trojans were focused on communication and building chemistry between each other; yelling to each other when to switch, when to stay home and when to get help defense on the inside.
“Winning teams are loud teams, winning teams are teams that communicate through all the different scenarios on the floor, so they’ve been working on that,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb.
Now in her second season as the coach of the Trojans, Gottlieb has gotten USC off to their best start to a season since 2018-2019. The culture around USC’s women’s basketball program is on the rise with the help of Gottlieb. Aside from the major recruitment of Juju Watkins coming next year, the Trojans got to work in the transfer portal this year. They added seven transfers to the roster, all of whom have been major contributors already this season. Gottlieb expects the team only to get better as they learn to play with each other as the season progresses.
“With seven transfers, eight new people, we’ve really been intentional about trying to use these games to continue to get better and grow together,” said Gottlieb in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re gonna have to raise our level to be as competitive as we want to be; teams get bigger, stronger, but that’s why we’ve been trying to work on our habits through this non-conference [schedule].”
With a win against the Lancers on Wednesday, USC will be one of the three  teams in the Pac-12 with a perfect six wins to zero losses, alongside University of Arizona and University of Utah. However, it will not be an easy task as this is a Cal Baptist team that won 23 games a season ago. The Trojans hope to get some help in the game from their leading scorer, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko. The transfer from the University of Minnesota is currently averaging 17.8 points per game on over 66 percent shooting.
“Coming to a new team and trying to change the culture and build new habits is obviously a privilege,” said Sissoko. “[My teammates] try to see me when I get open, and it’s just been teamwork, and as of right now, I’ve been successful in that.”
The recipe for USC’s success so far this year has been their strong defense. They currently allow only 48.2 points per game, the fifth-best mark in the entire country. This game against Cal Baptist will test the Trojans’ defense, as the Lancers are one of the top offensive teams in the nation. They currently average 78.3 points per game, the 36th-best average for a Division 1  team. Graduate guard Destiny Littleton, who is third on the team in steals, knows the team will be ready for CBU by the time tip-off comes.
“They’re a dribble drive and kick team, so we gotta make sure that we’re guarding our person one-on-one making sure help side is there while worrying about their three,” said Littleton. “It’s gonna be a tough game. They’re really physical, so we got to come out here and be prepared to hit first.”
USC will take on Cal Baptist on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at  Galen Center.

The Undergraduate Student Government hosted its last senate meeting of the semester this Tuesday, but in the middle of the meeting, the building’s fire alarm went off, prompting all attendees to evacuate.  
Once the meeting reconvened, chief of staff Diego Andrades shared USG protocols according to the crisis response guidelines in the event of an emergency occurring. The last time an emergency took place during a senate meeting was four years ago, when there was a bomb threat reported during USG proceedings.
At the meeting, the senate unanimously voted to incorporate the Joint Assembly of Military-Associated Students, formerly the Military Associated Student Assembly. 
JAMS shared that the reason behind the name change from MASA was the criticism the assembly faced that mispronouncing the name’s acronym evoked ties to slavery; the name change, they decided, would show more inclusion. 
“A lot of people worked together on it when I was a freshman,” said original sponsoring senator Brian Stowe. “There were upperclassmen that were leading the charge and it failed three years in a row, and so to see this finally come to reality is very encouraging and exciting.” 
Senator Yoav Gillath announced that Trojans Give Back will be resuming the dining dollar donation program on Thursday, where students can choose to donate their remaining dining dollars at the end of the semester through the mobile order app. Last May, the organization raised $12,000 to help students facing food insecurity, providing for 32 students to receive 15 meal swipes each week for this school year. 
Assistant Vice Provost for Student Affairs, Student Equity and Inclusion Naddia Palacios came to the meeting to remind students of unifying values as well as the diversity policies around inclusion, including classes on non-discrimination.
Senator Cameron Cornelio presented the collaboration between USC and Leda health, which will provide USC students who have just experienced sexual assault early evidence kits that are self-administered and provide trauma-induced care.
Chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias presented on what the advocacy department has accomplished this semester. The department restructured the role of the advocacy liaison, expanded recruitment to more diverse communities, established the legislative fund for external advocacy projects that could be used by any legislative officer for public projects and met with assembly directors to reevaluate advocacy goals. 
The advocacy department’s upcoming projects include hosting freedom of expression workshops with Student Affairs and Student Equity and Inclusion Programs, creating a centralized reporting system for diversity, equity and inclusion and interpersonal conflicts with campus activities and providing DEI guidelines for programming sponsorships and vendors.
Senator Devin Ayala shared that his goal is to ensure that all students are able to feel supported and part of a campus community that promotes student-led initiatives and goals. He’s working towards this goal by collaborating with groups such as USC Team Awareness Combatting Overdose to provide fentanyl test strips for students, USC Pad in their menstrual products drive and distribution events and the Black Student Assembly in helping to organize the restaurant crawl.
The wellness committee also presented current and future projects, including creating a wellness handbook, increasing access to naloxone training and fentanyl strips and surveying the student population to assess counseling needs and SoundMind, which allows students free access to visual and audio therapy.
Their future projects include continuing to collaborate and have meaningful discussions with DPS, working with DPS and EMT to provide self defense and CPR training, hosting educational and entertainment wellbeing events, providing Resident Assistants on call with Narcan and EpiPens and increasing self-administered kits on campus through Leda Health. 
Vice president Nivea Krishnan presented on future projects for the upcoming semester, including affirmative action advocacy, crisis response guides, culture journey student commitment and DEI within Registered Student Organizations.

Growing pains have been the words of choice to describe the Trojans’ start to the season from those on and around the team. This past week, these growing pains were thrust into the spotlight as USC participated in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, playing against multiple AP-ranked and power five schools. 
“Every game we’ve got better so we just have to take care of the little mistakes and close out games,” said senior guard Boogie Ellis.
They came away from the weekend with one win and two losses, good for a fourth-place finish at the tournament. This puts the Trojans at four wins and three losses on the season, as they now get a small sampling of conference play with two straight Pac-12 matchups in the next week.
USC started off the weekend with a promising win against Brigham Young University with the help of Ellis who tied his career-high with 27 points. The Trojans then put up a great fight against now No. 13 University of Tennessee, losing in overtime to the Vols. The third-place game against Wisconsin was a back-and-forth affair, with the 10 lead changes, but a crucial turnover with 15 seconds left while down three sealed USC’s fate. 
One of the bright spots from the tournament was Ellis, who has seemed to come into his own offensively. Overall he has had a strong start to the season, currently averaging the third most points in the entire Pac-12. He elevated his play even more in the tournament this past week. Across the three games, Ellis averaged 21 points per game on 51 percent shooting from the field and 40 percent from three. Ellis knows the team isn’t far away from putting all the pieces together and coming out with wins instead of losses in these close games.
“I feel like we could be a lot better you know, especially in late-game situations, I feel like I could be better especially being a point guard on the floor,” said Ellis in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
From the start of the season, it was known that the Trojans might take a few games to find their identity as a team, but they showed significant improvement at the tournament despite the two losses. The Trojans are shooting more efficiently from the field and have finally woken up from the three-point line. 
Before the tournament, as a team, they were shooting 30% from behind the line, but in their final two games of the tournament, they reached 42%. USC hopes to keep this sharp shooting and strong play going when they take on University of California, Berkeley, who currently has the 276th-ranked three-point defense in division one.
“Everybody in our program knows that we could have won both games [at the tournament]… but when the lights are on Wednesday, we have to be a better and more disciplined offensive team with more patience,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield. “Cal’s a very dangerous team at home, they have good players, an outstanding coach and it’s a road game any road game in this league is tough doesn’t matter who you play.”
The Golden Bears are having a rough start to the season themselves, as they have yet to get a win in seven contests and have even lost to the likes of Texas State and UC Davis. USC and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson will be looking to use this game against Berkely to start their conference schedule on the right note. Peterson has been helping lead the team this year with his playmaking ability, tied for tenth in the nation in assists per game. The only problem is he and USC have a turnover problem, as Peterson is also tied for sixth in the country in turnovers per game.
“I’m really trying to work on being efficient with assists, but not also high turnovers, they cancel out if I got six assists, but six turnovers, doesn’t really matter,” said Peterson. “We’re gonna continue to battle and sometimes, you know the dice doesn’t fall your way…but going into conference play this week we’re expecting to come out 2-0 that’s what we’re gonna be hungry for and we know we need to take care of business.”
The Trojans will be taking on Cal at the Haas Pavilion on Wednesday at 8 p.m., but then come back to the Galen Center on Sunday to face Oregon State at 4 p.m.

It’s almost bowl season, folks! As the business end of the season arrives, we’ll be watching the conference clashes that could determine the College Football Playoff participants this weekend. Just tuning in to college football for the first time all year after a deep sports hibernation? Have no fear. I’m here to give you the rundown on America’s top ten teams. We’re not looking at their on-the-field performances, though. To really give your friends the impression that you have a deep understanding of the sport, we’re going to arm you with mascot ratings. 
#10 Clemson Tigers
Fresh off a loss to a surging South Carolina last weekend, the Clemson Tiger looks like he hasn’t slept in a week. He’s got oddly human eyes and a football jersey that looks like it hasn’t been washed since Clemson’s last CFP appearance in 2021. It seems like the designers of this costume gave up halfway down the torso. They ran out of fabric near the bottom too, so you can spot the shoes of the poor sod underneath the costume.
Rating: 3/10. Needs improvement.
#9 Washington Huskies
Washington went for another human-like look in Harry the Husky. Unlike their Clemson counterparts, this mascot nails it. I’m a big fan of the purple and gold combo. The oversized head creates a fun cartoon-style effect, and the eyebrows are a nice touch. Even better, this mascot walks around with an actual husky named Dubs on game days in Seattle. My only complaint is that, at first glance, I thought Harry was a bear. 
Rating: 8/10. Like a popsicle in July.
#8 Penn State Nittany Lions
I’m at a loss for words to describe this one. This costume could be right out of “Creep” (2014). The soulless gaze pairs nicely with the 4 canines to create a look that’s gotta be near the worst in the country. I’m not alone in thinking that either, as the mascot has consistently ranked near the bottom of national polls. If any Nittany Lions are reading this, please do something.
Rating: 2/10. Irredeemable.
#7 Tennessee Volunteers
The most realistic of the AP top 10’s costumed contenders, Smokey the Bluetick Coonhound is a strong addition to these rankings. A pronounced set of jowls leaves no doubt about the identity of this mascot. He’s got a stately stare that gives you the impression you could trust him to be your financial advisor. Adding accurate paws and muscled legs to the bottom of the costume does wonders for the realism factor.
Rating 7.5/10. About as good as Tennessee’s onfield performance this year.
#6 Alabama Crimson Tide
Big Al the Elephant is a solidly mid-tier mascot. I appreciate the outside-the-box thinking of making an elephant the mascot of a school in Alabama, but I just can’t get behind that boa constrictor of a trunk. I’m all for overdoing it, but his trunk should not be hitting his knees when he sprints through the endzone.
Rating: 6/10. A foot of trunk away from a 7/10.
#5 Ohio State Buckeyes
No.
Rating 1/10.
#4 USC Trojans
Entering the top 4 this week, USC has got an edge over its college football contemporaries. With the only live mascot in the bunch, the Trojans have cornered the market on realism. Traveler IX the white horse is the eighth8th in a proud line of Trojan spirit leaders. His majestic white mane contrasts beautifully with tar-black hooves and a gray snout. The horse’s third- quarter lap around the field is a unique tradition in the sport and makes good use of the Coliseum’s Olympic cauldron near the end of the routine.
Rating: 9/10. Horsing around.
#3 TCU Horned Frogs
This mascot has a lot of fans around the country. I’m not one of them. I think it’s a weird caricature of a horned frog that looks more alien than amphibian. There are way too many spikes and the long eyes make this SuperFrog look permanently shocked. 
Rating: 2.5/10. As likable as burnt toast.
#2 Michigan Wolverines
Michigan hasn’t had a mascot since the 1927 season when legendary head coach Fielding Yost attempted to bring two live wolverines to games against Ohio State and Navy. In a surprise that no one could have seen coming, bringing two of the most vicious animals alive to a stadium packed end-to-end with roaring football fans didn’t quite end well.
Rating: 0/10.
#1 Georgia Bulldogs
Of any mascot on this list, Hairy Dawg the Bulldog is the only one I would trust to produce on the field for his team. The mascot is absurdly muscled in his upper body. Rumor has it Kirby Smart has this bulldog in the gym with his linemen every morning.
Rating: 10/10. I wanted to give a lower score but he might show up at my door.

After USC’s win against UCLA this season, junior defensive end Tuli Tuipulotu declared this season the Trojans’ “revenge tour.”
“We need our get backs from a lot of the teams that disrespected us last year,” he said. 
Tuipulotu can check Notre Dame off that revenge tour list. Facing Utah in the Pac-12 Championship Game on Friday, USC has the chance to get revenge, win a conference title for the first time since 2017 and potentially qualify for the College Football Playoff for the first time. 
It’s a unique team and fans know it. Saturday night against the Irish, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was packed, the best atmosphere of the season and in recent memory. 
The hype left behind from the Trojans’ victory over the Bruins carried over Thanksgiving week. 
The crowd oohed and aahed with every sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams juke and run. Chants of “Heisman, Heisman, Heisman,” broke out multiple times during the night. The 72,613 fans in attendance were the most of the season. 
“I don’t know how long it’s been since it was like that, I haven’t been here before, but man it was electric in there,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley in a post game press conference Saturday. “To see the Coli like that, see our team playing the way we did… We played really well [on] all three sides of the ball.”
Now with a quick turnaround, USC will hope much of its play against Notre Dame will carry over to the Utes. Here are three takeaways from the Trojans’ explosive win over the Irish. 
Caleb Williams’ Heisman Hype
Like Jay-Z once rapped: “What more can I say?” There were the Heisman poses, the crowning on the sidelines and the elusive pocket awareness. 
If you didn’t buy into Williams’ Heisman stock before Saturday’s game, the price is taking off. Williams electrified the Coliseum with four total touchdowns — three on the ground, one in the air for a performance that will etch him in the Heisman conversation for weeks to come. 
Williams was simply magnificent, throwing for 232 yards on an 81.8% completion percentage. He had the highest quarterback rating of his college career too with 97.6. Williams now has at least eight games with four total touchdowns, a testament to his consistency. 
It was the right place, the right time for a Heisman moment too. A nationally televised game on ABC saw Williams play his best game of the year. 
His wizardry in the pocket was on full display as he bobbed and weaved to extend plays and escape sacks. The quarterback credited his dad with instilling that mindset. 
“My dad from when I was younger and when I first started playing quarterback to now with coach, we have a rule of take what’s in front of you and if it’s not there, scan the field,” Williams said. “And he also reminds me that I’m a little bit athletic. So sometimes [I] take off.”
Take off he did, as Williams broke multiple records throughout the night. 
His 44 total touchdowns this season are the most ever by a USC quarterback in a single year. His 351 rushing yards are the most in a season by any USC quarterback ever. The Trojans have been playing football for over 100 years. 
Oh, and Williams also punted the ball twice, including the longest one of the season for USC — a 58-yarder. 
“Hopefully, we don’t have to punt anymore,” Riley said. 
“I had the longest punt of the season though,” said Williams immediately after. 
“It was a good punt, it was a good punt,” said Riley with a chuckle. 
What could Williams not do Saturday night?
The Trojans are clicking at the right time and might have their eighth (counting Reggie Bush) Heisman winner. 
Defense stops the run and reaches the turnover mark
Prior to the season, new defensive coordinator Alex Grinch set a preseason goal of forcing 24 turnovers in the season. USC forced 19 last season with a defense that gave up over 40 points four times. 
Well, Grinch’s goal was reached after an interception and a fumble recovery put the Trojans’ forced turnovers at 26 — the highest total since the 2005 and 2004 seasons, the latter of which was USC’s last National Championship. 
Does this mean the Trojans win the title this year? Probably not, but pair that with their suddenly strong run defense and it’s a great combination. 
USC’s defense heard it all going into Saturday’s matchup. 
The college football chairman said the Trojans’ defense is what is holding them back in the CFP rankings. San Jose Mercury News columnist Jon Wilner tweeted last Friday that the Irish “is going to rush for 850 yards.”
Notre Dame didn’t, reaching only 90 yards rushing, only Ohio State and Navy allowed fewer rushing yards to the Irish. It was another boost to USC’s defense after it kept UCLA’s run game in check the week before.
Grinch pointed out that the “film is the film” regarding the Trojans’ problems on defense. He believes there is still work to be done, particularly against Utah Friday, which Grinch said the defense has to do “everything” better to win. 
But, he was proud of the players for not “sinking in” with all the noise about Notre Dame’s run game.
“This thing goes a completely different way if we’re not able to stop the run, so proud of the front seven,” he said.
Austin Jones impresses
It’s been a whirlwind of a season for senior running back Austin Jones. After a strong start to the year, Jones became buried in the depth chart, never eclipsing five carries in a game for five straight games.
But after the injury to redshirt senior Travis Dye, Jones has come alive, notching a career high in rushing with 154 on the ground against Notre Dame. 
Riley repeatedly mentions that no one on the team is surprised by Jones’ production, the ultimate compliment to a player who said he just tried to stay ready. 
“I love this game. I love this team. And no matter what I told them at the beginning of the season, I’m going to give whatever I got no matter what I got to do,” Jones said. “I just want to go out and have fun.”
His emergence in the run game maintains an important layer to this offense, many of which thought would take a hit without Dye. Riley though said Jones’ running was a huge difference-maker in the win.
“Austin has stepped up and boy he ran physical [Saturday]. I mean you talk about establishing the run game, that to me was the game,” he said.

This column installment is going to be a bit niche. But it’s my final article of the semester, so it needs to be done. 
It’s time to discuss Jake Novak: the man, the myth, the legend, the “next ‘SNL’ cast member.” 
For those not familiar with the name, Novak is an aspiring comedian who post(ed) weekly music videos on TikTok such as a butchered meme version of Alanis Morissette’s “Hand in My Pocket” and an acapella version of “My Money Don’t Jiggle,” which plays exactly as it sounds. 
His career was going about as well as it could until one fateful day in June, when Novak posted his infamous “I wanna be the next ‘SNL’ cast member” video. The video was a rap-musical-theater-style plea to “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels begging to be awarded a position on the sketch show. Describing himself as being like “Lin-Manuel Miranda mixed with Sammy-berg,” Novak lists some of his credentials intermixed with a few jokes that fell very flat.
Now, we are nearing the six-month anniversary of that TikTok, which means this article may not be entirely timely. But in my life, Novak is a constant. As I go about my day, Novak pops into my mind, and then I’m sad.
It’s just like those times you remember a faux pas from your own life and have to take a few minutes to question your purpose on Earth. The thought of the time I brought one of my friends birthday card shopping for a different friend on her birthday continues to bring me physical pain… sorry, Sam. 
Since the fateful video, Novak hasn’t posted. The promised weekly music videos have faded into a distant memory. 
While devastating, it’s understandable why Novak chose to take a break from the internet. The responses to the video were ruthless. And, there’s really no kind way to say this, but the video was embarrassing. It was corny, just like the rest of his content. Still, the punishment did not fit the crime. 
Having to stop sharing the work he is passionate about is bad enough, but people began seeking him out at his workplace: Disneyland, a place that has been previously accused of firing employees for breaking character when they go viral. He clearly isn’t getting his dream job at “SNL,” but now his current job is also in danger, all because he tried to shoot his shot. 
I don’t want to pretend that I was above the hate. The Novak lore was an absolute highlight in my summer media consumption, and I definitely laughed at all the mean videos. But, what gives me the right to do that? As they say, “those who can, do. Those who can’t, criticize.” 
I’m not a performer. I would never be bold enough to put myself out there like Novak did. The world would be nothing without creative people, and the way to discover those people is through their willingness to be vulnerable. Novak’s boldness and slight overconfidence is something that should be admired. 
While I write this, I don’t want to defend Novak too much. There isn’t a lot of information on him, and some of his past videos are… questionable to say the least. The rap about gun violence that posited “laughing feels wrong” should have probably been avoided. 
On a less serious note, his style of humor simply does not align with mine. For this article, I selflessly subjected myself to Novak’s entire repertoire of content, which I had not actually watched since around August. With videos like “He wants a ticket to the [Itty Bitty Titty Committee]… from a nice guy’s perspective,” I find it hard to defend him with my whole heart. 
Still, the comments before the “SNL” video gave Novak a lot of support. Without getting too sappy, seeing those comments warmed my heart — they reminded me of the good parts of comedy. 
Clearly, I am passionate about comedy, so much so that I spend my time writing articles about it. However, somewhere along the way, I think I may have forgotten why I love it. This is my last article of the semester, which also marked my first semester as a editor. I feel as though I have a right to get a little cliché. 
Comedy is an incredibly powerful tool. The art form is meant to draw out laughter, one of the most wonderful things a person can experience. Take a moment to think about the last thing that made you laugh, and just savor the pure joy of the moment. Laughter is freeing. 
While it is vital to call out the problematic events that take place in the world of comedy, sometimes, it’s nice to step back and remember all the happiness brought by comedy. 
While watching a “nice guy” rap made me close my laptop and reflect a bit on the choices I made to arrive at this point in my life, some people out there got a little bit of joy out of it. Who am I to fault them? 
As everyone everywhere always says: comedy is subjective. Although, as I said, some of his work is questionable, but for the most part, at least as much of it as I have seen, it isn’t egregiously offensive. Life gets tough, and sometimes the only way to power through is with a laugh. So, if someone is able to find that in “nice guy” Jake Novak’s content, then I call that a win.

This semester saw a wealth of new reads which left audiences with no excuse not to pick them up. Exploring every genre, this roundup includes riveting young adult titles, explosive fantasies, heart-tearing romances and everything in between. While every book released this past fall deserves a highlight, these ten stood out for their craft and high achievements. 
“It Starts with Us“by Colleen Hoover
Written by Colleen Hoover, “It Starts With Us” is the sequel to “It Ends With Us” and follows the lives of main characters Lilly Bloom and Atlas Corrigan through dual perspective narration. Against its story about a second chance at love and the struggles of navigating PTSD and haunting abuse, “It Starts With Us” is a quick and heart-felt read. The book currently sits at #1 on The New York Times’ Best Sellers list, along with over seven of Hoover’s other works — something of a NYT darling, her works simultaneously held six of the top ten spots on the paperback fiction list in October of this year. 
“Fairy Tale” by Stephen King
Stephen King never fails to produce epic and chilling works, descriptions which both fit his newest novel, “Fairy Tale.” The book follows the story of 17-year-old Charlie Reade, who finds a magical key to another realm and himself at the head of a battle between good and evil. Having already acquired film rights with Universal Pictures, King has once again outdone himself with “Fairy Tale” and its dark fantasy spanning 608 pages. 
“The Twist of a Knife” by Anthony Horowitz
Fall is a time for mystery, and as his fourth novel in the series, Anthony Horowitz released “The Twist of a Knife,” the story of an author (a fictionalized version of himself) who is falsely accused of murder and relies on the help of a detective to prove his innocence. Able to be read as a standalone, “The Twist of a Knife” presents an original take on the mystery genre and utilizes Horowitz’s true, captivating voice as he travels throughout the story.
“Our Missing Hearts” by Celeste Ng
Celeste Ng’s “Our Missing Hearts” has been a highly anticipated follow-up to her last two novels. It tells the story of a 12-year old named Bird on a quest to find his mother. Imbued with the power of voice and grappled by grief, the quasi-dystopian novel ultimately portrays the unbreakable bond between mother and child in a society overrun with fear.  
“Foul Lady Fortune” by Chloe Gong
As the first book in her new duology, Chloe Gong’s “Foul Lady Fortune” exceeded expectations. The speculative historical thriller follows a pair of spies in 1930’s Shanghai, posing as a married couple to investigate a string of murders. Following popular tropes, such as enemies to lovers and fake marriage, Gong’s writing was a sure hit on BookTok and flew up the NYT Best Sellers lists. 
“Friends, Lovers, and The Big Terrible Thing” by Matthew Perry
Beloved actor Matthew Perry opens up about his struggles with addiction and shares behind-the-scenes memories from the hit show “Friends” in his memoir “Friends, Lovers, and The Big Terrible Thing.” Taking his readers on a journey through childhood ambition to fame to addiction and recovery, Perry details how his life choices impacted his future. The story is both eye-opening and riddled with humor. While a gift to fans, the book also extends a hand to anyone struggling with sobriety and provides positive reinforcement for those in similar situations to Perry. 
“Now is Not the Time to Panic” by Kevin Wilson
From the NYT Best Selling author of “Nothing to See Here,” “Now is Not the Time to Panic” shares the story of two teenage misfits who meet one summer and create art that would change their lives forever. Kevin Wilson’s trademark wit is heavily utilized as he explores the nuances of young love, identity and art. The coming-of-age-story emphasizes the weight of secrets and the power of setting them free. 
“The Mother I Never Had” by Gary Goldstein
Gary Goldstein forces his audience to consider the choices they would make and the emotions they would deal with if they found themselves faced with a parent they never knew existed in “The Mother I Never Had.” Still handling the grief of the passing of his father, main character Nate Cronin is approached by mysterious Amy who sends him on a devastating journey to unravel the past. Grappling with years of secrets and lies, Goldstein’s heartfelt novel explores the psychological minefield of loss and new beginnings.
“Lucy by The Sea” by Elizabeth Strout
Elizabeth Strout highlights the struggles and fears of isolation through her novel “Lucy by the Sea.” The story details a divorced couple who stays together during lockdown and the complexities of their past in a small house beside the sea. Riddled with empathy and emotion, the novel emphasizes the deep human connections that unite us, even when we are apart. 
“The Old Place” by Bobby Finger
As Bobby Finger’s debut novel, “The Old Place” centers around a wry retired schoolteacher whose decade-old secret threatens to come to light and send shockwaves through her small, Texan town. The LGBTQIA+-friendly book is both tenderhearted and moving and keeps the audience at the edge of their seats with continuous big reveals.

The opening shot of Joanna Hogg’s excellent new film “The Eternal Daughter” depicts a porcelain-skinned Julie, played by Tilda Swinton, staring longingly out the window of a quaint taxicab, her gaze drilled into the darkness of a never-ending forest overlain with thick clouds of fog. Her reflection emerges from the depths of this darkness before the camera cuts to a much older Rosalind (also played by Swinton) sitting right across from her younger counterpart. 
Rosalind lasers her focus on Julie’s furrowed brow, paying close attention to the worry stored in the wrinkles of her face that appear on her own as well. It is here that revisions of a tale as old as time begin to play out; this film shows its concern with interrogating mother-daughter relationships at every turn, though it is abundantly clear that Julie and Rosalind are fragmented mirror images of one another, through form and performance. 
“The Eternal Daughter,” written and directed by Hogg in her third feature for A24 and co-produced by the one and only Martin Scorsese, is in many ways a spiritual successor to her “The Souvenir” films. However, it firmly establishes its own place in her filmography, mostly as a hauntingly melancholic ode to her relationship with her 94-year-old mother. The film centers on Julie, the daughter of Rosalind, taking her mother to her former family home, which has been converted into a hotel. During her stay, Julie attempts to write her next film whilst confronting ghastly spirits and occurrences around the hotel. At the heart of the film is an inquisition into what it means to Hogg to be a filmmaker and what that requires she takes from those around her and those she loves. 
Shot in secret in Wales during the pandemic, Hogg had to assemble an incredibly tiny cast and crew. From these circumstances, one of the film’s greatest assets was born: Swinton’s dual performances as both mother and daughter. Swinton, who has firmly established herself as one of Hollywood’s most deeply idiosyncratic heavyweights, has never been one to shy away from a challenge. This is not the first time Swinton has assumed disparate roles in the same film; Luca Guadagnino’s “Suspiria” (2018) marked that occasion. Swinton is the soul of “The Eternal Daughter”; it is a treat to observe her masterfully inhabit two completely different characters constantly in conversation with one another, reckoning with various feelings of inadequacy relative to each other. 
Hogg interpolates tried and true supernatural horror tropes to create an unmistakably eerie yet oddly intimate and comforting film. For a film that explicitly deals in paranormal phenomena, it is a testament to Hogg’s cinematic expertise that there is a cozy levity for viewers to settle into here. Part of this is accomplished through Hogg’s wonderful sense of humor, largely written into the character of a laughably curt hotel receptionist, played excellently by newcomer Carly-Sophia Davies. The hotel itself also functions as an almost living, breathing entity interacting with the few characters that occupy it; Hogg shoots it with a keen attention to detail and spatial awareness that enhances the unease the film conjures in viewers, especially in its first half. 
Every step Julie takes as she attempts to locate the source of unknown noises echoes throughout the cavernous building, inspiring creaks, squeaks and clangs that sonically contribute to a seemingly profound emptiness. Earnest portraits of English aristocrats dutifully watch over the corridors of the hotel, their eyes piercingly gazed upon the only guest that dares to roam its halls. 
Low-angle shots of the hotel’s central mahogany staircase bestow upon it an imposing nature and provide the hotel with an unmistakable spirit, along with the fog that hangs in the air outside like an ethereal cloak. Hogg uses her robust cinematic lexicon to express the film’s plentiful themes surrounding familial relations and creative production, always maintaining a masterful balance between the ominous, humorous and somber.
Much of the film’s premise, aloof cinematography and lavishly haunted production design pay homage to Stanley Kubrick’s all-time classic “The Shining” (1980). Where that film continually veers into terrifying territory, however, this one forges a path that paints an increasingly desperate picture of an artist in a state of personal crisis. “The Eternal Daughter” affords Swinton plenty of space to flex her acting muscles and Hogg to playfully experiment with the conventions of your typical ghost story, and it doubles as a welcome addition to A24’s recent parent-child relationship drama canon.

One of my earliest childhood memories of unreasonable mental strife happened in the laundry room of my red bricked childhood home. It was a birthday party for one of the kids on my block, and for some reason, four-year-old me was losing her fucking mind at the prospect of having to socialize with an anthromorphic tiger mascot and making glib small talk over a fluorescent pink cake with my fellow preschool peers. Thus, I ran circles in my laundry room until I mustered up the courage to cross the street. 
Another core memory consists of locking myself in the third grade bathroom for over an hour when one of my classmates threw up into the recycling bin (with better aim, maybe he would have chosen the compost bin, a thought for next time), paralyzed with fear. Emetophobia was its name, and made me into the asshole who routinely avoided taking care of their friends when they had over indulged. 
Experiences like these are ever commonplace, and much more commonly discussed and accepted now than when I was a kid. Mental health issues have risen in recent years, by 13% in the past decade, with 20% of  children and adolescents living with mental illness. Concurrently, prescription of mental health medication has seen an uptick, with 1 in 5 Americans taking some form of mental health medication. It’s clear that mental health issues are prevalent in our country, but these are often difficult to diagnose or treat  due to the high costs of treatment. 
As with everything else, enter social media. TikToks that have bylines such as “Things You Didn’t Know Were Symptoms of ADHD” with a “therapist” or simply just someone trying to produce content pointing to glowing words of a conglomerate of general symptoms have proliferated into the digital sphere. 
There seems to be a rise in jargon and diagnoses being tossed around, a shift to making everything clinical. When there is something off kilter, some atypical behavior, it must be indicative of some greater problem, some diagnosable cause fixed by a cocktail of pharmaceuticals that serve for more of a quick fix than the active unlearning of habits and mindset through therapy. The latter, of course, being a privilege most cannot afford. 
It is possible to find comfort in words and diagnosis, a flat answer, an explanation as to why we behave certain ways. One can find solace but also hyper diagnose.
Could these symptoms not just be a greater reflection of our society at large? At one that requires us to work to the bare bone in order to succeed? One that requires optimization? This world is tiring, confusing and full of conflicts and stressors to cause strife, sometimes causing more strife than usual. Thus, it makes sense that people would take a grab bag of DSM-V words that help explain the unexplainable.
Did you see a licensed professional? Or did you just see a pastel pink infographic with a glorified horoscope of your mental health diagnosis? Generalizing symptoms and throwing around words is damaging and can cause some of these words to lose meaning. 
These, of course, also serve as successful marketing tactics. As Don Draper states in “Mad Men,” advertising is happiness. If one is deeply convinced of their life being terrible, they will buy into any solution. While writing this, I went to my Instagram explore page, to a post stating “Signs it’s getting unhealthy again…” The signs, of course, were followed by a push to purchase a self help book. A general sentiment of unhappiness sure as hell serves as a great way to push product. 
I deleted TikTok at the beginning of this year, knowing well enough I had been reading into these posts too much. Yet, the cookies in my phone had gained all information necessary for any account with a Canva subscription to light up my Instagram explore page with infographics so lovingly informing me what trauma looks like and what to do with an insecure attachment style. 
Sandwiched in between a duck playing drums with its feet and an infographic telling me how many calories to cut until I hate myself just a bit less are helpful twelve step programs on “How to love someone with OCD” and what quirks in my personality might actually be a trauma response or ADHD symptoms. 
Deeply convinced I had some other harrowing mental health affliction, I completed neuropsychological testing this past summer, needing to verify that I had ADHD. But no, I did not, it was simply a manifestation of my concurrent anxiety, symptoms that would subside once I dealt with the pesky worms in my brain convincing myself of my inadequacy and causing my hands to unreasonably perspire. 
In a plague of insecurity and a lack of clarity, power can be found through words, labels and orange pill bottles for better and for worse. I can now hold my friend’s hair back and talk myself down from delusions thanks to cognitive behavioral therapy — something I don’t think the Lexapro initially suggested could have accomplished the same way that unlearning thought processes does. 
Yet I have also learned playing with hair ties at eighth grade assemblies isn’t indicative of a focus problem. As discussed by Jessica Bennett in The New York Times, if everything is indicative of harm, of trauma, of some greater problem, is anything? We are complex beings with experiences and imperfect traits, not just at least 5 of 9 symptoms from a subset.

My soul is hurting for the 23 victims of the Colorado LGBTQIA+ Shooting, five of whom will never experience another moment of joy. My soul aches thinking about their final moments of terror, as they realized the reclamation of their Queerness and how it exists in space would be their final mode of existence. My heart rips thinking about their loved ones, how they are currently yearning to dance with their spouses, longing to interlock fingers, unable to process that their friends, lovers and partners are dead.
It’s sickening that this shooting took place on the dawn of Transgender Day of Remembrance. The shooter reminds us that we can’t mourn the last cohort of lives that were wrongfully taken before we face the next. And we can’t be fully present in centering the resilience of Trans lives, because we must also be resilient for ourselves. There is confusion as to where we should look. There are so many places. Inward, outward, onward. But nothing really cures the fact that society is perpetually moving backward. 
I don’t know what to say or think. I don’t know how to keep moving forward without feeling that I am an undeserving beneficiary of luck or protection. But, I feel pride knowing members of my community died dancing, in the presence of group love and pop music. They died with dignity, and this is how I too pray to go. They died taking up space, something I am trying to do every day. For that, they will forever be my guiding Angels, the deities of my unreligious life. 
They remind me that Queerness extends beyond myself and how I take up space. It is about finding who has been othered, sidelined, stepped on, and centering them. It is through heartbreaking moments like this that I’m reminded existing in Queer space will always be a radical act — an unfinished one at that. Queerness won’t be entirely realized until it is unapologetically everywhere, and thus my existence as a member of the Queer community isn’t fully realized. 
Last month, in honor of LGBTQIA+ History month, I created the Trans and Queer Media Project. Saddened by the heinous ways Trans characters are relentlessly crafted as murderers, pedophiles and victims of violence, I wanted to create a project aimed at centering positive, joyful representations of Trans and Queer folks. The media project is a giant piece of butcher paper, covered in images from movies, shows, actors, musicians and other types of media. 
It is hung in the Student Workroom of the LGBTQ+ Student Center. I’m hoping to donate it to the ONE archives, USC’s LGBTQ+ Archive, once it is finished. 
In the past month at the LGBTQ+ Center, we also hosted three programs for the project. The most recent was a screening of the movie “Tangerine” (2015), a golden depiction of an evening with two Los Angeles-based Trans sex workers. It was a beautiful way for everyone, both inside and outside of the Trans community to learn. To hold space. Five people came to the program, our highest turnout yet. I could cry thinking about how gratifying it was to have people show up for the event. That experience gave me a glimpse into what it might be like to be Trans in America. To feel that nobody or at most five people could show up. 
As I balance aiming to locate Queer joy for myself — wanting it to be a private matter that is sacred to my body — with the reality that Trans and Queer people have been and will continue to be disproportionately violated, I am brought back to the wise words of José Esteban Muñoz. I am reminded that I am not yet Queer, I am only verging on the horizon of Queerness. As his book is titled, we are only “Cruising Utopia.” I do not yet know Queer joy, I only know moments of it. 
Finding Queerness will be deeply intertwined with lifting some of the world’s largest burdens for me. From the rampant anti-Blackness that continues to kill — and affect society in every way possible — to the lack of protection and solidarity in society for sex workers. From the way we sideline and ignore people facing neurodivergence, disability and chronic pain to the way we perpetually make dark, fat and short people feel undesirable. The way these issues culminate for Black Trans sex workers who end up disproportionately sexually abused, homeless, and hurt. These issues, as stated by Queer Black women for decades — are deeply intertwined; none of us are free until all of us are.
Sometimes it feels that I am too privileged and too far-removed to have a stake in this game. I hurt for other people, but how much can I really understand? Positionality matters. My lack of first-hand experience with many nuanced and deeply complicated issues and identities limits my perspective. But ultimately, it is my empathy that will allow me to seek understanding. My traumatizing experiences — to me at least — are a deeply valuable tool. They give me insight as to how it feels. 
I will continue to pull people in who know more than me and I will never be fully realized. That is my commitment in this deeply confusing, angering, sad world. 
To all the Queer and Trans people taking up space, you deserve space and energy and your Queerness deserves nourishment — whatever that looks like. Go blow some bubbles, kiss your hand, and never stop checking in on the people you love. And to the non-Queer, cis, het folks, take a moment to look into our eyes before you violate us. Consider — even just for a moment — our humanity. It can change everything.

Rising cases of respiratory syncytial virus are causing experts to warn of a “tripledemic” alongside influenza and coronavirus. California hospitals, especially children’s hospitals, are already strained by cases of the latter and are being stretched thin by RSV. Detections of the virus in the state jumped in late October, exceeding last year’s five week average peak by almost twice as much.
“For adults, RSV is like a cold virus, so must adults with RSV are never going to seek medical attention, are never going to need medical attention, and honestly aren’t going to be tested for it,” said Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman, during a briefing Tuesday with the Daily Trojan. “The issue is that when it infects very young children, or the very elderly, it can cause very serious disease.”
RSV in infants and older adults can cause bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the airways which can cause trouble breathing and could require hospitalization for treatment, Van Orman said. Individuals living with chronic lung diseases are also at risk.
“Keeping yourself healthy as an adult is the best way that you’re going to prevent passing it to your kid,” Van Orman said of preventative measures.
Drug Take Back Day is returning to campus Dec. 6, USC Student Health announced on their website. The event, jointly hosted by Student Health and USC Pharmacies, will allow students to safely dispose of expired or otherwise unwanted drugs at various locations on campus, no questions asked.
“It’s a good reminder, as you’re cleaning out your dorm room or your apartment, to make sure that you properly dispose of any drugs,” Van Orman said. 
This ensures “they’re not entering the [waste stream] supply or getting into people’s hands for whom they’re not prescribed,” she said.
The event comes one month after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration hosted a National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on Oct. 29. Nationwide events associated with the day are “an opportunity for Americans to prevent drug addiction and overdose deaths,” according to Student Health’s announcement.
Students can drop off expired or unwanted drugs at three locations on campus: the University Park Campus Health Center Pharmacy, the Health Sciences Campus Medical Plaza Pharmacy and the Verdugo Hills Professional Pharmacy.
With Winter Break on the horizon, Van Orman said during the briefing that Student Health’s recommendations for travel remain unchanged: testing before departure, wearing a mask if in a crowded environment or exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness, maintaining hand hygiene and staying updated on influenza and coronavirus vaccinations.
“For many people, [winter break] is a period of adjustment,” Van Orman said. “Being home can be a wonderful time, a relaxing time, but it also can bring new challenges and stresses as people readjust to a variety of family and home environments.”
Student Health saw 153 coronavirus cases the week ending Nov. 28, a slight decrease from 177 the week prior as expected due to Thanksgiving break. 2.6% of visits to Student Health during that period were for influenza-like illness, also an expected decrease from 3.3% the week prior. Student Health could not provide updated numbers on influenza and coronavirus booster vaccination rates at USC, citing technical issues in obtaining the data.
This past weekend saw unexpected developments in China as mass protests erupted over the state’s “zero-Covid” policy, which continues to enforce extensive lockdowns, mass testing, and quarantine periods in government facilities. The unrest as citizens blamed coronavirus protocol for a fire in Xinjiang Saturday that killed ten people, including three children. 
Van Orman spoke to the implications of the policy and subsequent protests on public health, saying the conflict exemplified the importance of “balancing risks versus the benefits.”
“We’ve known for a while now that we are going to, in essence, have to learn to live with it,” Van Orman said of the coronavirus. “We have tools to manage it as an endemic virus: keeping up high rates of vaccination, continuing to develop effective antivirals, using masks, and using source control during periods of high transmission, using moderate levels of isolation for people that are infected.”

At USC, there are two kinds of fight clubs: those you talk about, and those you don’t. The Daily Trojan visited fighting clubs around campus to learn more about fighting culture at USC.
Over Halloweekend, students gathered around Parkside Residential Hall to witness a friendly street fight transpire between two freshmen girls. The informal brawl, while not officially sanctioned by the school, offered a peek into the unique combat culture around campus.
Isaiah Alwin, a freshman majoring in journalism, was a close friend of the two contenders and helped organize the match. According to Alwin, the girls agreed to a boxing match to settle a friendly feud and were not seeking blood.
“Of course, it was a joke; they didn’t actually want to beat each other up,” Alwin said. “It was purely for entertainment purposes.”
Around fifty students attended the skirmish, Alwin said, circling around the competitors as they traded punches. The two girls fought for three 90-second rounds before one eventually surrendered.
“The hits were flying,” Alwin said. “[But] it was mostly theatrical. There was more going into the build-up and presentation than the actual fight … no one was seriously hurt.”
Alwin supports friendly fights as a means of recreation or competition, so long as it is safe and consensual. He said fighting should be treated no differently than competing in a game of pickup basketball.
“I think people should be allowed to host a boxing match if they’re so inclined, and everyone is willing to participate,” Alwin said.
While the street scene offers an unconventional outlet for combat sports, USC hosts several University-sanctioned fighting sports clubs that students can also participate in.
USC recognizes several fighting groups and teams on campus, including Wrestling, Jiu-Jitsu, Taekwondo and Boxing. The Mixed Martial Arts club recently joined the recognized lineup as well, earning official recognition from the Recreational Club Council on Nov. 2.
James Kang, a senior majoring in film production, is a coach and co-founder of the MMA club. He described the unique challenges and vigor of fighting sports compared to other athletics.
“Combat sports are interesting in that to compete, it requires a bigger commitment than any other sport,” Kang said. “In basketball or soccer, you’re not gonna get punched in the head if you miss a goal.”
USC also offers martial arts programs that are more regulated and beginner-friendly. Scott Palmer, a Dornsife alumnus and coach of the Jiu-Jitsu team, encourages interested students to attend a practice and learn more about the art of hand-to-hand combat.
“I was under the impression that a Jiu-Jitsu club wouldn’t be allowed at USC when I was a student here,” Palmer said. “But I think there’s now an understanding and awareness of the value of [combat sports].”
Palmer also attested to the sport building defensive skills, confidence and improving fitness for any student willing to step in the ring.
“Coaching for us is about bringing people into Jiu-Jitsu for the first time. The majority of our students come in without knowing what Jiu-Jitsu is,” Palmer said. “They come in for self-defense, if they want to do a martial art or they’re looking for something that’s health and fitness-focused.”
Fighting clubs welcome a variety of members of different skill levels and interests. As USC continues to open up towards combat sports, Palmer encourages anyone who’s curious to try their hand at martial arts.
“Most of the clubs here are very welcoming to new members. It’s something you can scout out, see if it’s for you and ask questions,” Palmer said. “This is an opportunity for people to go and try something out and see if it’s for them without much risk in terms of time or commitment.”

Effective Jan. 1, Charles F. Zukoski will resign as Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, according to a community message emailed Nov. 22 from President Carol L. Folt.
“I want to thank Provost Zukoski for his dedication and service to USC, our faculty, staff, students, and communities,” Folt wrote. “This is an exciting time of growth and innovation at USC, and we will seek to identify a dynamic and strategic leader to continue building on the programs and legacy created by Provost Zukoski.”
Unlike other community messages from Folt, the announcement of the Provost’s resignation was not sent to students. The Daily Trojan was able to confirm that faculty and staff, however, did receive an email with the announcement attached. The University declined multiple requests for comment on the matter, and Zukoski was not made available for an interview.
Prior to his USC provostship, Zukoski served as provost and vice president of student affairs at the University at Buffalo, and prior to that as the vice chancellor for research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
Folt appointed Zukoski as provost in 2019 to succeed Michael Quick, with Folt telling the Daily Trojan that he was the “right person for the right time at this institution.” The Board of Trustees had appointed him as a unanimous first choice among more than 300 other applicants, she said.
The coronavirus pandemic predominated Zukoski’s time in office. In her Nov. 22 message, Folt lauded Zukoski as having “played a pivotal role in the University’s response,” coordinating an immediate shutdown of University campuses in March 2020 and launching an initiative to return to in-person instruction the following year. 
The return to campus was repeatedly delayed until January 2022, citing high positivity rates as cause for concern. In the meantime, Zukoski worked to prioritize students’ mental well-being, including by adding wellness days throughout Spring 2021 in lieu of a spring break and expanding mental health resources.
Zukoski also oversaw the University’s response to a slew of controversies under his leadership. After multiple druggings and sexual assaults were reported at the Sigma Nu fraternity, he created the Working Group on Interfraternity Council Culture, Prevention, and Accountability. 
Following anti-Zionist and antisemitic tweets from a student which caused uproar and culminated in a faculty open letter, Zukoski responded by saying the University “will continue to support programs, groups, and actions that will help us address it.” 
Most recently, Rossier withdrew from the U.S. News & World Report’s annual graduate school rankings, following reports that the school had submitted inaccurate data to falsely raise its scores. In his announcement of the decision, Zukoski assured the Rossier community that the school takes the responsibility to adhere to the specific reporting requirements of the ranking organization “very seriously”, and included a statement from Rossier Dean Pedro Noguera saying he supports “the University’s decision to conduct an independent investigation.”
Zukoski will take a leave of absence before returning to a position as a professor of chemical engineering and materials science in the Viterbi School of Engineering. Executive Vice Provost Elizabeth Graddy will serve as interim provost while the University searches for his replacement, Folt’s statement read. Graddy had also served as interim provost before Zukoski was appointed in 2019.
