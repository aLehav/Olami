My inspiration for this piece not-so-ironically comes from my recent obsession with XG. If you’re unaware, the group consists of seven girls who are all Japanese. However, in a hilarious series of contradictions, the group is based in South Korea, and they only sing in English. Their recent releases like “GALZ XYPHER” consist of Japanese, Korean and English, but all of their titled singles are solely composed of the latter. 
The following list that I have compiled only consists of artists that are strictly labeled as K-pop — no Japanese-pop artists are allowed. Similarly, Japanese versions of originally Korean songs will also not be counted. All of the songs that make my list were written in Japanese and are not remakes. 
5. “Voltage” by ITZY 
Ironically, ITZY almost seems to be making up for their subpar performances in their native language by producing Japanese masterpieces. 
ITZY is one of the rare K-pop phenomena that doesn’t have any foreign idols in its group. Although their first couple years after debut were a firestorm of success — ITZY has more music show wins than any other Fourth Generation group — they have fallen off. I’m sorry, but there’s no sugar coating it.
As their fanbase seemingly dwindled after the release of “SNEAKERS” in July 2022 and “Boys Like You” the following October, one of the only saving graces for MIDZYs, ITZY’s fandom name, was their Japanese tracks, like Voltage, that were luckily released that same year. 
4. “Everlasting Shine” by TXT
TXT, formally known as Tomorrow X Together, is one of the many groups that doesn’t seem to produce Japanese tracks equivalent to their Korean songs. This is a lot coming from someone who ults this HYBE Entertainment superstorm. 
I wouldn’t be upset at the lack of foreign releases if the group wasn’t already notorious for producing music with extreme sparsity. Being a MOA — TXT’s fandom name — can be extremely difficult with regularly scheduled musical dry seasons forcing us to wait long months just for an album drop. 
Everlasting Shine is the only TXT Japanese track that stands out to me, and for good reason. The vocals are outstanding, and the lyrics are undeniably comforting. Who doesn’t want to “shine like a diamond?”
3. “Your Eyes Tell” and “Stay Gold” by BTS
Now we’re entering absolutely exceptional territory. The previously listed songs are good, but I would never choose them over the group’s Korean tracks. These two masterpieces, however, are immaculate additions to BTS’ discography, regardless of language. 
“Your Eyes Tell” is probably the song you hear when you enter heaven. It is the epitome of perfect voice blending, harmony and individuality shining through on a track. With voices like Jimin’s (지민) and Jungkook’s (정국) being put on full blast, it’s impossible not to fall in love. It’s tear-jerking and empowering at the same time. 
“Stay Gold” is the same way in terms of composition, just with fewer wistful undertones. This is what I like to call a “happy-sad” piece, and the cinematography for the music video is so nostalgic, especially since BTS’ hiatus. Jimin’s voice especially shines here as well, but I may be a little biased, as he’s my favorite member.
2. “Blah Blah Blah” by ITZY
It’s no surprise that ITZY made this list twice — the same reasoning follows the props I gave for ‘Voltage.” It’s like they’re making up for their unsuccessful Korean comebacks by acing the Japanese realm.
Honestly the top two spots are a toss-up. “Blah Blah Blah” might be in my top three favorite ITZY songs of all time in general — the track just happens to be in Japanese. The music video for the track is mesmerizing, like many ITZY music videos, and the choreography is so well-executed that it’s impossible to not stare in awe. 
In my opinion, Ryujin’s (류진) girlboss style is the one that reigns supreme in this musical concept, but Yeji’s (예지) is close behind. This song bleeds power, and the message is unmistakably ITZY.
I will admit that my ranking system is a bit skewed by the amount of ties, but it seemed silly to separate the groups on this list when their songs are on similar echelons.
TWICE’s Japanese successes may be because of the fact that a full third of the group is, in fact, Japanese. Everyone knows that their Korean tracks are undeniable trend setters in the K-pop realm, but their Japanese tracks are, in my mind, borderline unbeatable. 
The time and energy that they put into their Japanese popularity really pays off time and time again. According to Koreaboo, a popular K-pop press-site, “With their Japanese album sales alone, TWICE has already sold more albums in Japan than every other Korean girl group has sold total albums since TWICE’s debut in 2015,” and for good reason.
TWICE has a plethora of Japanese releases, but the two that absolutely stand out the most are “Breakthrough” and “Perfect World.” These songs are what addiction sounds like. I’ve been listening to both on repeat since they each were released (“Breakthrough” in June 2019 and “Perfect World” in June 2021), and by some miracle, I’m not sick of either.
Our queen Jihyo (지효), TWICE’s leader, undeniably owns “Perfect World,” and the lyrics, along with the music video, let each member shine in a beautiful way that centers around a mock militaristic stage performance that takes a jab at men. The group really reigns in their girlboss motif here, with English lyrics reading “I don’t need your love” and “Don’t make me hate you more.”
In “Breakthrough,” Jihyo slays again, this time accompanied by memorable rap performances by Dahyun (다현) and Chaeyoung (채영). The music video is once again electrifying, with the opening scene focusing on a split color scheme of pink and purple. The choreography is addicting, as are the beat, rhythm and lyrics.
TWICE are the undeniable gold medalists of Japanese releases. There is no room for argument. 
I would like to acknowledge the fact that this list isn’t very diverse. However, there aren’t many groups that release Japanese originals very often. Some superstars of K-pop, like BLACKPINK and NCT, just don’t have enough sustainable foreign pieces, or any at all. 
Regardless, I encourage you to expand your K-pop ear to these wonderful songs released by your favorites. Most likely, language barriers don’t affect your musical taste, so inviting these pieces to your playlist shouldn’t be a problem.

Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang visited USC Monday to connect with students in a talk hosted by USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, the Center for the Political Future and Trojan Democrats. The event drew crowds of students to the Price School of Public Policy to hear Yang explain his personal journey into politics and his vision for a renewed, less polarized American election system. 
Yang’s entrance into American politics was unconventional: After spending time touring the country to recruit startups for his nonprofit, Venture for America, he said he became aware of the increasingly dangerous technological and economic divides threatening American citizens. 
“I had tons of friends in technology who would say to me over drinks in private, ‘Oh, yeah, we’re gonna get rid of millions of jobs,’” Yang said. 
Learning that the technology seen as the future of the American economy would destroy the lives of millions left Yang jarred and searching for solutions. That pursuit eventually led him to settle on his flagship policy, Universal Basic Income. UBI would provide $1,000 per month to every American over the age of 18, helping to support those laid off because of technological advancement as well as alleviate nationwide poverty and balance the expanding wealth gap. 
“I’m gonna be the magical Asian man from the future,” Yang said, jokingly, about his ideas. 
The campaign’s overall mission was to “accelerate the alleviation of mass poverty in the U.S.”
“That was the goal,” he said, “to become the anti-poverty candidate.”
However, Yang’s defeat in the 2020 primary election left him feeling helpless. American politics were becoming more polarized, hate was spreading in the media and online, and the coronavirus pandemic was exacerbating already deep divides in the American public, he said.
“I started digging into why I felt like our politics were descending into madness,” said Yang of his post-defeat activity. “And I figured out that it’s by design.” 
The current approval rating for Congress is 18%, yet the reelection rate for incumbent Congress members regularly tops well over 90%. Yang blames this disconnect on two major barriers to better elections in the United States: gerrymandering and biased primary elections. 
“So, constitutional amendments to get rid of gerrymandering. That’s a great solution,” Yang said. What’s the problem? What does it take to get a constitutional amendment? Three quarters of the states.”
Instead of tackling gerrymandering, Yang turned his attention to primary elections. Primary elections allow candidates to become frontrunners for their party by appealing to the most extreme 10% of their constituents, Yang told the audience, alienating the typical voter and forcing them to vote for extreme policies. 
“Imagine you’re a member of Congress. If you want to keep your job, all you have to do is keep the 10 to 12% most extreme ideological people off your back,” Yang said. “So, if you were a very reasonable Republican, you get [elected], all of a sudden, you’re like, ‘Whoa, if I’m going to keep my job, I have to play ball with [extreme right-wing voters].’”
Yang’s argument for abolishing primaries in order to reduce political extremism was just demonstrated in Alaska’s midterm election. Alaskan voters abolished their primary vote in 2020, and as a result, extremist former governor Sarah Palin was defeated by the relatively unknown Mary Peltola, who campaigned on Alaska-centered issues such as fisheries and the environment. 
“Sarah Palin lost in very large part because there was no primary in Alaska,” Yang said. “Anyone can vote for anyone, and so all of a sudden, instead of just having to answer to the 10 to 12% [of voters] on either extreme, you have to try and get 51% of the greater whole.” 
Yang said he was relieved that his theory of abolishing primaries to reduce extremism was proved correct and that former governor Palin was not elected to Congress.
“Imagine if Sarah Palin were a member of Congress, [the media would] be like, ‘Oh, good, another crazy person we can stick the microphone in front of! Lauren Boebert’s not available? Where’s Sarah?’” he joked to roars of laughter from the audience. 
Yang sees this success story as a blueprint for the future of American democracy and has made it the mission of the political party he founded, the Forward Party. Maine and Nevada have already followed suit, and Yang is focused on continuing the movement.
“We’re going to try and take a shot at [overturning primaries in] another four or five states in 2024,” Yang said. “Turns out that 25 states have the same ballot initiative measure, where if you get 50.1% of the people in that state to vote to get rid of the party primaries, they can do it.”
The excitement among students for Yang’s mission was palpable, with students running to the stage to ask questions and take pictures with the former presidential candidate following his speech. 
“I really enjoyed the fact that [Yang’s talk] was about political structure, not political policy,” said Cameron Nelson, a senior majoring in political science and economics. “We talk so much about policy change, and we have ideals about our government that we want to see fulfilled, but so many of them aren’t possible until the actual structure of the government changes.”
Bella Sanchez, a junior majoring in international relations, said she viewed Yang’s visit to campus as eye opening and an opportunity to become more politically engaged. 
“One thing that I have struggled [with] in the past is I don’t think I’ve been really connected to politics. I don’t think I’ve been well educated,” Sanchez said. “Going to things like this is really important to opening up the conversation to the younger generation and making sure we can make actual change in our government and in our political system.”
Nicholas Wong, a junior majoring in neuroscience, was similarly complementary toward the experience and thankful to the University for the opportunity to hear from such a prominent member of the political community.
“Having somebody like Andrew Yang come in, you can really hear somebody with really innovative ideas and it kind of just rounds out the USC experience,” Wong said. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Yang encouraged students to find and support causes that they’re passionate about without being afraid to branch out into the greater Los Angeles community as well.
“On campus, if organizations or leaders are trying to think positive — help them out,” Yang said. “Everyone needs someone who cares and will spread the word [about their cause]. And that’s true beyond campus too. If you want to get involved with local candidates, they would love to have you.”

On Feb. 3, a freight train derailed near East Palestine, Ohio which included 50 cars carrying very toxic chemicals leading to a large fire. While public officials conducted an evacuation of the area and assured residents that it was safe for them to return to East Palestine, it was nothing more than a fallacy. 
If the toxic chemicals weren’t enough to worry about, now toxic politics are entering the scene. 
Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb announced on Twitter March 8 that testing of the crash site showed that “the material tested does not contain any harmful levels of dioxins,” a chemical known to cause cancer. However, experts from the United States Environmental Protection Agency found that soil samples show a much wider scale of contamination. Linda Birnbaum, a former head of the U.S. National Toxicology Program and EPA scientist shared with The Guardian that levels were “up to 14 times higher than dioxin soil limits in some states.” 
Residents of East Palestine are concerned about their safety and the long-term effects these chemicals can have on their health. Their concerns for their health are not just pressing now, but even more so in the long term. The toxic chemicals have killed around 55,000 minnows and other wildlife. Children are sick and breaking out in rashes with doctors in the area stating that they are not qualified to tell patients whether their symptoms are chemical poisoning or just the flu. 
This incident is an example of where the people must be put first. Instead, news sources are focusing on the fact that President Joe Biden hasn’t yet made an appearance in Ohio after the incident. Currently, President Biden is visiting Ukraine to show his solidarity with the country. This has sparked a lot of Republicans to make remarks about Biden being able to show support for a foreign country but failing to show up for the people of his own. This includes harsh criticism from Donald Trump who visited East Palestine Feb. 3. However, Democrats have rebounded this criticism by pointing out the fact that Trump railed back on safety regulations for railroads that prevent disasters like these. This back and forth between both sides is disregarding what should be the priority: the people of East Palestine.
Congress may publically scrutinize the Norfolk Southern CEO at the congressional hearing for not doing enough to help the victims, but none of it matters if it is just for show. Politicians may be giving Oscar-worthy performances of caring about the victims, but it does not mean anything if their needs are not being met. While a former U.S. president throws insults and a current one refuses to take action, the residents of East Palestine remain in the limbo of uncertain futures. 
The incident in East Palestine is far from an isolated occurrence. It’s a difficult pill to swallow, but disasters very similar to this one have happened before and will continue to as government officials prioritize their political agendas over the citizens they promise to help. Residents who do not have the resources to leave town have to face the consequences of politicians’ negligence and watch the politicians they elected play a game of political warfare while they suffer. 
Just as chemicals pollute the air, politicians are polluting the goodwill of this country. The issue begins the moment an incident like this is made partisan. No matter your side, it should be undeniable the people of East Palestine need help. 
Talk means nothing if it is not followed up by action. When disaster strikes we have two options: let it further fracture us or let it unite us towards a common goal. In this case, that is ensuring the people of East Palestine are given the support they need.

In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests that swept the globe in the summer of 2020, the governing body of ten of USC’s sororities, the Panhellenic Council, made a promise to its members “to take unified and direct action in beginning their DEI efforts … to create long-lasting change.”
Despite this Community Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Plan, over two years later, USC’s Panhellenic sororities still seem to be breeding grounds for racial discrimination.
A few current and former members of Panhellenic, whose names have been changed due to privacy concerns, spoke to the Daily Trojan about their experiences. 
Isabel, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said that while she has seen her sorority do more DEI work recently, she did not see other houses doing the same.
“It’s unfortunate that [my house’s DEI chairs] are taking it on all [by] themselves and other houses are not doing the same because they’re not pressured or required by Panhellenic,” Isabel said.
And yet, according to Panhellenic’s DEI plan, the other houses should be doing that same work. Instead of enforcing their plan, Panhellenic seems to be allowing lapses in progress.
This absence of progress could be because of Panhellenic’s lack of commitment toward their DEI initiative: The council’s website, which includes an Accountability Tracker, says that it was last updated on “Tuesday, December 1st and will be updated monthly.” What year this “December 1st” occurred is not listed. The data on the Accountability Tracker does not include any date more recent than April 4, 2022, which is to say that the site is clearly not being updated monthly.
Alyssa, a sophomore majoring in international relations and global business who identifies as a Black woman, said that there is an unspoken desire for whiteness within Panhellenic, something that is especially evident in its recruitment practices.
“A lot of times those white Newport girls are the priorities,” Alyssa said. “They’re the girls that you see everyone kind of trying to go after during the rush process. Every house kind of wants them.”
During the rush process, Isabel said that members of color are frequently paired with potential members of the same racial or ethnic community despite lacking any other similarities. This practice not only reduces these people to their racial identity but serves to present a certain image of diversity that doesn’t necessarily exist.
Bella, a junior majoring in political science on the pre-law track who identifies as African American, said that she was offered a bid via Instagram by the president of her sorority who was a fellow person of color, causing her to believe that her house was one of the more diverse houses and to feel more comfortable joining.
In reality, Bella said that the lack of other Black women in her sorority led to an interaction in which someone called her by the name of the only other “dark skinned Black member” in her house.
Alyssa had a similar experience, which happened after she took a photo with a girl in her sorority one night. 
“A couple weeks later [the girl] sent the picture to my friend, who also happens to be Black, and she was like, ‘We had so much fun that night!’ and then my friend was like, ‘That’s not me,’” Alyssa said.
Isabel, who is half white and half Puerto Rican, identifies as Latina but said she acknowledges that she is white passing and believes that has had an impact on her fitting in with Greek life.
“I know for a fact that they treat me one way but as soon as it would be Hispanic Heritage Month they’d look through the roster and call on me to make a statement,” Isabel said.
Victoria, a junior majoring in business administration who identifies as an Asian woman, said that this representation was a barrier to her joining Greek life.
“I remember when I was thinking of possibly rushing, I was looking at all the accounts and their new [pledge classes] and trying to count how many diverse or people of color there were,” she said.
Alyssa and Bella expressed that they did not regret their decisions to join sororities because they’ve ended up making many friends there. For Victoria, the friends she made were not enough to keep her involved.
“It just seemed so insanely superficial,” she said. “I feel like being a part of it went against my morals … Especially after the sexual assault[s at Sigma Nu], I cannot stand for a sorority that continues to be a part of these events, go out, complain in the group chat about frats being shut down — like how can I stand here and be a part of this? It just goes against everything I believe in.”
For those who feel like Victoria, maybe nothing can be done to be convinced to join Panhellenic. But for others, there needs to be more than just mandatory presentations, which, Bella said, cause members to “associate the boring events with DEI.”
Panhellenic’s sororities must actively enforce their DEI initiatives and recruit people of color because of who they are and the value they add to these jaded institutions, not just as tokens of progress.

Welcome back to school, Trojans! I just had a fantastic time in Spain thrifting and eating my heart out, but I will admit that I’ve missed you all. 
Upon checking the emails I’ve missed at my boarding gate, I realized I hadn’t yet responded to a message from my friend looking for help on her thesis. Asking me to discuss the role of mental health in fashion, I initially wondered what I could offer. There is the age-old — and still relevant — discussion of the fashion industry and eating disorders or the hardship of getting your foot in the door in such an exclusive industry. But after some mindless scrolling through my camera roll on the plane and seeing all the different mirror selfies I took for my parents’ approval on a shirt or a dress, I realized that fashion plays a much larger component in mental health than we give it credit for. 
Of course, there are the psychological understandings of concepts such as shopping as an emotional response to hardships, stress or difficulty in life (i.e. retail therapy), as well as the idea of buyer’s remorse — negative emotions and guilt after purchasing items on impulse — especially when the item is out of a reasonable budget or price point. 
There are also mentally taxing days where maybe I woke up on the wrong side of the bed: I’m breaking out, my hair isn’t falling quite right and I feel bloated from yesterday’s dinner. When trying on different clothes and seeing that they don’t fit the way they usually do or the way they look in my mind, my day immediately turns from bad to worse as I feel — unfortunately — ugly and undesirable, even to myself. 
Still, just as clothes can break you down, they can lift you up. Nothing feels more satisfying than the little victories of shopping when you find that one item you’ve been searching for months for or when you grab the last item in your size. And, when you find a piece that hugs and accentuates every part that you love about yourself, you feel like the most radiant person on Earth, internally and externally. 
However, I realize that this is just my personal experience. I have given clothes, fashion and shopping an ability to affect myself because I am heavily materialistic. While I used to be 
ashamed of this, as I learned and appreciated fashion more, I understood that this materialism stems partly from my fear of loss. What a sudden turn, I know, but bear with me.
I am extremely fond of clothes particularly because of the role fashion has played in my life, how it’s represented different stages of it and my continuously growing love for the industry. I take this same approach to other goods too, like photos and books; I want to remember not just what the item was, but also what I was feeling at the time, what I was experiencing, who I was with. 
But beyond this emotional role I have given to clothes, as I understand that for many, clothes are just garments and fabric, constructed into body-covering shapes, why do I allow fashion and shopping to have such an immense impact on me and my psyche? I am fully aware of the transactional relationship between brands and myself, and that while the brand relies on customer loyalty, it still feels like I’m giving (just) a little more. 
It’s odd because if someone described this up-and-down relationship to me using people, I would question the health of that relationship. So, then, what even is the point of shopping past utilitarian purpose? Is it just the privilege to be able to say you own a piece from the brand? Or is it to introduce additional variables into the equation of daily decision-making options? Or is it because humans feel the desire to legitimize their existence through having an abundance of material goods to say, “Look! I own this! I am real! I am a person on Earth that exists and has memories and friends and a purpose!” 
I believe it is a concoction of all and none at the same time. Instead, they balance each other out into a net zero, with a fluctuating plus-minus factor of one. If clothes are able to give and get so much from us, the relationship becomes balanced as we get rid of pieces we hate and fawn over pieces we love. On those days where clothes are our enemy, the relationship falls heavier on the negative spectrum, resulting in -1, while the opposite results in a +1 sum of the day. But when charting this over time, I believe we all end up at a zero sum average. 
What makes this separate from just another thing that humans must endure in life is exactly that — the human element. Humans, while capable of being evil and cruel, can also be full of optimism, creativity, abundance and love. Humans have an incredible ability to give purpose to things on a grand, world-wide scale and in their personal lives. If you think about it, it’s spectacular: Just as every story has three sides — A, B and the objective truth — every shoe, pasta dish and bouquet of flowers can have infinite interpretations. 
Ultimately, I believe it boils down to a quote from one of my favorite book-turned-movies, “He’s Just Not That Into You” (2009): “I may dissect each little thing and put myself out there so much but at least that means that I still care.” 
To care is such a wonderful thing, and I’d rather go about my life caring, appreciating and celebrating than to objectively view things as they are. After all, we only die once — why not make the most of life?

If you are a coffee connoisseur who finds joy in sipping on an early morning espresso or cooling down with an iced vanilla latte, you’ve probably grown tired of the limited on-campus options. There is no better way to start your day than with a dose of caffeine. The necessity of coffee is especially important during the relentless workload of midterm season. If you are enamored by the smell of freshly brewed coffee but want a break from the repetitive Starbucks run and long wait of mobile orders, here is a list of five coffee shops in South Central to try: 
Coffee Del Mundo
Located on Vermont Avenue less than five miles from campus is Coffee Del Mundo, the “world’s first non-European coffee establishment.” Visiting Coffee Del Mundo means taking a trip across the globe. The carefully selected coffee beans originate from five countries: El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Mexico. Coinciding with this theme of coffee from around the world, each cold brew bottle or bag of beans is labeled with a mock plane ticket from LAX to the origin of the coffee. Coffee Del Mundo thrives on the appreciation of the coffee’s cultural origins. The walls are lined with coffee bean bags and various countries’ flags. 
Coffee Del Mundo is also 100% plant based. The coffee shop hosts “Plant Based Saturdays,” an event that brings local chefs in to share recipes.
If you are ready to explore the world of coffee, bus line 754 will bring you right to the door.
Café Calle
Beginning as a street vendor selling only pour over coffee to South Central, Diana Martinez created Café Calle. Evolving into a catering business for pop-up events, Café Calle finally opened a brick-and-mortar store in March 2020. 
Located at 3310 S. Central Ave, Café Calle operates under the slogan #PourCoffeeNotHate. Martinez is the daughter of Salvadoran immigrants and proudly sells coffee from El Salvador and Guatemala. Customers are drawn to the decadent drinks flavored with homemade syrups and fresh acai bowls. Café Calle is growing to have an integral impact on the South Central community. Through events such as community bike rides and coffee crawls, the shop puts an emphasis on highlighting neighboring small businesses.
To reach Café Calle, take bus lines 38 and 55.  
Harun Coffee
With plenty of outdoor seats to soak up the Los Angeles sun, Harun Coffee is a perfect study spot. 
If you aren’t feeling coffee, Harun offers a wide variety of smoothies — some including espresso so you can still have a caffeine kick. 
If you find yourself hungry between assignments, the Rasta Pasta and Halal Burger are sure to satisfy any cravings. 
Hop on the Metro E Line and transfer to the Metro K Line to reach Harun Coffee. With an art gallery within the coffee shop co-owner, Chase Johnson created a space which breeds creativity. It is also not unusual to find musical performances or pop-up events within the cafe. An artistically driven and revolutionary coffee shop environment is one of a kind. 
Hot and Cool Cafe
Located in Leimert Park, Hot and Cool Cafe serves ethically-sourced Ethiopian coffee. If you are looking for more than just a drink, the cafe has a strong menu — mostly vegan and plant based. Some highlights include their breakfast burrito, cauliflower wings and soul bowl. 
The cozy spot was built to provide space for artists. Between poetry readings, open mic nights and live music shows, Hot and Cool Cafe has no shortage of entertaining and enriching events. It is not only a great spot to grind out some midterms, but it is also a welcoming and inspiring space for artists to work on their craft.   
Unfortunately, the 4331 Degnan Blvd location was damaged during recent L.A. storms and is  under construction. Once it is able to reopen, bus line 38 and the Metro K Line will bring you to the spot of your next coffee obsession. 
South LA Cafe
Also in Leimert Park, this brightly lit, roomy space is the perfect spot to study, chat with friends or just decompress with a nice cup of coffee. Between horchata lattes and lavender lattes, South LA Cafe provides any drink you could want. Coffee beans are also available for purchase to bring a little piece of South LA Cafe in your home. 
The cafe also birthed the South LA Community Foundation which is dedicated to uplifting Black and brown communities. The foundation works to address food insecurity and teach business skills in the hopes of seeing more business owners of color. 
Take the Metro E line to reach the home of $5 avocado toast. And, if you’re having a lazy day and don’t want to take a trek, the cafe recently became a food provider at the Natural History Museum just across the street from campus.

The last time Chappell Roan performed at the Fonda Theatre she opened for Vance Joy as part of his “Lay It On Me” tour — but that was six years ago, and Roan has since come into her own. As the final stop on her completely sold-out tour, the Los Angeles-based artist threw a killer kiki this past Wednesday.
The show, aptly named the “Naked in North America” tour, was a pink-and-silver rodeo experience curated for queer audiences. Before the theater opened its doors, a long line of costumed crowd members wrapped around the block; Roan decreed the tour be a themed affair through a couplet of Instagram posts that listed themes of each stop, and tour attendees whole-heartedly participated. The theme for L.A., “So you wanna be a popstar,” was also reflected in each of Roan’s all-femme band members, with costumes drawn from Lana Del Rey, Avril Lavigne and David Bowie. The venue was full of femme people dressed in what could only be described as a Republican lawmaker’s worst nightmare — or greatest fantasy.
The night started with dazzling performances from three local drag queens: Missile Aneous, Aiana Shaw and La Kelly Ru. With sensational stunts, lush lip syncing and power-house performances from the queens, it wasn’t surprising to see the electric engagement of the crowd. 
By the time the local drag artists finished their opening sets, the audience had transformed into one deafening, queer mass — the perfect energy to roll out the figurative Studio 54 carpet for the headliner.
Flashing lights and soundbites from Roan’s “Naked in Manhattan” marked the beginning of L.A.’s most sapphic event of the night. Roan ran on stage to thundering applause from the theater and opened the show in a blindingly blonde wig. After the epithetical first song, Roan followed with her 2020 single “Love Me Anyway” before disappearing off the side of the stage. 
Audience members were bewildered by her sudden exit — until clips from Disney’s “Hannah Montana” began to play over the speakers. As the audio grew louder, Roan appeared again, sans blonde wig. Members of the front row screamed at Roan’s new costume: Miley Stewart. 
Roan’s strengths reach far beyond her visual artistry — this tour, she took on the role as her own stylist, makeup artist and costume designer — the artist’s yonic yodeling was a soul-shaking talent that did not spare the live audience. 
Roan travels in a mere van and U-Haul trailer, which makes her activism seem so much more sacrificial. On top of donating a portion of every ticket sale to the Black, trans-led collective For The Gworls, she spoke in gratitude for her tour openers. 
“This is the 20th show and the final show of the tour and in every city, we’ve sourced three local drag performers from that city,” Roan said. “When you tip your drag queens — if you didn’t get a chance, we’ve got a tip jar at the merch table — you are directly supporting your local drag community. It’s very important right now, and it always has been.”
Apart from performing yet-unreleased tracks, Roan’s highlight of the night was her performance of “Bitter,” which she noted was from an older era of being a depressed Midwest girl, one she doesn’t identify with anymore. 
“You have to honor your younger self, even if you do not like them,” she told the crowd.
Despite having moved into a happier, celebratory period of her artistry, Roan sang with a convincing Appalachian angst as she recounted her journey with self-sabotage. Audience members were transfixed on Roan, immersed in the bitter, balladeering belladonna’s tragic tale.
Taking a sharp left turn, Roan quickly raised the energy in the venue with a stunning cover of Alanis Morissette’s “You Oughta Know,” which was a perfect fit for her lower register. The sapphic songbird had timeless appeal, even when launching into a choreographed dance to her unreleased queer take on a “YMCA”-esque dance track, “Hot To Go.” 
When it came time for Roan’s encore, she performed the song every single concertgoer had been waiting to hear. “Pink Pony Club” — produced by Daniel Nigro, the collaborator behind Olivia Rodrigo’s “Sour” and Caroline Polachek’s “Pang” — explores Roan’s journey of finding her queer community in West Hollywood and has been an anthem of reclamation for many LGBTQIA+ people in the past years. The crowd sang as if it weren’t a school night and danced as if they had nothing to lose. Roan accidentally threw her mic off the stage. It was the perfect song to end an extremely successful tour on.
“She gives it her all,” said Mado Dolce, a long-time fan and concert attendee. “She really cares about her fans.”
With Roan’s trajectory, it’ll be exciting to see where Roan will go next. Whether the project that Roan has been hinting at would be a Lana Del Rey-esque Americana pop album — “Chemtrails Over the Drag Club,” perhaps — or a cult-classic pop record, there is much anticipation. As the country gal Roan claims to be, she sure seems to have the range. Join the “Pink Pony Club” while you still can: Chappell Roan is the next big thing.

As I sat in T-Mobile Arena watching USC’s opening game in the Pac-12 tournament against Arizona State, I couldn’t help but feel disappointed. I knew that the Trojans were nowhere near the likes of Arizona and UCLA in the Pac-12, but to lose to a team that you had beaten just five days earlier and not even really put up a fight in the game was very telling. 
It ended in a 5-point loss, but if you watched the game you saw that it was never really close. USC never looked like they wanted to win the game and were down by double-digits throughout.
And then on Friday, I watched a similar script unfold in their opening round game against Michigan State, and just like that their season was over. This was a season for men’s basketball that was filled with ups and downs. From an opening day double-digit loss to mid-major Florida Gulf Coast to getting a decisive statement home win against top-ranked UCLA, this season for the Trojans had it all. But while it ended with more negatives than positives, the only thing on my mind is next year and how I can’t wait for it to begin.
Obviously, the second a team you care about has their season ended you immediately want to look to next year and gain any ounce of renewed hope. But this time it’s going to be different for USC men’s basketball. This time there’s a reason to get excited. There’s a reason to raise expectations. There’s a reason to start counting down the days until the 2023-24 college basketball season is underway. 
Now I’m not going to make some bold prediction here stating that USC will go on and win the next three straight NCAA championships. As shown in previous editions of this column, some of my predictions have certainly aged like milk.
Of course, as soon as I state that USC women’s basketball is the real deal and will make a big run, they proceed to lose in the first round of both their conference tournament and the NCAA tournament. But then again, I am also currently in first place in The Daily Trojan bracket challenge and in the 99.6 percentile of all brackets. 
When it comes to making predictions, I tend to have a mixed bag. So instead of making that crazy prediction, I’m just going to present you with some facts, and then you can decide for yourself how high to make your expectations for the team.
It would be hard to talk about next season for USC men’s basketball without first stating the obvious: USC has the No. 1 recruit in the entire country coming here next year. Isaiah Collier will be a Trojan household name if he isn’t already. The five-star is USC’s first-ever No. 1 recruit in the modern recruiting era and just won national high school player of the year. If you thought Boogie Ellis manning the point for the Trojans was fun to watch, just wait until Collier shows up.
Looking back, five of the last six No. 1 ranked recruits, not including 2020, have all led their teams to the Sweet Sixteen or further in March Madness. And all of them have led them to at least one win in the tournament. These recruits are ranked high and regarded as such for a reason.
And that might not be all for next year’s recruiting class. The No. 33 ranked recruit according to 24/7 sports is still undecided and has narrowed down USC as one of his final three schools. And who is the No. 33 ranked recruit you might ask? Oh, just the son of arguably the greatest professional basketball player of all time. Bronny James could be the X factor for the Trojans next year.
I’ve heard friends refer to him as “a 3-star recruit with a 5-star name,” and in all honesty that could be true. I haven’t seen much of his game except for a few highlights on Instagram. But as they say, the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree, and I’m sure a backcourt tandem of James and Collier would stack up with the best in the country.
But let’s not forget about all the talent USC has on its current roster for next season. The Trojans had nine total underclassmen on the roster this season, and many of them gained valuable experience. USC has a good strong core heading into next season with sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters, freshman forward Tre White, sophomore guard Kobe Johnson and freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu.
This core performed well in their elevated roles this season and was recognized by that in raking in a bunch of Pac-12 awards. Dixon-Waters won Pac-12 sixth player of the year, Johnson was named to the Pac-12 All-Defensive team and White was named to the Pac-12 all-freshman team. And with Iwuchukwu, crossing my fingers, being healthy for a full season, this core can reach heights this program hasn’t seen in a while.
This season may have ended on a sour note and the era of Boogie Ellis and Drew Peterson has drawn to a close, but this was the perfect transition for those next up at USC. Will USC men’s basketball win its first-ever NCAA championship next season? It’s honestly too early to tell. But what I will say is that next year’s team will be different from years past, and will give everyone boasting cardinal and gold something to get excited about.
