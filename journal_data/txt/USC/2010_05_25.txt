The husband and wife convicted in the hit-and-run that killed one USC student and seriously injured another will serve the maximum sentence in state prison, a judge said before a packed courtroom Monday.
Friends and family of Adrianna Bachan, the USC freshman who was killed in a hit-and-run last March, filled the courtroom in Downtown Los Angeles to hear the sentencing of Claudia Cabrera and Josue Luna, whose Infiniti struck Bachan and fellow student Marcus Garfinkle near the intersection of Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard on March 29, 2009.
Cabrera, who was driving the car, was sentenced to eight years in prison. Luna, the car’s passenger, will serve seven years. Authorities say Luna pulled Garfinkle from the hood of the car after the crash and left him on the side of the road, severely injured.
In sentencing the couple, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert J. Perry said, “The actions of the defendants on March 29th of 2009 were outrageous and shocking.”
Perry denied the defense’s request that the two serve shorter terms. He said the couple tried to evade responsibility by lying to police and covering up the crime. He called their actions “extremely callous.”
During Monday’s hearing, Luna and Cabrera said they were sorry for their actions and wanted to apologize to Bachan’s family as well as Garfinkle and his family.
“We are truly sorry for the great pain we caused you,” Luna said, addressing Bachan’s family.
Speaking to Garfinkle, who also spoke at the hearing, Luna said, “I know your life has changed completely. My plan was never to let you die there or toss you.”
Garfinkle said in court Monday that his injuries have made it difficult for him even to walk to class without pain medication. He said he has titanium rods in his legs and is expecting to undergo more surgeries. The Los Angeles Times reports that Garfinkle’s family is currently fighting the health insurance company over about $200,000 worth of medical bills.
“My life is forever changed and there’s nothing I can do about it,” Garfinkle said. “I am helpless.”
Like Luna, Cabrera also expressed remorse, saying that although the crash was an accident, she was ashamed of herself for not taking responsibility and for lying to the police.
The prosecution alleged that Cabrera, when questioned, tried to blame her husband and did not admit responsibility. Additionally, the prosecution said the pair tried to cover up the crime by having the car’s windshield fixed before towing the vehicle to Mexico.
“My actions that night do not reflect the person that I am,” she said. “I am not a monster … I hope that all of you can find it in your hearts to forgive me and my husband.”
But Carmen Bachan, Adrianna’s mother, told reporters she is serving a “life sentence.”
“I will never, ever, ever forgive them,” Bachan said. “I don’t have that capacity in me, I’m sorry to say.”
Cabrera was arrested April 2 based on a tip police received following the announcement of a large monetary reward for information leading to a conviction. Luna was arrested April 18 as he was crossing into the United States from Mexico. In March, both pleaded no contest to leaving the scene of an accident. Cabrera also pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter.
To USC “Alumni”-
Nice try pulling the race card.
Our Parents + Grandparents filled out all the necessary  papers & CAME HERE LEGALLY .
Many of them had to wait several years.
Keep YOUR illegal racial crap to yourself. 
And why wouldn’t these fleeing mexicans stay put & try to improve their homeland ?
Can’t they make their country better by staying there & working things out?
Why do they have to suck the life out of our country because they’re too lazy to improve their own???
Admit it “alumnus”…. Brown or White…they’re nothing but TRAITORS.
To uh:
Don’t start racial crap here. Before thinking about throwing all the mexicans out of the country, ask your great grand parents where have they come from 100 years ago.
“I know your life has changed completely. My plan was never to let you die there or toss you.” Sounds like one of those touching moments in a movie. The justice system is a joke! Lily Burke’s killer dodges capital punishment after her throat was slashed and head beaten to death. 
Bleeding heart libs: “you don’t know what these people (perpetrators of egregious, violent crimes) went through. Don’t you know that they got the short end of the stick, thus it shaped their detrimental paths in life? What they did wasn’t something evil, but no, rather a flaw in society.” 
Capital punishment needs to be implemented more frequently, especially for those whose crimes are unspeakable.
7-8 years?
What would the sentence have been
if they were WHITE?
Parent: Neither of them were illegal immigrants. Don’t jump to conclusions and make immature statements about their backround…
I do agree that 7/8 years in prison is way too soft and easy, especially when they were trying to hard to cover up their heinous crimes. Although I do not believe that they deserve life, death, or as torture (-____-) they should have at least gotten 20 years. But in the end, I am just glad they were caught and punished for their actions.
First of all these people were not ilegals. What difference does it make what race they are? What, if they had been white, everything they did would’ve been ok? And that is exactly who she is; a monster, an animal she does not feel guilt for what she has done in her sick little  mind she is the victim. Good luck when this one gets out.
Oh right, parent…we should get rid of all of the Mexicans in this country regardless of whether they’re legal or not….
Should have thrown them both in the electric bleachers and thrown the switch!  If they did that t my daughter I would have shot both of them in cold blood!  The law  is way to liberal.  I feel l like Arizona may be on to something.
I think you should torture them first too. Oh wait, thats just barbaric and would never give you your child back. Hmmm…maybe it takes maturity to realize that revenge is often meaningless?
Well, when your loved one is hit by a car going 60 mph+ like a bowling pin, and you watch her body become grossly disfigured, she’s in a coma, and she’s barely breathing on a life support machine, then you tell me how “revenge doesn’t solve anything.” Do you know about Lily Burke? When your 17 year old daughter’s throat is slashed mulitple times, and her head beaten to the point where the white of her skull becomes exposed, then you explain to me how “revenge doesn’t solve anything.” 
How about I get a baseball bat and take homerun swings at your head until your skull cracks open and your pieces of your brain start falling out? I’ll demonstrate my “contrition” in front of your loved ones, and I hope they forgive me. That’s how you see it right?
7/8 yrs ?  That is outrageous!  Something is terribly wrong here-they deserve lifetime sentences.

A little more than a week ago, a slab of rock that will someday make the cornerstone of USC’s new Our Savior Parish made its way through St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City on a forklift.

The cornerstone was blessed by Pope Benedict XVI in a brief ceremony attended by USC trustees, alumni and friends, including Kathryn Sample and Father Lawrence Seyer, the director of the USC Catholic Center.
The ceremony capped off an eight-day trip to the Vatican, which included a meeting with the rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University and lunch with the American ambassador.
Seyer said the high point of the trip was the papal blessing, which he called “very special.”
“He sort of takes your breath away,” Seyer said. “It’s one thing to meet somebody who’s so well known, but he gives you his full attention, which is amazing. He spent his time with you as though you were the only person there.”
Seyer said that though he had seen Pope John Paul II from afar, this was his first papal meeting.
“You just felt as though you were in the presence of a holy person,” he said.
The trip comes on the heels of several years of fundraising for USC’s new church and Catholic center, which Seyer says will hopefully break ground later this year. As of last fall, $28 million of the estimated $35 million in costs had been raised — with $6 million coming from USC alumnus and developer Rick Caruso.
The new Catholic church and student center will be located on the corner of 32nd and Hoover streets in the same location as the current facility, which was built in 1957.
The center will house a student library, study areas, courtyards and a student union. With more than 10,000 Catholic students attending USC, Seyer said he hopes the new center can be a point of meeting for Catholic Trojans.
“There are many students from all over the world coming to USC, and we see this pope as a symbol of the universality of the Church,” Seyer said. “It’s sort of neat to have the pope’s blessing as a sign for how this church can be a welcome place for USC students from all over the world, something that’s unique about this university.”

Finishing 29 strokes behind a conference rival doesn’t normally make for a successful tournament in college golf.
But in a week that was all about surviving and advancing, the No. 10 USC men’s golf team was happy to do just that.
The Trojans played solid but not spectacular golf on their way to a second place finish at the NCAA West Regional at the Gold Mountain Golf Complex in Bremerton, Wash., and earned a spot in next week’s NCAA championships.

“This was a good week but not that fun,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “It was kind of stressful because the whole season basically comes down to that week. To play well under that kind of pressure shows a lot about these guys.”
Pac-10 champions No. 3 Washington won the regional going away, with three of its players finishing in the top three overall. San Diego, No. 24 Oregon State and No. 12 Illinois also qualified for the next round out of the 13-team regional.
The Trojans got off to a rough start, sitting three strokes out of the fifth and final qualifying spot after a nine over par first round.
“We were a little frustrated that we played poorly,” freshman Sam Smith said. “But we knew there were 36 holes left so there was plenty of time to get back into position.”
Smith, who just secured the fifth spot in the Trojans’ lineup with a strong performance at the Pac-10 championships, paced USC with strong opening rounds of 73-72.
“We felt like Sam carried us the first two days,” Zambri said. “He’s playing the best golf of the year and I think he can even play better.”
USC shot 1 over par as a team in the second round to jump up into a tie for third place. The Trojans saved their best for last, posting a 1 under par final round to clinch their fourth straight trip to the NCAA championships.
“We realized that we had to come in the top five teams and didn’t necessarily have to go out and beat the field by 29 shots like Washington did,” junior Matt Giles said.
The Trojans advanced without any of their players finishing in the top 20 of the towurnament individually. Instead, USC relied on consistent play by all five golfers, posting no rounds lower than 70 and only one higher than 75.
Freshmen T.J. Vogel (74-75-70) and Martin Trainer (75-72-72) led the way for the Trojans, finishing in a tie for 21st at 3 over par.
Smith posted a final round 75 to place in a tie for 24th at 4 over par.
Freshmen grabbed the top three spots for a young USC team that doesn’t have a senior.
“Arguably we have the best freshmen class in the country right now,” Smith said. “We’re showing why with three guys in the lineup each week and we’re steadily improving.”
Giles (77-72-72) and sophomore Steve Lim (75-73-73) tied for 29th at 5 over par.
“I putted really poorly the first day and then actually played okay after that,” Giles said.
USC will be joined at the NCAA championships, which begin Tuesday at The Honors Course in Chattanooga, Tenn., by seven other Pac-10 squads.
Zambri said the Trojans were helped by playing against some of the nation’s best teams throughout the season.
“We just had our best finish of the year and it didn’t feel like we played great,” Zambri said. “Then it dawned on me that we played against really great teams all year. Better competition in the Pac-10 makes all these kids better.”

Maybe it was just me, but during this past school year, classes sure seemed like a drag, especially with papers, tests and multiple projects piled up the size of the Eiffel Tower in my apartment’s not-nearly-big-enough kitchen.
It really seemed like there was no end in sight.
But there is always hope at the end of the tunnel, or that’s what I always hear.
Out with the old and in with the new, right?
As for USC’s men’s basketball program, the ghosts of past legends still haunt the hallowed grounds of the Galen Center — and the Los Angeles Sports Arena before it.
As a Trojan basketball fan, over the years I have witnessed some great players wear a USC basketball jersey.
There have been mainstays like current Washington Wizards guard Nick Young and current Chicago Bulls forward Taj Gibson. One-and-done prep star and now-Memphis Grizzlies guard O.J. Mayo gave the city of Los Angeles and the school a buzz of excitement for a brief time.
I have also witnessed some quirky players come to the land of Troy.
For those that have followed the men’s basketball team long enough, remember Desmon Farmer?  That’s the guy that wore his headband upside down and never saw a shot he didn’t like.
Then there was Jerry Dupree. He was one of those players that always left me scratching my head, and not necessarily in a good way.
Unfortunately, his out-of-this-world athleticism never matched his brains, cutting his career at USC short his senior season because of academic issues.
Then, there was the announcement in 2008 that the No. 2 ranked Rivals.com player  — DeMar DeRozan, of nearby Compton High — would be coming to play basketball at USC.
Along with that news came the even-more-interesting news that Percy Miller would be coming to play basketball as well.
For those of you who aren’t familar with Miller, you probably know him as Romeo, or Lil’ Romeo.
My first thought was, “I knew the guy could rap, but he had game too?”
My second thought was: “Maybe he shouldn’t have dropped the ‘Lil’ from his name because that’s the amount of time he saw on the court — very little, or 19 minutes in two years to be exact.
I don’t know if scoring 8.6 points per game your senior season at Beverly Hills High says much, but presumably former coach Tim Floyd saw something in him. 
And it was something worthy enough to give him a Division I scholarship to play basketball.
Right?
Well, for all I know and as far as the media can speculate, DeRozan and Miller were a “package deal,” — meaning Miller’s scholarship was a sort of appeasement to get DeRozan to attend USC.
But for those skeptics and hecklers — including myself — who chastised and questioned the recruitment of Miller two years ago, our wishes have come true.
He will no longer be with the USC men’s basketball team next year.
And good riddance, because for the little — Lil? — time that I witnessed Miller play, it looked like the school was going through an emergency evacuation drill and he was running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
But the chicken is gone now, and with it comes a brand new era for the USC basketball program.
But before the basketball season started and before the news of Miller leaving, the men’s basketball season was similar to a typical school year.
Like papers, tests and multiple projects all coming at me during the school year, it mirrored the kind of turmoil the Trojans basketball team had gone through this year ever since Floyd skipped town — everything just kept piling up.
And like Miller running around with no sense of direction and with the uncertainty of the future, it seemed like there was no end in sight — or as they say it, no light at the end of the tunnel.
Floyd resigned in the summer of 2009 after being accused of providing improper benefits through a cash payment to Rodney Guillory in order to lure Mayo to come play at USC.
The basketball team dealt with ineligible players and injuries, and then to top it all off, the university imposed sanctions on the basketball program for possibly violating NCAA rules during the 2007-2008 season.
But that wasn’t it.
In March, forward Leonard Washington was dismissed from the team because of attitude issues and just recently, center Davis Rozitis decided to transfer.
One head coach and multiple players were out, one coach was in and numerous sanctions were imposed on the basketball program still trying to make a name for itself.
With Miller, Washington and Rozitis all gone now, only five scholarship players remain from the Floyd era.
Coach O’Neill has brought in four freshman recruits for this coming season, including two top ESPN 100 recruits in guards Bryce Jones and Maurice Jones (no relation), and forwards Garrett Jackson and Curtis Washington.
The Trojans will also be receiving help midway through next season when guard Jio Fontan becomes eligible to play.  Forward Aaron Fuller — an honorable mention All-Big 10 player at Iowa — decided to transfer to USC and O’Neill also managed to recruit a seven-foot potential-packed junior college transfer in DeWayne Dedmon.
And with a team boasting a solid core of underclassmen and transfers that will be donning the cardinal and gold for hopefully the next couple years, the future looks bright and promising.
So with all the distractions that came in the form of one-and-done players, head coaches, violations of NCAA rules, the Trojans basketball team must put its past behind them.
And, not to put all the blame on Miller, but his departure marks a time when scandal ruled the program.
There will be no more scands that Floyd was ruled responsible for.
There will be no more traces of highly touted in-and-out prep stars that may or may not have received improper benefits from agents or marketing agencies.
This coming season will be one filled with many changes — with new faces on the coaching staff, new recruits and an overall new beginning for the Trojans basketball team.
In short, it is out with the old and in with the new. And boy, am I looking forward to it.

By the time Washington State right fielder Derek Jones flied out to end the eighth inning Sunday afternoon at Bailey-Brayton Field in Pullman, Wash., the damage had been done —w both by Jones and the Cougars (31-18, 14-10).
Washington State beat USC 8-2 to complete its first ever three-game sweep of the Trojans (25-31, 5-19).
Down and out · USC senior righthander Kevin Couture has been unable to earn a win over his last three starts despite pitching superbly. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
Jones contributed a career weekend, blasting three home runs, knocking 11 RBI and scoring five runs.
For the Cougars, it was all about the big inning.
Four times they scored five runs or more: six runs in their first at bat of the series, 10 more in the fifth inning of the 20-7 rout Friday night, 11 tallies in the fourth inning of Saturday’s 18-4 beat-down and five runs before Jones’ flyout Sunday.
Saturday’s fourth inning was also a career inning for Jones. He began the 11-run onslaught with a two-run homer off the right field foul pole. And when the Cougars batted around, Jones ended the inning’s scoring. Jones launched Logan Odom’s 2-2 offering to centerfield for a grand slam.
In a series that featured Washington State’s largest margin of victory over USC (14), the most runs the Cougars have scored against USC (20) and the most runs scored all-time in a three-game series against USC (46), one of the few bright spots was the pitching of senior starter Kevin Couture on Sunday.
After struggling through much of the season, Couture seems to have put it all together for the final stretch, compiling a 2.00 ERA in his last four appearances — too bad he can’t seem to get any run support.
Over his last three starts, Couture has pitched 17 innings, allowing only four runs on 14 hits while striking out 15 batters. Yet, he sports a 0-2 record with a no decision because of USC’s inability to put runs on the board.
Against Washington State, the right-hander gave his team a chance to win, pitching six innings and striking out six and allowing only two runs. But for the third straight time in his starts, the USC offense provided Couture only one run.
Jones hit a solo home run in the sixth inning to give the Cougars a 2-1 lead. They added a run in the seventh inning before putting the game out of reach with the five-run eighth inning against the depleted Trojans’ bullpen.
Senior outfielder Mike O’Neill capped a strong week of hitting with his fifth consecutive multi-hit game. He recorded a pair of hits and scored Matt Hart with a RBI-single in the eighth inning. Infielder Hart, a junior transfer who spent his freshman season at Washington State, also notched a pair of hits in only his second start in the last month.
With a 5-19 conference record, the Trojans are assured of finishing last in the Pac-10 for the second time in Chad Kreuter’s four-year tenure and only the third time in the last 75 years.
USC started off the week with a promising bounce back after the heartbreaking loss in the UCLA series finale. Facing a hard-hitting New Mexico State (36-21-1) squad that averages over 10.5 runs per game, the Trojans held the Aggies to 11 runs in a two-game sweep. In both games, USC won in dramatic fashion in its final at-bat.
Tuesday night, a five-run seventh inning by New Mexico State tied the game 8-8 until the bottom of the 11th inning when sophomore infielder Ricky Oropesa deposited a pitch beyond the right-field fence for a walk-off home run. Senior Shuhei Fujiya picked up the win after throwing four and one-third scoreless innings.
Determined not to let Oropesa beat them a second straight day, the Aggies intentionally walked the left-handed slugger in the bottom of the eighth inning with a 3-2 lead and the tying run on second base. But senior outfielder Keith Castillo made them pay with a RBI-single through the right side.
Sophomore outfielder Matt Foat drove home the winning run with a single to center field, and sophomore catcher Kevin Roundtree pushed across an insurance run with a groundout. Sophomore reliever Brad Douthit collected the win after pitching three scoreless innings.
The Trojans will complete their season with four home games this week.

Capping off another successful season in dramatic fashion, the USC women’s golf team fell one shot short of a title at the NCAA championships on Friday. It marked the closest finish since 1996, when the winner was determined through a tiebreak.
This close · Sophomore golfer Jennifer Song and the tough-luck USC women’s golf team finished just one stroke short of first-place Purdue at last week’s NCAA championships. - Courtesy USC Sports Information 
“It’s a terrible feeling to lose by one shot,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “We go into every tournament wanting to win, so this was really tough.”
The No. 3 Women of Troy held the lead in the first two rounds of tournament play, but No. 7 Purdue overtook the top spot on the third day of play. Going into the third round on Thursday, USC was ahead by seven strokes, but by the end of the day, they had fallen behind by seven strokes.
Purdue held onto the lead for the remainder of the tournament, though USC cut the lead to one stroke in the final round.  The team seemed poised to rally and regain the lead on the final day, but its efforts came up just short of victory.
“It was difficult for the team to not see their goals come true,” Gaston said.
Sophomore and All-American first team member Jennifer Song missed a 12-foot birdie on the final hole, which would have forced a playoff. Had she eagled the final hole, USC would have clinched the national title.
“Jennifer gave us a chance to tie. The putt just didn’t go down,” Gaston said. “This wasn’t on anybody’s shoulder. All of us left some shots out there.”
USC’s lead fell out of grasp in the third round when the team struggled on the front nine holes and never quite fully recovered. Nonetheless, the team combined for 1,154 strokes during four total rounds of play, a school record. Comparatively, the 2008 championship team combined for 1,168 strokes.
Song’s individual 5-under par score tied her for fifth place overall at the title match. Playing her last season as a Trojan, Song leaves as the all-time leader in rounds in the 60s and a school record holder in stroke average with 71.55, her freshman year average.
Her tie for fifth also marked the 12th time a USC women’s golfer has finished in the top 5 of the NCAA championships.
The winner of the individual tournament was Oklahoma State’s Caroline Hedwall, who finished with a 12-under par 276. Finishing second was Arizona State’s Jennifer Johnson. Following her were Purdue’s Maude-Aimee LeBlanc, Auburn’s Cydney Clanton, LSU’s Megan McChrystal and Song.
For USC, senior Belen Mozo finished in 21st place overall and shot a team-best 71 on Friday, while junior and All-American second teamer Lizette Salas placed 27th overall. Freshman Cyna Rodriguez matched Mozo’s 71 on Friday, a nice recovery from her shaky third round in which she shot an 83. She finished in 33rd place after ending the third round in 41st place.
Sophomore Inah Park finished in 86th place, playing her strongest round of the competition on Friday — including a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole — to finish with a score of 74.
Battling Purdue and Arizona State, USC was a member of the tournament’s lead group for the third year in a row, and the fifth time since 2003. The second place finish also marked the sixth time in eight years the Women of Troy placed in the top four.
With Song and Mozo leaving the team next season, Gaston said the focus now shifts to recruiting and integrating new players.
“Our remaining three girls are going to be instrumental in acclimating the new recruits,” she said. “We have to learn to be resilient and maybe better people as a result.”

Well, it was pretty easy to see it coming. A movie as silly, as ridiculous, as ironic as MacGruber wasn’t exactly going to produce a soundtrack that Ennio Morricone would approve of.  Without beating around the bush, the soundtrack is at once miserable and ridiculous, much like the movie itself.  The real question is, then, is it ridiculous or humorous enough to be worth your money?
Power ballad · Kristen Wiig, who plays Vicki St. Elmo in the recently released MacGruber, contributed three songs to the film’s soundtrack. - Photo courtesy of Rogue Pictures 
The soundtrack is a bizarre amalgam of ’80s hits and original songs that sound like they could have been just such ’80s hits, coupled with selected audio clips from the movie itself.
The album starts off with “MacGruber’s Theme,” composed by an artist who goes by the moniker Cornbread Compton, which is quite fitting considering the nonsensical nature of the movie itself.  Compton, along with a little support from the Silver Lake Chorus, conjures up a bit of parody through song reminiscent of the musical stylings of 2004’s inane Team America: World Police.  “MacGruber,” the chorus sings, backed by epic orchestration and swooping strings, “that guy’s a f-cking genius!”
Whereas in the movie, in which such an auspicious start sets the tone for the comedic absurdity to come, the soundtrack lacks the context of the movie itself (even with the selection of skits included), creating more than a little difficulty in striking a balance between intentional stupidity and just plain stupidity.  It’s hard because there are two contrasting sides of the album: the purposefully asinine selections — including “MacGruber’s Theme,” some original compositions by characters from the movie and all the skits — are at odds with the serious pieces in the soundtrack, such as the classic Eddie Money hit “Take Me Home Tonight” and the absolutely electrified “Heavy Soul” by the Black Keys.
Most of the collected songs are dusty hits from the ’80s, which provides an element of chuckle-inducing irony within the movie as MacGruber drives his Mazda Miata around, his beloved Blaupunkt car stereo pumping out sentimental power ballads and mildly effete pop hits from decades ago.
When these retro songs have to stand alone on a soundtrack, however, they lose the comedy that the movie crafted, leaving the listener with a whole bunch of not-too-bad, not-too-good songs from the ’80s. Considering the combination of two contemporary songs — the aforementioned “Heavy Soul” and “Tick Tick Boom” by garage-punk band the Hives — with the gaggle of skits and parody pieces, the MacGruber soundtrack just ends up suffering from a little bit of multiple personality disorder.
If you like pop songs from the ’80s, it’s a decent mix — Robbie Dupree’s “Steal Away,” for example, still shines as an indulgent piece of boppy keyboard pop, dripping with Casio-like synths — but it’s not a mix that seriously warrants a purchase. You would be better off buying an ’80s compilation instead.
If you liked the movie itself, the soundtrack simply isn’t as funny, despite featuring skits taken directly from the film; this is, of course, assuming that you found the movie funny in the first place, which might be hit or miss depending on your maturity level.
Vicki St. Elmo, portrayed by Saturday Night Live veteran Kristen Wiig, provides two original songs that appear to have been meant as amusing parodies of ’80s pop clichés but instead are neither amusing nor in the least bit good.
In any case, it’s probably only going to take one listen to the skit “Spill It” for the soundtrack to be relegated to the glove compartment or to the annals of one’s iPod, never to be heard again — honestly, who wants to hear MacGruber’s Neanderthal-like mid-coital grunting while cruising down Figueroa Street?
It’s when all the elements of the soundtrack come together that the bewilderment sets in.  Obviously, the soundtrack was made pretty much by default to accompany the film’s release, as movie soundtracks have an audience basically built in.  The MacGruber soundtrack, however, is a bewildering selection primarily because it is borderline impossible to figure out who this soundtrack caters to.  In some ways it is an indicator of the many negatives of a postmodern entertainment culture in which very few things are ever new or substantial but rather recycled and repackaged in the hopes of attaining superficial gratification.
Of course no one can or should seriously compare the MacGruber soundtrack to the great works of Morricone or Mancini, among others, but modern movies based on parody and pastiche have the ability to create damn fine soundtracks — see Shaun of the Dead. Clearly, MacGruber missed the boat on this one.
In essence, this soundtrack is for all those who loved the movie, those who will find the movie’s dialogue to be the pinnacle of humor time and time again, those who have a fondness for synthesizer-heavy tunes from the 1980s.
Not one of these people? You probably won’t regret passing this one by.

Every once in a while, a television show comes along that captures the world’s attention. For a brief period, it transcends the status of a mere weekly diversion and becomes a cultural phenomenon. In the 1990s, Twin Peaks captivated audiences with a combination of well-crafted mystery and David Lynch weirdness. For the past decade, Lost has been just such a phenomenon.
The show, created by J.J. Abrams, Jeffrey Lieber and Damon Lindelof, premiered in fall 2004. By the end of its first season, the show had already cultivated a massive following of viewers left waiting for more. By that time, the mysteries — both those pertaining to the show’s characters and those surrounding the enigmatic island itself — had been established. Fans were left with countless questions: Who are the Others? What exactly is the island? Where is this show going?
Lost lasted six seasons — four more than Twin Peaks — while juggling a myth arc and universe far more complex than that of Lynch’s landmark series. The show lasted so long thanks to a rejection of traditional storytelling methods that set it apart from other television shows.
Instead of caricature-like soap opera personalities, the show’s characters felt realistic. While other shows stuck with one genre, Lost mixed everything it could find — from horror to science fiction to comedy — and drew from a wide range of influences, ranging from movies to quantum physics to classic philosophy. The vast array of source material made for a show that not only entertained its audience but also taught it about a number of different subjects. Even the episodes were unique in style, some depicting on-island adventures and others offering flashbacks that revealed character motivations.
The show’s evolution in the course of its six years on air was nothing short of extraordinary. In the pilot, Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on a tropical island, leaving a collection of people with troubled pasts to each fend for themselves. Soon mysteries of the island begin to emerge, and the castaways are left to confront the Dharma Initiative think tank, island natives called the Others and all manner of supernatural elements around them.
Despite a slight slump in quality at the start of the third season, the show never seemed to jump the shark; instead, it grew naturally with each plot twist fitting seamlessly into the serialized narrative.
By the time Sunday’s finale rolled around, the battle lines had been drawn: The survivors were the last line of defense against an ancient evil island native, the shape-shifting Man in Black.
So, with a cultural milestone coming to an end, how did the fans take it? With a mixture of sadness and excitement, fans worldwide geared up for a night of revelations and conclusions. With Dharma-labeled snacks and polar bear decorations, many set aside books referenced in the series and prepared for the end of a six-year journey.
With a story as epic as Lost’s, the finale had a lot of expectations to live up to. Aptly titled “The End,” the two and a half-hour conclusion had fans — and even some non-fans just along for the ride — waiting at the edge of their seats for the answers and resolution to a show that had captivated the hearts of the world. So did the finale provide some sort of resolution? Yes.
Not all of the mysteries of the show were answered. Doing so would have been too ambitious, time-consuming and trivial. For a show that made everything important — from suspicious minor characters to seemingly unimportant objects that figured in clearly important scenes — the finale avoided nuance, focusing instead on the main struggle between the survivors and the Man in Black.
At the same time, “The End” was an enjoyable finale precisely because it stayed so close to a crucial element in the show’s success: its characters. Character arcs were rounded out in satisfying ways, and longtime viewers were given a sense of closure in the end. Jack, whose savior complex clearly motivated many of his actions, was given a chance to truly save the day, and Hurley, the perennial everyman, had the opportunity to shoulder the ultimate responsibility.
“The End” delivered on Lost’s premise, providing closure to a show that had evolved from a story of survival to a struggle against an unstoppable evil. But more than that, Lost succeeded in lasting six seasons as well as in incorporating philosophical and pop culture references alike into a brilliant story that defied genre while overwhelmingly appealing to television audiences.
It did not explain every detail and mystery, but did it really need to? The emotional arcs of the characters and the storytelling rang true. In the end, isn’t that what good television should do?
What fans are going to do in the aftermath of the show’s conclusion is a mystery worthy of Lost itself, but for everyone who followed the show all six years, it was an engaging, enthralling and shocking run.

With Friday’s release of Shrek Forever After — according to the film’s promotional subtitle, “The Final Chapter” in the hugely profitable four-part franchise — DreamWorks proves itself not above kicking a dead donkey.
Dealbreaker · In hopes of reclaiming his essential ogre-hood, Shrek (Mike Myers) signs a contract with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), a con artist notorious in the fairy tale world of Far Far Away for his trickery. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures 
Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas return to give voice to their now-familiar characters in the fourth installment in the nearly decade-spanning series, which began with 2001’s Shrek and was continued in 2004 by Shrek 2 and in 2007 by Shrek the Third.
Although DreamWorks presumably could have pulled the plug on the franchise after having produced a tidy and generally well-received trilogy, the studio risked diminished audience interest, low turnout and its own reputation with the unnecessary-feeling Shrek Forever After. But after the success of its first three films, the franchise now appears to be a safe enough bet that Mad Men’s Jon Hamm, Glee’s Jane Lynch, Hot Tub Time Machine’s Craig Robinson and self-confessed D-lister Kathy Griffin willingly contributed their vocal stylings to some of the film’s new characters. The markedly classier septuagenarians Julie Andrews and Larry King also reprise their roles as the Queen and ugly stepsister Doris.
Three madcap adventures in, Shrek (Myers) has now settled into comfy domesticity to raise a burgeoning family of baby ogres with his wife, full-time ogre Princess Fiona (Diaz). But Shrek’s happily-ever-after turns out to be not quite what he expected: His beloved swamp, formerly a bastion of ferocity, independence and unrefined living, now more resembles a day care than a bachelor pad, and the overwhelming responsibilities of paternity keep him from doing the things he loves most.
Beyond negotiating a tough transition into fatherhood, Shrek — now something of a celebrity in the wake of his recent heroics and marriage into royalty — must also contend with newfound feelings of emasculation. His roar no longer elicits shrieks but applause, and villagers no longer brandish pitchforks at him to keep him at bay but rather in hopes that he’ll autograph them.
After an outburst at the triplets Fergus, Farkle and Felicia’s first birthday, a dissatisfied Shrek is approached by the diminutive deal maker Rumpelstiltskin, a notorious swindler whose magically binding contracts are infamous for their deceitful fine print. Enticed by the prospect of reclaiming his ogre-hood, Shrek agrees to trade one day from his youth that Rumpelstiltskin alleges he won’t even miss for one day “to feel like a real ogre again.”
When Shrek signs the contract, he’s plunged into an alternate reality in which Puss in Boots (Banderas) is a bloated lap cat, Donkey (Murphy) is a beast of burden working for the Rumpelstiltskin crown, Fiona is the leader of a rogue band of ogre freedom-fighters and Shrek was never even born. Even disregarding the army of witches Rumpelstiltskin has sicced on him, Shrek’s desperate attempts to satisfy the terms of the contract’s exit clause — the acquisition of true love’s first kiss — before his 24 hours are up are made all the more difficult by the fact that no one from his old life even recognizes him.
Like its evergreen cash cow Shrek, DreamWorks is also unable to find contentment with what it already has. Despite having what would have been a complete trilogy in its own right already under its belt, DreamWorks elected to bring back the Shrek franchise’s enormously popular characters for a last hurrah. The resultant film retreads familiar territory and rehashes old jokes in ways that are both self-indulgent and tired. For instance, no spoiler alert is necessary to reveal that Puss’ irresistibly big kitty eyes make another appearance for one of the oldest gags in the series.
A film’s being forced to resort to a metaphysical premise is perhaps the most telling indication that the franchise has run its course. Shrek Forever After offers a perfect example of this phenomenon, relying on a plot that is as unabashedly contrived as they come. The historical revisionism enabled by Rumpelstiltskin’s sorcery makes for a plotline that is engaging and rich with Back to the Future-istic complications. But when all is said and done, this sort of story is ultimately inconsequential. Even if Shrek is successful in breaking the contract before the day is over, what is to be gained? His old life will be restored; things will go back to exactly as they were before; nothing will change. It’s hard for audiences to become invested in any story that is so lacking in any semblance of consequence for the characters involved.
Despite the overall feebleness of the plot structure, the Shrek franchise has always been character-driven. All the characters — Shrek in particular — benefit from believable motivations that contribute to their individual complexities. A montage early on in the film, for instance, briefly and effectively illustrates the soul-deadening routine of child-rearing that eventually drives Shrek to agree to Rumpelstiltskin’s offer.
Despite the occasional laugh, Shrek Forever After makes it abundantly clear that the jig is up and the story has run its course. Hopefully DreamWorks will be able to stick to its word and close the book on “The Final Chapter,” leaving Shrek and Fiona to enjoy their well-deserved happily ever after.

Ordinarily, I am not an overly political person. In fact, as a Ph.D student in music history, much of my life is devoted to a retreat from the messy politics of this world into an idealized world of art. However, after a recent experience attending an anti-Israel demonstration conducted by Students for Justice in Palestine, I decided it was important to put electronic pen to paper.
First off, I should say that I fully supported the demonstration. As Voltaire once said, “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” Regardless of whether or not I agreed with statements made by the demonstration, it would be wrong to attempt to silence them.
I should also say that I am a staunch supporter of Palestinian rights. It is my firm belief that Palestinians form a nation, just as much as Jews do, and as such deserve a homeland. It is but an unfortunate accident of history that our two lands happen to coincide — neither side ever asked to be located where it happened to find itself. Moreover, I believe that some of Israel’s recent actions have been wrong and reprehensible.
In my experience, most official representatives of Judaism — rabbis, teachers, administrators —  have emphasized the right and obligation to exercise critical, individual thinking about the issues, allowing and encouraging all to come to their own conclusions. However, there is a disconcerting amount of pressure from within the community itself, emphasizing Jewish obligation to support any and every action of the government of Israel.
All this being said, I was extremely dismayed by the anti-Israel rally. Never mind that it was held on Yom Hashoah, the day of Holocaust remembrance. (Though the group claimed this was a coincidence, shouldn’t it have known the significance of the day?) What upset me more than anything, however, was the fact that there was no pro-Israel presence to counter it. No Israeli presence was there to answer allegations, pose alternative interpretations or offer basic facts in its own defense. Immediately after noticing this fact, I went into the office of USC Hillel. When I spoke to the director of student programming, I learned he was only notified of this anti-Israel rally at approximately 7 p.m. the evening before.
I could write an article about the signs and visuals the SJP posted, but since most people walking by presumably already saw them, I decided to write instead about a heated conversation I had with the organizers. As a pro-Israeli Jew, in spite of all the rhetoric throughout my own experiences watching, reading and talking about the Arab-Israeli confict I always hoped and believed the other side was like me — open-minded and at least willing to listen. During the course of my “discussion” with the organizers, it became very clear that absolutely nothing I could say was right. Even in those areas in which I was in agreement with them, I was wrong. When you can’t even say one thing right, you have to wonder whether it’s a personal attack — if you’re wrong not because of what you are saying but because of who you are and what you represent.
This feeling of personal attack only intensified as the argument escalated.  I was asked what I would do if my own home were being bulldozed. I responded that I honestly didn’t know what I would do, but as I respect human life and limb as well as my own personal safety, I wouldn’t throw stones at soldiers. Another organizer, who had been listening but not participating, chimed in with “he probably would run away and hide.” Another comment came slightly later: “Whenever I deal with these kinds of people, they always have their facts distorted.” As argument and counterargument swirled around one another, the SJP’s arguments became increasingly irrational.
I was dismayed and disheartened by all this. I would have thought they would have been happy that I, a Jew and a Zionist, had come to their display and listened to their message. However, they took the opportunity not to spread their beliefs, engage in rational debate or convince anyone, but to ridicule me. I wanted to engage in debate and ask serious questions. I realized this was not the place for intelligent discussion of issues at hand.
The most serious, fundamental problem in all of this was a particular backhanded comment by one of the organizers. When pressed about Jewish settlements in the West Bank, she said, “Personally, my belief is that all of Israel is one big settlement. Why don’t the Jews just go back to the countries they came from?” This attitude — that one of the two parties involved should simply disappear — is a particularly dangerous one. This is not an attitude of peace, of reconciliation, of dialogue, of solutions. It is not an attitude of justice. It is an attitude of conquest.
As long as one side remains firmly committed to the absolute destruction of the other, there can be neither peace nor justice. Israelis and Palestinians alike will continue to suffer and pay with their lives for the mistakes, pride and egos of those in power. My biggest hope is that Middle Eastern leaders in the thick of things are and will remain more committed to peace and justice than their American supporters.

Joshua, I am guessing you are referring to the Wall event, the construction of a wall on campus that was meant to evoke the separation wall in Palestine and Israel.  That event provoked extreme emotions on both sides, which is understandable considering that there are some very personal ties to those countries and the violence that is ongoing.
There were people from both sides of the issue involved in yelling and shouting but I also witnessed some surprisingly honest and sincere discussion between members of opposing views at times.  Given your account of the event, I presume you were there during one of the more vehement moments, and it’s certainly possible that SJP members were more riled up at that particular moment.  However, I saw every negative behavior you described in SJP ‘organizers’ in students on the pro-Israel side, including some of the core members of pro-Israel groups on campus.
SJP holds events regularly meant to engage both sides of the issue.  For instance, a number of weeks ago, USC hosted some One Voice speakers on campus.  The group is dedicated to creating consensus on the Israel-Palestine conflict and the event included a moderator, and a college student from Israel and one from Palestine.  SJP reached out to some pro-Israel groups on campus and was soundly rejected.  The event became mostly SJP members respectfully debating from a strong pro-Palestine position with the generally moderate guest speakers.  All of us in SJP lamented that pro-Israel students were unaware of the event or chose not to come.
Moreover, I think it is a misstep to make to retreat into art from real life and its suffering only to pop out when things get too loud to ignore.  Without entering into the debate of whether he supported or was against the Israel that came to be, Einstein is respected by many on both sides of the issue.  He said: “The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.”
I invite you to come to other events hosted by SJP and maybe some positive discussion will result.
“Not only did he eschew pro-Israel students and their questions at the end of the event, but he preached radical statements such as “there is no peace process,” “the rockets are a cry of Gaza to the world,” and read fictitious accounts of Israeli soldiers during the conflict last year claiming they saw no terrorist resistance during the Operation Cast Lead.”
You clearly did not attend the event. There was only one dissenter during the Q & A and Finkelstein allowed him ample time to speak, even asking him to return to the microphone for a follow up  at the end of the Q & A. The student refused the invitation. 
I have the transcript of the event if you would like to review it. Perhaps I missed something?
Are you really going to support that he was given ample time to speak? As soon as he started asking tough questions members of SJP imposed a random time limit that they themselves, did not even follow. The only reason he had to ask more than one question was because Finkelstein was flat out avoiding the question completely and the speaker simply wouldn’t let him off so easily. Pretty coincidental for the limit on questions to come when a dissenter is the one at the microphone…
Claiming I did not attend the event which is ridiculous, what is your response to some of the statements Finkelstein made, including “there is no peace process,” “the rockets are a cry of Gaza to the world,” etc. You seemed to leave that part out in your wrongful questioning of my attendance….
Joshua,
I’m glad you shared your experience on Yom Hashoah with the rest of the school. There was, in fact, a pro-Israel rally after the Palestinian Wall was put up. A group of pro-Israeli supporters and students rallied next to the wall, passed out pamphlets, and spoke to every passerby that wanted to engage in honest political discourse. 
I agree with your statement that “Even in those areas in which I was in agreement with them, I was wrong. ” In trying to engage SJP through conversation, most of them did not even make an effort to hear my side either . No matter what I said, I was wrong. No matter what event had transpired, it was Israel’s fault. Not to say that either side is 100% in the right, but SJP must make more of an effort to truthfully listen before they react. 
Part of this has to do with the events they organized this year, namely bringing in Norman Finkelstein to campus using school program budget money. I attended the event as a Jew, Israeli, and USC student, because I feel it is necessary to understand the other side in order to effectively engage in dialogue.
Not only did he eschew pro-Israel students and their questions at the end of the event, but he preached radical statements such as “there is no peace process,” “the rockets are a cry of Gaza to the world,” and read fictitious accounts of Israeli soldiers during the conflict last year claiming they saw no terrorist resistance during the Operation Cast Lead. It is no wonder he has been ostracized by the academic community, and denied tenure from Depaul. In fact, it is a shame that USG’s program board and student affairs did not do enough background research on him in the first place. I am a believer in free speech, but not by zealot Holocaust minimizers who deny history.
Part of the problem is the internal message SJP spreads to its members and supporters by hosting speakers and anti-Israel rallies. I have yet to see a pro-palestinian event where they celebrate rather than demonstrate. The fact is that Israeli groups on campus focus on pro-Israel festivities, while SJP focuses on anti-Israel proceedings. And yet, at every pro-Israel event such as Yom Haatzmaut, there always has to be a Palestinian demonstration in the background…
How can we even attempt to fix the Israeli-Palestinian hatred in the world, when we can’t even accomplish such peace in our USC microcosm?
Just something to think about going into next year…

Having spent 18 of my formative years in Arizona, I think I am fairly qualified to say that Arizonans should be embarrassed right now.
When former Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano was appointed secretary of homeland security for the Obama administration, the state collectively puffed out its chest and found some strut in its step. Had Arizonans known her departure would instigate a reign of terrorizing legislature, they probably would have flocked to Napolitano’s outbound jet en masse, clung to her ankles and cried, “Please — we’re begging you — don’t go!”
John Park | Daily Trojan
The state of Arizona’s affairs is best summed up by a text message I received from a former high school classmate after touching down in Tucson, Ariz., for a quick visit: “Welcome to Arizona! We hate Mexicans.”
I would like to believe that current Gov. Jan Brewer doesn’t really have it out for Latinos, but, unfortunately for her, the evidence is piling up against her favor. Taken with the two education reforms designed to eject any traces of minority influence from the classroom, her immigration reform bill flirts with constitutionality and has rendered her pretty indefensible.
Written into Arizona Senate Bill 1070 is the power to “determine the immigration status of the person … where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States” and for “a law enforcement officer, without a warrant, [to] arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.”
Conveniently enough, the bill also reminds readers that noncompliance with federal registration laws prescribed by Title II, Chapter 7 of the Immigration and Nationality Act — that is to say, non-legal residence —  is a federal crime in itself.
Disregarding for a moment the gargantuan dearth of empathy exhibited by Arizona lawmakers for their fellow human beings, the majority of whom seek nothing more than to eke out a living from the scarce pickings afforded by worldwide recession, the casual observer might note that centered in the crosshairs of this reform are Mexican Americans (and those of other ethnicities who appear Mexican), not illegal immigrants.
A routine traffic stop to cite a broken taillight can now prompt deportation. If a legally residing driver or passenger looks or sounds foreign and isn’t strapped with passport and birth certificate, an outmoded license photo might be a one-way ticket to border patrol.
And unlike airport security, these measures do not racially profile with the aim of protecting law-abiding citizens. At best, SB 1070 is an iron-fisted extension of the Census Bureau; at worst, it’s a declaration of ethnic cleansing.
Outraged celebrities, corporations and even cities, including Seattle and Los Angeles, have resolved to boycott the state, its tourism and its businesses, asserting that money talks, and the restricted flow of cash to the state ought to parch it to the point of submission. Indeed, Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who co-authored the Los Angeles rendition of the boycott resolution, suggested that about $7.7 million worth of city contracts with Arizona could be legally voided.
Critics of the boycott claim targeting the tourism industry, in which a higher percentage of Latinos are employed than any other sector, will only cripple the population that boycotters profess to want to protect. Yet the long-term gains of undisturbed citizenship and cultural respect surely outweigh the short-term economic consequences such an embargo would bring.
Though I half expect a Supreme Court case to settle the matter once and for all, it’s difficult to accept that Brewer and supporters were able to pen such a monstrosity into law to begin with. In a state whose population is about 30 percent hispanic, officials have established a far-reaching witch hunt. And, even if I can’t necessarily boycott the state and all its services for personal reasons, I intend to feel properly ashamed until my motherland gets its act together.
Hilary Lazarus is a senior majoring in biological sciences.
I know that college environments are ultra-liberal, but as a new USC graduate student, I am really quite shocked that a publication representing an institution as prestigious as USC would allow this article to be published. Go ahead and have a debate about the issue. Yes, make sure there is input from people who oppose the law (has there been any in the DJ that support it?).  But to allow this knee-jerk regurgitating of every left-wing lie and half truth about this law is really beneath a publication associated with USC.
Let’s visit reality for a second:
1- All legal immigrants are required to carry documents that show they are here legally.
2 – All immigrants are required to produce these documents when requested by a law enforcement officer.
This is no different than a U.S. citizen being required to produce their driver’s license when stopped by a police officer. The law says that a person stopped by a police office must produce proof of identity. If you are driving, you must also prove you have a license. If you are an immigrant, you must prove you are here legally.  How is this in any way racist?
If a person is here illegally, it is the job of law enforcement to detain that person and subject them to the law of the state and country — the very same way it is done in every sovereign nation on the planet.  How is this in any way racist?  The fact that some municipalities have pledged to NOT enforce certain immigration laws is absurd, and those municipalities should be subjected to legal censure and penalty.
We have a right, as a nation, to know who is within our borders and why. This is the same right that every nation upholds. What do you think would happen to you if you crossed illegally into Mexico? What would happen if you ran a red light in Mexico City, was pulled over by a police officer, and could not show that you were in the country illegally?  Notice I did not specify what race the driver of the car was.
We are reaching a crisis point with illegal immigration. The federal government has abdicated its responsibility for the last four administrations in direct opposition to the overwhelming will of the electorate. The state of Arizona has a RESPONSIBILITY to the citizens of Arizona to do whatever is necessary to protect the citizens.  Letting ilegal aliens run wild is NOT protecting the citizens.
This isn’t a Mexican vs. Caucassion issue — U.S. citizens of Mexican descent do not want illegal immigrants running unregulated through our streets, any more than those of western European descent.  Shame on DT and by association USC, for participating in the race bating that is the hallmark of the Left Wing whenever the discussion even touches on the subject of race.
USC expects a lot of me, academically and monetarily.
I expect better from USC.
The Arizona law will stand.  It must.  It is crafted from the federal law.  If the AZ law is unconstitutional, what happens to the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws?
Other would be immigrants are waiting for years through legal means to come to the U.S. while those from Mexico simply wants to jump the fence and the line to be home free. Where is the fairness or equality in that?
I am wondering how many of the people across the United States that are against this Arizona law have actually READ it? I imagine not too many. As a former law enforcement officer, now retired, I dealt with this exact same issue though in another state. Laws written are enforced by KNOWING the law and how to APPLY it LEGALLY. NO officer worth his/her badge and position is going to become a mindless drone and selectively pick out someone to see if they are in this country UNLAWFULLY. Notice I said unlawfully, why, because as a law professor I once had, informed our class; illegal means a sick bird.
 When ever an officer stops a person(s) for some reason, one of the first things s/he will request is ID from that person(s).
A ROUTINE check of the person(s) will be made for any WANTS or WARRANTS.  IF the person(s) ID comes back as an UNKNOWN, then the officer can start digging deeper regarding who the person(s) is/are. The same applies if the person(s) state they have NO ID. Then the officer is going to be checking them out closer.  This generally means the subject(s) will be taken to the local jail or holding facility while a more complete check, ie: photos and prints are done. IF it comes back that the subject(s) are UNLAWFULLY in this country, then at that time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement can be notified. THIS IS CURRENT STANDARD PROCEDURES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, unless you live in San Francisco, Berkley, OR other so-called ‘sanctuary cities’, which I might add are VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW DAILY.
So, exactly WHERE are the officer(s) acting like the “extermination” teams like the NAZI’s had? WHERE are the officer(s) abusing their SWORN OATH to treat all people the same regardless of age, race,color, sex, religious beliefs, or life style?  WHERE exactly are the officer(s) going out of their way to ‘selectively enforce’ UNLAWFUL entry into the U.S.?  Where are the officer(s) rounding up people by the droves and removing them from society?  The Arizona law just recently passed is NOTHING MORE than a TOOL to assist the officer(s) in doing their SWORN duties.  OFFICERS DID NOT WRITE THE LAW, VOTE ON THE LAW, OR PASS THE LAW. Their SWORN duty is to ENFORCE the law to the best of their ability and nothing more.
I am against the law, but this article is beyond stupid. Ethnic cleansing? Really? You should be ashamed of yourself for writing such trash. Argue based on facts and not hyperbolic rhetoric. You are only hurting the cause.
Rick,
are you just angry cause you are a plumber? How come you didn’t go to college. How about we keep illegals who manage to get accepted into universities such as USC and deport other Americans to their country of ancestral origin for being such epic failures in life. If you were born in the U.S. and didn’t go to the college then you my friend are a LOSER!
Maybe Rick didn’t go to the college but at least he learned the grammar in the school and can put together the sentences without sounding like the childish imbecile.
Having lived in Maricopa county, specifically Phoenix and Tempe for 11 years I too feel more than qualified to make my opinion known. Ethnic Cleansing? Are you Serious. Have you looked up the definition of ethnic cleansing and illegal immigration? Were a large group of Mexicans taken into a back alley, had their arms tied behind their backs and killed execution style in Phoenix lately? NO NO NO. Since you say you spent 18 years in Arizona do you remember when Arizona was forced by our own federal government and the ACLU on behalf of illegal Mexicans sneaking into this country to be provided Water stations in the middle of the Sonoran desert because so many of their kind were dying while sneaking across the border. Do you have to ask why Arizona is so upset? What part of ILLEGAL do people like you not understand? These people, and I am not just talking about Mexicans, but they are the main culprits here, are all breaking federal laws that have been on the books for years. There is no need to enact new laws against illegal immigration if our moronic federal government would enforce the laws already established. I’m all for LEGAL immigration. Hell my wife is a LEGAL IMMIGRANT from South Korea. She waited her 8 years while the paperwork was processed. Her uncle, who EARNED his citizenship fighting with us in Vietnam and her father who EARNED his citizenship fighting with us in Korea, sponsored her and her daughter to come to this country for a shot at a better life. That was in 2005, we met in 2006 at a Korean restaurant and married 2 years later. She went about coming to this country the correct way. She didn’t sneak across the border and drop a kid in the nearest San Diego Hospital and sponge off of everybody. We as American Citizens need to pull our nut sacks down and take a stand against what is happening in this country and that means sending “ALL” illegal’s back no matter what country they are from. I don’t want to live by the adage “I work hard because millions of ILLEGALS need OBAMA care” That is another subject left for another day. Did I also forget to mention that my Korean wife and Step Daughter also speak FLUENT ENGLISH and almost only speak Korean at home. I don’t believe that anyone should lose their native language but when you are out on the street and doing Business in this country believe it or not our national language is English. I have worked hard for this university for the past 5 years as a plumber and would hate to see that my step daughter and my new baby daughter wont get the chance to go to this university for free as part of my incentive to work here because some ILLEGAL needs their spaces in line for a quality education. I guarantee that is not too far off if we keep going the way we are now. It is time to strip away citizenship for anchor babies. Just because you sneak across this border and plop down a kid should not make that kid an instant Citizen with all my free tax money. AMERICA, wake up and smell the crap storm coming. St least Arizona has had the BALLS to do what the idiots in Washington wont do. Good luck ARIZONA.
Rick,
are you just angry cause you are a plumber? How come you didn’t go to college. How about we keep illegals who manage to get accepted into universities such as USC and deport other Americans to their country of ancestral origin for being such epic failures in life. If you were born in the U.S. and didn’t go to the college then you my friend are a LOSER!
I’m a loser because i chose to be a plumber? Are you kidding me? When you’re $50,000/year piece of paper becomes as worthless as you are what are you going to do with your life? My job will ALWAYS be around and i will always make money. Remember who the people are that keep this University running. You think its people like little Mickeys big pockets daddy who keep this going? Think again! I did not EVER feel the need to go to college and have never needed anything of anyone else in my life. I bet you’re sitting in big daddys house right now Pissing and moaning because mommy asked you to do housework for your weekly allowance when you would rather be sitting in your bedroom jerking off to porn. This article and the comments was for Illegal immigration arguements not for an idiot like you to stand on your soap box and spout off how self rightous you are and belittle people that actually contribute something to society and to this University. Go stick your head back up your ass Mickey and fight for air?
No need for crass communication here. True, some don’t need college to go through a rite of passage. As long as you can financially subsist and demonstrate good interpersonal skills, then getting by in society without a college degree is fine. No need for ad hominem though.
Wow. This piece may be a new low for the Daily Trojan. Whenever I think it couldn’t possibly get any worse, you outdo yourselves once again. Only a member of the DT staff could manage to write an article that exceeds all the hysterical hyperbole produced in response to this law thus far. Congratulations.
WE can respect differing views of the AZ law, but I side with the state. As long as the law does NOT imply racial profiling, and only way to check on documents is if there is some reason why the police pulled a car over or questioning a pedestrian(not simply because they are “brown” or dressed funky……………then I see n0 prob with this!! We have to carry our driver’s license when we drive, so why not one’s green card, fi they are here legally? No probs whatsoever with legal immigrants from ANY nation, the prob is……… ILLEGAL immigrants from ANY country; it is soley a matter of following the letter of the law, for any “law abiding” proper resident(with card/document), residing in our US of A………… they are ALL WELCOME!!! take note of these words…….. ILLEGAL, UNDOCUMENTED, from ANY COUNTRY!!!! no racial or social profiling, just follow the law!! pure and simple!!!
good for Az to finally get the ball rolling. Its about time somebody took a stand against ILLEGALS who get across the border to give their kids free health care, free education and even citizenship (yes pregnant women cross the border to give birth so their children are US citizens).   Why is it that everyone wants to side with the illegals…? What I cannot fathom is why people are so willing to forgive these people who exploit our laws, cost us money and dont pay a dime into our ever growing deficit?
I agree with Mr. Ganiere, people choose to misread the law because EVERYONE needs to carry their documents with them, it doesn’t explicitly say MEXICANS, or “those of Hispanic heritage”.
PS- LA cant boycott AZ because AZ will cut off our water and electricity, so that plan was an epic failure along with everything else LA tries to accomplish. Im ready to move to AZ, at least they are on the right track. FIGURE IT OUT
Every state in the US require the citizenry to carry a proper and legal form of ID.  By comparing Arizona Senate Bill 1070 to some form of Nazi rule or calling it “ethnic cleansing” only enhances your own prejudicial and social moralistic viewpoints….. you are the bigot, not the people of Arizona, nor their lawmakers.  This bill provides the same sort of power and authority to check one’s identification and legal status, as required by the laws of the United States.  But then again, you being only a young faced and fresh from the bosom of your parents home, you do not understand the true reality of life in this world.
When you start making your own money, and have to be accountable for the increasing level of a percentage of your hard-earned income to pay taxes, then and only then will you realize that your future and that of your children is being sucked out of existence.  Liberal socialism is communism, and those who profess to want to see “hope” and “change” are not lookin g out fo rthe best interests of our country and its people…. just themselves.
You must open your eyes to the true effects of a non-secured border.
It’s not a good picture.
Many people are purposely misunderstanding the law. The law merely does what every country does. If police see something out of sorts – minor traffic violation, loitering, intimidation, rude behavior, disorderly conduct, anything that might run afoul of any state or federal law, they may ask about immigration status ALSO. If you are in France, the police may stop you at any time and ask for your papers. If you are in Irvine, CA and are taking pictures – you may be stopped. There is no new authority or power granted by this law. It “borders” on a statement that they don’t want any more Mexican gangs operating in AZ
Well, it does day “bordering.” I think you know she didn’t mean that the law = holocaust, so don’t act all baffled and indignant, June. 
I’d definitely warn the author, though, that any comparisons even skirting the holocaust issue need to be massively qualified: in the same way that plenty of people discount Glenn Beck because he’s constantly comparing Obama to Hitler, you have to explain exactly which aspects you’re referring to and specify that you don’t mean Mexican Americans are being “tortured, raped, etc.”  Talk about ‘second-class citizens having to carry their papers, being illegally searched and profiled’ or something, but it will be too easy for people like June to ignore your argument if you just leave it at “ethnic cleansing.”
 By requiring a certain group to carry around papers, it evokes some similar feelings in a lot of people. I definitely think Lazarus brings up a good point about the demographics, though; with a 30% Hispanic population, the rates of 55%-60% support in AZ are a little scary. Nationally, I get it: sure, 51% (CBS/NYT, May 3) like it, because there are plenty of folks in the rest of the country that want to ‘just kick ’em all out.’ I’d like to see more polling within the state, though, to see how the local public opinion breaks down.
Ethnic cleansing? Really? LOL.
1) How many Mexicans have been murdered by the state?
2) How many have been sent to concentration camps?
3) How many have been put to mass graves?
4) How many have been tortured, raped or relocated?
