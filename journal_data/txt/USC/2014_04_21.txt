Former USC and NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was arrested in Calabasas, Calif. on Monday on suspicion of domestic abuse, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Officers responded to reports of possible spousal abuse shortly before 1 a.m. Monday morning and determined that Johnson was involved in a “domestic dispute” with his former girlfriend. Johnson was subsequently arrested for misdemeanor domestic battery. He posted $20,000 in bail and was released later that morning.
A Los Angeles native, Johnson played under USC coach John Robinson in 1994 and 1995, helping lead the Trojans to victory in the 1995 Cotton Bowl and 1996 Rose Bowl. He was the first draft pick in 1996 for the New York Jets, and during his career in the NFL played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys before announcing his retirement in 2007.
He frequently appears on ESPN as an analyst.
Johnson tweeted a statement Monday evening saying, “I would like to apologize to my family, friends, fans, colleagues, and, of course, to Jennifer for what happened last night at my home in Calabasas. Though the true facts will come out as part of the legal process, I can say now, without hesitation, that I did not hit, grab or strike Jennifer, nor would I ever touch her or any woman in anger. I am cooperating with the authorities and will continue to do so to ensure that this personal matter is fairly and expediently resolved.”
Students on campus weighed in on the news of the former player’s arrest.
“I was surprised to hear he was arrested for domestic abuse,” said Jesse Brummel, a junior majoring in communication. “He stated that he didn’t lay his hands on her, and I believe him. I’m interested to see more facts, though.”
Trevor Williams, a junior majoring in business administration, noted that Johnson spoke in one of his classes, and he seemed very     “put-together.”
“It was surprising,” said Trevor Williams, a junior majoring in business administration. “[Johnson] came into my sports business class last semester, and he seemed like a very                           put-together guy, a very smart man obviously. This doesn’t seem like something he would do based on my limited observation of him, but it is disturbing and I hope the allegations aren’t true.”

The Southern California International Review, USC’s undergraduate journal of international studies, hosted its release party for its Spring 2014 issue at the University Club Monday night.
Global scholar · Matthew Prusak, editor-in-chief of the Southern California International Review, spoke during Monday evening’s event. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Funded by the university, the SCIR publishes twice a year and seeks to advance discussion on pressing global issues.
Monday’s event, the First Annual Release Symposium, celebrated the published work of undergraduate students in international affairs all across the globe, and those in attendance were able to network and pick up copies of the published journal.
Distributed globally, the SCIR receives submissions from undergraduate students around the world and staff then chooses the five best pieces to be published.
Editor-in-chief of the SCIR Matthew Prusak noted that the SCIR is the largest journal of its kind on the West Coast, with competitors at Tufts University, University of Pennsylvania and University of Wisconsin-Madison.
“West of the Mississippi we’re the biggest journal in town, and that’s starting to show,” Prusak said. “We get many, many excellent pieces — it’s competitive. We’re proud of the final product.”
He specified that submissions to the journal doubled in the fall issue and again in the spring.
Some of the authors of the journal were in attendance for the release party Monday night. Sean McGuire, author of “Explaining Jewish Terrorism in Mandatory Palestine,”  said he was very proud to have been selected for the journal.
“I’m really thrilled to have been published,” McGuire said. “I didn’t expect to get selected at all because I know the reputation of this journal has been expanding globally, and I know the competition is really stiff.”
McGuire, a USC alumnus who graduated from the university last December with a degree in international relations and economics, wrote his piece for a class he had taken at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
“I had written a good paper for a religion and political science and journalism class … I expanded the paper really with the goal of submitting it to [SCIR],” McGuire said.
His piece studied the reasons why certain minority groups lash out in pursuit of their freedom and analyzed case studies from the first half of the 21st century regarding the Jewish population in Mandatory Palestine –— a British civil administration operating in the Palestine region from 1920 to 1948.
“I’m interested in the question of why some minority groups — specifically religious minority groups — turn violent in expressing their sovereignty,” McGuire said.
Prusak noted that the SCIR fosters a culture of identity for international relations students, and churns out an admirable publication.
“This organization [has] really just become a way for the [international relations] community to rally around its own culture,” Prusak said. “We work together, we create a good product — that’s what its about.”

Last week, the Keck School of Medicine of USC announced the creation of the Alia Tutor Endowed Chair, a position meant to advance the field of reproductive medicine.
Benefactors · (Left to right) Keck School of Medicine of USC Dean Carmen Puliafito; Alia Tutor, donor of the chair position and Richard Paulson, director of USC Fertility and the first person to hold the Alia Tutor Endowed Chair. – Photo courtesy of Steve Cohn
Alia Tutor, a former adviser to the United Nations Office for Partnerships and wife of USC Trustee Ronald Tutor, provided the endowment for the new position.
Alia Tutor currently serves on the board of directors of Indego Africa, a non-governmental organization that advocates the economic and educational advancement of women in Rwanda. She also has worked extensively in the private sector, primarily in executive positions in companies such as Nourish Capital and Yorkshire Global Restaurants.
The chair position will be within the Keck Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a leading institution in women’s health that specializes in complex infertility treatment and in vitro fertilization.
The first holder of the chair will be Dr. Richard Paulson M.D., director of USC Fertility and Keck obstetrics and gynecology professor, who specializes in the study of the fertility of women older than 40.
“Richard Paulson’s  groundbreaking research and treatment have given hope to many couples who feared they would never be able to have children,” Dean of Keck Carmen Puliafito said to USC News. “This generous gift is a testament to his innovation and leadership and will assist him in his important work.”
Paulson has headed the USC Fertility Program since 1986, a division of Keck that concentrates on infertility treatment and the effect of aging on fertility. His work has been published in multiple medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association and Lancet.
A UCLA graduate in medicine specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, Paulson famously facilitated a 63-year-old woman’s pregnancy and the healthy birth of her child in 1997. At the time, she was the oldest patient in the history of fertility treatment.
Paulson noted his excitement over the new opportunity in an interview with USC News, as chair positions within his chosen specialization are uncommon.
“Chairs in this field are rare,” Paulson told USC News. “And although we’ve made a lot of progress in the fields of reproductive endocrinology and infertility, there is still a great deal of work to be done. It’s a wonderful gift from the Tutor family to the Trojan Family.”
His most recent endeavors have involved analyzing the role of vitamin D levels in correlation to successful pregnancies. His division is also researching the absorption and clinical administration of reproductive steroids.
This endowment adds to the list of Tutor family contributions, a name which is no stranger to the USC community — both the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the Viterbi School of Engineering’s Tutor Hall are named after the couple.
This article could be improved, particularly for the target audience, by not assuming the audience has some fundamental knowledge about the structure of institutional organizations. Here are questions I’m left with after reading the article: 
— Starting from the basics: What is a chair? Is it like a position as a board member? If so, what topics will Dr. Paulson discuss and vote on in this position? 
— What will Dr. Paulson’s other responsibilities be, if any? Attending fundraisers and social networking events to promote his work and the school? 
— Will this mean a financial benefit for Dr. Paulson personally? 
— Following that, I wonder what other chairs are also related to this one. Other chairs at the same school? Other chairs also endowed by Mrs. Tutor at USC and other institutions? 
— What is the value of the endowment? 
— Did you attempt to reach Dr. Paulson, Dean Puliafito or Mrs. Tutor to ask them about this? I would welcome hearing their hopes, aspirations, goals and intentions regarding the new endowment. As the official student body paper I’d like to see a little leverage applied to reach the players involved in stories like this. I hope they’d be receptive to a 5 minute phone call with a DT reporter. 
After reading the article I have a nebulous and admittedly unsophisticated understanding that a rich woman gave a sizable donation to the School of Medicine, labeled with her name and Dr. Paulson’s. I’d really like to understand it better than that. I don’t know how that money is to be used or what roles the people involved will play as a result of the donation. Please remember to cover some basics with articles like this and do a little more than relaying what the major news outlets have published. A college paper is the perfect place for delving into the fundamentals! Thanks!

“Did you have a good Easter?” I was waiting in a long line for coffee this morning, when the person in front of me made eye contact. We shared that awkward tight-lipped smile, the one you use when you are trapped in the same space and have nothing to say, but also don’t want to seem rude. Easter was an easy topic for her to bring up.
I’m Jewish (and was determinedly waiting in that line to buy an overpriced cappuccino as a reward for slugging through Passover), but in an effort to make things less complicated, I smiled and said I did. And technically it was true — yesterday I went to brunch at the Rose Cafe in Venice with friends, one of whom does celebrate Easter. I didn’t think anything of it when I returned the question to her.
“Oh, I’m actually not Christian,” she said.
It struck me as funny that two non-Christians were having a conversation about Easter. And it reminded me of how religiously diverse Los Angeles is.
Not to sound too cheeky, but thank god for that.
Last week, my newsfeed was flooded with the story about leaflets in East Ukraine that demanded that Jewish people over the age of 16 register with authorities. Soon, details came out that the fliers, which had been distributed in the city of Donetsk, were not issued by the government, but rather had probably been spread by Russian separatists in Ukraine in an attempt to vilify Ukraine in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.
That these pamphlets were even distributed chilled me to the bone. It’s approximately 70 years after the Holocaust, and in many ways, the world hasn’t changed.
When I first saw the article, I emailed my dad who wrote back in his typically terse prose: “First I’ve seen of this specific development. But not a surprise to me as a student of history. Anti-Semitism is always to be expected anywhere in the world with but a few exceptions, e.g. U.S., Canada, etc.”
My grandfather’s entire family was murdered during the Holocaust in Lithuania. My grandpa was the sole survivor; he got to the United States before the world around him burned. He was sent by friends to a sponsor in Los Angeles where he was able to establish himself near Pico Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard, a burgeoning Jewish area. He opened a small jewelry and watch sales and repair shop, got married and had my dad. For my grandfather, as for other religious minorities, Los Angeles was a relatively tolerant religious oasis. And it still is today.
Timothy Conley, who works in the Office of Religious Life at USC says, Los Angeles is one of the most religiously diverse cities in the entire world.
“There is a lot of migration here from various parts of the world, most if not all countries here in Los Angeles, and when people come here they bring their culture and religious traditions,” Conley said.
Conley describes Los Angeles as covering a religious A to Z — from Atheist to Zoroastrian. For example, he said that there are more types of Buddhists here than in some Asian countries. This scope might contribute to the air of tolerance here for other faiths.
“Los Angeles is very embracing and accepting,” Conley said. “I think it has to do with Los Angeles being full of such diverse people. There is interfaith dialogue in churches, mosques, synagogues that help promote conversation.”
After I found out that the Ukrainian fliers were a hoax, I emailed my dad again, to ask for his perspective on the whole affair. His response was disillusioned: “Truth is always the first casualty of any conflict. But Putin-led Russia is the undisputed king of disinformation. Being a Jew in Russia or Ukraine is like putting yourself in the bull’s eye for both sides.”
I am so lucky to live here. Los Angeles is not perfect by any means, and as a city we’ve had our share of racist and anti-Semitic acts, both major and minor. But every morning, I wake up and on my walk to school, I pass by a Baptist church, a Mormon church and an Evangelical church, all existing almost on top of one another, in less than a mile radius.
So if someone asks me later today if I had a good Easter, when I go back in line for another cup of coffee (because without coffee I  don’t know what to do with myself), I’d rephrase my earlier answer. I’m not Christian, but I had a great Easter. And I’m proud to live somewhere where I’m free to celebrate.

Up-and-coming rapper Lil Dicky is known for his YouTube videos that parody contemporary cultural norms. Some of his most popular videos include “White Dude” and “Ex-Boyfriend.” The artist discussed his rise to YouTube fame, his current projects and his future goals with the Daily Trojan at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. on Sunday. A lightly edited version of the transcript follows.
Internet famous · Up-and-coming comedy rapper Lil Dicky has gained a large following through his YouTube videos. His songs, specifically “White Dude,” combine comedy with critiques on social practices. – Photo courtesy of Funny or Die
 
 
DT: What made you pursue rap as a career?
LD: I started rapping because I knew I wanted to do something in comedy, and I knew that I would have a better chance of getting noticed if I came in through an interesting outlet.
I didn’t want to be a rapper, necessarily. I wanted it to be the gateway to what I wanted to be.
 
DT: Who are your musical inspirations?
LD: Drake, J. Cole, A$AP Rocky and Kendrick Lamar. I like Donald Glover a lot too, but more just as a guy with similar aspirations.
 
DT: So who’s your favorite rapper?
LD: Drake is my favorite rapper … probably ever.
 
DT: Can you see yourself reaching a Drake-level of stardom?
LD: I can see myself being one of the bigger rappers in the world. That’s what I would deem successful.
 
DT: What is it like trying to become commercially successful as a “comedy” rapper?
LD: There’s a stigma because no good rappers have done it … but I’m getting attention from completely different people — people who like rap and people who like entertainment and comedy … So you double your audience. Just because it’s not hitting in a mainstream way doesn’t mean it’s not hitting f–king society.
DT: “White Dude” is one of your most popular songs and videos, and perhaps your most political. Would you describe it as a satire of our hyper-PC culture, or is it just in-your-face comedy?
LD: That’s a great question. I’d definitely say it’s a combination of the two. And I’m not trying to play some super artistic hero. On a macro level there is intelligence behind the satire of it, but I’m also trying to make individual jokes that make people laugh. I believe very strongly in the joke. That’s my philosophy … I don’t believe in God, I believe in the joke. No matter how politically incorrect it is, if it can make people laugh I believe in it, and I think the South Park guys were that way as well … People also don’t realize the satire I’m doing is just within the genre of rap. Looking at the stuff other rappers are allowed to say, and the way they’re allowed to be proud of their race — they do it in a pretty obnoxious fashion themselves. I think you can get away with doing a lot in the rap context because of the way the game has evolved.
 
DT: From listening to your music, one would think that Judaism is a major part of your identity. Is this really the case or do you milk the fact that you’re Jewish because it’s an easy part of yourself to poke fun at?
LD: I think it’s me milking a part of my persona that’s easy to milk. From here on forward you’re gonna see a lot less Judaism … I’m very Jewish culturally, but I don’t believe in any form of the religion. If I were to characterize myself I’d get to Jewish in the first three sentences, but I feel like I’ve over-branded myself as this Jewish thing.
 
DT: What else can we expect from your new music and your forthcoming album?
LD: There might end up being an EP before the album comes out. I’m not putting an album out until I feel like it’s legendary, and I’ve underestimated how long that will take. So in an effort to maintain my patience in a non-stressful way, I think I need to put something out in the meantime.
 
DT: How would you describe your new music?
LD: It’s a very serious combination of funny and serious. It’s going to be your “Russell Westbrook on a Farm” and your “Ex-Boyfriend’ — hopefully on an elevated level.
 
DT: In “Russell Westbrook on a Farm,” you mention conversations with “big dawgs from sitcoms” and dinner meetings in New York City. Are these real elements of your life?
LD: Yeah, the vice president of Comedy Central called my cell phone … Yeah, they are.
DT: So what kind of projects do they want to see you in?
LD: They’re not being like, “We have this for you.” They’re asking, “What are you interested in doing?” I’m interested of making my own version of Girls meets Curb Your Enthusiasm for us — about the post-grad male. It’s also gonna be about a rapper and it could turn very Entourage-esque as the rapper achieves fame.
 
DT: Would you want to write the show?
LD: Yeah.
 
DT: Do you have any background in that?
LD: No. But I’m so confident. That is what I was born to do: write comedy.

WonderCon Anaheim presented by Comic-Con International started off with a bang over Easter weekend, zipping through three full days of sneak-peek entertainment and finally rolling to a quiet ending. For more than 20 years, WonderCon has consistently brought in pop culture fans from all over the country to meet other fans, show off wonderfully self-made costumes and try for a chance to see their favorite stars in person.
Known as the smaller offshoot of the popular Comic-Con International: San Diego comic book convention, WonderCon originated in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1987 and later moved to Anaheim, Calif. in 2012. WonderCon chose to move to the Anaheim Convention Center because of construction at the Moscone Center, WonderCon’s previous venue. And even though the construction is finished, it is unknown if WonderCon will ever move back to the Bay Area.
For a casual fan, WonderCon can be overwhelming. Con-goers often rely on other fans to tell them where lines are set up, and even experienced fans grow weary of asking security where the next panel is located. Despite the holiday weekend, this year’s convention saw full panels, a crowded exhibition hall and artist alley and large gatherings of cosplayers.
This year, WonderCon sold out of both three-day tickets and Saturday-only tickets. But did the hype live up to its expectations? The sheer conglomerate volume  of fans on the exhibition floor speaks for itself. Even hours before the convention doors opened, lines of people zigzagged up and down the halls. Fans young and old lined up around the clock for a chance to get merchandise signed by famous talents of Bob’s Burgers to the cast of Once Upon a Time.
Some of the convention’s most coveted events included a preview of the upcoming Godzilla movie, a preview of Lucy, directed by Luc Besson, and a Batman’s 75th anniversary panel. Unfortunately, all three events were running on Saturday, leaving disappointed con-goers to choose just one due to the long lines. The constant overlapping of popular events, the disorganization of autograph lines and the lack of seating rules within the panels all highlight WonderCon’s underdeveloped potential. If organization and scheduling were better managed to accommodate more than 40,000 people, WonderCon could be as successful as its more famous predecessor. Until WonderCon learns to adjust to its rapidly growing attendance rate, Comic-Con will continue to overshadow WonderCon as the better convention.
Despite the variety of interesting costumes from Doctor Who, Marvel, DC Comics, miscellaneous anime series and other popular series, Game of Thrones decimated the competition as the most cohesive fan base with the biggest cosplay presence. Given the recently premiered “Purple Wedding” as well as the exponentially growing fanbase, it’s no surprise that the HBO series would take the Iron Throne of popularity. Throngs of Daenerys Targaryens and Arya Starks posed for pictures in the Exhibits Hall. Believe it or not, there was a cosplayer for every possible Daenerys costume, from her Khaleesi outfit to a complete nude-toned bodysuit reminiscent of the birth of her dragons. Surprisingly, there was a distinct lack of Stark family members aside from Arya, but they were probably all having a joyous family retreat at Disneyland across the street.
This year, one of the most surprising aspects of WonderCon was the immense presence and support of big-name female characters and artists. Natasha Allegri, the woman behind Adventure Time characters “Fionna and Cake,” saw hundreds of fans of her webtoon series “Bee and PuppyCat,” an animated show targeted toward an older audience. Even though it only has two episodes on the Cartoon Hangover YouTube channel, the show has created a strong, diverse fanbase attracted to the new genre of female heroines who subvert social stereotypes and stigmas. Also, the popularity of Batgirl writer Gail Simone left the other speakers with big shoes to fill. Not even artist and DC Comics co-publisher Jim Lee with the combined force of Kevin Conroy, the voice of Batman from Batman: The Animated Series, could bring in the same amount of support that Simone received on Friday at her authograph signing. Hopefully the visible popularity of female creative minds will change the pattern of the current male-dominated comic and animation industries.
Though the popularity of WonderCon and its sister convention, Comic-Con, continue to grow, there are still few opportunities for geeks to come out and find others who share similar interests. From its roots, WonderCon has expanded into a venue for Hollywood to promote upcoming box office titles. But the question of if the slew of pop culture conventions such as WonderCon and Comikaze will be able to rid geek culture of its social stigma in the long term still exists.
Visibility is the only way to mitigate the stigma and normalize the view of pop culture as not just a hobby but also a respectable line of work. There’s nothing intrinsically more mature about a live-action series  compared to an animated series. It may not be trendy to wear a superhero shirt when the movies aren’t in theaters, but there’s no reason why someone shouldn’t embrace geek culture. As Grant Morrison’s Batman once said, “Sometimes it’s only madness that makes us what we are.”

On Saturday, as the start time for USC’s spring game grew closer, play had already begun in Tuscaloosa, Ala., where the Alabama offense sputtered in its first spring game under new offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin. Over 2,000 miles away from here, the Crimson Tide failed to score an offensive touchdown until midway through the third quarter, which drew snickers from many of the Trojan faithful who remember Kiffin’s struggles at USC all too clearly.
Spring ballin’ · Junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor, who caught one pass for 13 yards in USC’s spring game last weekend, says he improved many aspects of his game during spring ball. The Tampa, Fla. native hauled in six touchdown passes last season and averaged 65.6 receiving yards per game. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
After the Trojans were kept out of the end zone entirely during their first spring game under new head coach Steve Sarkisian, though, the Kiffin jokes stopped. In what was a mostly uninspired scrimmage, the only real noteworthy happenings were that a little kid threw a touchdown, a random grown man scored a touchdown and Trojan basketball player Katin Reinhardt tried valiantly (but failed) to reach 10,000 Twitter followers.
So no, there was really nothing newsworthy to report from USC’s 2014 spring game, except that there were no major injuries and the 17,500 fans in attendance seemed to have themselves a pretty good afternoon. This is not a bad thing by any means and, in fact, might have been the plan all along.
“We kind of held back today and played smart,” redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler said. “We went back and forth, our defense did a great job, and we kept it real simple and, at the same time, gave the fans a show.”
More than 20 injured players were held out of Saturday’s scrimmage, leaving the Trojans thin at several positions, but all are expected to return by the time fall camp starts.
Though Sarkisian admitted that the spring game was more about staying healthy than anything else, he feels that his first spring as USC’s head man was a successful one.
“I really feel like we’ve got our schemes implemented,” Sarkisian said. “For what we do offensively and defensively, which are relatively complex schemes, we got the majority of both of those two things installed and got quality reps at them. When we go back for fall camp, it won’t be foreign to these guys.”
Offensively, the Trojans are nearly through their growing pains in learning Sarkisian’s new fast-paced attack.
When run efficiently, the strategy allows the Trojans to take advantage of their athleticism and get the ball quickly to playmakers in space. At times, the speed with which the offense operates makes it difficult to notice the intricacies that make a given play work, but the end result is nearly always positive.
When the offense hiccups, however, things appear sloppy.
Mistakes are fewer and farther between now than they were three weeks ago, but they still happen from time to time — like on Saturday, when Kessler and the rest of the offense froze at the line of scrimmage, appearing confused, while Sarkisian — whose voice was audible through the Coliseum speakers — shouted at Kessler to snap the ball quickly before calling a timeout.
These types of gaffes are the downside of moving too fast, but they are also the types of mistakes that will go away in time.
“We need to get to the point where we have this offense down perfect in the sense of guys lining up perfect every time,” Kessler said. “We need to get to where there are no communication issues. We can do that. I’m gonna make sure that guys are at every single summer workout, and we’re not just coming out and messing around, but we’re getting better.”
As soon as Saturday’s scrimmage ended, USC’s offensive players were eager to look ahead to the summer rather than reflect on their recent performance, not out of embarrassment, but out of excitement for what lies ahead. They knew better than anyone else that the spring game was not intended to be the indicator of how spring practice went, and they were satisfied with their play during the past three weeks as a whole.
“This spring wasn’t just about today, it was about the 15 practices that we got to get better,” said junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor. “For me, I got better every practice, whether it was weight lifting, field work — it didn’t matter.”
When the Trojans return at full strength in the fall, the real evaluation period will take place. Saturday, though, was a chance for Sarkisian to bask in his return to a fan-filled Coliseum and look ahead to his real debut in late August.
“This is a special place, a special building,” Sarkisian said of the Coliseum. “To come out of that tunnel and coach on that field is tremendous. Hopefully next time we come out, we can score in the red zone and keep tackling and playing defense, and that’ll be the key to success when we come back here in the fall.”
When the Trojans return to the Coliseum on Aug. 30 for their first home game of the 2014-2015 season against Fresno State, that hope will have dissipated, and in its place will be more expectation, more fans and, hopefully, a few more points on the scoreboard.

After a devastating loss to crosstown rival UCLA last Wednesday, the USC women’s water polo team is back in the pool today, playing an exhibition match against the USA Women’s Junior National Team.
Miss America · Junior driver Monica Vavic is one of two Women of Troy who are on the roster for the USA Women’s Junior National Team. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
A home loss to the No. 3 Bruins will likely bump the second-ranked Women of Troy (22-2, 5-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) down at least one spot when the next NCAA rankings are released. Luckily, USC will be able to use today’s contest as a tune-up during a break in its schedule before the MPSF Tournament begins at USC’s Uytengsu Aquatic Center this Friday.
The exhibition will be a unique outing for USC juniors Eike Daube and Monica Vavic, who represent the United States on the Junior National Team in the offseason. Vavic, daughter of head coach Jovan Vavic, leads the Women of Troy in goals this season with 59. Daube ranks third on the team with 36. Daube and Vavic also play for the Coastal Water Polo Club, along with many other members of the Junior National Team.
There will be a sense of familiarity in the air at Uytengsu Aquatic Center this afternoon, as a number of USC’s MPSF opponents will visit as part of the Junior National Team. Mackenzie Barr, Emily Donohoe, Rachel Fattal, Kodi Hill and Alice Williams of UCLA are members of Team USA, while players from Stanford, Cal and UC Irvine will also compete for the Junior National Team.
Overall, 12 of the 15 members of the Junior National Team are currently enrolled at MPSF schools. Even the team’s head coach, former Olympic water polo player Dan Klatt, is in his eighth season as the head coach at UC Irvine.
The Junior National Team’s most recent international game was last August in Volos, Greece, when the squad outlasted Spain to win the International Swimming Federation’s Junior World Championship. Vavic made her mark in that tournament by scoring the opening goal in the United States’ semifinal win over Greece.
The exhibition game kicks off today at 4:30 p.m. at USC’s Uytengsu Aquatic Center.
USC returns to NCAA action this Friday in the first round of the MPSF tournament against the No.  4 Arizona State Sun Devils.

The Trojans dominated the Arizona Wildcats at Dedeaux Field last weekend, coming away with a 3-0 sweep, including a shutout on Thursday and Saturday as well as a 12-inning victory on Friday.
Catch a break · Junior catcher Garrett Stubbs is the only Trojan to have started every game for USC this season. Through 37 contests, the Del Mar, Calif. native is batting .291 and has stolen four bases. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
USC ended the Wildcats’ winning streak with many impressive defensive plays and strong starts from each of the series’ pitchers. The starting pitchers in particular led the Trojans to victory by only giving up a total of four runs for the series. Junior Wyatt Strahan guided the team through nine innings to a 1-0 shutout on Thursday and senior Bob Wheatley pitched a 2-0 shutout through seven on Saturday.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs said the Trojans’ pitching during the Arizona series was a defining moment in the season.
“Our pitching in general was fantastic this weekend,” Hubbs said. “Strahan, Wheatley and [sophomore Kyle] Twomey really got us where we needed to be in terms of pitching smart. I thought they were fantastic and that the team in general played well-rounded games.”
Tonight, the Trojans will try to extend their five-game winning streak against the Hawai’i Rainbow Warriors at Dedeaux Field. The Big West team currently holds a 15-21 overall record as well as a 4-6 record on the road. The Rainbow Warriors have a total team batting average of .236 and a team ERA of 3.47.
The Trojans will surely bring some momentum into tonight’s matchup after right-hander Strahan was named the Pac-12 pitcher of the week. Strahan threw a complete-game shutout in USC’s 1-0 win over Arizona last Thursday.
Though the Trojans are expected to enter tonight’s game confident and prepared after last weekend’s series sweep, Hubbs believes that his team must remain focused on playing its  best all-around baseball to come out with a win over the Rainbow Warriors.
“The series against Arizona has given the guys lots of optimism, especially now that our starting pitching is back on track, but all that means nothing if we come out flat against Hawai’i,” Hubbs said. “Playing on a Tuesday is a different atmosphere than playing on a weekend during a broadcasted game with a good crowd. It’s easy to get up for those games. We need to keep up our intensity tonight to beat Hawai’i.”
Despite the Trojans’ major improvements in pitching and defense, the team still needs to concentrate on coming up with more hits at the plate as well as advancing runners into scoring position. Last weekend, the Trojans only produced eight runs throughout the series.
Coach Hubbs feels that USC will best be able to beat the Rainbow Warriors tonight by running up the opponent’s pitch count and playing smart at the plate.
“Sometimes I think we get too greedy and try to drive the ball over the outfielders’ heads, but that’s not our game and that’s not who we are,” Hubbs said. “We just need to stay low and hard at the plate. We’ll get our doubles and our homers now and then, but we really need to consistently stay within ourselves and not try to out-hit the outfielders.”
Like the Trojans, Hawai’i has struggled to come up with big hits lately, as evidenced by the fact that the team has lost eight of its nine most recent games.
Despite their recent struggles, Hubbs emphasized the importance in taking Hawai’i seriously as an opponent.
“Hawai’i is a quality team who’s been struggling with the bat a bit but pitching pretty well, which sounds similar to our situation,” Hubbs said. “We know that when we don’t play well we lose, but when we do play well we’ll win. We can’t look past Hawai’i because if we do, they’re going to shock us and beat us. For us to be a good team that can make a serious run in the post-season, tonight is a game we have to go out there and win.”
Sophomore right-hander Brooks Kriske,  who has a 1-0 record as a starter this season, will lead the Trojans on the mound tonight against the Rainbow Warriors at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.
Following Tuesday’s match, the Trojans will head to Westwood to take on crosstown rival UCLA in a three-game series starting Thursday.

As members of the Undergraduate Student Government Senate, we wish to address the concerns raised by Tara Campbell in Eric Wendorf’s article “USG Senate rejects tax resolution.” USG’s mission is to represent and advocate on behalf of the entire undergraduate population. No beneﬁt for any group in the student body, regardless of size, is too small for USG to consider or explore. This holds true for the Greek community.
When considering the resolution, we were concerned both about the potential impacts on the larger student body and the speciﬁc language included in the Congressional bill.
One of the driving reasons behind this bill is the current disparity in tax-exempt status of universities and of National Greek Organizations. Multiple senators voiced their concern that if this disparity disappeared, donations to Greek organizations would increase at the expense of donations to the university that beneﬁt the entire student body.
The bill as it stands claims increased donations due to tax-exempt status could support “collegiate housing and infrastructure grants … to provide, improve, operate, or maintain collegiate housing property [meaning Greek housing],” but made no guarantees that the grants would be used for this purpose. We found the language of the bill vague. It does not mention safety and is subject to change. In short, it leaves much unsaid. The bill has been in Congress for two years and has been subject to numerous changes. If the Senate is to support anything, we wish to be sure of its ﬁnal content rather than give a carte blanche endorsement.
We reafﬁrm our support for the Greek community in advocating for safer residences and pledge to work with them moving forward. In a holistic evaluation of the current situation, however, we do not believe that this resolution would have served the goals of the student body as a whole.

It’s startling to think how little I know about life without technology. From very early on, I looked to the computer for entertainment and additions to my school curriculum. I later relied on my cell phone to communicate with my family and friends rather than talking face-to-face. I’m barely able to navigate campus without a GPS, let alone greater Los Angeles. I silently vow never to say to my future kids, “Back in my day we didn’t have …” because these technological conveniences I’ve experienced are quickly becoming a timeless notion.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
It seems like every facet of our lives is controlled by technology. With the dominance of social media, trends in fashion and food are shared with our increasingly small world. In more recent years, fitness has become entangled with technology as well. I have always been one to blare music on my iPod while jogging or put on some television show to divert my attention from the gruesome task of working out. The development of wearable fitness electronics like the Nike+ FuelBand introduces people to physical activity tracking. This makes exercise statistics, otherwise only estimated or absent because they aren’t able to be calculated, available. The slim bracelet collects data based on habits and behavior from a person’s circulations, awarding points for various forms of exercise. These statistics are routed straight to the consumer’s Apple device. On April 18, however, The Verge reported that Nike will abandon its developments in the FuelBand, halting this surge of fitness wearables in the mass market.
The more I think about it, the more it makes sense that the Nike+ FuelBand was unable to engage with the public. Firstly, it’s impossible to ignore the glitches the device carries. When the FuelBand was first released in 2012, The New York Times reported people being dissatisfied with the FuelBand due to its inconsistencies. One might spend a lazy Sunday lounging around and still find the bracelet alerting the iPad or iPhone that today was a successful day of exercise. When the consumer is paying more than 100 dollars for this gadget, they are bound to be disappointed by its shortcomings.
But more than that, exercise technology seems a little bit like an oxymoron. Physical activity should be when people are at their most natural state. Exercise is a natural part of human existence, and technology complicates that. It pushes us to calculate our motions and quantify them in calories or heartbeats per minute. This mentality — that exercising is anything but innate and free — ultimately overwhelms any inclination I have to work out. I can’t imagine I am the only one out there more cognizant of that doughnut I’m burning off than the benefits cardiovascular exercise brings to my body.
Instead of labeling all forms of exercise with a caloric value, people should feel encouraged by the physical activity in which they partake. We cannot deny the problems of obesity looming upon the world, and we also can’t shun the skewed media images. These are definitely the factors that drive us to use products such as the FuelBand, which in the end do very little to teach us the value of our health. Instead, when I think of the effective modes of exercise awareness, I think of Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” campaign or Matthew McConaughey’s just keep livin foundation. These projects start at the very root of our nation’s self-perception problem and educate people about important nutrition and exercise facts.
So, in the future, what with all the hovercrafts and other gizmos bound to be present, I hope my words will last long enough to warn people about too much dependence upon technology products. No piece of technology can actually cure body woes. They might be convenient (and sometimes faulty) for tracking movement, but at the end of the day, it’s how people view exercise that really matters.

The Marvel Studios blockbuster Captain America: The Winter Soldier retained its No. 1 spot over Easter weekend, dropping a soft 38 percent to $25.59M, bringing its robust total to $200.5M. This is one of the best third weekend drops ever for a superhero film and raises the possibility of it pulling off a rare four-peat next weekend, where it will face some lesser competition like The Other Woman and The Quiet Ones.
The holiday weekend actually saw three films over $20M; the Blue Sky Studios sequel Rio 2 dropped in line with its predecessor to $22.5M and a total gross of $75.04M. While this may seem like a hard drop for a family film over a holiday weekend, Easter is a rare circumstance where families will stay home or go to church instead of going to the movies, at least in comparison to Christmas. However, Easter Monday has proven to be a good day for a Easter release to make up for a hard drop.
The real surprise this weekend was TriStar Pictures’ faith-based Heaven is for Real, which opened in third place with $22.52M and has grossed $29.56M since Wednesday. Starring Greg Kinnear, the film, based on a true story about the near-death experience of a pastor’s four-year-old son, is just the latest Christian-based success story after God’s Not Dead, which was just edged out of the top ten.
Heaven is for Real had the advantage of being backed by a bigger company and a slightly more prestigious cast — the film was directed by the screenwriter of Braveheart and Greg Kinnear is certainly more well known than Kevin Sorbo — not to mention that the book it was based on was a New York Times bestseller. The heavenly premise was also less controversial than God’s Not Dead’s atheist/devout debate.
The weekend’s bust was Transcendence, the sci-fi thriller from Warner Bros, which opened to a poor $10.89M. Starring Johnny Depp as a singularity advocate who uploads his conscience digitally (think a higher budget remake of Lawnmower Man) along with Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman, the film was the directorial debut for Wally Pfister, known for his work as cinematographer on all of Christopher Nolan’s films, including Inception and The Dark Knight.
Despite that level of pedigree, the buzz for the film became progressively worse as time went on. In a confusing move, none of the posters emphasized the fact that Nolan was associated, although he produced the film. It could no longer rely on Johnny Depp’s celebrity, who was coming off of two big-budget duds in Dark Shadows and The Lone Ranger, but the previews seem to have taken itself too seriously even if the visuals, as expected by Pfister, were memorable.
The final nail in the coffin was the rancid reviews; the film currently holds a 19 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with some saying that it approaches its theme with the resonance of a bad TED Talk and the bravado of a college student cramming for an exam in ethics. Johnny Depp needs a rebound badly; don’t feel too sympathetic, though, as the man owns more islands than most people own shoes. He’ll next star in the fantasy detective drama Mortdecai and as the Wolf in Into The Woods.
In fifth place was the Wayans Brothers sequel A Haunted House 2, which opened to about half the level as the first one with $8.84M. While the first one wasn’t what you’d consider a runaway success, it still did well enough to constitute a sequel. Focusing its satire on last year’s horror hits Mama, The Conjuring and Insidious: Chapter 2, the jokes seemed on point, but it’s hard for any comedy sequel to do well. A Haunted House 2 also faced more competition than the first, and releasing counter-programming on Easter weekend hardly ever works out.

With three weeks on the books, the 2014 MLB season is starting to settle into a groove, players are getting comfortable with their new teams, and the Houston Astros are still historically bad. Fantasy owners, on the other hand, are starting to realize what their team needs and are looking to give their roster a shakeup.
As with every year, managers are errantly trying to compensate for a quick 0-3 record with adding as many phony quick starters as possible while conversely dropping slumping stars that have done it for years.
This week saw some major add or drop percentages across ESPN, but not all of those numbers are deserved.
Hitters
Billy Hamilton, Cincinnati Reds OF (-8.5% owned)

Congratulations to anyone who thought it would be three weeks before people would start thinking Billy Hamilton was a fraud. An even bigger congratulations to everybody else who still has Hamilton on his or her roster.
Yes, he’s hitting just .214 on the year, with a paltry three walks to compensate, but that just makes his six stolen bases more impressive. To top that off, four of those have come in the past three days. That is to say, he’s heating up and natural progression and experience look to be the culprit.
If he doesn’t heat up, though, and remains a .214 hitter the rest of the way, he’ll still swipe 60 bags for your team. That’s the low-end projection. He should bounce back, as will the Reds offense, and he should be producing across all leagues soon enough.
Devin Mesoraco, Cincinnati Reds C (+33.1% owned)
I could have talked about Neil Walker or Mesoraco here, and I chose the latter because he’s less known and, spoiler alert: Walker will produce more or less the same amount as he did last year with a couple more homers than expected.
Mesoraco, on the other hand, was probably not expected to be on the fantasy radar unless you really know a team’s prospects or you’re in a three-catcher league. One of the Reds’ top prospects, Mesoraco started the season irrelevantly sitting on the disabled list, letting Brayan Peña start in his place. Upon his return, he’s hitting .483 with three home runs in just under 30 at bats.
While those extrapolated 60 home runs won’t hold up, I can definitely see another 20 on its way onto a top five season out of the catcher position. This guy should be owned in all formats.
Pitchers
Jesse Chavez, Oakland Athletics SP (+77.2% owned)

I’ll be honest, I had no clue who this guy was before his first start. Only after my friend had told me that the only reason he heard of him was because he was perusing spring training stats and found that this guy from Oakland was killing it with a 2.22 ERA and 25 strikeouts in 28.1 innings.
I guess spring training does mean something, as Chavez has continued to baffle the rest of the league with an even more miniscule 1.35 ERA and 22 strikeouts in just 20 innings. The best part for those in points leagues is that in addition to the 22 k’s, he’s only served up two walks.
Well folks, I have a strong feeling this is no fluke. Two of his three starts weren’t even in the spacious O.Co Coliseum, and with the Athletics’ propensity to churn out quality starting pitching every year, add Chavez to the list of names of guys that’ll break out with the A’s and be traded in a few years. The strikeout rate might decrease a little bit and the ERA will obviously regress to the mean soon enough, but he will be dependable and useful for the rest of the year.
Everyone
Honestly, with the exception of those that have been placed on the DL (excluding Alex Cobb, who needs to remained owned throughout his injury) and Wade Miley, every pitcher who has been dropped by 10 percent or more of teams needs to be picked back up.
To name them all, that’s Bartolo Colón (NYM), Danny Salazar (CLE), R.A. Dickey (TOR), Drew Smyly (DET), Rick Porcello (DET), A.J. Burnett (PHI), Tyler Skaggs (LAA), Nate Eovaldi (MIA), the previously mentioned Alex Cobb (TB), Ubaldo Jiménez (BAL), Dan Straily (OAK), and Justin Masterson (CLE).
Each of these, except for Eovaldi, are being dropped because of a couple poor performances. Eovaldi is being dropped because many aren’t familiar with the former Dodgers prospect.
But here’s a fun fact for anyone that released the aforementioned pitchers: all pitchers have a run of bad starts. For these talented individuals, it just happened to occur in the beginning of the year. They’ll all bounce back and reward patient owners.
