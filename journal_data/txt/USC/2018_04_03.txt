In a culture that obsesses about relationships — who’s seeing who, who said what about who, et cetera — it is easy to get swept up in the idea that if you’re not pursuing one, you’re lacking something essential to your life. However, I want to challenge this belief with living proof that you can find two halves of a whole in yourself! I won’t lie to you or come up with some cheesy quote that your mom has told you a million times before — you won’t get any of that “you’re single because you’re strong enough to wait for what you deserve” crap from me. Not that any of that isn’t true, but it simply does not make anyone feel better. Nobody wants to be told that they’re better off alone, especially if they’re feeling isolated and hurt.

I myself have waged this war for far too long. I have struggled with doubts and fears about ending up alone, and I’m only 21. Why must we be in a relationship or be “talking to someone” in order to feel attractive, valuable and loved? This is an unhealthy approach that only leads to more heartache down the road. The validation we all clandestinely seek from others in our world will never be able to truly make us feel complete, unless we do so ourselves. We must learn to choose ourselves over what today’s culture says about us and what we should be doing.
If you turn on the radio or pull up Spotify’s Top 50 charts, it becomes glaringly apparent that sex sells. While vulgar lyrics containing explicit language obviously supports this fact, it is the more subtle depictions of modern-day romance that worry me. Young kids and teenagers grow up listening to the lyrics of “Love Story” by Taylor Swift and “Never be the Same” by Camila Cabello. As they grow, their tastes grow with them, eventually tuning into songs such as “I Fall Apart” by Post Malone and “Him & I” by G-Eazy featuring Halsey. These subtle undertones of perfect romance and dependency can develop dangerous assumptions in the minds of young boys and girls, eventually morphing into an extremely high and unrealistic expectation of how their significant other will fit into their life. Starting with songs of sweet, idealistic romance can turn into a slippery slope when adolescents begin to believe that they will “Never be the Same” when they inevitably undergo their first few break-ups.
I find fault in the way these songs paint a picture of relationships. Singing words like “You’re all I need” and “We got that love, the crazy kind / I am his and he is mine” is cause for concern. I frequently catch myself putting too much pressure on my relationships, as if that is a source of life and stability for me. The interdependence and obsession with one another that this culture glorifies is a red flag — an unhealthy combination that will only result in pain and regret, not love and selflessness.
That’s not to say I don’t jam to these songs occasionally! But I am careful to prevent the subliminal messaging within these siren songs from dragging me down to the depths. It is crucial that this generation and all that follow it learn to date themselves. Figure out what you like, what makes you tick and what you want to improve upon. This should be a season of life that is looked forward to, for self-exploratory purposes and a weightlessness and freedom that will never be possessed again. Those that do not value this period do so for lack of self-worth, because they cannot see the benefit of spending time with oneself. I promise you, I have been on both sides of this crazy little thing called love and taking the time for yourself is the best gift you can give yourself. A better relationship with yourself equals better relationships with others. So take yourself out to dinner, buy yourself a slice of cheesecake, settle down with a good book. You deserve a date night that won’t disappoint.

One hostel experience that is forever seared in my mind is from my time in Shanghai. From precariously stepping around loose floorboards to making new friends while brushing my teeth, I made some of my craziest memories in China this past summer. I was fortunate enough to stay near the famous Bund, a source of nightlife and fine dining in one of the most spectacular parts of the city. I spent an entire day exploring the French Concession and surrounding areas with five other hostelers — one from England, two from Norway, one from Sweden and another American. We all came from different backgrounds, yet found ourselves in a foreign country together. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
The beauty of hostels is without a doubt in the connections you make with other travelers. I find that the best moments I have had involved smoking a Cuban cigar in Havana with a Brit (who was utterly ripped off, I might add), discussing veganism with a Frenchman in Montreal, exploring the Shinjuku Gyoen gardens in Tokyo with two Singaporeans and dancing the night away to kpop with a mix of internationals and locals in Itaewon in Seoul. I can’t help smiling as I write this, because these are hands down some of my craziest stories that I will most certainly not be sharing with my kids one day.
Hostels are sometimes regarded as a “less than” way to travel. Images of people roughing it in dark corners of the world with gross communal showers and co-ed dorm rooms that smell like endless hours on a plane is sometimes painted as a less than ideal way to spend your time abroad. However, there’s much more below the surface that makes these hit-or-miss places a must-have experience. Some of my best memories have been made in various hostels around the world, and these (mis)adventures have undoubtedly shaped me into the person I am today — a smart, independent woman that enjoys kicking ass and taking names.
The world comes together in a hostel. You learn about other cultures and countries that you may or may not know much about. With a high turnover rate and a constant flow of conversation, you will never find yourself bored. As someone who has traveled both solo and with friends, I was always extremely grateful for the communal spirit encouraged by the hostel youth culture. I never felt lonely, and honestly thrived on the frequent influxes of new travelers. If you’re looking for a way to combat homesickness, this is the answer to your prayers.
While I have stayed in some stereotypically grungy hostels (I’m lookin’ at you, Cuba!), I have gained so much more life experience from those stays. The memories of showering and air drying on warm Havana nights, hosing myself down with soap on a boat dock in Norway, and washing my socks in a sink in Osaka never fails to make me laugh. I have undergone the ups and downs of traveling in hostels, and I can confidently say I laugh the most at the times when I was forced to take myself less seriously. Traveling is not perfect — and never will be — if you are doing it right. The bus delay, lost luggage and dead phone battery all make up a unique experience that you cannot get any other way. So take a chance! Live a little. Opt for the cheaper way to travel and I promise you’ll have an experience you won’t soon forget.

The February shooting in Parkland, Fla., marked yet another instance of unspeakable tragedy, and our nation was once again reminded that our freedom to bear firearms could have negative consequences when granted to the wrong individuals. The tragedy sparked many protests and movements, from a national school walkout on March 14 to the March for Our Lives which took place in cities across the U.S. on March 24. But this response should remind us of  students from marginalized socioeconomic communities who are frustrated that their own experiences never generate such a public response.
Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
It is taking too long for people to acknowledge that gun violence in urban communities has become commodified, and does not draw the same kind of attention and outrage that Parkland has. On a daily basis, students from urban areas like the South Side of Chicago live in constant fear of gun violence. Although they contain just over 10 percent of the population, the 25 largest cities in the U.S. have 20 percent of all firearm homicides. Furthermore, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black people are eight times more likely to be killed by firearms than their white counterparts. 
The lack of attention to gun violence in these communities raises questions about the public’s priorities. Parkland, a middle-class, primarily white community with an average household income higher than $100,000, drew over 800 protests across the nation. But the number of gun-related deaths in urban areas like Detroit, Baltimore and New Orleans are far, far higher, and are also a gun control issue.
Parkland is another example of how often public attention to social movements tends to start only after a privileged, more respected demographic suffers. In the context of various social movements, minority voices are generally overlooked. Though many social movements speak on behalf of minorities, it is often the case that those in positions of privilege must first be affected for attention to be drawn to the issue. The #MeToo movement has drawn similar criticism, as many felt it was a movement dominated by straight, white women, as well as one that regarded trans, low-income women of color as tangential. 
In response to the movement galvanized by the shooting in Parkland, students in Chicago rallied together to demonstrate their unity and support for the community in Parkland and all other schools that have suffered from similar experiences. But they also used this opportunity to express their frustrations that their own concerns regarding gun violence are shared by the public. A few of the students recognized in their speeches that perhaps their status as members of minority groups from a lower socioeconomic background could be the cause of the public’s turning a blind eye. 
The gun violence that happens on a daily basis in communities like Baltimore, which has set a new record for the number of per capita homicides at 56 for every 100,000 people, is arguably overlooked by college students because it does not affect their lives as directly. Gun violence on school premises tends to naturally galvanize college student activists who relate to such incidents more closely. But our ability to empathize with those affected by certain issues should not limit our empathy and activism. 
As Carrie Zaremba, a student who attended the March for Our Lives rally in Chicago, said in an interview with The New York Times, “It shouldn’t take a mass shooting in a predominantly white area like Parkland to start caring about gun violence.” 
College students are the age demographic that is often the most liberal. They are responsible for spearheading many social movements, and calling into question previously established social norms and precedents. But they often fail to concern themselves with gun violence that can be a daily reality for communities unlike theirs until it affects them or people from communities similar to their own.
Here at USC, sheltered within the gates of our University, we sometimes cannot see beyond our bubble of safety. It should not take a major school shooting like Parkland for us to recognize that 271 homicides happened in Los Angeles in 2017, and that gun violence is a persistent problem in our surrounding communities. Though it often takes mass school shootings to draw the public’s attention, gun violence is an issue that affects countless communities, and every case demands attention and activism.

Throughout March, local TV stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group instructed anchors to deliver a message to viewers that warned against the proliferation of “fake news” by national outlets on social media. The anchors also spoke about the station’s commitment to accurate and fair reporting, and asked viewers to comment on its website if they had any concerns. The comments would then be viewed and handled by Sinclair, prohibiting local stations from interacting with viewers, according to an original CNN report. 
Although Sinclair’s actions can be construed as an effort to be politically neutral and emphasize its dedication to unbiased journalism, it’s noteworthy that Sinclair required all anchors to read the corporations’ message word-for-word, treating them as mouthpieces rather than independent journalists. 
This overarching demand to local news stations by the broadcast company occurs during a time when Sinclair is seeking to expand its stake in news coverage. Last May, the company announced its decision to purchase Tribune Media, an acquisition to be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission. 
In such a politically divisive climate, with the journalism industry under constant attack from President Donald Trump and his administration, Sinclair’s omnipotence should be questioned. 
Although Sinclair currently owns 193 stations under its name and is the largest broadcaster in the nation, the ethics behind a large corporate body dictating smaller outlets’ coverage are concerning, and highlights the disintegration of the ethical wall between journalists and their station owners. This is not the first time the company has overstepped its boundaries by dictating what stations should broadcast. 
In May, The New York Times exposed that Sinclair pushes segments it has produced to local stations, requiring the stations to broadcast them within a specific timespan. Critics say these suggestions from Sinclair highlight the company’s conservative agenda, but regardless of whether the company leans left or right, the independence of its news stations has been compromised.
A handful of employees working at local Sinclair-owned stations have spoken anonymously to the press about the company-directed segments, expressing their concerns about journalistic independence. Many are afraid to speak out publicly because their jobs could be on the line, and leaked emails from Sinclair officials suggest there will be consequences for any employee who speaks to the press. Newsroom employees should not have to fear for their jobs for speaking out against the pressures they feel to broadcast messages that purvey a company’s agenda. 
Sinclair’s actions, despite its claims that its content strives to be politically neutral, demonstrate the company’s desire to utilize local stations to spread messages that align with its agenda. And, whatever it may be, it is clear that Sinclair has an agenda: No ethical news company would willingly push segments and messages toward its viewers if it had no ulterior motive. Dangerously, Sinclair has an expansive reach in its broadcasting power through local news. Thirty-seven percent of Americans often receive news through local stations, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study, and Sinclair owns stations across the U.S. with a concentration on the East Coast.
The news industry is not a goldmine. Too often, the depth of news coverage and the resources a newsroom can provide for stories are dependent on their company’s management, beyond the newsroom’s editorial capacity. 
Newsrooms still work to ensure that the ethical boundaries between business interests and editorial decisions are made independently in service of fair and accurate coverage. Journalism is a public service; it’s meant to serve the interests of the community that receives the news, not comply with the whims of media giants.

Dubbed “Lesbian Jesus” by her loyal Twitter fans, singer-songwriter Hayley Kiyoko lives up to the name in her debut album, Expectations. The LGBTQ icon challenges the status quo of the “typical” female pop star with her music, style and attitude.
Photo courtesy of Atlantic Records.
Kiyoko is a former Disney star- turned pop singer. When most people hear “former Disney star,” it’s hard not to imagine another generic, auto-tuned pop star churned out of the Disney fame machine. However, Kiyoko makes it clear that she’s not anyone’s next Miley, Selena or Demi.
Prior to the release of Expectations, Kiyoko had garnered some publicity with her steamy, creative music videos for singles “Girls like Girls” and “Sleepover.” However, the release of her album is definitely a breakthrough for her music career.
As a standalone pop record, the music, while dreamy and enjoyable, doesn’t exactly push boundaries. However, the message she conveys through her unapologetic sexuality and raw emotion makes the album unique and appealing. Hollywood isn’t exactly filled with openly gay female musicians and Kiyoko doesn’t care — that fact only adds to her allure.
The album’s first song, “Expectations,” serves as a confident and mysterious opener, leaving listeners wanting more for the rest of the album. “Feelings” is a relatable song about overthinking relationships and complicating them. “I walk into this world trying to be nice,” Kiyoko sings. “They say I’ll get hurt if I’m not like ice.”
In “He’ll Never Love You,” Kiyoko reminds listeners that she can treat a girl better than any man (or woman). Expectations ends wistfully with “Let It Be,” which is slower and more emotional than the other songs. It wraps up the record with a sense of calm acceptance about the way things will be, despite them not being what she wanted in the beginning.
With a sensual, edgy sound reminiscent of a mix of Lorde and Halsey, Kiyoko’s sound occupies a space between pop and R&B with a dash of angst. A collaboration with Kehlani in “What I Need” strategically puts her on the map in the music industry, and associates her with a fellow badass LGBT female singer.
Judging from the positive response to her debut album, Kiyoko is only going to get bigger and bigger. With her refreshing authenticity, one-of-a-kind style and extremely loyal fan base, Kiyoko is only going to keep exceeding expectations.

Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
If you know me or keep up with this column, you already know that I dedicate my entire existence to opera. I live and breathe the art form so wholeheartedly that I find I cannot go a single day without listening to my favorite composers, like Handel or Verdi. Even when traveling, my sole priority is to check out the different opera houses in each city I visit. Some travel for food, and others to experience alternate cultures. I, however, travel for music.
I’ve been to New York City about eight or nine times in my life, and each time I’ve seen a show at the Metropolitan Opera. My sister Yasmin lives in New York City, providing me with a permanent couch to sleep on so I find that I time my visits based on which shows I want to see (sorry, Yasmin). I was there just last week to see Phelim McDermott’s new production of Mozart’s Così fan tutte by the Met. Having heard about this production through the grapevine for some years now, I bought my tickets well in advance — there was no way I was going to miss this one. The story is updated to Coney Island in the ’50s, complete with contortionists and fire-breathers galore. Having seen Così multiple times in other productions, I was impressed by the aesthetics and still found myself moved by the singing. However, no matter how many times I see it, the plot always has me rolling my eyes.
Così fan tutte has caused controversy in recent years with its problematic portrayal of women, so the fact that McDermott’s production opened during the climax of the #MeToo movement is either perfect or terrible timing. The plot revolves around two young officers, Guglielmo and Ferrando, who are challenged by the old philosopher Don Alfonso’s claims that faithful women do not exist. They are certain that their fiancées, Fiordiligi and Dorabella (respectively), are loyal, so the three men wager a bet to test Alfonso’s theory: Guglielmo and Ferrando will pretend to go off to war, but will return in disguise to try to woo the other’s betrothed. The remainder of the show plays out like a farce, as the fidelity of each woman is tested by her supposed lovers.

The show has me conflicted, because although Così contains some of my favorite music out of the Mozart/Da Ponte trio of opere buffe, the plot is unforgivably troublesome and — for lack of a better word — stupid. Fidelity is a challenge for any couple in a long-distance relationship, but the story paints women as the culprits, rather than the men who intentionally tempt them to cheat. But sadly, Così fan tutte is only one example of sexism in opera. It is unfortunately a theme that seems to circulate widely throughout plotlines of the world’s most famous operas. And it doesn’t stop at sexism — racism, imperialism and more are all too dominant. So, how do we change this seemingly problematic art to make it appropriate for the 21st century?
At risk of playing the devil’s advocate, most of the female characters in Così fan tutte are not meant to be portrayed as victims to Alfonso’s challenge. Fiordiligi is strong-willed and steadfast, and Despina, the chambermaid, exhibits many qualities of third-wave feminism. But that’s not enough, especially in today’s troublesome environment. One or two well-represented women can’t excuse the avalanche of other issues that seems to cause new audiences to stay at arms-length from the art form. The same goes for operas like Madama Butterfly — still extremely popular and widely performed, whose themes revolve around imperialism and pedophelia. As much as I would love for opera to remain solely about the music and how it moves us, it’s just not realistic.
So what does this mean for opera? Unfortunately, there is no overnight solution to this problem. But in the meantime, opera houses must make more of an effort to feature inclusive storylines in their season lineups. As much as I love the smorgasbord of operas written by white men, there are opportunities for female composers and people of color who aren’t being utilized. 
There was a small glimmer of hope when the Met announced in its 2016-17 season that it would stage the first opera written by a woman since 1903, but has since regressed to its prototypical lineup that consists entirely of men. So many other houses, albeit much smaller than the Met, are experimenting in their season lineups. Many initiatives have been implemented to help the advancement of these underrepresented communities, but the major opera houses around the world have yet to catch up. It could very well be that these productions are coming in the near future, since houses plan their seasons as many as six years in advance. Or maybe I’m just being optimistic. But until we see the change onstage, opera will continue to sit on the backburner until it is forgotten altogether.
There is a time and place for the operas of Mozart and Puccini. These operas will never not get stage time. But why produce Madama Butterfly for the fifth season in a row when shows by Dame Ethel Smyth or Amy Beach haven’t seen the light of day in years? The change in dialogue is already occurring. It’s time for opera houses to catch up.

The No. 15 ranked USC women’s lacrosse team welcomed Cal and Stanford to McAlister Field this past weekend for a rematch against its two Bay Area opponents. The Trojans’ Friday matchup against Cal opened the second half of the Pac-12 schedule for USC.

The Women of Troy kicked off the weekend with a 17-3 rout over the Golden Bears. The victory marked the Trojans’ sixth-straight win over Cal, improving their overall record against the Bears to 6-1. 
The Trojans closed the first half of the match with a 13-0 lead. The Bears couldn’t find the back of the net until three minutes into the second half. This was the first time in the 2018 season that the Women of Troy kept their opponents scoreless for an entire half of the game. 
Senior net-minder Gussie Johns played a significant role in the Trojans’ first half shutout against the Bears. Later in the weekend, Johns recorded her 11th double-digit save game of her career with a season-high 13 stops against Stanford. 
Cal’s only goals came within the first 15 minutes of the second half, in which the Bears went on a 3-1 scoring run. These were the only goals scored by the Golden Bears before USC closed out the game with 3 goals of their own by freshman midfielders Kelsey Huff and Sophia Donovan and attacker Katie DeFeo. 
Huff scored a career-high 4 goals against the Golden Bears and proved to be an important asset for the Trojans not only against the Bears but also against Stanford later that weekend. The Women of Troy were eager to play Stanford, who defeated the them 12-11 in overtime last Sunday at Stanford. 
In the Trojans’ rematch against the Cardinal, sophomore midfielder Kaeli Huff posted her second hat trick of the season, notching the fifth in her career.
The Women of Troy recorded an optimistic first half with a 7-6 lead against the Cardinal. The Trojans were able to claim the game’s first 2-goal lead at 10-8 with a little over 20 minutes left on the clock.
However, Stanford junior midfielder Areta Buness, freshman attacker Galen Lew and graduate student attacker Kelsey Murray combined to net 3 goals within the span of one minute to push the Cardinal ahead, 11-10, with 15 minutes left on the clock.
With seven minutes left in the game, sophomore attacker Izzy McMahon scored her fourth goal in the game, matching her career-high, helping the Trojans maintain a 1-point lead over the Cardinal. McMahon also notched her third hat trick of the season.
Junior midfielder Emily Concialdi tallied a career-high 5 points and registered the first two assists of her career. Concialdi also achieved her second-career hat trick.
This match marked the first time the Women of Troy have played the Cardinal at McAlister Field. USC played against the Cardinal at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in past seasons where USC is 3-0.
Ultimately, the Trojans fell to the Cardinal with a final score of 14-11. The victory granted Stanford sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 standings.
The Trojans’ weekend split leaves the Women of Troy with a 7-5 overall record. USC is currently sitting at third place in the Pac-12, behind Colorado and Stanford, respectively.
The Women of Troy will now go on a two-game road trip to face off against No. 16 Colorado and then Oregon.

This past Saturday, the unranked USC Trojans competed against No. 3 UCLA at home and upset the Bruins with a five-set victory. After falling in the first set 18-25, the Men of Troy won the next two sets, both 25-23. UCLA then claimed the fourth set 19-25, to which USC responded by rallying and claiming victory over the match with a 15-11 fifth set. It was head coach Jeff Nygaard’s first victory over his alma mater after serving in his position for three years.

It was the Trojans’ Senior Night, honoring opposite hitter Jon Rivera, setter Gert Lisha, middle blocker Connor Inlow and outside hitter Jack Wyett. Rivera recorded one kill and three digs. Lisha ran the offense with a stellar performance, boasting 50 assists by the end of the night. Lisha also showed up defensively with 11 digs. Inlow had one kill while Wyett put up 18 kills, eight digs and one ace.
Junior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso attributed some of the Trojans’ success to the atmosphere of the night.
“I think that being Senior Night, the last home game of the season, and a big rivalry against UCLA, we had a really good week of practice,” Grasso said. “We were super focused going in.”
Grasso also thought the Trojans’ mental game was a strong point in their performance.
“We were positive the whole time as opposed to after a bad play or call from the refs we reacted negatively towards the game,” Grasso said. “Also what was different was the effort and the discipline. We knew it was an important game for us to win and everyone was 100 percent.”
In addition to the seniors, Grasso was a big factor in the win. He had 20 kills, the most of the team, with a .441 hitting percentage. Grasso also added two aces and two digs. Freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis put up 10 kills and a .471 hitting percentage, adding five blocks. Junior outside hitter Ryan Moss also contributed nine kills and 12 digs, a solid defensive performance. Freshman libero Cole Paxson was focused on the serve receive game with an impressive .962 reception percentage, only recording one reception error in five sets.
As a team, the Men of Troy followed Paxson and did not waver on serve receives. Grasso followed closely with a .958 reception percentage, and Wyett similarly with .929.
The Trojans had an in-depth game plan that they executed very well, leading to success on the court. Their game plan consisted of attacking certain passers on serve receive and a blocking recipe that was detailed for each hitter.
“We were aggravating them early,” Lisha said. “They made adjustments during the game and this was the first game where we were able to make adjustments back to them. It was like a chess match, I would say. We were disciplined throughout the whole game and didn’t try to play outside of our comfort levels.”
As for the Bruins, their offense was led by senior opposite hitter Christian Hessenauer who put up 22 kills with a .500 hitting percentage. Senior outside hitter Jake Arnitz contributed with 13 kills, while sophomore middle blocker Daenan Gyimah and junior outside hitter Dylan Missry each had 10 kills. Junior setter Micah Ma’a ran the offense with 54 total assists.
Arnitz passed 28 serve receive balls throughout the entire match without recording an error, boasting a rare 1.000 reception percentage. Senior outside hitter JT Hatch also recorded 28 passes with a .903 reception percentage, resulting in an impressive serve receive performance on both sides of the net. Defensively, Missry led the Bruins with 12 digs, followed by Hatch with nine and Arnitz with seven.
After struggling all season to pull out wins, the Trojans are hoping that this upset will give them momentum to finish out their season strong and clean up their current 3-7 record in league play. They will travel to take on No. 13 Grand Canyon on Friday, followed by No. 14 Concordia on Saturday.

I saw the greatest game of my life unfold at StubHub Center on Saturday, and it was all thanks to Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The Swedish superstar was jetlagged and maladjusted to the LA Galaxy, which had announced his addition only three days before. When he jogged onto the pitch to a ferocious roar in the 71st minute, Ibrahimovic’s new team was trailing 3-1 to LAFC and struggling to find momentum. He fixed that quickly by helping to set up Chris Pontius for a goal only a minute later.
Then, Zlatan did what he does best — in a one-touch stunner he slammed from 40 yards away to tie up the game, then drove in a vicious header in stoppage time to seal a breathless comeback win.
“They wanted Zlatan,” he said, with a grin in his postgame press conference, delivered to a packed room of reporters shoved close together to get a glimpse of the star. “So I gave them Zlatan.”
With his dazzling tricks and larger-than-life personality, Ibrahimovic was a sensation from the start when the MLS announced that he would be relocating to America to join the Galaxy. As the all-time leading scorer for the Swedish national team, his stardom is up there with greats like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and the excitement surrounding his arrival was palpable at StubHub Center on his debut day.
But as he acclimates to America, Zlatan will have to avoid the trap that many international stars in the MLS fall into — a bogged, boring descent into retirement.
The MLS, and the Galaxy in particular, have long cemented the idea that this league is an ideal place for international superstars. After all, spending a few seasons with the Galaxy does seem like a nice way to go out. Who could pass up easy access to the beach, a short drive to Disneyland and warm weather year-round?
But the added barb of this moniker of “retirement league” is that the MLS is an ideal place for worn out, washed up players to go revive their glory by playing against softer competition for a few years. What it means when fans of the European or Mexican leagues call the MLS a “retirement league” is that American soccer still isn’t being taken quite as seriously.
On one hand, it makes sense. I mean, this country can put together the finest women’s team in the world one year, but can’t even scrape together a World Cup qualifier for its men’s side a few years later. This is the country where FC Dallas struggles to top 20,000 at a home game even when the Mexican national team can sell out the same stadium on a weekday in the pouring rain. Soccer isn’t the first, second or even third biggest sport of America today. We don’t take our soccer all that seriously — why should anyone else?
The MLS has been struggling to answer these questions since it was first founded in 1993. Carving out a niche for fans in a country obsessed with football, basketball and baseball, while simultaneously attempting to drag the focus of established soccer fans away from Europe, is no small task. The obvious solution seemed to be to get a name big enough to force fans of the sport to watch the game.
It started with David Beckham, then Robbie Keane, then Kaka and Steven Gerrard, and now, finally Ibrahimovic. About half of these stars (Beckham, Keane, Gerrard, Ibrahimovic) signed contracts with the Galaxy, while Kaka chose an East Coast’s tropical locale in Orlando. They stirred up fan excitement and helped to string along the success of the Galaxy and sell a lot of jerseys with international names on an American kit.
But all of these big names came at a price — they were heroes of the past, former world players of the year who were well past their prime when they arrived stateside. Their time in the MLS was neither the peak nor even an extremely noticeable period of their international careers.
This is the biggest challenge that Ibrahimovic will be forced to face as he digs into his role in his new club. Zlatan is an incredible player, but he suffered a devastating knee injury last year — the first major physical setback of his career. In the moments after surgery, lying motionless on his hospital bed, the international sensation thought his career was over.
That injury is what prompted his move to the U.S., a decision he said he should have made “years ago” during the postgame press conference at StubHub Center on Saturday. His trademark confidence was back after the debut performance, and he jokingly likened himself to Benjamin Button when asked how he felt, saying, “I was born old and I will die young.”
But he also showed signs of his changing physicality — or, perhaps, just the jet lag — when admitting that he had been exhausted in the late March heat, running out of gas after playing only 20 minutes. Maybe this is just another side of Ibrahimovic’s brash honesty, an expected symptom of injury recovery and acclimation to a new climate. Only time will tell how much Zlatan has left in the tank, but it’s a guarantee that he’ll give all of us a show, no matter what. 
And if his greatest legacy on the league is Saturday, which many have been described as the greatest regular season MLS game of all time? Well, that’s still not that bad of a way to go out.

Five students placed in USC Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision Making’s inaugural Student Ethics Competition, themed “Towards an Ethically Sensitive Society,” on Friday. Graduate student Jacqueline Orr received first place followed by graduate student David Newman and sophomore Fiona Sequeira who tied for second and graduate students Rashi Chaudhary and Kermit Franklin who tied for third.
The competition gave 27 students the opportunity to present their ideas regarding ethics and decision-making to faculty members from the Marshall School of Business, Viterbi School of Engineering and Price School of Public Policy. Throughout the competition, faculty helped discuss ethical dilemmas with the students and advance their proposals. 
“When you look at today’s issues, such as the Facebook [and Cambridge Analytica] scandal, it’s apparent decisions on ethics crosses many fields and we felt it was necessary for our campus to discuss these issues,” said Ali Abbas, Neely Center director. “That is part of the mission of the Neely Center.”
The committee that decided on the winners of this year’s competition evaluated the students’ proposals based on the significance of the topic, the exclamation of ethical dilemma in the stakeholders, the use of ethical methodology and the overall presentation. 
Sequeira, a sophomore majoring in business administration, won second place and was the only undergraduate student to place in the competition. 
“After the competition … professor Ali Abbas personally reached out to me and told me to be proud of my work given my age, as it sparked a lot of conversation and got a lot of people thinking,” Sequeira said. 
Sequeira’s proposal “Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis: A Procreative Right or Responsibility?” argued that given that the capabilities of the latest genetic enhancement technologies, such as PGD, which can improve in coming years, the ethical questions surrounding the procedure are increasingly relevant. According to Sequeira, these answers will set important policy precedents. 
“Making decisions and developing policies informed by ethics is essential in any area, from business to health care to the technology industry, and this competition supported my goal of wanting to hone my skills as a leader who is able to effect change in the world through ethical decisions,” Sequeira said.
Many of the students who placed in the competition plan to continue developing their proposals. Orr plans to further her work from the competition, “Driving the Future: Carmakers’ Quandary with Automated Vehicle,” with a case study in the Harvard Business Review. 
“It was a wonderful opportunity to participate in the Neely Center competition, and I am honored to have won,” Orr said. “It was particularly meaningful to interact with students and professors across many different disciplines to address a variety of critical ethical issues. I look forward to following the Neely Center’s important work in this area in the future.”
