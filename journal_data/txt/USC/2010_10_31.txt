Sitting in a tie for third place in the conference, the Women of Troy were hoping to open the second half of the Pac-10 schedule with two wins at the Galen Center.

And that’s exactly what they did.
The No. 8 USC women’s volleyball moved to 8-3 in the Pac-10, beating Washington State on Friday night before coming back and defeating No. 7 Washington — the first team to hand the Women of Troy a loss earlier this season — on Saturday afternoon.
USC dominated in Friday night’s match, sweeping the Cougars in three sets, 25-14, 25-16, 25-15.
“I think we did pretty good,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “That was maybe the best of the focuses we’ve had because we were ahead in both of the first two games with good concentration and serving.”
Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter recorded 12 kills, while sophomore outside hitter Katie Fuller had eight. Freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard added seven kills in the match and hit .700 on the night.
“We played great as a team,” Olgard said. “We had a lot of energy.”
Haley praised his team’s strong execution in the match against Washington State, a team that was searching for its first conference win of the season.
“Washington State really brought a lot of heat on us [Friday]. I think they thought the second round they’ll come with a lot of top spin,” Haley said. “We were kind of ready for it.”
Sophomore middle blocker Natasa Siljkovic made her debut for the Women of Troy and recorded her first kill of the season in the second set.
“Natasa certainly got her feet wet, so that was good,” Haley said.
Friday’s match only lasted an hour and 17 minutes, something Haley thought could help the Women of Troy as they moved into Saturday’s match against the Huskies.
“That’s really good because that shouldn’t take very much out of us,” Haley said.
Saturday’s match, however, was a bit of a different story. The Huskies came out firing and took an early 16-6 lead in the first set before winning that game 25-15.
“[Washington] played really really well in the first set, and usually you can’t play five games that well. In fact, usually you can’t play three games that well,” Haley said.
Fortunately for the Women of Troy, that turned out to be the case, and USC was able to fight back.
Down 9-7 in the second set, USC went on a 7-0 run, helping the Women of Troy finish the set with a 25-17 victory. USC followed by winning the third set, 25-19.
“The key for us was to not get discouraged, to not lose our focus and just stay with it,” Haley said.
In the fourth set, the two teams found themselves in a 22-22 tie. Washington ended up winning the set thanks to a kill by middle blocker Bianca Rowland, who hit .500 on the night.
Late in a very intense fifth set, USC had a 14-13 lead on the Huskies. Jupiter dealt the final blow to Washington, recording her 30th kill of the night and helping USC win the fifth set, 15-13, and walk away with the victory.
“Alex was superb. No emotion — just kept dissecting them,” Haley said.
Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana had a breakout game, recording a career-high 21 kills, while also adding eight digs and two aces.
“I think she grew up tonight. I think she’s now a different player. That’s the first time she’s carried the load for us,” Haley said of his freshman phenom, later adding, “She  finished extremely good. That’s another step forward.”
The impressive play for USC did not stop at the number of kills the outside hitters recorded. Serving was another strong component of the team’s performance.
“We didn’t serve as accurately as we wanted to, but we served aggressively, and I was really pleased with how they went after the other team,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy will next head on the road to face California on Friday and Stanford on Sunday.

The women’s swim and dive team earned itself a double victory this weekend, finishing first at the 2010 Southern Methodist University Invitational in Dallas, while also defeating the University of Idaho Vandals at home in a dual meet.
At the SMU Invite, where the team competed against SMU, Purdue, Louisville and Rice, the Women of Troy earned themselves a winning 420 points, with runner-up SMU earning 314. The team proved itself as a force to be reckoned with after winning 15 out of 16 events total.
“We went into the meet with a lot of confidence,” senior Presley Bard said. “We didn’t necessarily have much competition so that showed we have the ability to step it up and race the clock even though we didn’t have anyone pushing us.”
During the first day of competition on Friday, in a meet where eight swimmers and one diver compete, with one swimmer per heat, the Women of Troy swept all eight events they participated in. Led by Bard’s two wins, the team walked into day two of the invite ready to continue swimming just as hard.
“We’ve been training really hard and we were really excited. Whenever you travel to a meet, you automatically have a feeling of team spirit and pride because you’re repping your school,” Bard said. “Our coach asked what our goal was and we said [we] wanted to post some of the fastest times in the country.”
By the end of their second and final day of the SMU Invite on Saturday, the Women of Troy successfully held onto their lead and secured their first place victory, winning seven of its eight events on Saturday.
“People are gonna be looking out at USC after this meet,” Bard said.
Back home at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, the members of the women’s swim and dive team that did not travel to Dallas for the SMU Invite participated in a dual meet against the Idaho Vandals. The Women of Troy won the meet 112-81, with junior Amanda Smith finishing first in two events, the 100-yard and 200-yard freestyle.
“In the [Idaho] meet we were hoping to prove that we have depth even though we didn’t have our top eight girls there. We were really impressed by how they did at home and that really got us pumped up [in Dallas],” senior Lyndsay DePaul said.
After this weekend’s victories, the team’s divers will now prepare to host the USC Diving Invitational next weekend. The next dual tournaments for the team will take place on Nov. 12 against Arizona and Nov. 13 against Arizona State. Both meets will take place at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.

Californians will vote on nine propositions on the 2010 general election ballot on Tuesday, allowing them to have a say on issues such as the legalization of marijuana and the regulation of air pollution.
The latest Los Angeles Times/USC poll, which surveyed about 1,500 likely voters, released results on Oct. 24 showing how voters feel about propositions 19, 23 and 25.
According to the poll, Proposition 19, the ballot initiative for legalizing marijuana, is losing support. Of those polled, 51 percent said they opposed the proposition, compared to 39 percent who said they supported it.
Proposition 19, if passed, will allow Californians over the age of 21 to grow a maximum of 25 square feet of marijuana and possess up to an ounce. Proposition 19 also allows local governments to regulate the commercial sale and taxation of marijuana.
The age of voters will be a large factor in the passing of the proposition, said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political expert in state politics and fellow at the School of Public Policy, Planning, and Development.
“The younger you are, the more supportive you are,” Jeffe said.
According to the poll, 48 percent of likely voters younger than 40 said they supported the proposition, whereas among likely voters 65 years old and older, only 28 percent said they supported the proposition.
Opponents argue the law will cost the state money if local governments set up individual regulatory bodies to authorize the sale and cultivation of marijuana; proponents say it would generate tax revenue of up to $1.4 billion a year, according to the State Board of Equalization.
The opposition says that a bill recently signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is sufficient in terms of marijuana regulation. Senate Bill 1449 makes marijuana possession of less than one ounce an infraction punishable by a $100 fine, and proponents argue it will open up prisons and help alleviate California’s overcrowded facilities.
Opponents also argue that people of any age would have more access to marijuana if legalized, whereas supporters say it would lead to regulations that would keep marijuana out of children’s hands.
“I get that it could help save the economy, but I wouldn’t want my children to be habitually smoking marijuana,” said Brett Williams, a senior majoring in political science. “We can fix the economy without making a sacrifice in a possibly harmful way.”
Proposition 23 proposes to suspend the California air pollution law currently in place until state unemployment drops to 5.5 percent or less for at least a year. Of likely voters, the poll reported that 48 percent opposed the measure and 32 percent were in favor.
Along party lines, 58 percent of Democrats opposed the proposition, whereas 23 percent approved; 34 percent of Republicans opposed, 43 percent were in favor.
Proponents argue the proposition will save jobs. Opponents argue it kills job-competition from other energy sources, such as wind and solar companies.
“I’m totally against it,” said Megan Tucker, a sophomore majoring in political science. “It’s from big oil companies trying to lower their costs.”
Proponents said the proposition prevents energy tax increases and preserves California’s current clean air and water laws, while opponents argue that it would decrease dependence on already expensive oil, threaten public health and cause more air pollution.
Some forestry and air quality officials also back the proposition.
“Environmentalists will consider the loss a win,” said Jeffe, who said she believes the proposition likely lost support after the BP oil spill in the Gulf region.
The California Professional Firefighters and American Lung Association are among the opponents.
“When in doubt, Californians tend to vote no,” Jeffe said, adding that if voters are confused about a proposition or do not know much about it, they tend to vote against it.
Proposition 25, if passed, would change the legislative voting requirement to pass budget and budget-related legislation to a simple majority. The two-thirds requirement currently implemented would only apply to tax law.
According to the poll, likely voters favored the proposition 58 percent to 28 percent. Along party lines, both Democrats and Republicans seem to be in support of the measure: 68 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of Republicans polled said they were in favor the initiative.
Proponents argue the measure would change the state’s budget process and force legislators to submit a prompt budget. On the other hand, opponents argue it becomes easier for politicians to raise taxes and restrict Californians’ right to “reject bad laws,” according to the secretary of state’s website. Opponents argue that it will increase their expense accounts and wasteful spending.
“People are not listening to politicians,” Jeffe said. “People are listening to each other at this point in time. It’s going to come down to who the voters trust.”

It is a false argument that prop 23 will destroy Green Energy Jobs. The moment that the Green Power Industry can get out from under the skirt of government subsidies it will have wild success. Using government to put the competition out of business is monopoly by force; it breeds complacency, not excellent service or high efficiency. (See the big three vs. import auto makers).
PROP 26 is just as destructive as PROP 23. Prop 26 is a treacherous, Big Oil rip-off, which “passes the buck” from oil corporation, clean-up fees to the public’s taxes, which will pay the oil recycling fees, the materials hazards fees and other fees. If you do not understand the ambiguities and the intrigues behind Prop 26, them. vote no. Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell are silent partners behind Prop 26. Power to the people.

Jessie Wise, a 19-year veteran of the Department of Public Safety known for his energy and enthusiasm, died Oct. 26 of a heart attack. He was 41.
Wise words · DPS Officer Jessie Wise interacted with students at Traditions bar and was known for his stories and words of advice. - Photo courtesy of Ray Hudgens 
Colleagues said Wise — who was known as “Big Jess” ­— never wanted to miss out on a day at work.
“Even while facing some health challenges, he told me that he ‘really want[ed] to get back to the students,’” DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas said.
As a community service officer, Wise had taken pride in his work and always put the students first.
“He was able to communicate and relate to the students,” said Wise’s colleague and friend of 22 years, DPS Officer Carlos Fuentes.
Evan Slavik and Chris Sanford, USC alumni from the class of 2004, said they got to know Wise while working as bartenders at the university bar, Traditions. Wise would check student IDs at the door.
“At first glance, Jessie seemed like an intimidating character, but once we got to know him, everyone’s attitudes about DPS flipped 180 degrees thanks to Jessie,” Sanford said.
After graduating, Sanford and Slavik invited Wise to their Christmas parties in Newport Beach, Calif, and would come back to Traditions often for home football games and to visit with Wise.
“[He] couldn’t stop talking about how much he was looking forward to seeing all the students who had come to embrace [him],” Sanford said.
“Wise was the most friendly guy; he became part of our college memories,” Slavik added.
Friends described Wise as personable, and said he had a huge smile.
“He was the type of person that would talk to someone less popular in the department and make them feel comfortable,” Fuentes said.
DPS Officer Ray Hudgens said Wise was never at a loss for words around people.
“Being around Jessie was like going to the movies, because he was a great storyteller,” Hudgens wrote in an e-mail.
Wise’s friends said his generosity encompassed his family, friends and the USC community.
“He was always sharing knowledge and wisdom with others, especially with students and younger officers,” Thomas said.
Within his DPS division, Wise knew and talked to everyone — he was the cheerleader of the department, Thomas said.
“Whenever an officer passes away, it affects the department deeply; you depend so much on each other [that] when someone is taken away, it’s like [there is] a missing component,” Thomas said.
Not only was Wise dedicated to the Trojan Family, but he was also a devoted family man, Fuentes said.
“He was a hard worker and always put his family first,” he said.
Wise had been with his high school sweetheart for 24 years, and was married to her for 12 years. They have two children.
“Wise had a priority to balance his time: working, but also spending time with his family and kids,” Thomas said.
Wise is survived by his wife, Chante, and his children, Cha’Tess and Jessie.

With less than 24 hours before polls open, student political organizations are hoping their increased presence on campus Tuesday will serve as a reminder to get out and vote.
Groups such as the USC College Democrats and Students for Meg will hold events throughout the day intended to increase student voter turnout.
Phone banks will be held starting at 8 a.m. at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, which will become the base for Get Out the Vote activities on Election Day.
“We want it to be impossible for you to be on campus and not know it’s Election Day,” said Micah Scheindlin, political director of the USC College Democrats.
USC’s chapter of Students for Meg will be out rallying as well, beginning today and continuing straight through to the end of Election Day.
“[We] specifically will continue with phone banking and precinct walking, reaching out to voters on a more personal level,” said Anjali Naskar, communications director for Students for Meg. “[Today], we will be on Trousdale [Parkway] informing students of Meg’s plan for California, especially her jobs plan. We will also be dorm storming to talk to students and connect with the undecided voters.”
Naskar said the group will continue its efforts on Tuesday along Trousdale Parkway.
USC College Democrats faculty adviser Marlene Towns said that she believes the reminders will help increase voter turnout.
“When it comes down to it, it’s just a matter of remembering to go vote,” Towns said. “So having these reminders can make a difference. It also keeps people in the spirit of Election Day.”
Scheindlin agreed, saying that if people are reminded, they’re more likely to cast their ballots.
“I think that the reality is people do want to vote,” Scheindlin said, “but they’re busy and don’t know how to go about it.”
Once people know, he said, all it takes is five minutes.
“That’s a message that’ll resonate,” he said.
The College Democrats will be monitoring polling places in and around campus throughout the day Tuesday to make sure voting goes smoothly.
They’ve teamed up with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics to hand out voter pamphlets and fliers, as well as Organizing for America to put on the GOTV events.

USC Athletic Director Pat Haden announced plans Saturday for a new athletic complex to replace the facilities in Heritage Hall, making it the first university construction project announced since the completion of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
New digs · The new athletic facilities will have a courtyard, outdoor patio, weight rooms, student lounges, meeting rooms and offices. - Rendering courtesy of USC Athletics 
The two-story, 110,000-square-foot building will cost $70 million and will be built on top of the current intramural field north of Cromwell Field. The 70,000-square-foot Heritage Hall will remain in use, and its spaces will be reorganized and split among athletic department staff, a workout area and a new student-athlete lounge.
“I am delighted that the president and university leaders share our vision about the necessity and value of this new athletic building,” Haden said in a press release. “This facility has been in the formative stages for a while now and I am excited that we are ready to move forward.”
The intramural field will move to the current location of the Music Practice and Instructional Center, which will be demolished.
The project is the first construction announced by the university since the completion of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, the massive 193,000-square-foot, $136-million building that replaced Commons and the Norman Topping Student Center. That construction project took two years to complete, and the campus center formally opened its doors in August.
Groundbreaking for the athletic facility will begin in January and is slated to take 18 months to complete.
The new building will have a basement that connects to the basement of Heritage Hall, and it will include a 32,000-square-foot weight room — more than three times larger than the current weight room in Heritage Hall, which covers 9,600 square feet.
It will also feature a much larger training room — 18,000 square feet compared to the current 2,700 square feet — and a football locker room and lounge that will be accessible from Howard Jones Field, the football practice field across the street.
“While Heritage Hall will always be the central point of our athletic department, the reality is that we have outgrown Heritage Hall and we are badly undersized and overcrowded in there,” Haden said. “This new building will be the finest of its kind anywhere and will provide our student-athletes every opportunity to succeed academically and athletically.”
The ground floor will feature a new student-academic services area as well as a vaulted lobby and outdoor courtyard. Football will take over most of the second floor with coaches’ offices and video and meeting rooms. There will also be an outdoor patio.
“We are very excited about the number of donors who are stepping up with major gifts to make this project a reality for our student-athletes and their coaches,” said President C.L. Max Nikias in a university statement. “These donors recognize the importance of USC’s legendary athletic tradition and want to do their part to promote athletic excellence and educational excellence now and in the future.”
If I am not mistaken, Thornton got the remaining buildings from CInema which were recently remodeled and will also be getting space in the University Gateway.
While the other 95% of us wait on our fat asses for a gym worthy of the 5 minute walk
Probably more like 98.5% of us, even. Am I missing something or does it seem like the music students are losing their practice space with no plans for replacement?

It wasn’t the end to the season that USC coach Tom Walsh envisioned, but the season itself is another story.
The USC women’s cross-country team placed 10th at Saturday’s Pac-10 championships in Seattle, Wash., bringing a slightly disappointing end to an otherwise solid year for the Women of Troy.
“This year was great because of the progress we made,” Walsh said. “Obviously it doesn’t show up on the Pac-10 score sheet, but the strides we made this fall were very encouraging.”
Senior Zsofia Erdelyi is one of the major reasons for those strides and was a bright spot for USC on Saturday. Erdelyi was the highest finisher for the Women of Troy, coming in 14th overall, a career best at the Pac-10 championships. The senior standout finished with a time of 20:30.27, placing three spots higher than she did as a sophomore.
“I felt like Zsofia almost ran a complete race,” Walsh said. “She had a bit of a bad stretch in the middle, but she bounced back nicely. She always seems to finish strong.”
Erdelyi’s season will continue as she travels to the NCAA West Regional meet in Eugene, Ore., on Nov. 13. There, she will try to race well enough to earn a trip to the NCAA championships in Terra Haute, Ind.
“Zsofia always seems to run better at regionals,” Walsh said. “So I’m excited to see what she can do there.”
The rest of Saturday’s race, however, was a slight disappointment for the Women of Troy. Although USC only finished 12 points out of eighth place, several runners could not duplicate their personal record performances from earlier in the year, and USC fell to last.
“This was a learning experience for these girls,” Walsh said. “Everyone was improving all year, but this was a different race on a totally different level. We have to get better at stepping up on the big stage.”
Senior Christine Cortez finished second for USC but was 41 places back of Erdelyi at 55th overall. Fellow senior Dina Kitayama finished 68th overall and third for the Women of Troy. Both runners finished just off their personal best times.
Junior Leah Gaeta was fourth for USC and 82nd overall, and sophomore Kelly Owen finished right behind her at 83rd overall. Senior Zara Lukens and redshirt sophomore Jessica Lundin rounded out the group for USC, finishing 84th and 88th overall.
“I was happy with our front three runners,” Walsh said. “And everyone else battled too. It just didn’t work out the way we would have liked.”
USC had the unenviable task of trying to make a dent in the nation’s toughest cross-country conference. Annual stalwarts Oregon and Stanford accounted for four of the race’s top five runners, with Stanford taking the title over second-place Arizona.

After an emotional victory against UCLA last week at the Coliseum, the Women of Troy rode that momentum into the weekend, capping off a sweep of the Washington schools at McAlister Field.
On Friday, the Women of Troy (10-4-3, 3-2-1) pulled out a thrilling 3-2 comeback victory over Washington State (6-12, 1-5), ending a four-year winless drought against the Cougars.
Fittingly, it was senior defender Karter Haug’s first game-winning goal in the 83rd minute that gave the Women of Troy the victory and her first win against Washington State donning the cardinal and gold.
“Washington State came out hard against us and pressured us, so when we went down, we knew we had to pick it up and we worked together as a team and pulled through,” Haug said.
In what has been an recurring tendency, the Women of Troy started off slow in the first half, allowing Washington State to capitalize on a corner kick.
Defender Ali Fenter struck a 20-yard shot that freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church tipped but could not prevent from crossing the goal line, giving the Cougars an early 1-0 lead.
In the second half, the Women of Troy noticeably picked up their play, quickly putting pressure on the Cougar backline.
“Unfortunately, we need a kick in the butt to get it going, but we always answer when we’re down,” junior midfielder Brittany Kerridge said.
After forcing multiple saves out of the Cougars goalkeeper, USC finally converted one of its many opportunities off a corner kick in the 51st minute after Haug delivered a pass to Kerridge, who shot a ball into the upper right corner for her first goal of the season, to tie the score at 1-1.
Even after tying the score, the Women of Troy continued to attack the Cougar backline.
In the 58th minute, senior forward Megan Ohai headed a ball off to the right to freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano, who lofted a shot into the left side of the net over the outstretched hands of the Cougars goalkeeper for a 2-1 advantage.
The lead was short-lived, however, as Washington State immediately responded three minutes later — defender Rachael Doyle converted on a 25-yard free kick that pulled the Cougars even at 2-2.
But not wanting to end another game in a tie, Haug took the game into her own hands, finishing off the comeback victory and giving the Women of Troy a 3-2 win.
“You have to give Washington State credit. They were scrappy and came in with a great game plan, and they took it to us,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “Fortunately, the ladies stepped up. We just fought in the second half and that was the biggest difference.”
On Sunday, the Women of Troy (11-4-3, 4-2-1) honored their three seniors — Haug, Ohai and midfielder Alyssa Dávila — and capped off the Senior Day festivities with a 2-0 victory against the Washington Huskies (11-7-1, 4-4).
“We wanted to come out hard,” Sandoval said. “We knew they were a strong team and we just wanted to win for our seniors.”
USC started strong in the first half, controlling possession of the ball and creating multiple scoring opportunities for themselves.
In the 44th minute, Haug set up junior midfielder Carly Butcher, who blasted a shot to the bottom right post to give the Women of Troy a 1-0 advantage going into halftime.
The second half saw both teams go back and forth, with each team getting opportunities to put the ball in the back of the net.
In the 79th minute, Sandoval gave the Women of Troy a two-goal cushion with a header off a corner kick by Haug, sealing the victory for the team.
Not to overshadow the accomplishments of the defense, the USC backline held strong in shutting down the Huskies offense and freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church recorded her fifth shutout of the year.
“Our defense has been amazing,” Dávila said. “Megan Morrow went down, but it’s good to see that our defense gets it done regardless of what happens.” 
Dávila said the win was satisfying.
“It feels really good to win our last home game here,” Dávila said. “Our team played really well and came together to get the win for the seniors.”

On Saturday, the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (18-2) did what is expected of championship-caliber teams: play fiercely even against weaker opposition.
Helping hand · Sophomore driver Tobias Preuss contributed a goal for the Trojans on Saturday as they narrowly defeated Pacific 9-8. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
Improving their win streak to three games, the Trojans eked out a 9-8 win against an improved No. 7 Pacific (12-7) team, before thrashing Concordia (11-12) 15-7.
Entering the Pacific match, the Trojans were seeking to improve an underwhelming 2-2 Montain Pacific Sports Federation conference record that belied a sterling overall record. Although the Trojans never trailed, they were also never able to establish a comfortable lead.
With two minutes remaining in the game, the teams were tied at eight goals apiece. In its next possession, USC looked to two of its primary offensive leaders all season to secure a victory. After freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie drew an ejection, USC capitalized on its 6-5 advantage as junior driver Peter Kurzeka tallied the game-winning goal with 1:26 left.
True to form, USC never took Pacific lightly. Following the game, USC coach Jovan Vavic complimented Pacific, expressing no dismay that his team only managed a one-goal margin of victory.
“Every time we scored a goal, they did a good job of not giving up. They came back and had a good plan of how to attack us,” Vavic said. “They played better defense than what they have done in years past.”
The quick turnaround game against Concordia was not as tight an affair, but it still presented a conditioning test for the Trojans and allowed Vavic to insert some players into the lineup who have not logged many minutes this season.
“There were two players who really impressed me, [freshmen two-meters Max] Hurst-Mendoza and [Connor] Virjee,” Vavic said. “Virjee played really well, scored two big goals when we needed them. Max drew three ejections and scored two goals, which is awesome.”
Junior two-meter Matt Burton, who scored two goals this weekend, said his team should be proud of its performance — especially because the offense received contributions from a plethora of players, with eight different goal scorers against Pacific and 10 against Concordia.
“Concordia definitely has the talent to be a top-tier team, but fortunately for us, they didn’t really show up,” Burton said. “We got off to an early lead and just coasted from there.”
Unfortunately, the Trojans do not have much time to savor these victories, as No. 3 UCLA will invade McDonald’s Swim Stadium next weekend. Not only is national seeding at stake but also confidence entering the postseason. To win next weekend, Burton believes the team’s defense needs to improve.
“Defense has been an area of struggle over pretty much the entire year,” Burton said. “If you look at past teams that have won national championships here, you’ll notice that they kept teams to about five goals per game. Right now, we’re giving up about nine or 10 goals per game. That’s unacceptable for a USC team that wants to win a championship.”

The story: The No. 24 Trojans put in a strong effort but ultimately did not have enough offense for the No. 1 Ducks, falling 53-32 at the Coliseum.
Scrambling · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley looks downfield to pass against Oregon on Saturday. The Trojans lost the game 53-32. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
USC came out of halftime and rattled off two quick touchdowns to take the 32-29 lead. The crowd was as loud as it had been all night and there was a tangible sense that an upset was looming.
But Oregon, led by quarterback Darron Thomas and spry running back LaMichael James, went on a 24-0 run to end the game. For as well as USC seemed to play at times, the end result was not much different than last year’s 47-20 blowout in Eugene, Ore.
Player of the game: James. The 5-foot-9, 185-pound Oregon running back really is as good as advertised.
James finished with 239 yards and three touchdowns on 36 carries. As the Ducks started to pull away in the second half, James began to wear down the Trojan defense on the same play over and over again, the zone read.
“He’s fast man, he’s a good back,” senior cornerback Shareece Wright said. “He’s stays low and he gets up the field.”
Oregon coach Chip Kelly put into words what seemed apparent on the field in the second half:
“[James] gets stronger as the game goes along,” he said.
Turning point: Down 29-17 at halftime, the Trojans came out fired up and scored two touchdowns and a two-point conversion within the first four minutes of the third quarter.
But the Ducks stayed calm, zeroed in and started to tire out the Trojans as they have done to opponents all season. Thomas led the Ducks to two consecutive four minute-plus touchdown drives, which seemed to take the air out of the once-raucous Coliseum crowd.
Meanwhile, what offensive rhythm the Trojans had earlier in the third quarter quickly evaporated.
“We were in a rhythm,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said. “And for whatever reason we went out of it, then we went back in it, and then we went out of it. It wasn’t consistent.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin called his team’s offense “terrible.” The Trojans finished with 377 yards and hurt themselves by going only 7-for-18 on third-down conversions.
“Finishing, I think, is what we didn’t do,” Barkley said. 
Truly a blur: The Ducks’ offense was as fast and as efficient as its top-rated tag indicated.
Oregon gained 599 total yards and finished just under its previous season average in points at 55.14. Thomas had as good a game throwing as James did rushing, throwing for 288 yards and four touchdowns with one interception on 19 of 32 passing.
The Ducks ran 83 plays in just 27 minutes and 25 seconds. Although the time of possession was more lopsided in the first half — Oregon had the ball only eight minutes and 49 seconds — Kelly said it was about what a team does in that time, rather than how long it controls the ball.
“[Time of possession] is vitally important,” Kelly said. “But how many plays did we run? Really it’s about the number of snaps you get in.”
The Trojans were doing all they could to keep up with Oregon’s breakneck pace, but like every other challenger that has faced the Ducks this year, they were overwhelmed.
“They’re so fast-paced, they don’t slow down for nothing,” Wright said. “The more they run it, the better they get at it.”
Wright said fatigue must have played a role in the defense’s second-half letdown.
“It had to be,” Wright said. “Either we thought we weren’t tired and tried to be tough guys and stay in the game, but we have to come out when we’re tired.”
Better than last year?: Even though the score ended up being very similar to a year ago, many Trojans insisted that they performed better on Saturday than in last season’s 27-point defeat.
“It was different than last year,” sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard said. “I feel like we played a lot better on defense.”
The Trojans did seem more prepared after having two weeks to scheme for the Ducks’ attack, but whatever progress they made was undone when they yielded big plays. Oregon scored four touchdowns of at least 30 yards or more.

Preparation can only go so far.
Teams can only condition, practice and rest up so much before hitting a wall, and any additional time to focus on an upcoming opponent has marginal benefit.
At that point, out of all the things that are worked on in practice, only one factor remains in deciding the outcome of a game, something that can’t be finely tuned: execution.
As USC faced Oregon on Saturday night, the more-than-ready Trojans weren’t physically fatigued, mentally rattled or morally beaten as the game wore down. The defense kept pace with the high-powered Duck offense, and the offense had all the pieces in place to put points on the board.
They just didn’t execute.
Don’t take it from me; take it straight from the source.
“Everything that we saw on film was what we saw in the game,” redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton said. “I didn’t feel like [Oregon’s speed] was an issue. I feel like everyone was in shape, and everyone was lined up. They just gassed us on a few plays.”
Sophomore safety Jawanza Starling said that it wasn’t the speed of the game that overwhelmed the Trojans.
“The tempo wasn’t anything that we haven’t practiced all week for or anything; it was just missing keys,” he said. “That’s how they get all their big breaks.”
Of course, with roster limitations and several injuries still relevant problems for USC, the team entered Saturday at a slight disadvantage. It was not the case that Oregon had better athletes than USC; rather, when the Trojans made mistakes, the Ducks did not.
And once again, that discrepancy simply boils down to an inexperienced team playing a much more seasoned squad.
Although Chip Kelly has led the Ducks as their coach for only two seasons, he has been with the program as the offensive coordinator for four, and seamlessly took the reigns from former coach Mike Bellotti when he was promoted to the athletic director position.
In doing this, Oregon ensured that it would continue playing football the same way it had been for the last five years. Even with the large turnover the Ducks have had at the quarterback position since 2007, there remained an overall consistency in the way the team was run. If there were any holes in the Ducks’ roster, they could simply fill the spot with a player that had grown with the team and knew the system like the back of his hand.
In the past, the Trojans had this luxury. They always seemed to have sufficient depth and recruiting to avoid inexperience, and they certainly had consistent coaching.
But with all of the shakeups the program has withstood in the last year and the major coaching and schematic changes the team has gone through, USC is too full of fresh faces to stay on the level it was once at.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, this ugly truth became blatantly apparent on Saturday.
Let’s make this clear: USC still has some of the most talented players in the nation. But the fact that the Trojans have not had a consistent maturation process within the program has left the team disoriented and often times desperate. A cohesive, flawless system — even if it is run by weaker players — will trump a raw, unstable, young team almost every time.
The Trojans do not need faster players or more conditioning. They need time and stability. If Kiffin and his assistants stay in Southern California and continue to focus on helping their ranks grow up and learn how to fit into the current system, it’s only a matter of time before the budding talent they have develops back into a national contender.
But until then, teams like Oregon will continue to remind the Trojans that they are currently rebuilding, not reloading.

USC knew what was coming.
The Trojans studied the Oregon up-tempo, dynamic, spread offense for two weeks. They conditioned to be ready for the fourth quarter. They practiced tackling.
But they still couldn’t stop the Ducks.

No. 1 Oregon (8-0, 5-0) ended the game with 24 unanswered points to defeat the Trojans 53-32. The Ducks capitalized on three turnovers from a Trojan offense that couldn’t find its rhythm throughout the game.
“We did a terrible job on third down and gave the ball back way too many times,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I think our defense at times played well enough to win, but I thought our offense was terrible today, and obviously that starts with myself.”
The Trojans (5-3, 2-3) started the second half on a 15-0 run as junior defensive tackle Jurrell Casey’s interception and senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson’s 55-yard punt return set USC up for two quick scores. Yet, after explosive games against California and Stanford, the offense stalled after taking a 32-29 lead in the third quarter as sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley never looked entirely comfortable in the pocket.
Catch up · Running back LaMichael James scores on a 42-yard run early in the second quarter to put the Ducks up 15-10. Despite holding a 32-29 lead in the third quarter, the Trojans were overpowered 53-32 by the relentless Ducks, who scored 24 unanswered points to close out the game. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
“It wasn’t consistent,” Barkley said. “We needed four quarters of solid football and it seems like only the first quarter, and the start of the third quarter where we were rocking and the stadium was in it. Finishing was what we didn’t do at the end of the first half and end of the second half and you can’t win when you don’t do that.”
Despite the 21-point defeat, USC was still in the game at the start of the fourth quarter. The Trojans had the ball on the Ducks 36-yard line and were driving for a touchdown that would’ve gotten them within four points.
The drive ended when a shotgun pitch to senior fullback Stanley Havili went for a loss of four yards on third and five and the subsequent fourth-down pass completion came up short.
Those two plays after a strong drive personified the Jekyll and Hyde game the Trojan offense played.
“We were in the four-down range, we were hoping to run and get some yards and unfortunately we lost three or four yards,” Kiffin said. “Obviously it wasn’t a very good call under field pressure.”
Although USC’s offense got caught in a ditch, Oregon’s offense continued to show the speed that’s been its trademark this year. Multiple Trojan defensive players said that fatigue wasn’t a big issue because of the increased conditioning workouts in the past two weeks, but that it was missed assignments and players not sticking in their position that did them in.
“They didn’t run a lot of plays, they just ran the same plays to perfection and we had too many breakdowns as a defense,” senior cornerback Shareece Wright said. “There’s times when we didn’t break down and they didn’t have a chance against us, and times we did and they capitalized on it.”
Even if Oregon ran only a few plays with variations, it worked. Running back LaMichael James ran 36 times for 239 yards and three touchdowns while quarterback Darron Thomas went 19-for-32 for 288 yards and four touchdowns.
“I thought it had the feeling like we couldn’t even breathe out there,” Kiffin said. “It was so fast we couldn’t even get lined up.”
Oregon took advantage of blown coverage multiple times to find wide open receivers, mostly Jeff Maehl who had eight catches for 145 yards and three touchdowns, down the middle of the field.
“We had blown coverage on the first touchdown and on the second touchdown we blew the coverage,” Wright said.
Spotty coverage isn’t going to beat the No. 1 team in the nation, and Saturday’s game showed that to beat Oregon, teams need to play nearly perfect football.
“They’re flawless,” Barkley said.

College students sometimes get a bad reputation for being freebie whores. USC might be half-jokingly referred to as the University of Spoiled Children, but that does not mean that students don’t have their scrimping moments, especially after storming through a big blowout sale at The Grove.
The free samples at Yogurtland are nice, but visiting too often draws unwanted recognition from employees. Chasing after events that offer free food can be fun for a while, but is ultimately too time-consuming, and you might be forced to listen to boring speeches while getting your slice of pizza. So what is a broke college student to do?
The first logical thing is to pin down where most of your money is going. Unsurprisingly, college students spends a majority of their money on food. After all, studying and partying is hard work, and it requires calories.
But calories can be cheap, tasty and nutritious, which means Del Taco’s 39-cent taco is not included. Here are just a few ways to cut corners in the kitchen — without feeling deprived.
Eat beans — Not canned, Mostly vegetarian.
Your muscles won’t atrophy from a few meatless meals. Going vegetarian at least two to three days a week can significantly help your budget, while leaving you energized from the vast array of nutrients in protein-rich food such as beans and legumes.
Tofu might be hard to swallow for a proud carnivore, but beans are found in all the familiar comfort dishes, including chili, burritos and enchiladas, so they’re familiar territory. With liberal seasonings and spices, beans can be delicious and savory enough to make a satisfying meal.
Canned beans might seem economical compared to chicken breast, but it’s still a far cry from cooking your own dried beans. A 15-ounce can of beans costs about $1.50. A pound of dried beans costs roughly the same, yet it makes about 10 more serving.
Most dried-bean packages include stovetop cooking directions, but if you’ve got a rice cooker, just soak and cook the beans as you would rice.
But don’t go overboard, and remember to soak well — beans can be hard on the digestive tract, giving off too many unsavory fumes and leaving you friendless for the day.
Stretch out that rotisserie chicken.
This might seem contradictory to the point above, but buying a whole rotisserie chicken can be surprisingly economical. Superior Grocers sells a good-sized, whole-roasted chicken in the prepared foods section for just $4.99.
Dig in primal-style while it’s still hot and pick out the leftover meat for sandwiches, wraps and stews for the rest of the week, so that you can pack your own lunch or fix it in a snap instead of paying $6 for a salad. Meanwhile, save the bones to make your own chicken stock, which will make at least seven times more than a can of Swanson’s broth.
Make your own instant coffee.
Some students leap out of bed at 6 a.m. every day, run several miles and then bounce off to school — but they’re a small minority.
Most likely, you’re one of those bleary-eyed Trojans trudging to class with a venti coffee in hand or queuing up at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. As the day warms up, you might pop by again for a shaken tea latte.
Just two cups of franchise coffee a day and your habit is already raking up more than $200 per month — more than a week of groceries.
Students savvy enough to own their own coffee brewers still find dissatisfaction with their home-made coffee. Somehow, the taste just doesn’t measure up to a strong-brewed cup at Starbucks, or you don’t have time to make coffee in the morning. Starbucks VIA coffee fixes up a good cup in a pinch, but it is still pricey.
Make your own coffee concentrate that’s ready for hot-brewed or iced coffee in seconds. Take a pound of medium ground coffee and pour 10 cups of cold water over. Leave it to soak overnight, then strain it in the morning and you’ve got your instant caffeine fix that tastes as smooth and dark as those brewed fresh at coffee shops.
To make hot coffee, just add hot water to taste. For a cold glass, add ice, water and milk or half-and-half. Why not dress it up with a drop of vanilla, almond or coconut extract? Some chocolate syrup and a dusting of cinnamon powder and you’ve got a cup of gourmet coffee creation for less than a buck.
Stock up on oatmeal
Oatmeal is one of those pantry items that will last as long as a McDonald’s Happy Meal, so buy in bulk. Not only is it extremely cheap at about $2.50 for a 42-ounce canister of rolled oatmeal, it is fast, easy and deliciously versatile.
Skip the instant pre-flavored oatmeal packets. Making oatmeal from scratch takes no more than 10 minutes and a blank canvas allows wider range of choices and creativity.
As a rule of thumb, you need twice the amount of liquid as oatmeal, but that liquid can be water, milk, juice or broth. A pinch of salt, and you’ve got an open canvas to create whatever you’re in the mood for.
For a sweet route, try it cooked in milk, with a splash of vanilla extract, cinnamon and fruits, such as mashed banana or apples. Sprinkle with some brown sugar and fun toppings such as nuts, peanut butter, nutella, coconut flakes or chocolate chips.
If you crave a more substantial dinner, cook the oatmeal in broth or water and mix in some baby spinach, a drizzle of soy sauce or sesame oil, and top it with a runny egg, perhaps even with a slice or two of ripe avocado. Bacon bits can’t hurt either.
Just because we’re college students doesn’t mean we have to spend all of our money on a good meal. With a bit of ingenuity, a delicious and cheap meal is easy to make.
Sophia Lee is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. Her column, “That’s What She Ate,” runs Mondays.
“Take a pound of medium ground coffee and pour 10 cups of cold water over. Leave it to soak overnight, then strain it in the morning and you’ve got your instant caffeine fix that tastes as smooth and dark as those brewed fresh at coffee shops.”
another faster way is to add hot water to a cup that has a 50cent packet of gourmet healthy coffee and stir and enjoy. i have been saving tons of money and feeling better than ever. I am always looking to sample out my new brand, so ask me if you want.
also, this brand has removed some cravings that you refer to here. :)
be blessed.

It won’t change the outcome of the game, but USC fans can take some solace knowing the Pac-10 conference investigated the clock management during the team’s 37-35 loss at Stanford.
Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott confirmed yesterday that he addressed errors made by the clock operator, who worked for the Cardinal. USC coach Lane Kiffin complained to conference officials about several questionable calls, including the clock operator’s decision not to start the clock after the Trojans picked up a first down late in the game.
“The clock is supposed to start,” Kiffin said. “We huddled up to take our time.  We were even faking audibles. They never started the clock.”
After USC went ahead by one point, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck drove his team down the field for the game-winning field goal.
“There were absolutely mistakes made,” Scott said. “We’ve dealt with it with the school.”
Scott said game officials were also investigated for not making the clock operator start the clock.
The conference recently hired Mike Pereira, former vice president of officiating for the NFL, as an adviser to help improve officiating in the conference.
“I view officiating as a critically important function,” Scott said.

Suspense. Gore. Three dimensions. Saw 3D has all the makings of a great horror film — all except originality.
In the Saw franchise’s seventh and supposedly final film, audiences are left with more of the same, as the complexity and goriness of the traps take priority over a solid and original story line, making the series’ latest addition more of an homage to the previous six than a new chapter.
Saw 3D follows Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a self-help guru who is promoting a book he wrote about his supposed encounter with the infamous Jigsaw killer. Bobby is revealed to be a liar and is caught and put in a very intricate trap constructed by former police officer and Jigsaw apprentice Mark Hoffman.
Bobby wakes up in a cage hanging from the ceiling of an abandoned hospital and realizes that he has been put in an actual Jigsaw trap. He begins a path set forth for him by Hoffman, intended to drastically improve Bobby’s lying character by forcing him to try and save the lives of those closest to him, who have all been placed in less complex traps of their own.
Game time, again · Saw 3D features another round of sadistic traps courtesy of a new Jigsaw killer (Costas Mandylor) who decides to put a phoney survivor (Sean Patrick Flanery) through the real deal. - Photos courtesy of Lionsgate, design by Laurel Van Patten | Daily Trojan  
This idea seems all too familiar, as it is very similar to the plot of Saw III, where a man seeking vengeance for his son’s death wakes up in a meatpacking plant and is forced to try to rescue different accomplices in his son’s demise, all of whom are also in Jigsaw traps.
One thing that Saw 3D lacks is the same thing that the last three Saw films have lacked: the chilling performance of Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. Though his character has technically been in all seven films, Jigsaw was killed in Saw III, diminishing his appearances to only flashbacks.
Hoffman is played by Costas Mandylor, replacing Bell and his character as the new leading psychopath for the thriller series. Viewers accept that Mandylor’s character must be an emotionless madman, but the actor’s performance simply makes Hoffman come off as apathetic and dull.
While Bobby goes on his horrifying journey, Hoffman is also stalking Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), Jigsaw’s widow and the woman who tried to kill him in the end of Saw VI. He also begins to lead Detective Matt Gibson (Chad Donella) on a wild goose chase in hopes of distracting him and his duty to keep Tuck in witness protection.
Both Bobby and Gibson have their fair share of dramatic scenes, but the casting of unfamiliar actors and a regrettable use of stereotypical “slasher dialogue” simply make these attempts at drama laughable.
If that weren’t enough, a poorly timed use of heavy metal background music makes these scenes even more confusing for viewers trying to decide whether to take the actors’ dramatic attempts seriously.
By far the most impressive part of this film was the performances of characters caught in Jigsaw traps. On Bobby’s twisted journey to find his girlfriend and survive, he encounters several people trapped by Jigsaw, all of whom played a part in his undeserved rise to fame.
In classic Saw fashion, each trap is gorier and more terrifying than the last. But what keeps viewers’ eyes glued open and stuck to the screen is the pure terror that the characters are experiencing.
Though some deaths are a little repetitive — one can only witness so many deaths by buzz saws and bear traps before they lose appeal — some of the new Jigsaw traps of Saw 3D are so gruesomely realistic the viewer almost feels guilty for watching.
Pointless scenes of gore can only take a movie so far. Though the film is filled with terrifying death scenes, it lacks the very thing that drew Saw fans to the franchise to begin with: a purpose.
The original Jigsaw chose his victims by finding people who did not value their lives and showed them the error of their ways by putting them in deadly situations. In contrast, this most recent film is much more concerned with body count than a solid plot.
One thing that fans of the series can be grateful for is that this final chapter ties together most of the major loose ends from the past six film, bringing the story full circle.
Though viewers who have not seen the previous chapters might be lost in some of the backstory, they can still be sufficiently entertained by the suspense and terror of the film.
What Saw 3D lacks in originality, it more than makes up for it in gore, scares and even some laughs. Though this film might not be winning any Oscars, it is a thoroughly exciting and enjoyable horror film and a proper homage to the Saw franchise.

Fugitive bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri — who is believed to have built devices for two previous attempted attacks — is believed to have created the explosives placed on U.S.-bound planes on Friday, according to senior U.S. officials.
Two powerful explosives were sent as cargo from Yemen on Friday, and were addressed to locations “associated with synagogues” in Chicago, officials said, and are believed to have been designed to blow up the airplanes carrying them.
The forensic analysis of the two packages, which continued print cartridges containing explosives, showed that that were constructed by the fugitive Saudi bomb maker, who is a member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to John O. Brennan, the White House senior counter-terrorism adviser.
Brennan also said that any more packages carrying explosives en route and Yemen would be checked.

The new Gareth Edwards film Monsters follows a classically mismatched young couple as the two hack their way through the wilds of Mexico toward the United States, certain that sanctuary waits across the border.
Photo courtesy of Magnolia Pictures
If that doesn’t get your social undertone meter throbbing, then the rest of picture, which sees our protagonists evading tentacled, condominium-sized extraterrestrials, will not make much sense.
For the rest of us, and those who have yearned to see what would gestate if Terrence Malick ever tackled Godzilla, the ensuing sights are curiously compelling.
A space capsule full of extraterrestrial DNA has crash-landed in Mexico, transforming the country into a mutated preserve and no doubt supplanting the Mediochan Cartel as its most formidable danger.
As a precaution, the Americans have constructed an enormous wall to keep the beasts at bay, while the rest of Central America seems to have crumbled into chaos and apocalyptic premonitions.
There, specifically in Costa Rica, is where we meet the film’s alpha male, Andrew (Scoot McNairy), a predictably cynical photojournalist who takes pride in his smug understanding that a picture of a child slaughtered by an alien will yield more money than shooting the alien itself.
Although it’s clear that Andrew would prefer to hang around San Jose to turn his narcissism into negatives, he is ruefully stuck with escorting his boss’s adult daughter, Samantha (Whitney Able), to a coastal ship bound for the States.
The journey, which Edwards captures with the unsaturated authenticity of any BBC documentarian, is surprisingly involving.
Well before the titular creatures turn up, Edwards follows Andrew and Samantha as they travel across lonely green hills, where the air of death lurks implicitly. Their train is forced to turn back because of an unspecified disturbance ahead and Edwards evokes a shiver, not simply because we know what that disturbance is, but because we also cannot visualize it yet.
What eventually lands the two in quarantined Mexico is a series of clerical errors à la any domestic flight from New York to Oakland, but Edwards is keener on finding ways for his boy and girl to realize their affection for one another.
It’s a noble aim, but the chemistry between Andrew and Samantha feels synthetic, driven more by the goal of making a different kind of creature feature than by developing unique characters.
Andrew’s archetype was more enjoyable when he was played by James Woods in Salvador, where his emotional detachment was complemented by an unabashed hunger for hedonism.
Samantha fares even worse, with her well-acted scenes of shrewdly negotiating with Mexican civilians for shelter and transportation undercut by her pouting announcements every time she has to tinkle, as though prompting Andrew to erect a canopy of boughs and wait.
And yet, in spite of these shortfalls, there is something genuinely alive within Monsters, lurking in the whispering jungles and impenetrable rivers that weave through the film. This menace is unnerving enough that when the aliens do make an occasional appearance, their presence is almost disappointing.
Edwards’ film is at its scariest in moments of near silence, with the ruined countryside occasionally punctuated by the shock of seeing a rusted fishing trawler resting in the limbs of a tree or a downed fighter jet inching its way through the water, propelled by something unseen.
Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that the film’s most startling scene involves a fellow American refugee and the violent sounds that come from her mouth when Samantha offers assistance, breaking the film’s deafening silence.
The aliens are beautiful, somewhere between giant squids and IKEA lamps, gliding over the deserts and jungles with grace seldom seen outside a Waterhouse painting and only baring their fangs when prompted by firearms and the humans that wield them.
Edwards, whose work as a special effects artist is used sparingly well here, is interested in a more conditioned monstrosity, one that manifests itself in the ruins that occasionally dot the landscape, both modern and Mayan.
Even the endless wall that wraps around the United States is a cold nod to actual constructions, like the wall along the West Bank. What Edwards aims for is less allegory than reflection, hidden beneath the hollow promise of slithering carnage.
The film’s heavy-handed title hammers this home gratuitously, but, nonetheless, the images and ambitions conjured by Edwards redeem his inadequacies as a writer. If Irvin Kerhsner could overcome George Lucas’ stilted dialogue with operatic duels, noir-ish photography and Kermit the Frog’s gout-ridden grandfather, then we should expect the same trick from anyone.
Here we have the first glimpse of a promising filmmaker, whose youth and impressive scope are boons to an interesting future — that is, if we have not managed to massacre each other by then.

California’s state budget process is in shambles. Our legislature was more than 100 days late in passing the budget for the 2010-2011 fiscal year and, as a result, was forced to take drastic measures to narrow a nearly $19-billion deficit.
The state is already struggling just to find the money to function, and Proposition 22, which would further restrict the state’s ability to handle funds, would only make an efficient budget more difficult to achieve.
In the official summary of the proposition prepared by the attorney general, Proposition 22 “prohibits the state, even during a period of severe fiscal hardship, from delaying the distribution of tax revenues for transportation, redevelopment, or local government projects and services.”
Essentially, the state government would be prohibited from borrowing funds generally allotted for local governments, redevelopment agencies and transportation projects.
With the current budget issues facing California, the state has been borrowing money from transportation funds to use in the state general fund.
Transportation funds are placed in separate accounts than the general fund, and Proposition 22 would restrict the state from shifting money into the general fund.
The state government would no longer be able to borrow or change the distribution of state fuel tax revenues and vehicle license fee revenues, redirect redevelopment agency property taxes to any other local government or temporarily shift property taxes from cities and counties to schools.
Although this might seem like a good idea at first, such a policy would ultimately cripple the state’s ability to provide proper funding for essential services.
According to the official California voter information guide, passing Proposition 22 would  reduce resources available for the state general fund by nearly $1 billion in 2010-2011, and a comparable increase in funding would go to state and local transportation programs and local redevelopment.
Proposition 22 is asking us to prioritize where we want our money to go while the state struggles to balance its budget. Passing it would elevate projects such as local construction over public education funding.
Supporters of Proposition 22 say that its passage will aid public services. But that in turn would come at the expense of any of a number of other programs — and our tax dollars should be committed to schools, public safety and health care, not redevelopment agencies and private contractors.
These transportation and redevelopment projects might be important for local government politicians to try to gain favor in their own districts, but restricting access to those funds would leave the state government with even more of a budget problem than it already has.
According to the No on Proposition 22 campaign, if the proposition passes, public schools would lose about $400 million each year. Education funding has already been steadily declining — Proposition 22 would only leave the state with fewer options.
California would have to take actions such as borrowing more from private markets, cutting expenses or raising taxes in order to close the funding gap it would likely face as a result of Proposition 22. Such actions would only leave the state in even more of a predicament than it is in now.
Although it is in no way desirable to have the state government in such a financial pretzel that it is forced to redirect funds and borrow money, desperate times do call for desperate measures. Proposition 22 would tie the state’s hands without addressing the budgetary problems at the root of the crisis.
Eliminating the government’s ability to temporarily divert funds toward the most pressing issues only puts unnecessary restrictions on the actions of the state whenever immediate action needs to be taken.
The state government does not raid the tax dollars of local governments on a consistent basis; it only temporarily moves funds when extra money is needed elsewhere.
Rather than completely prohibiting the state government from taking such action, it would make more sense to place additional regulations on the process.
Proposition 22 would simply leave a government that already has trouble funding its necessities with even less resources to do so.
Jared Servantez is a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism.
The party in control of the state OVERSPENDS and then tries to cover its mistakes by “borrowing” from cities and counties and restricted funds. Like the teen that “borrows” from his buddy without asking, it is just WRONG. Local services should not suffer from mistakes made in Sacramento.
Jared, the state SHOULD struggle to balance the budget.  They should not be given additional funds meant for another specific purpose to help fill the hole they themselves created by expanding government the way they have over the past 15 years.
Prop 22 prevents the law makers from stealing money meant for other purposes.  The amount of gas-tax money alone the people of California pay every year should be dedicated for certain purposes not redirected to the black hole we call our legislature. 
Did you know that there are about 240,000 state workers but the population of California is well over 35 million?  For all the non-state workers how many of them do you think are affected by a late budget passing?  The answer is very, very few.  For the majority of the people in California a budget passed on time or late won’t affect them.  The one aspect of state government that affects the majority of California’s is the taxes they have to pay every year.
Get your head out of the clouds Jared and stop thinking the law makers are only doing what’s right for Californians.  They are out for one thing…themselves.

A week after NPR commentator Juan Williams was unjustly fired for airing his opinion on Fox News, the public is up in arms. Conservative pundits are howling for the organization’s federal funding to be cut — something they would consider a moral victory, though NPR would likely take it in stride.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Williams, a senior news analyst for NPR and a frequent contributor to Fox News, was dismissed from his contract on Oct. 20 for comments he made on The O’Reilly Factor a few days prior.
In a conversation about the “crippling” effects of political correctness, Williams told O’Reilly, “When I get on a plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried.”
Williams was already known for his somewhat unchecked views; NPR’s ombudsman, Alicia Shepard, wrote in her public editor’s blog that “Williams tends to speak one way on NPR and another on Fox. … The assets that make Williams valuable to NPR are his knowledge, his perspective and that he is rarely predictable.”
Williams’ remarks were “inconsistent with [NPR’s] editorial standards,” said David Folkenflik, NPR’s media correspondent, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.
The controversy continued to make headlines this week as Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.)announced plans to introduce a bill in Congress to legislate NPR out of its federal funding.
This is not the first time that conservative politicians have proposed taking an axe to NPR, and it will surely not be the last. Every few years, a group of Republicans work their collective panties into a bunch about the government funding news media that takes a liberal slant.
As Los Angeles Times reporter Jonah Goldberg wrote in an Oct. 26 article, “I have no huge problem with funding documentaries about bears and mummies, but state-run television news is an embarrassment in the age of C-SPAN and YouTube.”
As ridiculous at it seems to kick commentators to the curb for essentially doing their job, it is far more outrageous to cut the funding of a system that produces quality programs, especially considering who the cuts would actually hurt.
NPR is a largely self-sufficient entity. Only 2 percent of its yearly $161.8 million budget comes from federal grants; the majority of the budget comes from program fees and station dues.
In contrast, roughly 10 percent of affiliate station budgets — local radio stations that produce their own content in addition to broadcasting NPR programs — comes from federal money. Of course, these stations had nothing to do with William’s dismissal, but would be far more penalized by the proposed budget cuts.
The impetus for this whole debate was a commentator with admittedly polarizing views — and who, in a serendipitous turn of events, just signed a three-year, nearly $2-million contract with Fox News.
NPR has always pursued a balanced view in its reporting, and, according to a 2008 MRI poll, its audience is evenly distributed across the political spectrum.
Of those polled, 27 percent identified themselves as conservative, 26 percent moderate and 34 percent liberal. (The rest didn’t give answers within the poll’s parameters.)
NPR is a news service that serves the American public fairly judiciously. It provides a higher level of debate that is much needed in a time where information flies at us with unintelligible sound and fury. Neither NPR nor the practically insolvent local stations that support it should be punished for doing their jobs.
We shouldn’t be denying local news sources of direly needed cashflow or the public of a cogent news service.
Lucy Mueller is a senior majoring in cinema-televison production and managing editor for the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Everything is Copy,” runs Mondays.
“This is not the first time that conservative politicians have proposed taking an axe to NPR, and it will surely not be the last. Every few years, a group of Republicans work their collective panties into a bunch about the government funding news media that takes a liberal slant.”
Interesting statement for an editor who is trying to be “objective”. Let me ask you a question. What would you say if a group of Republicans worked their collective panties into a bunch trying to get government to provide funding for FOX news? Please speak freely and honestly while you can.
With an annual deficit of $1.3 trillion for 2010, we can’t afford NPR anymore. In fact we will need to eliminate MANY government programs to get back to the horrific deficits of $200 billion planned for by the last four presidents.
In addition to the author’s obvious ignorance of NPR’s extremely partisan political slant, I’m also appalled at the rhetoric that we propose to “punish” NPR by “denying… direly needed cashflow”. Like many young, stupid liberals, Mueller believes that anyone who wants your money, has a right to it. It is not the corrupt, incompetent political hack demanding a piece of your money, but the ordinary American who expects nothing other than what they’ve earned, who is cast as the villain here. This is in line with the philosophy that calls tax cuts “giveaways”, the belief that the people who take from others are morally superior, and the ones who are exploited should be grateful for what they’re allowed to keep.
If NPR’s shameless propagandism is such a well-produced, audience-pleasing product, why can’t they turn a profit? Let’s cut them loose, and see if they can provide a service worth the cost.
I agree with Carol. This article is HILARIOUS.
Lucy, my dear, NPR has NEVER pursued a balanced view in its reporting, and what’s more, the crucially important job that the “fourth estate” is supposed to be doing is completely antithetical to government support. If NPR were spewing right wing opinion all day it would still be wrong for it to be funded by taxpayer money — especially when we can’t AFFORD to be funding it. Quite frankly, it’s a disgrace all around.
Also, Lucy, as “managing editor” of the Daily Trojan, you should be familiar with the journalistic concept of doing your research. The crack about Juan Williams being “admitted polarizing” — uh, really? How so? Do you find Nina Totenberg wishing AIDS on a U.S. senator (and his grandchildren!) to be less “admittedly polarizing” than Williams? ‘Cuz that ran on NPR with nary a concern from Vivian Schiller & Co., and ol’ Nina wasn’t even just a “commentator” but supposedly a “journalist.” 
Lucy, when you’re sitting so far Left on the spectrum, I guess NPR does look “fair and balanced.” Your skewed perspective, however, does not make it so.
The article I have just read said “NPR has always pursued a balanced view in its reporting.” Ha, ha, i almost dropped from my chair at my computer, laughing at that pattently false statement. Over the past 10 to 12 years I’ve been fortunate to travel and to drive in several states and Canada. When i am driving through a particulary scenic area, I try to find a station playing classical music, sometimes it is NPR. But, when the talk program comes on, it is almost always (OK, always) a left-leaning talk program. I listen for a few minutes, hear the “left’ slant without any other point of view, and I keep turning the radio dial to find real music. I suspect many other people are turning the dial, too. If a so-called “right wing” radio program is so wrong and offensive and out of step with the “American people”, listeners can just TURN THE DIAL and go to another station, of which there are many on both the AM and FM frequencies, or turn their car’s radio off.

A guest appearance by Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood, Justified) on NBC’s hit show The Office has created lots of buzz on the Internet, sparking rumors that the actor could possibly become a regular cast member.
Olyphant, who has starred in such thrillers as Hitman and The Crazies, made his move to comedy last week when he appeared on The Office, playing Danny Cordray, a charming and attractive paper salesman and rival of Dunder Mifflin.
Olyphant said he felt honored to hear that the show’s producers wanted him to be a part of their show, especially since he does not have much experience in comedic acting.
“They’re all so funny,” Olyphant said in an interview. “Really, I’m just so genuinely flattered that they’d have me and give me an opportunity to do something that’s really so different than just about anything I’ve done.”
In an Oct. 21 episode titled “The Sting,” Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell) creates a sting operation in which Meredith, one of his employees, poses as the CEO of a made-up company in hopes that Danny Cordray (Olyphant) would try to sell her paper, thus revealing his secrets to being the best salesman.  In classic Office fashion the sting is awkwardly revealed and an embarrassed Michael Scott makes Cordray a sales pitch of his own, asking Cordray to work for him.
With Carell having already announced that this would be his last season on the show, and Olyphant’s character apparently taking a full-time job at Dunder Mifflin, viewers could not help but head to the Internet and discuss possibilities of Olyphant joining The Office for good and possibly replacing Steve Carell. When Olyphant appeared on the Oct. 28 episode as well, rumors continued to fly.
Though fans might love to see Olyphant join the show full-time, he already has his own starring role on FX’s Justified, meaning it’s probably best for viewers to look elsewhere for a Michael Scott replacement.
I thought Timothy was not given enough air time and a badly written part. But as Raylan Givens on Justified, he is Emmy worthy and a pure joy to watch. So look elsewhere, please. He has a great gig on FX.
