The Women of Troy have come out the gates swinging this season, starting out 3-0 for the first time since the 1998-1999 season. But USC will be faced with its toughest challenge yet as the squad takes on No. 20 ranked Oklahoma State Friday night.
The Cowgirls (6-0) are also undefeated after opening with a relatively easy nonconference schedule this far, meaning both teams will lay it all on the line to maintain their pristine records.
A win for USC would also break Oklahoma State’s 28-game winning streak in non-conference matchups at home.
Home court advantage does not just apply to the Cowgirls. USC senior forward Desiree Bradley is a native of Oklahoma City, just an hour’s drive away from Oklahoma State’s campus in Stillwater, and hopes to come up big in her homecoming game.
Bradley and her teammates will have to rally to pull out yet another win on the road, were they’ve already triumphed twice this season. The Women of Troy will have to utilize all of their weapons and be dominant on both ends of the court to upset the Cowgirls.
The Women of Troy will rely heavily on the momentum they have gained from the nail-biting win over SDSU last week — especially afer making several errors that nearly caused them to blow a 20-point lead.
“Moving forward we have to play for 40 minutes,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said.
Junior guard Ariya Crook will have to show up to Gallagher-Iba Arena locked and loaded, ready to pace the offense and unleash clutch 3-point shots at any time. After a big game (18 points) for the young guard against SDSU, Cooper-Dyke said she’s expecting a breakout year from Crook.
“I am constantly challenging Ariya to never be satisfied,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Her challenge has been accepted. Crook said she is putting in all the hours to make sure her and her team make it back to the NCAA Tournament after a four-year absence under former coach Michael Cooper.
“I am following her footsteps because she knows the road I need to take to get to the next level,” Crook said.
In preparation for this week’s matchup, Cooper-Dyke said earlier in the week that she is challenging her entire team to maintain a high level of intensity.
“Strength and conditioning has been a focal point,” Cooper-Dyke said.
The team has also been focused on reducing the amount of turnovers and fouls. The Women of Troy committed 17 turnovers and 24 team fouls against the San Diego State Aztecs.
Though the Women of Troy’s frontcourt looked solid in their last contest, they will have quite the task trying to contain OSU’s junior Lashawn Jones. The 6-foot-3 center has scored in double digits for three consecutive games, and is averaging 11.5 points this season.
Jones and the Cowgirls are continuing to build off the success they had last season. In 2012, the team made it to the second round of the NCAA Tournament as a No. 7 seed before falling to No. 2-seeded Duke 68-59.
The last time USC played OSU was way back in 1986, before either teams’ players were even born. This will be a great test for the Women of Troy and will prove if the team can hang with one of the top programs in women’s college basketball.
After the matchup against OSU, the Women of Troy will only have two days to recover and prepare for Monday’s tipoff against South Carolina at the Galen Center.

With only four games to go and the NCAA tournament right around the bend, the USC women’s volleyball team is approaching a two-week stretch that might define a season that once held so much promise.
Diggin’ it · Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio (right) leads USC in both kills per set (3.42) and points per set (4.45) this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy (22-5, 12-4 Pac-12) are now effectively out of the running for the  conference championship but the team is still in position to earn a top seed in the NCAA tournament. They are third in the conference behind Washington (15-2) and Stanford (14-3) but are currently ranked No. 8 nationally and will hold the tiebreaker against the Cardinal should the two schools have the same conference record at season’s end.
USC might have been in a much better position in the conference had last week’s road trip gone better, but the Women of Troy suffered two critical defeats at the hands of No. 3 Washington and unranked Washington State, one of the conference’s worst teams. The trip marked the first time all season the Women of Troy have endured back-to-back losses.
“After those losses it’s all about figuring out who we are,” junior setter Hayley Crone said. “Actually, we don’t have much time to figure this out. We just have to move on really quickly and move on for the rest of the season.”
In order for USC to win out they must win four tough games, starting this weekend at home against Arizona and Arizona State and concluding next weekend against Pac-12 spoiler Colorado and crosstown rival UCLA. All of the teams on the docket for USC still have NCAA Tournament hopes and will be gunning to take down the Women of Troy, still considered to be one of the top teams in the nation.
The good news for the Women of Troy? All four of the remaining games will be played in the city of Los Angeles — three in the Galen Center and one right down the 10 freeway in Westwood. The bad news? One of those two losses came last weekend to a Washington State team that is currently second-to-last in the conference standings, and the loss in the fifth set came after USC held a 14-8 lead at match point.
Though head coach Mick Haley certainly wasn’t pleased with the weekend sweep in Washington, his message to his team all season has been to learn quickly from losses and move on. That mindset holds especially strong now, as the Women of Troy must endure a dogfight to earn a favorable seed in the NCAA tournament.
“I don’t think we have any choice about whether to recover,” Haley said. “We only have four more matches and then the tournament starts. We’ve put ourselves in a bad situation and we don’t want to make it worse.”
The biggest question mark at this point in the year is likely the younger side of the squad. While the talent of stars such as freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu and sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio is unquestionable, their experience in pressure-filled situations — especially in tournament play — is minimal at best.
“It’s tough on them,” Haley said of his younger players finishing off a long season. “We have three freshmen and a sophomore in vital roles and it’s very difficult; they’ve not ever been through anything like this … It’s a severe challenge for them. I think they’ll get it, but when you’re going through it, it feels like a lot of weight on your shoulders.”
The first test for USC this weekend will be the Arizona Wildcats (19-9, 9-7), a team that snapped an 11-match winning streak for the Women of Troy back on Oct. 20. The Wildcats currently stand fifth in the conference and are attempting to claw their way toward a berth in the NCAA tournament.
Sunday’s challenge will come against the Sun Devils of Arizona State (17-11, 6-10), a squad that was nationally ranked when they last faced USC but have since endured a rough stretch and dropped to ninth in the Pac-12 standings.
Friday’s match against the Wildcats will begin at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center, and Sunday’s match against the Sun Devils will start at 11 a.m. at Galen Center. Sunday’s match will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

The USC men’s basketball team had a well-rounded performance to keep first-year head coach Andy Enfield undefeated at the Galen Center, as the Trojans beat West Alabama 73-57 on Thursday.
Junior guard Byron Wesley led the Trojans (4-1) with 15 points on 6-of-15 shooting, eight rebounds, and four assists. Freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic had the best performance of his young career, finishing with 14 points and six rebounds. Senior center Omar Oraby controlled the paint with 13 points, eight rebounds, and three blocks, while senior guard Pe’Shon Howard chipped in eight points, six assists and five rebounds.
Despite the well-rounded performance, players felt that there was room for improvement.
“We have to work on protecting our homecourt,” Oraby said. “We can’t let a team come and beat us on our home floor.”
Desmond Raymond led the Tigers (1-3) with 18 points and four rebounds, while Sandy Underwood finished with 16 points and six rebounds.
Before the game, coach Andy Enfield announced that senior guard J.T. Terrell would be ineligible for the first semester due to academic reasons. Terrell could be eligible to return to the team when fall semester finals end on Dec. 18. Terrell was averaging 10 points per game in three games for USC this season, leading the team with 20 in their opener against Utah State.
Oraby towered at least five inches over each West Alabama player, a height advantage that the Trojans exploited, using him to either get an easy shot in the paint or draw defenders to get an open shot outside. His presence helped USC get on an 11-2 run to start the game.
The Trojans would go up by as many as 13, but UWA responded with a 12-3 run to cut the deficit to 22-18. USC opened the game up from there, building up a 45-25 lead at halftime behind nine points each from Wesley, Jovanovic and Oraby.
“The first half, like the other night, we came out with a defensive fire,” Enfield said. “We were in the passing lanes, we were really active with our hands, and we got out to a 20-point lead just like the other night. It was a very successful first half.”
USC shot 48 percent in the first half compared to UWA’s 31 percent. The Trojans were dangerous from downtown, hitting five of their 10 three-point attempts in the half. They also outrebounded the Tigers 27-19, with Wesley leading the team with 5.
The Trojans held their advantage in the second half, constantly rotating their players in and out. West Alabama cut the halftime deficit to as low as eight thanks to a barrage of 3s, but the early hole was too deep to get out of. USC went on an 11-1 run toward the end of the game, ending any chance of a Tigers comeback.
“I was a little disappointed in the second half,” Enfield said. “We lost our focus at times and gave too many transition baskets away by fumbling the ball or missing easy shots.”
USC finished shooting 43 percent for the game, compared to 34 percent for the Tigers. They ran into trouble with turnovers, committing 13 to UWA’s nine, but held their rebounding edge 42-30.
The Trojans will travel to the Bahamas next week for the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament. They will face Villanova in Paradise Valley on Nov. 28 at 10 a.m., followed by a match against either Kansas or Wake Forest on Nov. 29 in Nassau.
USC’s next home game will be against Boston College on Sunday, Dec. 8 at 4 p.m.

I could word this a little nicer, but I’m just going to be blunt. Colorado is really bad.
The Buffaloes’ 4-6 overall record is deceptive, implying that maybe they’re halfway decent, but their conference record tells the real story. At 1-6 in Pac-12 play, Colorado can at least claim not to be the goat of the conference. The Cal Golden Bears own that dubious title after losing to the Buffs to fall to 1-10 overall and 0-8 in the Pac-12 on the season. But that doesn’t mean that Colorado really belongs in the Pac-12. Of those seven losses, Colorado has not been within three touchdowns of a single opponent, with a 45-23 point loss at UCLA serving as the team’s closest final score in the loss column.
So I’m having trouble quantifying the significance of USC’s matchup against Colorado tomorrow. At 22.5 favorites, it shouldn’t take too much to go right for USC to come home from Boulder with a comfortable victory. In fact, even 22.5 points sounds conservative given Colorado’s struggles in the conference, making my decision to pick USC in our Best Bets section on page 10 really easy (and I’m only one correct call behind co-sports editor Nick Selbe in the year-round pool, so I’ve been thinking really hard about all my picks this week). In a conference where it seems like anyone could beat anyone else on any given week — see Washington State and Stanford games as proof — I feel like exceptions can be made for Colorado and Cal, who really look like JV teams, to be honest.
But stranger things in the sports world have happened. Our modern day rivalry with Stanford started when the Cardinal won in the Coliseum as a 41-point underdog in 2007, so the Trojans can’t overlook this week’s game. The crosstown showdown against UCLA will only match the excitement of the Stanford game if the Trojans build on last week’s momentum rather than let it all slip away with a less-than-stellar effort against Colorado.
As a son of two Trojans born in Los Angeles and raised during the pinnacle of the Pete Carroll era, I grew up a huge ’SC football fan. And I couldn’t stand half of the UCLA fans I went to middle school with.
Sure, we matured to the point where we could have intellectual discussions about a matchup without it turning into a shouting match, and now I can honesty say I really respect UCLA as both an athletic program and an academic institution. But I remember participating in extremely heated USC vs. UCLA discussions with some of my classmates in my younger years, which shifted to vicious Facebook comment wars once social media was getting started between seventh an eighth grade.
I had it pretty easy growing up with that rivalry. We basically won every year on the football field. Now, Jim Mora has the UCLA program looking like a legitimate Pac-12 contender for the long run, making the Nov. 30 matchup against the Bruins a brand new kind of exhilarating.
Trojan football finally feels like the team I grew up rooting for. USC finally feels like a football school, not just a party school after experiencing the student section firsthand on Homecoming. It was a feeling I remembered experiencing when deciding to come to USC, but felt I was missing the first three months of my college experience. Even if USC’s recent run doesn’t add up to a Rose Bowl, the pride alone from winning these rivalry games would make 2013 feel like a successful season.
But it’s still not for another week. I wish all the energy — and students — that flowed onto the field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum last Saturday could just carry straight into what also feels like the biggest game of USC’s season next week. But there’s still an important game the Trojans need to win on the road before thinking about the raucous student section the team will come home to over Thanksgiving break.

The USC men’s water polo team ended their regular season with a heartbreaking loss to crosstown rival UCLA.
Letdown · Senior driver Nikola Vavic has accomplished many things in his USC career, but couldn’t help the Trojans gut out a victory over UCLA. – Corey Marquitti | Daily Trojan
 
In a game extremely reminiscent of last year’s national championship game, the rivalry game could not be decided in regulation, and extra play was necessary.
The back-and-forth affair ended with a Bruin goal in the second overtime, and UCLA celebrated a 10-9 victory in Westwood.
The game could not have been more critical for both sides, with major Mountain Pacific Sports Federation implications on the line for both schools. In the end, however, UCLA’s home pool advantage proved to be too much for a Trojan squad that’s hit a rough patch as of late by losing three out of its last six matches.
USC entered the matchup ranked fourth in the nation, but will almost certainly lose that spot and drop to the latter half of the top 10, an extremely unfamiliar spot for the national champions of the last five years.
“A home crowd makes a huge difference,” redshirt junior driver Zach Lucas said when discussing the advantages of playing in friendly territory.
Adding to the pressure of the game was the national attention it received. USC is used to having some of their water polo games broadcast on local stations or, if it’s a big game, the Pac-12 Networks. But the game against the Bruins was shown on ESPN’s college channel, ESPNU.
The Bruins also had the added incentive of playing their last home game for a highly decorated senior class that is thirsty to take the MPSF crown away from the Trojans.
“They were going all out,” Lucas added.
Any loss to UCLA, or any other team for that matter, hurts tremendously, but a loss this close to NCAA tournament time makes the Trojans’ quest for a sixth straight national championship that much more difficult. Their seeding will take a huge hit, forcing them into tougher games early on.
Their only hope for a sixth straight top seed in the NCAA Tournament will come from winning the MPSF tournament next week in Stockton, Calif., since the Trojans will be no higher than a No. 4 seed in the conference bracket. The matchups have yet to be determined, but USC will play its first tournament game on Friday, Nov. 29.

No. 23 USC travels to Boulder, Colo. riding its biggest wave of momentum of the season after pulling off an upset over then-No. 5 Stanford. In the days leading up to the team’s matchup with Colorado, two distractions have been identified as potentially detrimental to the players’ focus — the possibility of a letdown after the big win, and the sub-30 degree temperature that is expected at kickoff.
Breakout · Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler had arguably the best game of his young career against Stanford last week, throwing for 288 yards and a touchdown against one of the nation’s toughest defenses. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Players and coaches have insisted, though, that they are focused on the task at hand and are not prepared to let outside influences affect their approach to the game.
“[The cold weather] is what it is,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “Whatever it is, it doesn’t matter. No matter who we play, where we play, it’s about us and what we can control. Whatever it is, Saturday night, come 7:30 [p.m. Mountain Standard Time], we’re gonna be ready to go.”
With a roster littered with players from Southern California, not many have played in a cold environment like the one that is expected on Saturday. Those who haven’t insist that the elements will most likely have the same effect on both teams.
“I’ve never played in anything that cold, so I really couldn’t even tell you,” redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw said. “There’s probably disadvantages for both teams — maybe they can’t throw the ball as well. Maybe they have to rely on their run game a little more.”
Many have labeled Colorado as an obvious “trap game” due to the fact that the Buffaloes are in last place in the Pac-12 South and the Trojans’ win last week might lead to a lack of focus. But after being upset earlier in the season by Washington State, the players insist that they’ve learned from past mistakes and that their attention is squarely on the Buffaloes.
“[The WSU loss] still bothers me a little bit, but it’s on to the next week,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “After taking that loss, guys have responded well. It’s always about how you respond to adversity. I’m proud of my team.”
Colorado’s main weapon is wide receiver Paul Richardson, a Los Angeles native and high school teammate of USC junior wide receivers Marqise Lee and George Farmer, as well as former receiver Robert Woods. Richardson has caught 71 passes this season with nine touchdowns. His 1,201 receiving yards are the fifth-most in the country.
“He’s a great receiver,” Shaw said. “I know him from high school and worked out with him a little bit this offseason, so he knows me and I know him. It’ll be a great battle.”
The USC secondary, which was heavily criticized at times this season, particularly after the loss to Arizona State, has responded well since then and has done a good job at limiting opponents’ passing attack. USC ranks third in the Pac-12 in pass efficiency defense and has intercepted opposing quarterbacks 15 times, the third-highest mark in the conference.
The Trojans’ defense as a whole has improved drastically in defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s first season, ranking in the top 25 nationally in nearly every category. USC ranks second in the Pac-12 in total defense this season, allowing just 338.8 yards per game, a vast improvement from last season when the team ranked seventh in the conference in that category with 394 yards allowed per game.
“Everybody’s just believing in what Coach [Pendergast] is teaching us, with technique, fundamentals and everything that he preaches,” Bailey said. “Guys are getting put in the right spots and taking advantage of their opportunities.”
Colorado quarterback Sefo Liufau, a freshman who had his redshirt lifted midway through the season, has developed good chemistry with Richardson and the rest of the Buffaloes’ offensive weapons. Liufau has completed 63.4 percent of his passes for 1,350 yards and eight touchdowns in six games this season.
The USC offense will once again be led by redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, who is coming off of his best game of the season against Stanford, a performance that led to him being named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.
The Stanford game was a continuation of a hot streak for the first-year starter, who has completed 71.9 percent of his passes for 935 yards, five touchdowns and only one interception in his past four games, which have all been USC wins.
Kessler’s streak has coincided with the Trojans’ inspired play since Orgeron took over, which has led to a growing amount of support for Orgeron to be named USC’s permanent head coach at the end of the season.
Athletic Director Pat Haden  told Los Angeles’ KFWB earlier this week that he had received a flood of e-mails from “Coach O” supporters.
“I counted them, actually,” Haden said. “I had 136 pro-Coach O emails today. Those were just emails. That doesn’t count the tweets, letters and phone calls.”
Though many players have also voiced their endorsement of Orgeron, they are not letting the speculation detract from their responsibilities for the rest of the season.
“That’s over my head,” Bailey said of the coaching decision. “We know we’ve got him for three more games, and we’re gonna give everything we’ve got for him these last three games that he’s guaranteed to be here.”

On Thursday night, Impact, the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism’s award-winning television news magazine, held a screening of its 75th episode. Impact began producing 30-minute episodes in 2002 under the guidance of professional documentarian and professor Dan Birman.
Thursday’s episode, the first of the academic year, takes an in-depth look at people facing adversity and difficult life decisions. It will also serve as Impact’s submission for this year’s College Television Awards. The first piece follows BARK, a nonprofit organization that uses therapy dogs in schools to ease children’s fears of learning to read.
The second full-length piece visits a CrossFit gym near Skid Row that helps everyone from a blind man to children at risk of obesity exercise in less conventional ways that are more conducive to individual needs. The final piece told the story of a young transgender man and an older transgender woman and takes a look at their decisions to undergo identity changes.
Undergraduate students in Birman’s nonfiction television class — which focuses on documentary and long-form storytelling — produced all of the full-length pieces in this year’s screening.
“I like this show because students decided to take on stories of heart and compassion,” Birman said. “When you look at what it takes for transgender people, that’s a very serious story. This is a story that goes in-depth into the lives of two people and for undergraduate students or any student to invest the time to get to know these people and get to know something about their lives, that’s pretty darn cool.”
Each Impact episode also includes a “short” three to four-minute segment. This episode’s short chronicles the story of the Hollywood Zombie Walk and was produced by a student in Birman’s graduate documentary production class.
To create each episode, the five-member team of journalism graduate students at Impact collaborated with Birman and line producers Megan Chao and Lee Warner to select stories that demonstrate a unified theme and fit concisely in the final product. The team added various elements including teasers, a host to introduce each piece and music.
In past years, graduate students interested in Impact had to make it a yearlong commitment. Because the graduate program will be reduced to one year, starting next fall, the structure of Impact will also change. Supervising producer Grace Lim, however, said having two years on the team was beneficial as a student.
“I’m still a student, too, but taking on that role as a manager and being able to do coordinate with faculty — being that liaison has been a really great learning experience” Kim said.
This year’s Impact team had its share of technical difficulties, such as when the edited version of the CrossFit story disappeared and the teams had to begin again with the raw footage.
“To this day we don’t understand what happened to it,” senior producer and second-year graduate student Kaysie Ellingson said. “It was really heartbreaking to come in and figure out we couldn’t find it but luckily we still had all the raw footage.”
Layne Kaplan, who earned her undergraduate degree in broadcast and digital journalism from Annenberg in 2013, was part of the original team that created the CrossFit documentary in Birman’s class. Kaplan came to the screening with one of her fellow group members, Annenberg senior Nick Burton, and said she was pleased with the final piece but noticed many of the changes that were made.
“It’s your piece and it’s your baby so you get very attached to it,” Kaplan said. “You understand why changes were made but sometimes it’s hard to realize.”
Lauren Spencer, a senior majoring in communication, said she was unsure what to expect when she came to the training, but was surprised at how much she enjoyed it. Spencer added that she might want to get involved with some of the causes discussed in the episode.
“There were some cool organizations, and I loved the segment about dogs,” Spencer said. “They’re there and they support the students. I think it’s awesome and I have an emotional support animal myself — he’s my little therapy animal — so that really touched me.”
Birman said pulling at heartstrings and making a difference is part of what makes Impact a unique long-form journalism opportunity for students.
“If you look at our episodes, we’re searching for stories with heart that answer big questions and take hard looks at things,” Birman said. “There are very few subjects we haven’t covered and every year students come up with news ideas to pitch and work really hard to make them happen.”

The Volunteer Center is partnering with the Salvation Army to collect clothes for donation during their “Clothes for Cupcakes” charity event.
Giving back · Tiffany Chu, a junior majoring in gerontology, receives a cupcake from Cindy Le, the lead coordinator of “Clothes for Cupcakes,” for donating a t-shirt on Trousdale Parkway on Thursday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The Volunteer Center is working specifically in conjunction with a special branch of the Salvation Army called the Haven, a group at the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Healthcare Center that specializes in veteran rehabilitation and reintegration. The Haven also provides individualized job search and training opportunities to homeless veterans looking for employment.
At the end of the Haven’s job training program, the veterans receive a set of interview clothes and a wallet or purse with a small amount of money inside. Students are encouraged to donate dress shirts, pants and blazers to be given to veterans. All other clothing donations will be put with the general Salvation Army inventory.
Students who make donations by Thursday received a ticket redeemable for a free cupcake from Sprinkles Cupcakes or Big Man Cakes on Thursday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in front of Tommy Trojan.
Free 21 Choices frozen yogurt gift cards will be given to students who contribute donations after Thursday.
Joenique Rose, program manager at the Volunteer Center, said the clothing drive is also a way of giving back to the community for the holiday season.
“With the holidays coming, we thought it would be great for USC students to donate any kind of warm clothes, like sweaters and jackets, although any and all items are very much appreciated,” she said.
Rose also said the premise of giving free cupcakes in exchange for clothing donations gives students another reason to participate.
“Everyone likes a little incentive, so we’re hoping that the cupcakes and gift cards will get more students to participate because this whole event is really just trying to get as many donations as we can for the Salvation Army,” Rose said.
Cindy Le, lead coordinator of the project, was excited to bring a clothing drive to USC’s campus.
“We wanted to show them how easy it is to make a difference and to introduce students to the various nonprofit organizations that USC works with,” she said.
Le explained why a clothing drive is a good method of getting students involved in giving back to the community.
“I remember last year packing up all my clothes that I didn’t want and I’m sure other people felt the same,” Le said. “We figured this was something that was really easy for college students to do while addressing a really great cause at the same time.”
Le also said the donation process is a learning opportunity for USC students to find out more about the surrounding community.
“When students come to give donations, we tell them about the Haven and what they do for the community and give a little presentation about the homelessness issue in Los Angeles,” Le said.
Shayna Lurey, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she supports the charity drive and is planning on making a donation this week.
“I think it’s really important as students who are part of a relatively wealthy campus to realize that we’re so fortunate compared to others,” Lurey said. “I think this clothing drive should remind us that we need to give back to our community and those who don’t have nearly as much as we do.”
Michael Harper, a sophomore majoring in popular music, said he thinks USC should continue these charity efforts in the future.
“I really hope this isn’t just a one-time event because it’s easy to just host one charity drive and think that you really made a difference,” he said. “It needs to be an ongoing effort from everyone on campus.”

Five student members of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation lay on the ground under white sheets in Hahn Plaza Thursday afternoon to symbolize 1,100 workers who died in factory fires in Bangladesh in the last year. A banner above the bodies read “1,100 killed, President Nikias End Trojan Deathtraps.”
Making a statement · Members from Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation brought attention to the plight of factory workers. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The group aimed to raise awareness about sweatshop-like labor conditions in unsafe factories in Bangladesh where USC apparel is produced through their “die-in” protest. SCALE hoped to prompt Nikias to amend the code of conduct to ensure that all Trojan apparel brands have signed a legally binding contract that would hold them accountable for unsafe factory violations in Bangladesh.
“I don’t want Trojan apparel to be found in the next factory disaster,” said Chanelle Yang, a SCALE member. “Engineers have said that 90 percent of factories in Bangladesh are structurally unsound. The next disaster could happen at any moment.”
SCALE members handed out fliers and spoke to students about their cause during the die-in.
“I didn’t realize USC apparel was made like this,” said Eva Nofri, a freshman majoring in psychology who witnessed the protest. “It’s kind of horrifying and the protest showed that.”
After the protest, SCALE members went to Nikias’ office to deliver a letter with their demands, where Dept. of Public Safety officers arrived to mediate the situation.
“We don’t know why DPS was there,” Yang said. “We were there silently and peacefully to deliver a piece of paper to the office. We were not any threat to the administration.”
After more than an hour, Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry allowed Julia Wang, the president of SCALE, to speak to the administration. Carry said that the group could schedule a meeting for next semester to discuss the issue with him and bookstore managers.
“We are still going to push to get a meeting with Nikias, who is the sole decision-maker,” Wang said.
This is just the latest in SCALE’s recent attempts to bring attention to the plight of workers. Earlier in October, the group held a candlelight vigil for workers killed in a factory fire and on Oct. 26, the group rallied for worker’s rights.
In 2007, SCALE protesters staged in a similar sit-in at former university President Steven Sample’s office.
“We want them to implement the necessary safety measures,” Yang said. “I wanted to make sure that all Trojan members are treated fairly and working under safe conditions and protect millions of workers’ lives in Bangladesh.”

Program Board’s Concerts Committee announced late Wednesday night that singer Jason Derulo will headline the 10th annual Conquest on Nov. 25.
This year will be the 10th annual Conquest, an event that takes place prior to USC’s football game against its crosstown rivals the UCLA Bruins. In addition to the performance by Derulo, the event will include a sports rally, a burning of a symbolic “Bruin” and fireworks.
Allie Schmiesing, co-director of the Conquest committee, said Jason Derulo was chosen because he was the one candidate who most people on the committee seemed to agree upon.
“We basically have to maximize our budget to get someone who the most people are going to know and appeal to the most people on campus,” Schmiesing said. “[Derulo] seemed like the best option.”
Schmiesing also said that booking a solo artist made more sense than a band because bands tend to charge more. Despite this, she said she is looking forward to Derulo’s appearance.
“I think he’ll put on a great performance and I’m really excited for Conquest,” Schmiesing said.
Students had mixed reactions to the news that Derulo would be the performer.
Some, like Aleen Mankerian, a sophomore majoring in public relations,  were looking forward to seeing him.
“I’m super excited, I love Jason Derulo,” said Mankerian. “I kind of wish I’d have listened to more Childish Gambino stuff before the concert last year, but I think Conquest is such a great opportunity for students to see artists they may or may not have heard of for free.”
Others, however, were less impressed by the announcement.
“I’m excited for Conquest — it’s always fun — but, to be honest, USC could have picked someone better as the headlining artist,” said Julie Lai, a junior majoring in biological sciences. “They get so much funding, so it’s totally possible, too.”
Others did not believe Derulo would appeal to a lot of USC students.
“I couldn’t care less about Jason Derulo; I’ve barely heard any of his songs. Honestly, I’ve been to better concerts at Occidental College and frankly, only girls really care about Jason Derulo,” said Drew Eller, a junior majoring in business administration and cinematic arts. “I’m not excited. Conquest is kind of underwhelming.”

Approximately 150 athletes, in addition to athletic department staff, teamed up on Thursday afternoon to pack 40,000 meals to send to families in the Philippines who have been affected by the recent hurricane.
Teamwork · On Thursday, student athletes worked together to pack bags of rice for those affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The group, which included members of the lacrosse, swimming and tennis teams, formed 14 assembly lines to efficiently pack rice, lentils, vegetables, Himalayan salt and some other seasonings and vitamins in bags. All supplies were provided by the nonprofit organization Feeding Children Everywhere.
“We were really excited to come over here and give you guys an opportunity to serve. That’s what we want to be about as an organization,” Peter Marshall, Feeding Children Everywhere’s West Coast event coordinator, told the students. “We want to help you guys get involved in service, and not just a place for dollars, but a place for you guys to be engaged and mobilized into serving your community locally and globally.”
Matt Ackels, director of community outreach for the athletic department, said Athletic Director Pat Haden wanted to do something for the Philippines because Wilfred “Fred” Uytengsu, one of department’s major donors, lives and works in the country.
Feeding Children Everywhere had previously done an event with the swim teams in August to pack 10,000 meals for local children. For this event, Ackels turned to the entire athletic department.
“I invited the coaches first and I got six or seven teams saying ‘Yeah, we’ll be there, we want to help out,’” Ackels said. “What really surprised me was just yesterday I emailed the entire athletic department staff and said what we’re doing and over half the staff wrote back saying, ‘I’ll be there.’”
Ackels noted that at least 30 staff members attended the event, including Haden himself.
“[The student athletes] do 3,000 hours of community service a year. … I’m trying to get to as many events as I can,” Haden said. “We’re told that 2 million people are without food [in the Philippines], so we’re just trying to do our part.”
Many student-athletes said they were excited they had the chance to give back.
“It’s just a good opportunity to help them. They’re really suffering right now,” said Annie Ruland, a freshman lacrosse player.
Coaches were also supportive of the event, even allowing athletes to volunteer instead of holding practice for the day.
“This is our 2 p.m. practice for Thursday afternoon,” Chase Bloch, co-captain of the swim team, joked.
Bloch, however, couldn’t resist making the event a competition in itself.
“It gets competitive. [Last time we] broke up into classes — freshmen, sophomore, junior, senior — and [had] a little race,” he said referring to the August event.
This time around, Marshall counted off athletes and assigned them to tables. The tables later raced to see who could fill two boxes of meals the fastest. Though the hour of packing meals was filled with fun, Ackels stressed that overall it was about helping others.
“It’s not, ‘cut us a check or send a couple people out to deliver something,’” he said of packing the meals. “It’s really ‘everybody get here, we’re going to pack this stuff and really have an impact.’”

When the American remake of Oldboy, in theaters next Wednesday, was announced, there was an outcry from film fans. The Korean original is an absolute classic and the prospect of a remake seemed downright ridiculous. This is not an attempt to judge a film before seeing it, but Hollywood does not have a good track record when it comes to remaking foreign films for American audiences. It is something that happens much more often than most people realize and shows no signs of stopping, but it usually begs the question of why the superior originals do not get wider releases instead.
The recent surge of remakes and sequels in the movie industry has been driven in large part by the safer economic prospects of betting on an already popular story as opposed to an untested one. Most of the people voicing these complaints, however, are usually not aware of an entire swath of remakes hidden from most American viewers. These remakes are based on successful foreign films and they are much more prevalent than the average viewer realizes.
A recent trend involves the remaking of Scandinavian films. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a well-known and generally well-received remake, but lesser-known films such as Mark Wahlberg’s Contraband and vampire horror film Let Me In were based on Icelandic and Swedish originals. Even the well-received FX series The Bridge from earlier this year was based on a Swedish and Danish series from 2011. Before the Scandinavian streak, we saw an Asian horror film trend with The Grudge, The Ring and Dark Water. And before that, there was a French comedy marathon in the ’80s and ’90s with The Man With One Red Shoe, Jungle 2 Jungle, and 3 Men and a Baby. These films and television shows mostly found middling success, excluding those Japanese horror remakes in the early 2000s. They also stained the superior originals while giving the original filmmakers barely any recognition for their creations.
The philosophy behind the practice is simple and built upon four ideas. The first two ideas are the reasons for choosing the material. The relative safety of previously successful material is usually preferable to original ideas. These films being remade were all successful in their original countries, often being recognized as international classics. Thus, the material is ripe for picking. Second, these films are usually pretty cheap to remake, as their material is usually unremarkable.
The third and fourth ideas serve to answer a question: Why bother remaking these films at all instead of widely distributing the quality originals? First, studios rightly believe that an English language film will make a much larger profit here in the States versus one in a foreign language, regardless of differences in quality. Furthermore, studios can make more money by remaking a film such as Oldboy as opposed to securing a local distribution license for the original, foreign language film. So, as usual, it comes down to economics.
The strategies used on this subsection of remakes, however, usually undermine the admittedly sound financial reasoning behind the decision to remake. Despite the previous success of the source material abroad, it is usually unknown locally. So, in comparison to the barrage of remakes of American productions that are made, these films are generally underpublicized and seen as fodder put out by the studios. I mean, I don’t know anyone who went to see Contraband.
Even worse is what happens in the translation process. Often the films are not only translated, but adapted to what studios believe will be more successful with American audiences. This usually leads to embarrassing results. For example, Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon’s terrible appearances in Taxi in 2004 and Steve Carrell’s even worse Dinner for Schmucks in 2010 both originated as lovely and sophisticated ’90s French comedies, and ended up as unfunny, almost unwatchable farces.
Nevertheless, Hollywood sometimes gets it right. Though frankly unnecessary, David Fincher’s Dragon Tattoo remake was quite good and Al Pacino won his only Oscar for his role in the Scent of a Woman remake. The zenith of the Hollywood foreign remake category has to be The Departed. The remake of Hong Kong’s Internal Affairs featured a stellar cast and earned Martin Scorsese his long-awaited Academy Award for Best Director on top of the Best Picture Oscar. The irony of it all? These successes are all still arguably inferior to the original products.
The films chosen for this treatment are usually of the upper crust when it comes to quality. These are complex and well-made films by talented directors. The remaking of these films into American copies is frankly more insulting to us as an audience than it is to the creators of the original products. It is an indication that the industry doesn’t think we can handle reading a few subtitles (or, God forbid, listening through an overdubbed film) or understanding a complex plot.
So, despite Spike Lee and Josh Brolin’s involvement in the film and comparatively polished look, you will probably be much better served next Wednesday by reading a few subtitles and watching the absolute classic that is the Korean original instead.

Oldboy is originally a Japanese story. The Korean version is the remake de facto.
I couldn’t agree more with this story’s writer. American filmmakers are talented enough to develop original movies and do not have to resort to remaking foreign classics.  It really doesn’t hurt to read subtitles.  Try it, you might like it.

Though Trojans will compete with Bruins over Thanksgiving weekend in their annual football face-off, there is another showdown taking place off the field: the second annual We Run the City 5K event for Special Olympics Southern California.
Run this city · Runners representing USC and UCLA compete at last year’s We Run This City 5K. The event pits the fundraising efforts of the two rival schools against one another to raise money for the Special Olympics. – Photo courtesy of Special Olympics of Southern California
 
The event, which takes place this Sunday to kick off rivalry week, is a fundraising run and walk that determines which school — UCLA or USC — will “run the city,” while supporting more than 14,000 Special Olympians at the same time.
The 5K’s Manager of Special Events Brandon Tanner said that the run has two major functions.
“The key is not only to raise funds for Special Olympics, but also it is awareness,” Tanner said. “Special Olympics heavily relies on volunteers, and a lot of our volunteers come from the colleges. This event helps get [students] engaged and provides an exposure to Special Olympics that many of them have never had.”
The competition is broken down into three categories: which school registers the most runners as their fans, which school raises the most funds and which school has the first 100 runners to cross the finish line. Each category is weighted evenly, and a school has to win at least two out of three categories to claim victory.
According to the run’s website, it’s a dead heat: USC and UCLA are tied at 50 points apiece. As a result, it will be up to the runners on Sunday — composed of students, alumni, faculty, staff and fans — to determine who will win “bragging rights” and the We Run The City trophy.
Tanner said that the rivalry between the two schools was just an added bonus, as the universities were chosen mostly because of their relevance to the upcoming World Games.
“Both campuses are going to be an integral part of the 2015 World Games, so this event is helping engage the students for that,” Tanner said. “Both schools will be a host to many of the venues for [the Games], as well as will be housing many of the athletes.”
The Special Olympics has worked to spark students’ interest in the event in several ways, including partnering with the recreation department at both campuses, in addition to reaching out directly to students.
“We held a student influencer meeting on both campuses and invited student representatives from some of the larger groups on campus, like Greek life, housing, the volunteer center and student government,” Tanner said. “We’ve also been out to football games for both schools, just doing some tabling.”
The increased recruitment efforts seem to be paying off.
“Last year, we had around 1,000 runners, and we’ve already surpassed that with registrations this year, and we have three days to go and the day of the event,” Tanner said. “We’re hoping to get 1,300 to 1,400 runners out there.”
One new runner that has decided to participate is freshman Deborah Bello, who decided she wanted to sign up after hearing about it from a friend.
“I love getting a workout wherever I can and it’s for a good cause,” Bello said. “Why not try to give money to someone in need?”
Bello said she was also attracted to the event because of the opportunity it presents to get involved with the community.
“I’ve never been able to help the Special Olympics kids in any way, so I think it’s a great way for me to start — just the thought of bringing that to a kid, who may not necessarily have the same ability or chance to try to get into something as amazing as the Special Olympics,” Bello said. “This is the perfect opportunity that I can help them be able to fulfill that dream.”
Bello said that while having the two rivals compete with each other might increase motivation to perform well in the race, she anticipates that the competition will still remain good-natured.
“I feel like there’s definitely going to be some feuding that will be apparent,” she said. “I’m sure the school colors will be everywhere — blue versus red. I think it’ll be a lot of fun. I could also expect a very chill atmosphere before it, but I’m sure that the minute that it starts, everyone is going to get pretty pumped and let that rivalry show.”
Tanner said he hopes for the event to continue in the future, and for the number of participating students to grow. He said the best way to accomplish this is to establish the event as one of the many traditions that go on during rivalry week.
“The reason we have the event on the day it is, is that it’s the Sunday before the USC-UCLA football game,” Tanner said. “Then it’s hosted on the campus where the football game will be hosted. We want to continue that. We want it to become another staple that is happening during that week.”
Looking back at last year’s run, Tanner said that he has no doubt that this year will prove just as successful.
“It was just awesome to see two schools coming together, using their friendly rivalry to help raise funds and awareness for Special Olympics,” he said.
 
We Run the City 5K will take place this Sunday at 9 a.m. at Exposition Park. Registration is $35 per runner, and is open until the day of, as well as provided on-site.
 
Very cool! Will check it out

It’s one of the unfortunate facts of film: sequels are usually worse than their predecessors. The writers responsible usually have trouble continuing the storylines that made the first film so interesting and the same spark just isn’t there. On rare occasion, however, the opposite happens — the creative team from the original film is changed, more resources are funneled into the sequel and all of a sudden, the sequel not only measures up to the original, but actually builds upon it to create something even more impressive. This was certainly the case two weeks ago with the release of Thor: The Dark World, and it seems lightning struck twice with the release of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.
Good looking out · Academy Award winning actress Jennifer Lawrence (right) reprises her role as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson (left) plays love interest Peeta Mellark in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. – Photo courtesy of Murray Close
This sequel sees a new director and a handful of new faces thrown into the mix. Gone is Gary Ross, the director of the original, and gone with him is his overuse of shaky cameras. In his place, we find Francis Lawrence, director of I Am Legend and Constantine. Lawrence signed up to do Catching Fire as well as the next two sequels, Mockingjay — Part 1 and Mockingjay — Part 2 — because, naturally, this being a successful young adult book series, Hollywood is now obligated to split the last book into two films — and has been outspoken about his efforts to maintain a visual continuity both from Ross and through the remaining films. It shows. The best parts of the first film, its visually striking worlds and costumes, are still present here, yet in an expanded state. Lawrence was able to show much more of the opulent capital city in this installment, taking advantage of a very talented creative team to build an even more visually striking aesthetic while also serving the purpose of symbolizing the class inequalities that are so important to the underlying themes of this story.
Sequels that improve upon originals tend to have a pattern. The first film tends to occupy itself with a lot of world building, whereas the second can instead have fun exploring that world or with more action occurring in that already built world. This is especially effective in the more fantastical genres, where the exotic worlds presented require more development. In The Hunger Games, Ross had to occupy himself with exposition. He had to explain the nature of the games. Ross had to introduce the main character Katniss Everdeen, played by the magnetic Jennifer Lawrence, and her conflicting love interests, Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne, played by the diminutive-yet-eager Josh Hutcherson and “brother-to-the-guy-who-plays-Thor” Liam Hemsworth, respectively. Only after accomplishing all that could he focus on the games themselves. So, in a way, Francis Lawrence had an easier task in front of him while making Catching Fire.
Catching Fire’s story picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous film, and proceeds to show us the post-traumatic stress Katniss is experiencing after the games and the political upheaval that her defiant victory has caused throughout the land. The fallout is so great that the government decides she needs to be eliminated. Because of this, and using the guise of it being the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games, the gamemaster announces a special version of the games played only by previous winners from each district. So Katniss finds herself thrust back into the games along with several other skilled players.
The new cast of characters provides an improvement over the first film. The newer roles seem thoughtfully cast, which is to say there weren’t any actors of Jeffrey Wright’s caliber the last time around. They are also joined by Amanda Plummer, of Pulp Fiction Honey Bunny fame, and the talented young actors Sam Claflin and Jena Malone. Philip Seymour Hoffman, still releasing residual manipulative malevolence from his Academy Award-nominated role in 2012’s The Master, is probably the most impressive addition of all as he plays the new game maker, the man pulling the deadly strings behind everything.
It is a testament to the story that a film based on a young adult book series can attract such a talented group of supporting actors, on top of the star-studded supporting cast carrying over from the first film including Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and Donald Sutherland. The actors all have voiced their appreciation for the depth and significance of the themes running through the story. This is no-sparkly-vampires-flying-around-in-the-woods. The story has a strong Orwellian message to it, crying out about the dangers of oppressive government. The presence of such a strong message in the packaging of the visually striking movie Francis Lawrence put together allows The Hunger Games: Catching Fire to climb above the usual bland young adult fare to be one of the best sci-fi films of the year.

On Nov. 5, the China Food and Drug Administration issued a statement proposing that “non-special use” cosmetics will no longer allow animal testing, to go into effect June of next year. It’s a small step, but one that speaks to a larger global movement of animal rights awareness. Animal experimentation should be halted wherever possible, especially in the field of science where they are subjected to such terrible  treatment in the name of a greater good.
Arguably the world’s largest supporter of animal rights, People for the Ethical Treatment  of Animals (PETA) has launched an initiative in conjunction with Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, consisting of 34 countries that have spearheaded the movement to save animals’ lives. PETA crosses international borders, with well-established programs in India and the U.K. The European Union also recently passed legislation to regulate animal experimentation in all 27 of its member countries.
With so many nations taking steps to utilize alternatives to animal testing, the topic of animal experimentation in non-commercial fields arises as well. Science has historically used animal experimentation to both understand existing conditions and phenomena, as well as to test hypotheses, drugs and treatment plans. From psychology experiments to the testing of new vaccines, the study of the body, or the ability to test generational studies on animals that can quickly reproduce, science subjects animals to conditions that are too controversial to test on humans.
Though one would be hard-pressed to find an argument that all animal experimentation should be eliminated, there is plenty of room for improvement. Furthermore, as PETA purports, not all medical and scientific advancements are due to the “sacrifice” made by animals. The fact of the matter is that health conditions are often unable to be replicated accurately in other species.
With the capability to accurately replicate human conditions, it seems reasonable that the possibility of virtual testing is not only more feasible, but perhaps also more fruitful. An abstract concept certainly, the BBC defines virtual testing as essentially “using computers to create virtual cells, tissues and whole organs, growing these components in the laboratory, or using new scanning techniques to peer inside the body.”
And though it would require a huge monetary investment initially, the payoffs would be well worth the cost.
Furthermore, the concept of a computer-generated and modulated experiment makes more sense in the realm of mutation and random variance. Even in fruit flies and mice, genetic variation and environmental differences can account for a significant amount of variation in data results. The beauty of a computer-simulated system would be the possibility of a perfectly controlled experiment. Of more practical significance, the Food and Drug Administration states that 92 percent of drugs tested on animals fail or are defective in humans, anyway — at the end of the day, we have different anatomy.
Ultimately, there might be benefits to animal testing. But current wasteful and ineffective methods lead to few positive results and a lot of unnecessary captivity and loss of life.
 
Arshya Gurbani is a senior majoring in biological sciences.
 
Pampered USC students need to suffer from horrific diseases before making grandiose statements about halting the use of animal testing in the name of science. They need to watch their loved ones eroding away from poxes and ailments that make them truly consider the responsible use of live tissue for research. I am so tired of stupid people claiming animal testing is bad and should be banned but then not even intellectually grasping what that impact means. So easy to continue to live like a dewy-eyed 6 year old even well into your 20’s when Mommy and Daddy constablt took care of whatever your ailments were.

On Tuesday, Nov. 19, former President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush spoke to a select group of USC faculty, trustees, donors and students in Bovard Auditorium.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Those lucky enough to receive an invitation and RSVP in time were admitted to Bovard under specific instructions: no backpacks or large bags — security also requested that laptops be checked — and no heavy coats. In addition, no filming, photography, recording or posting on social media would be allowed. After initially being told that they’d receive press passes, the Daily Trojan, Neon Tommy and Annenberg Television News were informed by e-mail that the event would be closed to all media.
Before the event began, audience members were asked to turn off all electronics. Students sitting in the orchestra section said if security saw members of the audience take one picture they would get a warning, and after a second offense, they would be asked to leave.
This isn’t the first time former, future or potential presidents have tried to keep the media out of their events. In the 2008 presidential election, reporter Mayhill Fowler attended a San Francisco fundraiser for President Barack Obama that was closed to the media. Fowler, who was a member of the Huffington Post’s “Off the Bus” band of citizen journalists and was invited to the fundraiser because she was also an Obama donor, later blogged about the event. The coverage became infamous because of a comment Obama made that “bitter” Pennsylvanians were turning to guns and religion, according to the Daily Beast. The scandal soon became known as “Bittergate.”
Four years later, Republicans made the same mistake. During a $50,000-a-plate fundraiser for Mitt Romney that was closed to the media, a bartender stealthily videotaped the event and leaked footage to the press, according to the Huffington Post. The controversy this time was over Romney’s comment about how 47 percent of Americans feel entitled to services such as health care, food and housing, but pay no income tax.
The Daily Trojan, Neon Tommy and ATVN all covered the event. Similar to how Fowler attended the Obama event as a donor, but covered it as a journalist, students attended through invitations extended to them as scholars or members of clubs, but wrote about it as journalists. ATVN even diverged from their usual broadcast-heavy online presence to do a longer print article because they were not allowed to film the event.
Bush appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno the same day he spoke in Bovard. His discussion with Leno, however, covered less political and controversial topics than his appearance at USC. So, was he willing to say some of the things he did at USC because he didn’t believe they would receive media attention?
If that was Bush’s calculation, it was an ill-advised one. In an era in which being a “journalist” has become less of a career and more of a hobby for many, there is no way to guarantee that any event will truly be private.
Even though most students were respectful of the social media ban in place during the event, as soon as it was over, attendees began tweeting and posting statuses and pictures on Facebook, often including exact quotes they had taken note of during the discussion.
In a country where fifth graders owning smartphones is a common sight, where Wi-Fi is as ubiquitous as cell service and an average of 500 million tweets are sent per day,  events being closed to the media has become an antiquated and obsolete idea.
Bush was president of the United States for eight years. Perhaps more than anyone, he should know that people are always watching. In an auditorium that seats 1,235, it was simply ludicrous for Bush or the Washington Speakers’ Bureau, the company that organized the event, to believe that the event would ever remain truly off the record.
