The youth vote was a major factor in the election of President Barack Obama, but two years into his presidency, it seems he’s losing that support.
A recent AP/mtvU poll showed support for the president is waning among students nationwide. The poll shows he now has an approval rating of 44 percent among college students, down from 60 percent in May 2009.
Of those polled, 27 percent reported being unhappy with his administration, up from 15 percent two years ago.
“Voters aren’t happy with the economy and aren’t happy with high unemployment,” said Katherine Cook, chairwoman of the USC College Republicans. “Many who supported Obama two years ago feel like Obama hasn’t delivered on the hope and change he promised.”
However, the political director of the USC College Democrats, Micah Scheindlin, said Obama’s lagging numbers in the polls is normal.
“Politics is cyclical,” Scheindlin said. “You’re always going to see a president go down in popularity once they actually start governing.”
Expert’s say Obama’s support has decreased because of high unemployment rates, opposition to the economic stimulus and the healthcare overhaul, which might present Republicans with the chance to win back the majority in Congress on Nov. 2.
In an effort to prevent this, the president has hit the campaign trail, stumping on behalf of several Democratic candidates locked in close races. One of these stops will be at USC, where Obama will rally support for incumbent California Sen. Barbara Boxer.
These rallies, many of which are occurring at universities, might help the president, Cook said.
“[Obama’s university visits] may just be the deciding factor in several close Senate elections, and Obama needs all the Democrat seats he can get in order to continue pushing his agenda in Washington,” Cook said.
Though his approval rating is dropping, many USC students said they still support the president.
“People are losing trust in Obama because they want quick results,” said Felix Oje, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering. “It’s because people are looking at where we are right now and attributing that to who’s [in office] now, but [the recession] was bound to happen since four years ago.”
Christopher Pryor, a junior majoring in creative writing, agreed.
“He’s doing a solid job,” Pryor said. “There’s always going to be people who are cynics and people who are advocates.”
Although the economy and high unemployment continues to weigh on students’ minds, many USC students said they were most concerned about Obama’s healthcare reform.
“The healthcare bill surprisingly passed both the House and the Senate,” said Melanie Houselog, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering. “Unless the Republicans manage to take over Congress and change this bill from ever taking effect, I truly believe that Obama has royally screwed over the United States of America.”
She added that her main opposition to the bill included the allocation of money in healthcare and the lack of attention to seniors.
“I really don’t know if Obama won because he had so many candidates blindly following him or because people wanted to be a part of history,” Houselog said.
The insurance mandate will require that each adult American making over $15K per year pay between 8-10% of their yearly salary for the government approved health insurance policy.  Those making between $15-32K (roughtly speaking it’s about 300-400% of the FPL) will have subsidies to help defray part of the cost.  However, for college grads making over $35K a year you’ll have to pay that 8-10% on your own if you’re self-employed or freelancing.  On top of a student loan and rent will you be able to pay that?  Just think at $35000 a year your insurance will cost you over $3500 a year.  Figure rent for an apartment is $1100 a month.  And if you make more you’ll be paying more for the insurance.  Once the bills starting coming in and the student loan payments are due you just might be thinking differently.  We don’t know what’s going to happen but even if this reform morphs into Single Payer expenses and taxes will still go up and you’ll be rethinking things when you can no longer afford an apartment of your own.  I recommend you read the Kaiser Family Foundation reports and check out their calculator to see what a policy might cost in 2014 and what subsidy you might get.
“The recession was already put in place by the Clinton Administration when he put forth the legislation that literally allowed folks to purchase homes they could not afford with those sub-prime mortgages”. 
To be fair and balanced, the Glass/Steagle act was written by a republican, signed by a democrat. Both sides had a hand in the fall….BUT it was the pressure from the liberals who wanted everyone to have a chance on getting home regardless if they could afford it or not that made it possible….imagine that, liberals wanting people to spend more money then they have….lol!! Where have we seen that before? Oh yea…Obama.
“Christopher Pryor, a junior majoring in creative writing, agreed.
“He’s doing a solid job,” Pryor said. “There’s always going to be people who are cynics and people who are advocates.”
hahahhaahhahahaha….Christopher, have you been paying attention? Believe me, once you start working your butt off to make money (if you can get a job that is because companies are afraid to hire anyone becasue they become a HUGE burden to the company thanks to Obama care), You wont be saying he is doing a solid job then. Obama is an unmitigated DISASTER! He governs based on liberal/Socialistic agenda only….USA isnt what it is becasue of govenmental power, just the oppositie, in fact, it was founded on the premise of small govt with less power. Join the real world.
Micah Scheindlin is not very bright–“You’re always going to see a president go down in popularity once they actually start governing.”  Micah, seriously. The president is not a king. Government is the servant, not the master.
Wow, first made boy Pat Haden turns Indymac Bank into the second largest fiasco in US history and then made boy Obama runs the united States of America into the ground. What are you boys going to do now? “We’re going to USC, and then Riordan’s Pantry for some chicken and waffles”. 
When Sparta fell there were 25,000 elite citizens, 550,000 slaves and dozens of made infiltrators. Wake up and smell the….
“If you vote for a candidate that is pushing an extreme form of liberalism (the Progressives) or an extreme form of conservativism (The Christian Right, the Moral Majority, etc) you’re going to get folks in office who are not interested in governing for the best interests of the country. They are only interested in the best interests of their party platform.”
So what’s the pratical solution there Greg?
“I really don’t know if Obama won because he had so many candidates blindly following him or because people wanted to be a part of history” — Whoa, no way, blindly following is what I think of Republicans!! Man, bad choice on interviewing that girl. She clearly has no idea what the key provisions of the health care reform bill were. “Royally screwed?” She’ll be glad decades from now, when she needs Medicare that someone paid attention to the financial and medical needs of our senior citizens. “Obama losing favor with college students” “more young voters lean to the right”…I really wish these articles came with citations.
Obama and his policies suck. 
Attention students!
Just wait until you get the bill for what he’s doing …..
Hope and Change, and transparency in government were key topics of Obama’s candidacy, none of which he has come through on.  Young people can’t remember any of the rules of politics, becasue they’re young.  Politicians, for the most part, will tell you just about anything to get elected, then you hope that they don’t totaly mess everything up.
Catering to special interests, both corporate and citizenry, in order to get re-elected is the main focus of every politician until we have reforms in place to limit carerr politicians in all areas of local, state and federal government.
As for the comment “…[the recession] was bound to happen since four years ago.” is misleading.  The recession was already put in place by the Clinton Administration when he put forth the legislation that literally allowed folks to purchase homes they could not afford with those sub-prime mortgages.  Everyone in the industry, financial and real estate, knew that the boom was going to go bust in due time, hence the hedge funds and other financial instruments that a select few on Wall Street bought that bet against their own company’s interest in purchase bulk home loans, in betting those loans would default, hence the term Credit Default Swap instruments.
The fall of the market started under George Bush’s Administration, and yes, they didn’t do much to realign the market until the last 2 years when it was obvious what was happening, but it wasn’t started by the Dubya Admin.
Young people and those voters who are not historically savvy, nor think on their own, must realize that when a politician tells you something that you “want to hear” it is a smokescreen for gaining your vote, at any cost.
If you vote for a candidate that is pushing an extreme form of liberalism (the Progressives) or an extreme form of conservativism (The Christian Right, the Moral Majority, etc) you’re going to get folks in office who are not interested in governing for the best interests of the country.  They are only interested in the best interests of their party platform.  
We need moderate candidates, with level heads on their shoulders, who want to take this country to new relams of prosperity, not “spread the wealth”, not tell me what to do, how to do it, and when to do it.
Obama and his Illinois politics is destructive to the future of this country.  Remember kids, Barak Hussein Obama, does not have any political experinece.  He was elected to be an IL Sentaor by a fluke.  He was a community organizer.  He is a slick version of that guy running for Governor of NY, the dude representing the “My Rent is too damn high” party.  
Be careful waht you wish for…..  you may not see what is in store for you as young people, but us older folks have been there, done that, and we know that what is being forced upon us by this current Administration is not good for the soul of this country, nor good for our kids, that’s you, and our grandchildren, and not good for the properity of our future.  
The future of our country is really up to you, the folks under the age of 35, as it will be your generation that shapes this country for the future.

Speaking on the same steps as President Gerald Ford and then-presidential candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, President Barack Obama will speak at a political rally in front of Doheny Memorial Library on Friday.
Chiefly visit · President Barack Obama will visit campus on Friday to campaign for California senatorial candidate Barbara Boxer. - Daily Trojan file photo 
The event, organized by the Democratic National Committee, will be hosted by the USC Political Student Assembly, an organization composed of 25 political student groups on campus.
“This is one of the few times that we have a sitting president come to our school,” said Jason Duong, director of the USC Political Student Assembly. “Regardless of your political views … it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity that you can tell your grandkids.”
Assembly members will begin setting up baracades on Thursday, Duong said. They will also help with crowd control and distribution of water bottles during the rally.
Attendees of the rally may being begin entering the event at 10 a.m., and the program is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. Visitors, who are encouraged to take public transit to the campus, should enter on Trousdale Parkway, south of W. 34th Street, where each person entering the rally will be required to walk through a metal detector.
People are not allowed to wait in line for the event overnight.
For security reasons, laptop computers, sharp objects, drink bottles, folding chairs, backpacks, bags and purses larger than a size of standard paper are prohibited.
USC Transportation officials said they are expecting traffic congestion on the streets around campus. Trams will not be allowed to drive on campus. Tram pick-up and drop-offs will take place at the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street; however, these plans might change based on input from the Secret Service, the Department of Public Safety or the Los Angeles Department of Transportation.
To accommodate visitors driving to campus, parking spots in Parking Structures A and X will be reserved. Permit holders who normally park in those structures are advised to park in alternate parking structures, such as Parking Structures B or D.
Campus will be open during regular hours and classes will remain as scheduled, however, several buildings, including the Student Union and Doheny Memorial Library, will be completely closed. In addition, the Von KleinSmid Center, Bovard Administration Building and the Ronald Tutor Campus Center will have partial closures.
The majority of classes will not be affected by the rally. Administrators are working with professors to create alternate class locations for those classes that might be affected because of their proximity to the rally.
Bicycle racks will be temporarily removed from the east and west sides of Trousdale Parkway between 34th Street and Tommy Trojan to accommodate for the expected number of people attending the rally. Bicycles locked on these racks after 5 p.m. on Thursday could be impounded by DPS. Students are also asked to avoid parking bikes on Downey Way, between Trousdale Parkway and Stonier Hall; 34th Street, south of Parking Lot B; and Childs Way, north of the campus center.
More than 7,500 people have already responded to the USC College Democrats Facebook event for Friday’s rally, said Micah Scheindlin, political director for USC College Democrats. About 30,000 are expected, according to the press release.
“We’ve been promoting the event since it became official,” Scheindlin said. The student organization has also been tabling on Trousdale this week and encouraging students to sign pledge-to-vote cards, in an effort to make Obama’s visit resonate with all students.
“We’re hoping that the president’s message goes further than the people who are already enthusiastic,” Scheindlin said. “The president will impress upon everyone else in the crowd and in the country.”

Will the President be speaking at 11 AM or 1:30PM? This article says “the program is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m.” However, the article last week said that he would speak after the lunch fundraisers at 1:30 PM, though it also said that he would speak at McCarthy Quad.

USC Annenberg’s Knight Program in Media and Religion and The Poynter Institute are joining forces to launch an online course on religion coverage.
Although the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism offers students a number of classes focused on religion and journalism, USC Annenberg’s Knight Chair in Media and Religion Diane Winston said this new online course helps improve public understanding about religion and improve reporting on it.
“The e-course isn’t for people who want to be religion reporters. It’s for anyone writing a story where religion is part of the mix,” Winston said. “It’s a quick way to learn about covering religion if you are unfamiliar about the topic.”
Winston said she went to a seminar at The Poynter Institute, where she learned how creative online courses could be used. She then decided that an e-course would be a great way to reach journalists who wanted to know more about covering religion. The Ford Foundation provided a grant to develop resources for this course.
“It is designed for general assignment reporters, independent journalists and others who do not normally cover religion stories,” Winston said.
The course, Religion, Culture and Society: Getting Beyond the Cliches, will be offered for free online. The class will integrate scholarly and informed writing on religion into all areas of news coverage.
Howard Finberg, director of interactive learning at Poynter, said the collaborative initiative for the Knight Program and Poynter’s News University initiative began when Winston approached the organization.
“As we note in the course, religion and politics has become part of almost all coverage areas,” Finberg said. “It is important that journalists [and journalism students] be equipped with the tools to improve their coverage and avoid the clichés.”
Along with editors, producers and reporters, Winston said the course would serve anyone in journalism, including educators, who may want to discuss religion in their journalism classes.
“I’d like all journalism classes to add the e-course to their curriculum,” Winston said. “It’s an easy way for students to see how religion is part of all kinds of stories.”
Winston said the course would allow its students to cover stories about the environment, international relations, sexuality and politics — among other topics that intertwine with religion.
Becca Louisell, a senior majoring in print journalism, said she is looking forward to the new course.
“I don’t think there is a clear separation of religion and state, so not covering religion is ignoring a central part of the fabric of the American society,” Louisell said.
Winston said the collaboration with Poynter would serve as a valuable resource.
“The Poynter Institute provides continuing education for journalists and journalism education. It’s the gold standard for teaching the art and craft of journalism,” she said.
Winston said she believed the two working together would provide great content in a cutting edge package. She said she hopes to get additional funding for more courses.
“Recently, the Pew Forum released a survey showing that many Americans are ignorant about religion. Reporters are no different,” Winston said. “We could do specialized courses on Islam or on Christianity. We also could do courses on topics such as covering religion and science or religion and politics.”

A new chapter has joined the fraternities of the Interfraternity Council this fall, and members say they are hoping to get their presence on campus known.
Phi Sigma Kappa had a chapter at USC before, until it was kicked out for disciplinary reasons in 2003, according to current Phi Sig President Mike Fritschner.
Fritschner said he was contacted by national chapter members about becoming the founding president of the new USC chapter.
“I know there’s a small chance that restarting a fraternity could fail, but I love knowing that it’s all on us to make it what we want it to be,” Fritschner said. “We can’t point fingers at the people who came before us because it’s all on us.”
Phi Sig is conducting informal recruitment this fall and will be able to extend bids throughout the semester. So far, the fraternity has recruited 45 members.
“I just saw this huge opportunity to meet a great bunch of guys and have an experience that few people have had to start a new frat on a huge campus like USC,” Fritschner said.
Currently, the fraternity is recognized by its national chapter as a first stone colony, or a fraternity in the founding steps. USC and the Interfraternity Council have recognized Phi Sig as a full fraternity.
Fritschner said IFC has been very receptive of the new fraternity, and it has participated in IFC meetings.
“They treat us like we’ve been a fraternity here for 20 years,” he said.
Demetrius Wallace, the regional leadership coordinator for West Coast chapters of Phi Sig, helped restart the chapter through talks with the university and outreach to students.
“[It’s] under my guidance and some other alumni, but they have the chance to make it their own and establish traditions that will be here 40 years later,” Wallace said. “I really want them to be the best they can be and a top fraternity on the campus in the next couple of years.”
According to Wallace, Fritschner was chosen as president because he had a strong ability to connect with college students and demonstrated his goals through a letter of intent.
Matthew Redhead, the vice president of brotherhood for Phi Sig, said creating a new fraternity chapter allows the founding brothers to shape the history and character of the organization.
“For the chance to [not] do things you don’t necessarily agree with — [like] how other fraternities go about their business — is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” Redhead said.
So far, Redhead said, fraternity members have begun to bond and form connections.
“We definitely already have a pretty strong connection. We party together, we hang out together and get along with each other really well, surprisingly,” he said.
The fraternity hopes to continue increasing its presence on campus, especially among Panhellenic Council sororities, Fritschner said. It will also focus on philanthropy events in November.
“The national frat’s philanthropy is Special Olympics, so we’ve contacted them,” he said. “Or we might help at a soup kitchen a few blocks away from USC.”
Fritschner said the fraternity hopes to get a house on The Row  eventually.
The next group of founding fathers for the organization will be key in creating the fraternity’s legacy, Redhead said.
“[We’re] gonna be picky about it. We want the people who are going to buy into what we’re doing and the presence we want to make,” Redhead said.

Everyone knows it. The state of California is a mess. Voters can’t decide if they want to legalize same-sex marriage, pot or both; the only news I hear about Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown comes from slanderous negative advertisements; and it has rained for the last week. I forget what the sun looks like.
Ready to launch · Senior goalie Madison Aguirre throws the ball after making a stop. USC President C.L. Max Nikias said last week that women’s lacrosse will be added as a Division I sport, an announcement coming on the heels of Cal’s decision to cut five varsity sports because of funding issues. - Photo courtesy of women’s lacrosse  
Oh yeah, then there’s that $20-billion state budget deficit. Unfortunately, the Governator can’t force Dez Bryant to pick up that tab.
Like the wrath of swine flu, nothing is immune from the budget shortfall, including collegiate athletics at public institutions. This deficit has been, directly or indirectly, the cause of a few events in the past month that signal a power shift in athletics from public to private universities in California.
This became apparent last month when Cal cut five varsity sports, including baseball, women’s lacrosse and the most successful men’s rugby program in the country, which has won 25 national championships since 1980.
The cuts will reduce the university’s financial commitment to sports from $12 million to $5 million by 2014, but that is only a sliver of the $150-million deficit the university reported last year.
In the wake of this news, USC decided to add women’s lacrosse as a Division I sport. USC President C.L. Max Nikias told Annenberg TV News last week that the formal announcement will come in a few months.
“We are in the process of recruiting the coach for the team and then we will make the announcement,” Nikias said. “Lacrosse is becoming very popular. It’s more popular in the East Coast, but now it is becoming more and more popular in the West Coast.”
But Nikias didn’t stop there. He said that after a women’s team is added, more Division I sports could be coming.
“I wanted to give priority to the women lacrosse [players] and then in the next three to five years I think we are going to be in a position to also introduce a men’s lacrosse team,” Nikias said.
The juxtaposition could not be more clear. Public universities are reeling from this deficit. They are struggling to maintain their rich academic tradition while keeping the cash cow — the athletic department — alive.
When a conflict rises between academics and athletics, almost every time academics win out. This year, UC Davis eliminated four out of its 27 sports as it struggled to stop the bleeding caused by the budget deficit. It’s sad that it has come down to slashing the universities’ pride and joy, but when Cal cuts its men’s rugby team, you know the situation is dire.
Conversely, private schools aren’t affected as much by the budget crises as public universities are. The state funded 22 percent of Cal’s budget last year as opposed to 40 percent just 10 years ago, and Cal Chancellor Robert Birgeneau said the university can’t go much lower than that. However, that number is still much higher than what private schools rely on from the state — nothing.
On the other hand,  private schools are able to survive in this economy because of higher tuition — the in-state tuition cost at Cal rose above $10,000 this year for the first time — and strong endowments.
That money transfers over to athletics. With public universities cutting sports, many athletes will look to the private schools for a more stable program. The women planning to play lacrosse for Cal’s team, which finished third in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation last year, might look to play at USC instead. The same is true with the school’s baseball players.
The catch is that, with limited scholarships, some of the Californian athletes that have flourished on public university sports teams in years past with minimal scholarships or even as walk-ons might not be able to afford the tuition of a Stanford or USC. Talented players that made a career because they could afford the four-digit tuition at Cal might never make it to such a high collegiate level these days, which is the biggest disappointment of all.
Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t an “I go to USC so USC is better” column. Far from it. But it’s undeniable; as the two recent moves show, private California universities such as USC and Stanford will start to suffocate public schools in athletics if the budget shortfall continues because they will be able to better fund their athletic departments.
Cal became the first high-profile school in California to cut high-profile programs. Where will it end?

USC continued its breakneck pace at practice Tuesday as it prepares to face top-ranked Oregon on Oct. 30.
Unstoppable · Senior wide receiver David Ausberry said that even though USC, which averages almost 38 points per game, has upped the pace at practice this week, the team should play that way every week. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Ducks score more points faster than anyone in the nation, meaning the Trojan offense must continue its stellar play if USC is to keep up.
USC averages almost 38 points per game, not as eye-popping as Oregon’s 54.3 but still impressive.
If USC can hold Oregon to around 35 points, it could be good enough to give the Trojans a shot. But senior wide receiver David Ausberry said he’s not approaching the game that way.
“It’s important every week to play like that,” Ausberry said. “We’ve got playmakers and we got great coaches so they’ll put the ball in the guys’ hands that need to make plays.”
Only against Virginia, when the Trojans put up just 17 points in an ugly win, has the USC offense looked out of sync. That is a major contrast to last year when the unit was often inconsistent, especially against Arizona State and Arizona.
The key, according to Ausberry, has been staying away from injuries, or at least recovering from them faster.
“Guys are a lot healthier this year,” he said. “We still have certain injuries, but I feel like guys are coming off injuries a lot quicker.”
u
Freshman tailback Dillon Baxter is one of those players that has been sidelined. Baxter sprained toes on his left foot against Stanford and did not play against Cal.
Baxter missed practice again Wednesday, but he said his condition is improving. It is only the big toe that is hindering him now.
“I’m going to try to practice [Thursday],” Baxter said, adding that he would definitely practice next week and is on pace to play against the Ducks.
Cal was the first game the tailback has missed and his first real injury of any sort, he said.
“It sucks. No one wants to be hurt but you can’t do anything but rehab,” Baxter said.
—
The Trojans will likely enter next Saturday’s game unranked, while the Ducks, if they take care of business against UCLA Thursday night, will probably remain the No. 1 team in the AP poll.
That is unfamiliar ground for a USC team accustomed to being top dog and fending off attacks from other teams trying to knock them off.
But Ausberry, who was part of  top-ranked Trojan teams earlier in his career, said none of that matters.
“We know to play ball regardless,” Ausberry said. “Things I learned from those older guys, being a freshman, [is] you gotta play regardless. Doesn’t matter if it’s No. 1 or No. 100.”

Nikola Vavic is still young.
Dynamic youth · With just five upperclassmen on the USC men’s water polo roster this year, freshman Nikola Vavic played himself into the starting lineup despite catching mononucleosis in June. Vavic now leads the team with 29 goals this season. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Young enough to sport a few leftover pimples from the eighth grade on his forehead; young enough to interject the word “like” between sentences.
The play from the USC men’s water polo team’s freshman driver, however, would indicate otherwise.
So far in 2010, Vavic, who also happens to be the son of head coach Jovan Vavic, leads the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team in scoring with 29 goals.
“I didn’t even know that until Saturday after the [Cal] game,” said the younger Vavic. “I never thought I’d be leading the team, especially not as a freshman.”
But circumstances beyond his control thrust the Loyola High School standout into a starring role.
The Trojans, coming off back-to-back national championships in 2008 and 2009, have been expected to struggle with the departures of nine seniors and a current roster that includes just five upperclassmen — all juniors.
Subsequently, Vavic has seized the opportunity to become a starter, despite his lack of experience on the collegiate level.
“It just worked out that I had a spot because of everyone who had left,” Vavic said. “I was going to play the same way, no matter who was here, but it did help me stay motivated, seeing that there would be more opportunities to play.”
But actually securing a starting spot would be a stiff challenge with a Trojan roster cluttered with other talented underclassmen.
“We have some good foreigners too, so it wasn’t like I saw a suffering team and would just jump right into it,” Vavic added.
But if anything could unseat the freshman’s attempt to crack the starting unit, it would be an offseason workout schedule that would seriously test his durability and potentially shatter his confidence. Beginning in May and concluding with coach Vavic’s notorious “hell month” in August, players were put through a series of conditioning drills that would otherwise appear borderline insane.
“It was really rough,” Vavic said. “It was much harder than anything I had ever done before.”
To make matters even more challenging, Vavic contracted mononucleosis in early June, just before the team’s three-week break, setting him back in terms of conditioning amid the team’s summer workout program.
“I was just dead,” Vavic said. “I got it before the break, so when we got back, I was just completely exhausted. It was really hard, and I [was] just trying to keep up.”
And while recovering from the illness, Vavic also found himself living at home in the South Bay with his father — the coach.
“It was weird, especially being at home and going back and forth from practices with him,” Vavic said. “That was ridiculous. That was a little too much to handle.”
But eventually, the younger Vavic moved to USC’s campus, recovered from mononucleosis and maneuvered his way into the rotation for the team’s Sept. 4 season opener against Redlands during the UCI Invitational. A day later, Vavic continued his ascent, notching his first hat trick of the season against Whittier College.
But if you’re looking for a defining moment in Vavic’s young but stellar career, then an Oct. 3 matchup with crosstown rival UCLA in the finals of the SoCal Tournament might suffice.
With the score knotted at eight late in the fourth quarter, seasoned junior goalie Joel Dennerley stopped two five-meter penalty shots, giving the offense a chance to take the lead. At the other end, Vavic received a pass from his teammate and roommate, freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie, and found the net with 35 seconds remaining to cement the victory, marking the team’s eighth consecutive SoCal tournament title.
“We were just running a play, and the guy played bad defense,” Vavic said, displaying a touch of modesty. “I got ahead of him a little and just capitalized. I had a clear shot …It just worked out for me. I guess it’s better to be lucky than good.”
But not all of Vavic’s teammates see such a play as simply a stroke of luck.
“He pulled around the player and had the confidence to take the shot with that little time remaining,” said Davie, who is second on the team with 28 goals. “It takes a lot of confidence to take that shot as a freshman.”
Vavic has not let up in the slightest, scoring a combined four goals in the past two games in losses to Stanford and Cal.
“He’s grown up with the coach and grown up with the system, which really helps,” Davie said. “He really goes hard, especially when it comes to attack. He has that fire in his eyes to get the goal.”
Still, Vavic insists he doesn’t feel any pressure. Not as the son of a coach who has won a combined eight national championships on the men’s and women’s circuit. Not as a freshman. Not even as the top scorer on the nation’s top-ranked team.
“There’s really not that much pressure on us — At least, I don’t really feel it,” Vavic said. “We were ranked just fourth at the beginning of the season, and nobody really expects us to win it at all this year.”
But that hasn’t halted any forward thinking, at least on behalf of Vavic, who despite his inexperience, remains confident that the Trojans can “three-peat”, despite the team’s youth.
“I know we’re good enough and have a great shot at winning it all,” he added. “Personally, I’m not too worried. I know, in the end, we’ll come together and we can handle it.”

Recently, bands that were jamming under the radar have been making an abrupt climb into the mainstream. These acts’ meteoric rises have turned them from unknowns to stars in an instant.
Marisa Lorion | Daily Trojan
What was the trick to their sudden success? In some cases, it took a certain song to generate some fame, or perhaps a debut album with huge buzz around it. Instead of changing their styles or pulling off some stunt, these acts simply got the right opportunity and took it.
Among the mainstream risers are bands such as Florence + the Machine, Local Natives and Mumford & Sons.
Florence + the Machine
Florence + the Machine is the stage name for British pop-singer Florence Welch and the band that accompanies her. Welch hails from London and released her debut album Lungs in the UK during the summer of 2009.
Until Welch’s performance at the Video Music Awards on Sept. 12, Florence + the Machine had been surfing amid underground bands, dropping singles and covers as a means of garnering more attention.
Florence + the Machine really landed in the mainstream after Welch’s VMA performance. The show publicly exhibited Welch’s unique, earthy singing style and powerful edge — as further evidenced on Welch’s debut album.
Welch’s rendition of “Dog Days Are Over” was an exquisite mixture of fairy tale costumes and high-energy tribal dancers. Welch and the dancers were choreographed to perfection and Welch’s vocals succeeded in exemplifying the very reason Florence + the Machine was at the VMAs.
The award for Best Art Direction in a video, given to “Dog Days Are Over,” and Welch’s VMA performance of the song undoubtedly played a pivotal role in propelling Florence + the Machine into their newfound success.
After Welch’s VMA recognition, Lungs soared to No. 2 on iTunes’ albums chart, while “Dog Days Are Over” jumped to No. 9 on the singles chart.
Florence + the Machine later released “Heavy in Your Arms” for the soundtrack to Eclipse, the third installment of the Twilight series. Welch is currently in the studio, working on her second album, due out by 2011.
Local Natives
Local Natives has been experiencing a similar breakout year — minus the frenetic VMA buzz.
Although the indie band is based in  Silver Lake, it released its first album Gorilla Manor in the United Kingdom during fall 2009 before it was released the following February in  the United States.
Local Natives is becoming known for its unique use of percussive waves of sound, piano melodies and rich, luscious vocal harmonies, as evident in their hit “Wide Eyes.”
The single is a hypnotic, psychedelic, folk-sounding song that penetrates the eardrums with its heavy percussion but simultaneously evokes the soothing qualities of a lullaby with the underlying chant of the chorus.
“Wide Eyes” has undoubtedly become Local Natives’ most recent and most powerful hit; the sound present in the song is the quintessence of Local Natives’ distinctive tone that has generated positive feedback and appeal.
Local Natives caught the eyes of critics and fans when they opened for Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes in the band’s 2009-2010 tour. Opening for such an indie powerhouse is not an easy task; however, Local Natives were able to pull it off successfully, garnering comparisons to other notable indie bands such as Arcade Fire and Vampire Weekend.
Local Natives’ successful opening gig seemingly opened the eyes of the public and proved that the group was worthy of the spotlight. The band recently headlined a September show at the Music Box in Hollywood and is currently touring the United States and Europe.
Mumford & Sons
Mumford & Sons emerged from London’s folk scene with the production of their debut album Sigh No More in October 2009. Mumford & Sons is an idiosyncratic folk band that couples unique folk instruments — such as the mandolin and banjo — with patriotic-sounding vocal harmonies and rhythms.
Mumford & Sons’ appeal is found in the band’s high energy and enthusiasm during live performances. The musicians themselves are profusely talented and they play their respective instruments with tact and mastery, but also have no problem — and are quite notorious for — switching instruments with each other on stage.
Lead singer Marcus Mumford’s voice resonates deeply, giving Mumford & Sons’ songs a powerful, but paradoxically delicate feel. Winston Marshall serves as the band’s banjo expert and provides upbeat riffs; Ben Lovett plays keyboards and the accordion, giving the songs tonal class; and Ted Dwane supports the lower registers by plucking his gargantuan string bass.
Mumford & Sons have enjoyed moderate success in the United Kingdom, but their musical identity has since skyrocketed as the band has begun touring in the United States and making appearances on talk shows, including the band’s set on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday.
The highlight of Kimmel’s free concert was the song “Little Lion Man,” which got the entire crowd jumping, clapping and stomping in classic hoedown fashion.  Mumford & Sons proved to be energetic, entertaining and modest, warmly accepting the crowd’s applause.
Mumford & Son’s performance on Kimmel and kick off tour in the United States has served as the tentpole for revealing themselves to the public, as their fan base has exploded within the past year and their public profile as exciting musicians continues to grow.
These bands broke into the mainstream suddenly, but they do not look to be fading anytime soon. It was their talent, not gimmicks, that helped to bring the fame, and that’s what will keep them in the spotlight.
[…] With the way the independent music scene works, it’s not unusual for bands to blow up very quickly. However, just because it’s common doesn’t mean that it’s weird to watch. The first time I saw Local Natives, they were playing at a 150-capacity club and seemed shocked that any people actually bothered to show up, much less selling out the place. This time around, they were at a venue ten times that size–which wasn’t packed, but still had a respectable audience. This Cannery show was truly set apart as a completely different experience once I witnessed grown women pointing at the band and saying, “I’m going to marry that one.” It’s a natural enough result of increased success, but I have to say that it still felt pretty strange. I don’t want to be that jerk bragging about liking them first, because Local Natives deserve the best and I’ve certainly been evangelical about them, but I want to say this as a spectator of the buzz game. Also, if you have the opportunity to see Local Natives live, you should take it, because they’re lovely and sound amazing and make you feel good about being alive and able to see great music. Enough of my boring blather, here are some pictures. (But maybe also check out this article.) […]

In the 1930s, David Alfaro Siqueiros’ mural was deemed too controversial.
Photo courtesy of Rachel Shachar 
Now, USC students will embrace the opera that tells his story. As part of a series of shows taking place in Los Angeles, America Tropical will be performed on campus free of charge at Parkside Restaurant on Saturday.
Though the location and free price seem questionable to some, the Chamber Opera of USC hopes to bring life to Siqueiros’ artistic journey and the variegated history of Los Angeles from 1781 to 1992 while exposing opera to students in a welcoming manner.
The show will be performed at Pico House and the Autry National Center with plans  for the performance dating back to as early as last semester.
The Visions and Voices Initiative decided to give the Chamber Opera of USC the rare opportunity to put on America Tropical, the opera whose libretto is written by Oliver Mayer. The organization strives to give undergraduates the chance to perform in shows on campus.
Their $20,000 grant and support from the Autry National Center and Mayer brought to life the plans for the opera directed by Nathan Singh, a 2010 USC alumnus and performed entirely by USC students.
“I knew that this wasn’t a traditional opera and my approach to it is not traditional by any means,” Singh said. “I’m excited to explore a new side of opera, one that is stripped down to just singers on-stage telling their powerful story through movement, working together as ensemble to create the community of L.A.’s past, present and future.”
The title is based on Siqueiros’ powerful mural “La America Tropical,” which was on display on the outside of the Plaza Art Center. With the help of about 20 other painters, the mural was complete in October in the early 1930s. But its contents — mainly the Indian figure crucified in the center — caused controversy and were soon snuffed out with white paint.
Now, Siqueiros’ works are receiving attention as America Tropical continues to bring exposure to his life and works. The opera weaves a story based on actual events and follows Siqueiros’ thoughts before painting his famous mural.
But Siqueiros’ political involvement went beyond simply painting polemical pieces. His political defiance landed him in a sticky situation including house arrest and exile. He was also once involved in a dangerous plan to kill Leon Trotsky.
His controversial story and background show the oftentimes difficult decision that viewers have to make about the work of artists. Should art fans ignore the questionable actions and ethics of Siqueiros in light of his expertise and artistic ability?
For Adrian Rosales, a first-year graduate student studying vocal arts (performance) who will play Siqueiros in the opera, portraying Siqueiros’ complex character will prove a beneficial challenge.
“Often times … you need to internalize a certain characteristic or quality within your character that may run counter to your own beliefs or personality,” Rosales said. “However, as you understand how these ideals and thoughts manifest themselves in your portrayal of a character and what part they play in the progression of a character’s story arc in the piece, you are able to broaden your horizons and understanding as a person and actor.”
Siqueiros’ art pieces profoundly echo this turbulent past and his deeply entrenched ideals. His piece show thick brushstrokes connecting dark paint with canvas, in a style that is both simplistic and raw.
The opera depicts a fairly modern story and will be performed in English to an intimate audience of 150 people. Both Rosales and Johnson expressed their great desire to introduce opera to students in a welcoming manner — something that Rosales describes as a “dream project” for him.
Rosales did not take opera lessons until the age of 13 and admitted that he himself held some preconceived misconceptions about the genre as a whole.
“I was under the impression that opera was a stuffy, arid, inaccessible art form,” he said. “As I became involved with the opera program, however, I learned that it could be edgy, kinetic, engaging, modern and, most importantly, real.”
For Marisa Johnson, a senior majoring in vocal arts (performance), the same holds true. She plays Maria in the play, a woman with a hidden secret who yearns to leave behind her past for the sunny welcoming arms of California.
She expressed that the point of the opera is to bring to light the turbulent events that shaped Siqueiros’ work.
“By having it in Parkside we are bringing it to the undergrads, putting it in their face and making it real to them,” Johnson said.
The performance also hopes to showcase Siqueiros’ intentions as an artist.
“One of his man goals was to do art for the public, not for some classy sophisticated box face,” Johnson said.
Singh encourages the audience to approach the opera without expectations.
“It’s not formulaic, but rather a meditation on this city,” he said.

Kanye West is not a happy man.
“Yoooo they banned my album cover!!!!!” West tweeted earlier this week. “Banned in the USA!!!” read one twitpic caption, and another tweet said, “In the 70s album covers had actual nudity … It’s so funny that people forget that … Everything has been so commercialized now.”
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s new album, features a cover that represents two human-like monsters (or is it monster-like humans?) in a sexually suggestive position on a couch.
West’s tweet sent the media into a flurry as he contended that “they,” particularly the retail mega-corporation Wal-Mart, had banned his album from being stocked on shelves because of the cover art.
Well, as it turns out, none of this — as of yet, at least — is true. According to The Wall Street Journal, a Wal-Mart spokesperson denied any ban, stating the store “did not reject the cover artwork and it was never presented to us to view.”
The Los Angeles Times also reported that West’s label, Universal Music Group’s Island Def Jam, had only “strongly urged” West to use alternate art because of concerns about potential retailers’ boycotts.
So for now, it seems that we can dismiss this whole event as West being silly over the Internet. Right?
Maybe not. There might be a point to be made behind all this.
Big-name retailers have a huge impact on album sales. Wal-Mart alone accounts for 20 percent of CD sales in the United States; therefore, the threat of banning an album, any album, is significant. And so one has to ask: what kind of power are retailers holding over artists?
We tend to forget that musicians, at least in theory, are artists. And being an artist means that you have freedom of expression in the content and form of your work.
But it seems that more and more these days, outside influences are getting a say in what is sold and how. Although West’s album might not have been banned, his predicament mirrors circumstances presented to artists all the time:
Musician sends in explicit lyrics, suggestive cover art or unsavory thematic material.
Musician’s music label says, “If you changed X, this album might be more ‘successful’” (see: profitable), or it might say, “Let’s try not to get banned from stores.”
Musician changes original material, potentially warping the original vision.
This sequence of events is ludicrous when you compare it with other artistic forms. Imagine if Picasso had been “strongly urged” by a bunch of men in suits that his “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon,” which features five nude female prostitutes in an early Cubism style, needed some “alterations.”
That’s a laughable situation, of course, but at the risk of paralleling Picasso with Kanye West, what’s the difference? Fine art is art. Music is art. It’s all art. One form tends to consistently make more money than the other, but that’s really a red herring in the bigger issue of artistic freedom.
This “freedom” doesn’t necessarily include being outrageous just for the hell of it. I’m not sure anyone really needs to experience the sight of classic metal band Pantera’s “anal drill” on the original cover of 1994’s Far Beyond Driven. Thoughtful judgment is a good thing. And superficially explicit art without meaning is, well, meaningless. But outside judgment forced on an artist with good intentions? It just doesn’t seem very fair.
Wal-Mart is particularly good at this sort of manipulation. Not only does the retailer have a policy of only carrying albums that do not have explicit lyrical content, it also changes the names of song titles when it is deemed appropriate. Kurt Cobain is probably rolling in his grave at the thought of his song “Rape Me” being changed to “Waif Me.” “Waif Me?” Really: “Homeless Child Me.” Now I really understand what the song was trying to convey.
Cobain didn’t title the song “Rape Me” just to titillate his audience. He titled it that for a reason. And in the same way, Kanye West commissioned contemporary artist George Condo to design his album cover for a reason as well. The imagery is referenced thematically in his new singles such as “Monster” and “Runaway.” It makes sense.
Besides, is the album art even that controversial to begin with? It’s just silly that an executive had to “strongly urge” him to change it at the risk of losing sales. No wonder West went nuts on Twitter.
At the end of the day, retailers like Wal-Mart have to remember what their purpose is. The purpose of such a store isn’t to regulate or manipulate wholesomeness of products; it’s to sell them. If Wal-Mart is going to decide what’s good for us, shouldn’t it stop selling Twinkies too? Since when is a retail store a provider of life guidance?
This little incident is an interesting reminder of the threats facing the growth of a vibrant pop culture. God forbid that our nation’s children hear a curse word or see a nipple. Musicians, along with filmmakers, writers and other artists, have many things they should strive to do: to stimulate, to make a statement, to express, to create.
Worrying about the opinions of money-grubbing corporations? That shouldn’t ever be on the list.

Charley Snell is a man with a vision. That isn’t to say that the vision didn’t take some time to realize.
Photo courtesy of 2balance
After nearly 15 years at Nestlé, the Chicago native and Marshall School of Business alumnus decided to combine his love of the outdoors, his passion for health and his experience in food production in order to create something delicious.
Snell is the founder and owner of Chicago-based Tenaya LLC and creator of a new, all-natural drink, MADE. He meshed his penchant for responsible production and a healthy small-enterprise environment to bring about a refreshing beverage. Available in eight flavors, MADE is a combination fruit juice and green tea for a health-conscious and enjoyable drink experience.
As a lifelong Coca-Cola drinker, Snell only occasionally stopped to question the ingredients in the soda. The day came when Snell’s background in food production, his growing awareness of what he calls the “food-body connection” and his market research results made him reevaluate his food and drink choices — and their origins.
While making his way through Yosemite’s Tenaya Canyon — after which the company is named — Snell had an idea.
“I had been asking myself, ‘What goes into [Coca-Cola]? What’s actually in this?’” he said. “It was time to become more aware of what I was actually putting in my body.”
That question brought a change of focus to Snell’s life.
“In Yosemite, while I was reading John Muir, I had to ask myself what I was doing,” he said. “Then I had a lightbulb moment.”
That moment came when he decided to mix fruit juice with green tea to create a beverage that is both refreshing and healthy.
From there, Snell made like many an entrepreneur and took the project home. He began drafting recipes from scratch in a friend’s kitchen. One day in March 2008, Snell generated nine test recipes. From there, Snell’s brainchild picked up speed, but the process was by no means an easy one.
“For the first year, I ran [my idea] out of my dining room,” Snell said. “I no longer used [the room] for eating. It had my desk and it was a workspace.”
In May 2008, Snell made use of his contacts in business with Nestlé and from his time as a student at USC. His background working for Nestlé allowed Snell to make advances in areas like bottling the drink in earth-friendly bottles
“I wanted my product to be good for us and good to the earth,” he said.
MADE began distribution in January 2010. By June, MADE had hit shelves in Los Angeles. The Southern California area was Tenaya LLC’s first market, where the beverage was distributed to gourmet and all-natural grocery stores such as Sprouts, Mother’s Market and Erewhon, as well as USC’s Seeds Marketplace.
To date, MADE has also been distributed to the Midwest and select worldwide markets.
Because of Snell’s avid belief in his product and the power of small enterprise, Tenaya LLC is run by a handful of carefully chosen partners and employees who are encouraged to pursue their own passions and love what they do.
“[At USC], I was the so-called ‘marketing guy,’” said Snell, who doubled as a graduate student at USC while working for Nestlé. “[Tenaya LLC’s] current finance director sat in the front of the room during my core classes at Marshall. Half of the people in the company now, I met from my time at USC. I built my business plan with these people specifically in my mind.”
Having hand-picked his personnel, Snell set out to form a company where the inner happiness of the organization is just as crucial as customer satisfaction.
The biggest struggle for Snell and MADE has not been the inner harmony of Tenaya LLC but the process of expansion and distribution.
“Sometimes, it’s a challenge to be realistic,” Snell said. “At a big company [like Nestlé], things just happen quicker. With a smaller enterprise, things happen in a natural process, in a word-of-mouth flow. But I believe that if we just focus on what’s right and people band together to create new business opportunities, a lot of little guys can make a huge impact.”
Snell made it clear that he has not forgotten about the struggles of college life. He still appears as a guest lecturer at USC for Marshall’s Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies — a program which, Snell said, inspired him and his ideas.
“A professor at the [Lloyd Greif Center], Thomas O’Malia, warned me that it would be harder than I thought [to start a business],” he said. “I came back later, and he asked if it had been difficult. I said yes. He asked if I was having fun. I said yes. And he said, ‘Good. Now keep on going.’”
Snell will not be slowing down anytime soon. He has ideas and plans for the future, but for now his focus is on MADE and its distribution.
“I believe that MADE is the best drink out there,” Snell said. “And until that changes, I’m going to keep on going.”

Quantity of student voters can also hold quality
After reading the opinion on youth voting by Adeel Mohammadi, published in the Daily Trojan on Oct. 11, I’ve spent some time considering the argument made.
As a California Public Interest Research Group member I had been one of the people mass registering students. Had I been contributing to the decline in intelligent voting? After some thinking, I have concluded that I do not agree with the argument asserted.
The debate of who should vote is as old as voting itself, and this issue is as relevant today as it was 100 years ago.
And naturally, the argument that educated voters are preferable over non-educated voters has a valid point; if everyone who casts a ballot was fully aware of all the ins and outs of the initiative, politician or party they’re voting for, surely the political atmosphere and decisions would be overall better.
It is not a far-reaching assumption that educated people make better decisions. However, the rather heavy criticism of “mass registration” in the Daily Trojan is not entirely fair.
First, organizations that host these mass registrations, such as CalPIRG, also provide information and try to raise awareness on political issues.
As one such example I would point to the “Vote No on Prop23” campaign that CalPIRG has been conducting, which informs students of the proposition, obviously from the opposite perspective.
Secondly, the criticism in Mohammadi’s article was focused on uneducated young voters — however, uneducated voters are not limited to the youth.
Theoretically, we would then be simply increasing the number of voters that merely vote according to party loyalty or similar, but this brings me to my final and most important argument: voting is not just a right but is often considered a civic duty.
Few people who vote know everything there is to know about a candidate or initiative, which is what is required to cast a fully educated vote. Instead, most people know something about most candidates, and that is enough to make democracy work, which, in the end, is what voting is all about.
So although mass registration might not be the optimal way, it is a step in the right direction.

Strength in numbers
Lucy Mueller’s Oct. 4 article, “Prop 23 requires in-state opposition,” completely hits the mark on this issue.
USC is one of the most influential universities in the country. We need to use this influence in order to help save our beloved state from the greedy agenda of Valero and Tesoro.
These companies are two of the biggest polluters — not only in the state, but in the country as well. California takes pride in its green energy initiative, and Californians should be proud to be on the forefront of green technology and innovation.
Proposition 23 puts our interests on the backburner and will harm us overall by killing our green job market, stopping outside investment in green technology, polluting our air and harming our health.
USC students have a voice — about 30,000 voices overall — and we need to use them to stop Texas oil from interfering with us on our own turf.
With all the politically involved and environmentally conscious organizations on campus, together we can make some noise.
CALPIRG, the California Public Research Interest Group, has two campaigns trying to have USC’s voice heard.
The New Voters Project is attempting to register students to vote so our demographic makes a dent in the decision-making in our government today.
And the No on Prop 23 Campaign is self-explanatory and attempts to get thousands of California voters to pledge to vote no on Prop 23 and save California from the greedy, oil stained hands of Valero and Tesoro.
We might not have the millions of dollars that these two companies do, but we have strength in numbers, and with that we can beat big oil.

Term “immigrant” can be misleading
In response to the article about illegal immigrants on Oct. 20 by Suji Pyun:
First off, I really appreciate this article because it brings up a lot of concerns about illegal immigration policies, especially in Southern California. Are the numbers of illegal immigrants decreasing because of the laws passed by the government? Are their home countries’ economic situations getting better? Or is Los Angeles just not a desirable destination anymore? If not, why? And is it really a good thing that the numbers are dropping? The article definitely opens up a lot of topics for discussion.
However, although simply writing “immigrants” might be shorter than “illegal immigrants” over and over, please remember that there is a difference between the two. I found myself confused for the first few paragraphs, wondering if Pyun was referring to illegal immigrants or to immigrants in general. And then later in the article, there is mention of “Mexican immigrants” which confused me further, because I then wondered if she had been referring to illegal immigrants from Mexico the entire time.
Please be specific because not all immigrants are illegal and not all illegal immigrants are from Mexico.

Like many other typical USC students, Jason Duong, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, was at Stanford earlier this month enjoying the Weekender.
Jovanna Tosello| Daily Trojan
But while there, he received a call that was anything but typical.
“I got a call from university officials telling me that the Obama administration was coming to campus,” Duong said.
As university administrators, faculty, students and all of Los Angeles now knows, President Barack Obama will be holding a rally Friday in Alumni Park. The Political Student Assembly, of which Duong is the executive director, will be hosting the event with one of the president’s chief coalitions, Organizing for America.
Although this event will prompt many of us to put aside our academic and social commitments for a few hours to hear the president speak, we might also be asking ourselves: Why USC?
The campus selection was not random. Obama’s decision to speak at our school is a testament to the university’s increasing global reputation, diverse makeup and location within one of the nation’s major urban centers.
“I feel that USC has been getting a huge amount of prestige over the years — why not take advantage?” Duong said. “It’s known worldwide and it’s the best place to be.”
As USC continues to move up in the college rankings — reflected in our impressive academic prowess, strong network and community involvement — we continue to attract not only competitive students but also renowned leaders.
Times have changed since Obama last spoke as a U.S. Senator in 2006.
Not only will Obama return to campus as commander in chief, but he will be revisiting an entirely different university atmosphere.
Students now have a unique opportunity to show the president how far we have come in just four years.
The chief priority should be to have as many students as possible to attend the rally, regardless of our political ideologies.
“We are working with Organizing for America to reach out to all students,” Duong said. “We are trying to get verbal confirmations so that people will come out.”
But our leaders can only do so much to demonstrate our university’s fervor. Students have the opportunity to set an example — proving that this is the university where different values are effectively channeled through effective discussion.
Many students that are apathetic toward politics might view this rally as irrelevant. Some might say they are too busy or too fed up with politics to attend — which is a mistake.
Admittedly, our political arena today is often more divisive than uplifting. Heated debates, splits over controversial issues and mudslinging are more common than are unifying speeches.
This rally could help infuse the civic activism that has been missing in our universities since the 2008 presidential election.
“We are pushing for activism on campus,” Duong said. “I feel that bringing the president will provide momentum.”
For students, this rally ultimately isn’t about politics or picking one side over another. It’s about us — as diverse a college population as they come — leading the way in a new age of civic discourse.
Let’s send a message to the high school seniors out there watching this rally on the Internet. Let them see a diverse and involved student body, observing the president’s viewpoints with open minds.
“I feel we’ve got a good momentum going. This just adds on to that,” Duong said. “It’s phenomenal. This will not only attract students from all backgrounds, but it is more of an encouragement for them to consider USC when they apply for college.”
For all we know, one of these prospective students might end up in Duong’s position in a few years — a student who finds himself with an opportunity to help host the president of the United States.
May USC continue to be a hotbed for civic discourse, reining in our nation’s top leaders for years to come.
Stephen Zelezny is a sophomore majoring in public relations. His column, “USC on the Move,” runs Thursdays.
I think not. I’d rather see USC morph into the likes of MIT or Caltech. Yeah yeah, I know. SC’s a liberal arts school. But I hope Viterbi and Keck become even more competitive and cutthroat. But yep, we need students, alumni, and whoever engages in the academics here, to parlay their liberal arts/humanities degrees into the soft “people skills” that bring order to society. Eggheads = automatons, right?
Nothing can be gained by Obamas visit, as it is just a pony show. He is as danger to the succes of our contry, as is Brown and Boxer. I am ok with his visit as long as a Conservative politician visits as well, AND the far left liberals give the same respect Obama got from the conservatives, which we all know wont happen, because the far left loons are tasteless, juvenile, and intolerant of others views.
I’m all for feel-good USC articles, but this visit by the President has absolutely nothing to do with USC or a rising trend in USC’s prestige. USC’s campus conveniently provides an accessible forum in Los Angeles for the President to rally voters for the upcoming election. Democrats across the country are concerned that they will lose a significant amount of the first-time voters they galvanized in 2008, and Los Angeles holds high populations of a variety of demographics that the Democrats are trying to re-target for this election cycle. Think about some of the current hot topic issues that appeal to specific Los Angeles demographics – for example Don’t Ask Don’t Tell and Arizona’s new immigration law. Not to mention the youth vote that the Democrats are worried about losing, and that college campuses are prime venues for recruiting young voters and attracting large crowds. USC, not a campus known for its political activism, contains a significant amount of potential voters that the Democrats were likely able to rally back in 2008 with President Obama on the ticket, but maybe not in 2010. If anything, this visit proves that the Democrats are so concerned with their party’s voter turnout prospects for this election cycle that they feel compelled to deploy the President of the United States to a very blue city within a very blue state to rally sluggish voters from their party.
USC’s only part in this equation is that it has a nice campus in the heart of LA.

Good grief!  Please ask Stephen Zelezny never again to take up perfectly good space in the Daily Trojan with such vapid meanderings as this.  Little Barry’s expense-paid-by-taxpayers trip is for the sole purpose of promoting the political careers of Barbara Boxer and Jerry Brown, two of California’s most prominent embarrassments.

The university has recently announced that it will be enforcing additional regulations on game day tailgating, including a ban on drinking games, loud music and DJ booths.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Although the reasons for the ban on extremely amplified sound systems seem logical enough, the prohibition on drinking games is counterintuitive in nature.
According to Senior Vice President for Administration Todd Dickey and Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle, the ban was instituted to reduce the possibility of alcohol-related problems. Dickey also said that drinking games can lead to the overconsumption of alcohol, especially with evening games that allow more time to tailgate.
Carlisle previously told the Daily Trojan that “a record number of alcohol-related incidents and transports to hospitals” this semester have provided the impetus for the new regulations.
Parties on The Row and at off-campus houses might be under closer scrutiny this year for their alcohol-related incidents, but many feel that the general atmosphere of tailgating is one of camaraderie and Trojan spirit, not drunken recklessness.
In fact, Carlisle highlighted how relatively low the number of alcohol problems encountered during tailgating is when considering to the massive amounts of people walking on campus on game days.
If this is the case, the irresponsible actions of a very small minority should not warrant such far-reaching restrictions.
If the university truly wants to decrease the risk of alcohol-related incidents, shutting down a friendly game of beer pong is most likely not going to achieve that goal.
If students want to drink before the game, they will find a way to drink — whether or not they can play a few rounds of flip cup out in McCarthy Quad without a stern cease-and-desist order from DPS.
Alcohol will still be prevalent among tailgaters, and with alcohol comes the risk of alcohol-related incidents, even without drinking games.
Other forms of drinking, especially those involving hard alcohol, might even pose a higher risk than the standard drinking games that are being targeted by the regulations — while games involving hard alcohol are being banned as well, most drinking games are played with beer, which has a lower alcohol concentration than hard liquors and many mixed drinks.
Even while playing drinking games, it is still possible for tailgaters to keep track of their alcohol consumption, which is more difficult to do with mixed drinks that might contain an unknown amount of alcohol.
Still, no matter what the method of consumption is, the possibility of alcohol-related problems always exists whenever alcohol is being consumed.
Although it is true that drinking games might encourage the rapid and seemingly thoughtless consumption of alcohol, the safety of the tailgater lies in his own hands.
Drinking games, like any other form of alcohol consumption, can be enjoyed responsibly. They don’t always have to lead to dangerous levels of intoxication — that is at the discretion of the drinker.
If this privilege is restricted by the university, tailgaters might simply take their pregame festivities off campus.
This situation could actually pose more of a danger to students than a few games of beer pong on campus; DPS has the ability to prevent dangerous situations on campus, but is less able to help in situations that might occur off campus.
Alcohol-related incidents can be dealt with more quickly, and medical emergencies can be responded to more efficiently with the resources that are on campus on a game day.
Campus provides a safe, controlled environment for tailgaters, and it would be safer for people to play drinking games on campus rather than somewhere else.
Ultimately, if alcohol is to be allowed on campus on game day, it should be allowed in all forms. Regulating the manner in which alcohol is consumed will have little impact on the overall alcohol consumption and will merely irritate students.
Outlawing drinking games doesn’t seem likely to reduce the risk of alcohol-related incidents. Irresponsible drinkers will be irresponsible drinkers, whether or not they are playing drinking games. Restricting only a certain form of alcohol consumption will do little to reduce the danger they pose.
Safe drinking is ultimately the responsibility of the tailgaters, not the university or DPS. If tailgaters are given the privilege of drinking on campus on game days, then they should be trusted with this privilege and expected to enjoy it — safely and responsibly.

Driving behavior underground or off campus will not stop or reduce an activity, it will just make it hard for those in trouble to get help.  Being on campus in a public environment means many eyes, and many resources if things start to get out of control.
Prohibition does not work, never has, never will.  Please let us be smarter than ostriches and realize that not seeing something is far different than stopping something.
Nice article.

The football team knows there’s a lot on the line in its next game against the No. 1-ranked Oregon Ducks on Oct. 30 in the Coliseum.
Apparently, fans do too.
A grassroots movement has started on Facebook and Twitter to “Red Out the Coli” — meaning fans would wear cardinal shirts to the game, which falls on Homecoming Weekend.
What began as a hash tag on Twitter has morphed into a Facebook page that has garnered more than 700 fans since its creation yesterday. Supports want you to know, though, that even if the movement is called #RedOut on Twitter, it all means the same.
“Whatever you want to call it, wear it!!” The group’s Facebook page reads.
It might not come as a surprise that a group of dedicated fans is trying to pack the Coliseum with Trojan spirit. In USC’s last game against California, the Coliseum was noticeably more empty than usual — the announced attendance was 72,368, short of the 92,516 capacity.
Thus, the group implores fans, “Come early, be loud, wear red, Fight On.”
And it seems like a certain head coach is taking note of what his fans are trying to do.
Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin): “Full day of preparation. Early practice, film study, oh and someone mentioned a “Cardinal” Red-Out for homecoming…sounds good. Fight On!”
[…] Playing the #1 ranked Oregon Ducks in front of a spirited home crowd clad in cardinal to “Cardinal Out The Coliseum,” with Gameday in the house, on the night before Halloween is as big as it’s going to […]

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Sonia Nazario spoke in front of a packed student crowd at Bovard Auditorium last night as part of USC’s ongoing lecture series on social issues. Nazario spoke about her 2006 book, Enrique’s Journey and immigration — an issue that she said is of the utmost importance, especially here in Southern California.
Nazario’s nonfiction book tells the story of Enrique, a teenage boy in Honduras who embarks on a dangerous and epic journey to reunite with his mother, who is working in North Carolina.
Enrique must travel more than 1,800 miles alone (half of which he does by holding on to the top of a speeding train), first crossing into Chiapas, the southern border of Mexico, en route to the U.S.-Mexico border.
The treacherous route back to his mother is filled with hardships: rail bandits, immigration agents, corrupt cops and criminals all looking to take advantage of the masses of children (which Nazario said total more than 100,000 yearly) who attempt the treacherous trek from Central America and Mexico to the United States.
Nazario actually met Enrique in Northern Mexico, (after his eighth failed attempt at crossing over into the United States) during his initial journey. Enrique’s courage inspired her so much that Nazario decided that she would travel from Honduras to Mexico, just as Enrique did, in order to accurately reconstruct his journey and speak about it from a place of experience. It took three arduous months, but Nazario completed her mission.
Ultimately Nazario said she hopes that her book and current work helps to humanize the immigrant experience, and it truly was an eye-opener for those in attendance.

LACMA’s “Fashioning Fashion” exhibition shows how the dandies and ladies of Europe would have dressed from 1700 to 1915.
Looking at the pieces, one can only marvel. Visitors were surprised to see “feminine” articles for men, such as frocks and vests with removable chest pads. The most interesting pieces in the collection however, are the undergarments — hoop skirts, bustiers, corsets, garters, stomachers, panniers and the first bra ever are all on display.
If one feels that people today spend too much time thinking and molding their bodies into some ideal image, one should remember that it is not half as bad as what people went through in the Victorian era.
From the collection, one can see that obsessing over body image is not a new phenomenon. Men wore codpieces over their genitals to accentuate their bulge in the 15thand 16th centuries.
The collection also shows how European style was heavily influenced by India and the Far East starting in the late 17th century. European fashion embraced the new colors, patterns, textiles and fabrics that came with the East India Trading Company.
Through these articles of clothing, one can see how the changes in history are reflected in fashion.
If you are interested in the history of sexuality, colonialization, class, politics, gender or of people in general — take a look at the clothes of the past.

In their most recent debate on Tuesday, Delaware senatorial candidates Chris Coons and Christine O’Donnell appeared to have differing views about the contents and meaning of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
Republican candidate and Tea Party-endorsed Christine O’Donnell seemed unsure about the amendment’s reference to separation of church and state, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Before an audience at Widener University Law School in Wilmington, Del., O’Donnell asked Democratic opponent Coons, “Where in the Constitution is the separation of church and state?”
She asked her question after Coons explained that because of this separation, the Constitution does not allow religion to be taught in public schools, according to the New York Times.
“Religious doctrine doesn’t belong in our public schools,” Coons said.
In response to O’Donnell’s question, Coons then pointedly recited the language of the First Amendment that proclaims, “Government shall make no establishment of religion.”
O’Donnell continued to question Coons about his assertion, which elicited laughs from the audience.
Matt Moran, O’Donnell’s campaign manager, defended her behavior in the debate, saying she only meant to clarify.
“[She] was not questioning the concept of separation of church and state as subsequently established by the courts. She simply made the point that the phrase appears nowhere in the Constitution,” Moran wrote in a statement.
While the exact phrase “separation of church and state” is in fact not in the Constitution, decisional law by the U.S. Supreme Court over many decades has clarified and enshrined the separation, Coons said.
Regardless of O’Donnell’s true intent, the audience’s reaction suggested that they believed she did not recognize that the principle so fundamental to U.S. constitutional law had derived from the First Amendment, according to the New York Times.

What would you think of California giving a student a substantial scholarship to attend college, only to have that student drop out of school after his first year, throwing away thousands of dollars invested by the state?
Unfortunately, that’s the plight of the current California government. As observed in a study by the American Institutes for Research released Oct. 11, state governments spent more than  $1.4 billion in student grants and more than $6.2 billion in state appropriations for colleges.
Those billions also went toward paying for the education of the 30 percent of freshmen college students who did not return for sophomore year.
And guess which state doled out the most dough to the students who gave up on their education? None other than our own California, which spent more than $466 million in taxpayer dollars between 2003 and 2008 on first-year dropouts in public universities. The AIR’s study also found that only about 60 percent of students who enter as freshman actually graduate.
However, the report fails to say why; its goal was not to diagnose the cause of the overspending but to demonstrate how much of taxpayers’ money is wasted upon freshmen who do not return to college.
Although the college dropout rate is a national problem, it is not surprising to see California at the top of the list, surpassing Texas and New York in expenditures by a wide margin of approximately $26 million and $64 million, respectively.
California’s budget woes are notorious; it seems inevitable that efforts to maintain the world-class University of California system would allow lot of money to slip through the cracks.
Unfortunately, the state seems to neglect its major investments: the students themselves.
Students are future taxpayers and voters — the state is aware of that. But with our increasingly diverse and expanding population, the state has focused too much on numbers, and has consequently provided greater quantity of scholarships and grants, not quality.
Too few students with demonstrated financial need receive scholarships extensive enough to pursue their studies full-time without taking a part-time job.
At USC, many of us are fortunate enough to have that blessing, but that is not the case for most of California.
If the primary reason that students are dropping out is because of an increased financial burden, as California Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell suggests in the Los Angeles Times, then perhaps the state’s diplomatic tendency to give a crumb to everyone who wants a piece of the cake is ineffective.
What’s more valuable to both individuals and the state: giving 10 people modest to full scholarships or giving 50 people grants that barely cover the cost of books?
Being more selective in doling out scholarships is advantageous for both the state and its students.
Enabling a smaller number of students with a more substantial endowment might increase their likelihood to succeed, which means that tax dollars invested in the student will ultimately yield  higher returns.
If a student is permitted the time to study, network, exercise, be at leisure and be in other activities that are important to the collegiate experience, ultimately the student’s years at college might be better.
This is certainly an issue that California’s higher education system should investigate further.
Perhaps, as O’Connell suggested, “We should do exit interviews with students and learn why they leave education.” At least doing so would be an important first step in evaluating the problem further.

Former California Sen. Kevin Murray is now serving as USC’s first politician-in-residence in hopes of providing better resources to students and faculty.
Political wisdom · Former Sen. Kevin Murray has worked with transportation and environmental committees while in the legislature. - Photo courtesy of Kevin Murray 
Murray will be working with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
Murray was appointed only a few of weeks ago, said Ann Crigler, interim director of the Unruh Institute.
“He has already participated in two events for the Unruh Institute and we are looking forward to working with him again,” Crigler said.
Murray attended CSU Northridge as an undergraduate student and obtained his master’s degree in business administration at Loyola Marymount University before pursuing a career in law.
With a Juris Doctorate in law and emphasis on environment, Murray has a wealth of information to provide for USC students, said Michael Quick, executive vice dean of USC College Academic Affairs.
“We knew of Sen. Murray because he had taught in the School of Policy, Planning, and Development and he had helped out the Unruh Institute by meeting with some students who had traveled up to Sacramento to visit state agencies,” Quick said.
His previous experiences include representing California Legislature in the 47th Assembly District and two four-year terms in the California State Senate. He retired in 2006 because of term limits.
Having been in the political scene for years, Murray has experience on transportation, appropriation and environmental committees. He was responsible for drafting multiple propositions that benefitted youth and recreational systems throughout the state.
His duties as politician-in-residence will include a wide array of work, mostly in lectures, panel discussions and interactions with students.
“I hope to work as much as possible and hope to work with anybody interested in public policy,” Murray said.
Murray said he was looking forward to working with students at USC.
“My goal is to interact and have a positive influence on as many students as possible [and] impart some knowledge that I may have on how it works outside of the theory and in real life,” Murray said.
One of his most notable involvements will be with the “Students Talk Back” lunches co-hosted by Unruh and the Daily Trojan. Murray is expected to be a moderator in the upcoming “Students Talk Back” panel on Oct. 26, which will discuss the final week of the state gubernatorial race.
“For the spring semester, he is considering offering a course on how a bill becomes a law by having a class develop a real bill and moving it through the legislative process,” Quick said.
Dayna Leland, a freshman majoring in political science, said she would be interested in learning from Murray.
“I think it’s a great opportunity for all students, not just political science majors, but for the whole of USC community, to have first-hand experience with a state senator. It will definitely help in understanding of the government and the way it functions,” she said.
With no precedent for this position, it is uncertain how long Murray will stay as politician-in-residence, Crigler said.
Correction: 10/20/10 – A previous version of this story ran with an incorrect headline.  This entry has been corrected to reflect the change.
What does “awaiting moderation” mean?
Is that the same as censorship?
You conveniently “forgot” to mention his Political Party Affiliation, Sammi. Don’t you think that this would be an item of interest? By the looks of it, I’d bet that this guy is just another Left-of-Center Liberal. I’m right, aren’t I? And YOU are just like him….trying to pull off something sneaky, hoping no one will notice. The Truth is definitely NOT on your side.

With the intention of advising lexicographers on the best way to do their jobs, a USC professor of linguistics said he incorporates his experience as part of the Dictionary Society of North America into his classes.
Wonder of words · Ed Finegan serves as the American Council of Learned Societies Delegate for the Dictionary Society of North America. - Photo courtesy of Ed Finegan 
Ed Finegan joined the DSNA in 1998, and has served on its executive board since 2007. Currently, he serves as the American Council of Learned Societies Delegate, representing the DSNA at the national conference for the next four years.
“Academics have all these societies reflecting their personal interests,” Finegan said. “From when I was a graduate student I was very interested in certain aspects of dictionaries, in particular how they discuss what’s right and wrong, what you should and shouldn’t do.”
Finegan wants to make sure the DSNA is well represented despite its size. The DSNA is a smaller academic society with 400 members, small when compared with many academic societies that have a few thousand members.
The DSNA is a forum for scholars and practicing lexicographers to come together to talk about what dictionaries should be doing, such as how best to present their information or how to handle electronic dictionaries, Finegan said. Like other societies, it publishes a journal and holds conferences.
Finegan said that ACLS helps him learn better ways to fundraise, hold membership drives and distribute information about the range of scholarship that’s going on in all of the other societies.
“It’s affected my teaching,” Finegan said. “In my Language, Society, and Culture class, I added a module on how to make a dictionary entry from scratch by giving citations from a database and working through the mechanisms of creating an entry.”
Finegan has also begun incorporating dictionary-making tips into the textbooks he writes.
He said joining the society has him reading a wider range of books about dictionary making and about the history of lexicography, such as a book about the Oxford English Dictionary’s first editor James Murray and the help he received from a retired army officer in a mental institution.
The relationship between his teaching and his work in the DSNA is intertwined, Finegan said.
The society, founded in 1975, has also reflected a change in lexicography, with linguists becoming more impactful, partially because words have come to play a more central role in linguistics within the past couple of decades, Finegan said.
“As linguistics has focused more and more on the structural implication on a particular word, that has had some very important implications on what lexicographers pay attention to. Not just meaning, but what kind of subjects and objects and direct objects can go with verbs,” Finegan said.
His first book, Attitudes Toward English Usage: A History of the War of Words, was required reading for Merriam-Webster lexicographers for several years, Finegan said.
The creation of dictionaries has also been influenced by the Internet, because lexicographers can use it to find examples of new word usages, Finegan said. It has also allowed linguists to see how lexicographers modify entries in real time.
“With online dictionaries, not only can you get some very fresh material, but in the Oxford English Dictionary, every once in a while they put up the ongoing revisions. That’s very exciting because not only can you see the language changing, but you can also see lexicographers doing their work,” Finegan said.
This semester, Finegan is teaching in the Legal Writing, Research and Advocacy Program in the Gould School of Law.

After two years of work, a team of researchers from the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism  launched a hyperlocal news site, featuring content in Chinese, Spanish and English that encourages community members to participate in the site’s news coverage.
The website, Alhambra Source, exclusively serves the citizens in the City of Alhambra, a diverse   community east of Los Angeles that is 52 percent Asian, 36 percent Latino and 11 percent Caucasian.
The Alhambra Project began in 2008 when Annenberg researchers, led by communication professor Sandra Ball-Rokeach, searched for ways to increase civic engagement. The project seeks to do so by keeping people informed and allowing cross-cultural communication, said researcher Nancy Chen.
“We want to break the ethnic divide in the community and allow people to discuss their local affairs and overcome their linguistic barriers,” Chen said.
The idea for the site originated from Michael Parks, former director of Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and former editor of the Los Angeles Times. Parks said he believes that large news outlets such as the Times have failed to encourage civic participation.
“We’ve had the assumption for a long time that an informed citizenry, informed by the press, would take an active part in the decision making in the community. We’ll see if we can move the needle there,” said Parks, who currently examines how local news sites such as Alhambra Source can have an effect on the people.
Both USC researchers and members of the Alhambra community submit updates to the site. However, participation from the community is inherent in the design, Parks said. Its contributors range from experienced journalists to local high school reporters.
The researchers plan to use surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of the news site, Chen said.
“We’re hoping that two years along the road we can do a follow-up survey to determine if the website has had an impact on the level of civic engagement and current patterns of intergroup interactions,“ Chen said.
The project is funded by a grant from the Annenberg Foundation. Researcher Katherine Ognyanova said that the goal of the project is to grow and become financially independent, however.
“We’re hoping it could end up financially sustainable so that USC can turn it over to the residents,” said Ognyanova, a fourth-year doctoral candidate studying communication. “We’re struggling to come up with a good sustainable business model.”
Despite economic concerns, Ognyanova says she remains optimistic about the future of the site.
“We’d like to reach everyone,” Ognyanova said. “For the first year, getting to 10 to 15 percent of Alhambra would be great.”
Managing editor Daniela Gerson, an alumna who received her master’s degree in specialized journalism in 2009, said the Alhambra Source will help guide similar projects in other cities in the future.
“The ideal is that it could serve as a model for communication in diverse communities across the country,” Gerson said. “These communities will become increasingly common as the country becomes more and more diverse.”

After four decades of rapid illegal immigration growth in Los Angeles, the city is now approaching a more stable future according to a study conducted by a USC professor.
Dowell Myers, a professor in the School of Policy, Planning, and Development, conducted a study that shows the number of new arrivals in Los Angeles is about half of what it was in 1990.
The ratio of immigrants well-acclimated in Los Angeles to immigrants new to the area is about six times greater than it was in 1990 and three times greater than it was in 2000, making it easier for newcomers to have assistance, Myers said.
“This means that there are fewer newcomers and the immigrants who have lived here longer have put down their roots and have been more economically productive,” Myers said. “Also, an advantage for the newcomers is that there are more old timers to help them find jobs, housing and adjust to everyday life.”
A consensus survey helped determine where people are from and whether they are new to Los Angeles or have arrived in the last five years, Myers said.
According to the Pew Hispanic Center, the amount of immigrants entering Los Angeles averaged 800,000 per year from 2000 to 2004, which dropped to about 500,000 per year from 2005 to 2008.
“The children of immigrants have been growing and the big revolution that happened in the last few years is that the majority of the people in California are born in California,” Myers said. “Now we have a home grown generation that is positive for the state.”
In the Los Angeles area, the number of Mexican immigrants is decreasing, Myers said, but the numbers are still higher when compared to other cities.
Myers said he believes that the immigrants will help pull the nation out of recession in the next few years.
“For things to get moving again, you need more spending and more consumers,” Myers said. “It all has to be restarted. Immigrants are a strong force that will be pushing forth because they have more spending. While older people have bought their houses and are spending less and less, immigrants will spend more, making it a positive boon for all businesses in California.”
Interesting article summarizing a study.  Apparently we still have 1.5 million immigrants to LA between 2005 and 2008.  It has become fashionable to ignore the legal status of immigrants, which is noticeably absent in the article.  Is this an important factor in the discussion?  The article suggests these new immigrants will be spending more money and helping the economy.  Whose money are they spending?  How much more government funding is required to support the influx of 1.5 million people to LA in a three year period?  Prior to that it was roughly 3.2 million over four years.  Perhaps the details missing from this article are included in the study, but I doubt the illegal immigrant population suddenly arrives have significant sums of money to simply spend.  Traditionally much of the money is sent back home.

Reform Judaism magazine recently named USC one of the top institutions of higher education chosen by Jewish students, ranking 11th among private colleges and universities.
Mazel tov · Alex Kojfman, USC Hillel director of student life, works in the Hillel building located near the corner of Hoover and 32nd streets. The organization aims to develop leadership opportunities for its members. - Dario Griffin | Daily Trojan 
The rankings were compiled on the basis of academic courses and programs offered in Jewish studies, extracurricular activities available on campus, including social and religious programs, and the total percentage of Jewish students in USC’s undergraduate population.
“From a spiritual perspective, USC has a number of Jewish student groups and community centers, such as Hillel and Chabad, and these organizations provide opportunities for Jewish students to explore their religious identity,” said Varun Soni, dean of religious life at USC.
The rankings also took into consideration the strong relationship that the Office of Religious Life has with the university. USC has more than 80 student religious groups on campus, the highest in the nation, Soni said. Six of these groups are dedicated to supporting Judaism.
“Los Angeles has a remarkably diverse and active Jewish community, and USC works closely with our Jewish partners in Los Angeles and around Southern California,” Soni said.
USC also offers resources on campus for Jewish students, who make up approximately 12 percent of the undergraduate student body, such as USC Hillel, a Jewish student organization that aims to develop leadership opportunities for its members in both the university and local community.
Alex Kojfman, director of student life for USC Hillel, said the ranking reflects the active Jewish community on campus.
“Some students come from high schools with a small Jewish population, so they look for a school, like USC, with a large Jewish community,” Kojfman said. “[Former] President [Steven B.] Sample has made USC a de facto place for Jews to come.”
Michael Jeser, executive director of USC Hillel, believes that USC’s ranking is accurate of the university’s efforts to reach out to Jewish students.
“It’s hard to measure; you’re looking at data and feedback from people, but 10 to 15 years ago USC wasn’t as friendly to Jewish students,” Jeser said.
In addition to student groups, the university also sponsors the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, which was established in 1994 by award-winning film director Steven Spielberg, a longtime trustee and benefactor of USC.
The institute was established to collect video interviews of Holocaust survivors and witnesses and has accumulated nearly 52,000 testimonies since its inception.
Jewish students at USC said they agree with the high ranking that the university received from Reform Judaism.
“I’ve noticed and appreciate the university’s ties to Jewish organizations like the Shoah Foundation and the Hebrew Union College,” said Jeff Cohn, a junior majoring in cinema-television critical studies. “Although I’m not religious, I maintain a strong Jewish identity culturally and applaud the university for its endeavors to maintain a healthy cultural diversity on campus.”
The university also offers multiple academic opportunities for its students interested in Judaism. The USC School of Religion has partnered with the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion to offer a bachelor’s degree in religion with an emphasis in Judaic studies. In addition, students may obtain a minor in Judaic studies and take courses in Hebrew.
“USC now has more Jewish students than Brandeis University, and I believe that prospective Jewish students are attracted to our large and engaged Jewish community on campus,” Soni said.
Additionally, the College of Letters, Arts, & Sciences hosts the Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life, an organization that supports research regarding what it means to be Jewish in America. The institute sponsors numerous events throughout the year, including various lecture series, conferences and symposia that relate to Jewish life.
“Over the last 20 years, USC has been extremely proactive in creating unique curricular and extra-curricular opportunities for our Jewish students,” Soni said. “This new ranking reflects the fact that we have been successful in our endeavors.”
