Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley passed for two touchdowns and ran for another, leading USC to a 24-13 victory over Boston College in the Emerald Bowl on Dec. 26.
The Trojans jumped out to an early 14-0 lead via two Barkley touchdown passes to redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili — appearing to push away the demons that haunted them in the closing weeks of the season — but the Eagles fought back.

Boston College running back Montel Harris ran 23 times for 102 yards and one touchdown, including a dominating series in the second quarter in which he carried the ball four times for 48 yards and a score. Later in the period, 25-year-old Eagles freshman quarterback Dave Shinskie connected on a 61-yard touchdown pass to receiver Rich Gunnell to close the gap to 14-13.
When the Trojans’ first play of the second half proved to be a Barkley interception that gave Boston College the ball at USC’s nine-yard line, it appeared momentum was on the Eagles’ side.
But Harris was stuffed at the line and fumbled, and USC recovered and took the ball back the opposite way for a field goal. A stout Trojan defense proceeded to hold Boston College scoreless the rest of the way to secure the victory — one they said was important.
“We needed to do something good and feel good,” coach Pete Carroll said in his postgame press conference. “There was a lot of distraction and a lot of adversity going into this thing, most of it self-inflicted. I’m very happy with the way we turned our focus and the way we accomplished things inside.”
USC (9-4) struggled to its worst finish this year since 2001, suffering four Pac-10 losses and turning up embarrassing performances in blowout losses to Oregon and Stanford late in the season.
Although many expected another flat performance at the Emerald Bowl, the Trojans showed up — but didn’t dominate.
Boston College had a shot to win until a fourth-quarter interception by redshirt junior cornerback Shareece Wright iced it for the Trojans.
“We certainly felt going in that we could win,” Eagles coach Frank Spaziani said in his press conference. “We knew how we had to play. We made too many mistakes. It’s frustrating.”
Boston College (8-5) lost its second straight bowl game while the Trojans picked up their 32nd bowl win — the most all-time.

Redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford had 17 carries for 72 yards, and redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams pulled in 12 catches for 189 yards for the Trojans — including a spectacular 48-yard catch in the second half — in what was his final game in Cardinal and Gold. Williams told reporters after the game he would decide within the next two weeks whether or not he would declare for the NFL draft.
As a whole, USC will surely face much scrutiny in the weeks to come concerning the ongoing Joe McKnight investigation and draft decisions from other juniors.
Junior defensive end Everson Griffen told the media after the game he would declare for the draft.
But the bowl game was a good sign, the players say, for what’s to come.
“We needed this ‘W,” Havili told the Associated Press. “We’re happy to start next season with a win. We had a great two weeks of practice and it was all a matter of executing.
“Yeah, we’re used to playing in the Rose Bowl but we’re still motivated to play and to win this game, since this is where we played. We had a great game plan up front. It was a growing season. We had a lot of young guys step up.”

For part of the 2009 season, Matt Barkley gave USC fans reasons to cheer.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
There was the game-winning drive he led against Ohio State on the road. There was his three-touchdown pass performance that helped the Trojans top Oregon State.
But for other parts of the season, the true freshman quarterback gave the Trojan faithful many reasons to groan, namely because of inconsistent outings against Oregon, Stanford and Arizona.
Saturday night at the Emerald Bowl, Barkley stayed true to form this year and gave fans a little bit of both.
The boy-wonder that was at first paraded around as the best thing to hit college football since the forward pass — then swiftly swept under the rug when he showed his age — had his moments both spectacular and youthful in USC’s 24-13 win over Boston College at AT&T Park in San Francisco.
For the most part, Barkley was stellar, finishing the game 27-of-37 for 350 yards and three touchdowns (one rushing). But on more than a few occasions, like on his two interception throws, the 19-year-old showed that he could still be a teenager.
Barkley started fast, hitting on 12 of his first 13 passes and two quick touchdown passes to fullback Stanley Havili by the early portion of the second quarter. Barkley looked as confident and on-target as he had all season.
Then, coming out of the halftime, the freshman dropped back and glued his eyes to his intended receiver, telegraphing in an ill-advised pass that was intercepted on USC’s first play of the third quarter.
But it turned out to be one of the few lapses for Barkley Saturday. Although many USC fans turned on him just as quickly as they crowned him, he left no doubt that he was the right choice to be the Trojans’ quarterback of the present and the future.
Since USC finished the regular season 8-4, USC fans did what all fans do when things go wrong: they second-guessed. Barkley was the primary focus of the attack. I lost count of the number of times I overheard someone say that USC coach Pete Carroll’s decision to start the youngster was ludicrous, and backups Aaron Corp or Mitch Mustain should have been given the nod.
These opinions, as they always do, changed in accordance with which side USC ended up in the win-loss column that week. When USC won, Barkley was the hero, a man beyond his years, a true prodigy. When it lost, he was too young and not ready.
Let’s get this straight. Age by itself counts for very little. Experience, on the other hand, goes a long way.
For proof of this, look no further than the Boston College sideline at the Eagles’ quarterback. Like Barkley, Dave Shinskie is also a freshman at the helm of a Football Bowl Subdivision college football team.
The difference? Shinskie is 25.
Yet before the season, Shinskie had started the same number of college football games as Barkley: 0. And the two ended up with very similar statistics. Shinskie threw 14 touchdowns against 13 interceptions during the regular season, while Barkley threw an almost identical 13 and 13. Both led their teams to 8-4 records.
See how much of a difference six years makes.
The lesson here is that Barkley was the best option for USC this season despite his youth because in terms of experience, he was practically even with Corp and Mustain.
Corp took very limited snaps in his first two years and played pitiful in his only start against Washington. Even though Mustain started and won eight games as a freshman at Arkansas before he transferred to USC, something more must have been lacking for him to fall to third on the depth chart.
So although he has not been perfect, Barkley’s up-and-down play this season has come to symbolize the entire year for the Trojans as a whole. At times, it had you making a double take, unsure if what you just saw really happened. Yet at others, it had you throwing your hands up in disgust.
And the Emerald Bowl was no different. The Trojans were still only able to hold off an inferior Boston College team by 11 points, and it took a few big breaks and late into the fourth quarter to do so, but in the end, the Trojans got it done.
All in all, the sky did not fall and cause Armageddon at Heritage Hall this season. Sure, the team did not live up to unreasonable expectations and the true freshman could not match unfair hype.
But what Barkley gained in experience — a bowl game victory, hard-fought victories on the road and gut-checking losses in the Pac-10 — is going to go a long way in righting the USC ship that had briefly lost its way.
Please please please start barkley the next 3 years and keep telling yourselves he’s the best. The rest of the pac 10 is laughing and your D better be up to the task
