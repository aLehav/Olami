After a USC turnover midway through the first half, Head Coach Andy Enfield threw his hands in the air and turned his back to the court. Enfield’s frustration would sum up the night for the Trojans. 
In an anticlimactic trilogy game and rubber match, USC fell to UCLA 69-59 in the semifinal game of the Pac-12 Tournament Friday night. The 59 points for the Trojans were the fewest since Feb. 3 against Arizona State.
“We had some guys that had a little off night tonight putting the ball in the basket. We need a higher assist total for us to reach our potential offensively,” said Enfield in a post-game press conference. “We just need to be more efficient.”
USC has now failed to make it to the Pac-12 Tournament Championship game in its last four appearances. The Trojans haven’t won the tournament since 2009. 
Junior guard Boogie Ellis led USC with 27 points on an efficient 9-of-17 shooting — his most as a Trojan. 
“I was just trying to do whatever it took to help my team win the game,” Ellis said.
Outside of his play, consistent contributions were limited: Senior guard Drew Peterson added 11; junior forward Isaiah Mobley had 9 points on 4-of-11 shooting. Key rotational player and freshman guard Reese Dixon-Waters missed the game too. 
The Trojans shot 40% from the field — the fifth straight game the Bruins have held their opponents to under 50% shooting. 
“Unfortunately, we could not keep up with the scoring, even though it was a fairly low-scoring game,” Enfield said. “We had our chances, but some of the shots went in and out. We didn’t turn the ball over a ton. But it puts a lot of pressure on your defense when you can’t score the ball when you need to.” 
As tip-off came around, the energy inside the T-Mobile Arena created frantic energy between the crosstown rivals. Both sides fed off it, coming out to strong starts — USC made 3 of its first 4 field goals.
However, that was the last of the Trojans’ efficiency for the night. 
UCLA’s staunch defense made play difficult for USC. From dribbling around the perimeter to calling a play to setting an off-ball screen for a player, everything became a hassle for the Trojans as they struggled to fall into any offensive rhythm, shooting 31% from the field in the first half. 
Finding space on offense became as tedious as finding affordable gas. USC fell into multiple deep droughts without a field goal. They hit only one basket in the final four minutes of the first half. 
While the Bruins also experienced the drought, being held without a field goal for four minutes late into the first half, personal fouls on the Trojans kept UCLA comfortable. A Bruins team that shoots 73% from the line on the season shot 81% in the first half. 
USC managed to hang around, going down 8 points into the break.  
It seemed like the tide was turning early into the second half. The Trojans kept UCLA without a field goal for almost four minutes. The drought cut the Bruins lead down to 4 with momentum shifting back to USC. 
UCLA proceeded to go on an 11-4 run and grapple more control of the game with more than 10 minutes remaining. Freshman guard Peyton Watson came alive for the Bruins, hitting consecutive jumpers after barely playing in the first two meetings.
Even as it seemed like the Trojans would get over the hump, two things would happen — either a scoring drought came around for USC. Or the Bruins simply stay ahead behind their composed play. 
Four players scored in double figures for UCLA. 
“Their four players are very good one-on-one players. They’re experienced, they’re older,” Enfield said. “Our defense was pretty solid, but they’re very good one-on-one players. They can really put pressure on your defense and they make tough shots.”
Coming into the night, the Trojans had a combined 50 turnovers over their last three games. USC cleaned it up, for the most part, Friday night — it turned it over 9 times in the game. 
The Trojans have now lost three of their last four games going into tournament play, their longest losing streak of the season. 
“We’re going to stay confident, we’re going to be in the gym and we’re going to be ready to go,” Peterson said. “These are the tests we need as we head into obviously the biggest weekend of the season so far.”
USC, eliminated from the Pac-12 tournament, will now await its seed for March Madness Sunday.

Recently filed emails from former USC water polo Head Coach Jovan Vavic’s bribery trial depict conversations around applicants’ finances between USC Athletics officials. The trial, part of the Operation Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, has brought renewed attention to the role of wealth in the admissions process. 
Federal prosecutors implicated Vavic, the only athletic coach in the admissions scandal who brought their case to trial, as a participant in William “Rick” Singer’s college admissions scheme. Vavic allegedly accepted bribes that went toward the water polo program and his children’s private school tuition in exchange for designating select applicants as student athletes. 
USC dismissed Vavic in March 2019 when the federal investigation was first announced. Vavic pleaded not guilty to charges for federal programs bribery, conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud. Lawyers representing Vavic filed the email conversations as part of a request to call University officials as witnesses in the trial. 
The emails published in the filings contain messages between former Athletic Director Pat Haden, former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and associate Athletic Directors Scott Wandizalik and Alexandra Reisman. While Heinel pleaded guilty last November to wire fraud for her role in the scheme, Haden, Wandizalik and Reisman have not been implicated or accused of wrongdoing by authorities.
In the newly released communications, Reisman frequently referenced the wealth of applicants, writing to Heinel about an applicant in 2013 that “will be at least a $1 million ask if we get her in.” 
“They’re like the Anheuser Busch family $$$$,” Reisman wrote in another email, writing that an applicant’s grandfather was the founder of a non-specified beer company. The applicant’s family “gave $20 million to a university in Canada,” Heinel noted, writing that there was “major potential for them.” 
In one of the released emails, Reisman wrote that she feared “intel” she received indicated that a family of an admitted student “was going to screw us on a gift.” The student had desired a position within the football program with the hope of “[getting] a boyfriend who is on the team.” 
“You’ve done enough to get her in – they need to pay up,” Reisman wrote to Heinel. 
Glenn MacKinlay, a former Massachusetts Assistant United States Attorney representing Reisman and Wandizalik, defended his clients in a filing on Wednesday, writing that their action “was perfectly appropriate” and that they “had nothing to do with Admissions,” but noted Reisman’s “poor choice of words.” 
Both Wandizalik and Reisman remain associate athletic directors at USC. 
Another email showed Haden, while serving as athletic director, requesting Heinel and Reisman provide “info on kid trying to get in.” “Is this THE GUY who was supposed to give us the $2 million or is this his relative?” Reisman wrote. Heinel responded affirmatively, “He is the one with the big money.”
Brandon Fox, Haden’s attorney, said his client was only doing his job, as athletic directors are expected to participate in University fundraising efforts. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Fox said that Haden did not “condition any student’s participation on a team to a donation” during his time at the University. 
The application process for student athletes differs from the standard admissions process for traditional applicants, given the emphasis on athletic achievements over academic performance.
Rebecca Chassin, assistant dean of undergraduate admissions, testified in September 2021 that students admitted to USC as a part of the scandal were “highly unlikely” to have gained entrance “without their athletic talent.” Chassin added that “their grades and test scores are far below our general students we admit.” 
Vavic’s trial marks a closing chapter tied to the Varsity Blues scandal. Nearly three years since news of the scheme broke in March 2019, the scandal has led to 50 guilty pleas and a nationwide conversation about unfair admission practices at top-ranked universities such as USC. 
“USC and our admissions processes are not on trial. The government has charged Mr. Vavic with taking bribes and deceiving USC’s Office of Admission by falsely presenting Mr. Singer’s clients as student-athletes,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “USC moved promptly to fire Mr. Vavic as the water polo head coach on March 12, 2019, the same day his indictment and the Varsity Blues investigation became public.”

Head Coach Andy Enfield needed to patch some holes heading into the second half with the Trojans down 3 against Washington. 
First and most evident: Stop graduate student guard Terrell Brown Jr., who had 21 points at the break. He scored just 2 points in the second half. 
Next: Get his own scorers involved. Junior guard Boogie Ellis did just that, posting 10 second-half points. 
The final goal: Close the game out, simple as that. Junior forward Isaiah Mobley came up with two huge defensive stops in the final 30 seconds to seal the win, an emphatic check to close out No. 3 seed USC’s 65-61 win over No. 6 Washington in the Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinals. 
“Down the stretch, big-time players gotta step up,” said Mobley in a postgame press conference. “People always say, ‘Defense wins championships,’ and we’re a team that believes in that … It was big-time money on the line, and we got stops.”
Before Mobley’s heroics, the Trojans were tumultuous in the clutch, committing 4 turnovers inside the last two minutes of the game. 
“I know it’s late, but we didn’t want anyone to leave the arena,” said Enfield jokingly after the postgame press conference. “We kept it very interesting until the final buzzer.” 
Similar to when USC faced UCLA in Westwood, turnovers marred the Trojan offense. Washington’s zone and aggressive double-teaming early on led to steals and errant passes, forcing 3 turnovers in the first five minutes of play. On the night, the Trojans committed 23 turnovers. 
“Our veterans had a lot of turnovers; it’s uncharacteristic to have that many,” Enfield said. “It’s not like our freshmen were doing that, it was our upperclassmen. If [we] want to win more games in this tournament and the NCAA [Tournament], we have to do a better job.”
USC’s carelessness in possession was overshadowed by the Huskies’ poor shooting. Washington hit just 30.8% of their shots from the field and 27.3% of their 3-pointers. 
Brown Jr., who led the Pac-12 in scoring in the regular season, looked unguardable in the first half. He scored the Huskies’ first 9 points, carving up USC’s defense with a variety of layups and jumpers. 
“We made some defensive mistakes [in the first half],” Enfield said. “We decided to trap his ball screens in the second half, put more pressure, make him give the ball up … Our guys did a terrific job [against him] in the second half.”
The second half showed a different story, as Brown Jr. shot 1-of-12 from the floor to finish the game with 23 points. 
“Just taking it personally, as a team, nobody wants guys to come out here and score a lot on us,” Ellis said. “We told each other that, if we could shut him down in the second half, we could win the game, so we did that.”
With the defense sorted out, Ellis’ offense in the second half performance lifted USC above the Huskies. He found his groove in his jumper, posting 17 points total on 3-of-5 shooting from beyond the arc.  
USC move on to face UCLA for a third time this season, this time in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals. The crosstown rivals are set to play at 8:30 p.m. Friday at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nev.
