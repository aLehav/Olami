America is facing a crucial crisis of leadership that could alter the country’s future, acclaimed political expert David Gergen told students and faculty at Bovard Auditorium Thursday, calling on audience members to embrace their roles as decision-making citizens.
Gergen, who has been an adviser to four presidents and is currently the editor-at-large at US News & World Report and a political analyst at CNN, was speaking as part of The President’s Distinguished Artist And Lecture Series. After being introduced by USC President Steven B. Sample, Gergen spoke to the audience about the impending restructuring of global dynamics.

“The issue for us is, when the great nations of the world are sitting around the power tables 25 years from now — China will be there, India will be there, Japan could be there — will America be there? Will we be at the head of the table?” Gergen said.
Referencing influential historical figures from Winston Churchill to Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gergen told the audience about the importance of determined leadership and how strong personalities can shape the future of an organization, whether university or a nation.
“Individuals matter. Leadership matters and the quality of the leadership is the ‘X-factor’ in so many organizations,” Gergen said. “We need to think about that as a society, as we think about where this nation is going.”
As a political expert who has lived through 10 elections, Gergen said he had seen the country through a number of ups and downs, and understood the irrational fear that many in the United States felt after the economic crash. But, Gergen added, the relative improvement since last year doesn’t mean the country is already on the right track.
“We are no longer heading over the cliff,” he said. “[But] that does not mean we’re going to return to the way it was before.”
Speaking about conversations he had with analysts both at his television job and as a professor at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, Gergen said America would have to focus on tackling its biggest issues over the next few years, rather than leaving the problems for future generations.
“We haven’t had the kind of leadership we need to build a sturdy future,” Gergen said. “The truth is we haven’t faced up to our biggest problems.”
Specifically naming education, health care and energy as the most crucial issues of the time, Gergen said a large part of dealing with these issues would fall on the shoulders of President Obama, who won last year’s vote on a campaign of hope and promise.
“Doubts are setting in about whether he is this great president that we all thought he was,” Gergen said. “He is having a hard time making the transition from campaigner to chief executive.”
Gergen said Obama’s need to split the difference rather than take a stand on every polarizing issue, from health care to Afghanistan, could affect his ability to succeed as a president as well as set the tone for the nation in the 21st century.
“There are areas in public life where you have to make a tough decision, where you have to get it done. There are times where you have to lead from the front,” Gergen said. “Time is not our friend now.”
Many members in the audience said they were impressed by Gergen’s speech and appreciated his nuanced comments about leadership in the United States.
“I thought he was incredible … especially his insight into the intellect of a leader,” said Walter Ponce, 27, a resident of Los Angeles. “It was also interesting that he hinted at the malaise settling into the country after the past few years of, what I call American imperialism.”
Katey Finnegan, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she felt Gergen’s comments about the president were very fair, even though he was coming from a different point of view.
“It was interesting, I liked how he noted what he liked about Obama, and also gave constructive criticism,” Finnegan said. “I also think it was very important that our leaders have to go beyond just doing their jobs and encourage others to lead.”
In concluding his speech, Gergen underscored what he felt was the importance of leadership for the country, by insisting that tough decisions don’t only fall to the people in power, in boardrooms or in the media.
“To leave it on the president is not enough,” Gergen said. “Our future rests incredibly on the quality of our citizenship, those who are not in the White House, those not in the studios. This is a bottom-up society.”
He has always been a trader
Didn’t Gergen also and more importantly say that if we continue down our present path that the standard of living of our grandchildren will decrease by 25%?

It isn’t that Casey Crescenzo, lead vocalist of Boston-based prog-rock outfit The Dear Hunter, doesn’t enjoy Los Angeles appearances as a rule; it’s the Knitting Factory specifically that rubs him the wrong way.
“I mean it’s not like we don’t like playing LA — we love playing LA,” said Crescenzo, the group’s multi-talented frontman and a Southern California native. “We love playing Hollywood, Pomona and San Diego, everywhere in Southern California…”
On the prowl · Coming off a headlining tour, The Dear Hunter embarks on yet another round of shows as the opening act for Thursday. The group plays at the Knitting Factory Friday. - Photo courtesy of East West Records
From being denied a parking space for the band’s tour van to Crescenzo’s own mother being barred backstage access, it’s suffice to say that the men of The Dear Hunter have been spurned by the well-known venue on more than one occasion.
A forgive-and-forget tactic is probably the best approach at this point: The Dear Hunter has a gig at the less-than-hospitable Hollywood Boulevard music club tonight. The band will be opening for the hardcore New Jersey group called Thursday, and play alongside two other supporting acts, Fall of Troy and Comadre.
The Dear Hunter embarked on its current tour with Thursday on Oct. 5, a scant two days after wrapping up its own headlining tour in Denver. Crescenzo maintains that the band does not mind going on the road again without any semblance of real downtime.
“If it was no break and then we were going out with a band that we hated, it would really suck,” Crescenzo said. “But it helps that we like the bands we’re going to be touring with.”
While the fellows of The Dear Hunter — having had positive past experiences performing with Thursday and touring with the Fall of Troy — are looking forward to the rest of its tour dates as an opening band, Crescenzo and his bandmates definitely enjoyed the headlining leg of their lengthy cross-country road trip. The headlining tour — a series of eight stops largely concentrated in the Midwest — made for an altogether different experience for The Dear Hunter as a touring band.
“It’s different … It’s obviously not the same size turnouts as when we’re opening for somebody, but it’s really amazing to have everybody in the room excited to see you,” Crescenzo said. “We can play every song that we really want to play and we want people to hear, as opposed to, you know, songs that we’re trying to … gain new fans [with].”
For Crescenzo, the most basic function of a headlining tour is not to win over new fans, but to please existing ones. No one is pretending, however, that the recently completed headlining tour — with the North Carolina-based group Annuals opening — comprise some sort of philanthropic crusade to bring smiles to the lips of The Dear Hunter devotees: The band has an album to promote.
Act III: Life and Death, released this past summer, is the third installment in a planned six-part saga detailing the exploits of an unnamed central character often referred to as “the boy.”
The Dear Hunter put out a total of three full-length studio albums with its current label, Triple Crown Records. The two previous chapters in the developing six-part tale were released within eight months of each other from late 2006 to early 2007.
The story for the second chapter, Act II: The Meaning of, and All Things Regarding Ms. Leading, first came to Crescenzo in the winter of 2004 while he was still a member of the post-hardcore group The Receiving End of Sirens. Although Crescenzo — who formed The Dear Hunter as a side project — was the sole creator behind the concepts of Act II, the band’s third installment of the saga was more of a collaborative effort with his band mates.
“I have a very stubborn idea of where things are supposed to go, so the big difference [with working on Act III] is just having more people around to kind of validate or turn down, you know, what you’re doing,” Crescenzo said of the changes to The Dear Hunter’s creative process.
He was quick to clarify the extent of the collaboration, however: “I don’t necessarily think it would be called ‘co-writing.’”
Crescenzo is also working closely with Australian artist Glenn Thomas in the creation of an animated video for “What It Means To Be Alone,” a track from The Dear Hunter’s most recent album. Crescenzo recently finished his part in the process — filming people act out the scenes in the video.
Now all that’s left is for Thomas, who has also done album artwork for the band in the past, to trace the clips. When the video comes together, the visual style will be most similar to something like A Scanner Darkly.
The band has a standing interest in incorporating visual elements into its music, from issuing deluxe edition of Act III that comes with a storybook for Act II to the upcoming animated music video.
“I’ve been, you know, trying to get something visual for the records for a long time,” Crescenzo said. “I think we’ve always been interested in doing something visual to accompany our recordings but … There’s no money to accomplish something like that.”
With the a video about to drop, the bulk of an ambitious tour still laying ahead of them and exactly half of their epic six-album saga still to go, The Dear Hunter has more than enough on its plate to keep Crescenzo and his bandmates busy until the saga comes to a close.

The crisp fall air buzzed with palpable excitement as a large line began to form outside of Bovard Auditorium Wednesday night.
“Yay, porn!” exclaimed an overly excited individual waiting to witness the Porn Debate. His enthusiasm was justifiable.
Pornography, as we all know, involves sex. And sex, besides the obvious attraction of its pleasurable aspects, is a necessary facet of human life.
Porn avenger · Craig Gross, founder of XXXchurch.com, debated with Ron Jeremy about the negative effects of porn at Bovard Wednesday. - Ryan Alam | Daily Trojan
Most of us learned this in elementary school, but let’s take a quick refresher course. Human beings require only four things to continue to thrive on earth: food, water, oxygen and the ability to reproduce. We share these same traits with animals, a fact that many consider to be degrading. Although we do not frown upon a friend when his stomach rumbles in want of the next meal, the very mention of sex makes many people squirm in their seats.
Two “master debaters” took center stage in Bovard, which is only 20 miles removed from the heart of the American porn industry — the San Fernando Valley — to tackle America’s cultural taboo of sex and discuss the positive and negative aspects of the insanely profitable industry. In one corner stood Craig Gross, founder of XXXchurch.com and a strong advocate for those struggling with porn addiction. It came as a pleasant shock when a young man casually dressed in jeans and a white button-down emerged behind the curtains upon Gross’ introduction.
Behind the opposing podium stood Ron Jeremy, a stout, Hawaiian-shirted figure sporting long curly black locks and his trademark moustache. “The porn king” — affectionately nicknamed “The Hedgehog” for reasons that cannot be fully detailed in this family-friendly university newspaper — has starred in more than 1,800 porn films in his lengthy career.
“I’ve had sex with about 4,000 women,” Jeremy said. “[Gross] has been with his wife about 4,000 times. I respect that.”
One might expect an animosity to exist between these men who represent two wildly different spectrums, but the two proved quite the contrary as they playfully joked about Jeremy’s colorful sexual exploits throughout the night.
“I have no problem with what he does for a living,” Gross said.
The “pastor of porn” clearly understands and respects the porn industry’s right to produce pornography and an American citizen’s right to watch its product.
“All of you have the right to see as much porn as you want, but most of you are unaware that this isn’t something that you can just turn off,” Gross warned.
A barrage of statistics and factual data about the incredibly young audience that porn attracts and its degrading treatment of women were Gross’ weapons of choice. The boyishly energetic Jeremy countered these facts by reminding the audience that the 18-plus rating on pornographic content demonstrates that the product is targeted for a mature audience.
Jeremy contradicted this when he conceded that “there is no such thing as ‘please watch porn responsibly,’” and that young teenagers have found easy access to porn online.
On the other hand, Jeremy rejected Gross’ claim to porn’s degrading treatment of women and assured the audience that most female porn stars are not fazed by their job.
“The majority of girls you have heard about have had happy, productive lives today. There’s a small group that is having problems, but the vast majority are not,” he said.
One aspect of porn that the two sides seemed to agree on were that its characteristics are deeply rooted in fantasy.
“Pornography is not what you are going to find in a real-life relationship,” Gross said.
Jeremy furthered this point by comparing the porn industry to Hollywood. Indeed, both produce content that allow their consumers to choose which fantasy they would like to experience, yet porn is the industry that is scorned.
Unfortunately, the two men never fully devoted their arguments to the intriguing idea that addiction is not caused by pornography, but instead by a person’s complex psychological nature. Though Gross’ argument was powerful, the “pastor of porn” must realize that religion can only provide hope for some since it is not universally practiced. Therefore, the hope for an end to sexual addiction rests in the rigorous study of human psychology.
@Scott – I agree (unfortunately) the porn makers are tapping the evangelical market. As for sexual repression leading to sexual obsession, I agree it can happen, but it doesn’t have to – http://www.covenanteyes.com/blog/2009/09/29/alfred-kinsey-christian-culture-and-sexual-repression-reexamining-old-beliefs/
I am suspicious of Craig Gross and his intentions.  I’ve looked in to his message and his software and it is my honest assessment that he is actually peddling porn in to churches.  Sites like XXXChurch.com handle porn addictions the way fashion magazines handle fad diets.  From what was written in the article it doesn’t sound like he tried to make much of a case.  The whole thing is to introduce Ron Jeremy to a “born again” clientele.
Given the current barrage of virginity promises, purity balls, and abstinence-only sex education; evangelicals are becoming pornographers most lucrative market.  And they’ve been dumbed-down to not be savvy to the real cause-effect syndrome of pornography; look at how much evangelical support Sarah Palin had in spite of stark family hypocrisy.  Sexual repression leads to sexual obsession, and evangelical groups are pushing the repression hotter than ever while pornographers are cleaning up like never before.  Preachers vs the Skin Trade is and almost always has been one of the most bizarre symbiotic relationships that has ever existed.

Despite attempting to unify the many Greek councils, the third annual Greek Week, which wraps up today, received mixed reviews from council leadership.
All five Greek councils were invited to participate in the weeklong event, which included an all-Row Monday Night Dinner and a new member luau on Wednesday for all new Greeks, both of which had as many as 300 students participate.
The right notes · Members of Alpha Phi sing on the lawn of Gamma Phi Beta during Thursday’s Karaoke Night, a part of Greek Week, which aimed to involve all councils. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
“Increased participation is an overall goal,” said Laura Redfern, vice president of communications for the Panhellenic Council. “We want to expand our diversity and include multiple Greek councils.”
Redfern said that interaction between the councils in the last few years has been limited to the Panhellenic and Intrafraternity Councils. This year, however, both IFC and Panhellenic are actively attempting to boost cooperation with other non-Row councils through events such as Greek Week.
“We as a council have made a concentrated effort to reach out to other Greek councils to make sure they felt included and invited and are coming out to the events,” IFC president Nick Hamada said.
Francis Sandoval, president of the Multicultural Greek Council, said the council had looked forward to Greek Week as a way to get more involved in USC Greek life and raise awareness about the importance of other councils.
In the end, however, Sandoval said she was disappointed with the number of MGC members that turned out.
But she said she thought all the councils, not just IFC and Panhellenic, should be involved in planning Greek Week in order to increase attendance across councils.
“I think because MGC is not involved in the planning for [Greek Week], the members of MGC are not as encouraged to attend,” she said.
Taren Fujimoto, a senior majoring in print journalism and a member of Delta Phi Kappa, an Asian Greek Council sorority, said the AGC also only had limited involvement in Greek Week.
“As far as the Asian sororities and fraternities are concerned, they aren’t that involved with Greek Week. They kind of see it as an IFC and Panhellenic thing,” Fujimoto said.
Fujimoto said the only outreach she noticed from the other councils was a Facebook invitation to Greek Week events.
One council, however, did see Greek Week as a unifying experience.
Samantha Castro, president of the InterGreek Council, said Greek Week was a great way for IGC to become more involved with other Greeks.
“Before this year, there was a huge distance between us and the rest of the Greek system, and we are trying to unify that gap,” Castro said. “I think we’ve taken a lot of good steps forward.”
This year’s Greek Week also included a new all-Greek Service Day on Tuesday, in addition to other regularly scheduled activities. The philanthropic event, which was initiated by IFC and Panhellenic, had members of the Greek community lead students in making 2,500 sandwiches that were donated to the Los Angeles Mission, a non-profit organization that distributes food to downtown’s Skid Row.
“A big part of Greek life is service in the community … so we wanted to make sure that it was a part of Greek week this year,” said Hamada.
Redfern added that Panhellenic plans to hold all-Greek service days each semester in order to better focus on building a culture of philanthropy and interfraternalism between all Greek councils.
Sandoval said she wants to be involved in planning the All-Greek Service Day. She said that although there has typically been a divide between the fraternities and sororities on the Row, and though Greek Week did not fully succeed in bridging that divide, she wants to continue to work to meld the various councils.
“I think that we do want to work with the other councils,” Sandoval said. “Before everyone was kind of on their own and independent, but now I think we need to work together to improve the Greek community.”
Greek Week at USC just suck in general. The school should cancel the entire event. What a waste of time and money.

Riding a season-high seven- game winning streak, the No. 14 USC women’s soccer team begins Pac-10 play this weekend at McAlister Field against No. 20 Arizona State and unranked Arizona.
The Women of Troy (8-3) have outscored their opponents 15 to three during their unbeaten run, feeding off of an improved offensive attack and a young defensive line that has matured with every game.
Goal-stopper · The play of senior goalie Kristin Olsen is a major reason for the team’s turnaround — she has four shutouts in five games. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
“After being on the road for so long, the team has grown a lot,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We’ve talked to the kids about how much they’ve learned and how much they’ve grown.”
Senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen’s play has been one of the biggest reasons for the Women of Troy’s recent success. Olsen has posted four shutouts in her last five games and has earned the Pac-10 Player of the Week award twice this season.
“I think every coach in the country would love to have a goalkeeper like Olsen that is good with her feet, can jump from post to post and basically cover any angle on goal,” Khosroshahin said.
“It’s always like ‘Yes, I’m glad she’s on my team,’” added junior midfielder Alyssa Dávila.
Olsen’s success is more impressive when considering that the Women of Troy have featured six different starting defensive lineups in their 11 games, including three different units in their past three contests.
“She keeps us organized,” said redshirt senior defender Meagan Holmes. “I don’t think there’s been one weekend where we’ve had the same backline.”
The return of Holmes, who played her first game last Friday since she suffered a knee injury on Aug. 28, should help solidify a young backline as USC begins conference play.
The Women of Troy will first welcome Arizona State (7-1-2) on Friday at 3 p.m. The Sun Devils are on a streak of their own, having gone unbeaten for seven games since a 1-0 loss to Kansas on Aug. 30.
Arizona State is led by junior forward Karin Volpe, who tops the team with four goals. Volpe had two goals and two assists for the Sun Devils in their last outing, a 4-0 victory over Northern Arizona.
Senior defender Liz Harkin, a three-year starter and an All Pac-10 first team performer a year ago, is the leader of a defense that has allowed only seven goals on the season.
Arizona (3-7-1) will take on UCLA today before facing off against the Women of Troy Sunday at 1 p.m. The Wildcats have struggled in the non-conference portion of their schedule, getting outscored 22-11 by their opponents.
Sophomore forward Renae Cuellar has been a bright spot for Arizona, scoring six goals on the season to lead the team. The Wildcats were picked to finish seventh in the conference in the preseason Pac-10 poll.
USC is 10-3 all time against Arizona State and 11-3-1 overall against Arizona.

Notre Dame and USC, two historic rivals, not only compete on the field but also in the high school recruiting process.
USC’s most recent recruiting class is laden with talent — punctuated by true freshman signal-caller Matt Barkley. But there will always be those players that elude USC coach Pete Carroll’s grasp.
One such player, linebacker Manti Te’o, has shorn up a suspect Notre Dame defense that has lagged behind a high-powered offense for most of the season. He was first drawn to Notre Dame after watching the Irish’s classic game against the Trojans in which Reggie Bush pushed Matt Leinart over the goal line for the 34-31 victory.
Although Te’o is still young, Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis has decided that the ways in which Te’o can impact a game more than compensate for his occasional gaffes that stem from his inexperience, and plans to increase the freshman’s playing time against USC.
Te’o will see the Trojans next Saturday in South Bend.

If it seemed like the USC men’s water polo team couldn’t fit much more into its weekends, then think again.
The Trojans could potentially play six games this weekend, as they face a Friday doubleheader against No. 15 Princeton and Golden West College, and the SoCal Tournament on Saturday and Sunday. This marks the fourth weekend in a row in which USC has had at least two games scheduled, but this weekend promises to be the biggest of them all.
Familiar foe · Senior driver Justin Rappel scored key goals in the USC men’s water polo team’s 11-4 win against Princeton in last season’s match. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
“Before we start the season, [coach Jovan Vavic] puts us through one of the most grueling hell months among any of the sports on the campus,” senior two-meter Jordan Thompson said. “Six games [in three days] is a first — it’s a challenge — but we’ll face it and bite the bullet.”
The Trojans will return to McDonald’s Swim Stadium for just the second time this season, squaring off first against a formidable Princeton team that started the year ranked in the top 10, but has since dropped off after going 7-4. The Tigers have been battle-tested so far in 2009, facing then-No. 4 UCLA, No. 16 Santa Clara, No. 19 Brown and No. 20 Johns Hopkins in their first five games. USC and Princeton played each other for the first time last season with the Trojans coming out on top 11-4, behind goals from junior driver Devon Borisoff and senior driver Justin Rappel.
“[Princeton] has always had a crafty team, and our coaches prepare us to expect the unexpected,” Thompson said.
The latter match of the day is USC’s second scrimmage in just as many weeks, as the Trojans face Golden West, a team often considered to be one of the premier community college water polo teams in the nation. The Rustlers won the 2008 California state water polo championship in their division, and have won 19 titles since beginning play in 1966.
On Saturday, the Trojans will travel to Irvine for the SoCal Tournament, a two-day event that is USC’s third tournament of the season. The Trojans won the event last year and showed their sheer dominance in doing so, scoring 49 goals in four games while holding their opponents to a combined score of only 19. USC beat Stanford 8-7 in the final, scoring on a game-winning shot in overtime to secure the championship title.
USC will face No. 17 Bucknell in the first game of the tournament, and then play either UC Davis or UC Santa Barbara depending on the result. USC is 3-0 all time against Bucknell, but the two teams have not played since 2004. The Bison are 11-6 this season, and had a four-game winning streak before losing to No. 15 Princeton. But they responded by beating No. 18 Navy,
“Because we lost a game early in the season, this tournament holds much more [significance] than any other tournament we’ve played this season,” Thompson said. “It’s absolutely vital that we go in and set the tone early.”
If the Trojans can advance, the odds are certainly in their favor to win in the second round; USC has never lost in 14 games to Davis, and is 53-12-2 all-time against Santa Barbara. But with the packed schedule in front of them, getting through the weekend will be an additional challenge in and of itself.
I too find this journalist’s writing skills to be superb.  I am unfamiliar with the depth of the water polo sport, but am amazed by how much I have learned in just one article.  I am surprised, but impressed by Mr. Bianchi.  Great job, fellow Trojan!  You have a natural talent worthy of compliment and pride.  You’ll go far in your future endeavors.
Whoever wrote this article is amazing… The way he delivers facts yet still gives you insight into how the team has prepared for this tournament is something you don’t see in the journalism world anymore… I really wonder what high school taught him these journalistic skills…. People, remember the name James Bianchi, this kid has a future for sure…

At first glance, you can tell there’s something special — something different — about Louis Zamperini.
He wears a cardinal USC hat and is 92 years old, but he’ll forgive you for thinking he’s 60. Most men his age are confined to their homes, but you can tell that Zamperini doesn’t live that life. In fact, he probably does more physical activity than the average 30-year-old. He’d challenge you to a skateboard race, but he quit about 10 years ago when he did exactly that and broke his collarbone.
Up until two years ago, Zamperini would also race you down the mountain skiing double black diamonds. As a 92-year-old, he performed moves I don’t dare try on a bunny slope.
He still trims trees and bushes with his chain saw and trash talks during the nine holes of golf he regularly plays with men 30 years his junior.
But these characteristics are a by-product of his story — the story that he leaves home to tell four or five times per month, as he did on Wednesday to USC students at the Catholic Center. These characteristics only partially explain why Zamperini is the greatest and most inspirational Trojan alive.
“You just have to be around him for five minutes to know what kind of influence he has on others. He can motivate and inspire,” said USC track and field director Ron Allice, who established the annual Zamperini Award for the most inspirational person on the team.
It’s not hard to understand why.
Zamperini should be dead. In fact, for just about a year, he was. His parents got a death certificate signed by former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt more than a year after his plane crashed in the middle of the Pacific Ocean while he was on a search-and-rescue mission in 1943.
As his plane was sinking, Zamperini tried to wriggle free, but was entangled by wires. He finally gave up hope and lost consciousness.
That is, until he found himself alive, awake and floating inside the plane. He used his USC class ring, which latched onto a hook on the plane,  to pull himself out  the window of his old life and up to the surface of his new one. Upon reaching the surface, he snagged the tail of a life raft that was about to drift off.
Zamperini, who converted to Christianity a few years after World War II ended, has only one explanation for how he managed to escape the grip of the wires while unconscious.
“There was no way I could have gotten loose by another human. A miracle took place. God saved me,” he said.
You’ll understand, then, why he hates how the word “miracle” is thrown around too loosely and too often today — he doesn’t even use it to describe the other two plane crashes he survived.
So his prize for escaping death? Living on a life raft with two other survivors in the middle of the Pacific Ocean — for 47 days. He fed on raw fish and albatross; when you’re hungry, you’ll eat anything.
“It was like a hot fudge sundae with whipped cream,” Zamperini said.
The story doesn’t end there. On the 48th day, he was picked up by Japanese sailors and put in a prisoner-of-war camp for two and a half years.
During those years, he endured taunts, torture, betrayal, dehydration, attacks by insects and experimental injections. Once, a guard known as “the Bird” struck him on the temple with a brass belt buckle. After asking Zamperini to take the toilet paper off his head that he was using to stop the bleeding, the guard hit him again.
But Zamperini survived using the mental strength he obtained when he was a kid running the mile. He held the high school world record for 20 years and the national collegiate record for 15. He raced in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and shook the hand of Hitler himself.
Zamperini was freed after the war ended. After becoming a Christian in the ’50s, he has since forgiven every Japanese guard who wronged him, including the Bird.
It would be impossible to guess that Zamperini went through all this torture because he is so upbeat and positive these days. He has to be — it’s who he is. His heart is twice the size he is.
“If you’re in any kind of conversation with him, everything is positive. He is a very inspirational person just in his day-to-day actions and life philosophy. He’s not ordinary,” Allice said.
It’s hard to be ordinary when you hold the record for most Olympic torches carried (five) and you have a Nazi flag in your closet drawer that you stole from a bar at the Olympics when you had a little too much to drink. But not many 92-year-olds have done, or can do, the things on Zamperini’s résumé.
The next time you walk through the gates of Cromwell Field, take a look to your right. You’ll see a fountain with the name of the plaza above it. It’s the name of the most inspirational Trojan alive.
And you’ll know why the crowd at the Catholic Center gave him a standing ovation.
“Spittin’ Sports” runs Fridays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Kenny at klegan23@gmail.com.
Being a relative newcomer to California and living among throngs of USC Alum, I enjoyed  your article on Louis Zamperini.  It was refreshing to read about such spirit and accomplishment.  Also… my  new Trojan friends will think me quite knowledgeable when I make mention of him at  parties.
Not to dis Zamperini, but I’ve heard him say his Torrance High School class ring saved his life. He must have been wearing both rings. The airport in Torrance is named Zamperini Field and the high school football and track stadium is also named after him.

The No. 13 USC women’s volleyball team travels across the city tonight to take on crosstown rival No. 16 UCLA at Pauley Pavilion in a much-anticipated matchup that begins at 7 p.m.
The Women of Troy (13-2, 2-2) are coming off a rollercoaster of a weekend that saw the team win a five-set thriller over No. 15 Cal last Friday only to suffer a sweep at the hands of No. 7 Stanford on Saturday.
Experienced veteran · USC will be banking on production from senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan 
UCLA (12-5, 2-2) represents the latest challenge for the Women of Troy in a very strong Pac-10 Conference. The Bruins are tied for third in the conference for opponents’ hitting percentage (.163), third for digs (15.04 dps) and fourth in blocks (2.68 bps). UCLA has a 13.66 kps average while hitting .233 as a team.
Similar to USC, the Bruins defeated Cal and lost to Stanford last weekend.
USC coach Mick Haley is looking for his team to steady its course tonight at Pauley Pavilion, a place where the Women of Troy haven’t won since 2005.
“We have a chance to really step up here and get the Bruins at their place and get some momentum,” Haley said. “We’ve been trying to improve every week that we play. If we can constantly do that, I think we’re right on schedule to keep getting better.”
Improving every week may be easier said than done in the Pac-10. The conference has a record eight teams ranked in the Coaches Top 25 poll. But even though most teams USC faces the rest of the season will be tough, tonight’s matchup against the rival Bruins means something special to coaches and the players.
“The game’s always one that you want to win, and as coaches you always want to own the city,” Haley said. “It’s the only place in the US where you have two Division I teams [that are] usually both top-10 teams in the same city. It attracts a lot of attention, and we certainly want to do well.”
USC’s success so far has relied on the consistency of senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin, sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter and sophomore setter Kendall Bateman.
However, Haley is looking for more players to step up, particularly on the right side of the court. While Gysin and Jupiter have performed well on the left side, junior outside hitter Kimmee Roleder has been inconsistent so far on the right. If her struggles continue tonight, Haley may shuffle his lineup.
“[Freshman outside hitter Katie] Fuller has been playing very well in practice lately. She may challenge Roleder, which makes our team stronger,” Haley said.
On the other side of the net, UCLA’s junior outside hitter Dicey McGraw and 6-foot-5 sophomore middle blocker Amanda Gil pose major obstacles to USC’s gameplan.
Although USC has controlled McGraw in the past, she is leading the Bruins this season with 202 kills (3.42 kps), 115 digs (1.95 dps) and 229.0 points (3.88 pps) — and is looking for a breakthrough performance against the Women of Troy tonight.
Gil, who Haley believes is the bigger threat, has 125 kills (2.27 kps) while hitting .370 with a team-leading and Pac-10 leading 85 blocks (1.55 bps).
“She creates some obstacles because those kids can put their hands over the net quicker,” Haley said.
The USC coach feels if his team can serve well enough to keep UCLA away from the net and pass enough to get the offense moving, the Women of Troy will come out victorious. But either way, it’s going to be a tough match against a strong rival.
“It’s going to be a pretty even battle,” Haley said. “It will be interesting to see how everybody adjusts to it.”
The Women of Troy have lost three (3) matches so far this season. The first was to Michigan St. back there unless that didn’t count for some unknown reason. The other two were in conference which the article duly notes. The out of conference schedule was a complete disgrace meeting no team that would test the Trojans prior to the conference schedule to show where they need  help. Keeping Lauren Williams on the bench for half a match makes no sense with her height and ability to block at the net.  This group with another year under their belt has  not progressed at all from last year’s squad.

With USC football resting, the team will likely spend some of Saturday watching the important games of the weekend. Here’s a list of a few games that could hold special interest for the Trojans, not to mention the country.
Wisconsin at No. 9 Ohio State, 12:30 p.m., ABC.
Ohio State rebounded well following its loss to the Trojans in early September, and have crept closer to returning to the No. 8 ranking that it held just before USC handed the Buckeyes their first loss.
The Buckeyes hope to avoid suffering the same fate twice as they welcome Wisconsin to the Horseshoe for an important Big Ten matchup.
The Badgers are hovering around the top-25 rankings, and a win in Columbus on Saturday would definitely turn the attention of the voters towards an unbeaten Wisconsin team.
No. 3 Alabama at No. 20 Mississippi, 12:30 p.m. CBS.
Before the season started, this looked like a potential matchup of two unbeaten, top-five SEC teams going at it to make a statement in a tight SEC race. Instead, that game will be in the state to the southwest of Mississippi, but the game is still important in the national college football picture.
Alabama, talented on both sides of the ball and undefeated, picked up right where it left off last SEC regular season, just before two losses to Florida and Utah sent the Crimson Tide sliding down the rankings.
Mississippi, which rose to No. 4 in the country until a loss to South Carolina last week derailed the team, is still dangerous while led by quarterback Jevan Snead. Ole Miss will have to defeat the Tide if it hopes to re-enter the national title picture with one loss, something the Trojans can relate to.
No. 1 Florida at No. 4 LSU, 5 p.m., CBS.
Quick. If the BCS rankings were released today, what team would the rest of the country be chasing at No. 1?
If you said the Florida Gators, you would be surprisingly wrong. In fact, a quick Google search of “projected BCS” reveals that not only do the Gators sit behind one team, but behind two — Alabama and then LSU.
But this Saturday, two teams, who both would sit above the Trojans (projected No. 7) if the rankings were released, face off in Baton Rouge in the biggest game of the week.
The questions leading up to the SEC battle in Louisiana will be about quarterback Tim Tebow. After suffering a severe concussion two weeks ago against Kentucky, Tebow remains a game-time decision. If Tebow is unable to play, the Gators must turn to unproven redshirt sophomore John Brantley.
LSU is coming off a strong victory over Georgia last weekend, in which its anemic-for-an-SEC team average of 321.6 yards per game was increased by a 368-yard game — including 156 rushing — in the win.
I think with alot of practice, Corp can be a 3rd string QB at a Division III School.  Sorry…he just does not have what it takes to make it at at premier Division I program. This was a recruiting “oops”, coaches should have spent the scholarship on a kicker.  I know it, the people reading this comment know it,  and I think the coaches it.  Corp makes poor decisions when it reallyt counts.  My 5 year old girl can throw the ball to target if their is no pressure……Corp, do us all a favor, transfer and let Mustain be the back up.

“There are lots of swimming pools in LA, yes?” Ana da Silva brightly asked me over the phone.
It was 20 past 11 p.m. on the eve of da Silva’s first trip to Los Angeles. After barely seven hours of sleep,  the co-founder of British post-punk band The Raincoats would meet bandmate Gina Birch, catch their bus and then run to the train. The train would take them to their plane and, within hours, the pair would be arriving in the unfamiliar city.

It seems only fitting that the legendary all-female group wouldn’t find its way across the ocean until after the first wave of LA punk had died down. The Raincoats’ appearance in Los Angeles is as rare as the occurrence of rain in Southern California.
As headliners at the Part Time Punks Festival in Echo Park Sunday, The Raincoats see Los Angeles as just the latest stop on its already wild ride.
“I’m sure I’ll be surprised when I get there, pleasantly,” said da Silva, who has been using Google Earth throughout the past week to get a better look at where in LA she will be playing.
An established band with a devoted cult following, The Raincoats will be the leader in a concert lineup that features mostly young and emerging bands. These young groups and their expanding world of computers and music software have opened up a new path for punk.
“Punk has become a very freeing and spontaneous way of thinking,” da Silva said. “It is quite rebellious, and wants to be fresh and challenge the status quo and that’s why it has lasted.”
This Echo Park performance is a chance for loyal fans of  The Raincoats to come out and finally see a show live in Los Angeles. Da Silva said they are coming here to show “the fact that we aren’t sweet, young things anymore, but we can still do it.”
Da Silva and Birch formed The Raincoats in 1977 while they were students at Hornsey College of Art in London. The original members included da Silva on vocals and guitar, Birch on vocals and bass, Ross Crighton on guitar and Nick Turner on drums when they had their first gig in November 1977.
In 1978, The Raincoats became an all-female band, establishing itself as one of the first all-female punk bands. With Paloma “Palmolive” Romero on the drums and Vicky Aspinall on the violin, The Raincoats embarked on its first UK tour in May of 1979.
“I knew four or five chords when we started,” da Silva said. “We just thought about things and started writing songs, and eventually had enough to create an album.”
Even with the inexperience of its members, The Raincoats released its first single, “Fairytale in the Supermarket” the year of its first tour. In 1980 there was a change in the lineup, when Palmolive left the band and Ingrid Weiss joined, marking the start of the band’s second album Odyshape.
In the beginning, The Raincoats sound was full of loud, intense instruments paired with the echoes of screeching voices. Its songs exposed true issues that women faced while sparking followers in both the punk and grunge genres.
“Basically, we had courage and cheek,” da Silva said.
Despite the band’s success and influence on the music scene after three albums, the band broke up and members went their separate ways in 1984. After being apart for nine years, something important happened — The Raincoats had a career boosting encounter.
“Kurt (Cobain) and Courtney (Love) came to my place of work for a new copy of the first album,” da Silva said.
The Raincoats had already been discussing reissuing its albums, but meeting Kurt Cobain and seeing his interest in the band’s music sped up the process. With Cobain’s support, Geffen Records helped the band reissue its albums. Cobain even invited The Raincoats to play with Nirvana on tour, but he died before the tour began.
“We did a few gigs to celebrate the new CDs, and it felt so good,” da Silva recalled of its reissued album.
The Raincoats created its fourth album, Looking in the Shadows, in 1996. This album included the musical styling of Anne Wood on the violin and bass, and Heather Dunn on drums.
Since 1996, the band has been doing sporadic gigs and playing with groups like Chicks on Speed (2003). They have kept themselves fresh by playing a variety of festivals including, Ladyfest Leeds (2007) and Donaufestival (2009).
The Raincoats have been lucky enough to play random shows here and there, and have had continued success with its albums. They have stood the test of time by adapting to modern technology such as electronic recording and sound mixing advances. The band as a whole has embraced computers and the new age of sound and performance.
“I would like to learn how to make an electronic instrument,” da Silva said. “I like sound a lot.”
Another reason The Raincoats has been influential is the member’s  approach to the band’s overall appearance. As an all-female group, the members’ mindset about image and clothing has helped them survive in a material world.
“We just wear what we are comfortable in,” da Silva explained. “We don’t have an image or anything.”
In a world driven by consumerism, it is surprising that The Raincoats never got caught up in making music for the fame and fortune. Instead, The Raincoats have been a success by playing music they love and working hard for themselves and no one else.
When looking back at their career, da Silva realized that she has very few regrets.
“We did things right when it was right to do them,” da Silva said. “I can’t think of anything too strong that I would say that I should have done this or that.”
When asked about her favorite memory, da Silva’s response was refreshing when compared to the answers many would expect from today’s consumer-driven stars and groups.
“Gosh, there has been lots of nice things,” da Silva said. “I really love playing.”
The members’ love of playing and dedication to their art has solidified The Raincoats as icons in the punk community, mainly because da Silva and her bandmates believe that the music is the most important aspect of their job.
“It’s how people receive [the songs] in the end that really matters,” da Silva said.

Video game designers — especially those looking to produce something truly meaningful — must have some self-esteem issues. After all, their medium simply doesn’t command the same level of respect as film.
Just read Roger Ebert’s creakingly unprogressive columns about the inability of video games to attain the same art and business status that film enjoys to get a sense for the widespread nose-thumbing among film critics afraid of shifting dynamics within a visual medium often compared to film.
Things are changing, however, as the industry moves from its profitable-yet-vapid adolescence into a period that will herald just as much narrative and artistic experimentation as the stagnant sequels and recycled characters that have defined the last decade in video games.
Much of this experimentation is coming — as it did for film students in the ’60s and ’70s — from graduates of video game design schools. Many of these developers use an education in critical thinking and theory to create smaller, independent games that compensate for low-budget with experimentation.
But when David Jaffe — that loudmouthed video game developer behind the legendary and staggeringly profitable God of War and Twisted Metal series — famously claimed he would make a game that would bring tears to the player’s eyes, the steady cultural shift within the industry became truly apparent.
Of course, Fumito Ueda already beat Jaffe to the punch. Ueda’s two games, ICO and Shadow of the Colossus, are widely cited by proponents of the medium as examples of the potential for true artistic expression through narrative and gameplay experimentation.
Shadow of the Colossus — that 2005 masterpiece of unimpressive graphics, awkward player control and magnificently minimalist storytelling —  especially redefined what a game made under the masthead of a large, controlling studio like Sony could be.
Thankfully, the news that Ueda’s beloved game would be adapted into a film was met with the sort of derision from fans that the outcry over previous games more distinguished by excellent gameplay than narrative — Resident Evil, for one — could not have predicted. Transferring Ueda’s narrative to the silver screen could be a disaster of epic proportions.
Video game-based film adaptations make a lot of sense for both industries. For a studio head, the collective potential box office energy of a video game fanbase smashed together with a movie fanbase must be practically erotic.
Yet, and few will argue this point, movie adaptations of video games are a particularly awful subset of recent cinema. Sure, Mortal Kombat was amazing back in the third grade, but most people would struggle to name an adaptation that rose above even mediocrity. Here’s an abridged list: Super Mario Brothers, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Wing Commander, Tomb Raider, Max Payne — these films are memorable for naught but their failings.
The fatal difference between cinema and video games is best illustrated by Andrej Bartkowiak’s misguided adaptation of the beloved Doom — itself not exactly a benchmark for narrative quality — which featured a long scene shot entirely from the first person perspective in an effort to recall a first-person shooter. An interesting concept, flawed because the moviemakers forgot that self-determination — the ability to move from scene to scene even within a rigid storyline — is the most important difference between games and film.
Though culled from an otherwise utterly forgettable film, the Doom example is important because it illustrates the near-insurmountable gap between video games and movies that precludes the success of film adaptations: The driving forces behind the different narrative styles are essentially incompatible. In video games, the player pushes the action. In movies, the filmmakers push the action. Glibly-yet-honestly, the difference is as simple as that.
Just because a game has a beloved following and a masterful narrative shouldn’t make it an immediate candidate for adaptation. The also-still-in-development Bioshock adaptation, which has potential but could just as easily follow its predecessors down the path to mediocrity is another example of this notion.
Shadow of the Colossus is brilliant because of its relatively uncinematic narrative. For those unfortunate enough never to have played it, the game essentially follows an almost silent protagonist who wanders a vast and empty wasteland fighting giant lumbering monsters. Not exactly the stuff of blockbuster cinema, but Hollywood will undoubtedly have no qualms about sacrificing the soul of the narrative to make it profitable.
The differences between Shadow of the Colossus the game and the theoretical Shadow of the Colossus the movie — which could be amazing. I’m merely speculating using an advanced critical process called educated guessing — illustrate the nearly antithetical motion of the film and game industries
Games, both independent and blockbuster, are rushing forward from their nostalgia-inducing but artistically ignominious origins toward possible widespread acknowledgment of the medium’s capabilities as more than just a business.
In this manner, film is hardly progressing at all, a trend ironically epitomized by movie adaptations of video games. The dynamic is changing: Video games are already on top financially, perhaps they can also follow suit as works of art.

Mozart, Picasso, Wright, Shakespeare, Dylan, Dickens. Point out one who doesn’t belong. Dylan, right? Wrong. That’s Bob Dylan we’re talking about, and he completely belongs. So when I heard he was releasing an album this Tuesday, I looked up everything I could about it.
I was very disappointed when I found out it was a Christmas album, not necessarily because Dylan had written a Christmas album, but because it was being released on Oct. 13.

Brace yourself. The Christmas creep is upon us, and it doesn’t care how light your pocketbook has become. In an effort to gain more market share, companies are rolling out Christmas even earlier this year; but with limited customer budgets, it may not be in a company’s best interest to push Christmas out early.
Economics drive sales, not Christmas spirit. In a down year for the economy, it’s more likely that customers are just going to get irritated with the Christmas creep than engage in the impulse buying that retailers covet.
Prior to this year, the Christmas creep felt more to consumers — as Stephen Hoch of UPenn’s Wharton School of Business put it — like the trend you see when the NFL season extends into February or when the World Series moves its way into November. No one is going to revolt against it, but it was certainly irritating to see. There’s no doubt the creep has been successful in years past, but with the downturn in the economy, there could be some resistance to the typical Christmas push this year.
Herb Kleinberger, of IBM Business Consulting Services, agreed that while promoting early is an excellent way to rake in some early business, and reaffirmed that “jumping the gun too soon can create an emotional pushback.” Customers have to be in the mood to Christmas shop, something that’s difficult to stimulate in early October when the weather is still hitting the mid-80s.
Of course that hasn’t stopped retailers from trying to put customers in the mood.
Retailers will do anything to jump-start the season. Step into a department store and you’ll see it in the displays of happy families smiling as they receive warm sweaters as gifts. Check your mail and you’ll see the Christmas catalogs taking up your whole box.
Step into your car and you’ll see it, too. Residents of La Crescenta reported sights of a truck driving around advertising Christmas light installations. There’s no escaping it. It swamps customers and can only lead to pushback when advertisers remind them of how little cash they have for Christmas this year.
It’s difficult to blame retailers for their efforts considering they’re struggling just as much as consumers are. Holiday sales can represent as much as 20 to 30 percent of a retailer’s typical annual sales, so their belief that aggressive strategies are every bit necessary if they want to keep afloat makes sense business-wise. Retailers prize these sales and jump out of the gate earlier each year to get them. But Kleinberger remains speculative when it comes to this strategy.
“I don’t think retailers are really benefiting,” he said. “Dollars are limited. There are too many stores chasing too few customers. It’s a market-share game. The game may be won by starting early, but extending the season doesn’t create more business for everybody. It just allows some retailers to get a jump on getting their share of spend.”
At the end of the day, companies can force it down our throats all they want, but the calendar doesn’t lie. People aren’t going to be in the holiday spirit until the holidays actually come. In a down economy, sales are going to come from the discounts on products and less so from impulse buying.
Even once Christmas is reasonably close, once the early-bird sales are gone, so are the customers. They know they can wait until prices go down further. It’s the deal that brings them in, not the artificially synthesized Christmas spirit. Extending the season seems pointless when customers are willing to wait until they get the best deal.
But if there’s one bright spot outside of all the sales tactics that encompass the Christmas season, it’s the ridiculously early release of holiday movies. Jim Carrey is going to play Scrooge in (yet another) reimagining of A Christmas Carol. It’s coming out Nov. 6.

These days, not even the bible is immune to an overly enthusiastic editor’s pen.
This is the case with Conservapedia, a wiki-based online encyclopedia designed with a pro-American, conservative Christian ideology in mind. Citing liberal bias in current translations, the site recently started a project to retranslate the Bible.
Self-heralded as “the watchdog of the internet,” Conservapedia was originally created to offset the perceived liberal bias of Wikipedia, or the rest of the “homosexual and atheist loving” information media for that matter. According to the front page of their website, the Conservative Bible Project attributes liberal bias and errors in the modern bible to three sources: lack of precision in the traditional language, lack of precision in the modern language and translation bias in converting the original language to the modern one.
The members of Conservapedia and supporters hope to remedy these errors by relieving the Bible of “liberal” words such as “government” and “gambling,” and even entire verses which they claim were either “later inserted” or simply too liberal to include.
Not only is rewriting the bible an exercise in hubris, it does little to fight the widely held stereotype that conservatives are easily offended. The Conservapedia movement needs to face the fact that many revered and ancient teachings of the Bible are liberal in nature. The folks at Conservapedia want to “express free market parables” in their retranslation, but, in terms of economics, Christianity is definitely more geared towards the socialist idea of bringing up the poor than it is to the Republican attitude of a free-market economy.
The Bible was translated by religious institutions with great care and deliberateness; a confluence of both traditional and modern languages have brought the work to its current state.
Since Obama took office, a few active members of the right wing have been involved in some rather extreme rhetorical outbursts, notably accusations of Obama being a fascist dictator with foreign interests.
Rather than being grounded in satire and exaggeration like most overboard political discourse of the past, these expressions of anger have actually been meant to be taken literally for the most part. Retranslating the modern Bible to conform with conservative beliefs, however, introduces a whole new level of arrogance and extremism.
Those unhappy with the unfavorable reputation that conservatives have had of late should stop placing blame on liberals or the media, and focus it more on initiatives such as these.
Gokul Agrawal is a sophomore majoring in business administration.
I’d say that editing translations they “don’t like” gives them NO credibility.
And this after I’ve heard christianists arguing for years that the Bible says what it means, and means what it says. Even in the many instances when it is flat-out wrong (bats = birds) or contradicts itself as in the dueling verses dealing with dead brothers; one version says it is an abomination to marry your brother’s wife and the other says a brother should marry his widowed sister-in-law and do the nasty with her.
Bonus liberal points for getting off-track and using the nutty members of a website nobody’s heard of to smear mainstream conservatism. Double bonus liberal points for trying to argue that the Bible promotes socialism and disdains freedom.
Back on topic, Ed Morrissey over at Hot Air has a good discussion of what’s wrong with the Conservapedia Bible-editing project. One of the dumber things they’re doing is trying to correct what they see as a translation bias not by going back to the original text, but by editing the English translations that they don’t like. That right there costs them a lot of credibility.
Agreed that this exercise in Bible rewriting is lame. However, Mr. Agrawal repeats a common fallacy: “Christianity is definitely more geared towards the socialist idea of bringing up the poor than it is to the Republican attitude of a free-market economy.”
Actually, Jesus Christ did not particularly concern Himself with how GOVERNMENTS treat the poor, and that is what discussions about socialism/capitalism etc. involve. Christianity is about YOU the individual, and how YOU are situated in regard to your poor neighbor (widow, orphan, etc.). It is DEFINITELY not about you telling me how to take care of the poor, or me telling you. Christianity, with its emphasis on a personal saving relationship with God, is ultimately about your individual choices, your individual life, and what you choose to make of it. Further, it could certainly be argued that the “Republican attitude of a free-market economy,” as Mr. Agrawal so awkwardly puts it, has been a greater friend to more people, economically speaking, than socialism could ever dream of.

‘Disappointing’ is the word used most often by members of the No. 10 USC men’s golf team to describe their early play.
That might seem like a misnomer, given the team’s lofty ranking and the formidable schedule they have had to navigate thus far, but USC coach Chris Zambri has built a program in which winning tournaments is the expectation.
“We need to start finishing higher in fields,” Zambri said. “Finishing in the middle of a field is not what we ever want to do. I’m looking forward to [the next tournament], and I hope these guys start playing the way I know they can.”
The Trojans have their next opportunity to please their coach this weekend at the Prestige Tournament in La Quinta, Calif. In a familiar refrain for the Trojans, the field will once again be populated by a number of top programs, including No. 5 Washington, No. 6 Stanford and No. 20 Texas Christian University.
“Coach’s expectations are obviously really high because every year he’s had a very competitive team that’s been in the top three or four in the country,” freshman Martin Trainer said. “He wants to win every tournament.”
Trainer has been a bright spot for USC this season. With a pair of top-20 finishes under his belt, the freshman has quickly adapted to the collegiate game. Now Zambri is waiting for the rest of the team to step up.
“The best thing that has happened so far is Martin has shown he can play high-level college golf,” Zambri said. “I know we have other guys who have done that or who I’m very confident will do that. If we can add another guy to the mix like we have with Martin, that’s a great thing.”
Chief among those players is junior Matthew Giles, who struggled enormously in his last tournament. The returning All-American had a strong qualifying round this week leading up to the tournament, giving his coach some reassurance.
“I’m standing on the 18th tee at Trump right now and Matthew is 6-under par at a really good golf course,” Zambri said on Wednesday. “We need a guy like Matthew to just do his thing. We need him playing like he can play.”
If Giles cannot carry the team, then the burden will likely fall on Trainer, who, in typical fashion for this team, is embarrased with his play thus far.
“Even though I have some pretty decent finishes, I feel like my game is at a much higher level than what my scores [have] shown,” he said.
Trainer said the team needs more consistent play if they want to reach their potential.
“Consistency is the most important thing,” he said. “Every single guy can go out there and shoot a good round, but it’s a team event and we need four good scores out of five. We haven’t had four good ones at the same time yet.”
The Trojans might not have played up to their capabilities yet this season but that does not mean morale is low. In fact, Zambri said the team is not even down about their mediocre results so far.
“We’d be really down if we thought we played well and finished seventh or eighth, but I don’t think we’ve played worth a darn yet,” he said.
Opening round play at the Prestige starts Sunday. The tournament will conclude Tuesday morning.

A cutting-edge development in the USC School of Social Work will give graduate students an unprecedented chance to study war-related traumas through interaction with 3-D holograms.
Since August, USC has offered a sub-concentration in military social work and veteran services, a program that emphasizes the treatment of veterans suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder and other war-related afflictions.
Once the already-approved $3.2 million grant clears Congress early next year, however, the program will feature a more interactive approach, giving students the chance to analyze hypothetical war-related traumas using holograms.
The hologram technology, which uses spinning mirrors to project a 3-D floating head into a confined area, is completely ready for use, said Anthony Hassan, inaugural director of the USC Center for Research and Innovation on Veterans and Military Families.
“The use of virtual humans is something very new within the School of Social Work,” Jose Coll, director of Military Social Work and Veteran Services at USC, wrote in an email. “And for that matter, we are the only school of social work that will be using virtual humans for training.”
The virtual human technology, co-developed by the School of Social Work and the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, is the first of its kind nationwide, Coll said. It features holographic images programmed based on behavior typically exhibited by veterans.
So far, three holographic avatars have been developed. One suffers from PTSD, one has severe depression and one has been a victim of a military sexual trauma. Hassan said the school hopes the simulations will help students later interact with real troops who have these same issues.
“We want to be the nation’s consultant as it relates to treatment of veterans and their families,” Hassan said. “And USC has developed the competence to really lead the way in this effort.”
Research gathered by the US Department of Defense shows one in five service members deployed to war in the last five years returns with PTSD or similar war-related traumas. Those with PTSD face a significantly higher likelihood of substance abuse, marital problems and suicide, and only 53 percent of these veterans and service members have sought treatment.
The School of Social Work is also working to develop an online platform that would offer similar interactive courses on the Internet, and the school hopes to extend the program to those outside of the school. The platform is expected to launch by next summer.
“We’re working with ICT to develop an online platform so a student in Minnesota could have the experience of interacting with a military patient in as realistic a way as possible using the given technology,” Hassan said.
Hassan emphasized that this component of the program is not merely an online replication of the content offered in the school’s courses.
“[The online platform] is state of the art and interactive — almost at the point of virtual reality,” Hassan said. “There’s interactive media, there’s testimonial videos from veterans … We’re implementing the avatar online so students can interact with a virtual patient from their laptop.”
Carolann Peterson, a part-time lecturer in the School of Social Work whose expertise is PTSD, said she believes the program takes the right steps toward treating soldiers with PTSD and other similar problems.
“In our new tech age, we need to take advantage of anything and everything that will assist veterans who are returning with PTSD,” Peterson said.
Peterson also said the school’s programs, along with veteran administrative programs, offer a sense of community that will help soldiers who want to return to school and readjust to civilian life.
“We want them to know that we not only welcome them back, but also that we understand them and are here to help,” Peterson said.
Using virtual humans would not surprise me as today we’ve reached at the peak as far as technology is concerned and it has made our lives very easy and effortless. Despite, the fact that it has some disadvantages too, but using it for the benefit of mankind is favorable.
Thank you Dr. England for your comments. Yes, there is a very important need across the United States and abroad for mental health providers to be current on evidence-based practices and familiar with military culture to be most effective in treating the invisible wounds of war to both veterans and their families. Are sub-concentration in the Master’s Degree of Social Work includes a course specific to military families along with three other courses related to Trauma, Health and Culture. Finally, in regards to your comment about educating and training students and professionals through a CEU or certificate program, we are going to do just that. We will have a four-course sequence certificate and CEU courses online before Aug 2010. These courses will be highly interactive with modules incorporating the latest in Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence that can be packaged in an online course. It should be noted that we are the only research university educating and training social workers and mental health providers with evidence-based curriculum delivered using virtual reality and artificial intelligence both in the classroom and online.   Thanks again.
It’s great to see that USC is developing this program because certainly, there is going to be a great need for psychotherapists who can deal effectively with war veterans and their families for years to come. However, have you also considered engaging in a nationwide continuing education program for existing therapists–perhaps some type of a certificate program that might be done online as well as with a brief residency at USC, for example? As a clinical social worker who has worked with the military and their families overseas, I recognize the importance of understanding the military culture and lifestyle. Furthermore, therapists must be kept abreast of the research—what’s most effective with individuals who present with more complex cases of PTSD, for example, than PTSD stemming from car accidents—historically the biggest source of PTSD cases. By the way, I would hope that your students find “The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Relationship: How to Support Your Partner and Keep Your Relationship Healthy” helpful. It has been endorsed by military leaders, described by the “Library Journal” as “essential for communities with returning war veterans,” and appears on the recommended reading list at Cornell Medical College’s Program for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Studies.

A multimillion-dollar grant recently awarded by the National Cancer Institute will allow USC to launch a large-scale project to compile genetic data from cancer patients in hopes of sparking more efficient cancer research.
The USC Epigenome Center, located on the Health Sciences Campus, was awarded a $10.4-million grant to work with five other institutions on a database for the next five years.

“It’s thrilling to be part of an international contortion for what will be a major resource in cancer research for many years to come,” said Peter W. Laird, director of the Epigenome Center.
Researchers have been compiling genetic data from cancer patients for decades, but the data had not been coordinated into one database until now, Laird said.
The money from the grant will allow the Epigenome Center to analyze genetic data and contribute the analysis to The Cancer Genome Atlas, a long-term project funded by the NCI. The goal of the project is to bring together data of molecular changes in more than 500 different samples of tumors and tissues from each cancer type and will form a comprehensive atlas.
“Before TCGA, many scientists studied a small number of genes in a single experiment and often performed their work on a small number of samples,” Renate Myles, an NCI spokeswoman, wrote in an email. “With this new set of grants, one of which went to Dr. Laird, the National Institutes of Health will be sponsoring a project that will look at all the genes, all the DNA in 500 tumor samples of every type of cancer the project studies.”
In particular, USC will use the grant to join John Hopkins University in collecting and analyzing data to map molecular changes in 20 main types of cancer, including breast, brain and ovarian cancer.
“It’s sort of like writing an encyclopedia of molecular cancer. It’s really an atlas for other investigators all over the world to use the molecular data,” Laird said.
The project will also involve graduate students at USC, giving them a chance to conduct research as well as access to data analysis and lab experiments that could have a national impact.
“This is a very exciting project — it’s very cutting edge. We are exposed to a very collaborative environment where we can share our ideas with many other scientists across the nation,” said Houtan Noushmehr, a Ph.D. student studying genetics, molecular and cell biology who is taking part in the project. “Our rich pool of data allows us to embrace a field of science that not a lot of students and scientists have access to.”
According to Laird, progress in the field through projects like TCGA will have vast implications for the prevention and treatment of cancer and other diseases. In some cases, doctors could even use the data from the project to identify patients with specific types of cancer that might respond better to different treatments.
Once the research is processed, the database will be available for public access which, Laird said, could become a crucial source for cancer researchers to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer.
“This will provide the most comprehensive map of molecular changes ever in place for cancer, and that information will help design new drugs and much more targeted therapy with less side effects,” he said.

Though it spent last year actively seeking out student members, Campus and Community United has been a little quieter this semester — but only in hopes of making a greater impact by focusing on six main goals.
CCU is a student group attempting to promote and preserve the interests of USC’s neighboring community, particularly as the university looks to expand and develop the University Park Campus. Last year, the group focused on generally helping the community, but this year it has developed a more strategic plan.

Jennifer Yee, alumni and parent coordinator for CCU, said she was excited about the group’s new focus.
“Previously, we concentrated a lot on outreach around a general act of principles. Right now we are realizing that it is more important to have a core group of people who are dedicated than 50 people coming in and out of the club,” said Yee, a junior majoring in comparative literature.
This year, CCU is focusing on a six-point plan that Yee said the group members feel will be more effective.
“Last year, we focused a lot on outreach around a general set of principles and ideals. Now we have made six concrete campaigns and now we’re deciding which of the campaigns will be the most feasible and have the most impact,” Yee said.
The six goals CCU plans to explore include getting students involved in USC’s Master Plan, creating a neighborhood opportunity center to foster a pipeline for economic opportunity and making more affordable transit.
With its new approach, CCU is hoping to work directly with community partners, said Daniel Wu, the group’s faculty and projects coordinator.
“The purpose of CCU is to promote neighborhood opportunity, and this year we are really hoping to expand on our coalition and develop relations with partners in order to put movement towards our goals,” Wu, a senior majoring in interdisciplinary studies, said.
Rachel Zolensky, a new member, said she liked the six-point plan the previous group members have come up with as a new focus for this year.
“I like how each goal addresses specific issues and also addresses how USC fits into each of those specific issues,” said Zolensky, a sophomore majoring in sociology.
Though the club has picked the issues it wants to focus on, it has not yet developed concrete methods for attacking these problems. They do know, however, they want support from the university community.
“We are really trying to build off of USC’s tradition of service for the community. [President Stephen B. Sample] stresses the importance of housing and jobs for USC’s surrounding neighbors and so does CCU,” Wu said.
Wu said the club is striving to get undergraduates, graduates and staff to rethink the way they see cities and neighborhoods.
Currently, members like Yee, Zolensky and Wu are appealing to the USC administration to retain the small-town feel of the University Village, rather than bringing in large businesses like those seen at the Grove and Beverly Center.
“We don’t need a mini-Grove. One of our main goals would be to survey people and get the administration to realize that there’s an appreciation for local small businesses and the USC flavor,” Yee said.
