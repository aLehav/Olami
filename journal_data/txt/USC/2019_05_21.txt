USC’s men’s and women’s track and field teams will head to Sacramento to compete in the NCAA West Preliminary Championships Thursday. The event comes on the heels of impressive performances at the Pac-12 Championships earlier this month where the women’s team won first place and the men’s team placed fifth. This is the second consecutive year the women’s team has earned the Pac-12 title for Southern California. 
Since the Pac-12 finals, several Trojans have been recognized by the conference for their stellar performances this season. 
Redshirt junior sprinter Angie Annelus was named Women’s Track Athlete of the Year. Annelus earned the most points of any single Trojan athlete at the championships by winning the 200-meter sprint event, placing second in the 100-meter dash and competing on the first-place 4x100m relay team. She is the second consecutive Trojan to win the award after Kendall Ellis received the honor last season.
Freshman hurdler and multi-event competitor Ayden Owens was named Men’s Freshman of the Year. In April, he set a USC record in the decathlon event with 8,130 points at the Bryan Clay Invitational, and currently leads the NCAA in this event.
Freshman sprinter and jumper Lanae-Tava Thomas was named Women’s Freshman of the Year. Thomas led USC freshmen in points at the Pac-12 Championships, finishing second in the 200-meter sprint and third in the 100-meter dash; he also competed on the winning 4x100m relay team.
Track and field director Caryl Smith Gilbert was also named Women’s Head Coach of the Year. This is the third time that Smith Gilbert has earned a coaching distinction and the second consecutive year that she was named Women’s Coach of the Year.
“We’re changing the culture,” Gilbert said in an interview with Pac-12 Network. “We’re developing a program, not just a team.”
At the NCAA West Preliminary Championships, Annelus and Thomas will be joined in the 100-meter dash by sophomore Twanisha “Tee Tee” Terry who qualified with a time of 11.09 seconds — the fastest qualifying time. The trio will also compete in the 200-meter event. Sophomore Kaelin Roberts, junior Kyra Constantine and freshman Bailey Lear will represent USC in the 400-meter sprint event.
In the 100-meter hurdle event, sophomore Chanel Brissett, senior Dior Hall and juniors Anna Cockrell and Mecca McGlaston will race for USC. Cockrell will also compete in the 400-meter hurdles. The Trojan women will also be competing in the 4x100m and 4x400m races, where they are favored to win.
On the men’s side, freshmen Brendon Stewart and Daniel Robinson will compete along with junior Alexander Barnum in the 100-meter dash. Robinson and Stewart will also compete in the 200-meter sprint alongside fellow freshman Eric Allen Jr. In the 800-meter sprint, junior Isaiah Jewett and freshman Sam VanDorpe will run for USC.
Freshman Omotade Ojora and senior Marquis Morris will be competing in the 110-meter hurdle event while sophomore Cameron Samuel will run in the 400-meter hurdle event after having qualified with the fastest time.
 After competing in the Pac-12 Championship, the women’s team currently ranks second in the nation while the men’s team ranks 10th. They look to continue their successful seasons at the NCAA West Preliminary Championships in order to qualify for finals, which will be held in June in Austin, Texas.
The Women of Troy will begin their quest to repeat as national champions after narrowly securing the title by a single point last year. 
“It is great to know that we can [win the national championship], and we’ll use that as fuel to go forward,” Gilbert said. “But as I said before, last year was last year. It’s 2019 now.”

After last week’s NBA Draft Lottery, in which the New Orleans Pelicans improbably came away with the first overall pick, teams are turning their attention toward whom — not where — they’ll be picking.
The NBA Draft Combine, which took place Wednesday through Sunday night, served as a platform for draft prospects to showcase their talent to teams across the league — whether to establish themselves as a top pick or to convince teams to take a chance on them at the back end of the draft.  
USC has two players with a reasonable chance of being selected in the NBA Draft June 20.
One-and-done guard Kevin Porter Jr., who is leaving USC after his freshman year, is predicted to fall somewhere in the middle of the first round, with the potential to become a lottery pick in the first round’s top 14.
“[Porter] is really talented,” ESPN NBA Draft expert Mike Schmitz said. “I think he’s one of the more talented scorers in the draft, if you’re looking at sheer talent.” 
Porter had a chance to show off his top-tier scoring potential at the Draft Combine over the weekend. He reportedly met with at least 15 different NBA teams during the event.  
However, Porter’s scoring ability is not the focus of the buzz surrounding his draft stock and potential landing spots, however. After being scrutinized throughout his year at USC for his immaturity and for a midseason suspension due to “conduct issues,” teams will try to assess Porter’s character before taking a chance on the promising shooting guard. 
“For him, it’s about the interview process, answering why he had such an uneven season at USC, why he got suspended, why he wasn’t able to show much consistency,” Schmitz said. “That’s what teams want to figure out about him, because some days he looks like a top-five pick, and some days he looks like a guy that you don’t want to invest your draft pick in.”
Porter seemed to understand the speculation surrounding his character at the Combine and pointedly attempted to ease those concerns.
“I have a lot of growth left,” Porter said to reporters when asked about expectations surrounding his maturity in the NBA. “I feel like everything that happened, and all the things I’ve been through in my life, I’ve been growing as a person. I’ve been improving all my life … I’ve got to show my character and everything so [teams] can trust me. As a player and off the court.”
Despite concerns over Porter’s conduct, he remains one of the better players in the draft. ESPN lists Porter as the 14th best player available. 
Porter, for one, seems not to have lost any confidence, even after a rocky season as a Trojan.
“A lot of people say I’m one of the most talented players in the draft, but they have a lot of problems with my character,” Porter said. “Before everything that happened, I was considered a top-five [pick]. I feel like I’m still a top-five [pick].”
Porter isn’t the only Trojan who has garnered the teams’ attention ahead of the draft. Bennie Boatwright, a 6-foot-10 guard who played for the Trojans from 2015 to 2019, is also hoping to hear his name called by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.
Boatwright led USC in both 3-point percentage (42.9%) and points per game (18.2) in his final collegiate season.
“Any time you have size and shooting, I think you’re going to get looks,” Schmitz said. “He strikes me as a guy who will probably earn a two-way contract, play a lot in the G-League [the NBA’s minor league organization] and then go from there.”
Porter and Boatwright are likely to be selected at very different stages in the draft and will embark on different paths to the NBA. For now, however, the two former Trojans can only try to impress teams as much as possible before draft night in hopes of earning their spot at the sport’s highest level.

The USC baseball team displayed a consistent offensive performance this weekend, producing a total of 25 runs in the team’s series win against Oregon.
Both teams entered the series near the bottom of the Pac-12 standings, and the Trojans celebrated the team’s outgoing veterans on Sunday’s Senior Day.
The series opener was highlighted by an offensive outburst that ended in a 10-6 victory. 
The Trojans scored 3 runs in the first inning with RBIs from freshman infielder Clay Owens, sophomore designated hitter Trevor Halsema, and senior infielder Chase Bushor. 
In the third inning, USC knocked in 2 runs with home runs from Owens and junior outfielder Brady Shockey. Owens finished the game with three RBIs and Shockey with two. 
Junior pitcher Connor Lunn took advantage of the significant run support and pitched 6.2 dominant innings. Lunn shut out the Ducks through the first six frames, allowing 2 runs in the seventh before being removed for sophomore left-hander John Beller, who threw 1.1 perfect innings. 
The Ducks tried to catch up, but it was a bit too late. The visiting team scored 4 runs in the ninth inning, but the Trojans’ early success proved to be too large a deficit to overcome. 
“We hit the ball hard all night,” Hubbs said. “It gave us a cushion and we were able to use that to our advantage.”
The Trojans fell to the Ducks on Saturday, despite scoring 7 runs. Oregon scored 4 runs in the first inning and continued to add to its lead as the game progressed. 
The Trojans attempted to counter with rallies of their own, but the Ducks sealed the game with a 3-run home run in the seventh inning. Oregon took game two by a score of 10-7.
Junior outfielder Blake Sabol finished the game with two RBIs and two hits, including a solo home run in the fifth inning. Bushor added two RBIs of his own with a double down the left field line in the eighth.
The Trojans clinched the series win with a commanding 8-2 victory on Sunday. USC took an early 3-run lead on a 2-run single from sophomore shortstop Ben Ramirez in the second inning. Ramirez would finish the game going 2-3 with two RBIs and one run scored.
Oregon countered with 2 runs of its own in the top of the third, but those were the only that the Ducks produced for the remainder of the game. Trojan sophomore pitcher Kyle Hurt was a major problem for the Ducks, pitching six innings and earning the win. 
Hurt gave up just one hit and three walks, striking out seven batters.
Senior infielder Brandon Perez provided 2 insurance runs for USC in the sixth inning with a double down the left field line to make the score 5-2. Perez came out strong, finishing with two doubles and two RBIs in his final home game.
Junior outfielder Matthew Acosta effectively put the game out of reach with a 3-run homer in the seventh inning. 
USC’s bullpen held the lead for the remainder of the game, ending the home schedule on a positive note. 
“I am happy that we got a win on my last day at USC,” Perez said. “It definitely gives us a big confidence booster [going into next week].”
Prior to the series win, USC narrowly defeated LMU with a late inning comeback led by Perez. Perez drove in the go-ahead run in the ninth inning with a single up the middle, making the score 3-2. 
The Trojans held the lead in the bottom of the ninth and split the season series with the Lions with one victory each.
“It was a struggle offensively for us,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after the matchup with LMU. “I was real pleased with our ability to stick with it.”
After facing UCI May 2nd. the Trojans will travel to Corvallis to face off against Oregon State Thursday. The Beavers are ranked 12th in the nation, currently hold a 35-16-1 overall record and stand at 20-6 in the Pac-12. 
The team will play Thursday and Friday at 6 p.m., and the series will conclude with a noon Saturday game at Goss Stadium.

The smell of El Mercadito de Los Angeles is like a sonorous crescendo in a symphony. Frying oil and corn husks perfume the encircling parking lot and alleyways, a tease of the building’s contents, an unwavering flag of identity for the surrounding neighborhood. Within El Mercadito, the neutral notes that were so potent outside are buried under the bouncing scents of roasted meat, melted butter and spice mixes, even leather and straw. Each stall offers its own signature smell in the parade of delicious, overwhelming scents. To some, it’s a foreign olfactory planet. To others, it’s home. 
Growing up, the only thing I knew about my paternal grandfather was the packages of chile-dusted mango that he would send twice a year to our doorstep. They glistened with flecks of rock salt and sugar, dusted with a deep red powder that rested on fingers and lips. 
Tucked in a thin hallway next to a fleet of paint buckets filled with mole was an array of conspicuously bright red chile mango. 
“We have six flavors,” a vendor, Gloria, tells me in Spanish. 
She bounces around me and into the small space where the cash register is located. Her small frame, accentuated slightly by a bright red, green and white apron, is almost swallowed by the sweets around her, making her fade into the shelves of Mexican candy. Almost everywhere I look, I am greeted by a warm rainbow of wrappers. As she speaks, Gloria slows her words for me. I was grateful for the gesture, even though I couldn’t find the precise sentence in my blunted Spanish to tell her that. 
Gloria points across the hallway to an older woman standing behind a glass counter with more sweets, also adorned in bright red, green and white. “She does the gummy mangoes and worms with our own chile spices.”
I buy a mixed pound of every offering. She throws handfuls of each flavor into a plastic bag, eyeballing each fistful for a moment before adding it to the bag. As she weighs my bag, she picks out one plump gummy worm and tosses it back into the pile. She was off by half an ounce.
“I’ve been working here for a year,” she says. “I needed a job. My whole family needs to work.” 
Two men appear next to me, eyeing the chile mango. I move out of the way so she can fill their bags. She talks to them too quickly for me to understand, but I can tell it’s a cordial, familiar conversation. 
Most conversations within El Mercadito have that tone. People here know each other, their orders and the vendors. It’s a place for lunch regulars and weekly grocery shoppers. There is no confusion about where this space fits in the community, it is the community.
I ask about the business. 
“We used to have a lot more customers,” Gloria says, once the other customers clear. “But people are moving out. It’s too expensive or they’re scared. They don’t want to be deported.”
The mercadito, though bustling with smells, is not bustling with people. It feels stuck, steadfast in heritage, full of the goods that fuel a Mexican community like the one in East Los Angeles. It has importance. It has history. And it may be dying, victim to the tidal waves of gentrification sweeping the neighborhood. El Mercadito is faced with an impossible decision: adapt and lose its culture, or stand resilient and eventually perish. 
Gloria smiles after we finish our conversation. She wishes me luck on my writing.
Before I leave, I double back and buy another pound of chile mango.

“They gon’ feel this one,” sings Tyler, the Creator on the opening track of his fifth studio album, “IGOR.”
Prior to the LP’s release, Tyler took to Twitter and Instagram to warn his fans: “This is not Cherry Bomb. This is not Flower Boy. Don’t go into this expecting a rap album. Don’t go into this expecting any album.” 
As promised, “IGOR” takes listeners on a genre-bending journey, one with a narrative completely different from the artist’s previous projects. Experimental in its truest form, the project follows the rapper on a journey to make sense of love and heartbreak. 
A follow-up to 2017’s “Flower Boy,” “IGOR” is sprinkled with features with artists like Kanye West and Playboi Carti that add  creative touches without disrupting the flow of the record. A$AP Rocky spits on “NEW MAGIC WAND,” and Pharrell William joins in on the closing ballad, “ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?” Comedian Jarrod Carmichael plays the voice of reason on “WHAT’S GOOD,” where his remarks are sparse yet poignant: “I don’t know what’s harder, letting go or just being okay with it.” 
The dark and twisted mutterings of “IGOR” shed light on a side of Tyler his fans have never seen before, one that downplays his indomitable personality and elucidates his insecurities, inner turmoil and conflicting feelings about love. The project is decidedly indecisive, and the path it takes is not only unpredictable and disorganized, but also unabashedly passionate. 
“I THINK” is groovy and upbeat, with a slick beat switch that leads into a funk jam. On the stuttering, offbeat “A BOY IS A GUN.”, Tyler is vulnerable and pissed: “You so motherfucking dangerous.” 
“GONE,GONE / THANK YOU” features some of the album’s most honest, heart wrenching bars: “Keep it going / The Band-Aid is falling off now / And now I’m scarred for life.”
Contrary to his previous works, “IGOR” focuses on sonic texture over song structure. The album is rife with baselines and out-of-key synths, with splashes of funk percussion and piano. The album is disjointed yet impeccable, pulling the unsuspecting listener through pleasantly surprising twists and turns. Vocals are often buried under an avalanche of arrangements, an interesting stylistic swerve for an artist whose strengths lie largely in his creative raps. 
In fact, Tyler raps less than ever before on this album. Critics might say he’s sacrificing authenticity to appeal to the masses, but nothing about this album says sellout. Rather, it says the opposite. Tyler, the Creator has undergone an artistic evolution, moving further and further into his own lane and redefining the bounds of hip-hop.
“IGOR” undeniably marks a new age in Tyler’s artistic self-conception. He has, to some extent, traded in his outlandish provocations for meaning and substance, without giving up the trademark unorthodoxy of the Tyler, the Creator brand. “IGOR” feels symbolic of the fact that Tyler has transcended the “rapper” label and now exists in a space beyond  genre and convention. 
“IGOR” will not be remembered for its narrative or songwriting. The lyrics can be highly repetitive and are more often than not masked by music. Those who came to hear Tyler frantically spit rhymes should look to his previous work. 
Instead, “IGOR” is a collection of sounds, scenes and memories carefully put together to evoke raw emotion. The project is emblematic of Tyler’s personal and professional growth and sets a high standard for his next project.

The College Board recently announced plans to assign a new “adversity score” to students’ SAT scores, contextualizing their socioeconomic disparities. The score will be determined by 31 factors, including the crime rate and poverty level of a student’s high school and neighborhood. 
While some argue that the score reduces students’ lived experience to mere data points, its implementation is actually a step in the right direction. USC, which remains at the center of the FBI’s college admissions bribery scheme investigation, must embrace the College Board’s adversity score to demonstrate its commitment to upholding fair admissions practices and prioritizing socioeconomic diversity.
In 2017, an investigation by The New York Times revealed just how poorly USC fares in indicators of socioeconomic diversity. According to The Times, 14% of all USC students come from the top 1% of the income scale, while just 4.9% of students come from the bottom 20%.
Some universities have overcome similar gaps in income and racial diversity by implementing the adversity score. At Yale, the score was implemented as part of a beta test by the College Board and nearly doubled the number of low-income and first-generation admitted students to 20%, according to The Wall Street Journal. At Florida State University, the score helped boost nonwhite enrollment by 5%. 
USC is in desperate need of similar improvements in its admission processes. The current process at most major universities is inherently unfair, benefiting applicants who can afford and have access to college counseling services, standardized test preparation courses and better academic  resources. The new adversity score would take these disparities into consideration, giving students from lower-income backgrounds a fairer chance against their more  advantaged peers.
Furthermore, increasing the diversity of USC’s student population benefits the entire campus community. By enrolling students from a variety of backgrounds, the University can foster an inclusive environment where students can learn about cultures, ideas and perspectives outside of their own. It can show students who grew up wealthy the reality of an America where millions live in poverty. If the school’s student body fails to reflect society’s basic economic realities, then the University is failing to prepare its students to live in a socioeconomically diverse America. 
Incorporating the adversity score would also be a significant step to show USC’s progress in reforming the flawed admission processes uncovered in the college admissions bribery case. By showing its commitment to admitting a diverse class of students, the University can begin to rectify its marred image and account for its mistakes. 
Some argue that the adversity score dehumanizes applicants by oversimplifying the complexities of students’ lives into mere sociological data points. Such criticism is valid; the adversity score will never be able to capture the true scope of an individual student’s hardship. Significant forms of trauma, such as domestic violence, abuse and racism, are not factored into the score.
But implementing the adversity score doesn’t mean the University will forgo its holistic admission policy. Standardized testing is just one of many factors USC considers when reviewing applications, and the adversity score is one small part of it. The Common Application includes spaces for students to inform universities about any hardship they may have faced — admissions reviewers should continue to consider information in these spaces in tandem  with the adversity score. It would be unfair to let this number alone define a student’s potential, just as it is unfair to let only a test score do the same. 
In a recent interview with The Times, USC President-elect Carol Folt said she wants to ensure prospective students and parents aren’t skeptical of USC’s admissions.
“I think what we have to say is we’re doing everything we can to make sure that [the admissions] process is really fair,” Folt said. 
If Folt’s words are to be taken seriously, and if the University is to regain the trust of the campus community, then USC must consider the College Board’s new adversity score in its admission process.

According to results from the 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 23% of undergraduate female students have experienced nonconsensual sexual touching during their time at USC. With this statistic in mind, Now What, an organization founded by five USC alumnae, is calling for the Engemann Student Health Center to provide students with rape kits and a sexual assault nurse. 
“I tried to get maybe 100 signatures and posted it to two Facebook groups, and it got over 1,000 signatures in over a week and a half,” said Cara Straus, one of Now What’s co-founders.
Inspired by a similar petition at the University of North Texas, the alumnae originally started the petition for a class project, but hope it will bring change to USC.
USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services Director Brenda Ingram said the University is home to RSVP, which provides a range of resources for survivors including counseling, Title IX services and other psychosocial care. According to Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman, Engemann and the Department of Public Safety also offer free transportation to the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center, the closest place for survivors to get rape kits. 
However, without offering rape kits on campus, some students like Seanna Latiff, a rising sophomore majoring in art, say that USC is failing to provide for survivors.
“I think [the petition] is very necessary, and it shows that USC is not offering a system of support to survivors and instead is proving to be negligent to the fact that there is rape occurring on campus,” Latiff said. “They have the ability to support the victims; instead, they’d rather have them sent to Santa Monica alone, which is not anything anybody actually wants to do.”
Van Orman and Ingram said the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center offers a level of care and expertise that cannot be replicated at Engemann. 
“I really view rape treatment centers as highly, highly specialized, and we’re fortunate that the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center is actually probably the leading center in the nation,” Van Orman said. “I want [every] student who is in need of these services to have access to the best possible care team of people with the best expertise and that is not something we can build here.”
According to Straus, the problem is one of accessibility. She said having a full-time sexual assault nurse who can provide trauma care and administer rape kits should be a priority.
“The side we’re fighting for is [having more resources] on campus,” Straus said.
Located about 30 minutes from campus, the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center features a secluded floor that specializes in support and care for victims. It is also connected to an emergency room to treat injuries incurred by survivors — a resource Engemann lacks. Additionally, the center is one of the only in the nation that stores forensic evidence indefinitely. 
“I think when students are asking for rape kits, they see the rape kit but don’t necessarily see all the other stuff — the processes, the practices, the procedures that go along with making a rape kit,” Ingram said. 
According to Ingram, Los Angeles County law establishes specific and strict criteria for rape kits and the institutions that can administer them. She said the most difficult requirement for Engemann to meet is access to acute medical care because it is not part of a hospital.  
Latiff said she believes the investment in gaining the ability to administer rape kits on campus is worth it. 
“I think we all wonder how USC prioritizes its money,” Latiff said. Latiff said she believes the university should put more money toward student health, particularly for female students. 
Straus said she is particularly concerned with the extra time traveling to Santa Monica takes from the 72-hour window survivors have to get a rape kit and students’ desire to be treated on campus.
“A lot of students will be hesitant to go because of the distance or the travel,” Straus said.
While Ingram and Van Orman don’t believe Engemann will offer rape kits in the near future, they are hopeful about a new RSVP initiative.
“We will bring on advocates to accompany survivors to crisis centers,” Ingram said. 
She also said the advocates would facilitate student’s aftercare and help guide them through the University’s resources.
Straus said Now What is planning on sending the petition to faculty, deans, Engemann officials and other USC administrators. 
“We have a great connection with one of the best treatment centers in the country, but we are also one of the largest research institutions, so there should be [more resources] on campus,” Straus said.

Now What, an organization created by five USC alumnae, started an online petition in early May demanding that the University provide better sexual violence protection services. The petition specifically requests that the University hire a sexual assault nurse examiner and educate the student body on the available resources on campus.
USC should not only respond to this petition and meet Now What’s demands, but also proactively provide further resources, such as rape kits, and create a rape treatment center on campus. 
The organization was originally a project created in “Designing Media and Communication Projects for Social Change,” a course offered at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Through their course research, Now What’s founders discovered that current sexual violence prevention resources are both inadequate and largely unknown to the student body. This inspired them to start the petition, which has since amassed over 1,500 signatures. 
USC has seen multiple sexual harassment and assault allegations against a number of University professors, doctors and administrators, including former Keck School of Medicine dean Rohit Varma, former campus gynecologist George Tyndall and former social work assistant professor Erick Guerrero.
While the University has taken some steps in the right direction since these allegations surfaced, it has not done nearly enough to adequately protect survivors of sexual violence or display its commitment to preventing sexual violence. 
The University still does not provide rape kits, a forensic exam that preserves possible DNA evidence and is an important form of medical care for survivors. USC also needs to hire certified medical professionals with expertise in treating sexual assault survivors. Although the Engemann Student Health Center now offers chaperones for all medical examinations and the University has created an online reporting service for sexual assault victims, both initiatives merely react to allegations against Tyndall and don’t address the full scope of sexual violence at USC. 
An online survey conducted by Now What revealed that 86% of current students believe that resources are inefficient and 43% are unaware of campus resources. Students need to be educated about the resources available to them on campus, and it is up to Engemann to spread that information. This could be done through an online platform, or by requiring students to take an online course. 
“Think About It,” an online program that all USC students are required to complete, encourages students to reflect critically on topics related to consent, dating violence and bystander information. However, the course is currently unengaging and ineffective at imparting lasting lessons to students. Furthermore, the course is a generic one used at multiple universities. USC needs to create a separate, concise platform dedicated solely to educating the student body about campus resources and protocols for survivors of sexual violence.
USC must also implement a rape treatment center on campus. Sexual violence is experienced at a higher rate on college campuses, yet the closest rape treatment center to the University Park Campus, the UCLA Rape Treatment Center, is 13 miles away in Santa Monica. This is a major inconvenience that directly inhibits students’ access to care.
Rape treatment centers aren’t uncommon on or near college campuses. Peer institutions across the country such as Boston University and the University of Illinois have rape treatment centers on campus. 
Not only would a rape treatment center help survivors, but it would also help solve a major public safety issue. 
Rape kits are necessary to hold sexual violence offenders accountable for their actions so they don’t repeat their crimes and are discouraged from committing them in the first place. This is a unique safety concern for college campuses, given that 66% of perpetrators in college are repeat offenders, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
Until the University responds proactively to student complaints by educating the student body about campus resources and providing rape kits and sexual assault nurses, sexual assault survivors at USC won’t get the justice they deserve. 
Now is the time for USC to stand in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault rather than work against them.

USC paid former Keck School of Medicine dean Carmen Puliafito over $1.8 million following his termination from the University, according to University tax filings disclosed this week.
The Chronicle of Higher Education, which first reported the University payments, stated that USC paid Puliafito $850,000 in severance along with $624,000 in base pay, $124,000 in bonus pay and a remaining $206,215 in unidentified payments. A University spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times that Puliafito’s bonus was paid in accordance with his employment contract. 
While the dean resigned in 2016, he was not officially barred from campus and stripped of his tenure until a settlement was reached in Fall 2017 following a Los Angeles Times investigation into the matter that summer. The settlement included the $1.8 million payment, according to this year’s tax forms, which are required to be publicly disclosed due to USC’s status as a nonprofit organization. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said the previous University administration was responsible for the settlement payments.
“In 2017, the University’s previous administration reached a settlement agreement with Carmen Puliafito to resign from his faculty position, give up his tenure and separate from the University,” USC wrote. “Since that time, USC has implemented significant reforms regarding what corrective actions must be taken when any employee violates university policies and the procedures that must be followed regarding their separation.”
The L.A. Times investigation uncovered footage and photographs of Puliafito smoking methamphetamine and ingesting ecstasy in various settings, including on campus. 
Former president C. L. Max Nikias said USC was not aware of Puliafito’s illegal activities prior to his resignation. Following the Times report, the University hired former U.S. attorney Debra Wong Yang to lead an internal investigation. According to the Times, the findings of Yang’s report have been kept secret for two years. 
Puliafito, who was stripped of his medical license by the Medical Board of California last summer, has a court hearing scheduled next year to determine if he can return to treating patients, the Times reported.

The USC Institute of Armenian Studies hosted scholars, artists, musicians, politicians and other prominent Armenian figures for its fifth annual Innovate Armenia festival Saturday. Attendees were able to learn about Armenian culture through discussions, artistic and musical performances and exhibitions. 
“In order for Armenia to develop democratically, thrive economically and for the diaspora to have a tangible source of connection to a language, a land, a way of life, it is imperative that the two understand each other better,” said IAS associate director Syuzanna Petrosyan. 
While panelists discussed politics inside Bovard Auditorium, chess players ran competitions and musicians performed outside at Founders Park for festival goers. 
The Nur Qanon Ensemble, a musical group of four young women whose work was shown at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival last year, performed traditional Armenian folk songs, and the Element Band performed “Sound Stories,” an hour-long rendition of classical Armenian music accompanied by spoken-word prose. 
Booths at Founders Park offered information about the Institute, their research and participating nonprofit organizations, such as the Armenia Tree Project, which aims to limit deforestation in rural Armenia. 
This year’s theme focused on old and new identities of the Armenian diaspora, ranging from presentations on  history, memory and genealogy to discussions on current technological innovations and politics in the Republic of Armenia. 
Last spring, the country underwent a “Velvet Revolution” — a series of peaceful anti-government protests led by parliament member Nikol Pashinyan. After the protests, Pashinyan was elected as the country’s prime minister.
Innovate Armenia hosted Pashinyan via a live Skype call to discuss life in post-revolution Armenia and his goals for the nation moving forward. 
“Today, Armenia is by and large considered a free and democratic country, and I think it is one of the important achievements of the revolution,” Pashinyan said. “The general goal of our government … is to encourage people, to trigger a burst of new talents.”
Pashinyan said he hopes to create a new Armenia that can address its previous challenges, such as political corruption and unstable political infrastructure.
“Our main challenge is to address the controversies we have from the past,” Pashinyan said. “To create [a] new Armenia, we have to understand what happened to Armenia since our country’s independence [from the Soviet Union in 1991] — why we failed in creating a strong, competitive and contemporary country.”
Pashinyan said he was hopeful for the country’s future.
“I am sure we are going in the right way,” Pashinyan said. “[We are] fully devoted to the principles of democracy, of rule of law, of transparency and for human rights.”
Following Pashinyan, intellectuals, politicians, historians and creative thinkers discussed topics like the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and how it has shaped contemporary identity, the diaspora and government policies across sectors like healthcare, technology development and education. 
Shushan Karapetian, the Institute’s deputy director, said the foundation for rebuilding and innovating Armenia rests on its historical status as the Silicon Valley of the Soviet Union. 
“We have the infrastructure for sciences and technology,” Karapetian said. “For a landlocked country, technology is the way out.”
A final panel discussion about the Armenian diaspora concluded the festival. Panelists included Secretary of the Security Council Armen Grigorian, First Deputy Minister of Nature Protection Irina Ghaplanyan, Former Deputy Prime Minister Vache Gabrielyan and Bishop Bagrat Galstanyan. They said the most significant way the diaspora can help Armenia grow is through engagement.
“What we need from the diaspora is knowing about Armenia, and I think it’s a two-way street,” Ghaplanyan said. “We need to communicate better as to what challenges we have and how we can solve [them] together.”
