Air, the French electronic duo that never fails to deliver great albums, has released yet another compelling record in its already impressive repertoire — Love 2.
Through the years, Air has solidified itself as one of the most interesting minimalist electronica acts, and with Love 2, it’s apparent Air will carry that banner for years to come. But because of its niche market and audience, no song by the band will ever become an anthem for any generation, nor will its members ever be considered poets or artists that create art beyond them, at least from a mainstream point of view.

Air creates songs that turn into ambience; it creates certain moods and feelings, and turns into the perfect elevator music you want to put on when you are just relaxing in your room. You can listen to Air while doing your homework, or even while you write articles for the school newspaper. Although the music lingers in your subconscious, it acts as mere background noise rather than a tune that you crave.
The band uses anything — from grand pianos, bells, conga drums, string sections and guitars to anything related to a synthesizer — to create tunes that could be put on repeat without tiring out the listener.
As its name wittingly suggests, Air uses a lot of reverberation and space to play with sounds and to create soothing ambience in each song. With the release of its fifth album, Air gives both old and new fans even more reasons to love what these guys do.
Although the album as a whole is satisfying, Love 2 does unfortunately contain some of the most forgettable songs ever to be released by the duo. Love 2 starts out very well with spacey, dreamlike tracks “Do The Joy” and “Love.” On these two particular tracks, the duo just sticks to what it does best and brings overly produced tracks with catchy hooks that resonate well in social ambience.
Sadly, midway through the album, Air’s reverb begins to fall flat. “Missing The Light of The Day” combines two things that make perfect sense on paper, but truly sound horrible in practice: futuristic sounds and beats you would hear on a Kraftwerk album combined with more modern-sounding auto-tuned vocals. As Jay-Z once said, auto-tune is dead, and if it isn’t, it truly should be. This could be one of Air’s worst songs, and it is not a fun experiment listening to it.
Another low point on the album is “Tropical Disease,” a track that starts out marvelously well with a crisp clear piano and a muted trumpet, but turns into a Japanese cartoon theme song followed by a pretty annoying recorder. This tune is definitely another experiment for the duo and really brings the record down.
The album picks up toward the end, however, and leaves listeners on a better note. “Sing Sang Sung” and “You Can Tell It To Everybody” return to the essential sound of the band that fans know and love.
The last track on the album, “African Velvet,” is very reminiscent of Moby’s newest album, Wait For Me. Although it is on relatively newer grounds for Air, it passes with flying colors because it lacks a true hook and plays with listeners’ expectations. Air should look for these musical segues instead of completely abandoning its style and going for a sound that is out of  its spectrum.
Air’s Love 2 delivers an album that fans have been waiting for  since the release of Pocket Symphony; however, the record also shows  that the style that made the duo famous does not permit much room for vast experimentation.
For the band to grow in popularity, it would have to abandon what it does best, which is create off-beat, celestial sounds full of quirks and nuances. It would be better for Air to ignore mass stardom and maintain its minimalistic roots in order to become an unconventional yet true legend within its specialized audience.

Stepping into USC Fisher Museum of Art is like stepping into another world — literally. Displays of galaxies, planets, celestial bodies and cosmic wonders frame the walls of the entryway. Set to the backdrop of an ethereal melody, all of the senses are stimulated at once. From the fresh blast of air conditioning to the vibrant colors of the artwork to the hypnotic quality of the music, one is transported not only to another world, but to another frame of mind. That’s the point.
Travels and Wanderings, an eclectic display of artist Victor Raphael’s work over the last 30 years, is a collection of works that embodies just that.
On the road · Victor Raphael’s Travels and Wanderings showcases the artist’s collection of work from the past 30 years. The exhibit is on display at USC Fisher Museum of Art until Dec. 19. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
“We focused in on key pieces and theories that filled out this theme — literal and metaphoric travel,” Raphael said. He noted that he worked closely with the museum’s director and curator to select the works.
“In a sense, when you talk about a person’s travels and wanderings, it can really apply to all of us. We’re all on this journey of life; our wanderings are tangents that become enriching [and] inform our next move, direction,” he said.
The collection centers around many of Raphael’s own travels and wanderings: The Louvre in Paris, the juxtaposition of traditional and modern Japanese culture in Tokyo, Kyoto and Hiroshima, Martha’s Vineyard, Alaska, the Getty in Los Angeles — to name a few. Wherever he goes, Raphael always has art on his mind.
“I’m always thinking about doing work,” Raphael said. “I try to take my cameras with me whenever I can. That’s what made Polaroid so special — it was the thing before digital technology where I could see [an image] on the spot.”
Raphael’s work is unique in that it defies traditional boundaries. Instead of using a Polaroid or a print on its own, Raphael applies embellishing techniques such as gold and nettle leaf painting and chromogenic print to add a whole new dimension to his art. The result is stunning, especially in his space collection: bedazzled galaxies, asteroids like scattered jewels, stars sparkling gold.
“I think it’s cool the way he can manipulate one image and make it look completely different,” said Lauren Goehner, a junior majoring in psychology who works at the museum.
Her favorite pieces are Raphael’s Polaroids, clever artistic snapshots placed throughout the museum, also enhanced with the gold nettle leaf and chromogenic print, which give them a metallic quality.
“They become hybrids, combinations of different mediums [where] one informs the other,” Raphael said. “At one level, I’m really interested in challenging all these categories, that something is either this or that, by combining media in a way to create a reaction in the viewer that causes them to take pause to consider what it is and how it is speaking to them.”
Zak Cheney-Rice, a senior majoring in cinema-television who also works at the museum, likes Raphael’s “Space Fields” portion of the collection for this reason.
“It’s like something from this universe, but made up at the same time,” Cheney-Rice said.
Raphael also implements a variety of multimedia and interactive technologies, including film and computers, as part of his art.
“[There have been] paradigm shifts with digital technology. At the beginning, people were very resistant to these forms, but they have to understand this is all a continuum of evolution and progress. It’s an exciting part of being an artist in this time, not only reflecting the time we live in, but times of media and new tools,” Raphael said.
In Travels and Wanderings, several films are interspersed throughout the collection. One compilation of images set to poetry depicts a tribute to the life of one of Raphael’s favorite artists, Jackson Pollock. Another shows the crowded airport from his travels in Japan. Still others are flashes of color and sounds destined to lead to sensory overload.
Two films are projected onto large screens and given private viewing rooms: One portraying outer-worldly images of space and another a soothing, lulling shoot of Raphael’s time in Alaska, with  a frosty gray ocean and glacial ice caps falling gracefully into the sea.
“It’s an immersive experience because the rooms have been designed to sit and watch the pieces versus the video monitors that address the subject matter with the series,” Raphael said.
In addition to the films, there is also “Space Fields,” where viewers use a computer to click through a variety of Raphael’s pieces. All of these elements of his artwork have “played out to what I think is a unique body of work, not quite like anyone else’s,” Raphael said. “I’m not bragging, it brings on a new set of challenges. [My art] is hard to categorize sometimes.”
Yet Raphael said his art is about “resisting categories,” and he expressed his desire for his work to be “freer of those definitions.”
His brilliant combination of photography, painting and interactive media certainly accomplishes this goal, and inspires the viewer to contemplate his or her own travels and wanderings.
“What we do as artists is try to create a world of our own. I really feel that world is pretty evident to me, and I hope to the audience as well,” Raphael said.
He stressed that as an artist, he is interested in “finding beauty,” and in “the little details that reveal something divine or wonderful.”
“There is plenty of horror and death and destruction in the world,” Raphael said. “I’m trying to find some place that resonates more deeply in the soul … that tells us maybe things are all right; something that speaks to people on different levels and in different ways.”
At his exhibit in USC’s Fisher Museum of Art, one can find just the place.

After a long hiatus, the USC men’s tennis team is ready to take the courts today in Tulsa, Okla. for the All-American Championships tournament.
“It’s been kind of a long layoff so it feels good to get back and play matches,” sophomore Steve Johnson said.

The tournament involves singles and doubles rounds, but no team competition. To qualify, a player must be previously ranked by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. The top 44 singles teams and 21 doubles teams automatically qualify for the main draw.
For the Trojans, No. 3 senior Robert Farah and No. 18 Johnson received automatic qualifying bids in singles. The No. 3 pair received an automatic bid in doubles as well.
“It’s the last year I’ll be able to play this tournament so I want to finish my All-American college career on good terms,” Farah said.
There is, however, another opportunity for singles and doubles players to qualify for the main draw. Starting Monday, the University of Tulsa held the All-American qualifying rounds, which gave 128 additional singles players an opportunity to qualify for the main draw, with 16 players receiving a bid. On the doubles side, 64 teams participated in the qualifying tournament, with eight moving on to the main draw.
Yesterday, No. 99 sophomore Matt Kecki and No. 49 junior Jaak Poldma earned a spot in the singles main draw after defeating their respective opponents.
Poldma defeated Andrew Crone of North Carolina in the first round 7-5, 6-4. He then defeated Nebraska’s Calin Paar 6-3, 6-4 in the second round, and secured his entry in the main draw with a smooth 6-3, 6-2 victory over Tucker Vorster of Ole Miss.
Kecki narrowly escaped the first round with a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Ohio State’s Devin McCarthy. In round two he handily defeated Michigan’s Evan King 6-3, 6-1 and made things look even easier in the third round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Adrian Forberg of Ole Miss.
Sophomore Daniel Nguyen was eliminated in the third round; Freshman JT Sundling and senior Jason McNaughton were eliminated in the first round.
“Jaak and Kecki both played great and I really think D. Nguyen could have won [Wednesday],” USC coach Peter Smith said. “He’s a lot stronger than last year.”
Kecki and Poldma also received an entry in the doubles main draw after a team withdrew from the tournament. They were set to play in the final qualifying match Wednesday afternoon when they received the news.
A combination of this week’s success and previous rankings has earned four Trojans spots in today’s tournament, an impressive feat according to Smith.
“It’s a great showing to have four guys in the main draw,” Smith said. “It’s basically made up of the top 64 players in the country and to have four of our guys in that top 64 says a lot.”
The players are also confident in their ability to perform well this week.
“I’ve done well at this tournament the last two years so I’m going to go out there and do my best,” Farah said. “My goal is to win the tournament.”
His doubles partner, Johnson, agreed.
“I’d like to do well and win a bunch of matches so I can look forward to what’s on tap next for us,” Johnson said.
Farah and Johnson also expect to have success as a doubles team.
“Our chance of winning has gotta be good,” Johnson said. “We’re playing much better because I was new last year and had some things to work on, but I feel like we have a good chance to do really well.”
Overall, Smith said the national championship team has a different air about them than teams in previous years.
“The team really has a really positive energy that goes above and beyond other teams I’ve coached in the fall,” Smith said.
Being the national champs may make the Trojans a target for other players even though it is not a team tournament.
“Everyone wants to beat us even though it’s not a team event,” Johnson said.

The USC women’s cross country team is searching for a spark, which it will try to find it this weekend at the Vanguard Invitational in Costa Mesa.
Two weeks after the Women of Troy did not live up to expectations at the competitive Stanford Invitational, USC is hoping that the recently scheduled Vanguard meet will give the team momentum with the Pac-10 championships only three weeks away.

“I’m waiting for this team to break out,” said coach Tom Walsh. “We’ve been training very well and it just hasn’t shown in races. But we’ve been doing some really good things the past few weeks and hopefully they will show on Saturday.”
Originally, Walsh did not plan on having his team race in between Stanford and the Cal State Northridge Meet on Oct. 16. However, after a slew of injuries and illnesses to begin the season, Walsh felt the team needed an extra tune-up before the homestretch.
“I added this meet because we have had people that are behind schedule as far as the season is concerned,” Walsh said. “I also did it because we have so many young people on the team. They need more experience at the college level.”
One of the runners affected by injury at the beginning of the season was junior Zsofia Erdelyi, who two weeks ago rebounded to finish 13th overall at Stanford. Erdelyi’s coach expects even more from her this Saturday.
“I’d like to see Zsofia win the race,” Walsh said. “She was behind schedule because of her foot injury and a late track season. But I’m happy with her progress. An extra race will be very good for her.”
Captain Bridget Helgerson did not have quite the race Erdelyi had at Stanford, but improved after a rocky start to her season. Walsh said he expects Helgerson to keep getting better as the season progresses.
“Bridget is looking really good,” Walsh said. “Before Stanford she really started to turn it around. Her training has really picked up, and I’m looking forward to a good race from her.”
As with the week before Stanford, the Women of Troy all saw their training pick up with the bye week. Without a Saturday race to curb hard workouts, Walsh increased the intensity.
“We trained even harder than we did before Stanford,” Walsh said. “They’ve responded well to the intensity. The Stanford meet was a wake-up call for us. We didn’t perform the way we could have or should have, but the will to be successful is definitely there.”
While arguably the team’s most competitive meet is out of the way, Walsh insists that the most important ones are yet to come.
“[Vanguard] is not quite Pac-10 level,” Walsh admitted. “But we need to somehow get a win at this meet. We need something to get going for the rest of the season. I’m hoping we win this meet. Just being competitive won’t satisfy me, or the girls.”
The 5K race will begin on Saturday at 9 a.m. at Fairview Park.

Turnover Wednesday finally lived up to its name.
After two weeks of USC’s offense taking care of the ball, the Trojans’ defense teed off by notching four turnovers at Wednesday’s practice.
Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley threw three interceptions and redshirt junior wide receiver Travon Patterson lost a fumble to highlight an opportunistic day for the defense. Freshman cornerback Torin Harris came down with one of the picks and senior Kevin Thomas had a diving sideline catch that resulted in the cornerback being mobbed by his fellow defensive backs.
On cue · Kevin Thomas had one of three interceptions Wednesday. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
“It was a good day for the defense,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “I’m glad they were able to turn the ball around.”
The performance mirrored the Trojan defense’s recent increase in creating turnovers. In the last two games, USC has had five takeaways.
The unit has also registered 21 sacks and is allowing 8.6 points per game, both best in the Pac-10.
Carroll said he did not think Wednesday’s results indicated offensive concerns.
“Some of the quarterbacks misread coverages on new routes, but there were a couple of really good plays on defense as well,” Carroll said.
u
With the midway point of the season rapidly approaching, quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates said he was growing more comfortable with allowing Barkley to work with more of the offensive playbook.
USC’s coaching staff tried to simplify the attack for the signal-caller but is entrusting him a wider assortment of complex plays.
“He’s mastered the book, but we weren’t going to throw the whole book at him in week one,” Bates said. “He’s definitely earned that opportunity now.”
Having a more complete arsenal to work with comes as a welcome change for USC’s quarterback.
“It just gives you more flexibility,” Bates said. “It spreads things out and puts more pressure on the defense.”
Bates said he was pleased with the offense’s development but still hoped to see improvements on third down and in the red zone. The Trojans converted six of 15 third-down opportunities against Cal but had to settle for three field goals when the offense stalled inside the Golden Bears’ 10-yard line.
“We’re adding some new plays and changing some concepts,” Bates said. “At the end of the day, we just have to find a way to get it in [the end zone].”
u
Wide receiver Ronald Johnson practiced again Wednesday, but Carroll said he did not think the junior would be at full strength for his expected return next Saturday against Notre Dame.
“We have to manage this really well and not overdo it,” Carroll said. “We’re going to limit him until he has a chance to be full speed.”

Amid an ongoing NCAA investigation, player departures to the NBA and academic eligibility issues, the USC men’s basketball program appears to be in transition.
For first-year coach Kevin O’Neill, the task of turning a program marred by recent controversy into an upper-echelon competitor in the Pac-10 may be an extremely tough challenge. But for a team looking for an identity and a leader to guide it toward a successful campaign, the one person the Trojans may rely on most is the one member of their team who has yet to suit up for a game: redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson.
Back at home · After spending his first season with North Carolina, Alex Stepheson joined the Trojans last season. The former Harvard-Westlake star is ready for his chance to play in front of his hometown crowd. -  Courtesy of UNC Athletic Communications 
Stepheson, a former standout at nearby Harvard-Westlake High School, transferred from the University of North Carolina before the beginning of last season and was hoping to be a key contributor for USC last year. Just days into the season, however, the NCAA rejected his appeal to be granted immediate eligibility, and, for the first time in his basketball career, Stepheson was forced to watch from the sidelines.
“Everyone was having fun together and winning as a team, and to not be part of that was a difficult experience,” Stepheson said.
As USC staged its miraculous run to the NCAA Tournament last March, the 6-foot-9, 235-pound forward who had been a part of the Tar Heels Final Four team the previous year was left to play the role of cheerleader.
For a player who had been lauded out of high school for his work ethic and love of the game, Stepheson did not waste his yearlong break from competition and instead spent the time improving.
Stepheson, known primarily as a “defensive-minded” player, spent the majority of the last season working on another dimension of his game: his offense.
“The year off gave me time to work on my post-up moves, 15-foot jump shots and free-throw shooting,” he said.
And while the local high school product admits the defensive-minded label at times can be bothersome, he is excited for this year and the chance to prove to scouts and fans alike that he is a complete player.
On paper, the program may have a tough road ahead, but Stepheson is confident that the Trojans will surprise a lot of people around the country this season.
“This year is an exciting chance for us as a team,” Stepheson said. “It is an opportunity to prove to a lot of people we have what it takes to be successful.”
Going into this year, the Trojans will not resemble the ’08-’09 team which captured the Pac-10 Tournament Championship for the first time in the program’s history. Star center Taj Gibson and freshman phenom DeMar DeRozan left school early with dreams of the NBA. Both were taken within the first 26 picks of the 2009 NBA Draft. Starting point guard Daniel Hackett went back to his home country of Italy to play for Benetton Treviso of the Euroleague. And, in the bombshell of the summer, Tim Floyd — the only coach to lead the Trojans to three straight tournament appearances — signed his letter of resignation, leaving the program in shambles and an inexperienced team to pick up the pieces.
The team will be hard-pressed to repeat the level of achievement that has been regular the past few seasons, but Stepheson believes that O’Neill is more than an admirable replacement for the departed Floyd.
For the pessimists around campus and the college basketball community at large, Stepheson has an exciting message.
“You will see us run more, get out in more fast breaks and hopefully score more points,” he said.
While he has been praised as a tenacious defender who has the ability to change games with his shot-blocking abilities and strength on the boards, Stepheson’s greatest asset to the team might be his ability to lead. After the departure of Gibson, a former Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year and team co-captain, Stepheson realizes that this year the team will depend on his vocal presence as much as his on-court contribution.
“I will do what it takes for us to win this year,” he said. “The team will definitely miss Taj’s passion for the game and constant hustle, but I hope to come in and instill a winning mentality and sense of toughness that is necessary to win at this level night in and night out.”
The new post presence for the Trojans is well aware of the line of successful big men to play at USC, from Sam Clancy to Brian Scalabrine to Gibson. But for an athlete who was told he couldn’t even compete last year, Stepheson isn’t too concerned about what his legacy will be when his days at USC conclude.
“It would be nice to be considered with the good post players who have come through this program, but this year is about working hard and making the most of the opportunity,” he said.
So as the team gears up for its home opener against UC Riverside Nov. 17, the big man who left a powerhouse program in search of a chance to play in front of his hometown fans will relish his homecoming, even if it is more than a year in the making.
On the surface the program may look like it’s on the rebound, left to carry the burden of past mistakes and key departures, but look closer and you will find a budding star and a leader ready to carry the torch.
Alex Stepheson may not be a name you identify with yet. But if USC is able to make it to an historic fourth straight NCAA Tournament and rise above the negativity and cynicism that surrounds the team heading into this season, he will surely be a key reason.

Today is a tough day for columnists.
It’s the Thursday before an open Saturday and after a statement Saturday.
In laymen’s terms: USC doesn’t play this Saturday. And last Saturday, the Trojans silenced all the critics.
Well-earned rest · After celebrating their easy victory over Cal,  the Trojans answered a lot of questions, columnist Grant Tunkel writes. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Can the defense handle the Heisman front-runner Jahvid Best? Yes. He’s now on the Heisman backburner.
Can the offense handle the Cal 3-4 defense? Yes. The first two plays went for one yard. The next 75 went for 456.
Will the special teams finally come to play? Yes. A dazzling 66-yard punt return score by redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams, a perfect day in the field goal department and a 40-yard average day for the punter.
Can junior running back Joe McKnight handle an increased workload? Yes. Was Ohio State lightning in a bottle for freshman quarterback Matt Barkley? No. Were Cal quarterback Kevin Riley’s first three games an anomaly? USC’s defense made it look that way.
For the time being, there’s no questionable play-calling to talk about, no poor throws to scrutinize and no awful penalties that nearly cost the game to analyze.
So what is a columnist to do on a Thursday in the middle of a relatively slow week?
I could give you an early look at Notre Dame, but I won’t.  I’ll just tell you the Irish are down one of their best players in sophomore wide receiver Michael Floyd and that junior quarterback Jimmy Clausen seems to have some sort of nagging foot injury. Let that marinate over the weekend.
I could give you a “Viewer’s Guide to the Weekend Without a USC Football Game,” but I won’t. I’ll just note that there are some very intriguing football games this week.
No. 24 Missouri hosts No. 21 Nebraska tonight.
One-loss Boston College travels to No. 5 Virginia Tech in the topsy-turvy ACC in the morning hours (at least on this coast).
No. 3 Alabama plays on the road at No. 20 Mississippi. At the same time, undefeated Wisconsin plays on the road in the Horseshoe against No. 9 Ohio State. And No. 13 Oregon squares off at one-loss UCLA.
A little later, No. 1 Florida travels to No. 4 LSU sans Tim Tebow at the helm (for the time being). Michigan (4-1) plays at No. 12 Iowa (5-0). No. 22 Georgia Tech heads to Tallahassee to take on Florida State, Bobby Bowden rumors and all.
I could tell you that a LSU win will eliminate Florida from national championship contention, but I won’t. I’ll just note that it’s going to take two Florida losses to completely eliminate them from the picture — especially if the first one comes without that one guy who plays quarterback.
I could write this column about the art of picking college football games, but I won’t. I’ll just say that you should probably do the opposite of my picks in this week’s “Best Bets” section.
I could mention that the coaches will be using this free weekend to take recruiting trips, but I won’t.
I could tell you that those trips probably won’t prevent USC coach Pete Carroll from tweeting. But then again, I can’t say with any certainty that there isn’t some rule in the NCAA book that prevents that. So I won’t.
I could talk about the beginning of the MLB playoffs this week, but you probably already knew that, so I won’t.
I could mention that the NHL season is getting underway, but I have this sinking feeling that that probably doesn’t mean a lot to you, so I won’t.
I could talk about the USC women’s volleyball team’s Friday night showdown at Pauley Pavilion against UCLA, but I won’t. We have a volleyball writer who can do that.
I could talk about the men’s water polo team’s busy weekend, which includes two games each on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. But I won’t. We have a beat writer for that too.
I could preview the women’s soccer team’s two games at home this weekend, which open Pac-10 play, but I won’t. Yes, you guessed it — we have a beat writer for that as well.
I could write about the difference between watching a football game from the student section and from the press box, but that’s already been done, so I won’t.
I could give you an inside look at the press boxes of the various football stadiums I’ve been to this year, but I won’t. (Although it’s worth mentioning that the Horseshoe does have a McFlurry machine.)
I could throw in a few not-so-clever jokes and clichés, but I won’t. I want you to actually read this in the future.
I could fill this column with some rambling, not-very-cohesive thoughts about anything and everything. But I won’t.
Wait a minute. I think I just did that.
Oops.
I guess you could call it a case of a quiet Thursday.
“Thrilla on Manilla Paper” runs every other Thursday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Grant at tunkel@usc.edu.

To close or not to close? That is the question — or is it?
Recently, Greek senators in the Undergraduate Student Government decided to re-examine a past proposal that would effectively close off 28th Street to automobile traffic, with the exception of Department of Public Safety vehicles and emergency transportation.
The pitch for a blockade of the Row would either see a partial closure at the Figueroa Street side of 28th Street or a full closure with fraternity and sorority houses sandwiched in by kiosks or some alternative means of enclosure (for example, small scale replicas of the Great Wall).

On the surface, it seems like this is a no-brainer:
People drink on the Row. Drunk people meander into streets. Cars drive on streets.
And despite what any inebre-hero will tell you, the battle between man and machine is never fair.
So eliminating cars driving through streets haphazardly occupied by the undergraduate student body decreases the probability of accidents dramatically.
Simple enough, no?
It would be foolish to argue that the proposed measure does anything but improve the safety of those traveling up and down the Row on any given night. While there have luckily not been any incidents on the densely populated strip this year, there have been instances of accidents in the past. A move to close the Row helps increase peace of mind by promoting safety with the prevention of automotive traffic and outside entry.
The question then, is not a matter of whether or not the closure should happen, but how exactly the closure should happen, assuming it passes the many bureaucratic hurdles.
The first issue arises in the difference between full closure and partial closure.
Realistically, for emergency vehicles to be able to easily access all houses on 28th Street in an efficient manner, there could not be a full closure using permanent blockades. But by only employing a partial closure, it would be rather difficult to try and enforce the no-through-traffic rule to other cars.
Not to mention there has been no discussion as to what would happen with regards to University Avenue, which runs perpendicular to the Row and splits it in half. One can only assume that if both ends were closed off, University Avenue would also have to be cut off, for fear of undermining the efforts of the proposed closure.
But think of the headaches that would result from having added a new series of dead-end roads around the perimeter.
Let’s say that there is a way to close off through traffic on 28th Street completely and that there exists some means of entry for emergency and DPS vehicles.
Win-win situation, right?
Not quite.
Contrary to popular belief, there are people that actually live in the same fraternity house that your friend graciously puked at last weekend. The concept is abstract to some — like hearing that all the ride operators at Disneyland go to sleep at their respective attractions once the park is shut down for the night.
Although the spirit of the proposal seems to focus on minimizing the risk of injury to students partaking in the nightlife offered by the Greek community, it poses many further potential complications for those who reside on the Row during its tamer, off hours.
Finding a prime parking spot on the Row is like finding an extra chicken nugget in your four-piece order. But while parking is scarce, especially on street cleaning days and during some philanthropy events, it still exists. Closing off 28th Street to through traffic would eliminate dozens of parking spaces.
Many fraternity and sorority houses have parking lots in the backs of their properties that are accessible by back alleyways on either side of the Row. But even the biggest lots can only accommodate a fraction of the membership.
And by closing off the Row, what happens to the street cleaning that takes place regularly?
Mind you, this is not a case of a spoiled member of the Greek system who doesn’t want any part of cleaning up his own mess.
Each house should be responsible for the maintenance of its property. But if an army of red cups and scattered Del Taco wrappers start to accumulate thanks to efforts from non-Greek partygoers, they will continue to reside in the middle of the street up until it gets unbearable. It’s not unreasonable to think the Row could get much messier.
Making the Row an enclave in the off-campus area (Row Island, if you will) seems to be a very attractive and sound safety plan. But in taking a look at logistical concerns, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that what seems like a common sense solution has not already been implemented.
Ultimately, 28th Street should be closed off to outside traffic in the interest of safety and reduced liability, but not before there’s a way to figure out how to accommodate those that live on the Row.

Five minutes into Stark Raving Black, I started looking at my watch. Then I realized I do not own a watch and proceeded to start daydreaming about what my watch would look like if I did wear one, and whether or not it would suit me. Then Lewis Black yelled, and my attention snapped back to the screen. This situation repeated itself for the next 75 minutes of Black’s first concert film.
On The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Black is funny. His quick segment called “Back in Black” is the longest-running segment on the show because it points out humorous stories that may not have been covered by mainstream media. “Back in Black” works because it is short and concise; however, when multiple “Back in Black” segments are strung together back-to-back, as in Stark Raving Black, the humor wears thin and the time marches on ever so slowly.
One man show · Comedian Lewis Black, who is most recognizable for his “Back in Black” segments on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, releases his first concert film in theaters for a limited one-week engagement.
There are definitely people in life that leave you thirsting for more — unfortunately, Black is not one of them. A few minutes of Black are certainly enough to satisfy. Beyond that, he is simply not that funny in the film. That may be one reason why it will only be in theaters Oct. 8 to Oct. 15 (after one week on the big screen, the film will be released as a DVD).
Stark Raving Black demonstrates Black’s ability to provoke his audience through a take-no-prisoners commentary on current events. The film’s footage was shot during two August 2009 shows at the Fillmore Theater in Detroit. The result is classic Black stand-up, which, for the uninitiated, consists of a lengthy, sarcastic rant — a la Sam Kinison — about some topic or irritant of interest to Black. The rant is followed by an ear-piercing obscenity and concludes with Black’s trademark shaking of his finger.
Although the yelling is sometimes appropriate, its reoccurrence at the end of every joke is redundant and tiring. Black also attempts to compensate for his lack of fresh material by shouting expletives at his audience, who seems to be laughing only out of fear. Black has been hailed for giving an outlet to his audience through his yelling so they do not have to. But listening to someone shout and shouting on your own are two very different activities, and truthfully, the former is rather frustrating.
Overall, Black’s comedy is observational, commenting on everything from the obviously vulnerable Bush administration to his personal support of alternative energy. Bits and pieces are funny, but there is a feeling that his prime days as a comedian have passed. By the time I had finished watching Stark Raving Black and decided that I would not be able to pull a watch off after all, only one joke remained memorable. The rest seemed to blend one into another in a mind-numbing stream of consciousness ramble reminiscent of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s recent 90-minute, nonsensical monologue at the United Nations. When Black finally stopped talking, I felt as if I had just ended a phone call with my 84-year-old grandmother who tends to chatter incoherently at a volume loud enough for all her hard-of-hearing neighbors at the senior living community to hear.
Black succeeds on The Daily Show because his segment is given a time limit and he has a subject on which to focus. His humor is appropriate there, as he can point out the stupidity of blatantly foolish subjects. But when given a microphone and a captive audience, he clings to his angry, aging white guy shtick that has become his routine.
Those who prefer Mitch Hedberg’s subtle hilarity or the quick wit of Jon Stewart will find Black tedious and grouchy. Instead of actually going to a movie theater and buying an overpriced ticket, you may want to wait to happen upon Stark Raving Black on Comedy Central on a lazy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. If you are one of those rarer breeds who prefer angry humor and rants about the environment, Black’s newest film is right up your alley. If you’re still unsure, watch the preview for the film on YouTube — it pretty much sums up the entire 80 minutes.

Latina voters are accessing the Internet and “new media” in increasing numbers, and political campaigns will have to spend more — and speak to a broader set of issues — to reach those voters, expert panelists said Wednesday, in response to a new poll commissioned in partnership by a USC political center.
The poll also found just 41 percent of Spanish-dominant Latina voters have access to the internet, compared to 71 percent of English-dominant ones, and that education and the presence of children at home significantly increased the access to internet in Latina households.
Room for debate · Panelists at Wednesday’s Talk Back lunch discussed the findings of a new poll that examined Latinas’ use of new media. - Nick Muellerleile | Daily Trojan
The poll, conducted by Hispanas Organized for Political Equality in conjunction with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, studied California Latinas’ use of new media — defined by access to the Internet and owning an email account — education, language-spoken, participation in community and civic organizations, and even text messaging.
The announcement of the poll’s results was followed by a panel discussion where an array of experts discussed the changes to California’s political landscape and the methods by which future campaigns would have to expand their outlook to court Latino voters.
“It’s important for democracy for every participant in the United States to feel like they have a voice,” said Sergio Bendixen, a panelist and the president of Bendixen & Associates, the multicultural and multiethnic research company that assisted in the poll.
Bendixen explained the key findings in the study: There was a clear relationship between Latinas with children at home and having access to the Internet. The poll also found that  as well as being involved politically and civically. Most notably, however, the poll found a great language divide: English-speaking Latinas are more likely to access new media than Spanish-speaking Latinas.
The six members of the Talk Back panel, including students and experts, discussed the poll’s findings.
Bendixen said he thought it was important to reach out to both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking Latinas. He suggested developing websites where people can showcase information important to Latinas.
Bendixen also said he thought it was important for campaigns to reach out to immigrants in addition to Latina voters.
“It’s not only important for the Hispanic community but also for the country,” he said.
Margita Thompson, former press secretary for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said the growing popularity of new media would give Latinas the opportunity to blog and write about issues important to them.
Helen Torres, executive director of HOPE, explained how the group intends to use the poll results.
“We hope to be conducting briefings with foundations, political campaigns, and legislatures, so they can utilize this information,” she said. “This informs their outreach efforts so it will make them more inclusive, including Latinas.”
Panelists discussed the successes and failures of efforts of past presidential campaigns, like those of George W. Bush, Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, in their outreach to Latina communities.
The discussion was an eye-opener for some students, including Alex Jacobs, a junior majoring in public relations. She noted that she is from Utah, a much less diverse place than Los Angeles.
“I probably wouldn’t have done much research on the Latina vote … but it’s good to know if you’re going to represent how they vote, she said.”
Torres said HOPE plans to keep working with USC because it would help inform the student body and faculty about the organization’s work and will continue to assist advocacy efforts in the area.
or maybe…
Just more clarification as to what exactly constitutes Latina.
I think the article means Latino.
Latina = a lady women of color.
If you want to help the latina population, concentrate on teaching them english and helping them to assimilate into American society. Diversity isn’t what makes this nation great, it’s the unity we get by coming together as Americans.” E pluribus unum, from many one.” The US is the melting pot of the world. When one segment doesn’t assimilate, it becomes divisive and in conflict with the rest of the country. It happens in other nations as well. Check out Quebec and the rest of Canada. Several efforts have been made to separate. Could this happen in the US?

It is no secret that there are far too few women in film. The industry has a long history of male dominance; in fact, up until the early 1940s, the only major role for women in film (besides acting) was the position of script supervisor — or the  “script girl,” as it came to be called, because women were only good at taking notes and noticing details. It was assumed women could not have a worthwhile opinion about anything of importance, let alone tell a story with some lights and a camera.
As men built the giant media structure that is the film industry, it became increasingly difficult for women to fight their way into positions of authority. They have yet to gain the same level of creative impact as their male counterparts today.
Women make up only 6 percent of the directors and 10 percent of the writers of the top-grossing films in America each year. They still feel the need to band together and fight this gap, forming groups such as the Women of Cinematic Arts organization at USC. Such information is disheartening in an era where men and women are supposed to be able to achieve equal success in the work field.
But the women making their names in Hollywood right now are not exactly bringing esteem to the creative powers of the female sex. Currently, there are two highly publicized female-driven films in multiplexes across the country: Jennifer’s Body and Whip It.
Actually, by the time this article runs, Jennifer’s Body may be condemned only to the tiny theaters at the end of the multiplex hallway, because the film was a complete box office disaster on opening weekend, grossing only about $6 million.
What makes this flop all the more shameful is the female power behind it. The script was written by Oscar winner Diablo Cody (of Juno fame) and the film was directed by up-and-comer Karyn Kusama (Girlfight).
The two women came to the CTCS 466 Theatrical Film Symposium class here at USC a few weeks ago. They constantly emphasized their mission to create a film that would cater entirely to women. They clearly missed their mark, beginning with the unfortunate casting of Megan Fox. The movie’s poor writing surely didn’t help ticket sales, either.
Whip It did not perform any better — it grossed a measly $4.6 million its opening weekend, losing to the somewhat male-skewed comedy success Zombieland, which pulled in $24.7 million.
Whip It was directed by Drew Barrymore and features an all-female cast, including Ellen Page (Juno). Its theme is best described as “girl power.” Well, where’s the power? The film, unlike Jennifer’s Body, was well-received critically and is a clever and entertaining entry in the void of female-targeted movies. Most of the people who went to see it liked it, but the film did not draw in a large enough audience to prove its worth.
Movies made by women for women consistently fail to make a financial dent, unless the film in question is Sex and the City. And that film did not exactly win any accolades for its artistic achievements (unless you count a nomination for the Teen Choice Awards).
The fact of the matter is that the majority of the filmmaking world is structured around appealing to young men. The executives believe that, while women will go see a movie targeted towards males, men will absolutely not go to movies made for women (how many male readers went to see Julie & Julia?). And this is true, but only because the movies made especially for women are usually horrible, dumbed-down romantic comedies that make the female sex seem like a bunch of love-obsessed idiots.
Even when women actually do direct films of impressive artistic merit, they rarely receive much audience attention. Who saw The Hurt Locker (directed by Kathryn Bigelow) this year, besides a handful of film students?
This was one of the few films of late that proved that women are able to direct films about any subject matter (such as the war in Iraq) just as skillfully as men, yet it made only a ripple of an appearance in our cultural bubble.
It won rave critical reviews, but only brought in a handful of viewers. Its one success was the fact that men were not afraid to enter the theater to see this female-led film because of its universal subject matter.
As with male-driven films, the sex of the director should not indicate the quality or the content of the work.
As a female hoping to break into the film business within the next year or so, artistic or financial failures like Jennifer’s Body and Whip It are unbelievably frustrating. It is already difficult enough for men to claw their way into this unforgiving industry. With hardly any proof that women are talented, too, the percentage of female successes is even slimmer.
Women in the film industry need to start stepping up their game. It may be a struggle to gain equality in such a limited field, but the battle is only going to be more difficult if all women can show for their work is a series of financial losses and artistic flops.

Few students have noticed the world-class institution sitting right across the street.
Even fewer realize it’s free.
Located across the street from USC  in Exposition Park, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County boasts more than 35 million specimens, some of which are as much as 4.5 million years old. The museum includes an array of exhibits displaying dinosaurs, African mammals, insects, birds and various elements of California’s history.
We’re back · Sculptures of dinosaurs appear to do battle outside the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in Exposition Park, across the street from USC. The museum is attempting to expand its relationship with USC students and faculty. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
But, despite an exclusive discount offering free admission to USC students, awareness of the museum on campus is still relatively low.
“Word is slowly getting out. We are beginning to get more calls from professors and we are still making calls,” said Su Oh, director of education at the museum. “You don’t have to jump into a car to go, students just have to walk across the street.”
But many students said they didn’t know about the museum.
Beyond just the exhibits, the museum offers programs including “First Fridays,” a nighttime event that transforms the museum to accommodate a band, a DJ, food and drinks. Michael Quick, executive vice dean for the College of Arts and Sciences, moderates the “First Fridays.”
“They approached me and I thought it was a great opportunity. We are right across the street, we do a lot of science so it seems natural to be a part of this,” Quick said.
Though entrance to “First Fridays” is also free to students, Oh said few have taken advantage of the opportunity.
“Ironically more people who have to pay attend the event even though USC students get in for free,” Oh said. “It gets tough, students get caught up with their work but the museum can be fun.”
The museum facilitates program lectures, allows researchers to work with professors — some scientists are also be adjunct faculty — and partners with The College Commons to sponsor lectures.
Oh said the museum is trying to enhance its awareness on campus, especially about opportunities it offers to the faculty.
“I think there can be a long-term collaboration that can support students and create outside-the-box events. Currently we have individual people with individual ideas,” she said. “If we have their faculty and our faculty involved it can lead to courses, field trips, internships — creating more opportunities for students.”
The museum also offers opportunities directly for students, like internships, volunteer work, research opportunities and work-study positions.
Some students feel having the opportunity to use their work-study at the museum creates a different experience.
“It’s nice to get off campus for a while, it feels more like a real job,” said Joel Kropinski, a junior majoring in cinema-television critical studies, who works at the museum’s marketing and communication office. “The museum is an important part of the community and I’m glad to be a part of it.”
The museum also has a few USC graduate students who, as part to their dissertation research, work closely with the curators at the museum. As “graduate students in residence at the museum,” they are provided with office space and other resources including access to the collections they need for their research.
Jack Tseng, one of the graduate students in residence, said working at the museum has been an integral part of his graduate work at USC.
“Many of the paleontologists at the museum are very famous, not to mention they do excellent work, and that was part of the attraction for me to conduct my graduate study at USC,” Tseng, a doctoral candidate in the integrative and evolutionary biology program, wrote in an email.
Tseng further emphasized how valuable the museum resources are.
“Evolutionary biologists come from all over the world to visit the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County for its research specimens, and we have everything right in our backyard,” Tseng said.
The proximity of the museum to USC also allows some curators to continue their education.
James Dines, a collections manager at the museum, is currently attending USC and working on his Ph.D. in integrative evolutionary biology.
“It’s a unique arrangement since we’re right across the street from each other,” Dines said. “There is actually a long standing of curators who are also adjunct faculty and some staff workers at the museum are also obtaining their degrees at USC.”
Dines said he hopes students realize the museum can be used as a resource to emphasize what they learn in class.
“It’s not just a museum you go to when you’re a kid, there [are] a lot of interesting things that go on outside of what students learn in class,” Dines said.
Many students said they were interested, but don’t always have enough time.
“It’s not high on my priority list,” Cynthia Lee, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science. “But it is something I want to do before I graduate.”
Quick acknowledged that students might not have time, but pointed out if they don’t take advantage of the opportunity now, they might not get to it later.
“People are busy, and since it’s in your backyard you feel like you will do it eventually but you never do,” Quick said. “If they feel it’s boring, after attending some events they may change their mind.”

Y chromosome competent
As a former Boy Scout and new engineer, I found the Sept. 30 article “Do-it-yourself projects leave many dangling,” although humorous and arguably meaningful, to be mildly discourteous to do-it-yourselfers in general and even more aggressively abusive to those of us with Y chromosomes — graphic images and penis jokes aside.
To say that we attempt to complete projects ourselves simply out of stinginess or out of sheer bravado or “pig-headed”-ness — as Laura puts it — is to discount the entire motive behind problem-solving and hobbies as a whole. It is not in the fact of having something but rather in the act of producing it that we gain satisfaction. We achieve a greater understanding of the selected topic as well a sense of success/pride/accomplishment/importance. Now, it may all sound like posturing, but from a male perspective, it’s with articles such as this one that incessantly promote the ideological stigma associated with the macho “male ego,” and with the steady advance of technology, that men begin to feel a sense of debasement and perhaps even in some dark cases: inadequacy.
Do-it-yourself projects provide a simple and safe solution (usually). I mean, if you ask me, we could all use a little confidence boost here and there, even if it comes at the cost of expedience.
Although I disagree with some of the messages of your article, I enjoyed reading it, so keep writing about fun topics. This comes as a response and not a critique. You can insult IKEA for lack of manual oversight and the penis enlargement industry as a whole, but leave me the beds and the hobbies.

Last weekend, the women’s tennis team sent four players to the Cal Nike Intercollegiate Tennis Association Invitational, where they earned 12 total victories during singles play.
Junior Cristala Andrews topped the singles competition in flight B. Andrews won five straight matches, including a three-set victory in the championship match against Cal’s Taylor Davis (6-4, 3-6, 6-1). Junior Lyndsay Kinstler also played in Andrew’s flight. Kinstler won her first two matches in straight sets but was defeated in the quarterfinals by Cal’s Kasia Siwosz, the No. 8 seed.
Freshman Valeria Pulido and junior Leyla Entekhabi also participated in the action during singles play in flight A. Entekhabi cruised through the first round of 32, before falling in the second round to Cal’s No. 1 seed. Pulido coasted through the first three rounds before being ousted in the semifinals.
During doubles play, Entekhabi and Kinstler fell early to competition against Saint Mary. Andrews and Pulido also paired up and advanced to the second round but were defeated by top seeds in the quarterfinals.
Back in Los Angeles, another USC freshman, Danielle Lao, began her Trojan career in the prequalifying rounds at UCLA in preparation for the upcoming Riviera/ITA All-American. Lao swept through the competition by winning three straight matches.
This was enough to advance her into this weekend’s qualifying rounds where she will join her two other teammates, senior Sarah Fansler and sophomore Alison Ramos, in the single’s qualifying rounds on Oct. 6 and Oct. 7 at the Riviera Country Club. Fansler will also be paired up with Kinstler, as will Pulido and junior Maria Sanchez for the qualifying rounds of doubles this weekend. Sanchez will begin play on Oct. 8 for the main event.

Imagine a world where camouflage promotes peace and love instead of war. That is the vision of Seamus McGovern, creator of Love Fatigues, a clothing line that features standard camouflage design — with a twist.
“We’re trying to steal [camouflage] from the military, steal it from the urban markets and create what I’m calling love camouflage,” McGovern said.
A New Yorker and University of Massachusetts graduate, McGovern formed the idea behind Love Fatigues in 2004. While living on a small island off the coast of Madagascar, McGovern first envisioned the pattern of an image of a man and woman embracing, set against a camouflage backdrop.
Five years later, McGovern’s flash of creativity became a reality when Love Fatigues launched its image-infused camouflage clothing line. Since the line’s release, Love Fatigues has begun to establish its presence and love-focused movement throughout the world. McGovern still recalls the first time he saw a Love Fatigue camouflage shirt on the streets.
“I actually saw somebody on a beach wearing a Love Fatigues out of nowhere … and my two kids actually spotted it,” McGovern said. “It was really exciting … my kids were really excited about it, too.”
With a strong following in both the United States and France, the company is expanding its product line and operations. Originally based in New York, Love Fatigues is currently in the process of moving its manufacturing operations to Los Angeles.
But now that Love Fatigues has clothing under its belt, the company is expanding its brand to include a new social network.
The social networking site WorldLovePages.com is, like other products of Love Fatigues, a part of McGovern’s vision for a world of love and peace. Ultimately, World Love Pages is a translation site that McGovern hopes will break down the cultural and language barriers between people from different countries. McGovern operates World Love Pages from France, where he currently lives. The site allows a user from Los Angeles to see a Russian user’s profile and translates comments into English, for example.
“The idea was, what if we could take a Facebook and turn it into a translation site where everybody in the world can actually talk in sort of the same language?” McGovern said.
The newest component to the Love Fatigues brand, World Love Pages is revolutionizing the Love Fatigues brand and its movement. By allowing users to speak a universal language, World Love Pages pushes Love Fatigues one step closer to creating a unified peace movement.
“It’s a place where you can bring music, art, poetry, photography,” McGovern said. “It’s basically a place to share all sorts of different ideas in the language that you speak …  [and] translate it to other languages so other people can actually understand what your thoughts are.”
As World Love Pages continues to grow, McGovern has left the future of the social network in the hands of its users.
“It’s just phenomenal what we’re beginning to do right now,” McGovern said. “With World Love Pages we’re building a foundation for free thinkers and artists. We don’t want to fish the creation of it. We want our users to build it for us.”
Regardless of the future of the World Love Pages, the goal of Love Fatigues remains the same ­­— to create a love movement driven by image-infused camouflage.
“What I would really like to do is make a social change,” McGovern said. “Everyone’s wearing camouflage, but what if they realized they had a choice … to buy camouflage that’s part military or camouflage that’s part peace.”
Beyond empowering individuals to make a choice, McGovern hopes to give meaning to camouflage and change what it represents.
“We’re really hoping to have people help us to turn this whole camouflage on its head,” McGovern said. “Turn it upside down to peace.”
Over the next couple of years, McGovern hopes his camouflage will revolutionize the face of militaries across the globe. Camouflage would become the universal uniform of a military for peace. A universal camouflage that would unite all countries into a collective military whose goal is peace.
“Camouflage would stand out differently, so anybody seeing it would know, ‘Wow, these guys are here to help; it’s not for war,’” McGovern said.
No matter where Love Fatigues’ success takes camouflage, the company has one underlining goal.
“What we want to do in success is be prolific and help the world,” McGovern said.

In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
We all know the grade-school rhyme that helps children everywhere remember just which Italian explorer planted a little European flag in the North American continent, bringing with him horses, coffee and smallpox.
Americans even observe a holiday in his honor by closing down post offices on the second Monday of October in an attempt to perpetuate a myth about the country’s origins of discovery.
But there is an indifference to this holiday felt even more so here on the West Coast, where children grow up making Spanish missions out of Cheerios and bowtie pasta, complete with tiny plastic Native Americans.
Perhaps it is because West Coast dwellers do not feel the same kind of connection to the founding of a country that does not look like their surroundings. In California, the New World is still new; the skeletons of our founding fathers aren’t present as constant reminders of our origins. Californian history has a poor physical manifestation of a past shrouded in agricultural growth, forced religious conversion and entertainment.
Unlike older East Coast cities that have historical buildings, complete with bullet holes and patina rust, California’s landmarks are either remarkably young, part of a film or ravaged by seasons of fire, mudslides or earthquakes.
Local history, however, does not apologize for its lack of recognition. California subscribes to the same exact brand of origin mythology as does America and its glorification of a foreign sailor — just to a lesser degree.
The first European to see the shores of California, Hernán Cortés, arrived in what was originally called “the Californias” in 1535, hoping to reap the benefits from what Europeans believed was a long island, and instead, discovered to be inhospitable and too hot for their taste.
Later, explorers swished by the state’s ports, but Father Junipero Serra truly left a lasting colonial mark with a nine-mission system that sought to transform the hundreds of heathen indigenous into obedient, “Hail Mary”-chanting Catholics.
In the third grade, the little kiddies get the politically correct version of the story, and hear about how Father Serra stood at a tiny 5-foot-2 and how the kind old man traveled up and down the coast on the Camino Real, marked by magical bells and cacti.
Each eager child then chooses his or her very own mission to write a report on and gives a presentation in front of the class showing off a structure made of graham crackers, plaster of paris or brown Legos that crudely resembles the San Gabriel Mission or San Carlos de Borromeo de Carmelo.
From the first mission in Alta California founded on July 16, 1769, San Diego de Alcalá, to the last, San Francisco Solano founded on July 4, 1823, the missions served as Spanish religious and physical posts placed a day’s worth of travel from one another. With a church, bell tower and plaza, each mission took its name from a different Catholic saint, stringing together a delicate chain of livestock, indigenous exchange, artistic growth, agriculture and political alliances.
Many of the major California cities started off as mission villages, including Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose. The missions were secularized in 1834, when a newly independent Mexico tried to sell off the lands, which often contained remnants of the wine and wheat the missions had produced.
It wasn’t until 1863 that the missions became an official part of the Catholic Church, which was well after many of the missions had been ravaged by natural disasters, Native American raids, minor battles and secularization.
Now, missions have cemented themselves as kitschy road trip destinations, local parishes and quaint, adobe-shaded wedding locations with gardens that used to grow olives through coerced labor. We don’t sugarcoat this unnatural past with a made-up holiday that gives lazy bureaucrats an excuse to sleep in on a Monday, but let our children find out the cruel past after they’re past the arts-and-crafts age.
California has an excuse for this dedication to a forged founding history, however. The very name of the state comes from a novel where California is a paradise island replete with strong women ruled by Queen Califia, who only let men on the island one day a year to replenish the island’s population.
Though Californians today do not have that Amazon lifestyle, we can certainly pretend to. Who knows — maybe they’d even make a holiday out of it.

A big announcement today: The school formerly known as The Annenberg School for Communication has gotten a name change — and an ampersand.
President Steven B. Sample and Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III announced today that the school will now be known as the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
That little “&” is a big move for the school, asserting a dedication to the equal statuses of — and connection between — the two disciplines.  Journalism is no longer a sub-school of Annenberg, but gets to be proudly emblazoned on the school’s name itself, as the massive new banner outside Annenberg shows.
The banner, and name, was unveiled today. The name change was kept secret, and a huge red curtain hung on the east side of the Annenberg above E.F. Hutton Park. Trustee Wallis Annenberg, who had long advocated the change, was present when the curtain fell and the new name was revealed, amid choruses of the fight song played by the Spirit of Troy and streamers exploding from cannons.

Remember that bike you had that got stolen? Remember that other bike you had that also got stolen? Well this Saturday at 9 a.m., DPS, is generously offering us the chance to buy them back!
Provided that you show up Friday night around 7 p.m.
Those impounded bikes go for the low, low price of $25. Like certain other purveyors of bicycles around the University campus, DPS only takes cash. But since the prices are so much lower, you won’t feel as though you are walking around with enough cash to buy several crates of illegal narcotics.
So get out your barbeque and your sleeping bag and try not to feel bad about the fact that, if you still have your new bike next week, you will probably be pulled over for jay biking.
DPS giveth, and DPS taketh away.
“Laura Reeve, making an impact”?? How about “Laura Reeve, not doing her homework!”
This was the most horribly written article.  Take some English classes and think about your audience when you write.  It makes you seem like you feel “big” about yourself when you write like that.  On a completely unrelated note, what sorority did you pledge?
The office of the registrar sent out an email to all USC students because of this article.
Laura Reeve, making an impact!
Maybe that’s why they are selling them so cheap, they probably figure the ticket they give you will make up the difference…”DPS giveth, DPS taketh away”-loved it!
I love that you linked “certain other purveyors” to the bike store, thats hilarious.
I am confused. Here, you said “Like certain other purveyors of bicycles around the University campus, DPS only takes cash.” But the site you linked to says they accept credit cards.
The jaybiking phenomenon has me thoroughly flustered. I want to get out my barbeque and my lawn chair and hold up a sign at offending intersections, warning unsuspecting bikers.
On a side note, I have to emphasize how excited I am that I will now get multiple days of Folk Laur per week. Can you say life-changer?

In its 15th year of fundraising for the community, USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign is beginning its annual October push to increase the amount of money raised and the percentage of faculty involved.
The Good Neighbors Campaign, initiated by President Steven B. Sample on the heels of the Los Angeles riots of 1992, is an annual fundraising program that facilitates USC faculty and staff donations to community programs.

Despite the current economic climate, Thomas Sayles, USC’s vice president for government and community relations said the campaign is encouraging faculty and staff to continue to donate.
“One of the things we’re saying to folks is that we know things are tough right now in the general economy,” Sayles said. “But if you think it’s tough for us, think about how tough it is for people in the surrounding communities.”
The campaign kicks into gear every October, setting goals and soliciting donations from faculty and staff. This year, the Good Neighbors Campaign is hoping to raise $1.2 million and record 50 percent participation from USC employees, according to Thomas Sayles, USC’s vice president for government and community relations.
Last year’s goal, which the campaign successfully met, was
$1.1 million and 42 percent participation.
From 1995 to 2008, the program has raised $10 million, and all of the money has gone to 365 grants to fund local programs. About half of the money this year will go to school-based programs, Sayles said.
Grants are distributed based on applications and community organizations must join with a university partner to apply.
Last year’s campaign funds went to 37 different community programs, some of which are benefiting from the outreach. Each program received a grant between $3,500 and $53,000.
One program that has received grants in the past — and more than $14,000 from last year’s campaign — is the Health Sciences Campus Community Health Fair. Scheduled for Oct. 17, the fair will provide free flu shots and health screenings.
“Literally thousands of people can get screened,” said Cesar Armendariz, the director of community outreach at HSC. “One family even drove all the way from the Inland Empire to get screened because they don’t have health insurance. Thanks to the fair they can get a shot and get screened and see if they’re OK.”
Matthew Calzetta of the Keck School of Medicine is currently working on Proyecto Verde, a plan to create a community garden at Clinica Romero, a community center in Koreatown. The project received its first grant last year, with more than $12,000 going toward a garden to beautify the area and serve as both an educational and therapeutic space.
“I started planning before I even knew about the Good Neighbors Campaign, but another doctor had planned to do the same thing,” Calzetta said. “Everything worked out well — we just set all of the criteria and got the grant.”
Another program, Fit Families, has been funded by Good Neighbors for three years and received a grant of more than $19,000 last year. Fit Families helps kids from ages 10-17 integrate healthy activity into their lifestyles.
“It has been inspirational,” said Cheryl Resnik, an assistant professor of clinical physical therapy and the director of Fit Families. “We’ve even had kids bring their parents in because they were concerned about their parents’ health.”
With their goal even higher than last year’s, the leaders of the Good Neighbors Campaign hope that it will be able to make an even bigger impact.
“As one of our deans once said, what’s good for USC is good for the community, and what’s good for the community is good for USC,” Sayles said. “It really is a real
partnership and it’s something we can all be very proud of.”

In hopes of bringing a high-profile speaker to campus this semester, Program Board’s Speakers Committee requested $7,000 in addition to their allocated budget from USC’s Undergraduate Student Government at Tuesday night’s Senate meeting.
USG could not reveal the name of the speaker they were negotiating with because of contractual obligations.
Beibei Bai, director of the Speakers Committee, presented a proposal to the Senate, which has the capacity to finance the event with money from its allocations fund. Program Board will supply the majority of the money needed for the event, but the Speakers Committee budget is not sufficient enough to completely fund the speaker’s visit, Bai said.
“My job is to bring speakers on campus, but speakers tend to be very expensive if they’re big enough to draw a crowd,” Bai said. “With my budget, I have to plan at least eight events a year, so I have a very limited budget to plan events, so it happens very often that we request money from USG.”
The Speakers Committee plans events throughout the year and allocates portions of its budget as each event materializes, Bai said. In terms of this speaker, the committee has been planning the visit since the beginning of the year, but using a majority of its budget to fund the event would prevent the committee from hosting other quality events for the year, she added.
Several assemblies from Program Board will likely contribute portions of their individual budgets and additional programming ideas to this event. Program Board officials hope to encourage co-sponsorship of events between assemblies and student groups this year, said Joseph Zuniga, executive director of Program Board.
“Speakers [Committee] is one of those that gets a high volume for co-sponsorships because it’s across the board,” Zuniga said.
The reputation of the proposed speaker for this event had a positive impression on many senators at Tuesday night’s meeting. But some, like Residential Senator Sam Nagar and Commuter Senator Jean Doh, said they wanted to ensure Bai and the Speakers Committee had considered other funding options before coming to the Senate.
Although the Speakers Committee could ask other Program Board assemblies for a larger portion of their finances or seek help from a sponsor outside of USC, Bai said she avoided taking either of these routes in order to preserve other assemblies’ budgets and to ensure the event would remain free for USC students.
“It’s not an outlandish request,” Bai said. “We’re not asking USG to fund it. We’re asking for additional support.”
Zuniga said he hopes the Senate approves the funds for the event, primarily because doing so would foster further collaboration between the legislative and programming branches of USG.
“When we try to bring speakers, it’s helpful sometimes to go to the Senate for a number of reasons. Senators are a voice of the large constituency,” he said. “To co-program an event like this is important to us, and I think it kind of bridges a gap between legislative and programming, and I really like it for that reason.”
The Senate will vote on the funding proposal next week.

The sound of sneakers fills the gymnasium as pass after pass is made. The ball zips across the court. The player receives it, dribbles and fires another sharp pass.
This is just another typical night for the USC Futsal team, the university’s indoor soccer club. It’s a Wednesday night practice, and practice makes perfect. There’s more agility and fancy footwork than Christiano Ronaldo can bargain for. The pace is quick — one flutter of the eye and the ball is cutting through the air to the back of the miniature version of what seems to be a soccer goal.

The futsal club is a relatively young club at USC. It was started only four years ago, but its popularity since then has been on the rise — and so has its ambition.
“Going from not even being a sport on campus or anything that the school has heard of to having 80 guys come out for tryouts is a really good thing for us,” said senior Dustin Tetzl, president of the club.
In two of its first four seasons, the team placed second in the men’s league. No team wants to be second best — especially twice in a row — and the Trojans were no exception.
“Second place is just first to lose,” said senior Henrique Malvar, who also serves as the team’s coach.
The coach’s disdain for the past season has translated into a burning desire to be number one.
This year is different from past years. The spirits are high and the team expects and hungers for champion status.
“We have physicality, we have speed and we have some players with excellent ball skills,” Tetzl said.
With the team improving every game, and from the display at their practice, the No. 1 spot may be within reach this season.
“I do see us winning the league. I have no question about winning the league,” Malavar said. The Nike 5 Tournament is another thing. Hopefully we will win it.”
Even though the team is in great shape and has high hopes, Malvar continues to push the team to be better.
“We can improve. There are only a few games where we have played how we are supposed to, even though we’ve won 10-1, 9-1,” Malvar said.
Malvar knows his team has much work to do, especially if they are to take first place at the Nike 5 Tournament. Despite its progress, the team still has its kryptonite.
“[Attacking] is also our weakness; since most of the players are forward or attacking midfield players, our defense is definitely our weakness,” Malvar said.
Despite lacking in the defensive department, there is an enormous improvement from prior seasons.
“The way we have been playing this year is miles better than we had in the past,” Malvar said.
The credit to this success has been the new changes that were brought on this season.
The team has adopted the Brazilian philosophy of joga bonito — play beautifully. With this newfound philosophy at the core of their style of soccer, the team’s overall way of playing the game has changed.
“Keeping the ball has been a big tactical change. We want to always have the ball and try to play nice and beautiful every single time,” Malvar said.
Possession is key in the Trojans’ success. As Malvar had pointed out, because of the small space in futsal, playing the ball back — as opposed to always attacking forward — is actually desired and preferred in order to have better success at scoring.
The success of the futsal team to date has captured the attention of the futsal world.
“We were invited to a tournament in New Zealand, unfortunately it was over the summer and a bad time for the players,” Malvar said.
With invitations to high-level tournaments, the USC Futsal team is slowly making itself into one of the elite teams in the nation. To prove and develop their skills further, the Trojans are currently working to set up the first intercollegiate tournament here in California.
Whether the Trojan Futsal team can fulfill its potential is yet to be seen, but they are certainly not lacking confidence. Although the majority of the squad is composed of upperclassmen, the Futsal team also believes that rookie prospects will carry the torch, allowing the Trojans to continue to dominate in future seasons.

Football writer Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz breaks down the Pac-10.
With the potential return of LeGarrette Blount, will Oregon be able to contend with USC for a Pac-10 championship this year? 
Pundits change their minds about Oregon more often than the Ducks change their uniforms.
After the Boise State debacle, the multicolored crew seemed destined for a rebuilding season. Then Oregon coach Chip Kelly strung together a few wins against capable Purdue and Utah teams. After dismantling Cal, the Ducks are being mentioned as USC’s top contender for the conference throne.
Junior quarterback Jeremiah Masoli has led the resurgence with confident play that was lacking from the offense earlier in the year. And even though its defense has been hobbled by injuries, the Ducks have found answers to early-season issues on that end, too.
A Halloween trip to Autzen Stadium looms large for the Trojans, especially given the recent buzz about the potential reinstatement of senior Oregon running back LeGarrette Blount.
The Ducks’ top offensive threat was thought to be sidelined for the year after punching Boise State linebacker Byron Hout and engaging in a postgame melee with Boise State fans. But Kelly announced last week that Blount had an opportunity to return to the playing field if he fulfills certain requirements.
But even if the star running back can meet the conditions, Blount has been ruled out to return before Nov. 7 — a week after the Trojans go to Eugene, Ore. Kelly has drawn criticism for retreating from the supposed season-long ban, but the coach deserves praise if he’s willing to keep Blount out of what might turn out to be the Pac-10 game of the year.
The Ducks can beat USC without Blount — the team’s other running backs have found their stride and “The Zoo” is a notoriously treacherous setting for road teams. And because the team gets USC, Arizona State and Oregon State at home with Cal already in the rearview mirror, Oregon can see its path to the Rose Bowl ahead.
But even if Oregon gets Blount back, the Trojans will likely enter the game as the favorite — assuming both teams win out over the next two weeks.
Can Stanford keep on winning?
Quick — name the team at the top of the Pac-10 standings.
It’s a bit of a trick question, because three teams are still undefeated in conference play. But at 3-0, Stanford finds itself in unfamiliar territory — first place.
The Cardinal has gotten off to a fast start by establishing a clear team identity. Senior Toby Gerhart is the offense’s workhorse at running back and freshman Andrew Luck comes up with enough critical plays in the passing game to keep the attack balanced. A scrappy defense and great special teams play have made the early going easy.
But Stanford might be in for a rude awakening in the second half of the season.
The team’s schedule is backloaded, with games against USC and Oregon still to come. By the time the Cardinal faces Cal and Notre Dame at the end of the season, it might be lucky to have barely made itself bowl eligible.
This is coach Jim Harbaugh’s best team in his three years at Stanford. But the team’s lone loss at Wake Forest shows how far it has to come.
Until the Cardinal can beat the conference’s best on the road, it won’t be able to break through to the upper tier of Pac-10 teams. Barring that breakthrough, the team should be happy to simply compete for a shot at the postseason.
