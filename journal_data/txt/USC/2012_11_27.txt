On Sunday, the USC men’s basketball team took on No. 23 San Diego State. It was a tale of two halves for the Trojans, who looked absolutely abysmal in the opening 20 minutes of action before coming all the way back and nearly winning the game. Ultimately, the Aztecs pulled out a 66-60 victory at the Galen Center.
The Trojans fell to 3-3 with the loss to SDSU, and have generally failed to impress early in the season. They easily disposed of the clearly less talented teams they’ve faced —Coppin State and Long Beach State — and squeaked out an overtime win against an undermanned Texas squad. But the University of Illinois blew out USC by a final score of 94-64, and Marquette also had their way with the Trojans in the consolation bracket of the Maui Invitational. There are plenty of red flags popping up over the Trojans’ relatively slow start, making USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s hot seat even hotter. But I’d maintain patience with this team, which has shown some flashes of being a possible contender in the Pac-12 this winter.
USC’s schedule isn’t going to get any easier—in fact, it looks even more difficult now than it did before the season started. Its next game is a road matchup against 4-1 University of Nebraska. Then it’s two straight battles against top 25 schools — No. 25 New Mexico and No. 21 Minnesota. After a few filler games, Pac-12 play kicks off on Jan. 3.
In the end, though, that tougher schedule will aid the Trojans if they hope to muster any sort of run at the NCAA tournament. Quality wins against top 25 schools would be a huge lift to a March Madness resume, however unlikely that might appear now. USC surely gained some confidence after hanging tough with SDSU in what was practically a neutral court thanks to a large and vocal turnout of Aztec fans. The Trojans are still meshing together lots of new pieces, but they’re more than capable of taking down a borderline ranked squad.
It’s also important to remember the Trojans, especially senior point guard Jio Fontan and junior guard J.T. Terrell, just haven’t shot the ball well. Terrell leads the team at 12.5 points per game but is shooting just 31 percent from the floor, nearly identical to his 3-point percentage. Fontan, meanwhile, is putting up 7.7 points per game on an incredibly low 23 percent of his attempts. Two years ago, he knocked in 41 percent of his shots. That number is going to stabilize sooner or later, even if the point guard struggles to totally make it back to his pre-2012 numbers (he missed all of last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament). Terrell, on the other hand, is trying to adjust back to Division 1 competition after a year at the junior college level.
“For the most part J.T. has been taking some of his shots, shots that he makes on a consistent basis,” Fontan said after USC’s loss to San Diego State. “They just haven’t been falling. As for myself, I just have to play better. It’s been a rough couple of games, I just have to make more shots. I just have to be a better player.”
It’s very possible expectations for USC’s backcourt — Terrell especially — might have been slightly overblown. But if Fontan and Terrell can muster anywhere near solid shooting nights, the Trojans will be awfully tough to beat with an inside game featuring three 7-footers and talented senior forward Eric Wise. Wise in particular has been an unexpected bright spot for USC, averaging 11.3 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. He’s also second on the team in assists and has generally been the only consistent performer on the roster.
Regardless of what you think of O’Neill’s coaching tenure at USC, the one thing he constantly preaches is strong defense, and that’s not going to change anytime soon. Illinois annihilated the Trojans to the tune of 94 points, but it was an anomaly of a shooting performance, as the Fighting Illini shot nearly 70 percent in the first half and knocked down 13 3-pointers for the game.
For the most part, USC has put out a solid interior defensive unit and seems to be improving in the rebounding department. The only thing missing is more consistency scoring the ball, plain and simple. This isn’t last year’s roster — there are legitimate division-one options who just aren’t making shots right now. When those players do start converting, the Trojans can begin molding together a possible March Madness resume.

Interesting. What I care about is this: I am a type 1 diabetic. My feet were going to be amputated. until I found a simple way to stop that from happening.  if you are a diabetic you need to read this blog:

This article forgot to mention that SDSU’s best perimeter shooter who is the best defender on the team as a four year starter was out for the game. Another slight miss would be the fact that the Aztec’s starting center went out of the game with a hip pointer after the first five minutes in the game. Don’t get too excited.

The USC women’s basketball team went on the road for the first time this season after four consecutive games at the Galen Center to start the season, coming out with a 62-51 win over UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday night in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Off night · Senior forward Christina Marinacci scored only two points against the Gauchos on Tuesday night. The Women of Troy were able to escape Santa Barbara with an 11-point win. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Junior forward Cassie Harberts led the Women of Troy (3-2) with 17 points (11 in the second half), 5 assists, and 4 rebounds. Freshman guard Jordan Adams scored 12 points on four 3-pointers, and sophomore guard Ariya Crook finished with 9 points. Every USC player scored at least once, and Harberts finished with double-digit points for the fifth straight game.
“My teammates found me when I was open,” said Adams. “I had a lot of time in the pocket. They didn’t run out to me and my teammates did a really good job finding me outside.”
Angela Aguirre finished with 13 points to lead the Gauchos (2-4) in scoring. Kendra Morrison scored 11 points, all in the second half, and Destini Mason had nine points and five rebounds.
USC finished the first half on a 14-4 run to take a 31-22 lead at the half, with Harberts, Adams, and junior forward Desiree Bradley all scoring six points each. The Women of Troy shot 50 percent (12-for-24) from the field, including 5-of-8 from behind the arc, compared to UCSB’s 37.5 percent (9-for-24). Both teams only went to the line twice at the half, with each team making both free throws.
The Women of Troy held the cushion throughout the rest of the game, thanks to Harberts’ 10 points in the first seven minutes of the second half.  Crook scored all nine of her points after halftime, and USC narrowly outscored the Gauchos 31-29 in the second half to seal a comfortable win. USC led by as many as 18 with eight minutes left, but a 13-1 run by the Gauchos pulled the deficit to single-digits before a 3-pointer by Destinie Gibbs with 48 seconds left ended any chance for a comeback.
“They made our runs and we made our runs back,” said junior forward Cassie Harberts. “A lot of it was just defensive coverages. We didn’t do what we needed to do.”
USC continued to improve in the turnover column, finishing the game with only 12 turnovers, compared to 15 and 18 in its last two games, along with 14 fouls. The Woman of Troy finished shooting 48.9 percent (22 for 45) from the field, along with 58.3 percent (9 for 16) from 3-point range and 9 of 13 from the free-throw line. They outrebounded the Gauchos 28-22, marking the fifth-straight game the Women of Troy have outrebounded their opponent, as well as holding Sweets Underwood, the Gauchos’ second leading scorer, to 0 points on 0-for-4 shooting.
“You can’t win the game with a bunch of turnovers, and we really stressed taking care of the ball and valuing possessions,” said Adams, “When you turn the ball over, you beat yourselves.”
UCSB shot 20 for 42 from the field (3 for 6 from 3-point range), and 8 of 11 from the free-throw line. The Gauchos committed 13 turnovers and 12 fouls.
The Women of Troy go back on the road Friday to take on San Diego State (3-2) at 7 p.m. PT. USC’s next home game is Saturday, Dec. 15 against Texas A&M (3-3).

Children who were exposed to high levels of air pollution during their first year of life or whose mothers lived in environments with high levels of air pollution during pregnancy have a greater risk of developing autism, according to a recent study conducted by USC and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles scientists.
The study, “Traffic Related Air Pollution, Particulate Matter, and Autism,” suggests that exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy and the first year of life leads to a two-fold risk of autism. The study was published Monday online in the Archive of General Psychiatry and focused on the research done by a team composed of Keck, CHLA and UC Davis MIND Institute investigators.
“This work has broad potential public health implications,” said Heather Volk, the study’s principal investigator and  an assistant professor of preventative medicine at USC, in a release. “We’ve known for a long time that air pollution is bad for our lungs, and especially for children. We’re now beginning to understand how air pollution may affect the brain.”
Researchers examined the amount of near-roadway traffic pollution and measures of regional air quality, building on previous research by Volk and colleagues.
“We took into account how far away people lived from roads, meteorology such as which way the wind was blowing, how busy the road was, and other factors to study traffic-related pollution,” she said in a release. “We also examined data from air quality monitors, which measure pollution over a larger region that could come from traffic, industry, rail yards or many other sources.”
The study, funded in part by a grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, monitored children’s development and examined where families lived during each trimester of pregnancy and at the baby’s birth with relation to the proximity to major road or freeways.
This is the first study to affiliate exposure to vehicular pollutants with risks of autism. Other studies have examined the influence of air pollution during pregnancy and have concluded that it has physical and developmental effects on the fetus as well examining the effects of air pollution exposure in the first months of life, which has been connected to delay in cognitive development.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 57 percent increase in autism between 2002 and 2006. Historically, genetic factors have been considered the cause of autism, but recently there has been an increased awareness that increase in the developmental disorder could be because of other factors.
Volk and colleagues are now studying the relationship between genes related to autism and environmental exposures to identify any factors that could make people genetically more vulnerable to particular pollutants.
Our vanpool through VPSI uses a Ford Ecoline van model that has no separate recirculate setting on the climate control so unless the AC is set to MAX AIR, we are breathing road exhaust fumes the entire hour+ commute.

The intended meanings, backgrounds and implications of different images came up during a panel’s analysis of the use of traditional techniques and subjects in contemporary works of art in an event held at the USC Fisher Museum of Art on Tuesday night.
Viewpoints · Panelists analyze specific pieces of art and their inferred meanings at an event held at the Fisher Museum of Art on Tuesday. – Alex Rose | Daily Trojan
Jennifer Reynolds-Kaye, a doctoral candidate in the art history department, discussed the processes involved in her dissertation’s analysis of a piece by artist Tatiana Parcero that involved a black and white photograph transposed over a 16th century map of a town in Spain. Reynolds-Kaye traveled to the town on the map to gather more information, but she found residents did not have a significant understanding of their own history.
“Scholars at a university knew more about the town’s history than the citizens living there,” she said. “This led me to question the ethical responsibility of the artist and the art historian to the source.”
Reynolds-Kaye has since worked to return a copy of the map to the town and educate the residents about the history associated with it.
According to panelist Suzanne Hudson, an assistant professor of art history at USC, one of the biggest challenges in analyzing art with global elements was “to understand the culture in which [the art] was produced.”
Hudson’s presentation highlighted issues of feminism within several contemporary works by female artists.
Ana Paulina Lee, a doctoral candidate in USC’s department of comparative literature, discussed how the appropriation of traditional images in contemporary art functioned and whether the artist further perpetuates the original meaning of the image by including it in their own work.
The conversation directly related to art displayed in the Fisher Museum’s current exhibition, A Complex Weave: Women and Identity in Contemporary Art. The exhibition, which has been featured at the museum since Sept. 5, explores the complex question of identity reflected in the work of contemporary women artists.
The exhibition features 16 artists and includes several mediums such as photography, video, sculpture and printmaking.
Nickolas Alarcon, a junior majoring in psychology and critical studies, said the event shed light on many of the pieces he has seen displayed in Fisher Museum this semester.
“I’ve been [to the Fisher Museum] a few times before and never really understood the art, so it was nice to hear a new perspective about the pieces from experts,” Alarcon said. “[Contemporary art] is something I don’t usually pay attention to, but it was really nice to hear what these graduate students are doing with studies in art.”

Christopher Carpenter, an associate professor of economics and public policy at UC Irvine, discussed Tuesday his latest research, which finds — among other things — that legal recognition of same-sex marriage affects homosexuals’ choices to marry but does not lead to a decline in heterosexual marriage.
Just married · Christopher Carpenter, an associate professor of economics and public policy at UC Irvine, discussed the effects of gay marriage in Massachusetts on nationwide equality trends during an event Tuesday. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Carpenter spoke at an event hosted by USC’s Center for Health Policy and Economics as part of its Quintiles Health Policy Seminar Series. His research, which examines the effects of legalizing same-sex marriage, focused on the states of California and Massachusetts.
In Massachusetts, Carpenter said gay marriage has had no effects on the marital rates of straight women.
“There are no negative deleterious effects on heterosexual marriages, at least as measured by the proportion of women that get married,” Carpenter said.
He said his research found an increase in the rate of lesbians who identify themselves as married after Massachusetts legalized gay marriage.
“Legalized same-sex marriage induced both bisexual women and lesbian women, particularly bisexual women, to tie the knot,” Carpenter said. “There is some proportion of lesbian women who say that they are married even in the period when [same-sex marriage] was not legal, and those are probably people in long-term relationships, who consider [themselves] married.”
His findings showed a similar trend in marriage rates for men, Carpenter said.
Carpenter’s presentation covered a wide range of issues concerning same-sex marriage, including data showing differences between male and female LGBT populations.
One such difference was the differences in marriage rates of gay men and lesbians. Carpenter referred to a graph that showed a greater increase in lesbian marriages than in marriages of gay men.
“This basically says that gay guys don’t formalize,” Carpenter said. “So lesbians formalize and gay guys don’t.”
One reason for this trend, Carpenter suggested, is that lesbian women are more likely to have children in their household compared to gay men.
“Legal benefits to marriage if you have kids are enormous, whereas the legal benefits if you don’t have kids … are not as large,” Carpenter said. “So that’s what we think is going on as to why the lesbian increase is way bigger than the gay increase.”
He also pointed out bisexuals were a minority among the male LGBT population, but not the female population.
The presentation followed a free-flowing format where those in attendance were allowed to ask about research and make suggestions for improvements that could be made to his research. Carpenter’s research is not yet complete but will be published shortly after its finalization.
It’s been noted that the attitudes towards LGBT persons by younger adults is pretty accepting. It’s now not a question of “if” but “when” as far full LGBT rights is concerned as the old attitudes essentially die off. A basic human right is the consensual choice of who you can love as an adult. It will be a wonderful day when all sexual roles/gender preferences are mainstreamed.

Undergraduate Student Government finished its Tuesday night meeting by passing all legislation on its agenda, including a funding request and a resolution.
Advocacy · Commuter Senator Vicken Antounian and Speaker Pro Tempore Matthew Arkfeld present the tuition representative resolution at Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government meeting. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The funding request applies to the USA Today readership program, and the resolution passed applied to the conflict-free minerals.
The USA Today readership program has been available to students since late October. The program is currently in its trial stage, and will end within the next two weeks. The program costs $2,760 every 20 days and provides 300 papers each day. The USA Today readership program, along with The New York Times readership program, gives students on campus access to free newspapers.
The conflict-free mineral resolution, which was sponsored by senators Jasmine McAllister and Matthew Arkfeld, encourages the university’s administration to purchase conflict-free minerals, often used in electronics, and to reduce the economic support to the current genocide occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo because of the deadly scramble for minerals.
The resolution urges the administration to issue a statement acknowledging the link between the products they buy and the violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Additionally, the resolution asks the administration to encourage its business partners to also forgo buying these products.
Other cities and colleges, such as Stanford University and Pomona College, have implemented this policy. The resolution will be passed onto President C. L. Max Nikias and other administration members.
The Campus Affairs committee also presented a resolution to appoint a student representative to attend meetings regarding tuition. Senator Vicken Antounian and Arkfeld sponsored the resolution.
The university’s undergraduate tuition rate rose 70 percent from 2001 to 2011, which is about $1,700 per year. Proponents hope the addition of a student representative would better inform students to the reasons behind the tuition hikes.
“If you’re paying for something you want to know what you’re getting in return,” Arkfeld said. “That goes into education as well. You know you’re getting a great education going into USC, but we just want to alleviate stress and discomfort that the students and their parents might have when it comes to paying for it.”
Wiley Strahan, director of campus affairs and a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, believes the student voice on tuition costs will benefit the entire student body.
“It’s important for students to have a voice in their tuition,” Strahan said. “It will be less about why tuition is raising, but what factors go into raising tuition.”
The UC schools have one student representative on the system’s board of regents, the body responsible for setting the tuition rates. Similarly, Duke University has a comparable initiative that determines student tuition rates.
Strahan hopes a vote for the student tuition resolution will give the university an opportunity to be an innovator and leader among private universities in California. Strahan also believes the students will respond positively to this possible enhancement.
“They’ll welcome this change,” Strahan said. “They will like having their input heard by the administrators.”
If passed by the senate, the resolution will be delivered to the university’s administration and board of trustees. The student member on the board will be appointed by USG President Mikey Geragos for a one-year term and be selected to represent students’ opinions on the topic of tuition, according to Strahan.
The resolution guidelines also stipulate that the student tuition representative attend at least one student senate meeting to present the estimated cost of attendance for the upcoming year. This requirement will help bridge the gap between student government and the administration in regard to tuition costs.
Logan Heley, the assistant director of campus affairs and a sophomore majoring in history and broadcast and digital journalism, also projects the administration will benefit from this possible position.
“This will be overall beneficial to students, trustees and all stakeholders at USC because administrators can get a student perspective on how the decisions they’re making is impacting students,” Heley said. “It will increase the dialogue between administrators, students and parents.”
The senate will vote on the resolution regarding a representative for student tuition next Tuesday.
Presentations by academic affairs, alumni affairs and university affairs were also made at Tuesday’s meeting.

Directed by Michael Matthews, The Santaland Diaries creates an immensely enjoyable and hilarious one-man play experience. In its fourth year of production by the Blank Theatre, the play is an adapted version of David Sedaris’ essay of the same name first read on NPR 20 years ago. Paolo Andino, who is perfectly suited for the role, returns for a second year as David (or Crumpet, his elf-name), a struggling writer who recently moved to New York City and is in desperate need of a job, even if it’s a ridiculous one: an elf at Macy’s Santaland.

Since he is the only actor in the piece, the play hinges on Andino’s performance, and he remains highly believable and completely over-the-top — but in a good way. Because of the absence of performers, audience members become characters in the narrative. Andino continually breaks the fourth wall and interacts with members of the audience when referring to other characters.
At some shows, he even brings audience members onstage and treats them as if they were children waiting to see Santa. This whole bit could easily be cringe-inducing and embarrassing, but Andino remains charming and possesses a keen ability to make volunteers feel comfortable and daring onstage. Needless to say, such spontaneous occurrences are the highlights of the show.
Since audience participation is such a big part of the performance, the play differs slightly from night to night. Still, Andino, as a great improviser, feeds off the energy and reactions of the audience. Moreover, the small theater makes the experience feel very intimate, and viewers get the impression that Andino makes eye contact with every single person in the audience.
The juxtaposition of David’s irreverence and cynicism with the enthusiasm and self-importance of many of the people around him adds gut-bustingly funny elements to The Santaland Diaries. He never takes his job seriously, and the comedy enhances the absurdity through the breaking down and demystification of the department store Santa in his (un)natural, commercial habitat.
Andino is highly entertaining in his extremely specific portrayals of the small characters in the play. He employs unique mannerisms and ways of speaking that immediately bring the characters to life, though they’re all played by the same person. Viewers can feel each person’s history and understand exactly who they are based solely on how Andino stands and talks as he embodies each of them; he superbly balances these big impressions with David’s dry disbelieving nature.
David also deals with crazy parents who care more about their own agendas than their children’s experience of visiting Santa, either by forcing them to say that what they want for Christmas is for Procter & Gamble to stop torturing animals, or by controllingly directing photographs with Santa. David also has to interact with many different kinds of Santas, including one deeply frightening and borderline insane Santa who stays in character even when no one else is around and forces David to sing Christmas carols even when the children don’t want him to. This interaction leads to an amazingly bizarre rendition of “Away in a Manger” in the voice of a demented Billie Holiday — another high point of the show.
Throughout all of this, what sustains David is a sense of superiority, paychecks and the fact that some of his fellow elves and Santas can share stories with him about their experiences working on One Life to Live, apparently his favorite TV show and dream job. The fact that Andino had a recurring role on the show adds to the humor of David’s extraordinarily detailed imaginings of what it would be like to work on One Life to Live.
David views most of what happens throughout the play as extremely superficial. The associations and situations he confronts every day are something to deride and ridicule. And to be fair, they are ridiculous. Santaland seems to magnify the workers’ insanities. At the end of the play, however, David works with a Santa he’s never met before, one who doesn’t seem to have a real name and who elevates the proceedings to something spiritual. He never once asks what a child wants for Christmas — such material things are unimportant. He instead focuses on the child’s relationship with his or her parents and how loving and fulfilling this relationship is.
Parents cry tears of joy, and for the first time in his life David feels like a good person, if only by association. Here, The Santaland Diaries offers a stereotypical message of “the true meaning of Christmas.” It’s trite, but it works.
This is especially true given that David’s relationship with the “real” Santa creates the first genuine experience he has in Santaland. It’s the first time people leave Santa’s house grateful, not frustrated or angry. It’s the first time neither he nor his Santa are lying to their patrons. It’s David’s job to lie to people, to pretend everything is merry and beautiful, so this real and unfamiliar experience throws him for a loop — but an admittedly good one. We see another side to David’s character here, a deeper, more human side that doesn’t have to make jokes just to get through the day. By the end of the play he’s not just a snarky and entertaining man-elf. Similar to the way audiences glows with innocent joy from watching The Santaland Diaries, David walks away as a purveyor of the holiday spirit.
 
The Santaland Diaries runs through Dec. 16 at The Stella Adler Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard.

The level of ambition through the Assassin’s Creed series is commendable — not only in the incredible amount of detail in rebuilding past civilizations, like Jerusalem during the Crusades or Rome in the midst of the Renaissance, but also in its dedication to history. In the games, these past events not only become exciting and intense but also suggest that the series is knowledgeable of its respective era. Compelling storytelling, a fun combat engine  and a wealth of genre elements have also become hallmarks of the series.
Ubisoft continues the blockbuster stealth-action franchise with Assassin’s Creed III. The game takes place against the backdrop of the American Revolution, starting at the beginning of the French & Indian War and lasting until the end of the Revolutionary War.
It’s an era that’s criminally unexplored in video games, and the studio does an admirable job of expanding the landscape and core gameplay. In certain cases it tries to do too much, feeling at times unrefined and repetitive. Yet the moments of brilliance and the rebuilt combat still makes the game one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of the year.
Players inhabit the role of Connor Kenway (or Ratohnhaké:ton in his native tongue), a half-British, half-Mohawk warrior who seeks to revive the Assassins and protect his tribe against the latest iteration of the Templars. He ends up fighting alongside the Patriots in their war for independence; however, Connor soon discovers enemies on both sides and must do what he can in his pursuit for justice.
Connor has a clear motivation for his actions, and his dual-ancestry provides for a natural moral conflict, but it’s not easy warming up to him. The series’ previous main character, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, was charming, suave and a bit of a scoundrel, but Connor is often overly serious; players never really get a chance to experience his lighter side.
The character who does get more fleshed out is Desmond Miles — the present-day descendant of Connor, Ezio and the first installment’s Altair — who uses the Animus to access the DNA-based memories of his ancestors. With an impending end-of-the-world scenario, Desmond has more playable missions than in any of the previous games, and players finally get a conclusion to his story, even if it occurs a bit abruptly.
The presentation of historical figures and events in Assassin’s Creed III is very balanced yet ambiguous; it presents legendary icons like George Washington and Samuel Adams as complex individuals with at times contradictory motivations. The game provides an objective way of looking at American history and sheds light on an era that hasn’t truly been explored in video games or in movies. It says something that Ubisoft, a French-based studio, has made the most compelling story about the American Revolution in years.
The gameplay has been rebuilt and streamlined. Rather than having to hold two buttons to sprint, players only need to press one. Counter attacks and combat in general have been sped up, allowing you to dual-wield your weapons and eliminate soldiers at break-neck speed. And though the game doesn’t offer complex architecture for players to scale, climbing through the trees is a breeze.
The graphical and technological aspects of the game are quite an achievement; Ubisoft brings its trademark dedication to historical detail to 18th century colonial America, bringing cities like New York and Boston to life. Connecting all the major cities is a vast frontier packed with side-missions, secret items, trading posts and plenty of animals to hunt. Weirdly long loading times don’t diminish the scale and massive amount of content.
Assassin’s Creed III, however, locks users into the story for the first part of the game and most of the missions seem more strict and rigid than the previous entries of the franchise, making it harder to get full synchronization due to some really arbitrary guidelines. There’s still plenty to do and explore, with nearly 40 to 50 hours worth of gameplay, but it takes several hours to really explore the wilderness.
Multiplayer remains an addictive and inventive mode; the thrill of patiently waiting and plotting for the right moment to assassinate another player is a great change of pace from the insanity of a first-person shooter. The game introduces a new experience with Wolf Pack, a co-operative mode where players join forces to eliminate as many NPCs as you can. There’s even a dedicated story within the multiplayer mode.
The game is available for the Xbox 360, the Playstation 3, and is one of the launch titles for the Nintendo Wii U and PC. The Wii U version has slightly weaker graphics but uses the Gamepad for an enlarged mini-map and a quick means of accessing your inventory.
Assassin’s Creed III is perhaps the most ambitious entry of the franchise to date; and yet, just as it presents the Revolution as a war of odd occurrences and a great deal of luck, it too is a game that achieves a great many things while also making a few mistakes along the way. The potential of the series remains intact, and though Desmond’s story has “ended,” Ubisoft literally has the whole of human history to continue the franchise and expand even further.

At the beginning of the semester I wrote about auteurship, arguing that filmmakers need to strike a balance between mindless entertainment and films that are intentionally artistic.
Diverse directing · Ang Lee directs a scene for Life of Pi. His credits also include Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. – | Photo by Jake Netter, courtesy of 20th Century Fox
I argued that filmmakers need to find their identity — one that is recognizable as that of their own — so their work is distinct.
Ang Lee’s career, as a whole, has encouraged me to revise the way I understand auteurship, and what it means for filmmakers to have their own specific identity as artists.
Lee does not perpetuate one particular style. Instead, he stands as a testament for what filmmaking should be — versatile.
Lee doesn’t represent any one thing, but that’s exactly what defines him. And if auteurship is about creating your own specific identity, then Lee’s identity is versatility.
Just look at some of his most famous films.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a beautiful presentation of martial arts set in lush, stunning Asian backdrops. Hulk served as Lee’s chance to explore the action-adventure flick. Brokeback Mountain was a quiet drama in which Lee pushed narrative boundaries with a romance between two gay cowboys and was full of beautiful cinematography. Now, with this year’s Life of Pi, Lee has pushed himself with technology, using 3-D to add depth and dimension to his gorgeous work.
Though each film has its own individual flair, be it through its narrative or innovative use of technology, they are all stunningly beautiful. And though they are all well shot, each of Lee’s films are vastly different from each other, showing his ability to push himself out of his comfort zone.
Lee’s drive to innovate is exactly what Hollywood needs in filmmaking today.
This isn’t to say artists shouldn’t carry a personal style. Having a recognizable style of your own is great, of course, and it gives filmmakers a voice to call their own.
It’s safe to say that most filmgoers could smell a Quentin Tarantino or Joe Wright film from a mile away, simply because their works are that identifiable.
Tarantino engages with vastly different subjects — Nazis (and Nazi killers), slaves and assassins, to name a few — but he has made a name for himself with his quick wit and mash-up technique that compiles a series of styles into a single film. Wright, on the other hand, has made a career out of lavish, dramatic period pieces — cue Pride & Prejudice, Atonement and now Anna Karenina.
But creativity really flourishes when creative boundaries are pushed and a new set of eyes are applied to a genre or style.
Martin Scorsese, for instance, received rave reviews from critics and Oscar attention when he branched out of his crime-drama norm and experimented with a quirky children’s film, Hugo.
And now we have Ben Affleck. The triple-threat talent directed two Boston-based films, Gone Baby Gone and The Town. For Affleck, a Boston native, these films spoke to his experiences. Then, this year’s Argo came out, a film about the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis — quite a long way from Boston — and his popularity soared. Affleck, as actor, producer and director, went out of his comfort zone. The result: His period drama has been popularly and critically received as a refreshing and exciting political thriller that was well-acted and well-directed.
With certain filmmakers, you know what you’re going to get. And while that might be comforting because you’re more likely to enjoy a film, most people probably won’t want to see a re-creation — a near exact replica — of what has already been done before.
With awards season on the horizon, the film landscape seems to be flourishing: Silver Linings Playbook, Life of Pi, Hitchcock, Lincoln, Argo and so on.
Looking beyond the fall and winter wealth spring of great films, however, filmmaking could afford to be more dynamic. Yes, we had Moonrise Kingdom and Beasts of the Southern Wild premiering in the pre-Oscar season, but we also had Wrath of the Titans and (please, no more Katherine Heigl) One for the Money.
It takes an ambitious, driven and creative director to churn out dynamic films. But capable filmmakers need to push themselves to be more versatile so that their work becomes more creative as a result. Versatility should be the standard and not the exception to the norm; innovation is what we should seek. That being the case, filmmakers follow Lee’s example.

For one hour and 16 minutes, a chunk of glacier that is larger than the size of Manhattan breaks off an ice sheet and floats in pieces into the ocean. Massive blocks of ice overturn, submerge and emerge in frozen waters, with resulting seismic booms echoing throughout the environment.
Scaling science · Director Jeff Orlowski gathers raw footage for Chasing Ice in Survey Canyon, Greenland. The stunning visuals of the documentary highlight the realities of global warming while offering a hopeful message. – | Photo courtesy of Chasing Ice, LLC
Though this image might sound like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, it is, in fact, real. The largest documented incident of calving — the process through which glaciers break off into smaller pieces — is just one of the terrifying, haunting images in the new film Chasing Ice.
Chasing Ice documents, over a period of several years, the conception and evolution of The Extreme Ice Survey, a program founded by James Balog, a noted environmental photographer. The program serves to record the changes wrought on glaciers by climate change. Photographs that 27 cameras took of changing glaciers over the course of several years, interviews, on-the-ground footage and data modeling undercut the film, creating an experience that incorporates multiple media.
Though critics might dismiss Chasing Ice as the latest addition to the ever-increasing arena of climate change films, Chasing Ice emerges from the pack as a film of astonishing beauty and timely commentary.
The movie begins with cuts of various political pundits and talking heads arguing about the reality of global warming. Each segment jumps to a different TV personality, with each shot increasing in its fervor and rhetoric.
And just when the speech has reached a fever pitch, the film cuts to serene shots of Balog in his natural element: photographing ice formations in some of the most surreal and beautiful places on Earth.
It is this introductory sequence that encompasses all that makes Chasing Ice a movie that surpasses all other climate change-oriented films. Chasing Ice doesn’t seek to bash the viewer over the head with statistics or doomsday predictions, nor does it seek to relentlessly attack other viewpoints.
Because of this, the film serves as a departure from the highly emotional, hyperbolic dialogue that has come to characterize the debate about climate change. Chasing Ice shifts its gaze to one man and his team, showing how the persistent dedication of a few can result in incredible discoveries and scientific advances.
The movie documents, with sensitivity and honesty, the struggles that come with striving to record environmental changes in some of the world’s harshest environments. It also depicts the fight against perpetual ignorance and disregard toward the consequences resulting from climate change.
Chasing Ice isn’t simply about global warming. It’s about one man’s dedication to a cause greater than himself, and to the passion that has defined his life’s work.
In the end, however, it is Balog’s photographs that do all the talking.
Glittering ice, deep shadows, jagged edges and curvaceous layers speak to the diversity of ice formations throughout the world and provide viewers an unprecedented look at landscapes that will never be seen again in history, as global warming takes an ever-increasing toll on glacial formations.
Stark black and white imagery of shattering ice, sepia-tinted photos of glacier erosion that go on for miles and color photographs of layered ice that touch upon all shades of blue present some of the most spectacular environmental photography in recent memory.
In fact, the film’s impact can best be seen through drastic changes in audience behavior during the photo montages. An audience that had been perpetually cheering and booing various political pundits and sound bites descended into deathly quiet during these montages. But the beauty and tragedy of these images went beyond political sentiments.
Only an awestruck, respectful silence could capture the impact of Balog’s photography on viewers, many of whom might not have seen such images before. Chasing Ice reveals alien environments that are worlds away from American daily life, yet remain linked with the environmental changes we see all around us.
The delicate connections that bind glacier movements thousands of miles away with the natural disasters that affect us in the United States slowly emerge as the film progresses, and remind  us of the deeper connections people hold with the planet.
The realization of the scale of destruction that the world faces quietly emerges throughout the film, and the scope of damage comes as a shock to even Balog and his team. Images of attendees at Balog’s lectures, however, offer a degree of hope, from the look of horror across a child’s face to an interview with a former Shell employee who left his career because he was so affected by Balog’s work.
Chasing Ice should not be viewed as an excuse for inaction. It’s easy to lose hope when the mind-blowingly rapid pace of environmental degradation is laid out in front of you so clearly. But the viewpoint that all audiences should adopt can best be summed up in a response that the film’s director and producer, Jeff Orlowski, gave to an audience member during a Q & A after a Nov. 23 screening in West Los Angeles.
When asked if there was any hope for the world’s situation, Orlowski gave the analogy of an imminent car accident:
“If you’re driving a car, and you notice you’re about to crash into the car in front of you, you don’t just let it happen. You slam on the brakes. You know the accident will happen, but there is a difference in the amount of damage. Right now, the world has its foot on the accelerator, and it needs to step on the brakes.”
 
Chasing Ice began its run at the Nuart Theater on Nov. 23 and will continue until Nov. 29.
Maybe you have not heard of any such storms because you lack an education.

Correlation and causality are very very different things.  “Global warming” stopped 10 years ago,yet CO2 has kept increasing in our atmosphere.  Ill let you draw your own conclusions.
Klem.  Really?  Did you watch the film or are you paid to make posts?  Glaciers calve, yes.  Calving normally does not result in loss of ice as more comes every year.   Until now.
Until now, are you joking? Only 20,000 years ago the NA ice sheet reached all the way down to the 43rd parallel. Since that time, the ice has calved 6000 km to the north. That’s 6000 km of calving and you consider that ‘no ice loss until now’?
I think you’ve been over doing the Kool-aid.
BTW, I’ve watched the film and I am not paid to make posts. 
cheers
A glacier is a river of ice, when the river reaches the lake or ocean, it breaks off.  Otherwise the glacier would reach Australia by now.  New snow lands, old ice departs.  CO2 that everyone derides was highest in the Eocene period, at 10 times today’s levels, there were more mammals in greater diversity, than at any other time in Earth’s history.  There was no ice.  The dawn of the ice age, and end of the Eocene was marked by a plant which ate the carbon, and reduced the carbon by 90 %.  90% of the Mammals perished when this happened.  Rich Carbon atmosphere is beneficial to both plants and Mammals.  There has been no ice for 80% of the Earth’s history.  Ice is detrimental to plants and Mammals.  6000 years ago it was warmer than today.
That’s all fine and dandy but how do you explain mega-storms Katrina and Sandy?  These things have never happened before!
Don’t be a schmuck.  There have been many many storms just like those and worse than those before.  Keep in mind it seems as if more things are happening due to the advent of record keeping and global news.  There was a storm similar to Sandy in the 1930s.
I have never heard of any storms or the level of devastation we are currently experiencing.   Maybe you should stick to Chiropractic care Dr. Adams?
Well if you’ve never heard of them, then that is overwhelming scientific evidence that they never happened. And that’s good enough for me. See you at the pool.

There is a debate, because the science is inconclusive. One side of the debate is funded 90% by taxes – so what is the solution? MORE TAXES!?
Mars, and other planets in our solar system are having their temperature rise at similar rates.  No Hummers on Mars so the only common factor is the sun. 
The Earth has natural heating/warming cycles.  How many ice ages have we had?  And then what happened?  The Earth warmed up.  
The way “science” works is you need grants to receive funding.  Best way to get a grant is to research a politically charged issue, IE global warming.  
Remember climate-gate?  If global warming was so clear-cut they wouldn’t have had to fabricate their data.  
What’s the biggest contributor to global warming?  CO2? WRONG.  Water vapor.  Then the idiots say “Well CO2 causes warming, which then causes MORE water vapor, and more warming.”  But how much is CO2 contributing?  No one knows.  My guess is very little.  Percent CO2 in atmosphere:  .039%  Think about that.  PERCENT. 
Is the Earth warming?  Probably.  Is it human’s fault?  Probably not.  The Earth’s too big of an environment to test.  We can’t duplicate the Earth, and computer models are only as accurate as the programming. 
So why is global warming such a big issue?  EASY, wealth redistribution.  Cap and trade, etc.  A new tax for a select group of people to get very very rich.  
With all that said we should worry about reducing ACTUAL pollution….not a chemical that all the animals on earth exhale every second.
Here we go soon you will see the morons and industry paid propagandists come on and make their idiotic comments like:
Weather changes and weather has changed in the past
It is cosmic rays (for the tin foil hat crowd)
The climatologists have forgotten the obvious reflective clouds
The climatologist have forgotten the obvious solar cycles
I heard from Rush Limbaugh FOX etc that this is a hoax
It is a conspiracy by the US government and the worlds scientists 
It is a conspiracy by the worlds scientists to get rich
Follow the money & Ignore the milti-trillion dollars oil/coal/gas industries
Dems scientist thinks that they bees sooo smart but they don’t get it
Yet these guys cannot name one internationally or nationally recognized scientific organization that says global warming does not exist or that it is not caused by mankind.  There are none because it has already been accepted as fact in the scientific community.  You will not hear the idiots say that 98% of the climatologist say global warming is real.   What they will quote is a obscure web sites that quotes other PhDs in everything from geology to statistics to proctology.
Nearly all the sports pundits believed SC was #1 preseason.   Amazing how group thought works out for you people….
Yeah, just because every reputable scientist on the planet is screaming at the top of their lungs that we’re all about to die is no reason to stop believing coal lobbyists. Because lobbyists are ALWAYS honest. Scientists? Who knows?
The films are beautiful to watch, everyone should see them. But to conclude that calving glaciers is caused by human activity is unsupportable. Glaciers calve, that’s what they do, its normal. Suggesting that calving glaciers is somehow not normal or that glaciers today are calving at an alarming rate is reserved for the alarmist faithful only. The believers.
These beautiful films are evidence that glaciers calve only, they are not evidence that humans are the cause.
cheers

At last Saturday’s football game, dozens of student volunteers for USC Sustainability’s Tailgate Waste Diversion team learned the hard way that the university lacks waste consciousness.
If USC worked to develop a stronger recycling sensibility, however, it could have an incredibly positive environmental and community impact.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
The need for more effective waste management has never been more dire.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the city, which produces about 3.5 million tons of garbage annually, has to export more than 20 truckloads of sewage sludge a day to a plot of land in Kern County to comply with state laws calling for cities to divert half their waste away from landfills.
National waste management conditions are equally abysmal. Last summer, a report released by As You Sow, a nonprofit based in Oakland, Calif., said that despite nationwide recycling laws, $11.4 billion in recyclable materials still make it into U.S. landfills every year.
USC, as a wealthy and influential institution with a large environmental studies department, should be taking the lead on waste management efforts in Los Angeles. But instead, students continue to default to a culture of excess.
This is largely because USC needs more of a visible, comprehensive effort to encourage recycling or composting on a day-to-day basis. The university has intentionally exchanged full-size recycling bins on campus for computer-controlled equipment designed to separate the recyclables from the waste, but these machines cannot extract food waste that could otherwise be diverted as compost. Furthermore, USC Sustainability acknowledges on its website that “pre-sorting university waste can increase diversion of recyclables.”
What better way to encourage pre-sorting than to allow students to sort their trash into recycling and compost bins? Though game days offer this option, garbage cans still far outnumber compost and recycling centers, even though the vast majority of tailgate waste — food, Solo cups and aluminum cans — is 100 percent divertible.
Expanding the opportunity for students to divert their own waste will not only reduce the number of recyclable and compostable materials going to a landfill, but also cultivate habits of waste management that students will take with them beyond campus where there might not be a machine to do the work for them.
In addition to investing in more green and blue bins, USC should organize additional events to educate students on how to recycle and compost effectively. Public service announcements have already been made on game days encouraging tailgaters to waste responsibly, an effort that is commendable and necessary. The university could also include a waste diversion component in training for residential advisers and implement a program in the housing system.
These steps would not only positively impact the national waste dilemma, but could also have a community  impact through California’s Beverage Container Recycling Program.
Just a block west of campus on Jefferson Boulevard is a recycling center where, per California law, beverage containers subject to California Redemption Value can be exchanged for five cents if less than 24 ounces, and 10 cents if 24 ounces or larger.
This recycling center is the sole means of subsistence for many homeless people in the area. Particularly on game days, when recyclables abound, the neighborhood families in need will also take advantage of this service. Alternatively, students could return some of the containers themselves and use the proceeds to set up a community fund to provide meals to the homeless or sponsor beautification projects at local schools.
When we are in a position to do so much good for the environment and community, and when there is such a dire need for both the city and the nation to manage waste more effectively, there is no reason for USC not to lead the waste diversion charge. The university could implement volunteer programs where students distributes recyclables off-campus on weekends, or hire locals to assist with the recycling effort and let them keep what they collect.
We don’t encourage inefficiency in our academic or athletic departments. We shouldn’t do so when it comes to waste.

Ms. Bessey,
As an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California, I think you raise some very important issues that are affecting USC. Sustainability is a topic that needs to be sincerely grappled with to make a change. Your article began by citing specific statistics regarding the amount of garbage produced in Los Angeles, which was an important tactic to illustrate and set up the kind of problem that is at hand. An amount of 3.5 million tons of garbage is a lot of trash and a lot to handle. With these staggering statistics, it is important to question how, more generally, Los Angeles, and, more specifically, USC will be able to tackle the task, creating a more sustainable environment. Although your article questions the strength of USC’s recycling culture, my research shows that the university is on the right path. It offers big belly trash compactors, recycling programs, and new green tailgate programs during football games. Since your article raises questions regarding this need, how do you think the campus can raise awareness and make permanent changes? What could be considered enough? I would love to see specific examples of what this could look like.
Throughout this semester, I have been observing USC’s relationship to the community; however, it has not yet occurred to me that there is a significant connection between USC, the community, and the environmental efforts, which was a powerful piece of information to provide. As you mentioned, the Beverage Container Recycling Program appears to be an important way for the homeless in the area to make money; however, apparently there is a rule enforced by DPS preventing and arresting outside people from retrieving cans and bottles from on-campus trash bins for recycle.These community members are willing to help recycle those cans that are most-likely thrown into the wrong garbage cans, while providing themselves a means of survival. Do you believe this rule could be placing an invisible barrier between the university and its community? Your idea that students could return some of the cans to the center and then use these funds to help support the homeless will help USC further engage with the community. I question how difficult it would be to get students involved in this way. Nevertheless, this could be extremely powerful if implemented correctly. It could be started in specific environmental clubs, such as USC’s Environment First club, where students could spread this idea and set up events to recycle cans and use the money to benefit those in the surrounding community. I appreciate the concerns you bring up in your article.
Best,
Danica Ruberti
The author makes the mistake of conflating ” a culture of waste…” with not being environmentally conscious. These are not mutually exclusive. One of the reasons people tend to be turned off by all the talk about being environmentally friendly is that the sanctimony is really unbearable. I would like to know how often the author takes the public metro instead of driving the car she drives. Get real.
the hobos make an SC recycling program redundant. they’re already getting the job done.
Dear Francesca,
Please grow up and concern yourself with important issues.
Thanks,
Every USC student with a mental age of over 12 years
On my part, I take pride in the fact that I have never recycled anything (bottles, batteries, metal, glass, paper, etc.), and I plan never to do so. Pity any effort over the course of your life will be more than undone by me….
Curious:
1. Pride over such an insignificant thing?
2. Why not? Laziness?
Although there are some marginal benefits derived from recycling aluminum, recycling paper, for example, seems silly. Visit a tree farm and you will see that there is no shortage of paper—in fact, it takes less energy to produce new paper than to repurpose old paper. For some reason, people are convinced that old growth forests are being cut down to make copy paper. That just isn’t true.
@Dan
You can start by composting the coffee grounds at Starbucks when you get your first big job with your Environmental Studies degree!
Amen to everything above! As an Environmental Studies grad I can confirm that composting has been a long-standing item on our wish list. I remember carrying out a survey of freshman dorms in 2008- recycling awareness among the student body was embarrassingly low.

On Thanksgiving, Mexican President Felipe Calderón announced a formal proposal to change his country’s name from the lesser known, but official, “Estados Unidos de Mexico,” or  the United States of Mexico, to Mexico. This change could have a significant impact on the country and should be implemented so that Mexico can reaffirm its sovereignty and identity.
When did Mexico become the other United States? After gaining independence from Spain, the name became official in the country’s 1824 constitution, which was based on the United States’ federal system of government. Despite considering other names, such as “The Mexican Empire” and “The Republic of Mexico,” the country chose to adopt one that emulated its northern neighbors. But after Mexico lost more than half its land to the United States in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War, this emulation turned into resentment. Though Mexico and America still share close economic and geographic ties today, Mexico’s name has no place for vestiges of colonialism.
Calderón first proposed the name change as a congressman in 2003, but the bill was never put to a vote. The Mexico of today, however, is very different from the Mexico of 2003. Since assuming office in 2006, Calderón has focused his attention on cracking down on organized crime, promoting Mexico’s tourism industry and implementing long-term public works projects. His efforts have helped revive Mexico’s image as an attractive tourist destination, which in turn has attracted more businesses and manufacturing ventures. Mexico is carving out a place for itself in the global economy and deserves a name that reflects its growing status.
But critics are quick to point out the triviality of changing the country’s name: Mexico’s formal name is mainly for official use, such as on money and legal documents; the majority of the population, in Mexico and across the world, refers to the country as Mexico without a second thought. Thus, detractors say changing the country’s name is simply a symbolic, lame-duck move by a president with less than a week left in his term and should take the backseat to much more pressing issues, such as fighting intense drug violence and alarming poverty rates.
Changing the country’s name, however, will have far-reaching, significant consequences. Though it is not a cure for the country’s more serious issues, the change will reaffirm Mexico’s independence, which is crucial to strengthening the country’s credibility in diplomacy. Not to mention the fact that Mexico is a growing global economic force breaking out of the shadow of the United States, and it must be recognized as such. According to The Wall Street Journal, the country’s rapidly growing Gross Domestic Product will surpass Germany’s in the next 25 years. The country merits a name that accurately reflects its modern economic and political identity.
The incoming president, Enrique Pena Nieto, should continue to advocate for the name change to further the country’s global reputation.
A name is more than a mere formality. It carries weight and should be an accurate reflection of what it represents. As Calderón said Thursday during a news conference, “Pardon the expression, but the name of Mexico is Mexico.”

In related news, President Obama has announced a formal proposal to change his country’s name from the widely-known, but antiquated, “United States of America,” to the increasingly appropriate “United States of Mexico.”
