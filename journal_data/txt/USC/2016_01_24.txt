If you are anything like me, you get tired of the same old campus dining options. Simply put, there are only so many Lemonade cookies and Seeds paninis a girl can consume. If that’s the case, head over to Grand Central Market in downtown Los Angeles. This enormous open-air market is a foodie’s paradise. Bonus: it is only about a 10-minute drive from USC’s campus.
The first time I went, I felt immediately overwhelmed by the bustling crowds and more than 45 food vendors. Did I want a juicy burger, a breakfast sandwich, tacos or gourmet ramen? I spent nearly an hour taking laps around the market and reading different menus before deciding on a meal. Since then, I have taken many trips to Grand Central Market — and spent basically all of my money at food stands. Now I feel confident in my list of best food vendors to help first-time customers navigate the sea of options.
1. Eggslut
You’ve probably seen photos from this iconic breakfast spot on Instagram. After devouring The Fairfax sandwich with eggs, chives and sriracha mayo in under twenty seconds, I can confirm that this popular food stand lives up to the hype.

2. Sticky Rice
Head over to this funky vendor if you’re craving authentic Thai street food. They offer everything from papaya salad to Pad Thai to mango rice. To make things even better, this vendor uses organic and locally sourced ingredients in every dish.

3. Horse Thief BBQ
This may be on the list because the Texas-inspired meals remind me of home, but hey, my delicious brisket sandwich with fennel slaw tasted like real Texas barbeque. Everyone should give it a try.

4. McConnell’s Fine Ice Cream
Who doesn’t love creamy, old-fashioned ice cream? McConnell’s offers creative ice cream flavors like churro con leche, eureka lemon and marionberries and toasted coconut almond chip. Skip the cup and get your scoops in a freshly baked waffle cone!

5. Tacos Tumbras a Tomas
Having grown up in Texas, I’ve eaten my fair share of tacos, and Tacos Tumbras a Tomas is at the top of my extensive list! This small food stand serves inexpensive, authentic tacos with generous amounts of meat. Their carnitas and carne asada tacos are a must.

Zoe Brown | Daily Trojan
John Kabat-Zinn, University of Massachusetts Professor and creator of the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program at, said that “Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way; on purpose, in the present moment and nonjudgmentally.”
Ever since a friend introduced me to the practice of mindfulness last year, I’ve become obsessed. I want always to be present, to be here in this moment. I’m no master, but I’m trying everyday to be more in touch with myself, my thoughts and the world around me. 
Here are some tips I’ve found throughout my practice to be helpful in developing a more mindful lifestyle in the midst of a crazy, daily college life:
1. Phone time should only be for alone time
I know that texting is great and that Instagram is really cool and all, but being so caught up in the virtual world takes away from your presence in the present world. Whether you’re walking to class by yourself or eating lunch with friends, you can never be fully present if you’re allowing your phone to be a distraction from what is going on around you. Wait to answer your texts and check your social media feeds until you have a second to be alone.
2. Take time to reflect on your day
Yes, we’re college students and inherently, we’re busy — like, all the time. Sometimes we feel like we don’t even have time to eat meals. But if you decide that reflecting on your day — through meditation, writing or simply thinking — is something that you want to do, find a way to make time for it in your schedule, as you do with homework and studying. Sit down right before you go to sleep and allow your thoughts to flow. Consider what you liked about your day and what you didn’t. 
3. Accept your feelings
Before reacting badly to negative feelings, first accept them. Understand that feelings may arise but also that these feelings will fade in time. Nothing is permanent. The world is constantly changing and so are you. Breathe and think before you execute your reaction to anything. 
4. Focus on your breathing
Take time each day to notice and focus on your breathing. Sit down (I like to sit on the edge of the fountain outside of Doheny Memorial Library). Listen to the sounds around you, feel that your feet are on the ground, notice things you may not have noticed before and realize that you are alive and here right now. 
5. Be conscious of what goes into your body and your mind
Remember that you only have one body and one mind, and that you have to take care of both. Try your best to think about people, things and situations without judgment. Rather than looking at a passing person and making assumptions, just recognize that he or she is here in the moment just as you are. 
6. Focus on the present moment
Focus on one thing at a time so that you can be aware of what is going on around you. Instead of just seeing things as you go about your daily routine, actually look at the things you see. Don’t get stuck in your head thinking about what you need to do later or what you did in the past because now — right now, this moment, this second — is all that you have. So be there, be engaged and realize how lucky you are to be here in this moment. Don’t spend all your time working toward something that eventually will make you happy or make you feel good – there is no one big moment that you’re working toward in your life. The moment is every moment. 
7. Be curious
Ask questions. Read books. Listen to stories. Learn something just because you want to, not because you need to. Take in new scenery, new language, new smells, tastes and sounds. Most importantly, get to know yourself. Realize what you like, what you don’t like, what you wish you could do and what you wish you could change. Learn about yourself just like you would learn about any of your friends.

It seems that USC’s time in the AP Top 25 will be short lived after the Trojans dropped their second consecutive game, 85-70 to the Oregon State Beavers (12-6, 3-4) on Sunday afternoon.
The Trojans (15-5, 4-3) shot a horrific 33 percent from the field and had no answer for Oregon State’s Gary Payton II. The senior guard nearly had a triple-double, finishing with 22 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and four steals.
USC looked to be in control in the first half, growing its lead to to seven points with five minutes left in the half. Every time the Trojans looked poised to push their lead to double digits, however, the Beavers responded with a run of their own.
The Men of Troy ultimately took a 4-point lead into the half behind 19 bench points from the duo of Elijah Stewart and Chimeze Metu. USC had a hard time getting anything going on offense, but their ability to get to the free throw line (12-16) managed to be the difference in the first half.
Whatever Beaver head coach Wayne Tinkle said at halftime, it worked. The Beavers exploded out of the half, outscoring the Trojans by 13 points in the first five minutes of the second half en route to a 54-45 lead.
“I just tried to motivate the guys,” Payton said. “I told everybody to step up, and they responded.”
Beavers forward Tres Tinkle, who finished with 18 points and seven rebounds, scored 14 points in the second half, including two huge 3s during the Beaver’s second half opening run.
The Trojans continued to fight back in the second and half and twice cut the Beavers lead to six points. Every time the Trojans had the chance to get closer, however, they continued to miss opportunities, especially at the free throw line. The Trojans missed 10 free-throws and managed to shoot just 26 percent from the field in the second half.
An 8-0 run by the Trojans cut the Beavers lead to just six with four minutes left in the game. The Beavers, however, scored the next eight points and put the Trojans away for good. The win snapped a three-game losing streak for OSU.
USC has recreated itself this season under Andy Enfield, becoming a 3-point shooting specialist team. Their over-dependence on the 3-point shot ended up as their biggest demise against the Beavers.
The Trojans attempted 24 3-pointers on the night and converted just six of those attempts. Sophomore Elijah Stewart was the Trojans best player on the night, finishing with 16 points, nine rebounds and three 3-pointers.
A game after notching his first double-double, freshman Bennie Boatright struggled against the Beavers, finishing 1-7 from the field with seven points and six rebounds. Junior Nikola Jovanovic had his worst game of the season going 0-2 from the field with two points, four rebounds and four fouls.
USC’s 70 points were the least by wthe Trojans in a conference game this season.
With the loss, the Trojans fall into a tie for third place in the Pac-12. After playing five of their first seven conference games on the road, the Trojans will play five of their next seven at home, where they are undefeated on the season.
Next up for the Trojans is Washington State Thursday at the Galen Center. Tip-off is set for 7:30 P.M.

It was a mixed weekend for the Women of Troy. After falling 57-47 to a high-ranked Stanford squad, the team rebounded with a powerful second-half performance for a 61-47 victory over Cal.
The Women of Troy opened the weekend with one of their hardest matchups of the season against No. 12 Stanford. Despite starting the game with a 4-point lead, USC suffered from a six-minute cold streak while Stanford stretched out the lead. Forcing a total of 19 turnovers helped the Trojans to stay in the game, but they were unable to battle back and fell 57-47 in their third straight loss.
The true difference in the game was shooting. Stanford’s squad ended the game 46 percent from the field, while USC came in at 31 percent. The Women of Troy were able to chip down the Stanford lead to less than two points several times, but they were never able to take back control of the offensive tempo. Head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke attributed the team’s offensive struggles partially to confidence.
“It didn’t feel like we ever really believed that we could beat Stanford,” Cooper-Dyke said. “And that confidence is what you need to really get over that hump and take a lead and win a game against a team like [Stanford]. We learned that we can compete, but we also learned that we really need to find that confidence.”
Another factor in the team’s performance over the weekend was a loss of two critical players. The team was missing two starters for the second weekend in a row, with junior Jordan Adams and senior Brianna Barrett sidelined for eligibility issues. Adams and Barrett filled critical slots in the point guard role, and Adams added 13 points in the victory over UCLA, the last game she played.
One of the players stepping up in Adams and Barrett’s absence has been transfer post Temi Fagbenle, who led the team in both points and rebounds. Notching a total of 27 points over two games, Fagbenle hit double figures for the fifth game in a row in the loss to Stanford. Fagbenle’s contribution to the team has strengthened the post and cemented the team in the absence of key players.
“It’s been a difficult transition, especially with trying to find our chemistry and our new leaders,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We miss their defense, their offense, their leadership. We miss them as teammates. But in this situation, players have to step up and we have to make that adjustment.”
The adjustment began to show in the team’s Sunday matchup against Cal. The first half was slow for both offenses, with the Women of Troy shooting barely shooting 31 percent and scoring 26 points. In the second half, the team took off. Led by Fagbenle and sophomore guard Sadie Edwards, the Trojans exploded on offense, with the team’s shooting percentage climbing to 54 percent.
“We started to have more confidence in the second half,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We started to believe we could actually compete. I felt like the first two quarters, we were trying to figure out who we wanted to be, how we wanted to play. And the second half, we just competed and executed.”
Defense was the key difference in the team’s second-half play. Holding Cal to only six points in the fourth quarter, USC capitalized on offensive mistakes and converted 18 points off of turnovers. An increased defensive energy gave the team a taste of what their gameplay is going to look moving forward.
“We’re still, as a team, trying to find our identity of who we will be this season,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We have to continue to grow and really identify what this new USC Women of Troy look like.”

Last week, the Trojans men’s basketball team vaulted into the top 25, becoming nationally ranked for the first time in more than half a decade. With almost two-thirds of the season, the Trojans have shocked everyone, myself included, with their rapid improvement in head coach Andy Enfield’s third season.  Wins over Arizona and UCLA helped demonstrate the talent and potential of this year’s squad, but the recent losses to Oregon and Oregon State reminded all of the Trojan faithful that USC basketball is still not a finished product.
As I wrote earlier in the season, I thought this year could yield 18 wins for USC, which would be tremendous progress for Enfield. I thought the Trojans would win all but two or three of their non-conference games, which they did, but the play in the Pac 12 is what has been incredible surprising. At best, I felt USC would be in the middle of the pack, winning 9-10 conference games and just falling short of a tournament bid.
While a late season skid could still doom the Trojans and hurt their chances of a tournament bid — especially if losses like their defeat at Oregon State pile up — this season has solidified Enfield’s plan and vision for the team. Anything that happens beyond 18 wins should be considered a welcome surprise for the Trojan faithful, especially considering the sometimes unwatchable product we have been subjected to over the last four or five years.
The loss to Oregon was a reality check, as the Ducks are a very formidable opponent, and USC is not on the level yet where they can consistently beat good teams on the road. The fact that they are .500 on the road is a testament to the improvement in the program as a whole. Hopefully they can continue with this trend and end 5-4 or even 6-3 on the road.
USC is not yet where they need to be in order to be a perennial powerhouse in the Pac 12. They are young and relatively inexperienced, which is not Enfield’s fault in the least. They simply need to play more games and bulk up in the weight room. There are little things that they can improve: like beating a half-court trap more effectively or fronting the post, but those things take time to develop.
Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright have more than exceeded the expectations set for them entering their freshman campaigns, and the refined shots of Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin point to a program that is actually developing players, a rare commodity in college sports these days. All four of these players are local, which validates Enfield’s assessment that USC will rise or fall on the backs of Southern California talent.
A rational fan can only be positive about the trajectory of the Trojan basketball program. Enfield may not have the in-game ability to execute Xs and Os like Coach K or Tom Izzo, but he doesn’t need to be the shrewdest tactician to win games at the college level. If he can continue to recruit his type of guys — long forwards who can shoot and rangy big men — USC will be a force to be reckoned with.
Additionally, every player who is watching Slam City wants to come to USC. They look like they are enjoying themselves when they step onto the floor, which isn’t always the case at other schools. Additionally, USC isn’t getting top five recruits, which might be the model for sustained success in college basketball.
Having guys in college for at least two years and for most of the Trojans three or four will allow the team to gel and coalesce, giving them a major advantage over a bunch of freshmen who are looking forward to the NBA instead of focusing on the present.
The team isn’t perfect, and probably never will be. Football will always be the top dog in this town, but having a top 25 program would be a tremendous addition to the Trojan athletic universe. Enfield is smart, capable and young. He is still developing as a coach and a recruiter and his plan seems to be working. It’s hard to stop a team with four guys who have a legitimate chance of knocking down a 3-point shot. That is what teams like Arizona and UCLA with ballyhooed recruits are finding out in short order.
USC still needs to figure out how to better hold onto leads, and they haven’t really proven they can come from behind on a consistent basis. However, much like players getting stronger and learning to play better post and perimeter defense, it is a process — one I now believe Coach Enfield is more than equipped to steward.

The No. 15 USC men’s volleyball team (0-6, 0-4 MPSF) fell 3-1 (25-27, 25-23, 21-25, 19-25) to No. 1 UCLA (7-0, 4-0 MPSF) Saturday night.
According to head coach Jeff Nygaard, his team showed more than just fight despite the loss.
“When other people see fight, I see capability, I see trust and I see confidence,” Nygaard said.
Senior outside hitter Alex Slaught had a team-high 13 kills while hitting a .233, three blocks and three digs. Sophomore opposite Jon Rivera had 12 kills, two aces and seven digs. Senior libero Brooks Varni and sophomore setter Jack Yoder both tied for a team-high eight digs.
Junior middle blocker Andy Benesh — in his first match of the season — recorded a team-best five blocks and six kills while hitting a .308. Benesh had previously not played because of a back injury.
Benesh’s return brings knowledge and maturity to the team on the court. Benesh spent the summer playing on both the U.S. Men’s Junior National Team and the U.S. Men’s National Team.
“He’s seen the next level,” Nygaard said. “He understands a lot of the game.”
Most noticeably, having Benesh back solidifies the Trojans’ blocking defense. Benesh’s 5 blocks against UCLA was the most recorded by a USC player so far this season.
“Andy’s a great player,” Nygaard said. “Having him back in the lineup will have us get to the next level.”
While the Men of Troy were playing in a somewhat hostile environment at Pauley Pavilion, they managed to hang in with the top team in the nation. The match had a total of 43 tie scores and 14 lead changes.
In the first set, both the Trojans and the Bruins went on short scoring runs to gain advantage over the other, but a UCLA kill and a USC attacking error put the match to the Bruins’ favor in extra time. UCLA came out dominant in the second set, creating a 9-3 lead over the Trojans. The lead stretched to 12-5 before USC began to battle its way back. USC went on an 11-4 scoring run to tie the score at 16-all. The match was tied six more times before a kill by Rivera and a solo block by Benesh sealed the match for the Trojans.
In both the third and fourth sets, the Men of Troy hung close with the Bruins, but toward the end of both sets the Bruins managed to pull away and take the sets and the match.
Even though the Trojans lost, Nygaard was happy to see the “emotional” and “situational maturity” that the team showed against the Bruins.
“It looked to me that the guys thought they could get it back,” Nygaard said. “I’m proud of the maturity they have shown.”
For Nygaard, the maturity is partially stemming from the growth that the team has shown since the start of the season.
“Our guys are doing a really good job of growing on a day to day basis,” Nygaard said.
While the team has been growing, there still are a number of things upon which Nygaard would like the team to improve, one of the things being the team’s thought process when they head back to the service line.
On Saturday, USC had 6 aces while UCLA had 11 aces. Both teams had 18 service errors. Nygaard would like for the team to better “understand the flow of the game” when behind the service line.
This week, the Men of Troy host No. 11 Pepperdine (4-1, 3-1 MPSF) and No. 8 Stanford (5-1, 3-1 MPSF) at the Galen Center.
For the team to notch their first win of the season, Nygaard said that the Trojans will have to be more intelligent on the court.
“I’d like to see greater mindfulness, greater understanding of the game [and] greater decision making,” Nygaard said. “We could just raise the level of volleyball across the board.”
Coach Nygaard is incompetent. His rhetoric is a joke. Win a match first one day. Noticed last four matches the team split first two sets, and then lost the last two each time. Conditioning and strategy missing somewhere. They got Benesh back for ucla with still the same results. Season over unless a miracle turn around happens now.

The No. 8 men’s tennis team opened the 2016 season by hosting the ITA kick-off event at Marks Tennis Stadium, and they came back to defeat Tulane in the championship to earn a spot in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships.
USC fell behind early as Tulane started off quickly in doubles and got the point. Extending their lead, the Green Waves earned three quick wins in singles play, where they had No. 1 player in the nation Dominik Koepfer, as well as their fourth and sixth singles, to clinch the match.
Against UC Davis, USC’s doubles duo junior Nick Crystal and freshman Laurens Verboven paired up to beat Adamson/Levie with the score of 6-1. Senior Max de Vroome and freshman Jack Jaede cruised through Bacharach/Whittle and gave USC the doubles point with a 6-2 win.
In singles, No. 41 Crystal started off, quickly beating No. 38 Alec Adamson 6-1, 6-0. Jaede brought the third point of the day with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Everett Maltby. Shortly after, junior Rob Bellamy defeated Eli Whittle with the same score. In the remaining matches, freshman Jake DeVine scored a double 7-5 to secure a win against Bryce McKelvie, while Verboven took three sets to beat James Wade 6-3, 4-6, 6-1. Freshman Logan Smith was the last one to finish, topping Brett Bacharach 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 giving the Trojans a 7-0 win.
Pepperdine and UC Davis went back on Saturday morning for the consolation match with UCD edging the final point and sealing a third place finish.
Then, USC and Tulane took to the courts for the championship match. The doubles duo of Crystal and Verboven fell to the nationally-ranked team of Chi-San Jao and Koepfer with a final score of 6-1. It didn’t go any better for third doubles, where DeVine and sophomore Tanner Smith were outplayed by Sebastian Rey and Constantin Schmitz 6-2. The Trojans didn’t start well in singles and the first loss of the season seemed to be a concrete possibility.
In the first singles match, de Vroome immediately lost his serve in the first game, and Crystal found himself 0-3 after few minutes. The Trojans lost four of the six first sets, but hope came from courts 4 and 5, where Smith and DeVine secured their first sets with the score of 6-3. DeVine quickly went on to close the set at 6-1 against Nikolas Tukic, bringing the score to a tie.
Tulane took the lead back after Koepfer outplayed de Vroome in a hard fought match that ended with a double 6-3. Smith tied again, finishing 6-3, 6-4 against Rey, taking advantage of an early break in the second set. Crystal, after dropping the first set 0-6, went up 5-2 before being caught again at 5-all. There his experience played a big role and he conquered the second set with the score of 7-5. The third set went on easily, as Crystal took advantage of an early break and closed with the score of 0-6, 7-5, 6-2 to give the Trojans the lead for the first time in the day. Verboven fought hard in the second set but eventually lost 3-6, 5-7 to Alex Van Cott.
All the eyes then shifted to court 6, where Thibault Forget had tied the score at 1-1, winning his second set for 6-3. Both players felt the pressure of the match, but it was Jao from Tulane who went up 4-2 in the third. There, the Frenchman took his game to the next level, and managed to score four consecutive games, ending the match at 3-6, 6-3 and 6-4, giving the Trojans a 4-3 win.
The win is the seventh consecutive title in this event for the Trojans, which earned a ticket for the ITA National Team Indoor Championships that will take place Feb. 12-15 in Charlottesville, Virginia.
The next appointment for the Trojans is the Pac-12/SEC showdown at UCLA, where they will take on Florida Saturday at 10 a.m. and Georgia Sunday at the same time.
Strong showing not. Escaping from the #38 ranked team on your home court leaves a lot to be desired. Next weekend will be a real indication of how good this squad is nationally.

USC and the University Park area have been preparing for a particularly rainy spring.
El Niño, a weather phenomenon that occurs when warm ocean currents appear in the Pacific Ocean, typically leads to above-average rain in Southern California. For months, meteorologists have been predicting that this year’s El Niño season will end up among the largest on record.
Past El Niño events have been especially damaging to the Los Angeles area. In the 1998 season, the rains led to 17 deaths and more than 500 million dollars in damages in the city alone.
With tens of thousands of students attending class every day, living in University-owned housing and the ongoing construction of USC Village, the administration has adopted some strategies to ensure that the campus is prepared for the storms to come.
“Storm water management is incorporated into the design of the campus to limit rainwater run-off,” said Carol Fern, director of organization and methods administration for Facilities Management Services.
According to Fern, the University Park campus has been designed to reduce the rainwater runoff from the campus into the citywide stormwater catching system. The campus design incorporates gravel-filled wells that allow the rain to percolate into the groundwater as well as bioswales that filter the rainwater before it enters the municipal system.
Also among the University’s storm-preparedness process is ensuring that all facets of the campus design are working.
“This process includes cleaning roofs and gutters, drain grates and air-wells and testing systems which pump water from low-lying areas,” Fern said. “These areas are then re-checked when rain is forecasted.”
Under the leadership of the Office of  Fire Safety and Emergency Planning, the University has a special task force assigned with addressing the campus’ El Niño preparedness. The members of this task force include FMS, USC Capital Construction and the Department of Public Safety. All of the University’s building facilities managers are also included in El Niño-related communications.
But one of the most important concerns for the administration is protecting the continuing construction of the USC Village, the University’s current $700 million development.
“All construction projects adhere to the Stormwater Management and Pollution Control requirements,” Fern said. Those regulations require that stormwater not leave a construction site before going through a proper filtration process.
To provide adequate filtration, six French drains — or trenches filled with gravel — have been built on the USC Village site. Each drain at the site is eight feet across and 30 feet deep.
“These drains allow the rainwater to return to the water table instead of sending all of the water into drainage runoff,” said Eddie North-Hager, director of media relations, said.
USC has been in contact with a number of government agencies to ensure that the campus is prepared for the storm.
“Office of Fire Safety & Emergency Planning collaborates with the city of Los Angeles’s Emergency Management Department to plan for all hazards,” Fern said. “The University has a strong working relationship with the city and we are continuously discussing preparedness regarding various types of hazards including El Niño flooding.”
Beyond the campus, many governmental actors have gotten involved to ensure that University Park area residents are safe when El Niño peaks.
As early as November 2015, Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an Executive Directive that tasked a number of city agencies with responsibilities in preparing for El Niño. In particular, the EMD has played a lead role in developing a city-wide storm preparedness strategy that relies largely on education and outreach.
Among EMD’s collaborators on storm preparedness this season are the Red Cross and the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. EMD also implements the Mayor’s directive by working with the Los Angeles county police and fire departments, and public works.
EMD spokeswoman Kathleen Hutton stressed that people in L.A. during El Niño visit ElNinoLA.com and sign up for emergency alerts from NotifyLA.org.
“[ElNinoLA.com]has information on how to prepare yourself, your family, your car and your home for wet winter weather,” Hutton said. “Additionally, we encourage everyone to sign up for emergency alerts from the City of L.A. by visiting NotifyLA.org. There you can register to receive text, voice or email alerts about emergencies from El Niño to our next earthquake.”
At the county level, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas has been working with his colleagues on the Board of Supervisors to prepare for El Niño.
Ridley-Thomas said, “The County’s Office of Emergency Management is working closely with the sheriff’s and fire departments as well as the Departments of Public Works, Public Health and Animal Control to make sure residents and businesses are prepared, and that the various county agencies are responsive to potential rain-related emergencies.”
But Thomas noted that the county’s El Niño priorities this season are not soley on damages but on providing resources to those who need shelter.
“This El Niño season, we are specifically concerned about the safety and well-being of the region’s growing homeless population,” Ridley-Thomas said.
According to Ridley-Thomas, he and his colleagues on the Board of Supervisors have funded an additional 1,600 shelter beds for the homeless in seven locations throughout the county. One of those shelters is in south Los Angeles.
While students should take precautions, they can rest knowing that the USC area is not considered to be in significant danger from El Niño.
“There are no particularly vulnerable sites in the North University Park area of which we are aware,” Ridley-Thomas said.
However, students are urged to serve as additional eyes on campus and report any El Niño-related emergencies to FMS, housing maintenance or DPS.
“The campus is patrolled during rain to identify issues, but it is a large campus,” Fern said.  “So, communicating areas of concern including flooded areas or leaks to FMS or Housing Maintenance will help us get the right personnel out to resolve the issue.”

USC hosted the closing ceremony of the Steve Harvey Mentoring Program for Young Men Sunday morning. The result of a partnership with the United States Army and the Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation, the program hosted 100 boys aged 13-18 from single-parent homes in the Los Angeles area. With the support of their mothers, the U.S. Army, telivision host Steve Harvey and the Harvey Foundation, the boys were recognized for their completion of the program.
One of several programs offered by the Harvey Foundation, the camp was designed to empower young men to become leaders in their communities. For the last three days, the 100 boys have heard messages of discipline and integrity from role models like Brigadier General Sean Gainey and other representatives from the Army, as well as the Omega Phi Psi fraternity which Harvey was a member of at West Virginia University.
Ten of those 100 boys were specifically honored during the ceremony for exemplary leadership skills, and one young man, Cameron Garrison, was even awarded the title of “Future Leader.”
Garrison himself spoke about the impact of the program.
“I was able to associate with other men of color on how to become a man and a man of my word,” Garrison said.
The ceremony — which included an address made by Harvey to the boys and their mothers, musical and spoken word performances by USC undergraduate Celeste Butler and her brother Prestige, and USC graduate student Jay Dent respectively — saw Harvey mixing advice to the audience with jokes, even addressing his recent Miss Universe mishap.
“You’re looking at a man who has been homeless and lived in a car for three years. You’re looking at the man who said the wrong name at the Miss Universe Pageant. How did this dude get here?” Harvey said.
Despite Harvey’s anecdotes, the focus of the ceremony never strayed from the young men in the crowd. He urged them to look at the USC student body as examples of something to strive for.
“You’re on a college campus. You’re at USC. You’re surrounded by people trying to do better for themselves and make something of their life,” Harvey said.
Most importantly, he urged the boys to respect their mothers and work hard to prepare themselves for success.
“The respect you have for your mother is directly tied to your successes,” Harvey said. “It’s better to be prepared, then not have an opportunity than to have an opportunity and not be prepared.”
Command Sergeant Major of Army Recruiting Command Willie Clemmons echoed Harvey afterwards saying,
“If you want to be successful, you have to invest in yourself and no one can take your education away from you,” Clemmons said.
Starting with a campus tour Friday evening, the importance of education was a common theme throughout the program, as well as the value of mentorship, which USC Rossier Professor Darnell Cole highlighted in his keynote address that closed the event.
“Every successful person never achieved that success alone,” Cole said.

Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor accused of leaking classified government documents, and Barton Gellman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist spoke during an interview that was broadcast live Saturday morning by the Gould School of Law. The interview was conducted in partnership with UC Irvine for a two-day symposium, “What Cannot Be Said, Freedom of Expression in a Changing World.”
The two-day event was timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris and features an in-depth examination of freedom of expression through various activities, including stand-up comedy and musical artistry.
Snowden began the interview by describing his military upbringing and his lost faith in the government.
“I grew up in the shadow of government. I was not radical. I was not skeptical. I signed up to join the army after we declared war in Iraq because I believed the government’s assertion that we were going to free the press. It was a just cause,” Snowden said. “My father worked in the military for 30 years. My grandfather was an admiral. My mother worked in the court systems.”
Snowden described his experience working for the NSA as unnerving. As he gained greater access within NSA ranks, he said that these national security programs were not what they claimed to be.
“In many cases, the primary uses of the tools that had been publicly justified as anti-terrorism tools were actually being used for something completely different,” Snowden said.
These programs were largely being used for foreign intelligence.  Gellman brought the focus to college students and whether students and members of the younger generations should be concerned about government surveillance.
“Suppose they’re thinking, ‘Are there places I shouldn’t browse? Are there people I shouldn’t allow to friend me? Or jokes I shouldn’t tell? Or places I shouldn’t visit?’” Gellman said. “Would you advise them to be concerned about that?”
Snowden answered by explaining what information the federal government is storing.
“What the government describes as ‘bulk collection’ and everyone else on the planet describes as ‘mass surveillance’ means that every communication that can be intercepted and stored is being intercepted and stored,” Snowden said.
Both Snowden and Gellman went on to explain the concept of metadata to their student audience. Metadata was described as “the records of records” and how agencies can track your actions as opposed to digging through the content of your communications.
“Metadata, in the simplest context, means activity records. It means what you do and where you do it,” Snowden said. “It’s like a private eye; you’d notice if they were following you around. They can’t sit right behind you every time you go to a cafe, because you’ll probably notice this creepy guy.”
Gellman said that it is easier than ever to access data from handheld devices.
“Now the creepy guy is your iPhone or Android phone sitting in your pocket,” Gellman said.
Snowden presented a 2014 New York Review headline, “We Kill People Based On Metadata,” a direct quote from Gen. Michael Hayden, the former NSA director.
Gellman then segued into a conversation about the social media platform Snapchat.
“Everyone who’s using Snapchat for ‘interesting’ photos: It’s being deleted from that individual’s phone, but it’s still going through surveillance,” Snowden said. “You send a message to Snapchat, and they send it to someone else. They keep copies of these messages.”
Snowden drew applause from both USC and UC Irvine students when explaining the process of whistleblowing.
“There’s a step when you see too much, and you’re driven to action,” Snowden said. “We all have a moral imperative to find that point.”
Following the remarks from Gellman and Snowden, the interview was opened to the audience to ask questions for Snowden.
When asked about his lasting impression on the U.S. public, Snowden denied overt praise from those who may idolize him.
“I don’t like the word ‘hero’. I’m not a hero or a traitor, I’m just a citizen,” Snowden said.
Snowden – a hero of the highest order.
Please make this video interview available online, perhaps on YouTube.

The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization responsible for honoring the year’s greatest musical achievements with the Grammy Awards, released its nominations for 2016 in December 2015. This year’s nominees across all categories were particularly strong, and the race for the most revered award, Album of the Year, contains one of the best groups of candidates in recent memory. The Album of the Year for this selection is especially eclectic, as two nominees — hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar (nominated for To Pimp a Butterfly) and pop artist Taylor Swift (nominated for 1989) — were both nominated for the same award in 2014. Swift won the award in 2010. On the other hand, a debut album was nominated, that being Traveller by country singer Chris Stapleton, who is best known for his repertoire of country hits he contributed to as a songwriter. Alabama Shakes, the band nominated for Best New Artist in 2013, returns to the awards show for its lauded release of Sound and Color, a blues rock/soul album. The Weeknd receives his first individual Grammy nomination for Beauty Behind the Madness, along with recognition in six other categories. His performances of “The Hills,” which spent six consecutive weeks as Billboard’s No. 1 Song, and “Can’t Feel My Face” were among the most commercially and critically successful singles of the year.
Each of this year’s nominees pose great competition, but upon looking more in-depth at each album and the history of the Academy’s trends in choosing winners, one may be able to narrow the list to fewer likely winners and key decisive traits of each album. One of the clearest is that the Grammy for Best Album has not been awarded to a southern rock or traditional country album since 1969, although there was a nod to Swift’s country/pop Fearless that won Best Album in 2010. It has also not been given to a debut album since Norah Jones’s Come Away with Me in 2003, which puts the odds for Stapleton’s release as an upset.
In the case of Taylor Swift’s album, the first half blew away critics and fans alike, as “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space” claimed high marks on the charts. However, the second half of the album was critiqued by some for not being as enticing. While still likely to win in several other categories, Swift’s main producer Max Martin, whose fingerprints are across all credits on the album, failed to win with “Shake It Off” in the 2015 nominations, which is a bad omen for the album this year.
One may consider the sleeper picks to be the albums of Alabama Shakes and The Weeknd. Sound and Color is just the second release from the Alabama-based band. The album is also nominated for Best Alternative Music Album, but may be less likely to win in that category because of its blues/soul characteristics in a category that has been awarded to predominantly alt-rock albums. However, 2010’s The Suburbs by Arcade Fire — another album nominated in the same categories by a lower-profile band at the time — won Best Album, so one should keep an eye on Brittany Howard’s band. Beauty Behind the Madness poses the second strongest case to win, considering the acclaim and performance of The Weeknd throughout 2015. It will be interesting to see how the Academy receives the Canadian singer, who was largely ignored for his immensely successful mixtapes later compiled into a release as Trilogy and 2013’s Kiss Land, his first label debut that failed to receive a nomination. Beauty Behind the Madness is riveting throughout, with his song “Earned It” even receiving a nomination for an Oscar for Best Original Song,  and The Weeknd’s rise to stardom may earn him this revered honor.
Among the candidates, the most important to watch will be rapper Kendrick Lamar’s funk- and jazz-infused To Pimp a Butterfly. Lamar’s release is already being considered by many as a rap masterpiece, from reports of college courses analyzing the album to nearly perfect reviews from critics to Rolling Stone calling it “one-of-a-kind.” What sets To Pimp apart from the rest, and the songs that Lamar received several nominations for, may be its consciousness of social justice never before so directly and appealingly tackled. Lamar rhymes about the trials and tribulations related to racism, sexism, social class, financial inequality, mental health, incarceration and police brutality that affect communities across America. In an era where rap has been dominated by the idols of wealth, materialism and boasting on those topics; Lamar’s album effuses the soul-searching and realization of many injustices that plague our nation, and the  consequences of popular rap’s image. Yet, popular music tends to turn away from those realities, despite Lamar’s image of reality being far more common than the glamour and opulence of the stars of hip hop. To Pimp a Butterfly, as evocative and grooving as it is musically, is also a call to audiences and listeners of all backgrounds to evaluate their values. An album such as this, especially at a time when the election is near and injustices against minority communities run rampant, is invaluable. The Grammys will be an important platform to recognize this talented and salient performance. However, history could repeat itself, as Lamar’s 2014’s album failed to win, and Macklemore’s The Heist won Best Rap Album in an upset win that same year. Many viewers criticized the Grammy award win as a matter of race and commercialism, as Macklemore himself believed Lamar deserved the award. Undoubtedly, this will be a close Best Album race that music fans will discuss for a long time. The 58th Grammy Awards airs on CBS Feb. 15 at 8 p.m.

In an age where the internet finds deep pride in being a hotbed for political and sociological outrage, the collective Twitter and Facebook communities did not fail to disappoint this week when they voiced their complaints over the so called #OscarsSoWhite diversity catastrophe that plagued both this and last year’s homogenous Academy Award nominations. Despite a fairly diverse array of movies released in 2015, including F. Gary Gray’s Straight Outta Compton, fellow USC alum Rick Famuyiwa’s Dope, Peter Landesman’s Concussion and Ryan Coogler’s Creed, not a single person of color was nominated for an acting role, either male or female, and Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu was the only non-white filmmaker to be nominated for Best Director (for the second year in a row).
In a rapid-fire response to the backlash, the Academy has announced several initiatives to implement in the next few years, including “an ambitious, global campaign to identify and recruit qualified new members who represent greater diversity.” Clearly, the #OscarsSoWhite campaign made some positive influence on a systemically-flawed industry, but the problem doesn’t end there. Along with identifying new talent, they’ve also proposed to prevent Academy members from awards-season voting if they haven’t been active in the last ten years, a change that some members feel is misguided. Retired director and Academy voter Sam Weisman states it’s “a hastily put-together reaction to a firestorm” that ultimately ignores deeper issues.
The attempt to put restrictions on older voters stems from the idea that most Academy voters are primarily white men who — stuck in the infamous Hollywood studio system of the past — only hire other white men. In 2012, Los Angeles Times reported that 94 percent of Academy voters were white and of that group, 77 percent were male. Presumably, these are the same white men occupying positions of power as — to borrow a phrase from long-time Academy voter Tab Hunter — the “backbone of Hollywood,” the same men that choose whether to, say, hire (or more appropriately, not hire) a black director or latino actress for a lead role. But, as some members have pointed out, they aren’t entirely to blame. By restricting these member’s voting rights, they are only superficially attempting to abate the maelstrom, rather than examining a deeper issue at large — one that extends beyond a single hashtag and the number of older members allowed to vote.
The problem does not have to do with who wins what award — an award that is in no way indicative of ticket sales, and subsequently audience reach. The true problem lies in who is cast or hired in the first place. Newly-awarded Emmy winner Viola Davis has said as much this past week when discussing the Oscars. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight she asks pointedly, “You can change the academy, but if there are no black films being produced, what is there to vote for?” Of course, the problem becomes ever increasingly muddied when its clear that producers and studios often hire filmmakers and actors based on awards and accolades, but not all decisions are made around these factors.
There’s only so much an organization can do if the players within and around it aren’t willing to change — but to target members purely based on their age and lack of recent activity perpetuates a stereotype of another kind, one that seems to claim that just because a member may be old and white and male probably means that they’re racist and stuck in the past. That isn’t to say that I claim allegiance with Academy Award nominee Charlotte Rampling — who earlier this week claimed that the outrage was “racist to white people.” Rather, I feel that the part of the Academy’s response to the fervor was only an attempt to dissuade rather than change. If we are truly to reach an age of equality and understanding, however, satisfying one side of the line by blindly restricting the other encourages widespread hostility and resentment, instead of allowing both sides a chance to speak.
Clearly, the awards are an important venue to discuss this change — as this year’s host Chris Rock will address in the opening monologue when the show airs in February — but the Oscars outrage shouldn’t be viewed as the end all, be all in terms of successful change, because despite stoking the fire of an ongoing dialogue, it has also raised further problems among voters, possibly spurring even deeper rooted prejudice on the other side. In actuality, the issue at hand is much larger and grander in scope than who or what a bunch of industry elite vote for at the end of the year — and the public should take this into account when sharing or retweeting.

Nestled on a busy corner in the heart of Atwater Village, the recently opened Ozu East Kitchen takes the place of former restaurant Atwater Village Farm. After several months of remodeling, Ozu opened its doors to the Atwater community in December, boasting a reimagined combination of Japanese and Korean foods with an emphasis on ramen.
Owner and Atwater Village local Paul Yi wants to bring a variety of Asian flavors into his restaurant, and he delivers. Walking into the restaurant, a glossy, minimalistic interior provides a sleek and modern aesthetic to the dining experience. The restaurant offers both table and counter service; upon entering the restaurant, customers are welcomed by friendly cashiers who take their order before receiving a number and finding a seat at one of the few tables inside.
From there, guests are helped by a welcoming staff of waiters and waitresses who check in on them periodically. Yi is the hands-on type, as he makes his rounds, serves dishes and speaks with customers night after night. This shows strong commitment toward making his restaurant a success. The community seems to be on board; the cozy restaurant is packed tight with both locals and out-of-towners.
The upscale design of Ozu East Kitchen’s interior design intelligently pairs with its diverse menu, which offers a select choice of snacks, small plates and bowls, as well as vegan and gluten-free options. The contemporary atmosphere of the restaurant drives each guest’s focus toward the food and table conversation.
The pork roll presents juicy, braised pork shoulder with crunchy pea shoots and jalapeño miso. This eclectic blend of textures — soft and savory, crispy and thick — is all wrapped up in a fluffy, wholesome scallion pancake. The crispy rice cake is a collection of small, spicy rice balls displayed in a bowl with chili vinaigrette, sunny side-up egg and herbs. Yi advises this bowl be mixed together before consuming to get the perfect blend of flavors and consistency in every bite. In terms of main courses, everything in the pork ramen is cooked to perfection. The dish combines tender Kurobuta pork belly, well-done ajitama egg, tangy pickles and piquant and peppery mizuna with noodles in a thin, light broth.
The only unfavorable element about this restaurant for students is its location. Atwater Village (near Glendale) can be hard to get to without a car on campus. However, at $5 to $6 for snacks, $8 to $10 for small plates and $10 to $13 for bowls, this restaurant is well worth a try.

Popular U.K. metal band Bullet for My Valentine is back and bites harder than ever with their newest album, Venom, in addition to a year-long headlining tour titled The British Invasion.
Following much success in 2013, with Temper Temper debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hard Music Albums Chart and top 15 on the Billboard Top 200, BFMV aims to leave a mark on the genre while maintaining previous success with their fifth full-length record.
After saying goodbye to bassist Jason “Jay” James and welcoming Jamie Matthias on bass and backing vocals, the band decided to go a different direction in recording. Though BFMV previously wrote and recorded in compressed time periods, the band members wrote Venom in six months in guitarist, Michael — also known as “Padge” — Paget’s home.
In addition, BFMV invited Colin Richardson and Carl Bown, the men who produced their earlier albums like The Poison in 2005 and Scream Aim Fire in 2008, to produce Venom, adding a sense of familiarity to the record.
Venom is packed with energetic, menacing and heavy ballads, including the title track, a piece with each elaborate scream acting as emotional catharsis to the harsh realities of life. Other songs such as “You Want a Battle? (Here’s a War)” feature ostentatious rhythms, passionate screams and a powerful guitar presence from guitarists Matt Tuck and Paget.
Bullet for My Valentine will be performing a show with Asking Alexandria and While She Sleeps at The Wiltern  Feb. 6 at 6:30 p.m.
The Daily Trojan had an opportunity to interview Paget about Venom and the album’s inspiration over the phone.
Daily Trojan: Your band’s new album Venom has been described as similar in style and sound to your older albums, for example The Poison. Would you agree that your sound has gone back to your roots, or would you consider this statement invalid?
Michael Paget: Yes, well, we definitely wanted to write a record truer to our roots this time. We didn’t intend so much to draw influence from The Poison, but just to write a metal record.
 
DT: “Army of Noise” is the song that is the most different than the others in the album. What was the inspiration for writing this song, and what do you think makes it so unique?
 
MP: We wrote the music for “Army of Noise” on tour but rewrote it during the Venom sessions. We love a bit of old school thrash and figured why not go for it. It’s a great song to play live.
 
DT: You obviously have been and continue to be a very successful band. What are your goals and hopes for the future of it?
 
MP: We just want to continue writing music and have fun doing it. We are so honored to have this career, and blown away that it’s now been 11 years and counting. It’s still very exciting for us.
DT: What do you think was the biggest obstacle you faced as a musician and member of a band?
 
MP: Being the best that you can be is demanding. I also think that temptation is very difficult for any member of a rock/metal band. On the road, it’s sometimes very hard to stay focused.
 
DT: What would you say to people who have not been exposed to this genre of music and are actually sort of afraid of it to be able to appreciate metal the way that you do?
 
MP: Our genre is definitely a good way to get rid of demons and free yourself from the banes of life. It works for me. But I do love all kinds of music too. I will try anything really.
DT: Describe Venom in three words.
 
MP: Our best record.

The past year proved to be a tumultuous year for women’s reproductive rights. From congressional debates to Planned Parenthood attacks, nothing was off the table. But early 2016 has already promised new changes, as Oregon and, more recently, California have ceded authority back to women by making birth control pills available over the counter. In the United States, this unprecedented move to forgo the prescription process is an important step for those who do not have access to doctors but have a need for contraception. While the debate for women’s reproductive rights continues, it is imperative that states are taking matters into their own hands.
The current system in the United States allows females to use oral contraceptives only with a prescription. However, this practice rests on two false assumptions: that women see doctors regularly and that they have health insurance. Proper medical attention is a luxury, not a right, and impoverished neighborhoods are often left unprepared. Women in these areas, as a result, often do not have health insurance. The Census Bureau claims that approximately 10.4 percent of the population was uninsured the 2014 calendar year, whereas impoverished populations were 19.3 percent uninsured. For the women in these communities, getting prescriptions is not an easy task; they must go to a doctor, who they may not see regularly, and ask for a prescription, which they then must spend money on. Over-the-counter pills increase accessibility and thus increase opportunities for women to protect themselves and their bodies.
A key motivator in this law is the influence that the pills would have on the health care sector. Intuitively, it makes sense that access to contraceptives would drive down the number of unintended pregnancies, reducing the number of abortions. But what isn’t nearly as intuitive is just how effective the practice is. In a study conducted at Washington University of St. Louis, 9,000 women who normally lack access to such contraceptives were given the opportunity to use any contraceptives of their choice — for free. After some time, the patients were observed, and researchers found that there were only 4.4 to 7.5 abortions per 1,000 live births, as compared to 13.4 to 17 abortions in the area. This decrease bodes well for the U.S. healthcare system. As contraceptives reduce the number of abortions, they also alleviate the significant burden of abortions on the healthcare system, which currently cost the country $11 billion in taxpayer money per year.
Currently, much of the money allotted toward this cause is being spent on reactive measures that do little to stop unwanted pregnancies from occurring repeatedly. Instead, the money that is saved from reduced abortion rates should be spent on other preventative measures. One major critique of this statewide plan is that over-the-counter pills could prove to be costly since the Affordable Care Act does not require coverage of over-the-counter medicine. Yet there is an easy solution for this problem that requires some faith in the system: money that is saved from unwanted abortions could help fund contraceptives in the future, essentially subsidizing the costs. And since the Affordable Care Act’s health coverage cannot often provide relief to fund contraceptives, the possible subsidy would help people also covered by the ACA. While the policy is only hitting state legislature, this first step could begin a movement that extends through the nation, eventually hitting Washington, D.C., much like marriage equality did in 2015.
The United States, surprisingly, is one of the last 45 countries in the world to still require a doctor’s approval to use birth control, and with around half of the annual pregnancies being unintended, it is high time that we usher in the rights that all women deserve. So while these laws may only be taking action in California and Oregon, the attention the states will gain for the issue will only help the case for reproductive rights.

This past Saturday at the Los Angeles Convention Center thousands of techies, college students and execs peered into the future together. At Virtual Reality Los Angeles, billed as the world’s largest independent VR conference, producers, directors and creatives showed off their latest 360-degree work. Nokia pulled out its new camera, filmmakers screened their refined work and startups sold Google cardboard-like gadgets for consumers to take it all in.
Panels were held to discuss both ethical and technological issues arising in the field. Attendees were given immersive demos where they wore their headsets and spun around in whatever world they were being placed. The day was full of excitement as well as uneasiness.
It was ground zero for millennials. Not only for the irresistible new gadgets, but also because virtual reality has many of the same characteristics as a millennial.
Virtual reality, the burgeoning immersive medium that has taken leaps and bounds in the past couple of years, feels like it’s finally on the cusp of, well, reality. We have a consumer headset on the market. VRLA draws in more and more people each cycle. VR is here. It’s real. Yet we still don’t know exactly where it’s going. How will it work? Where will it go?
The same can be said about us millennials.
One of the largest groups prancing around VRLA exhibits on Saturday was college students. More specifically, they were USC film and journalism students.
This was not a coincidence.
Just like VR, we are beginning to emerge. We’re a recurring conversation within think tanks and the Silicon Valley. Our next moves could mean something bigger for the economy, society and maybe the world. Or at least that’s how it feels. That’s what we’ve been hearing in recent years, as we become the largest demographic in the U.S.
We have to accept this uncertainty. For thousands of us at USC, it is our last semester. There is the uncertainty of where we will work, what city we will land in and who we will be surrounded by. For all intents and purposes, we won’t have full control for the beginning parts of our post-grad lives. There are outside factors to consider: the job market and student loans to name a few.
During one of the day’s panels, Bryn Mooster, co-founder of the news media company RYOT, offered some advice on virtual reality that can be applied to millennials’ thought processes as well.
“This is a moment when we have transformational, powerful and immersive tools to start telling stories,” Mooster said. “So I think that, again, it’s up to us to tell stories and certainly our hope is that we use this technology to try to connect the world in a way.”
Mooster said he recognized that virtual reality can be used for anything. The extra dimension added to entertainment calls for reflection on how we shape new narratives when given this power.
Right now, college students are doing the same by putting those dots together and creating their reality.
We won’t always have control over the whole system, but we have control over what we create.
We are experiencing rapid change just like the virtual reality realm, where we have the power to form narratives. We are adding another dimension to our lives — post-grad life. It’s up to us to create positive situations for ourselves.
That means meeting those internship deadlines. Prepping for those job interviews. Keeping our head afloat during the rigorous academic semester. Realizing that the breakups, roommate quarrels and lack of gas money to fill up your car are not end-of-the-world situations.
VRLA over the weekend exemplified what I have been writing about for the past semester and what I aim to accomplish in this coming one. I will analyze the unique pressures on millennials in the hopes of trying to alleviate our always-there anxiety.
And I’ll keep sharing narratives on the lives of young 20-somethings.
In the meantime, you keep creating and connecting. Let me know about what you think I should write. Like virtual reality, this column is a community effort.
So whether you’re a senior looking at job posting everyday, or a sophomore feeling the pressure of maintaining that GPA or even a junior immersing yourself in a country abroad, just know that life will all shape up soon.
The start of this semester is going to be the beginning of something new. Not really sure what it is, but it’ll be great.
After reading “Wait An L.A. Minute” on Mondays, join Jordyn Holman in her millennial conversations on Twitter @JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.

Rachel Atherly | DailyTrojan
The stress of USC’s academic rigor, the strains of fitting in without the comforting presence of old friends and the stark abandonment of the platitudes of a familiar high school life is something almost every Trojan can relate to. Unfortunately, this environment proves to be a breeding ground for the unyielding grips of debilitating anxiety and depression. The student in every four who experiences much more than gastric butterflies before a chemistry midterm must deal with a sickness that many prefer not to talk about. Though mental illness is the elephant in the room when it comes to today’s largest health challenges, it seems to be locked out of the room, waiting in line to get in. At USC, rather than seeking to address these challenges with band-aid solutions, we should create more rapid and efficient treatments for those with mental health issues by circumventing the Engemann Student Health Center altogether.
Some may argue that efforts targeted at eliminating the collegiate stigma, pioneered by many student organizations on campus, coupled with a marginal increase in counselors at the health center, is sufficient to strengthen mental health at USC. For example, organizations such as Free Minds, National Alliance on Mental Illness and Undergraduate Student Government work tirelessly to build a more accepting and tolerant campus for the mentally ill. This change only unlocks the door, however, allowing mental health to be part of the discussion. It still must wait behind other illnesses — labeled as more pressing — by the health center. Although the multitude of awareness programs have been a powerful tool, these initiatives only are effective in decreasing stigma and ignorance, rather than the source of the problem itself: the treatment of these disorders. Awareness alone will not help the forsaken student cooped up in Leavey, shivering from debilitating anxiety.
Unfortunately, the student previously illustrated is often deferred, and must wait behind many others due to the practice of triage at the health center, prioritizing some students with more pressing issues over others. According to Kelly Greco, a staff psychologist at the health center, the counselors at Engemann must first prioritize high-risk patients, whose lives may be at risk, before helping students deemed as low-risk, based on a 20-minute evaluation over the phone. The unfortunate side effect of this practice is that attending to a small demographic of students neglects the majority dealing with issues such as academic or social stresses, and prioritizes students with more grave complications. Of course, this practice is reasonable given the scarcity of counselors. Nevertheless, attending to those few students neglects the many who have made the undeniably brave leap of asking for help. By doing so, what starts as a simply academic or social problem could burgeon into a full-blown diagnosable illness, simply because a student did not have someone to talk to.
The health center’s administrative strategy of hiring more counselors will likely only lead to a marginal improvement in treatment. When I called the heath center, despite my previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder, I was put on a waiting list of two months in order to see a counselor, even after the new hires. Therefore, simply hiring more counselors will not eliminate this destructive waitlist. Hiring a sufficient amount of counselors would likely prove to be too costly for this large University. Rather, a more cost-effective alternative would be to create a complement to traditional counseling practices through peer-led, one-one-one counseling services.
Critics may say that placing such serious health concerns in the hands of undergraduate students could prove to be a liability for the University or even lead to improper identification or treatment of a serious condition. However, a student-led organization would not be liable to the same practice regulations that the accredited health center is subjected to. This lack of liability ensures that the University will not be fined for any malpractice committed by the organization and can benefit from the money the institution saves from this free counseling service. Moreover, this type of organization would not be a direct branch of the health center but an alternative advertised by professional counselors whom are equally distressed with the long list of people in need. In addition, the students would be trained directly by health center staff and would exclusively deal with the neglected population who are left to wait due to their designation as low-risk individuals. This form of peer counseling would serve as a buffer, providing students with a peer to serve as a sensitive listening ear, potentially preventing further harm.
One student initiative is pursuing this very strategy. Peer Counseling is the best bet for USC’s growing epidemic of long waiting lists and unaddressed mental health issues. This organization targets the neglected demographic that must wait months just for someone to listen to their distressed thoughts. Moreover, talking to a fellow peer, rather than a professional who may appear intimidating, may encourage the reluctant student who may not call the health center to seek help in the first place.
Even though USC has made strides to improve universal acceptance of mental disorders, there is still much room to grow and adapt to the increasing demand for counseling. An administrative approach — characterized by augmenting the number of counselors — has marginally improved a big and complex problem. Granted, putting this issue in the hands of the students may not resolve the ultimate issue of attending to each student in need. However, creating a safe environment for students to have a private conversation with a peer is a necessary step to creating a healthier Trojan Family.
