Students and professors at Bovard Auditorium were treated to an evening with Natasha Trethewey Tuesday, where the poet performed a book reading from her newest memoir, “Memorial Drive: A Daughter’s Memoir,” and answered questions on meanings of family, race and history.
Trethewey is a Pulitzer Prize winner for her book “Native Guard,” a two-time poet laureate of the United States and the holder of a plethora of awards and fellowships, such as the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt Prize in Poetry for Lifetime Achievement. She currently serves as a Board of Trustees professor of English at Northwestern University.
Within her reading of “Memorial Drive,” Trethewey performed a deep dive into her memories, revisiting the crime scene where her mother was murdered nearly 30 years prior and expressing her enduring relationship with her.
Reading an excerpt from her prologue, Trethewey said, “Vowing never to return, I took with me what I had cultivated all those years: mute avoidance of my past, silence and willed amnesia buried deep in me like a root. Nor could I have anticipated then that anything would ever draw me back to that city … a reminder of a past I was determined to forget even as I tried to honor her memory in every way I knew how.”
The book is about surviving traumas, both personal and national, as an African American woman. It’s about grief and the bond between mother and child, and about discovering the importance of place and forging herself into a writer. 
Trethewey also responded to audience questions in an event, marking the continuation of a series of speakers that have come to USC as part of The Subir and Malini Chowdhury Foundation Distinguished Speaker Series. The series is held by Visions and Voices, an initiative in the arts and humanities at USC that launched in 2006. 
David Delgado, the production specialist for Visions and Voices, is vocal about the importance of holding events in the arts and humanities for students at USC.
“The arts are absolutely pivotal to our students’ education, not just here at USC, but at any institution of learning,” Delgado said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It goes hand in hand [with] what individuals are learning from textbooks, but to actually experience art in a live and communal form, we believe is pivotal to the growth of our community.” 
Recent empirical evidence suggests that arts participation is related to behaviors that contribute to the health of civic society. Delgado emphasized the benefits of providing an education on culture, saying that, “we want our Trojan students to be as well rounded as possible, not just learning science and math and engineering, but also the arts and humanities, which fill the soul as well as the mind.”
The event series is designed to bring internationally renowned authors to campus. Along with Trethewey this year, the University has also hosted distinguished authors Michael Ondaatje and Zadie Smith. 
Alex Flores, a freshman majoring in public relations and an audience member, is a big fan of Trethewey’s work. They spoke of how much it meant to them to be able to see her speak and read from her work in person. 
“I loved everything that she wrote about, even though we come from two very different worlds. We’re two completely different people, but I kind of felt like we were one,” Flores said. “[The reading and] interview [were] everything I could have hoped for.”
Trethewey answered questions about her childhood being raised by a Black mother and white father in segregated Mississippi. She recounted how her family was targeted by hate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and how the public admonished the relationship between her parents. 
Trethewey said recalling her past provides clarity for current affairs, saying that “even though I’m talking about half a century ago, so much of [these events] has an increasing resonance right now.”
As the Supreme Court is reportedly leaning toward ending affirmative action in the near future, the removal of Confederate statues perennially remains on the agenda of discourse in many Southern states. Last week, the Georgia Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit objecting to the removal of Confederate statues from downtown Covington to move forward.
“I think about contests over Confederate memorials,” Trethewey said. “Things that people think have been expelled long ago. Issues around civil rights; the way that, even in the language which is used against same-sex marriage, was the same language deployed against interracial marriage.”
Tripp Carrington, a freshman majoring in narrative studies and audience member, decided to attend the event after reading one of Trethewey’s works in his American Literature class. Carrington said he found the reading to be a valuable experience.
“I thought that the reading was beautiful, especially to hear writing from the author’s own voice is always valuable,” Carrington said. “She was gracious enough to stay back, answer questions. I found it really interesting and beneficial for anybody interested in literature.”

At Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting, the Senate unanimously passed SB 142-31, which will cancel all USG events on election day. The Senate body believes that canceling USG events will increase voter turnout among the student government body, allowing USG-affiliated students to have more time off to vote.
Next week’s Senate meeting, and all USG events next Tuesday, will be canceled — unless the event is related to the elections — and no officer shall be required to serve office hours on election day. 
Canceling USG events will allow more students to not only vote, but participate in activities such as volunteering at the polls or driving the elderly to polling places. 
This isn’t the first time USG has tried to increase student engagement in politics. In March 2021, last year’s Senate unanimously approved a resolution to make election day a non-instructional day at USC, citing that the mandatory attendance requirements were “barriers that restrict civic participation.”
The bill posits that promoting student participation in civic duties is important, since voting from a young age increases the likelihood of a person voting for the rest of their life. 
Senator Divya Jakatdar presented project updates including developments to LiveSafe, an app that provides features and resources to report issues to Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services and the Department of Public Safety. Other projects include scouting locations with Student Health for medical supply vending machines on campus, creating an undocumented student center to investigate ways to increase student basic needs and working with housing to provide resources and supplies for Trojan Shelter operations. 
“We’ve had quite a few conversations about the [undocumented student center],” Jakatdar said. “Location is the big thing … possible spaces could be in one of the libraries or the Physical Education building. Those are some of the spaces around campus that we find are underutilized.” 
Chair of external affairs Monica Rodriguez shared project highlights including the Mental Health Assistance & Response 
Team, creating a community mural, working with Sole2Soul to repurpose athletic shoes to distribute to the community, working with the Los Angeles neighborhood council, DPS reform projects and expansions to the Fryft program.
“My committee focuses on the relationship with USC and the surrounding community,” Rodriguez said. “The relationship has been a bit hostile, and as someone from South L.A., it’s really clear to me that I need to fix this relationship and try to develop healthy habits between students and the surrounding communities to begin to mend that relationship.”
The Senate also swore in senator Cameron Cornelio at the meeting, replacing former senator Jessica Gonzalez who resigned on Monday. Cornelio was the next highest-ranked candidate not currently serving and willing to fill the position.
Cornelio campaigned with Andrew Taw, focusing their platform on transparency within the Greek life system, student body connection, sustainability, the transfer student community and cross-communication with each student identity assembly in Spring 2022. 
“Coming in this late into the term gives me the opportunity to help where I can,” Cornelio said. “I understand that I’m serving on the Wellness committee. I’m helping any senators with what they need right now and bringing in some of those campaign points that I actually ran on to bring in my own perspectives.”  
Chief of programming officer Jillian Fallon announced Matthew Calma, a junior majoring in public relations and political economy, as the nominee for the assistant director of the Political Student Assembly. The Senate unanimously confirmed the nomination.

I’m writing this on my rooftop mere minutes before my 21st birthday. I’m listening to my favorite songs, looking out onto the Los Angeles skyline and reflecting on everything that’s happened this past year as I soak up the last moments of my 21st trip around the sun. I’m not out on the town like I always thought I’d be, counting down the seconds until midnight when I can proudly show a bartender my ID. All of that sounds fun, but I really wouldn’t want to be having a wild night out right now. 
Maybe this longing for introspection is just part of getting older — or maybe it’s the eclipse season. 
Come 2:59 a.m. PST on Nov. 8, a lunar eclipse in Taurus will push us toward change and personal growth. 
In astrology, the moon represents your innermost emotions. It’s who you are, at your core, when no one else is around. On their own, full moons heighten emotions and encourage introspection. About two times per year, though, the full moon takes place in a lunar eclipse, which intensifies emotions even more drastically. 
This is the second eclipse season of the year, with the first happening in April and May. The broader season started in November of last year and will end next October. The stars may be pushing you to work through certain challenges that arose around this time last year. 
The Oct. 25 solar eclipse in Scorpio kicked off this month’s cycle, bringing identity crises and an urge to distance ourselves from others. Now, we’re in the transitional period between the two eclipses, a time for high amounts of reflection and growth. 
People with fixed placements — Scorpio, Taurus, Leo and Aquarius — will feel the effects of the eclipse season more than others. 
Taurus is a fixed earth sign, meaning it exhibits the stabilizing, stubborn nature of a fixed sign with the grounded, practical energy of the earth element. So, although there may be intense emotions on the horizon, Taurus energy will encourage us to deal with them in a relatively calm manner. Still, the placement could lead to internalizing feelings, so don’t be afraid to tell others what’s really on your mind.
Here’s what to focus on this week based on your rising sign.
Aries
The eclipse will occur in your twelfth house of the subconscious. Trust your gut and take some time out of your busy schedule to listen with what your body, heart and mind tell you. Failure to do so may lead to an outburst of emotion when you least expect it. It may also be wise to take some time before making any important decisions and to avoid making these decisions based solely on emotion. 
Taurus
Self care should be your priority right now, Taurus. In spite of the never-ending midterm season, take even an hour out of your day to focus on you. Sorting through your emotions, however that looks for you, is a good idea. Journal, talk to a friend or pour your energy into something creative this week. 
Gemini
With the moon in your second house of possessions, now is a good time to go through any sentimental objects you own. Are you holding on to anything that you should let go of to move forward? Clean up your spaces in general too this week — especially the places you don’t often give your attention to. Dig that trash out of your backpack, look under your bed and head out of eclipse season with a fresh start. 
Cancer
Healthy communication is key for you this week. Don’t keep your emotions bottled up. Pour your energy into how you communicate best, whether it’s over coffee with a friend, creating art or a phone call to a family member. Try to be vulnerable and you’ll see progress in the areas of your life that are causing difficulties right now. 
Leo
The eclipse will occur in your fourth house of family and home. Take some time to send a letter to your family, buy some flowers for your apartment or make dinner with your roommates. Making yourself comfortable and encouraging stability in your environment is key this week, especially as a fixed sign who will be feeling the effects of the eclipse more than others. 
Virgo
The moon is in your fifth house of pleasure, which is in charge of not only love, but all of the little things in life that bring happiness. Get in tune with your love language and do something special for yourself this week. If your love language is gifts, take a few minutes to order something you’ve been wanting. If it’s acts of service, get a chore done that will make your future self thank you.
Libra
Now is the perfect time to pick up a new healthy habit, Libra. If you’ve been meaning to eat healthier, pick up some more fruits and vegetables next time you’re at the store. Even something as simple as going on more walks can go a long way. 
Scorpio
Pay close attention to your relationships this week, Scorpio. This eclipse may hit you pretty hard since it is in your opposite sign, so carve out some quality time with those around you. Reach out to a friend you haven’t had a chance to catch up with in a while, even if it’s just a short study or coffee date. It’s also a good time to light a new flame in your love life and see where it takes you. 
Sagittarius
The eclipse will be in your eighth house of sex. Besides the obvious, the house also deals with money, making now a good time to keep a good grasp on your finances. Avoid impulsive purchases and opt for making more meals at home instead of ordering out. Although this is difficult for the adventurous Sagittarius, you’ll thank yourself later when you can use the money on a fun travel experience. 
Capricorn
Capricorn, you especially will be feeling an inclination toward introspection this week. Although it may feel unnatural, lean into it and take some time to understand your innermost values and aspirations. Think about how much you have grown since  last November’s eclipse season, and how you can use that to grow even more in the next year. 
Aquarius
Focusing on your career is ideal right now. Apply to some internships or take some time to hone in on your career path. If you are currently employed, set aside some extra time to focus on any projects you’ve been meaning to dive into; this will set you up nicely for the next year. 
Pisces
Your friends will get you through this emotional time, Pisces. Make sure you’re surrounding yourself with people who make you feel like your best self. It might be tempting to keep your head down this week, but even a simple text conversation during study breaks may go a long way.

“Cowboys are badass.” – Grey Dugan.
A busy Halloweekend night was well underway Thursday, with excited fans dressed as sexy nuns and strapping construction workers searching for parking at the sold out Catch One night club. The queue for entry spanned the block, and it was obvious from attendees’ beaming smiles that everyone was eager to see Dugan as they waited to enter the venue.
Grey Dugan is a 20-year-old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Now a junior studying philosophy, politics and economics  at USC, he resides in the Los Angeles area and hopes to establish himself as the next up-and-coming musical artist in the alternative indie rock genre.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Dugan has beaten the odds to single-handedly create and release quality music on a low budget. He takes pride in the control he exercises over every detail of his music, a quality which is crucial to him as an independent artist. The act of “doing it yourself” has proven to be quite successful for the young artist; on both Apple Music and Spotify, Dugan has released countless kaleidoscopic singles, extended plays and even a complete album. 
The bedroom rocker has garnered over one million streams on his 2020 single “Plant-Sitting This Weekend” alone. From the comfort of his homemade studio and his relentless effort to consistently release quality projects, Dugan is hand-making a name for himself. “DIY” might sound amateur, but not in his case.
On Thursday, Oct. 27th, Dugan’s success translated to the live music sphere when he played an eight song set at Catch One in L.A. 
Sporting cowboy hats, flannel shirts and leather boots, Dugan and his band looked badass as they took the stage. Despite his confident appearance, Dugan said he was actually very nervous at first. After years of filling in for other bands with his drum or bass skills, this was his first time taking center stage.
“I was super nervous. So nervous before,” Dugan said. “But I prepared so much. I rehearsed like, every day. I would run the setlist start to finish over and over again.” 
The setlist included many songs he’s released on streaming services, such as “I’ll Wait (Into the Sea)” and a Halloweekend-fitting “Psycho Killer,” along with a few unreleased tracks. 
Dugan and his band’s preparation was clear to audience members. Quinn Poseley, a junior studying political science,  fan of Dugan and concert attendee, described Dugan’s poise.
“He looked strong up there. He looked confident,” Poseley said. ‘I would not be able to tell that it was was first proper set [because he] seemed pretty comfortable.”
Dugan enjoyed the set as much as the crowd did. Even while lining up outside to get into the venue, fans were already excited and hyped to see the new artist perform. Poseley described the other audience members as “focused”; they were all there to watch Dugan do what he does best. 
Dugan made a loyal fan in Poseley, who said he is starting the “Grey Dugan Fan Club.”
Although many concert attendees knew Dugan’s music, there were also some who had never heard of the artist’s work before. Even people who weren’t particularly interested in the alternative indie rock genre were impressed by Dugan and enjoyed themselves at the show.
“Going into this, I wasn’t really sure what to expect,” said Grant Tucker, a junior majoring in business administration. “I would say I’m not the biggest fan of indie music. But, it was cool to hear … the show was pretty fun because Grey was up there.” 
After reflecting on the importance of this gig and the future that he hopes comes from it, Dugan confessed how fulfilling this first step was towards becoming the successful musical artist he wants to be. 
“It was significant,” he said. “It was like the first time any of those songs that I’ve recorded in my room saw the light of day. It’s pretty special.” 
Grey Dugan and his music can be found on Spotify, Apple Music and Instagram @greydugan.

Like many of you, I did not have “climate activists throw tomato soup on Van Gogh” on my 2022 Bingo card, but this year has been full of surprises. On Oct. 14, two members of the group Just Stop Oil splashed cans of tomato soup on Van Gogh’s famous “Sunflowers” painting in an escalation of their protests against the British government’s oil and gas projects.
Phoebe Plummer, one of the protestors involved in the act, explained that the group knew the painting was protected by glass, ensuring the soup would not damage one of Van Gogh’s seminal works. Their intention was to garner attention and start a conversation about government support of fossil fuel companies in light of our ongoing climate crisis.
Twitter was quick to jump into action as users offered their own criticisms and judgments of this act of civil disobedience. However, nobody can deny that this has kickstarted an important and timely conversation.
As climate change continues to decimate our planet, international governmental actions frequently support companies whose practices worsen the crisis. Annually, international governments offer between $775 billion and $1 trillion in oil, gas and coal subsidies.
Fossil fuels release harmful greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the already unsustainable rate at which our planet is warming.  These subsidies incentivize companies to continue extracting coal, oil and gas and dissuade corporate investments in clean, renewable energy.
Though there are countless interpretations of the soup thrown on “Sunflowers,” I find it interesting to consider how it implicates our collective diet in the fight against climate change.
In the words of Jason Hill, a professor in the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems at the University of Minnesota, “Food systems are sort of the dark horse of climate change.” From land clearing and deforestation to cattle’s methane-producing digestion, farming and ranching practices are responsible for nearly a third of our global carbon dioxide emissions.
Our current climate change goals are based on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose research has shown that holding warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels will limit climate change’s most devastating impacts.
To even dream of meeting this goal, we need drastic changes to our food systems. Studies have shown that fossil fuel emissions from food production alone will cause a climate increase that exceeds the 1.5 degree limit in about 30 to 40 years.
Curbing food system emissions requires a multi-faceted approach. We need to reduce production and consumption of foods that release the most greenhouse gases while also introducing more sustainable farming and herding practices.
While meat and dairy production emit the highest kilograms of greenhouse gases per kilogram of food produced, it’s unrealistic to expect the world to go vegan. Collective diet is a result of personal choice and cultural norms, so global diet changes require both individual action and government intervention. While individuals must make the decision to invest in plant-rich foods, government subsidies can lower the sticker prices for such foods to incentivize consumers.
Rather than pouring billions of dollars into fossil fuels, governments can more effectively allocate that money towards a push for plant-rich diets and a cleaner food production system. While a diet change is necessary in reducing industrial farming’s impact on climate change, it alone is not enough. 
Agricultural practices and climate change form a positive feedback loop. Techniques like deforestation for farmland, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and cultivation of flooded rice paddies emit a variety of planet-warming greenhouse gases. In response, global warming’s intensive weather events reduce crop yields and introduce new pests and weeds, forcing farmers to use even more intensive, greenhouse-gas-producing practices to meet global food demands.
Crop rotation, integrated pest management and no-till planting can reduce farming’s impact on climate change and improve long-term crop yields. With government support for environmentally conscious, sustainable agriculture, we can break this cycle.
We can spend weeks debating the efficacy of climate activism, but we can’t deny the need for change. For years, we’ve believed that we could innovate ourselves out of the mess we’ve made, but it’s becoming more and more clear that the problem is far more complicated and widespread than we imagined. Our solution must be just as complex and far-reaching as climate change itself.
Climate change is not a problem we can afford to ignore. If there is anything we can learn from sunflowers drenched in tomato soup, it is the need for immediate, transformative climate action.

By Ye JI JONG
Staff Writer 
Gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss — it seems like that’s the new mainstream motto for women’s empowerment. Female CEOs and entrepreneurs have been pushing for women to go into male-dominated industries and reach positions of power. From Wall Street to Big Tech, women are encouraged to “girlboss their way to the top” and take over the public sphere. It’s not what women can do for capitalism, but what capitalism can do for women. This all sounds empowering and liberating, so what’s the problem? 
Girlboss feminism fails to address one key issue: how can we be empowered at the expense of exploitation? 
To succeed in the game of capitalism, there must always be a loser for there to be a winner — and oftentimes women are the losers.  The term girlboss was coined by Sophia Amoruso, founder of Nasty Gal, an author and “girl boss” who made a fortune building an empire of fast fashion. She encouraged women to be unapologetically ambitious, oppose masculinity in power and gain capital as a form of feminist activism. 
Although she succeeded, her fortune was built on anti-feminist beliefs. The Daily Northwestern reported that “In June 2020, reports of unsafe working conditions and insufficient pay in factories that supply Boohoo, Nasty Gal’s parent company, emerged. The report revealed that the factory did not follow social distancing guidelines and workers were expected to continue working even after testing positive for the coronavirus. Additionally, the workers were paid as little at $4.40 an hour.”
While Amoruso succeeded, it came from underpaying and exploiting impoverished communities — the epitome of girlboss feminism. It’s not questioning the structure of capitalism or structural violence, but rather gaining power within those systems to beat the man. 
Oftentimes gaining power in this capitalist context comes at the expense of other women, as well. From sweatshop factories to sex work, girlboss feminism tends to further marginalize and profit off these gendered and harmful types of labor. Putting a woman in a position of power doesn’t guarantee she’ll make “feminist decisions.” 
But Amoruso isn’t alone. 
Nonprofit organizations and programs that purport to empower young girls to break into male-dominated fields can also produce similar outcomes. 
For example, Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code, made powerful statements about accountability and activism at Yale’s 2022 commencement ceremony. She stated, “[Our country] should be doing a hell of a lot more. It should be providing healthcare and childcare, saving our planet and our democracy, making the rich pay their fair share. And yes, making workplaces pay up,” when referring to government accountability. 
While her words held a lot of validity, I questioned whether her line of work followed suit. Girls Who Code, a feminist organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in tech, has previously partnered with companies like Meta and the Boston Consulting Group for opportunities in augmented reality, music and interview prep. But, isn’t it ironic that the same words of “making the rich pay their fair share” and “making workplaces pay” are referring to these same companies? These Fortune 500 corporations are responsible for widespread data collection and privacy violations, harmful misinformation and immense cash windfalls. They represent unchecked capitalism, which is at the core of gendered structural violence. 
But the problem isn’t the women who are in a position of power making harmful choices. The problem isn’t necessarily girlboss feminism or these pipelines to unethical corporations. In fact, I don’t think it’s right to blame women or a type of feminism for the issues that capitalism and the patriarchy have created. I think girlboss feminism and these pipelines are a product of oppression, because in all honesty, what other choice do women really have? 
Men have been succeeding with exploitive and aggressive tactics, but when girlboss feminists do it, it suddenly becomes an issue. Regardless of success or failure, women will be criticized for any type of activism. Marxist feminists are labeled as “dangerous radicals,” but liberal feminists are now “pick-me’s.” It seems too often that the common denominator is just misogyny. To be a woman is already seen as an opposition to men, thus being a woman displeased with the system is a threat to men. It’s a vicious cycle of misogyny, and for us to point fingers at women and feminist movements rather than the big picture is counter-intuitive.
So, to all the girlbosses out there: It’s not your fault. Don’t blame individual action for a systemic problem. Society was built against you, and in all honesty, there is no “ethical way to win.” Regardless of what you do or how you do it, the patriarchy is always going to find a way to rain on your parade. Of course, take constructive criticism and acknowledge the issues that come with girlbossing. Do your best to avoid adding to the problem you’re trying to fight against. But if a man ever tells you that you’re “doing it wrong,” feel free to gaslight and gatekeep him, because you’re a girlboss.

With the 2022 midterm elections just around the corner and contentious races for government office now in the endgame, California healthcare is also bracing for major change: Almost half of the propositions on the state ballot target healthcare.
Prop 1 is a constitutional amendment enshrining reproductive rights, including the right to an abortion; Prop 29 would, if passed, establish certain requirements for medical professionals at kidney dialysis clinics; Prop 31 would ban the sale of certain flavored tobacco products.
In a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman discussed the potential impacts of these propositions.
“The evidence around flavored tobacco products as a gateway for youth is very strong,” Van Orman said, referring to Prop 31. “Those of us who spend time thinking about public health and tobacco control think that these measures around flavored products are extremely important, and they’re actually a key policy position that helps reduce youth use of tobacco products and nicotine-containing products.”
Products targeted by Prop 31 came under heavy scrutiny in the past few months, after the Food and Drug Administration ordered e-cigarette company JUUL Labs, Inc. to remove their products from the market on Jun. 23. The agency later issued an administrative stay on the order after it was blocked by a federal appeals court.
Van Orman declined to comment on Prop 29, but said that healthcare establishments generally are “subject to a whole range of requirements,” including from the state, accrediting organizations and payers.
“Single-issue requirements for staffing are not the way we handle staffing at our other kinds of healthcare facilities,” Van Orman said. “There is a range of ways in which we determine who’s on site at various kinds of healthcare facilities, and those are often determined by the healthcare professionals who are delivering care in those facilities.”
Prop 1 was one of many reactions nationwide borne out of the Supreme Court’s Jun. 24 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced the amendment as a proposition just three days later, writing in a press release: “California will not back down from the fight to protection abortion rights.” 
While some worry that an influx of out-of-state abortion patients, further encouraged by Newsom, could strain California’s healthcare system, Van Orman said she does not expect the amendment to “have any immediate impact” if it were to pass.
“This is really a way of moving what is currently permitted in California by law into a right,” Van Orman said. “We know that people seek services because they need the services, and when they don’t seek services, it’s because they don’t have them available to them.”
Coronavirus cases climbed to 113 the week beginning Oct. 23, including self-reports and positive tests at Student Health. Van Orman attributed the increase to residual impacts from fall break.
“That was probably the more important event,” Van Orman said. “We have Halloween, we’ll now have homecoming; we do anticipate that as people gather, the numbers may continue to remain elevated.”
While Student Health did not observe “a bump” in cases during Halloween last year, Van Orman said large gatherings do see increases and precautions were necessary.
On Oct. 19, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control approved Novavax monovalent coronavirus boosters for adults aged 18 or older as an alternative to the bivalent Pfizer and Moderna boosters. Van Orman said the Novavax vaccine would not be available at the University, but it “still is available locally” as an option for individuals with concerns about mRNA vaccines.
“The Novavax uses an older technology that’s been around; it’s something we’ve used for immunizations for years,” Van Orman said. “So we encourage people who have concerns about the mRNA vaccines — even though they’re very safe — that they do have an option to still be protected.”

After serving as British Prime Minister for just 45 days, Liz Truss resigned from office Oct. 20, making her the shortest serving prime minister in British history. Her replacement, Conservative Rishi Sunak, has also made governmental history in the Isles, becoming the first person of color and of Indian descent to lead the country.
Truss’ resignation follows a failed tax-cutting budget geared towards the wealthy that disrupted financial markets and sparked controversy within the Conservative Party. Sunak, ushered in as prime minister a week after Truss stepped down, warned his country of strenuous economic conditions and difficult decisions ahead, pointing to the “mistakes” of his predecessors.
Sunak’s premiership on 10 Downing Street began shortly after inflation skyrocketed and the value of the British Pound fell to its lowest level since 1985.
Abba Wada, a sophomore from London studying industrial and systems engineering, believes that Truss’ resignation was appropriate, and said that her plans for reviving the country’s economy through tax cuts were undefined and therefore unattainable.
“I believe Rishi Sunak will adopt a completely different approach from Truss in his new role as Prime Minister,” Wada said. “Sunak is far more concerned with maintaining the stability of the poor strata of the British population in contrast to … [Truss’] first goals that involved reducing the growing tax burdens on the wealthy.”
Douglas Becker, an associate professor of political science, international relations and environmental studies at USC, said he believes that Sunak is an upgrade from Truss in that he’s not going to implement the same tax cuts but worries that he will be unable to navigate Britain’s crumbling economic situation.
“One of the challenges here is that the U.K. faces this deep economic crisis, and it’s going to take quite some time [to revive]. The gut reaction is austerity,” Becker said. “[But] right now, I think austerity will be disastrous because we are coming out of a pandemic … [Great Britain] actually needs a political consensus to make some very difficult choices, and they can’t do so under the current circumstances.” 
Nick Charles Currie, a senior majoring in journalism and a close follower of British politics, had trouble finding positives in Truss’ premiership.
“[Truss] was a very confusing choice at the time, and it’s good that she’s gone for the country,” Currie said. “It was just — it was a disaster from the start.”
Though relieved by Truss’ resignation, Currie has little faith in Sunak’s premiership. Currie, while recognizing the achievement in Sunak being the first British Asian prime minister and supporting Sunak far more than he did Truss, mentioned being hesitant to fully back the new prime minister. 
“He’s still not good. There was a leaked audio clip where [Sunak] talks to a very rich area, saying we need more money going to places like these instead of deprived urban areas … That’s bad,” Currie said.
Despite the flaws that Currie sees in Sunak, he said that Sunak’s adaptability, especially in his time as Chancellor of the Exchequer during the coronavirus pandemic, will enhance his premiership with the looming economic crisis. 
“Rishi Sunak, to his credit, is malleable, and that is one of the big things in his favor, because ideologically he is similar to Liz Truss,” Currie said. “But Sunak as Chancellor of the Exchequer in charge of the economy did not act [impulsively]. He was Chancellor during COVID, and he was willing to expand welfare [for Britons] … he’s willing to adjust to what the circumstances are.”
Among the changes that Sunak has made in the days since his appointment is resurrecting a fracking ban that Truss had eliminated during her premiership. Truss’ earlier announcement that she would lift a ban on fracking was met by resistance from members of parliament on both sides of the aisle, who worried about the environmental costs that the move would produce. 
“A [climate change conference] is coming up, and it’s easy to expect that [Britain] will take a little bit more of an aggressive position, in part because there is a small island coalition that’s been driving for stronger action on climate change, and the U.K. wants to be identified [as a leader],” Becker said. “[The ban on fracking] might be more symbolic than anything else.”
Wada also praised Sunak’s commitment to protecting the environment as well as his interest in cryptocurrency, which Wada said could be beneficial in terms of restricting climate change through reducing the production of paper money.
“I’m excited for Sunak to assume the role of Prime Minister because he’s interested in launching … Central Bank for Digital Currency, so digital currency for the U.K. would be offered by the official Bank of England,” Wada said. “[Sunak] is trying to place … economic stability and confidence at the heart of the government agenda.”

On Monday night, baseball fans around the country gathered together in sports bars or relaxed in solitude on their couches as they prepared to watch Game 3 of the World Series. The Houston Astros had answered the Philadelphia Phillies’ Game 1 victory with a 5-2 win of their own in Game 2.
With the Phillies not winning a World Series title since 2008 and the Astros’ most recent title coming amidst one of baseball’s most shocking cheating scandals since the Chattanooga Lookouts upped the price of their hot dogs by a dollar, the stakes for this years’ championship series are high.
So baseball fans across the world had to be pretty bummed when Game 3 was postponed due to inclement weather. The game was to be played in Philadelphia’s stadium, which does not have a retractable roof — which would have been nice in this situation. 
Seven MLB ballparks have permanent or retractable roofs, an investment that ensures that each game, for the most part, can stick to schedule. 
It is an investment, though. Retractable roofs add about 25 to 50 million dollars to the stadium construction budget. Additionally, it costs a few thousand just to open and close the roof each time.
Depending on the city, some MLB teams, like the Los Angeles Dodgers perhaps, don’t really need to make that investment — if anything L.A. is facing the opposite problem that plagued the Phillies and Astros on Monday night. 
It’s one thing to have a rain delay, it’s another to have a delay of rain.
The area surrounding L.A. is projected to see more long-term droughts and extreme heat waves by 2050. Of course, this doesn’t mean that come 2050 these natural disasters will suddenly increase — they will steadily ramp up as time goes by because of the worsening climate crisis. 
No rain and extreme heat doesn’t bode well for L.A. stadiums, specifically Dodger Stadium which, unlike SoFi Stadium and Crypto.com Arena, does not have a roof. 
But we don’t like rain as sports fans, right? I can think of countless times when rain has gotten in the way of my middle school lacrosse games or college football games I was enjoying with my dad — or a particular World Series Game 3 that I was planning on watching while putting together Tuesday’s edition of the Daily Trojan. 
Well, when it comes down to it, rain is pretty damn important and Southern California isn’t getting nearly enough of it. The lack of rain is contributing to the rising temperatures that will make it a nightmare to schedule daytime baseball games in the hot months of the summer. L.A. is projected to experience 3 times as many hot days in 2053 as this summer. A “hot day” is considered 94 degrees — L.A. County typically experiences around seven a year. Playing or watching baseball in the hot sun at noon on an August day will grow less and less appealing to one of baseball’s most loyal fanbases.
My speculation is that Dodger Stadium will adapt to the worsening climate. Something tells me that a team valued at over $4 billion would be able to construct whatever system is needed to beat the heat, whether it be a roof to block the sun and/or an advanced air conditioning system.
But, in this future world that seems apocalyptic — and is not the worry but expectation of climate scientists — I bet most of the high schools in L.A. will not be able to afford to construct climate-beating state-of-the-art sports complexes. As the heat grows worse, I predict many high schools will be forced to cancel some of their sports programs — or at least delay the start of fall sports until the temperatures, well, fall. 
Additionally, if these extended droughts continue, the city and county budgets will likely become even more stretched than they are today. Keeping high school football around isn’t as important as clean water access or landslide prevention (as landslides are more likely in climates experiencing droughts).
Sometimes when I think of the future, I picture something that isn’t the most appealing to me. It’s the sad reality that climate change has imposed on us, and it’s easy to get bogged down thinking about some dystopian future where water is currency and baseball is a thing of the past and the wealthy are in built-up castles plugged into virtual reality machines. 
I didn’t necessarily think I would get political when I began this column this morning, but when you vote on Tuesday, think of the climate and what you want your future to look like. Because personally, I hope to see you, in the sunshine, at a Dodgers game 30 years from now.

Audrey and Nicole Nourse have an uncanny knack for teamwork and communication. 
Except, it’s not just a strong friendship between teammates. The two USC senior elite beach volleyball players are identical twins, and that relationship has fostered an even more profound connection.
Their relationship was obvious when interviewing them. They took turns answering questions and passed off answers to one another as seamlessly as they pass a volleyball back and forth.   
Their unparalleled closeness was obvious to Reed Martin as well. Martin, a junior majoring in film and television production, was making content for the Athletic Department at a USC women’s beach volleyball match in 2020 when the Nourse twins caught his eye. 
“All of a sudden, I get fixated on a court next to me because I’m like, ‘These two girls look like they’re twins,’” Martin said. “There’s very few [times in sports] where there’s a pair of twins like this that are the entire team basically, they are their own team, no one else is out there. So I just thought that was really interesting.” 
As a filmmaker, Martin was immediately fascinated by the idea of doing a documentary on their unique bond as twins and  teammates. 
So he began assembling a team of USC students, including Max Stafford, a producer and senior majoring in cinema and media studies. Stafford, who frequently collaborates with Martin on films that Martin directs, was also immediately fascinated by the bond that the twins shared. 
“I’ve always thought of twins [as] so similar that it must be hard to actually be friends with one another, but with Audrey and Nicole, their friendship defines a lot of their athletic success,” Stafford said. 
Fortunately for Martin, Stafford and their team, the twins were equally interested in the documentary. 
“It was a great opportunity for us to really share our story because we do have somewhat of a large following on social media, but not everyone really knows what we’re about,” Nicole said. “It was really fun to give our audience a different side of ourselves that maybe they didn’t know about.” 
It also gave them an avenue to pursue partnerships with companies looking for collaborations with college athletes. 
“We’re also right now trying to build our brand and trying to profit off [of] our [Name, Image, and Likeness], and [the documentary] is just a great tool to use,” Audrey said.
And, just as Martin was initially awestruck by the twins’ volleyball skill, they greatly appreciated his film expertise. 
“When [Martin] had reached out to us originally, he had shown us some of his previous work … he’s really good at what he does,” Audrey said. 
The partnership between well-regarded sports documentarians and a great sports story worked well immediately, and “Nourse Twins: Beach Sisters” was born. 
“Nourse Twins: Beach Sisters” satisfies the same kind of fans of the hit Michael Jordan documentary “The Last Dance.” The intriguing premise, explosive highlights from the twins’ playing career, behind-the-scenes look at their lives and in-depth interviews blend together into an emotional and exciting documentary just as “The Last Dance” did before. 
The length and finality of “The Last Dance” are two things that are noticeably absent from “Nourse Twins: Beach Sisters.” But, that is part of its beauty. While “The Last Dance” looked back decades after the Chicago Bulls’ 1990s dynasty and comprised over eight hours of footage, you can watch the Nourse twins’ documentary in a mere 12 minutes, and you’ll see the careers and dynasty they are establishing is far from over. 
The back-to-back national champion USC women’s beach volleyball team will be seeking a three-peat of their own this season, and the documentary is a perfect preview of the season to come. Like any good season preview, it recaps the story of previous seasons and sets the potential for even bigger things to come for the twins. 
“We’ve won two national championships, but I want to win two more,” Nicole said. “I want to leave here with four rings. … I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to, I don’t think either Audrey or I are satisfied with even two. We want to go out with a bang. We want to leave the program better than we found it.”
As for the filmmakers, the film serves as a preview for them too. The documentary is a short one, but in those 12 minutes, they provide a snapshot of their wide range of storytelling skills that they could bring to bigger, longer projects in the future. 
“[Athletes] all have very interesting stories that sometimes need help being amplified,” Stafford said. “I think there’s a lot of really cool stories of hard work and dedication that maybe people don’t really see in athletes just because it [takes place] a little more behind the scenes.” 
“Nourse Twins: Beach Sisters” is for everyone at USC. Sports fans will love the blend of athletic excellence and intriguing storyline that Audrey and Nicole Nourse bring to the game of beach volleyball. 
But even the average USC student who may not care for sports has something to gain from watching it as well. 
“The way that they approach beach volleyball is the way that they approach everything in life,” Martin said. “I think that’s the biggest takeaway for me, and I think that should hopefully be one of the key takeaways for other people, to apply that [athlete’s] mindset to whatever it is they do.”
The documentary can be found on Vimeo (search “Nourse Twins: Beach Sisters”) and some of Reed’s other work with Stafford and others can be found at reedmartin.co. 
The Nourse twins will be found in pursuit of a three-peat at Merle Norman Stadium in the spring. 
The unique blend of skill of everyone involved in the project is worth witnessing because these brilliant Trojans’ stories are already so good — and the next scene might be even better yet.

There wasn’t much glory for the Trojans, who finished dead last at the Pac-12 cross country championship in Riverside on Friday.
The last four runners to finish in the 105-person field were Trojans. One runner dropped out because of ankle pain and the team’s highest-placing athlete, freshman Lucy Westlake, finished in 78th place. A good portion of the team’s veterans didn’t suit up at all, sidelined by illness and injury.
“You can’t control the uncontrollables,” Coach Jebreh Harris said. “We’re gaining some experience.”
It was fairly clear what the day would hold from the onset of the gun.
The Trojans found themselves boxed to the back of a relatively tight pack at the quarter mile mark, mixing it up with trailing runners from Arizona State and California. By the 2k split, the race began to string out, with Westlake and fellow freshman Ashlee Gallegos crossing the mat side-by-side in 83rd place.
Somewhere between the 2k and 4k marks, sophomore Maya Lacamp — who ran at the NCAA West Regional last year — hobbled off the course with a twisted ankle. Meanwhile on the deceptively steep course, Westlake pushed to gain seven places, crossing the 4k line in 76th place with Gallegos following some 30 seconds later.
Westlake finished the day with a 78th place, 21:37 6k followed by Gallegos in 92nd, sophomore Vienna Gao in 97th, senior Janiah Brown in 101st, senior Brooke Rodi in 102nd, redshirt freshman Jacqueline Duarte in 103rd and sophomore Giovanna Pisano in 104th. Both Westlake and Gao — who earned a spot on the team this year in a tryout — set new 6k personal bests.
In the two meets she’s run this season, Westlake has finished first for the Trojans; Gallegos led the charge at the last regular season race, when Westlake didn’t run.
“The athletes who were out there today stepped up because other teammates were not able to come out and compete,” Harris said. “People stood up for each other when other teammates were down.”
This year’s Pac-12 finish wasn’t much of an anomaly for a program that has historically finished at the bottom of the Pac-12; the squad was, as per usual, outclassed by the likes of Colorado, Oregon and Stanford — powerhouse distance programs in one of the strongest conferences in the NCAA.
Colorado won the meet on a tie breaker with Utah, followed by, in order of rank: Oregon, Stanford, Washington, Oregon State, Washington State, UCLA, Arizona, California, Arizona State and USC.
