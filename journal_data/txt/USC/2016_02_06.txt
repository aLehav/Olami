Air + Style is kicking off its second annual two-day festival in Los Angeles on Feb. 20 and 21 at EXPO Park at the L.A. Coliseum. The event, hosted by snowboarding Olympian Shaun White. Along with the festival’s live music, Air + Style features a 16-story high skateboard ramp, professional athlete appearances and local art culture. The music festival originated in Innsbruck, Austria as a snowboard competition, expanded to Beijing, China due to its growing popularity, then eventually integrated the musical component of the whole event.
Air + Style has had great impact in the L.A. area. Besides capturing the laid-back yet upbeat vibe of the city, this multifaceted festival has enjoyed positive reception since its debut showcase in L.A. last year. As the TransWorld SNOWboarding magazine noted, “The juxtaposition of the musical acts with contest snowboarding provided an interesting array of entertainment for the sprawling crowd that was dotted with overly eager teenagers, rock-oriented hipsters, LA socialites, partying parents and a plethora of photographers, both professional and amateur.”
Perhaps the most unique music festival of its kind, Air + Style has a lineup this year offers a diverse range of genres which includes hip-hop, alternative, and rap, and electronic, with main headliners J. Cole and Incubus. The lineup also incorporates international artists such as All Time Low, Rudimental, and A-Trak and Southern Californian talents such as HAIM and Travis Barker.
This event is open to all ages, and the venue is right across Exposition Boulevard from University Park Campus.
Full lineup: J. Cole, Incubus, Kaskade, HAIM, Big Grams, All Time Low, Action Bronson, Rudimental, A-Trak, Gramatik, Netsky, A$AP Ferg, Danny Brown, Flatbush Zombies, Travis Barker, The Struts, Migos, Allie X, Kaneholler and Bas, Cozz & Omen.
Tickets for Air + Style are available here.

The month of February is often associated with the glamorization of Valentine’s Day, adorned with pink and red hearts as couples celebrate their love for one another. But it’s about more than just cutout shapes and fluttering hearts — February is also American Heart Month. 
Heart disease, the nation’s leading cause of death, kills about 610,000 Americans annually — that’s one in every four deaths, according to the CDC. Tracing back a few steps, more than 67 million Americans have high blood pressure, which is the leading cause in both stroke and heart disease, the leading cause of death in America. 
So, this February, instead of just telling someone how much you care about them, consider showing how much you care informing them of simple steps they can take including balancing a healthy diet. Here are a few heart-healthy foods to incorporate into your diet, broken down by meal: 
Breakfast
In the morning, try ditching your sugary cereal or protein shake packed with who knows what and opt for a warm bowl of oatmeal with blueberries and a cup of coffee. If you pick old-fashioned or even quick-cook oatmeal (not the sugary, flavored, and instant packs) you can help lower your cholesterol as oatmeal acts as an absorbing sponge in your digestive tract. Consider topping off your oatmeal with blueberries or other berries high in antioxidant levels as they help decrease blood pressure. And you can still keep your morning cup of coffee! Although studies are mixed, recent data has shown that drinking a cup or two a day can help reduce your chance of stroke and cardiovascular disease by nearly 30 percent.

Lunch
For lunch, try a hearty salad over California Pizza Kitchen or Panda Express. Being high in fiber, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and even omega-3 fatty acids, you can’t go wrong with kale, broccoli or spinach. To add some depth and flavor, toss in tomatoes and avocado and coat with olive oil. Both avocado and extra virgin olive oil are high in good fats which can reduce the risk of getting heart disease and tomatoes help rid the body of cholesterol and help keep veins open. For a snack, consider munching on some nuts or citrus fruit to pack yourself rich of Vitamin C and good fats that also help in prevention.

Dinner
For dinner, consider the often claimed “all-star” for heart healthy food: salmon. Aside from the fatty acids, salmon has properties that help lower the risk of arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, and decrease triglycerides. Pair your salmon with salad or broccoli if you did not earlier, or try a type of legume (beans, lentils, etc), and potatoes. Beans can help control sugar levels in people with diabetes which is crucial in preventing a serious complication such as heart disease. And potatoes are rich in potassium which helps with blood pressure and high in fiber which also reduces risk of disease.

As for dessert? 
Indulge in a bite or two of dark chocolate, meaning at least 60 to 70 percent cocoa. The flavonoids in dark chocolate can help reduce clotting, inflammation and can help improve blood pressure. In the evening, feel free to have a few sips of red wine or green tea. Both can aid in a happy mind and a happy heart.

Bonita Nongluk | Daily Trojan
Last year, I was the leader of two clubs, Inklings and the Teen Awareness Group. Last year, I also fully grew into who I am now and who I will remain for the rest of my life — a person I am very proud to be.
There were three people in these organizations who helped me the most in becoming the person I am today. I owe them more than can be expressed with words, despite my love of writing.
One of them, M.E. Fulco, has been through everything with me throughout my four years of high school. I mean that literally — she was my teacher every single year and my adviser for two years, and she will remain one of my close friends for the rest of my life.
Unfortunately, the other two wonderful people who so shaped the person I’ve become, Chris Lemone and Cody Thomas, recently passed away, within a few short months of each other.
So many people were affected by these ridiculously untimely deaths; I know that I’m not alone in grieving them, and I know that my feelings of loss are no more important than anyone else’s. However, having also been a leader of the two clubs that these amazing men headed, I feel pressure to be able to make sense of it. But the more I try, the more I realize that there is no sense to be made.
So instead, I’ve tried so cringingly hard to find something, anything, a little less negative about this incredibly dark experience. Somehow, I managed to sculpt together two things:
ONE is how lucky I am to have known these people at all, to have people in my life who were so much a part of me that they left a hole when they left. I also realized that this hole is filled with the part of me that formed from being around their influential presences for so long — like the part of me that tries to makes others proud, like Cody always did and the part of me that tells it like it is, to myself and others, like Chris always did.
TWO is how lucky I am to be alive, to be here in this moment. Nothing is as bad as it first appears if you can constantly remind yourself that you’re breathing — that you can see the beautiful sky, smell the fresh air, taste cold mint chocolate chip ice cream, feel someone’s hand in yours and hear your friends laugh.
And I know, I know that that doesn’t make it suck any less. It will always suck. There is nothing that can be done about the fact that it sucks besides accepting that it does.
However, if there is anything to take away from this, it is that everyday we should take time to show gratitude and appreciation for the people in our lives that we love and who love us, including ourselves.
