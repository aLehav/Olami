When Diana Greer first arrived at the Rossier School of Education, she had trouble finding a Latinx community to connect with on campus until she discovered the Latino Graduate Student Association during her first year.
“I felt like I didn’t have a lot of Latinx friends in my cohort, or I didn’t see many, so I decided to start coming out to mixers and events,” said Greer, a second-year graduate student studying educational counseling. “[LGSA] just became like family instantly. To be able to hang out with students who look like you, talk like you, maybe eat the same food as you — it was very comforting for me, at a predominantly white institution, to be able to find Latinx students on campus.”
For Greer and many students like her, LGSA is a vital on-campus resource. The group is dedicated to helping Latinx graduate students find new and exciting opportunities in their fields and foster professional networks to support them after they leave USC.
A year after joining the group, Greer became its co-president. Along with co-president Laura Delgado, a third-year graduate student studying educational counseling, she plans programming that connects graduate students within the Latinx community. Some of the organization’s most popular events include Noche de Estrellas, an end-of-year celebration for members, and an annual Friendsgiving dinner for those who are unable to go home for Thanksgiving. 
Recently, the organization partnered with Graduate Student Government to host a general body meeting and discuss issues USC’s Latinx graduate student community faces. The two groups invited graduate students to voice their opinions and speak directly to those who effect campus policy. GSG Director of Diversity and Equity for Programming Xavier Hernandez said the town hall-style event was a huge success. 
“Seeing the [general body meeting] was a big step in allowing everyone to come together,” said Hernandez, who is studying integrated design, business and technology. “Being able to see all of us together in one space at one time, chatting about how we can empower each other and make our lives better … was really powerful.”
The Undergraduate Mentoring Program, or UMP, is one of LGSA’s larger initiatives. Undergraduates get paired with a graduate student mentor who can give them advice on navigating college.
Greer said that the team takes time to assign all 25 students on the roster to a mentor who shares their interests, looking for commonalities in hometown, major and background when choosing each pair.
Greer said LGSA’s events and programming initially drew her to the organization because she wanted a place to celebrate and connect with her culture. Greer, a mother of one, said LGSA also helped connect her to other Latinx parents on campus and helped her find a community at USC.
“Right away, one of the students came to my classroom and said there [were] a lot of student parents that come that [I] just didn’t know [were] parents,” Greer said. “He connected me to other student parents and from there I was able to create a single mother USC type of support group for myself.”
For Delgado, connections like these make LGSA so vital to the Latinx community on campus. As co-president, she hopes to facilitate these relationships throughout the coming year.
“[Our most important role] is to foster community,” Delgado said. “It’s a very different experience, being a graduate student compared to being an undergrad. We want to foster this sense of belonging.”

The Iovine and Young Academy and the Keck School of Medicine’s Medicine, Engineering, Science and Humanities Academy introduced a health innovation minor that will be available in Spring 2020, according to Academy communication manager Karine Kim. 
According to Kim, the new minor allows students to combine their interests across different schools to create innovations in the medical field. The program introduces students who are interested in the healthcare field to the cross-disciplinary curriculum of the Academy by offering courses covering both business and medical topics. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Kim wrote that the Academy is finalizing the application process for the minor, but she hopes to keep a lower bar of entry for the program.
“Students who minor in health innovation will have the opportunity to learn and apply the Academy’s proven methodologies toward their specific interests in health,” Kim wrote. “The abilities and knowledge gained from the minor could, for example, be applied toward the development of new technologies, new methods or systems for managing health related data and information, medical startups or driving new ideas or policies relating to human health.”
Armine Lulejian, senior director of educational initiatives at Keck, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan that she hopes the new minor will teach students to become more innovative and develop a strong interdisciplinary foundation. 
“In order to take full advantage of the entrepreneurial and research opportunities in health innovations space, this health innovation minor is necessary for a new generation of learners — agile and adaptive thinkers who cross easily from discipline to discipline, steadily advancing the role that technology plays in our present and our future,” Lulejian wrote. 
Academy sophomore Mark Veksler said that the innovative thinking that Iovine and Young classes utilize could revolutionize the typically slow-moving field of medicine.
“I think that what Iovine and Young brings to the table is just a general sense of innovation and design thinking,” Veksler said. “And I think that a lot of it changes a little bit slow in the medical field, so I think that [the health innovation minor] would definitely better that.”
Nina Cragg, a sophomore in the Academy, said the new minor aligns with the way the fields of health and technology are combining in the real world.
“I do think that there’s a huge future in terms of what wearable tech will look like,” Cragg said. “I think that a lot of innovation will be around health tech.”
According to Kim, the curriculum was designed by faculty and researchers at IYA and Keck. She said IYA received a grant from Phase ONE Cancer Foundation in 2017 to expand the partnership to create course offerings for students who “wish to focus on innovating across health and well-being.” 
“The Academy has been partnered with USC Keck since 2015 through the Kuhn Lab and the Michelson Center Convergent Science Institute in Cancer,” Kim wrote. “Since that time, Academy students have continually worked with teams of USC faculty, researchers and physicians toward new ideas for patient-facing technologies and platforms.”
As medicine and technology innovation begin to merge, the health innovation minor allows students to gain expertise in both areas, Cragg said. 
“I think that [health technology] will really shape our future in many ways,” Cragg said. “There’s a ton of room for growth.”

Thirty-nine percent of students in the U.S. deal with some sort of mental health problem, according to data from the Healthy Minds Survey. This study highlights a common factor that limits students from thriving in college: loneliness. Loneliness can have serious effects on mental and physical well-being and is a major risk factor for depression, according to an article in the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research. 
On top of that, moving to college is incredibly difficult. It’s a new environment, you likely don’t know many people — if anyone — and at any class level, you’re likely faced with tremendous academic, professional, social and internal stressors. At USC, all of this is even more daunting, considering there are 47,500 high-achieving students from all around the world surrounded by a dynamic, busy city with millions of residents. It’s a big transition for everyone, no matter their background. 
This considered, students are commonly told to “find their community on campus” to adjust to the new environment. But why is this so important? Some say it’s to gain professional skills or pursue intellectual interests. Others say it’s to make yourself more marketable to graduate programs and build your resume. While these can be attractive advantages, the most immeasurable benefit to finding your community on campus is building emotional connections and peer-to-peer support systems that, according to research published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence, help limit the feeling of loneliness and support the goal of thriving. 
As crises arise, students first turn to those in their groups for support. Peers are more approachable, more relatable and more accessible. They understand you at greater depths than most and can empathetically relate to the stressors of college life. This is why it is critical for student groups to designate a director of member well-being position that seeks to empower their members through education, connections to resources and an organizational culture of peer-to-peer caring. 
With numerous involvement opportunities at USC through the more than 1,100 registered student organizations, 50 Greek chapters and large communities through USC Athletics, recreational sports, student government, the Admissions Center and more, student communities are ideal places to promote well-being. 
In each of these communities, students can find a sense of belonging in an otherwise overwhelming, big-college environment. Organizations allow students to build connections, support systems and friends, among myriad other professional, academic and extracurricular benefits. Taking part in student groups has incredible well-being benefits. According to the Bringing Theory to Practice Project, a research initiative in which USC participates, students joining together for a common cause helps “with feelings of self-efficacy, self-confidence, self-esteem and satisfaction with daily activities.” In turn, when personal and community needs arise, students are likely to turn to their organizations for assistance. Research suggests that the causal relationship between stress and loneliness can be buffered by friend-to-friend support networks — meaning your peers are the ones you’re likely to first turn to and are the ones to first support you. 
By national data, students are increasingly self-reporting declining mental health over the last few decades. Meanwhile, universities including USC work to expand support services, such as implementing more-accessible counseling and intervention services. For a large school like USC, the only way to address emotional well-being and support the reduction of suicide and substance abuse is to work at a University-wide level. 
USC offers many support services through groups like Student Health, Student Affairs, Campus Wellbeing and Education, student government and academic departments but a big gap for students in achieving a sense of thriving — apart from the benefits of joining a student community — is a lack of awareness about professional resources. Currently, many of the aforementioned departments are making incredible efforts and strides in their resource promotion and outreach. However, there is still a gap between administrative units and the student body due to students naturally reaching out to friends in their communities as a first step and sometimes as their only step. This is particularly true if they are unaware of resources on campus. Thus, it is critical to take a peer-led, grassroots and University-wide approach in supporting the well-being and thriving of all students. 
One approach is for student groups — RSOs, Greek chapters and other student communities alike — to create a director of member well-being position in their respective organizations. With the right education from the University, directors of member well-being would be aware of on- and off-campus resources and be trained to direct their members to the appropriate support systems, which can help students work through stressors and identify solutions to crises. 
The benefits of this type of role are three-fold. One, given there are 1,100 RSOs and dozens of other student communities, thousands of students would have a heightened responsibility to be aware of well-being resources and to help lead peer-to-peer resource awareness as well as a support network. Two, USC departments, such as Student Health, would be able to more easily identify people to reach out to and more effectively connect students from across campus with critical resources. And three, students would be able to identify a designated peer who could confidently guide them to professional support services. 
As of now, Undergraduate Student Government, in discussion with USC Student Health, is working on health promotion and outreach strategies, which include well-being training modules for students and RSOs. On top of this, as some organizations — such as the Panhellenic Council and many of its chapters — have already begun to create the director of member well-being position, it is imperative to take into consideration the well-being and support ecosystem surrounding the position itself. 
The director should by no means be solely responsible for carrying the weight of all members’ needs or fixing students’ circumstances. Instead, they should play an accessible, guiding role in connecting their members to professional services. Some of these resources include Crisis Support and Intervention, THRIVE: Foundations of Well-being and Mindful USC — which reaches more than 7,000 people per year according to Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni — among other services like counseling and mental health. The University should ensure directors go through a training module as well as provide consistent touchpoints to check in and provide personalized assistance. Where relevant and possible, student governing groups like USG should also play a supportive role with these directors and ensure there are adequate resources and communication from the University. 
Creating these roles will help pair tight-knit student communities with resource providers, ensuring that as many students as possible are resource-aware and feel comfortable asking for help through the backing of their peers. With such a system, students can better help each other access valuable resources at USC. In turn, these communities, which already encourage belonging and thriving in their own ways, can also connect students to critical professional support services, further empowering the well-being of all students.

The Hindi word “Aarambh” can be translated to English as “start or beginning.” It is no surprise that Aarambh is the title chosen for FIDAA and USC’s first-ever dance convention. 
FIDAA is the most recent addition to USC’s diverse range of dance organizations. The club is founded and directed by junior Jainil Mehta. Mehta, who is majoring in dance, has an extensive background in Indian folk, Indian classical, ballet and hip-hop and has even choreographed three dance productions in Mumbai. Mehta’s passion and expertise is undeniable. 
With the creation of FIDAA, he hopes to extend this same excitement to the USC community.
“FIDAA’s main purpose is to promote the arts and promote dance in the community — and it’s not just particularly to the South Asian community, but to the [USC] community in general,” Mehta said. “We aim to make dance for fun instead of making it competitive.” 
The group’s determination to reach this goal is clearly seen in the development of Aarambh. Though organizing a convention is a huge task for a new club, Mehta said that they would rather “start with a bang instead of … baby steps.”
The convention will be held from Oct. 11 to 13 and hopes to introduce the community to a variety of global dance styles such as belly dancing, kathak, Indian Folk and flamenco.
“We are actually getting a lot of choreographers recognized — [including] professional choreographers — from the Los Angeles community as well as New York and Mumbai … and they are going to be teaching at the convention to people who are passionate about dance and want to learn something new,” Mehta said.
Along with its new convention, the group hosts dance workshops at Mudd Hall Monday nights. Each night culminates with a free-for-all cipher — a circle of improvisatory dance where everyone gets to dance to whatever they want, however they want.
Ultimately, the group and its workshops are a space for expression for any student regardless of background.
“[These workshops are for] people who are kind of intimidated to join a team or not really comfortable in putting a bunch of commitment,” said Sweta Bhagavatula, the associate director of FIDAA. “I think it would be better to have a low-commitment club and something they can have as a stressbuster.”
Bhagavatula explains that the challenge for the group, as with any newly-established club, is spreading awareness of the organization out to the general public. Yet, the club is swiftly combating this issue by collaborating with Southern California Indo-Americans, an on-campus organization that seeks to support South Asian culture — but the group isn’t solely for the South Asian community.
“By collaborating with SCIA, [FIDAA has] reached our mailing list, our Instagram and our Facebook followers,” said Kishan Patel, the co-president of SCIA.
As FIDAA continues to reach out to USC students, its motto of promoting “[dancing] for fun” for any student continues.

As we say goodbye to the first third of our fall semester, we welcome the season of pumpkin spice lattes, sweaters and dreaded midterms. The stress that comes with this time of year can be overwhelming, especially with the avalanche of testing in course after course, week after week. Wine can be a source of calmness during periods of high stress if done in the right way. 
There is a cardinal rule for drinking wine to calm yourself: less is more. Limiting yourself to a glass of wine can do wonders, especially when you find yourself in a slump when studying or facing writer’s block. While my perspective on whether to drink white or red wine is to just drink whichever one you like best, the science points out that red wine helps lower the risk of Alzheimer’s and increases your lifespan. Interpret that how you wish.
A glass of 2017 Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($20) produced by the Hobo Wine Company in Sonoma County can relieve some of the anxiety you may be harboring during midterms. This young and approachable Cab has subtle notes of cherry and chocolate, which will seemingly enchant you and immerse you into nature — perhaps sitting by a serene waterfall. It is relatively versatile in terms of food pairings, so any snacks you bought on a whim from Trader Joe’s will do the trick. 
But if you are looking for some excitement as you trudge through exams to our first-ever fall break or to treat yourself after that long study session in that soul-draining place known as Leavey Library, treat yourself to Delinquente’s Bullet Dodger ($22) from South Australia. Keep in mind the saying “don’t judge a book by its cover” when approaching this wine. It’s a light Australian Shiraz that is easy to drink and is influenced by the ruggedness of the outback and the breeze of the Australian oceanside. You’ll taste the mingling of raspberries and cranberries with flowery spices that take your tastebuds on that Australian Outback adventure you didn’t know you needed.
Have you ever heard of Itata? No, not Italy. It’s a place in Chile. And in my experience drinking wine, the ones from Chile never fail to surprise me. The 2016 Pencopolitano ($27) from Pedro Parra y Familia will take you on a mystical journey through the Chilean countryside in the midst of all these tests. The important thing to remember about this wine is its fruity and floral aroma, with hints of raspberry, mint, pepper and salted plum. It’s as if you bought some expensive candles to light up your room while you studied. Like most Chilean wines, this one has a strong draw to its terroir (the natural environment in which the wine is produced, such as soil, topography, climate, etc.), which is steeped in many years of history. 
With midterms, recruitment and social activities, this time of year can be stressful. It’s important to take a few minutes out of your day to de-stress and relax. So have a seat, lie back and wine down.

Associate professor of theatre practice Elsbeth Collins carries her passion for theater into her daily work as head of production for the School of Dramatic Arts. After graduating from Princeton University with a degree in art history and working as a stage manager for more than 25 years, Collins decided to transition to work as a director of production. Her role and position as a vital member of the School of Dramatic Arts are best described by Collins herself. 
“As head of production, I’m responsible for everything that goes on stage,” Collins said. “I supervise the costume shop manager and the theater manager.” 
She said that her responsibilities also include coordinating with other departments to make sure everything is running smoothly for any show, from the first rehearsal to the final curtain.
With extensive stage management knowledge and 11 years of experience at SDA, Collins has organization and time management skills like no other. 
“The stage manager [juggles] a lot of different balls in the air,” Collins said. “They have to be a cheerleader, they have to be extremely time-sensitive and not wasting time and being very efficient, and they have like five voices in their heads because they’re on a headset, and they’re talking to all the designers plus the director.” 
Amid the organized chaos of putting together each production, it’s her passion for theater and guiding students in achieving their visions that serves as the real reward of it all. 
Part of her reward is that Collins is able to pass on her knowledge and expertise to the next generation of theater students every year.
“[Students are] trying to make the director’s vision happen and the designer’s visions happen, and for me to watch the students doing that is really, really gratifying,” Collins said.
After calling SDA home for the past 11 years, Collins reflected on the aspects that make USC’s dramatic arts program so special to both her and the students. 
“I love the staff and the faculty that I work with, and the students are all so passionate about doing this thing we call theater,” Collins said. “It’s really invigorating for me to realize that young people are wanting to do what I did when I was their age, and they’re still passionate about it and they’re very bright, and they bring a lot of creativity to their work, and it’s just a lot of fun.”
With an exciting season ahead, the Dramatic Arts school strives to plan all productions and logistics a year ahead of time, producing and performing in nine shows this fall followed by 11 shows in the Spring 2020 semester. Although there is  a long list of productions that Collins is enthusiastic about for the upcoming season, she is particularly looking forward to “The Cider House Rules, Part One: Here in St. Cloud’s” and “Men on Boats.” “Men on Boats” is particularly exciting for both Collins and the SDA staff because it has taken them two or three years to get royalties for the production. 
Collins encourages all students to watch these productions, regardless of whether they have a previous theater background.
“Theater is relevant to us all,” Collins said. “I mean, especially in this time that we’re living in that is so uncertain and so out of our control, that sometimes to go and sit in a theater — a dark theater —and share a communal experience … an emotional bonding experience with other people. It’s my church.” 
Collins believes that even students who do not have a strong interest in theater can take advantage of the experience of watching a production not only from an entertainment perspective but a meditative one as well.
“Sitting in the theater reminds me of how human we all are and how we all depend on each other, and I think that’s the value of it,” Collins said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Monday that will grant California’s college athletes the ability to be compensated for the use of their name, image or likeness. The bill will take effect Jan. 1, 2023.
The legislation is set to give student-athletes the ability to hire agents and sign endorsement deals, which is strictly prohibited under current NCAA regulations. It also forbids universities from banning these paid athletes.
“Colleges reap billions from student athletes but block them from earning a single dollar,” Newsom tweeted after signing the bill. “That’s a bankrupt model.”
Earlier this month, the NCAA threatened to bar 58 California collegiate athletic programs from competing should Newsom sign the bill into law, arguing that a financial incentive would give these programs a leg up in recruiting athletes. Some of the country’s top competitors — including USC, UCLA, Stanford and Cal — would be the victims of this proposed ban.
However, the version of the bill passed Monday states that the NCAA cannot bar California schools from competition based on the compensation of their student-athletes.
Newsom said the bill may prompt other states to pass similar legislation, which could force the NCAA to change its regulations on amateurism.
Conversely, the NCAA released a statement Monday that it recognizes the need to revise its current policy, but that the California bill is the wrong way to go about making these changes.
“As a membership organization, the NCAA agrees changes are needed to continue to support student-athletes, but improvement needs to happen on a national level through the NCAA’s rules-making process,” the statement read. “Unfortunately, this new law already is creating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California.”
The University issued a statement Monday echoing the NCAA’s sentiment.
“We agree it is crucial to have a serious conversation on the appropriate manner in which student-athletes can license their name, image and likeness for commercial gain,” the statement read. “We also continue to believe strongly that a national framework is needed to address those issues to ensure our student-athletes are treated fairly and do not face a potential ban from NCAA competition.”
The University also wrote in its statement that it is concerned about whether the athletes’ eligibility to compete will be compromised after the bill takes effect.
“Without future legislative updates, we are concerned that our student-athletes will lose their ability to compete, and recruitment at California universities will suffer significantly,” the University wrote.
Newsom signed the bill on NBA star Lebron James’ talk show “The Shop: Uninterrupted.”
James, who went professional out of high school, has been a staunch supporter of paying athletes whose sports generate immense revenue for their schools.
“NCAA, you got the next move,” James wrote on Instagram. “We can solve this for everyone!”
The law may be challenged by the NCAA before its 2023 introduction. The organization has hinted that it may take the issue to the courts, and an argument could be made given Congress’ authority to oversee interstate commerce.
“As more states consider their own specific legislation related to this topic, it is clear that a patchwork of different laws from different states will make unattainable the goal of providing a fair and level playing field for 1,100 campuses and nearly half a million student-athletes nationwide,” the NCAA wrote in the statement.
