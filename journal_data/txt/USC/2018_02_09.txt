The season is fully underway for the No. 2 women’s water polo team, which hits the road this weekend for the Triton Invitational. The San Diego tournament brings together 16 top-ranked teams from the California area, providing potentially four games of solid competition across two days.

The Trojans earned the top seed in a bracket including No. 13 UC Santa Barbara, No. 18 San Diego State and unranked Sonoma State. They will start tournament play against Sonoma State, a team that USC has never faced in program history. The Trojans have fared well so far this season against unranked opponents, demolishing Cal Baptist 20-0 and Pomona-Pitzer 21-3 two weeks ago, and the team carries confidence into the tourney opener.
“We’re still working on rotating in the younger players and giving everyone time to get comfortable as a unit,” senior captain Brianna Daboub said. “We’re still finding our rhythm and figuring out a lot of little parts of the game, so this weekend will be really good for us.”
If the Trojans win the opener, they’ll have one more matchup on Saturday and two more on Sunday. With 12 ranked teams in the tournament pool, those games could give the team the chance to play three more ranked opponents. However, the team’s sights are set at the end of the tournament, which offers a possibility to face off against UCLA in the final game. 
Although it’s only a possibility, any opportunity to face off against UCLA is a cause for excitement for the Trojans. In the history of collegiate water polo, only four teams have made it to the NCAA final — Stanford, Cal, USC and UCLA. The finals of the MPSF and NCAA tournament this year can be expected to come down between these four teams, and a chance at facing the Bruins early in the season will give the squad a chance to size up its competition.
The Bruins will be led by head coach Adam Wright, who enters his first year with the women’s team after earning accolades coaching the men’s side for UCLA. The Bruins also lost valuable seniors at the end of last season, but its younger players integrated effectively in a season opening victory over Loyola Marymount. The headliner of that young corps is sophomore Maddie Musselman, who Longan describes as a player who can make the difference between a win and a loss for any team.
“At any point in the season, [playing UCLA] is a good barometer for where we’re at as a team,” team captain and goalie Amanda Longan said. “We look forward to it, and I think it’s good because it gets us going and keeps us looking forward.”

Congressional Democrats have made clear their intention to pursue justice for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients with dauntless and relentless intention. Three weeks ago, they refused to buy into a bad bill that would leave DREAMers in limbo, their persistence and collective action going so far as to force the Republican-dominated government into a three-day shutdown. Democratic senators demanded — and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell eventually allowed — open debate on immigration legislation if a deal could not be reached by Thursday. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the 77-year-old minority leader of the House of Representatives, stood in four-inch heels and spoke continuously for eight hours and seven minutes, the longest marathon speech in House history, to force Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to make the same sort of commitment. If Democrats are looking for a cohesive ethos for their platform in 2020, well, here it is. This is the party whose near-octogenarian leader will stand in front of the nation, with the power of her civic conscience and whatever human endurance such convictions conferred, to stand up for DREAMers. 
After a shutdown and social media campaigns and an eight-hour historic feat of endurance, how much clearer could it be? When Republicans act on ideology — Texas senator Ted Cruz’s Green Eggs and Ham filibuster to shut the government down over the Affordable Care Act — they take prideful responsibility and their base appreciates it. And across the aisle, Democrats have, through these actions, made their agenda abundantly clear — to Republicans, to Trump, to the people. It’s time to own it. No, we will not compromise on toxic bills, we will not pander to nativism and we are perfectly willing to hold up the House for as many hours as necessary to protect the civil and human rights of our constituents, whether they are DREAMers or anyone else. Young Democrats here at USC and on all college campuses should demand that our Democratic representatives stop equivocating on the nature of the platform. Say it out loud. Nancy Pelosi would not yield — and neither will we. 
Moreover, three weeks ago when the last continuing resolution was passed after the three-day shutdown, it came with the added promise from McConnell that he would bring a bill to the floor that addressed the fate of the nearly 700,000 DREAMers still waiting for a clear answer. The American people have shown their desire to see this issue solved — be it through a continuation of the act, comprehensive immigration reform or some conservative alternative — some sort of change. But here we are, three weeks later. 
Now, whether or not McConnell will follow through — especially given his track record — will depend on the Democrats’ and centrist Republicans’ willingness to hold him to his commitment. In the House, however, Ryan made no such original commitment, despite being an integral part of the same leadership as McConnell and the president who backed McConnell’s compromise. 
According to multiple credible reports, Ryan is also not seeking reelection, though he has not yet announced a decision. So, to recap — a person who is not in line with the rest of his party’s leadership, who is very likely no longer answerable to the people, who commands immense power in the largest governing body in the United States and arguably the one most directly representative of the people’s intention, is directly betraying that intention in order to engage in what could be a final months-long exercise in borderline tyranny. He is furthering his own ideological legacy and pandering to a failing president instead of allowing American representatives to vote on American interests.
Let me make this clear — whether or not you support DACA, whether or not you support DREAMers, whether you want a wall, a ban, a bill or none of those things — our elected representatives, the ones we chose, cannot follow through on those desires unless Ryan lets them. And it looks like unless pressure mounts, he won’t. 
That is what Pelosi’s marathon speech was about. Democrats should own it — and if and when they do, we need to reward them for it. This, if anything, should foreshadow what a Democratic platform should look like heading into 2020. This is the party that, on the one hand, no longer feels the need to create for itself a false choice between supporting economic recalibration and ensuring social justice; but on a larger scale, no longer equivocates and compromises on its own platform, no longer skates around the strongest pieces of its message, no longer pretends not to be the party creating a future and opposing those who would push us back. Centrism and compromise are important still — they have their place. But our platform, our vision and our goals cannot be a statement of prevarication. I stand behind the spirit of Nancy Pelosi’s fearless audacity. You should, too.

Tragedy. If you watch enough USC basketball, you know the full meaning of the word. Weeks ago, the Trojans blew a 15-point lead to lose to Stanford on a half-court heave at the buzzer. It was only Saturday when the Trojans blew a nine-point lead with under 10 minutes to go at UCLA. Surely, they would not relive their late-game unworkings on Thursday night at Arizona State. Right? Wrong. In the fashion of Trojan tragedy, the Men of Troy blew a seven-point lead with 2:30 to play. Arizona won 80-78, finishing the game on a 9-0 run.
Senior guard Jordan McLaughlin was held to seven points in the Arizona State defeat. Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
As the Trojans (17-8, 8-4) flew to Tempe, Arizona, they knew that Thursday night’s game against the Arizona State Sun Devils would be crucial. Just one game behind the Arizona Wildcats for first place in the Pac-12, two wins this weekend would put them in sole possession of first place. Two losses could leave them in a tie for fifth. 
However, the Trojans sputtered out of the gate versus the Sun Devils (18-6, 6-6), scoring only nine points in the first 10 minutes. Uncharacteristically, guard Jordan McLaughlin turned the ball over three times in the opening minutes. Turnovers would plague USC throughout the game. They would commit 18, including two crucial ones in the final minutes.
Nevertheless, ASU did not capitalize on USC’s early errors. The Sun Devils, who average nine 3-point field goals per game, made one of nine in the first half. Thus, USC actually took the lead into the locker room, 37-33. Forwards Nick Rakocevic and Bennie Boatwright each had 12 points at the half.
In the second half, neither team broke free. Both started to shoot far better. In fact, it seemed as if ASU guard Shannon Evans could not miss. Actually, he had one crucial miss that will go unnoticed in history because he redeemed himself two possessions later. He finished with five 3-point field goals and 21 points, including the game-tying three with 49 seconds to play. He made it from way downtown.
But, USC had answers, too. Nick Rakocevic continued to score. He finished with a team-high 19 points. Guard Jonah Mathews added eight off the bench, all in the second half. 
Mathews, an elite defender, fouled out with 4:32 to play. Perhaps, if he had been in the game, Shannon Evans would not have made his late dagger.
Before Evans made that shot, though, the tide was turning toward the Sun Devils. After shrinking the lead to five with 2:06 to play, ASU Coach Bobby Hurley called a timeout. 
Out of the timeout, Boatwright literally scooped the ball to the other team while dribbling past half court. The turnover led to two wide open 3-point attempts for ASU’s best shooters — Evans and guard Tra Holder, who finished with a game-high 22 points. Both missed. Those misses, which should have nipped ASU’s momentum, ended up being inconsequential because Boatwright turned the ball over again. After grabbing the defensive rebound, Boatwright slid on the floor, traveling. ASU’s Kodi Justice made a 2-point shot on the ensuing possession. Then, USC failed to score, and the next time down the court, Evans tied the game.
With 0:31 to play, USC forward Chimezie Metu missed a layup, effectively leaving ASU the final possession of the game. Hurley elected not to take a timeout, trusting Holder to run a play. Indeed, Holder scored with 1.9 seconds left.
With no other option, USC head coach Andy Enfield called a timeout and drew up a baseball pass from Shaqquan Aaron on the baseline to Metu at the 3-point line. Metu bobbled the ball and volleyball punched it as time expired.
Exhausted and exasperated, Metu turned his jersey inside out and pulled it over his face.
That image encapsulates all of USC’s collective frustration. Last year, it was excusable for USC to blow late leads on the road in conference play. This year, it is not. The Trojans might be experienced, but at times, they lack savvy. Luck does not explain a pattern of blown leads late in games.
The silver lining for the Trojans is that UCLA beat Arizona, meaning they can still take control of the conference by beating the Wildcats on Saturday (if UCLA also loses). That said, a loss would put the Trojans at 8-5 in conference play and, according to ESPN’s Joe Lunardi, back on the outside of the NCAA Tournament bubble, looking inward. 
After the UCLA loss, No. 13 Arizona carries a 19-6 record. They got off to an impressive start to conference play, but have now dropped two Pac-12 games in a row. Star players guard Allonzo Trier (19.9 point per game) and top NBA Draft prospect forward Deandre Ayton (19.7 point per game) will look to solidify the Wildcats’ conference lead on Saturday in Tucson.

After two consecutive hard-fought losses at the hands of crosstown rivals UCLA, the Women of Troy will stay at home to host Arizona and Arizona State this weekend. USC currently has a 15-8 record, including 5-7 against Pac-12 opponents while Arizona has a 6-17 record with 2-10 against conference opponents and No. 25 Arizona State has a 17-7 record with an 8-4 conference record. 
Junior guard Aliyah Mazyck (center) put up a valiant effort against UCLA on Monday, scoring a game-high 21 points on 4-for-11 3-point shooting. Despite her efforts, USC fell to UCLA 70-84, marking two straight losses to the Bruins. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
“Our mindset is great,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We started out 0-3 and we went to 3-3, we lost two games and then we won two games, so I think the goal is to make .500 in the Pac-12 and go to the postseason tournament. I trust these kids. I’m very, very excited by what they’ve shown me this year.”
Arizona State will come to the Galen Center first on Friday night. The Sun Devils have powered to a strong  start despite losing one of their key players, guard Sabrina Haines to an ACL injury in December, due to the team’s balance and depth. Junior Kianna Ibis leads the Sun Devils with 13 points per game on efficient shooting percentages of 50 percent shooting, 41.9 percent from downtown and 80 percent from the line. Guards Courtney Ekmark and Robbi Ryan and forward Jamie Ruden shore up the scoring with averages of 10.1, 9.5 and 10.0, respectively, and all three players are capable shooters from deep. Center Charnea Johnson-Chapman leads the team in rebounding with 7.2 per game. With such balanced team members who know their roles and contribute equally, Arizona State poses a challenge for any team to play. 
“They play a very aggressive defense,” Trakh said. “They like to come out and pressure so we gotta handle their pressure and they run their sets really, really well, so we [have to] come out fresh and we have to defend their sets. I think that’s the main things: handle their man-to-man pressure, they’ll play 10 people, they’ll rotate every couple minutes so they like to keep their kids fresh. We’re not as deep, so that’s going to be where the challenge is going to pose in a 40-minute game.”
The other Arizona team will come on Sunday afternoon, but compared to the Sun Devils, the Wildcats have struggled this season. The Wildcats are led by guard JaLea Bennett with 14.6 points per game and Sam Thomas with 10 points and 7.8 rebounds. Guard Lucia Alonso and forward Kat Wright are both capable shooters, with Alonso notably averaging 42.7 percent from deep. However, the Wildcats are terribly inefficient as a team with 36.6 percent shooting overall, including 33.0 percent from 3-point range. The Wildcats are also similar to the Trojans in rebounding averages which could be a key focus in the matchup as the Wildcats will pit Thomas and forward Destiny Graham (6.6 rebounds per game) against Trojans senior forward Kristen Simon. However, USC should look to pick up a win on Sunday against the struggling Wildcats. 
“They just fight, in a year where they got a really great recruiting class coming in next year so I think they’re just loose and they’re playing hard and they’re well coached, so I think it’s a question of focus because they’re so capable of beating anyone in the conference,” Trakh said. 
Despite two losses against UCLA, the Trojans competed well in the two games and they hope that energy and effort will carry over into this weekend’s matchups. They were down early in both game, but USC fought back valiantly, cutting double-digit deficits to a fighting chance in both games before UCLA built their lead back up. The team’s relentless effort to climb back within distance of UCLA warranted praise from the Trojans’ head coach. 
“They played the No. 9 team in the country with probably the best point guard in the country and I felt the kids played a competitive game,” Trakh said. “It was an 8-point game in the fourth quarter at their place and it was a 1-point deficit with four minutes remaining at our place. Everybody we play, it’s been a competitive game and it’s a game where we had a chance to win it in the fourth quarter so I like that competitive spirit the kids have. They won’t give up, they’ll never think they’re out of the game.”
USC’s defense has been stifling so far this season as their zone defense has dramatically altered the pace of the game to be much slower, something that UCLA coach Cori Close admitted to be a factor in hampering UCLA’s high-pace offense. Another key pointer to watch for will be foul trouble as USC’s starters were peppered with fouls in its slugfest against UCLA, forcing Trakh to play the reserves while keeping its starters glued to the bench. As USC does not boast a deep bench, it has relied on heavy minutes from the starters for most, if not all, of their production on a nightly basis and the starters will have to be careful on the defensive end to avoid foul troubles.
“All year we’ve stayed out of foul trouble,” Trakh said. “So we gotta get back to basics: not fouling. We can’t afford to foul because of our lack of depth so we can’t foul. Our defense has been good at times and it’s also been suspect at times but it’s been good more than it’s been suspect. We just gotta regroup and get ready for the game.”
USC hosts Arizona State on Friday at 7 p.m. before playing Arizona on Sunday at 1 p.m. Both games can be streamed through USC’s live stream which can be found on the Pac-12 Network site.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
It was hard to think of a prettier sight as a Trojan fan, especially in the offseason. On Wednesday morning, Solomon Tuliaupupu — the third-ranked inside linebacker in this year’s high school class — sat in front of countless cameras and behind hats emblazoned with three different logos: Notre Dame, USC and UCLA.
“I will be attending the University of…”
Tuliaupupu milked every millisecond, glancing at the powder-blue cap and then extending his hand briefly toward the navy. He finally reached between them and placed the cap bearing the interlocking “SC” logo on his head.
“Southern California.”
Thus kicked off USC football’s 2018 National Signing Day. One hour later, the program reeled in an even bigger fish: five-star, second-ranked cornerback Olaijah Griffin. When the day was over, USC had secured several big names to add to an already formidable class.
This feels like an annual occurrence now. The Trojans beat out not only their archrivals, but also most of college football on the recruiting trail this year, finishing with the No. 4 class in the nation according to the 247Sports composite rankings. This is the program’s third top-five class in four years. USC has not finished lower than 10th since the infamous NCAA sanctions ended in 2014, and this year, head coach Clay Helton managed to assemble a class rated higher than Alabama’s.
Tuliaupupu wasn’t the headliner of the group — he wasn’t even the headliner from his own school. Over the course of the recruiting season, the Trojans signed four five-star recruits, including superstar quarterback-wide receiver combo JT Daniels and Amon-Ra St. Brown: Tuliaupupu’s former teammates at Mater Dei High School. Tuliaupupu may have been the No. 3 inside linebacker in the country, but USC also snagged top overall inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote. Of the Trojans’ 18 recruits in this year’s class, 11 were ranked top-10 nationally at their position.
With the debut of college football’s new early signing period this year, National Signing Day wasn’t as huge an ordeal as we may be used to, but when all was said and done, the Trojans had once again emerged as one of the biggest winners of the season. It’s cause for celebration, especially for a program that is losing significant talent to the NFL this spring.
But at some point, the on-paper victories on signing day will have to translate to success of equal stature on the field.
I voiced staunch support for Helton throughout a pressure-filled 2017 campaign, and my opinion hasn’t changed. The statement above isn’t some sort of indictment or ultimatum: It’s simple fact. Helton enters his third full season as USC’s head coach boasting yet another elite crop of freshmen and a lucrative contract extension through 2023. It was unreasonable to expect him to immediately take over the circus left in former head coach Steve Sarkisian’s wake in 2015 and establish the team as a national contender.
However, Helton has now had ample time to instill his philosophy and assemble the roster accordingly — and to his credit, he has done so with aplomb. This is an argument doubters are tired of hearing, but it’s simple fact: Helton is undefeated at the Coliseum as a head coach, and his first two seasons have yielded a Rose Bowl victory, and then a Pac-12 Championship. After another banner signing day, Helton has also assembled the deepest pool of talent on campus since USC’s glory days last decade.
With those successes in tow, it’s time for Helton to catapult USC into the national title discussion, not merely over the summer but come the new season, too. Even Nick Saban didn’t win his conference in his first two seasons with Alabama — but he did win it all in year three, defeating Texas in the 2010 BCS National Championship. In 2018, it will be Helton’s mission to do the same. It may seem unreasonable to compare Helton to arguably the greatest head coach in the history of college football, but if you asked him about it yourself, I think you might be surprised by his answer. This is USC. If this team refuses to compare itself to the likes of Alabama, it has already admitted defeat.
This isn’t about proving worthiness or championship mentality or any other cliche we like assigning to teams. This is simply about taking the next step at a program that still fancies itself a blueblood college football powerhouse. A conference title and a Rose Bowl ring — there’s only one logical achievement left to complete the trifecta.
