The Political Student Assembly and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a discussion focusing on Gov. Jerry Brown’s State of the State address, as well as the future of California policy.

Former California State Sen. Tony Strickland and former Assemblymember Anthony Portantino were in attendance, and praised Gov. Brown for his pragmatism in dealing with the state’s budget and other issues.
“Gov. Brown has established himself as an adult in the room, mainly by reigning in spending in Sacramento,” Portantino, a democrat, said. “He’s certainly keeping the left at bay, not a lot of new spending, not a lot of new taxes on top of Prop. 30 … I think he’s doing a very good job.”
Prop. 30 is a ballot measure passed by voters in Nov.  2012 that temporarily increased taxes to prevent a $6 billion cut in education funding.
Strickland, a republican and Congressional candidate, agreed that Gov. Brown was learning from the past and making prudent choices regarding the state’s financial future.
“[Gov. Brown] learned a lot from the mistakes of the past few governors,” Strickland said. “He hasn’t increased spending and he’s saved a lot of money for the rainy day fund.”
The talk then shifted toward policy prescriptions for California’s future. Strickland stressed the need for flatter tax rates and Portantino advocated for investment in education.
“What I think needs to happen is reform in the tax structure,” Strickland said. “We have these huge booms [in spending] when the economy is going well and then huge drops when it isn’t.”
Strickland also said that simplifying the tax code by eliminating confusing loopholes and deductions would create a more fair system in which the rich are not unfairly advantaged and everyone has “some skin in the game.” Doing so, he says, would prevent the boom-bust spending that is typical of California.
“You create this new program and tell voters, ‘Oh, enroll in this program’ and then two years later, you have to cut that same program,” Strickland said. “That’s not good policy.”
Portantino agreed that the polices of the late ’90s locked in spending at unsustainable levels, but he believes investment in education is key to restoring California’s prosperity.
“We’ve lost a lot of business because we’re not producing an educated workforce,” Portantino said. “We’re 3 million bachelor’s degrees short of meet the retiring generation.”
Portantino supported Gov. Brown’s decision to prioritize K-12 education.
“At a time when the economy demands we do more for our students, we are doing less,” he said.
The talk ended on a bipartisan note, with Strickland urging people to avoid obtaining information from only partisan sources.
“Elected officials are a snapshot of their electorate,” he said. “When people say they want compromise, what they’re really saying is they want you to agree with me.”
For many students the talk was informative and engaging.
“I agree that education reform is the most pressing issue facing California,” said Annie Wanless, a sophomore majoring in political science.“We have so many students who aren’t graduating.”
Others praised the bipartisanship.
“It was refreshing that a conservative republican was the one who said we needed to compromise,” said Luke Phillips, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “It’s always good to know that things are still civil.”

Dana and David Dornsife, longtime benefactors of the university, hosted an event Wednesday evening that discussed their experiences while traveling to rural villages in Africa. Hundreds of USC students, faculty and guests gathered at USC’s Town and Gown to hear about their philanthropic mission.
Humanitarians · Alumnus David Dornsife and wife Dana spoke on their partnership with World Vision regarding their experiences in Africa. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
Both Dornsifes have dedicated themselves to helping those less fortunate gain access to resources. With the cooperation of World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, the Dornsifes have made a striking difference in the villages they visited.
In 2009, the couple was providing clean water to about 2,000 people. Now, by using  up-to-date technology and with World Vision’s support, they supply valuable health practices to a new person every 30 seconds. Their work has provided water to more than 10 African countries, helping 4.5 million people. In 2014, the Dornsifes aim to aid another 1.4 million people.
The event began with an introduction of the couple by President C. L. Max Nikias.
Dana Dornsife informed the audience of the struggles many Africans face in regard to water, sanitation and hygiene: the three main components of their organization’s focus. The Dornsifes went on to explain the remarkable difference they’ve made for many of the villages in Africa and mentioned that their work helped a village build a well in one week, which would have taken the locals two years. The well provides an entire village with clean water.
The Dornsifes have also resolved to implement long-term solutions through their charity work.
“Sustainability, sustainability, sustainability — I cannot repeat this enough,” Dana Dornsife said. “Hopefully in five years we [will] have rural villages in Africa standing on their own two feet.”
Larissa Purnell, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said the Dornsifes’ presentation inspired her.
“It’s incredible what a huge impact an NGO can have on the world,” Purnell said. “As a business major, having speakers like Dana and David come to USC, it inspires [me] to pursue social entrepreneurship endeavors myself. It reinforces my passion.”
Many people in the audience shared Purnell’s view on the presentation. Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and vice dean for academics programs professor, said the Dornsifes were a positive influence on the USC community.
“Seeing the Dornsifes donate their own lives to make a difference in the world is incredible and should be an example for USC students,” Lamy said. “This is a ‘Fight On’ for something that matters.”
Sinjib Sato, a junior majoring in business administration, was shocked to learn how dilapidated the sanitation situation in Africa was.
“Learning that a child dies every 21 seconds from sanitation issues really resonates with you,” Sato said.
He also noted how people in the United States don’t often appreciate the value of basic amenities.
“Being at USC and in America, we take a lot of things for granted … You just don’t realize how bad things are,” Sato said.
David Dornsife noted there’s still work left to be done, and pointed out that anyone in the audience was capable of helping.
“The world needs a lot of work. So, if you want to help, you’re on, babe,” David Dornsife said.

On Wednesday afternoon, USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted the semester’s second installment of “Students Talk Back: A Politics and Public Policy Forum” in partnership with the USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Daily Trojan.
The theme for the week’s discussion was, “War on Poverty: 50 Years and Fighting.” The talk was moderated by Burke Gibson, chief copy editor of the Daily Trojan, and Kerstyn Olson, interim director of the Unruh Institute.
Panelists included Reed Galen, owner of Jedburghs, LLC and a former adjunct professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism; Angelica Solis, director of community development for the Youth Policy Institute and students Christian Patterson, a member of the USC College Democrats and Giuseppe Robalino, the director of Political Affairs and Strategy for the College Republicans.
The discussion began with the current state of the War on Poverty in Los Angeles, a city recently named one of five “Promise Zones” by President Barack Obama, implementing a program he outlined in the 2013 State of the Union Address.
Solis, however, said Los Angeles is not guaranteed any funding just because it was named a Promise Zone.
“There actually aren’t any funds attached to the Promise Zones,” she said. “The distinction to be very clear about is it is a designation — it provides [for] the city of L.A. to apply for competitive federal funding.”
The panelists then tackled the effectiveness of the War on Poverty as a whole. For Galen, who was a deputy campaign manager for the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain, the true measure of the War on Poverty’s success is not the idea behind it, but how that idea is implemented.
“The biggest failure is how many folks we have that live consistently below the poverty line and the intergenerational impact of that,” he said. “If there is an indictment, it is not the ideals behind it, it is the execution.”
Patterson agreed and spoke of the immense benefits that federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) and the Earned Income Tax Credit have had on families struggling to climb out of poverty.
Before opening the floor to questions from the audience, Olson asked the panel for comments on how democrats and republicans can compromise on the issue.
“Republicans must get over being indifferent to the plight of folks who live below the poverty line and being cavalier to the fact that people might starve the death,” Galen said. “If we’re going be the party of opportunity, we should be the party of opportunity for everybody — not [just] white families in the suburbs.”
Robalino agreed with Galen’s sentiments.
“This is an issue the Republican Party can come to own,” he said. “It hearkens back to Horatio Alger’s ideas on coming from rags to riches.”
Patterson, however, did not believe the Republican Party cared about the War on Poverty based on recent legislation the party has fought for.
“We should not think of the war on poverty as a Democrat issue or a Republican issue,” Patterson said. “I don’t think the Republican stance on the War on Poverty will be a hard pill to swallow for many people, given that the House just fought for months and months to cut $40 billion from food stamps.”
Students in attendance spoke of the importance of hearing the conversation from the viewpoint of students as well as professionals.
“It’s nice to hear both perspectives, people that are working in the field that we’re talking about and students that are politically involved coming from a different point of view in the classroom,” said Jennifer    Ann-Massey, president of the USC College Republicans.
Olson emphasized the ability of “Talk Backs” to showcase different opinions and views.
“I hope that they are provided a broad perspective,” Olson said. “Not just ideologically, but considering all of the social factors that contribute to poverty and thinking outside of their political leanings about how the other side has made attempts to or has been successful in preventing poverty in their districts.”
The next “Students Talk Back” is Feb. 26, and will cover California’s historic drought.

On Feb. 10, Undergraduate Student Government presidential and vice-presidential candidates James White and Brigid Kelly discussed their campaign on Platforum, a student-run political talk show broadcasted on Trojan Vision. The tickets of Logan Heley-A.J. Pinto and Andrew Menard-Rini Sampath were also scheduled to participate in the debate, but pulled out at the last minute, citing a potential conflict of interest concerning the moderator, Dan Morgan-Russell.
The tickets were not aware of Morgan-Russell’s position as moderator until Thursday, Feb. 6, vice presidential candidate and Daily Trojan online editor Rini Sampath said. After being told by multiple sources that Morgan-Russell, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business), was allegedly supporting one of the tickets, both the Heley-Pinto and Menard-Rini campaigns decided to request a new moderator the same day.
“I sent an email to Dan [Morgan-Russell] saying that to ensure fairness, I believe having someone [who is] removed from the voting process moderating the debate would be beneficial for all parties involved in this debate,” Heley said.
Morgan-Russell said that there was not enough time to find and train a replacement host, and gave both tickets his contact information to further discuss the matter.
“Trojan Vision decided to stick to their moderator, and we didn’t feel that was appropriate,” Menard said. “We believe that it is incredibly important to protect the integrity of journalism ethics, and that is having moderators who have a completely clean track record and who are completely unbiased.”
The two tickets did not further communicate with those organizing the event for Trojan Vision until Sunday afternoon, when Heley-Pinto and Menard-Rini informed the station by email that they would not be participating in the debate.
Though Heley and Menard said they only found out about the debate Thursday afternoon, Morgan-Russell said that he had spoken to the candidates over the phone weeks prior to that day.
“We told them over the phone weeks ago what the general format was and we sent the rules document that laid everything out piece-by-piece on Thursday [Feb.6],” Morgan-Russell said. “And it was only then that they brought up the issue that they wanted someone other than me hosting the debate. Before that, there had been no objections from any candidate.”
The two tickets’ apprehension stemmed from rumors circulating about Morgan-Russell’s involvement in campus politics.
“Dan [Morgan-Russell] has spoken out against [USG] before, very publicly,” Heley said. “He’s written [articles] in the Daily Trojan about salaries for USG members and that sort of thing and had a very clear opinion on those issues.”
Morgan-Russell is a former Daily Trojan staff writer and columnist who wrote about USG on two occasions. In the April 22, 2013 issue of the Daily Trojan, Morgan-Russell wrote an editorial in the opinion section titled “USG should focus on student funding.” Morgan-Russell later wrote a news article about salaries for USG officers called “USG salaries established as highest in Pac-12,” which ran on Oct. 9, 2013.
The Menard-Rini campaign also brought up the potential issue of Morgan-Russell’s friendship with Nathaniel Haas, the campaign manager of the White-Kelly ticket and Daily Trojan staff writer and columnist. Morgan-Russell said that as a professional, his friendship would never cloud his judgment. In addition, Haas refuted the claim that there could be potential bias due to his relationship with the Morgan-Russell.
“While I am close friends with Dan [Morgan-Russell], the White-Kelly campaign expected and was glad that as a moderator Dan [Morgan-Russell] displayed the highest degree of professional integrity,” Haas said. “Anyone who watched the debate will see that [Morgan-Russell] asked James [White] and Brigid [Kelly] difficult and thoughtful questions, and we are disappointed that our opponents chose not to engage with us in that discussion.”
Heley said that debates are conducive to any election and that his disagreement with the proposed debate was solely based on alleged bias of the moderator.
“As a journalist and as a candidate in this race, I’m all for having debates,” Heley said. “But I want to make sure that the person moderating the debate and the person in charge of the debate does not have any biases that they carry with them. I want someone who is objective leading those debates and I personally didn’t feel comfortable with the person that was moderating the debate based on what he has previously expressed his opinion publicly on.”
Morgan-Russell said he insisted to the candidates on Feb. 6 that he was qualified to moderate, citing his extensive experience as a debater in high school and his position as executive producer of Trojan Vision’s program Platforum.
“I’m very informed as the head of a debate television [show] here at Trojan Vision,” Morgan-Russell said. “I also have a lot of experience being on air, talking about these kinds of issues and being a host for Platforum. And before that, in high school, I was an accomplished debater, placing fourth in the nation talking about politics.”
Morgan-Russell also responded to Heley’s apprehensions about his active engagement in campus issues.
“The fact that I am involved and cognizant of the issues here at USC and willing to write about them and willing to voice my opinion means that I’m that much more qualified to be the moderator of this kind of debate, because I know what’s going on at USC,” Morgan-Russell said. “Logan Heley mistook my involvement on campus and my involvement as a student for bias.”
Following the departure of the Heley-Pinto and Menard-Rini tickets, Morgan-Russell said he scrambled to conceive a new format focusing on the candidacies of White-Kelly and Faiz Jaspar Abu-Jaber-Harrison James. Presidential write-in candidate Faiz Jaspar Abu-Jaber got into a car accident on the day of the event and did not attend.
Therefore the debate turned into an interview, with Morgan-Russell asking the White-Kelly ticket about their platform as well as the platforms of the other candidates.
White took the opportunity to explain his motivations for running.
“For me, this campaign is particularly important because I don’t fit the traditional mold of what the USC USG president is,” White said. “I am not in a Greek organization, amongst other things. And I’m really just trying to pave a path for those leaders, those amazing leaders, those amazingly capable people that want to be in this position.”
Morgan-Russell also asked the White-Kelly ticket about the feasibility of their opponents’ campaign promises, including    Heley-Pinto’s proposed renovation of Lyon Center and Menard-Sampath’s initiative to expand tuition coverage from 18 to 20 units. White stated that he and his running mate could accomplish realistic change, largely because of their access to multiple resources on campus.
After the broadcast, Morgan-Russell formally endorsed the White-Kelly candidacy on his personal Facebook page. Morgan-Russell said that he was not originally planning on publicly endorsing a candidate but his sentiments changed following the departure of the Menard-Rini and Heley-Pinto tickets. Morgan-Russell’s status prompted responses from both campaigns.
When asked about the controversy surrounding Morgan-Russell’s alleged bias on Tuesday, Abu-Jaber  said that he was disappointed that not all of the candidates seized the opportunity to discuss their respective platforms.
“Honestly, I just don’t agree with their decision not to go,” Abu-Jaber said. “I think there’s a lot of rhetoric of ‘is it fair, is it not fair,’ but I think the even bigger thing behind it was that both tickets thought it would be something easy to get out of and have a couple hours free. I think that’s what it came down to. And they had this nice excuse that ‘Well, I think [Morgan-Russell] is a friend of James White, so maybe I won’t go.’”
Abu-Jaber also said that he felt content with the format of the debate that was presented as well as   Morgan-Russell’s involvement as moderator.
“I felt comfortable [going into it] for a couple of reasons,” Abu-Jaber said. “First of all, I don’t know Dan [Morgan-Russell] super well, so maybe I’m wrong, but [he] seems like a pretty legit person, pretty honorable … If it becomes apparent that he’s extremely biased toward one of the people who’s on stage, it would really hurt his career. So it honestly just wouldn’t make sense for him to make people look bad and call them out, because in the end it would be worse for him than for them.”
Presidential candidate James White agreed with Abu-Jaber’s sentiments, saying that the Trojan Vision debate would have been an outlet for all of the tickets to further their messages to the student body.
“I think it was a missed opportunity and missed airtime for the other candidates,” White said. “The more student organizations that want to take a legitimate part in the election process, the better, because voting turnout is already very low. So participating in the debate would’ve given all the candidates the opportunity to tap into a group of students that they could not reach otherwise. I definitely think a debate with all four candidates would’ve been more beneficial than just a discussion with James White and Brigid Kelly.”
Morgan-Russell has stood by his decision to remain as moderator, saying that the program was intended to help get out the message of the USG candidates.
“As I told the campaigns, the whole idea of this was to educate the electorate,” Morgan-Russell said. “It was to make it so that USC students were better informed on the issues.”
Morgan-Russell also said that he was willing to have the tickets on Trojan Vision in the future.
“If the candidates are looking to come on and talk to us now about USC, USG issues now, after the election, after the inauguration, my door is always open,” Morgan-Russell said.
Olivia Diamond, senior communications director for USG, said the scheduled debate was not affiliated with USG in any way.
“On behalf of USG, the only required events were the meet and greet on Tuesday [Feb. 4] and the presidential and vice-presidential debate on Wednesday [Feb. 5] of last week,” Diamond said. “[The candidates are] also required to attend a couple of mandatory candidate meetings and submit all their paperwork, but as far as any other interviews or stories, or even the Daily Trojan optional supplement, it’s completely up to the candidates, and we let them know that from the beginning, so this debate was not associated or applicable to USG but we encourage all candidates to be cordial, and we encourage them to get their platforms out there because that’s the whole point. We want people to understand why they’re running, and we want that to be in as many different publications and as many different venues as possible.”

Sounds like Morgan-Russell is critical not biased.  I guess the candidates wanted to avoid hard questions.
This article and the appalling behavior of Morgan makes me sure that I will be voting for anyone BUT Menard-Rini and Heley-Pinto tomorrow. I cannot believe anyone would conduct themselves in such a manner and claim to be so unbiased. This entire situation is ludicrous. Good luck to the other candidates.
Dan Morgan-Russell clearly did nothing wrong. How very silly of the other candidates not to show up. Alas, however, the Greek organization’s GOTV network will almost undoubtedly mean that two other suited nonentities win this thing to burnish a resume and accomplish nothing that affects the vast majority of normal students.
This article and the appalling behavior of Heley-Pinto and Menard-Rini makes me sure that I will be voting for anyone BUT Heley-Pinto or Menard-Rini tomorrow. I cannot believe that anyone would conduct themselves in such a manner and claim Morgan-Russell to be so biased. This entire situation is ludicrous. Good luck to the other candidates.
Vote for Menard-Rini for President/VP! They are the most qualified and most balanced ticket. They are what USG needs moving forward.
Who decided to let Dan MR moderate this debate? He’s numerous times expressed a clear prejudice against USG, and is hardly a reliable, much less unbiased, source of information.
This article and the appalling behavior of Morgan makes me sure that I will be voting for anyone BUT White-Kelly tomorrow. I cannot believe anyone would conduct themselves in such a manner and claim to be so unbiased. This entire situation is ludicrous. Good luck to the other candidates.

USC’s Gate 6 closed Wednesday morning after a man injured in an off-campus shooting drove to the entrance.
The shooting is considered non-USC related, Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said. LAPD Detective Mike Lorenz told the Daily Trojan that the shooting took place south of campus.
“We aren’t sure if it was [a] car to car [shooting] for right now but we’re still interviewing witnesses,” Lorenz said. “Apparently a vehicle came north that was involved in it and … the person that was in the car got hit several times and was transported to the hospital.”
A fifth Trojan Alert sent out to the USC community at 12:50 p.m. said the area had been cleared.

Pete Carroll, former USC head football coach and current head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, will return to USC Wednesday, Feb. 26 from 6 to 8 p.m. to discuss his new book, Win Forever, at Bovard Auditorium, according to Asher Genoot, assistant director of Elections and Recruitment for Undergraduate Student Government.
Carroll was the head coach of the Trojan football team from 2001 to 2010. During his tenure, the USC football team won two national championships, though one was later discounted due to NCAA violations. Carroll left the school in 2010 and began coaching in the NFL as the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks later that year. This past season, Carroll led the Seattle Seahawks to their first Superbowl win.
A limited amount of tickets to the event, organized by Dave Belasco, the co-director of The Lloyd Grief Center of Entrepreneurial Studies, will be raffled off by USG. Students who vote in the USG elections are eligible to take part in the raffle. Voting for USG elections ends Thursday evening at 8 p.m. Undergraduate students can vote on campus in five locations: the Lyon Center, the John McKay Center, Ronald Tutor Hall, Tommy Trojan and Trousdale Parkway outside of the Von KleinSmid Center between 10:00 a.m. and 4 p.m. Students can also vote online at elections.usc.edu until 8 p.m. Thursday night.

Ever since director Zack Snyder hinted that his upcoming Man of Steel sequel, still tentatively titled Batman vs. Superman, would serve as a direct lead-in to the long-rumored Justice League movie, fans have accused Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment of rushing things in order to replicate the phenomenal crossover success of Marvel’s The Avengers. Others have lambasted DC for allowing its rival to take the lead in the first place, citing the abysmal Green Lantern and other failed attempts to expand its stable of heroes beyond Batman and Superman as proof that Marvel’s meticulous world-building model can’t be topped.
A League of Their Own · Batman, voiced by Jason O’Mara, and his fellow superheroes must unite against interdimensional tyrant Darkseid, voiced by Steve Blum in Justice League: War. – Photo courtesy of Warner Bros.
Both of those criticisms are perfectly valid, so long as we’re talking about live-action films. With the exception of Christopher Nolan’s groundbreaking Dark Knight trilogy, DC has struggled to match Marvel’s glib, fanciful energy and its ability to create an intricate yet accessible “shared universe.” Yet the exact opposite holds true for the field of animation, where DC has been dominating its old foe for more than two decades.
While Marvel Animation seems content to cater mainly to younger fans with programs such as Disney XD’s Ultimate Spider-Man and The Super Hero Squad Show, the DC animated universe offers everything from Bruce Timm and Paul Dini’s highly influential Batman: The Animated Series and Justice League to stunning feature-length adaptations of Frank Miller’s classic The Dark Knight Returns and Geoff Johns’ acclaimed Flashpoint storyline.
For years, one of the only major complaints about DC animation was its lack of a single unified line of continuity. That changed last week with the release of Justice League: War, the newest installment of the ongoing DC Universe Animated Original Movie series and the first to be set within DC Comics’ still-controversial “New 52” continuity, a rebooted timeline designed to streamline decades of cluttered narratives and draw in a new generation of readers.
Based on the first run of Geoff Johns and Jim Lee’s Justice League: Origin comic — the same series that launched the “New 52” back in Fall 2011 — Jay Oliva’s film follows Batman (Jason O’Mara) as he encounters Superman (Firefly’s Alan Tudyk) and the Green Lantern (Justin Kirk) for the first time while hunting down a cabal of interdimensional kidnappers in the employ of the evil deity Darkseid, played by voice-over maestro Steve Blum. The ensuing battle between the superheroes and Darkseid’s legion of “Parademons” ultimately leads to the formation of the Justice League, including founding members Wonder Woman (Michelle Monaghan), The Flash (Christopher Gorham), Cyborg (Shemar Moore) and Shazam (The Lord of the Rings’ Sean Astin).
Producer James Tucker recently announced that DC intends to release three straight-to-DVD animated features every year. Two of them will take place within the same continuity and the third will either be an original story with DC characters or an adaptation of a pre-existing work. Some adaptations will be brought into the new continuity, including this May’s Son of Batman, which takes Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert’s celebrated 2006 graphic novel Batman and Son and repurposes it as the follow-up to Justice League: War. Another upcoming project, this fall’s Batman: Assault on Arkham, will apparently take place within the world of the massively popular Arkham Asylum video games.
Son of Batman, directed by Avatar: The Last Airbender veteran Ethan Spaulding, is shaping up to be the most exciting of DC’s 2014 releases for a number of reasons. First of all, it will feature the animated debut of Damian Wayne, Batman’s fourth Robin and the genetically perfected offspring of Bruce Wayne and supervillainess Talia al Ghul. Despite being a relatively recent addition to the Bat family, this caustic, pint-sized assassin became an immediate fan favorite in the comics, and the outcry over his death in the pages of Morrison’s Batman, Inc. made international headlines last year.
If the idea of Batman discovering that he has a 10-year-old son who’s been trained to kill from birth by the League of Assassins fails to pique your interest, you might want to consider turning in your geek card. The film also boasts a surprisingly high-caliber voice cast, including the great Giancarlo Esposito as immortal arch-criminal Ra’s al Ghul. Esposito might have been talked into pursuing the role by his Breaking Bad co-star Bryan Cranston, who gave an excellent performance as then-Lieutenant Jim Gordon in 2011’s Batman: Year One.
While its animation team busies itself with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new projects, DC is also making significant inroads with other mediums, including live-action TV. The CW’s Arrow has proven itself a surprise hit with an increasingly rabid fanbase — giving the series a distinct advantage over Marvel’s disappointing Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC — and shows based on The Flash, obscure do-gooder Hourman, chain-smoking occult detective John Constantine and Jim Gordon’s early years as a Gotham City detective are already in development. The superhero craze has officially expanded to the small screen and VOD markets, and DC is taking the lead at a pace worthy of the Scarlet Speedster himself.
 
While EMH was a good show storywise, the animation was awful and very low budget (to the point that characters were off model or missing limbs and had glaring coloring errors in some scenes).  Besides Marvel cancelled EMH for Avengers Assemble, a show which is inferior in the writing department and even worse in animation (there are scenes where the characters look like they are carboard standees in motion and a lot of lazy computer generated scenes).
Ultimate Spider-Man and Wolverine and The X-Men is probably the only Marvel cartoon that I can think of that had decent animation and even then Ultimate Spider-Man’s quality has significantly gone down.
And even with the cancellation of those shows (which was more the fault of Cartoon Network exec than DC’s) DC still dominating the animation market with the Direct to DVD stuff (which is selling really well) and they show some of those movies in CN so they do reach wider demographics as well.
Not to mention the DC Nation shorts, they were a thing of beauty
Excuse me, you seem to have forgotten to acknowledge the cancellation of “Young Justice” and “Green Lantern TAS” not to mention the uncertain future of “Beware the Batman”. Marvel can do animated shows that skew a wider demographic. “Avengers: EMH”  and a few of it’s “X-men” series spring to mind. Marvel might be squandering talent there but at least it’s doing stuff with it’s characters. DC on the other is practically dissmising all of it’s efforts for the sake of focusing all it’s creative input into TTgo! Kindly explain that!

Have you ever wanted to fly to another country, or maybe even another planet? It might seem out of reach, but for a child in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy, fantasy feels like the farthest thing in the world.
But the on-campus Flying Mollusk World Jam, which begins Friday and runs through the end of the weekend, is attempting to fix that. The event fosters collaboration between developers to create visual worlds that help ease the procedural and chronic pain of kids and teens undergoing medical treatment.
“The purpose behind this event is to get together a lot of people from different backgrounds,” said Marientina Gotsis, director of the Creative Media & Behavioral Health Center. “We imagine most of them will probably be artists and programmers to develop a virtual world that can be used by patients at Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles. In this particular Jam, we’re not necessarily expecting that people will make games, or they might, but we’re looking for very interesting places that you can experience. We’re in need of an environment that people can use for 5-15 minutes in order to not focus on painful procedures that they’re going through.”
USC students with both technical and creative skills will work as the developers, as well as collaborate with Flying Mollusk — the producer of the event — and graduates who are now in the industry are able to guide students with less experience through the process.
“Groups of people come together organically, and they sort of coalesce on the concept they want to explore,” Gotsis said. “Some of them may come in ready to make something someone else wants, and others might have an idea and they’re looking to pitch other people to make their idea happen.”
Friday will serve as an introduction to the event, with guest speaker Dr. Jeffrey Gold from the hospital, where teams can mix and mingle and toss around some preliminary ideas. Teams will then work all day Saturday, a half-day Sunday and unveil their creations Sunday evening.
The second phase of the philanthropic project will involve visiting the Children’s Hospital and meeting with patients and doctors one on one.
“We’ll figure out when [the games] are appropriate for different types of procedures and get feedback,” Gotsis said. “Hopefully this will create a first cycle that we can repeat so that we can do this more frequently and get to a point where we can get the patients to submit a wish, like, ‘I would like to have this.’ Maybe in the next cycle someone will actually choose to make it.”
Though Gotsis said that the technology is already there to support such innovations, it isn’t being taken advantage of.
“There’s really very little, in this case, that’s used for pediatric patients,” Gotsis said. “At this point in time, the technology is really available and easy to use … It doesn’t take too much to make, and [patients] could sure use a lot of variety … It’s not that experimental. It’s off the shelf. But it hasn’t been used to this purpose, on the DIY scale.”
The concept of jams is also something that has been around for some time, gaining popularity with game jams, 48-hour film festivals, 24-hour theater challenges and other similar events that spur creative expression in high-energy, quick turnaround periods.
“We’ve done many, many game jams, so this is modeled after the traditional global game jam, which is truly global,” Gotsis said. “It happens all over the world … lots of gamers come together and make stuff together.”
Yet this upcoming World Jam is the first of its kind, with the trend taking a turn toward the benevolent and recently focusing on making a social impact or raising awareness for a cause.
“Two months ago, we had an LGBTQ one that was created,” Gotsis said. “So now we’re branching off of that and saying, ‘OK, why don’t we expand it and do something very specific for the mission that we serve?’ When I say ‘we,’ I’m talking about the Creative Media & Behavioral Health Center, and my collaborators at Children’s Hospital.”
Gotsis said she emphasizes the fact that she wants students to get excited about doing something with a specific purpose that’s not for a class or a job.
“It’s doing things for other people, and creating places for other people to experience,” Gotsis said. “It’s not just games — it’s fictional worlds. What if there was a place that you wanted to go that you could never go to … either for financial or health reasons?”
Gotsis said she is interested in targeting students who are pursuing a path in medicine, as the endeavor is as much a form of healing as it is a techie creation
“This is also something that we hope to generate more interest in from a lot of students who may be interested in integrative medicine,” Gotsis said. “A lot of people may think it’s a distraction, but it can be a very transformative experience. It’s not about forgetting the pain — it’s about transforming it into something else.”
As for what the future  holds for World Jam, Gotsis said she remains optimistic.
“It would be nice if one day, we have a World Jam that is actually global,” Gotsis said. “We have multiple groups of people in multiple locations all making virtual worlds and virtual environments for this purpose, for people who are in a medical setting, for patients who need to get their minds off whatever is happening and rethink their perspective and feel good and feel better.”

Tomorrow, USC baseball begins its 125th season of play. Under the lights at Dedeaux Field, junior Wyatt Strahan will throw the first pitch of the season against the Northwestern Wildcats at 6 p.m., and few at this school will care.
For roughly the last decade, baseball season has not meant much in the grand scheme of USC athletics — the program has had just one winning season since 2002, and that was way back in 2005. It’s a far cry from the glory days of USC baseball, which lasted for, oh, just 60 years or so. From the 1940s through the turn of the century, USC was the unquestioned king of college baseball, amassing an unmatched 12 National Championships.
But of the nearly 1,700 losses USC baseball has suffered in its 124 years of play, close to a fifth have come in the last decade. Last year the Trojans lost more games (36) than any USC team since the 1985 squad went 22-44.
This year, however, there is renewed optimism around the program. Two unnamed Pac-12 coaches told Perfect Game USA’s Kendall Rogers that USC would be the “surprise of the league.” Aaron Fitt of Baseball America said he spoke with several scouts who believe USC baseball will make a regional this year.
“I think [the new optimism] is absolutely warranted,” Fitt said. “Scouts I spoke with this fall said they haven’t seen a USC team play with this much energy in a long time.”
Fitt himself also sees USC as a regional team this year, and actually gives them a chance to win a regional next year.
“The future is bright,” Fitt said. “[Second-year head coach Dan Hubbs] was the right hire, and I think he’s got a great vision for how to restore this program to glory.”
One of the key reasons for USC’s heightened expectations is experience. Despite last season’s struggles, the raw talent on the roster was evident. As Hubbs often points out, despite their disappointing record, the Trojans rarely got blown out in 2013. Instead, they were more often just out-executed. And their youth certainly played into that.
“We were younger last year than anyone I’ve ever seen in our league,” Hubbs said. “I would compare it [to] when Oregon started [its program in 2009].”
Hubbs expects that experience to pay off, especially when it comes to late-game execution. The Trojans were woefully inept last year at doing the “little things” — like moving a runner over with a productive out or not giving up free bases on defense — all critical for a team that does not have the pure talent of some of the Pac-12’s elite.
USC has built a solid foundation. But the key to that foundation is not just in experience; it’s in roster depth.
“We should be deeper [on the mound, specifically] than we’ve ever been since I’ve been here,” said Hubbs, who joined the Trojans as a pitching coach in 2011. “Arm strength-wise, competitive-wise, pitchability-wise, we’re deeper. Which can only mean better. I don’t think we’ll be having a heart attack every game in the 7th inning.”
Hubbs had a number of terms to describe the Trojans’ comically unpredictable bullpen last season, my personal favorite being that picking relievers was “like flipping a coin.” But in my preseason meeting with him, he gave me a new favorite.
“There was a couple of weeks where I’d basically pick whoever pitched worse the day before, because it meant he’d pitch good today,” Hubbs said. “And if you pitch the guy who struck out the side the day before, he was gonna give up five runs.”
Pitching is without question where USC looks most improved this season. For example, the Trojans are expecting to have a set midweek starter, something they never came close to achieving in my three previous seasons covering the team. In fact, former head coach Frank Cruz actually let me pick the Tuesday starter a few times — that’s how much of a crapshoot it was.
“USC should be better in every phase of the game,” Rogers said. “But even if they improve a lot, the Pac-12 is strong enough that they could still finish 7th or 8th in the league.”
Despite the new confidence, in this year’s preseason poll Pac-12 coaches picked USC to repeat its 9th-place finish from 2013. And though I didn’t get the chance to ask Hubbs about that specifically, I am willing to speculate he would not find that unfair.
“The guys are believing that [they’re a regional team] right now, and that’s a great place to start,” Hubbs said. “But we have to go do it … You say you wanna be that, then we need to go make that happen.”
I have covered almost every USC home game over the last three years. As a consequence, I have been subjected to some very, very bad baseball. I’m not saying USC has no chance this year, but I want to see some results before I believe the hype.
“It’s nice that people are saying nice things about us,” Hubbs said. “But we haven’t don’t anything yet. I’m excited about the possibility of it, but we haven’t done anything yet.”
The chance to do that starts tomorrow.

Interesting that one person said Hubbs was the right hire. Then why did AD Pat Haden try to buy the
coach from ucla, John Savage for an outrageous sum of $1Million in the off season? That is showing
real confidence in your original hire.
Great writing! I can’t believe Frank Cruz let you, someone unaffiliated with the team, pick starting pitchers. That’s so pathetic.
Some hilarious quotes from Dan Hubbs! Keep up the good work, Nick, and fight on, SC baseball.

After an up-and-down home stand in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play last week, the USC men’s volleyball team will get another big chance to assert itself in the MPSF on the road with a matchup at UC Irvine today. The Trojans (6-4, 5-4 MPSF) pulled off a dramatic comeback five-set win against UC Santa Barbara (6-3, 5-3) last Thursday before they were swept by UCLA (10-2, 7-1) on Sunday in three sets before today’s bout against the Anteaters.
You dig? · Senior libero Henry Cassiday tallied 15 digs — a team high — in last month’s narrow win over UC Irvine at the Galen Center. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
Against UCSB, the Trojans came in as the home favorites as the fifth-ranked team in the nation, while the Gauchos were ranked eighth. USC lost the first set 25-20 and nearly lost the second set on several occasions before pulling out a nerve-racking 34-32 win.
The Trojans proceeded to lose the third set 25-23 and found themselves down 24-21 in the fourth set before storming back to win 27-25. They then clinched the decisive fifth set 15-9 to escape with a victory.
“This was huge,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said after the match. “Not only in the standings, but it was huge for our team psyche to be able to battle back, get a couple breaks and take advantage of it. This one’s a really big match in the scope of things.”
Despite a packed crowd filling much of the Galen Center on Sunday and plenty of momentum from the game before, the Trojans were unable to keep their winning ways going against the No. 2 UCLA Bruins, then the top-ranked team in the country by the AVCA and the first overall team in MPSF standings.
USC senior libero Henry Cassiday noted after the game that the Trojans made far too many errors to compete against a very strong Bruin team, particularly in passing and serving. The Trojans had 12 serving errors in addition to seven receiving errors.
“The passing and serving game are the biggest things in volleyball,” Cassiday said.
In both games last week, senior opposite hitter Tanner Jansen and redshirt junior outside hitter Joey Booth were featured prominently in the rotation. Booth was out with an injury all season until the UCSB match, but may have earned a starting spot alongside freshman Lucas Yoder at the outside hitter spot, though sophomore Alex Slaught got the majority of the starts at the second outside spot while Booth was hurt.
Jansen has split playing time at opposite with junior Cristian Rivera and senior Maddison McKibbin for most of the year so far, but Jansen might start receiving noticeably more playing time at the position after his breakout performance in the game against UCSB.
UC Irvine (7-7, 4-6) comes into today’s matchup as both the No. 9-ranked team in the AVCA  and ninth in the MPSF standings, whereas the Trojans come into this week as the No. 5-ranked team in the country and seventh in the conference.
“They’re always good and well-coached,” Cassiday said of the Anteaters. “They’ll come out with strong pins, good servers and good passers, so we always have to be ready for that.”
UC Irvine is the two-time defending national champion in the sport, having beaten USC at the Galen Center in the national title game two years ago. The Trojans defeated UC Irvine earlier this year at the Galen Center on Jan. 14 in similar dramatic  fashion to their victory against the Gauchos, coming back from a 2-1 set deficit to win in five.
“Our two programs have been battling for years now, and it’s always a good night of volleyball when our two teams play,” Ferguson said after the victory.
In that match, USC’s dynamic pair of freshmen — Yoder and middle blocker Andy Benesh — combined for 36 kills to carry the Trojans. Benesh was especially crucial to the team’s effort, recording 15 kills on 19 attempts without any errors.
It might be harder this time around for USC to come away with a win since the match will take place on the Anteaters’ home court, but the Trojans appear ready to embrace the raucous road environment.
“We always have fun going down there and playing there,” Booth said. “It’s a good environment and we’re excited about it.”
After playing in Irvine tonight, the Trojans will continue on south to UC San Diego for a match against the winless Tritons (0-11, 0-10) on Friday night.
USC swept UC San Diego last month –— a common result for the hapless Tritons, who have claimed only three sets in 11 matches so far this season. This might be attributed to the fact that the squad has only had the advantage of hosting two matches at home, though.
Both of the Trojans’ matches will begin at 7 p.m.

Following the disheartening loss to crosstown rival UCLA, the USC men’s basketball team (10-13, 1-9 Pac-12) will host the Utah Utes (16-7, 5-6) today with hopes of getting their elusive second conference win and halting their current four-game snide.
Shining example · Senior guard Pe’Shon Howard led the Trojans with 16 points, including perfect marks from the three-point and free-throw line, in USC’s 84-66 loss to Utah last month. Howard averages 10.5 points per game. – Jojo Korsh | Daily Trojan
 
USC made a visit to Salt Lake City earlier in the season and walked out the losers by a score of 84-66. The Utes controlled the game the whole way, but, like most games for the Trojans, USC fought to stay within striking distance before eventually biting the dust.
In that contest, the Trojans struggled to contain Utes guard Delon Wright, as the Los Angeles native dropped 22 points.
“Delon Wright really put us in a bind,” said USC head coach Andy Enfield after the game. “He drove the ball really well — got to the foul line 11 times.”
In general, it seemed to most that the better team won that contest.
“I thought Utah played a good game,” Enfield said.
The Utes are not necessarily one of the elite teams in the Pac-12, but the Trojans have no right to overlook any given team. The excitement that surrounded Enfield and his squad coming into this campaign quickly turned into embarrassment when conference play began.
The Trojans’ 1-9 mark in Pac-12 play is one of the worst in recent memory. Enfield will be given a few seasons to bring in the type of players that fit his run-and-gun system, but he certainly did not want to start off his tenure in Troy like this.
In spite of all this failure, one of the surprising qualities that has defined these Trojans is their ability to continue playing hard. The on-court product has been abysmal at times, but no one watching a USC basketball game this season has seen the apathy that plagued the Trojans during the Kevin O’Neill era.
Enfield, for his part, is continuing to see the silver lining in his team’s play, continuing to find signs of progress.
“We’ve improved defensively,” Enfield added. “The last four games, we held opponents to 40 percent shooting.”
Freshman phenom Nikola Jovanovic has been a big help in that category, and he too is choosing to remain positive and look forward to the next game.
“When we do everything that Coach says in the locker room, we play real well,” the Belgrade, Serbia native said.
Jovanovic’s early success is a good sign for the future of the program, proving that there is a light at the end of the USC basketball tunnel. But that light probably won’t shine for another couple of years.
“Everyone wants to see our men’s basketball program be successful,” said USC Athletic Director Pat Haden of the team’s progress. “But it’s not going to happen overnight.”
Fans can look forward to that success in the future. For now, they’ll settle for a simple win at the Galen Center tonight.

When Congress concluded the last session of 2013 with the passage of a budget, lightning struck once. It was a sign that the government was ready to move forward with common sense funding at regular intervals, a stark contrast to the last three years of stop-gap budget measures that created calamitous debates about government shutting down and culminated in the 16-day partial shutdown in October. In the final hours of Oct. 16, Congress put that debate to rest.
Design by Mollie Berg
In the final hours of Feb. 12, however, lightning struck twice.
Yesterday, under the careful shepherding of Speaker of the House John Boehner, Republicans allowed passage of a law that would raise the nation’s debt ceiling through 2015. Twenty-eight Republicans joined 193 Democrats to send the bill to the Senate. That same day, Republican leaders joined Democrats in voting for the bill’s advancement to a final vote, where they promptly voted against it, meaning the bill was sent to Obama’s desk on a 55-43 party line vote.
Beggars can’t be choosers. The messy fashion in which the Senate passed the bill — avoiding a last-minute filibuster by Senator Ted Cruz and the Tea Party wild bunch — is a testament that there are things to work on in Congress. But the raising of the debt ceiling is the most significant thing the 113th Congress has done — not because of what it accomplished, but how it was completed.
Perhaps there’s no better place to begin than Boehner’s words following his decision to allow the bill to pass in the House.
“When you don’t have 218 votes, you have nothing,” he said in a statement.
Read that again. For a man whose party has frivolously voted more than 40 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has allowed a government to shut down, Tuesday’s statement is a praise- worthy turnaround. Here, Boehner unapologetically admits that nothing can be gained from a sub-majority faction of voters who can accomplish nothing but government stalemate.
Pessimists on the left will dismiss Boehner’s move as nothing more than a political calculation — they will assert that with a midterm election coming, Boehner’s decision amounts to nothing more than a political one, and that come next January, the Republicans will be singing the same old tune.
But in fact, the mainstream Republican Party might actually be learning something, particularly that fiscal negotiations are not the place to exact concessions from the Democrats, especially given the political backlash they inspire. The argument above, however, breaks down when the variable of the Tea Party is introduced.
If Boehner’s move were merely a political calculation, he never would have made it. Allowing the debt-ceiling bill to sail through ruffled the feathers of nearly every tea bagger in the House and Senate, some of whom called for Boehner to step down as Speaker of the House. And yet in the face of 199 Republicans who voted against the bill, Boehner voted for its passage.
Passing the clean debt-ceiling bill is a brilliant reality check for the Tea Party. In the span of just two months, it is a sign that the mainstream Republican Party, after being thumped in two consecutive presidential elections, failing to oppose Obamacare and being blamed for the shutdown of the government, is trying to move forward, with Boehner at the helm.
The problem for the Republicans is that “mainstream” does not mean “majority.” Though it’s remarkable that Boehner would side with just 28 Republicans to pass the legislation, it’s a bad sign for the future of the party. Even old time leaders such as John McCain recognize the need for the party to adapt to changing U.S. sentiments.
“The American people overwhelmingly rejected the shutdown of the government,” McCain said in a statement, pointing to polls that showed Republicans took the bulk of the blame. “Americans don’t like government, but they don’t want it shut down. It was an object lesson for Republicans.”
How many Republicans learned that lesson? Not many, but Boehner appears to be one of them. In short, Boehner is ahead of the curve, and voting for a raise in the debt ceiling demonstrates his political common sense is evolving at a rate that far exceeds the rest of the Republican Party. It’s up to them to catch up — their political relevance depends on it.

The raising of the debt ceiling is only a signal that the USA has a bigger credit card. It does nothing to solve any actual problems – least of all the overspending problem. Did you know that more than 22% of the federal budget is spent paying interest on the federal debt? Does that sound like the USA doesn’t have enough credit?
I am glad I stook a stand against the crazy tea baggers!

Love is in the air this week for everyone except Yair Netanyahu.
Reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s 23-year-old son, Yair Netanyahu, is dating non-Jewish Norwegian Sandra Leikanger started a media frenzy last week, according to BBC. Though Prime Minister Netanyahu’s bureau dismissed accusations of the alleged relationship, insisting that the two students studying at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya are nothing more than college classmates, it was not enough to prevent many in the Israeli government from condemning the relationship.  The issue of whom Yair Netanyahu does or does not date, however, should be of no concern to anyone — especially Israel’s public leaders.
Many Israeli Knesset members were also part of the public outcry against the relationship. Leaders from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party in Israel denounced the relationship, dubbing his decision not a personal matter but rather a “symbol of the Jewish people.” Even the younger Netanyahu’s uncle, Hagai Ben-Artzi, publicly spoke out against the alleged relationship, denouncing it as an affront to the Jewish people.
“This is the most awful thing that is threatening and was a threat throughout the history of the Jewish people,” Ben-Artzi told an ultra-orthadox website, according to the BBC. “More awful than leaving Israel is marriage with a gentile. If this happens, God forbid, I’ll bury myself I don’t know where. I’ll walk in the streets and tear off my hair — and here this is happening.”
Intermarriage, or the marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew, has long been a subject of controversy in the Jewish community. Since Jewish law requires that the religion be passed down through the mother, the children of a Jewish man and a non-Jewish woman would not be considered Jewish — something that is seen as a critical threat to the survival of the religious community.
Netanyahu’s dating choices, however, are not threatening, nor should they be debated in the public spotlight. The fact of the matter is that Netanyahu and Leikanger are far from walking down the aisle, and even if they decided to marry, there wouldn’t be anything unusual about it. In fact, in the United States, more than four out of five marriages involving non-Orthodox Jews are intermarriages, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center.
In addition, Netanyahu wouldn’t be the first child of an Israeli leader to date a non-Jew. Amos Ben-Gurion, the son of Israel’s first Prime Minister and primary founding father David Ben-Gurion, married a non-Jew. Amos Ben-Gurion’s son, Alon Ben-Gurion, also went on to marry a non-Jew. Even Netanyahu’s own second wife, Fleur Cates, was not originally Jewish, though she later converted.
Many of Netanyahu’s more vocal critics argue that his decisions should reflect those of the son of a political family in the Jewish state. And though the issue of intermarriage is one of major concern in the Jewish community, marriage should not be an issue in this case. Not only are Leikanger and Netanyahu not yet in the process of getting married, but their entire relationship is also unconfirmed. Rather than jump to conclusions and blast a relationship that might not even exist, the public should instead recognize that they’re talking about college students.
Like all children in the public spotlight, Netanyahu will likely withstand much public scrutiny in the future. Just as the public watched the evolution of Prince William’s relationship with the then non-royal Kate Middleton, this will probably be one of the many instances in which the people weigh in on the private decisions of their leaders. Such is the price of being in the public eye, especially as the child in an important political family. This predictable media frenzy, however, does not excuse Israel’s leading political figures publicly commenting on the supposed relationship. There are certainly more important things facing Israel — diplomatic relations with Iran and the on-going negotiations with Palestinians — than an alleged relationship between college students.
