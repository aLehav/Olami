The Women of Troy had let a 13-point halftime lead slip all the way down to one in the second half. The Ducks were surging and all the momentum was in their favor. The USC women’s basketball team (10-6, 5-1), riding high on a four-game winning streak, was not about to let this game get away. The Women of Troy beat Oregon 92-73 in Thursday’s home game.

A free throw by junior forward Christina Marinacci and a 3-pointer by senior guard Ashley Corral sent the team on its way to what would be a game-deciding 17-3 run spanning just under four minutes.
Senior guard Briana Gilbreath came up a rebound shy of a triple-double for the Women of Troy as she led the way with 18 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds. Her leadership proved decisive for USC in the team’s breakaway run. After the game, she emphazised USC coach Michael Cooper’s reminders to develop a killer instinct.
“We let our focus down in the beginning of the second half,” Gilbreath said. “But coach has been emphasizing us having a killer instinct in practice and I think we did a good job in pulling away like we did.” Gilbreath said.
Cooper also emphasized that they handled Oregon’s zone defense very well and that learning how to succeed against different defenses as they continue their schedule will only make the team stronger for the postseason.
The Women of Troy outrebounded Oregon by 19. The increase in rebounds has been an important factor in their recent surge in the standings, leaving them alone in second place in the Pac-12. Marinacci, who had a double-double of 14 points and 10 rebounds, talked about how important the rebounds were for the team.

“Its another way to get energy and get second chance opportunites,” Marinacci said. “We noticed very soon that they weren’t as athletic as we were and we were able to take advantage of that mismatch. It’s one that we don’t usually have.”
The Women of Troy accumulated 25 assists in the game, one of the highest totals they have had all season. Gilbreath said this exemplifies how much teamwork is being used to achieve the team’s winning streak.
“We attribute the 25 assists to teamwork,” Gilbreath said. “We are all about getting each other open shots, and we did it with only 12 turnovers too.”
The Women of Troy shot 86 percent from the free-throw line — easily their best total in any game this season.
The women’s basketball team hopes to continue their winning ways and stay near the top of the PAC-12 standings when they play Oregon State at home Saturday at 2 p.m.
The lead completely disappeared down one in the second half so maybe you were not there in person.
The sad part was less than 600 in attendance for a team who plays exciting although sometimes out of
control in contrast to the men who are boring and losing. A campaign is needed by your publication to
promote women’s basketball to get behind this team for the stretch run.

The USC men’s basketball team has enjoyed a fairly exciting run over the last five years.
Pointing fingers · Head coach Kevin O’Neill displays his frustrations with his players at a recent contest. The Trojans are 5-14 on the season and sit —last place in this year’s relatively weak Pac-12 Conference. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Outside of the 2009-2010 season, in which the team faced postseason ineligibility, the Trojans have managed to muscle their way to a berth in the NCAA tournament every season — and a spot in the Pac-10 title game three times — since 2006. During that stretch, USC netted a Pac-10 title and a Sweet Sixteen appearance.
These achievements top off seasons in which USC did unseen things. The Trojans knocked off seven ranked teams in the 2006-2007 season, beat a top-five team on the road in 2008 and swept UCLA in 2009-2010.
When one considers these five years of relative success, coupled with a re-tuned athletic department and a shimmering arena to play in, it is only logical to expect another year of high-caliber play. Unfortunately, those who’ve filed into the Galen Center this season know this is not the case.
The Trojans sit firmly in the cellar of the Pac-12, at 5-14, with zero conference wins. The team’s usually solid defensive play has not been able to make up for its offensive ineptitude, which has reached a new low this season. USC ranks 339th out of 344 in assists per game nationally — one of the team’s better offensive statistics. The team’s points per game and rebounds per game clock in at a dreadful 341st and 342nd in the country. These stats put them ahead of only a handful of teams in Division I-A, one of which is Towson University, a school that has lost 35 straight games.
Obviously there are a number of excuses for USC, which has dealt with its fair share of setbacks prior to this season. It was bad enough the NBA draft claimed star forward Nikola Vucevic before his senior season, but when junior guard and team leader Jio Fontan tore his anterior cruciate ligament in March, the Trojans faced a serious personnel predicament. Alongside sophomore guard Maurice Jones, much of the burden fell on newcomer forward Dewayne Dedmon, who was forced out in November because of a stress fracture in his foot.
But injuries in collegiate athletics are to be expected, and the necessary precautions should be in place to prevent the loss of a player, which can translate into the loss of a season. This would be the case at any school, let alone a university that is trying desperately to change fans’ perception of its basketball program as a whole.
As evidenced by recent events, these precautions seem to be missing.
The conundrum the Trojans find themselves in has the potential to be incredibly damaging, beyond the currently dismal season that is being written into the history books.
The past success of the team proved that USC, traditionally a football school, could win basketball games on a national stage. But one season of re-building, if it continues along the current downward spiral, can be just as persuasive in telling future recruits the Trojans don’t have the staying power other major universities have. Without this vote of confidence, the work this team has done over the past half-decade will be forgotten.
Though the current team might not deserve this burden, it remains. USC has the infrastructure and the fan support to continue to rise, so there is little reason to allow a potential 25-loss season to mar the other work it has done. Unlike Texas, Florida and UCLA, there’s no guarantee a couple rebuilding seasons can lead to national contention a year or two down the road, which makes it more vital than ever to perform now.
All obstacles considered, it won’t be easy for the Trojans to salvage this season and to turn in a respectable second-half. But if there were ever a driving-motivation to do so, that reason exists now.
The future of the program is counting on it.

The team lacks a good coach thanks to former AD Mike Garrett who pushed Tim Floyd out and used the
basketball program to help soften the possible football sanctions which of course backfired completely.

Sophomore guard Maurice Jones and redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon combined for 40 points against Oregon Thursday night, but the Trojans (5-14, 0-6) stumbled yet again, falling to the Ducks 65-62 at Matthew Knight Arena in Eugene, Ore.
A bright spot · Sophomore redshirt forward Dewayne Dedmon had 18 points and seven rebounds against Oregon Thursday, by far his best scoring output of the season. On the year, Dedmon is averaging just over seven points and five rebounds. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The loss marked USC’s seventh straight, dropping the team to 0-6 in Pac-12 play, the team’s worst start since the 1988-1989 season when it opened 0-12.
The Trojans had arguably one of their best shooting performances of the season, converting 25 of 61 field goal attempts — just the second time in the last 10 games they had shot more than 40 percent from the field. Yet, they but uncharacteristically had issues on the defensive end of the floor.
Led by guard Garrett Sim’s four 3-pointers, Oregon (14-5, 5-2) was able to shoot 46 percent, including 38 percent from beyond the arc. Additionally, the Ducks outrebounded USC, 31-24.
The Trojans’ efforts were complicated – somewhat — because of the absence of their leading rebounder and second-leading scorer, junior forward Aaron Fuller.
Fuller is scheduled to have surgery next week to repair a torn labrum in his left (shooting) shoulder and will miss the remainder of the season. Through 18 games, the Iowa transfer averaged 10.6 points and 5.9 rebounds. The injury leaves USC all the more thin in terms of depth. Against Oregon, USC coach Kevin O’Neill played just six scholarship players, including two freshmen in guards Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley.
Both Moore and Wesley struggled to get going offensively, shooting a combined 4-of-15 from the field.
USC, collectively at least, was effective early. Over the course of the first 20 minutes, it shot 46 percent from the field, including 40 percent from 3-point range.
But in the second half, it struggled and went 0-for-8 from beyond the arc – similar to its Jan. 8 contest against Arizona when it converted just 1-of-15 3-point attempts.
Dedmon and Jones, as a result, shouldered much of the scoring load. The 7-foot center’s 18 points marked a career-high and Jones’ 22 points were the third-most he had scored in a game this season. And the 5-foot-7 Jones was perhaps even more dangerous in the waning moments, hitting a pair of free throws with 24 seconds left to pull the Trojans within one point.
But on the next possession, guard Devoe Joseph, who finished with 16 points, nailed two free throws to give the Ducks a late three-point lead they would never relinquish.
Jones did have one final chance to tie the game with six seconds remaining in the contest, but his 3-pointer was off target.
Searching for their first win in conference play, the Trojans will next head to Corvallis, Ore., on Saturday to face Oregon State. It won’t be easy.
Though the Beavers (12-7, 2-5) have stumbled in Pac-12 play early on, they boast the conference’s leading scorer in guard Jared Cunningham, who as of Thursday, is averaging 17.6 points per contest. The 6-foot-4 guard scored 35 points in two games against USC last season.
USC leads the all-time series between the two programs 67-58.
Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. and will be televised by Fox Sports Prime Ticket.

Members of the university and community paid tribute to the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration, hosted by USC Black Staff and Faculty Caucus in Bovard Auditorium on Thursday.
Gospel of truth · Thorton alumna and distinguished guest Lura Daniels-Ball sang at USC’s 31st annual Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration in Bovard Auditorium Thursday. - Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
The 31st annual event included spoken word, songs and personal experiences with King. One purpose of the celebration was to inspire students to honor the integral part King played in shaping higher education, said Cynthia Brass, administrative assistant of recreational sports and coordinator of the event.
“Some still don’t understand the concept of King as far as his contribution to allowing minorities the opportunity to be a student at a university,” Brass said. “It’s to make sure they know that because Dr. King opened several doors, they were able to get as far as they are today.”
Makiah Green, a junior majoring in English, said recognizing King also results in the remembrance of other leaders that have influenced society.
“Black history in this country is often forgotten, and he seems like the only icon that is really remembered,” Green said. “He allows people to segue into introducing other forgotten heroes.”
Najee Ritter, a senior majoring in theater, said King contributed to the diversity on campus through his advocacy of human rights.
“USC is all about leadership and I think he is the quintessential example of leadership,” Ritter said. “A lot of young college students were involved with the movement, and King inspires us to stay active and remain involved in the community.”
Timothy Conley, front office coordinator of the University Religious Center, said his mother, Carloyn Conley-Roper, an undergraduate business administration student during the 1960s, overcame many obstacles of racial inequality at USC while trying to gain her education.
“It was a very different time,” Conley said. “Access and opportunity were limited and not just for the black students. It was challenging to be a student here for anyone that was considered to be a minority.”
Students on campus were eager for change but strategic during the tumultuous time of the movement, Conley said.
“My mother was at USC during the Watt Riots, and that played a lot into the mentality of the students,” Conley said. “They were sick of the vicious racism and they were revolutionary, but they weren’t violent or using any means necessary.”
Vajun Soni, dean of religious life, said although racial prejudice existed at USC in the 1960s, the university was taking progressive actions toward equality.
“The fact that we had black students on campus was actually part of the movement of providing equity and access,” Soni said. “The students represented what the civil rights movement was about, which was developing higher education for all students that deserved to be at all institutions.”
USC has evolved since the Civil Rights Movement and has become a proud part of the L.A. community through its many volunteer efforts, Conley said.
“Dr. King’s movement was about all people embracing and uniting and helping one another. USC is on the forefront of that kind of work,” Conley said. “This is what Dr. King was preaching about. This is what he was fighting for.”

With the release of his first book, The End of Illness, on Tuesday, Dr. David Agus, a professor in the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Keck School of Medicine, hopes to make strides in understanding health and in calling for health care reform.
The End of Illness calls for increasing preventative medicine. Agus said this concept comes from his dual training, which allows him to view health problems from the perspective of the body as a whole, rather than looking at specific systems.
“I am a cancer doctor, so I look at people in the face every day and I say, ‘I don’t have any more drugs to treat you’ … and so we really brought the idea that we have to push to prevent disease,” Agus said.
Agus calls his book a comprehensive new look at health.
“[The book goes] through all the data and complications of vitamins,” Agus said. “It talks about … going from aspirin to statin to how they can dramatically lower your rate of inflammation and thereby heart disease and cancer.”
As a professor of medicine and engineering, Agus gauges his two specialties to provide a unique insight to health.
“Biologists try to understand one single pathway and then try to understand everything, whereas engineers realize [there are] complex systems you can’t always understand,” Agus said. “So, thinking like an engineer about medicine really is a whole new way of approaching it.”
Aside from continuing to run the USC Westside Prostate Cancer Center in Beverly Hills, Agus has begun looking toward his next project.
“The modeling that we talk about in the book, we have received a large grant from the National Cancer Institute to really apply that to cancer; to use the principles — the physics and math — to approach cancer,” Agus said.
Since the release of the book, Agus has made appearances on Nightline and Good Morning America.
“The Nightline reporter came to USC to see me last Friday, and he was a 34-year-old guy … healthy, skinny and exercises all the time,” Agus said. “We looked at his genetics, and it [turned] out he was at higher risk for heart disease. So, we did a heart scan, and it turned out he had heart disease.”
The lack of Americans who proactively try to prevent disease is a problem, Agus said.
“The problem with most health care is that you wait until you’re sick before you seek it,” Agus said. “I want to move health care to the prevention mode; I want to prevent people from getting illnesses.”
In his laboratory on the Health Sciences Campus, Agus and his team are working on developing a more comparable marker from one person to the next.
“Right now, we don’t have a universal marker for health — that’s a problem,” Agus said.
Dr. Argus is on the right track.  The chronic diseases that are killing Americans and costing them billions in healthcare need never exist; Heart disease, high cholesterol, adult onset diabetes, MS, even some cancers are food borne illnesses.  You give them to yourself in your poor dietary choices.  Multiple gold standard research studies prove that you can prevent and in many cases reverse the disease by following a whole food, plant based diet and getting exercise.  it really is that easy.  Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr Neal Barnard, Dr. T Colin Campbell, Dr. John Mac Dougall, Dr Doug Lisle and others have been helping patients for many years.  Read their books and check their facts!  See Forks Over Knives.  The life you save may be your own.
I hate to break it to you, but you will also die one day.  You’re assuming you will extend your life by eating plants. Which study shows vegetarians outlive their meat-eating peers?  Common sense dictates that eating a variety of foods in MODERATION, including meat (gasp!), and exercising regularly will make you a happy person until such day that you get hit by a bus.

The USC School of Social Work hosted the event to highlight a four-year, $7.6-million program focused on researching and offering support for K-12 students with family members in the armed services. The Building Capacity in Military-Connected Schools Program, now in its second year, is funded by the Department of Defense Education Activity.
“You are building bridges that connect military and civilian children, educate teachers and principals and provide the support our military children deserve,” Biden said.
Biden spoke about her personal connection to the project as a military mother. Her son, Beau Biden, was deployed to Iraq for one year.
“Beau has two young children himself, so I know firsthand just how important it is for a child to have the support of a community and school while mom or dad is at war,” Biden said.
Biden said her granddaughter’s teacher hung a picture of Beau Biden’s unit while he was deployed.
“Every day when she walked into her class, she would stop and kiss her dad, and all her schoolmates knew that her dad was away at war,” Jill Biden said. “I’ve heard over and over again how important it is that school can be a supportive environment for military children.”
USC started a military social work program in 2007, in part to respond to returning veterans, Vice Dean of the School of Social Work Paul Maiden said.
Anthony M. Hassan, a clinical associate professor and director, said the university has long worked with military veterans.
“The university has a military history through its ROTC program and it’s the only research university in the nation that has a military research social work program,” Hassan said.
Ron Avi Astor, the Building Capacity program’s principal investigator, said Jill Biden has been watching the program’s progress.
“She’s been following our stuff through newsletters, and she is trying to get the Joining Forces campaign people to get involved with it,” Astor said.
Following her remarks, Jill Biden participated in a roundtable discussion in which students, parents and educators shared empirical examples of how schools have helped military families.
Seventh-grader Kayla Felizardo spoke of joining a pride club for military students at Wolf Canyon Elementary School in Chula Vista, Calif. She started at Wolf Canyon last January after living in Japan for three years.
“We would just talk and express how we felt about the military and our experience on moving and making friends,” Felizardo said.
After the event, Jill Biden said the stories she heard from students and educators illustrate the type of support military families need.
“That’s so important and that’s what we want for military families,” she said. “That’s what Joining Forces is all about.”

Pulp Shakespeare, a play that opened Jan. 12 for another run in Hollywood’s Theater Asylum, is not your average mashup.
Remixing Pulp Fiction — often considered filmmaker Quentin Tarantino’s magnum opus — with the unmistakable literary style of Shakespeare might seem strange. It might even seem blasphemous to  fervent Tarantino or Bard fans, but this fusion is by no means a mistake. Though it might be hard to see past the blood and profanity, there probably isn’t a more perfect movie to adapt into Shakespearean style.

Pulp Fiction exposes Tarantino’s specific filmmaking approach better than any of his other films. There are boundless movie references, characters spewing a ton of blood, intense Mexican standoffs and people brandishing Samurai swords. Above all of Tarantino’s trademarks, however, lies his love of language and wordplay.
Tarantino’s perfectionist writing habits are well known, and when the curtain rises on Pulp Shakespeare, one can see how perfectly this dialogue can be adapted into something reminiscent of Shakespeare’s poetic structure and impossibly sharp wit.
The famous exchange at the beginning of Pulp Fiction between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson about the significance of a foot massage, for instance, becomes a poetic play on words, reminiscent of Shakespeare’s expert rhetorical puns and insinuations.
“He tread on dangerous ground, and ground lovingly on her dangerous treads,” says Jules Winnfield, played by Dan White in a fantastic interpretation, whose witty, sarcastic bite has been utterly unsullied by a four-century shift in setting.
Certain elements of Pulp Fiction are difficult to adapt from the film onto stage, and adding the 400-year change makes certain scenes untranslatable.
Similarly, one complaint about mash-ups is that they rarely develop past their components and become something truly unique. Instead, many of these hybrids depend solely on source material that already exists.
But the Shakespearean makeover brings a charm of its own. If you know the movie well, it will be exciting to sit there wondering how certain memorable lines are going to be adapted and delivered. One especially pleasing part of Pulp Shakespeare is how it replaces Tarantino’s notorious profanity with Shakespeare’s well-known slights. And the inevitable references to actual Shakespeare quotes are peppered throughout.
In this case, Vincent Vega, Travolta’s character in Pulp Fiction, put it best: The funniest things are the little differences.
It’s all about the details, and humor comes from something as simple as a kangaroo in the movie turning into a dragon in the play and shotguns becoming broadswords. Even the Buddy Holly waiter from Pulp Fiction’s Jack Rabbit Slim’s restaurant returns here as a waiter from Richard III in a scene-stealing instant.
Some things, however, remain untouched for effect: Tarantino’s favorite, the samurai sword, makes another appearance here.
Pulp Shakespeare is really a collection of delights for any fan of the original cult classic. If you love the movie, you will love this show. It doesn’t really matter if you don’t like Shakespearean prose because seeing the enchantingly clever interpretation will help you forget all about those stuffy “thous” and “thines.”
Unfortunately, if you haven’t seen Pulp Fiction,  you probably won’t understand much of the play. A remedy, of course, would be simply to find a copy of Pulp Fiction and watch it. For better or worse, Pulp Shakespeare can only give you the full experience if you understand the background and contexts for all those hilarious interpretations.
The full experience of the show, however, makes the film an especially worthwhile watch.

Show two people half an episode of the anime Fullmetal Alchemist and you would probably get very different responses. One might say it is a lighthearted comedy of brotherly love. The other might say it’s a tragedy about the nature of divinity and the consequences of man playing God. These coalescing tones are one reason Fullmetal Alchemist  is a highly watched anime.
Acclaimed anime · The film spinoff of Full Metal Alchemist incorporates a divided plot line, featuring a tale of brotherhood and the dangers of man playing God, to give the series a refreshing new take as brothers Edward (left) and Alphonse Elric (right) chase after an escaped prisoner. - Photo courtesy of Eleven Arts
Its spinoff film, Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos, directed by Kazuya Murata, explores a mix of malaise and merriment with all the flair of the television series. That it does not go beyond the standards of the anime, however, could disappoint certain viewers.
For the uninitiated, the world of FMA is a steam-punk version of Industrial-era Europe. Alchemy, in the world of FMA, is a high form of science that allows the transmutation of objects, such as a crowbar into a claymore, as long as there is an equal exchange of matter. The only transgression in alchemy is to perform transmutation on a human.
Edward and Alphonse Elric, protagonists and brothers, break this taboo after their mother dies, and the disastrous experiment leaves Ed dismembered and Al’s body destroyed with his soul bound to a suit of armor. Now Ed has become an elite alchemist working for the government, while also trying to find a way to restore their bodies.
In The Sacred Star of Milos, the government sends the Elrics after an escaped prisoner, who is also a talented alchemist. Tracking the convict to the neighboring country of Creta, the brothers run straight into an uprising. The people of a slum-ridden valley called Milos are fighting to reclaim their country. To win, they want to invoke an ancient power in the land, despite learning it will require human sacrifices.
The Sacred Star of Milos is actually the second FMA movie, with Conqueror of Shamballa as the first. However, the two films take place in separate timelines. Shamballa takes place after the first series, and Milos takes place in the same chronology as the remake TV series, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
FMA has always posed questions — the immutableness of death, the foundations of morality and the conflict of goodness versus intention, to name a few. It’s not a philosophy dissertation in the vein of Xenosaga, but it adds complexity to the story. Milos is driven by the question of sacrifice in the name of truth.
Though the series often connected these questions to the antagonists, Milos’ chief bad guy simply swoops into kill mode. If there is an answer to the question of sacrifice, here it seems to be “don’t be so eager to die for a cause — someone might oblige you.”
The characterizations remain consistent between series and film. Ed is full of hot-headed charm and, occasionally, hard-won wisdom. Al is as cute and cuddly as a hulking suit of armor can be, but with a melancholy that sometimes makes itself known.
The film’s animation has more fancy effects than the TV series, and the run time is substantially longer — yet it still comes across as a standard episode. If you were a Pokémon fan in elementary school, think back to the awe and wonder of Pokémon: The First Movie. The battles were more epic, and the drama was more intense than the television show.
Milos is longer than a usual FMA episode, but not more enthralling. The battles might be flashier, but they are only just as compelling as they are in the series. This is not necessarily a weakness — FMA is a popular show for a reason — but one can’t help but wish the film had something extra besides length.
As it stands, Milos is like a good episode of FMA. Not the best. Not the worst.
Newcomers to FMA should not start with the films. Though Ed and Al’s backstory is mentioned, the true horror remains unspoken. Because the film takes place in the middle of the series’ chronology, the characters have already been developed, and there is little context for their thoughts or actions beyond the events in the film.
The ambiguity is not necessarily a flaw of the film itself, but rather a misstep involving the assumption that viewers are familiar with the canon. Those who aren’t familiar will be stuck wondering, for example, why there’s a guy named Roy Mustang who has no apparent bearing on the plot.
Fans of the series should not fear. Milos isn’t just milk from a cash cow. The film is its own self-contained story that fits easily into Brotherhood.
It just happens to fit so well that you might watch it and wonder why the episode feels so long.

Many of us forget about the musical guests on late-night talk shows. There is, of course, the omnipresent house band that provides a soundtrack for the show, but every program needs a good guest performance to cap things off.
How each late-night show handles their guests, though, is worth discussing.
Statistically speaking, musical guest performances on late-night television are the least viewed elements of the show.
Most people tune in at some point during the host’s monologue and stay through the first big-name guest. From there, the viewing numbers gradually decline throughout the rest of the hour long program.
Even with reduced viewership at the end of the program, however, artists can still expect to perform for an audience of more than one million viewers (Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show and David Letterman’s The Late Show average the highest numbers each night with about 3.5 million and 3.1 million total viewers, respectively, according to Nielsen ratings).
Naturally, performing on a late-night show is a highly sought-after opportunity. But strategy must also be considered when planning guest performances.
Artists often have a specific target program in mind when trying to maximize their time in the national spotlight. An indie-rock or metal band, for example, probably does not want to perform on Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show, since its demographic skews toward older crowds.
Smaller, more modern bands tend to thrive, however, on programs like Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Live! that have target demographics in the 18-to 34-year-old range.
The easiest way to understand the differences between each show is to take a look at who handles the booking and what process he or she follows.
Barbera Libis handles artist bookings for The Tonight Show, and the guests she books tend to be tamer, as they need to appeal to the show’s general audience. The Tonight Show prides itself on being watchable, without ruffling many feathers. Acts like Eric Clapton, although not necessarily the norm, are to be expected.
Meanwhile, Sheryl Zilikson handles the music reins for Leno’s main competitor, the Late Show with David Letterman. These acts tend to be a little more potent so as to complement the host’s fiery personality — think of acts like Janelle Monáe or Foo Fighters here.
Viewers can find the most variety, though, when hosts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon take the stage in later timeslots. As these shows skew toward younger audiences, the selections tend to be a bit more obscure and fresh, which can lead to new music discoveries.
For example, the musical guests on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon frequently  match the off-kilter, unexpected flavor of the show. House band The Roots provides a hip-hop/soul element each night, but the range of acts that share the stage with them is usually quite eclectic and unpredictable. For this reason, music booker Jonathan Cohen has the freedom to book artists that range from rockers My Chemical Romance to controversial rap collective Odd Future — and even the iconic Bruce Springsteen.
Matching the hipness of Late Night, Scott Igoe of Jimmy Kimmel Live! does perhaps the best job of striking a balance between well-known acts and smaller performers making their national debuts. His greatest weapon is that Jimmy Kimmel’s show offers three different stages for artists to perform on.
Kimmel’s set includes a small stage in the studio next to the host’s desk, a slightly larger stage for moderately popular acts in the studio’s vestibule and a large outdoor stage off Hollywood Boulevard, on which superstar artists, such as Lady Gaga, perform.
The range of Kimmel’s venues allows the show to book smaller acts like Matt & Kim on the side stages and mainstream artists on the outdoor stage. The show is also not afraid to book more adventurous artists, such as metal band Rammstein, whose performance featured a shower of pyrotechnics and guttural screaming.
Capping off the list of talent directors is Conan’s Jim Pitt. Conan O’Brien prided himself on the musical aspect of his show while he hosted on NBC, and this emphasis did  not change after his network switch to TBS.
The show frequently draws high-profile artists like Green Day but also focuses on booking bands that are on the verge of breaking out. The timeliness of performances frequently coincides with new releases, and Pitt seems to have his finger nicely placed on the pulse of the music scene — which is probably why he lands breakout acts like Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, just as the band is starting to gain national merit.
In the same way each host appeals to different viewers, the musical bookings play to specific tastes. If you are looking to discover something new, tune in to Jimmy Kimmel. If you are looking for the next rising star, flip to Conan O’Brien. If you are trying to keep up with what’s popular, look to Jimmy Fallon. And, if you are only passively intrigued by musical guests, stick with Jay Leno and David Letterman, as they are bound to book someone with mainstream appeal.
 
Nick Mindicino is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. His column “Industry Ballads” runs Fridays. 
Very well written article and very informative.  Seems like a lot of research was put into this piece…..great job!  No matter what band you are in it is good to land a gig on any one of these shows that is for sure!  Love Jimmy Kimmel Live show..he has some great performers.

With all the urban art  displayed in museums and galleries, it’s easy to think that if you’ve seen one street art show, you’ve seen them all. But that would be a terrible misunderstanding.
Avant-garde · Max Neutra captivates viewers by mixing media and materials, such as spray paint and sculpture, giving his compositionally complex work an exaggerated sense of three-dimensionality. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Among the galleries highlighting the many styles of street art is the Downtown Los Angeles Crewest Gallery. The gallery is currently displaying “Audio Canvas 3,” an exhibition that showcases the talent of a few chosen artists and pairs their craft with live music. At the show’s opening, artists created their pieces while tunes were doled out by a nearby DJ. The  white walls of the gallery became the canvases for colorfully explosive, exciting pieces.
Though not all the pieces are created straight on the wall, there are no reservations about going beyond the canvas.
Vyal Reyes’ piece, an untitled work created mostly on a vertical frame, comes to life as it flows onto the walls of the canvas. It’s a highly detailed work with lots of energy and plenty of bubble-like figures. The work sticks to a limited color palette and creates the illusion of shining forms with expert touches of white. Though the swirling composition makes the piece look like something out of a dream, the bubble-like creations are deftly colored so that their shape is realistic. By letting the paint go beyond the conventional canvas, Reyes makes the piece maintain its street art edge.
Even the pieces that are on canvases manage to have a movement and emotional depth that would capture the attention of passers by.
Man One’s piece “Reaching Up” is not only aesthetically fascinating but also philosophically interesting. Man One, who also owns Crewest, created the piece with a narrative in mind. The vertical canvas shows a bright otherworldly figure reaching up for the top of a spray paint can, a symbol for how street art can lift you out of negativity. The work is part of a series of characters that Man One calls “graffiti spirits.” The background of the piece, which is white, save for a few graffiti tags, represents the negativity the artist finds in the city and the “graffiti spirit” in the foreground rises from it all.
The figure is mysterious and slightly frightening. Man One’s use of bright colors against a gray background makes the spirit even more impactful; the colors are blended to create sharp contrasts, and small dashes of color are placed sporadically throughout to add variety, depth and shadows. You’re hard-pressed to find any area that is exactly one solid color.
The exhibition also includes works from Black Light Kings, a combo made up of street artists Axa and Pops. During the day, the artists’ pieces are complex and fascinating to look at, but at night a black light goes onto its surface and the pieces are transformed. Three pieces on the right show creepy, dark scenes including a skull face. To the right is a sprawling, highly detailed work with everything from a realistic human heart to a crazed jungle cat. The larger piece uses canvas and wall, but the three framed pieces include butterflies that are spray painted onto the wall.
But not all the show consists of dark matter. Max Neutra’s playful pieces are humorous and visually intriguing. Save for a few canvases, “Ice Cream” —  a smaller segment within the larger artwork — is placed directly on the wall, amazing viewers with its impressive size.
Neutra plays with the composition of the piece as a whole; he chooses to spray paint a small pedestal on the wall and mounts his piece “Ice Cream” on top. The ice cream cone itself is on a small canvas but is worth a closer look. The cone is actually three cones — a stack of pink, blue and black cones — that line up to create a visually fascinating image of a common object.
“Eye” is a dazzling piece, especially considering its ordinary subject. The eye is created with multi-colored hues, and Neutra lets the colors drip down, adding a dramatic and interesting effect. His other works are equally stimulating, resembling bright images from comic book pages.
This group of artists’ work creates a show that proves street art is continuing to grow. “Audio Canvas 3” might be a somewhat small exhibition, but it makes up for its size by presenting an impressive spectrum of art styles. When you drive away, you might even spot one of the works in its natural habitat.
 
Crewest Gallery is located on 110 Winston St. “Audio Canvas 3” runs through Jan. 29.

Stephen Colbert has done it again. He’s infiltrated the presidential race. Some Americans, however, are less than pleased with the television personality’s election plans, finding them a degrading mockery of the election.
These Americans are absolutely right.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
Such derision was Colbert’s exact intent. He wanted to mock and to degrade the aspects of the election he was showcasing, notably the bizarre bodies known as super political action committees. And why? Because they deserve to be mocked and degraded.
Super PACs take all the inherent evils of mass campaigning — distraction from issues, brutal mudslinging, richer candidates trouncing better ones — and supersize them.
Even worse, they completely alienate those working at the grassroots level, particularly college students.
Candidates already spend an enormous amount of money on campaigning. Super PACs, however, allow private groups to hop aboard the sinking ship. Super PACs can raise unlimited sums from any corporation, union, interest group or individual and use them to openly support a candidate, so long as they pretend to have no connection to the candidate’s campaign.
Grassroots campaigns stand no chance against the spectacle put on by super PACs. As a result, the presidential race has become less about examining the strengths and weaknesses of candidates and their platforms and more about who can make a flashier TV commercial. Students who might sincerely care about these platforms and about the country’s future, meanwhile, get to watch all their hard work go to waste.
The Federal Election Commission places no limit on the amount a super PAC can spend on an independent campaign expenditure, provided the candidate remains unaffiliated. The absurdity of trying to determine affiliation is what motivated Jon Stewart to mockingly christen his 2012 Colbert PAC, “The Definitely Not Coordinating with Stephen Colbert Super PAC.”
Colbert clearly isn’t fooled by such pathetic legislative runaround. And we shouldn’t be either. The super PAC is just another way to make campaigning even more exorbitant, to take even more voters’ minds off the real issues and to further crush the youth demographic beneath the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent.
Super PACs ensure that the country answers to the majority of wealth, not to the majority of people. They make individual action and grassroots campaigning impossible to carry out effectively.
In particular, super PACs hurt college students and other young people, whose primary means of getting involved in presidential campaigns are low-budget, gradual expansion initiatives. Those initiatives are where democracy lies. Lately, however, democracy has taken a backseat to the bureaucratic approach.
The FEC needs to abolish super PACs, or at least take back control of the election from their greedy hands. Only then can we hear the sincere voice of the candidates, and only then will they be obligated to listen to ours.

Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum: As if these four Republican presidential contenders weren’t enough to occupy the electorate’s attention, Stephen Colbert just threw himself into the mix.
In last Thursday’s episode of The Colbert Report, Comedy Central’s king of political satire said that he would be forming “an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork” — in other words, a super political action committee — for his possible presidential run.

Colbert’s elaborate joke brings to light an important issue: the legality and fairness of the super PAC.
The super PAC rose in popularity following the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court ruling. Whereas individuals cannot directly donate more than $5,000 to presidential campaigns, anyone can now funnel unlimited independent expenditures into a super PAC, as long as the super PAC is not directly linked to a political party or candidate.
Colbert’s super PAC mocks what he and many others see as the transparent potential for corruption inherent in campaign finance laws. A concern less often raised is a super PAC’s potential to suppress the voices of young people — particularly college students — who do not have the resources to compete with massive corporations for influence.
Though this concern is legitimate, money is not the only factor influencing elections. People without the financial capital to contribute make their voices heard through grassroots mobilization and the public exercise of First Amendment rights.
The argument against super PACs disregards the idea that individual political action, grassroots support and the media can have as much power as money. Though a large sum of money from a super PAC might give Newt Gingrich the opportunity to produce an ad slamming Mitt Romney, a critical public’s reaction is what really matters in the long run.
Take the Tea Party as an example. Whether voters agree or disagree with the Tea Party’s platform, these passionate citizens have brought widespread attention to their cause.
A more recent example is the Occupy movement, one which some USC students support and have participated in. Though it is not directly connected to the campaign finance debate, the movement has influenced the liberal side of the election. Protestors’ anti-corporatism cries still resonate today, obviously without the slightest influence of corporate money.
Just as political speech and action should not be suppressed by government, those with the financial resources to contribute to political campaigns should not have their influence stomped out by excessive regulations.
People need to work with what they have to get their voices heard, whether they are corporate executives or starving college students. Barring that right would be an affront to the constitution and an insult to voters’ intelligence.

It doesn’t come as a shock that Coachella sold out so quickly this year, especially with headliners like Snoop Dogg, Radiohead, Dr. Dre and returning Coachella player The Black Keys. Goldenvoice, Coachella’s promoter, sold around 120,000 tickets in just under three hours on Friday January 13th, breaking last year’s record of selling out in six days.
The Black Keys will play Friday night along with Cat Power, Arctic Monkeys, Afrojack and Explosions in the Sky to name a few. The big names for Saturday include Radiohead as well as Bon Iver and Andrew Bird, while Sunday will wrap up the three day show with artists like AVICII, La Roux, Beirut and of course the duo of Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.
So the lineup  is pretty amazing this year with each day characterized by a unique vibe and it’s not surprising that tickets sold out so quickly even when considering the fact that Coachella expanded to two weekends this year and thus doubled the amount of tickets.
Unlike previous years, the same artists will play in identical lineups for the two weekends of April 13-15 and April 20-22. Tickets for Coachella 2012 first went on sale for a week last June, and not knowing the lineup didn’t stop people from snapping them up. And for people who missed the ticket-buying frenzy last week, there’s still the last resort of purchasing tickets on websites like StubHub or from scalpers.
For those who did manage to get tickets, they’re in for some crazy shows – especially those that bought tickets for both weekends.
