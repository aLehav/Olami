Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele knew the second he heard the play call that he was going to make a full effort to block the potential game-tying field goal. 
“I just get around the guard and go over him and bob swat him,” Tufele said. “I was like ‘hell yeah’ and it was game over.” 
A blocked field goal and a high-scoring offense helped USC edge Washington State 39-36 in a shootout at the Coliseum on Friday. 
The Cougars attempted a game-tying 38-yard field goal with under two minutes to play, but Tufele blocked it, handing the Trojans the win and getting them back to .500 on the season. 
The Trojans edged out the final score thanks to a touchdown by redshirt sophomore running back Vavae Malepeai and a two point conversion to grant them the 3-point lead in the middle of the fourth quarter that would prove to be the final score.
The start of the fourth quarter began the shootout with Mater-Dei duo of freshmen quarterback JT Daniels and receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown connected for a 30-yard touchdown to steal the lead early in the fourth. The Cougars responded with a touchdown of their own after converting a 4th-and-one attempt.

The win comes at a crucial point in the Trojans’ season as it returns the team to a .500 record both overall and in conference play. Moreover, the victory comes after two tough losses at the hands of Texas and Stanford.
“To be able to get a win at home over a team that’s gonna be a good team this year up [in the Pac-12] North, it was critical for us,” head coach Clay Helton said. “For our confidence and our psyche. To be able to fight back and finish a game in the fourth quarter, it can only build confidence and help your football team.” 
The Trojans pounced on Washington State early in the first quarter with an energetic rushing drive. In just five plays on the ground, running backs sophomore Stephen Carr and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai drove the Trojans 75 yards to a touchdown only two minutes into the game.
Defensive rushes from the outside and pressure over the middle, including two batted passes, aided in the Trojans’ efforts to force fourth down situations. However, the Cougars, notorious for attempting fourth down conversions, were able to find their first touchdown after converting on two consecutive fourth downs.
On the offensive front, USC relied on its running backs in the first quarter. The Trojans tallied 68 rushing yards on the ground in the first 15 minutes compared to the Cougars’ six, but WSU’s passing game towered over that of the USC’s by a margin of 43 to six.
USC was quick to fire back this time, opting for an aerial route to the end zone after recognizing that the Cougars defense began stop the rush. Daniels connected with redshirt sophomore receiver Velus Jones Jr. on a 44-yard reception. The long gain set up a touchdown pass to redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns to give the Trojans a 4-point edge.
Daniels said his chemistry is improving with receivers junior Michael Pittman Jr., Jones Jr. and Vaughns. Pittman tallied 72 yards, Vaughns recorded 64 yards along with a team high seven receptions and Jones contributed 48 yards. 
“We just have more practice time. We’re getting used to each other more,” Daniels said. “I’m learning where they want me to put the ball, and they’re making the plays every time it’s there.”   
The second quarter saw USC’s more unpolished side. Preventable penalties and errors aided in Washington State’s favorable field position, resulting in a touchdown which extended the Cougars’ lead to 24-14 with 1:39 left in the half. 
The Trojans attempted to break into the end zone to end the first half but were unable to gain 7 points after three attempts from the eight-yard line — and an incomplete pass to Michael Pittman, whose foot appeared to be on the line in the back of the end zone — and settled with a field goal to close the first 30 minutes trailing 24-17.
In the game, Daniels touted 241 yards with three touchdowns compared sophomore quarterback Gardner Minshew II threw for 344 yards with three touchdowns.

USC converted three third downs in the second half, an improvement on their 0-of-4 conversions in the first half.
The Trojans delivered in front of a home crowd of 52,421 after falling behind to the Cougars late in the first half. The victory marked the Trojans 18th consecutive win at the Coliseum. 
“We walk out there with a sense of pride because we are at the Coliseum,” senior linebacker Cameron Smith said. “We know walking by everytime in the tunnel we see guys on our right that are painted on the wall that have played there before us and for me it hits me right in the heart. It feels good to be home. Feels good to get this win and move on from here.” 
USC will take on Arizona next week in Tucson as Pac-12 play continues.

Following four impressive victories this past weekend at the Aggie RoundUp, the top ranked men’s water polo team looks to continue its dominance in Saturday’s match against No. 6 Pacific at Uytengsu Aquatic Center.
The Trojans boast an undefeated record through 11 games, despite facing tough competition from teams such as No. 7 UC Santa Barbara and No. 8 UC Davis. The Trojan’s success in tournament play has come from the contributions of a variety of players. In last weekend’s game against UC Davis, 10 different players scored to propel the Trojans to a 16-9 victory. 
Freshman goalie Sam Krutonog has also been a standout for the Trojans. In their 10-3 win against UC Santa Barbara at the Aggie Roundup, Krutonog made a career-high 10 saves, resulting in his selection as MPSF Newcomer of the Week. Krutonog is the second consecutive Trojan to be nominated for this award after freshman driver Hannes Daube’s performance the previous week.
Against Pacific, another challenging opponent, the Trojans seek to achieve the same focus, preparation and cooperative effort that propelled them to prior victories.
“It’s a lot of mental preparation, watching a lot of game footage,” redshirt junior two-meter Sam Slobodien said. “We prepare every day in and out of the water for two or three hours. I just have to focus every day, watch game film, prepare mentally, physically, emotionally. We’re all there, we’ve trained all summer.”
The Tigers, who are 5-3 on the season, are coming off of two back-to-back close losses in the Aggie RoundUp against No. 3 Cal and No. 7 UC Santa Barbara. Two of their losses this season have come against the Bears. The Tigers are led offensively by redshirt sophomore utility Luke Pavillard and junior attacker Engin Ege Colak. Ege Colak has remained one of the Tigers’ leading scorers since 2016, when he was selected as the 2016 Golden Coast Conference Newcomer of the Year.
Securing a victory against this talented Pacific team is crucial for the Trojans, as they aim to defend their No. 1 spot in the NCAA rankings.
“It would be huge,” said Slobodien of the opportunity to beat a top competitor. “It’s the first real matchup of the year. We’re really excited for it, and we just hope to play well. That’s what we do every time we go out there.”
With so many talented players on the Trojans’ roster, the team is aiming to play cohesively and  take advantage of their opportunities to put up points.
“We just have to be one as a team,” Slobodien said. “We have to play unselfishly and finish our high-percentage opportunities.”
Slobodien also plays an important role as a leader of his team.
 “My goal is to get all of the guys behind us,” he said. “We all have one common goal and that is to win a national championship.”
The match begins 1 p.m. Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

Junior midfielder and English native Ashleigh Plumptre has recorded seven shots with five on frame this season. (Tal Volk | Daily Trojan)
After staying undefeated with a win over Long Beach State last weekend to improve to 7-0-1 this season, the No. 3 women’s soccer team will look to keep its record intact against Washington at McAlister Field on Saturday. 
Off to one of their best starts in history, The Trojans have gone undefeated in non-conference play this season for the first time, and their goal differential of 23-3 is the best throughout eight games of any team in history.
In its last game against Long Beach State, USC secured its sixth shutout in eight games and posted a 3-0 victory, all while celebrating the accomplishments of the team’s five seniors. Sophomore midfielder Alea Hyatt gave the Trojans a 1-0 lead heading into the half with her first goal of the season in the 31st minute. Senior Leah Pruitt racked up 2 goals in the second half when she found the back of the net in the 56th minute and headed in a cross from freshman defender Ashley Soto in the 89th minute. 
The Trojan defense was strong, allowing only one shot in each half by the 49ers while the offense fired 21 shots, outshooting their opponent 21-2 in the game. A combination of players on both ends of the field helped the Trojans maintain their multi-goal lead throughout the game. Redshirt sophomore goalie Kaylie Collins received her fifth solo shutout of the season. USC has now outscored opponents 23-3 this season, with Pruitt leading the team with 6 goals and 15 total points. She is ranked No. 3 in the most recent coaches poll and No. 4 in Top Drawer Soccer rankings. 
“I think we are doing really well on the field and off the field,” Pruitt said after their last game. “I think our relationship off the field helps bring us closer together on the field. And I think we are really competitive in practice and I think that really helps translate on the field when we really trust each other on the field, too.”
The Huskies will also be starting Pac-12 play on Saturday with a season record of 5-2-1. They head into conference play with a four-game undefeated streak, having defeated Seattle University in a 5-0 shutout last weekend.  Washington dominated defensively throughout the game, allowing no shots on goal. Senior forward Pascale Dumesnil scored the only goal in the first half with a chip shot over the goalie’s head. The offensive aggression picked up in the second half, with 4 goals from four different players to bring the total to 5 goals at the end of the game. 
Washington has now outshot their opponents 69-22 and in its last three games outscoring opponents 9-2. The Huskies have only allowed 2 first half goals and scored first in seven of their eight games this season.
The Trojans head into this game with a 14-8-2 record all-time against Huskies. 
The match is set to start at noon at McAlister Field and will be broadcast on Pac-12 Network.

Freshman quarterback JT Daniels has only thrown one touchdown so far this season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The football team comes into Friday’s game against Washington State at the Coliseum reeling from a brutal dismantling on the road against Texas, their second in as many weeks, leaving them 1-2 on the season. The loss sent the Trojans tumbling out of the top 25, making the matchup a battle of two unranked squads. The Cougars, who beat the Trojans last season, remain undefeated despite their unranked status, having blown out their opponents in all three games. The Trojans should be their toughest test so far, but USC’s performances the last two weeks make it hard to be certain.
USC Offense vs. WSU Defense
Deciphering the USC offense after three games this season is a perplexing task. The talent on the field doesn’t match up with the disappointing results it put up over the last two weeks. 
Freshman quarterback JT Daniels has flashed some moments of brilliance, but he’s struggled to get going for the most part after the opener against UNLV. He hasn’t thrown a touchdown since that game; it’s been 89 pass attempts since his last score. 
The inconsistency of the offensive line has played a large role in this. The performance of the line has made Daniels’ job difficult, forcing him to escape the pocket often and draw errant throws. His receiving corps hasn’t been much help either. 
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns has done a good job in the short passing game, with 14 catches for 157 yards, but has yet to make any plays as explosive as those in the 2017 season. Junior receiver Michael Pittman does not look like the player he was at the end of last year and over the offseason, failing to get open consistently and dropping multiple passes. The tight ends have been a total non-factor in the passing game as well, contributing 25 receiving yards between the three of them. 
In fact, the only real weapon for the Trojans’ passing game has been freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. St. Brown has dazzled, racking up 304 receiving yards, adding more than half of those last week as he seemed to be the offense’s only bright spot in the loss to the Longhorns. Although the competition they’ve faced so far hasn’t been elite, the Washington State secondary, led by redshirt sophomore safety Skyler Thomas looks impressive, holding their three opponents to a combined 398 yards passing on sub 50 percent completion while grabbing eight interceptions. 
USC will need its playmakers to step up big to keep the passing game afloat. The ground game hasn’t been any better for the Trojans either. After finishing last weekend’s game with negative rushing yards against a defense that had been ranked 90th in the nation before the game. After doing a solid job for much of the game against Stanford in that department, the offensive line struggled mightily in run-blocking. Perhaps more significantly, USC running backs only took 12 carries the entire night. Fortunately for USC, the Cougars have struggled to defend the run. This game will be a good chance for the Trojans to get their ground game back on track.
WSU Offense vs. USC Defense
The Cougars lost their longtime star quarterback this offseason as Luke Falk made his way to the NFL, leaving graduate student Gardner Minshew to hold the reins of the offense. Minshew has thrown for over 400 yards a game on 70 percent completion with eight touchdowns to boot. He was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week after his performance last Saturday against Eastern Washington in which he exploded for 470 yards passing and two touchdowns. 
Minshew will have plenty of weapons at his disposal, with three receivers averaging more than 60 yards a game and a running back in James Williams with 127 receiving yards on the season. Sophomore wide receiver Davontavean Martin has been dominant as the Cougar’s No. 1 receiver this year, with 290 receiving yards and three touchdowns on 24 catches. The passing attack will provide a tough challenge for a USC defense that got worn down against Texas. The lapses in coverage, lack of pass rush and missed tackles that were prevalent last week cannot show up again if the Trojans want to stop the Washington State offense from going off the way it has thus far. 
Senior outside linebacker Porter Gustin will be unable to play until the second half due to a targeting call against Texas, making it even more imperative for USC to find ways to generate a pass rush. Look for redshirt junior Christian Rector and freshman Kana’I Mauga to be featured heavily off the edge on passing downs. The secondary has been solid for the most part, but redshirt sophomore strong safety CJ Pollard was exposed at times in his first start last week. It’ll be worth noticing how he — or freshman Talanoa Hufanga — performs at that spot. 
The air-raid offense WSU runs places much more emphasis on passing than running, and that has been executing its offense incredibly well so far within those parameters. The Cougars have only rushed the ball 67 times through three games, but don’t sleep on their ability to get things done on the ground, as their running backs have averaged a respectable 4.45 yards per carry and scored.

At the beginning of the football season, I stressed the importance of USC exiting the first three weeks with a 2-1 record. A win over UNLV and either Stanford or Texas would have had multiple benefits. First, and most evident, starting the season with a winning record would do wonders for the team’s morale. Second, it would keep fans interested in the team. That didn’t happen. 
This past week I spoke to many USC fans and the first thing they would say is always a variation of the following: “Why does USC suck? JT Daniels was really a let down.” 
Morale is down — morale of the team, of the campus, of alumni and of fans everywhere. They all share a common denominator: They are not used to USC losing. That’s understandable, as USC is historically one of the most dominant football programs in the country. The team hasn’t ended the season with a losing record since the 2000 season (before the Pete Carroll era). Prior to that, their most recent season below .500 was in 1991. That’s an extremely impressive statistic. Perhaps it can be attributed to the weakness of the Pac-12/10 conference, but regardless, USC does not know how to deal with losing. 
This week’s matchup is important for so many reasons. One, a win over Wazzu will return USC to a .500 record both overall and against Pac-12 competition. Two, Washington State was one of the two teams that ruined USC’s 2017 season, and USC loves sweet revenge. Three, it will show that USC is capable of overcoming an elite offense. 
Washington State currently sits in the No. 2 spot in passing offense behind only Texas Tech. Wazzu averages 10.2 yards per completion and has scored nine passing touchdowns. This sets up an interesting comparison to USC’s passing situation. While the Trojans average 12 yards per completion, they have only scored one passing touchdown (against UNLV) and have produced just 822 passing yards compared to WSU’s 1,263.
Following the Wazzu matchup, USC has some easy competition on the horizon. Its closest matchup will probably be Arizona State. By then, the Trojans should have at least three Pac-12 wins (topping Arizona, Colorado and Utah). Those “easier” matchups should grant USC some time to figure out their offensive struggles before facing the Sun Devils at the end of October. 
At the very least, a loss against the Cougars will further accentuate what USC needs to focus on. The numbers on paper are telling me that the Trojans will lose to the Cougars. USC’s defense doesn’t look like it will be able to contain the Wazzu passing game, especially while missing captain senior linebacker Porter Gustin for the first 30 minutes. Moreover, USC has failed to produce any form of offense in the second half in its last two games. If the Cougars jump on USC early, it would be safe to say that the Trojans won’t be able to bring the game back. 
However, statistics are one-dimensional; they never tell the full story. Did Appalachian State look better on paper than the Michigan Wolverines? Hell no. There are so many factors other than statistics that contribute to a football game, and these innumerable areas are where I think USC will excel. 
Head coach Clay Helton lit a fire under the team at practice this week. On Monday he was livid, screaming for a majority of practice. This team, this coaching staff and this fanbase are mad. My prediction is that USC will come out of the gates guns-a-blazing on Friday. If USC plays mad, like they are tired of losing, they will win this game. 
As my fellow columnist Eric He wrote earlier this week, USC is too talented to play like this. We have seen what happens when the USC passing game gets going against Texas, and we have seen what happens when the “three-headed monster” of running backs get together against Stanford. Moreover, it’s known that USC’s defense has been the one keeping the offense in the game (at least for the first half). USC has the talent — now, it just needs to mesh it all together in one game. The problem is finding the X-factor that will do it for the team, and nothing unites a team more than a hatred of losing.
This week was a short week of practice for both squads, which will benefit the Trojans. Although the common mantra is to put the loss behind and move on to the next week, the Trojans will still have the Texas massacre in the back of their minds come Friday night. If the Trojans play angry and play like they can’t afford another loss, they will leave Week 4 with a .500 record.

When dozens of countries met to compete against each other in the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup in August, four women from USC’s soccer team played under two different flags.
Redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo, freshman forward Penelope Hocking and sophomore forward/defender Tara McKeown competed for the U.S. team at the tournament, hosted in France, which is open to women under the age of 20. Freshman defender Ashley Soto was also called up to play for Mexico’s U-20 National Team.  
For Soto, the strong bond with her teammates at USC helped her develop cohesion with the other players on the national team.
“We really emphasize team building and team unity on the field and off the field,” Soto said. “Especially with the trust, we play as a team. I think that the ‘us’ part really means that we have to trust in each other and the team before other things.”
While neither U.S. nor Mexico won  the trophy, which went to Japan, the Women of Troy said that playing with the U-20 National Team was an unforgettable experience. 
“I was able to play not just 60-minute games — I could play all 90 [minutes], and that was huge for my role with the national team,” DeMelo said. 
Hocking added that she had no idea  she could play for the national team, as her previous experiences have been solely with club soccer.
“Last year in February I got invited and then I did not do well at all,” Hocking said. “Right before I came here I got the opportunity to play again with the national team and that has really prepared me for this, playing in the college level.” 
Playing soccer on two teams is not always easy. To stay on top of their academics, the four athletes focus on time management and utilize mandatory study hours. They have also faced physical challenges from having to practice for the USC team as well as prepare for national competitions. 
DeMelo, who attended the 2016 U-20 World Cup in Papua New Guinea but injured her knee in the months leading up to the tournament, said that she struggled to accept the times she did not achieve the success she aimed for. 
“I knew that going into it I wasn’t going to have a role that I necessarily wanted to, but that I was still part of the team, and I knew that every player on the team counts,” DeMelo said.
They attribute much of their chemistry to head coach Keidane McAlpine’s teaching methods both on and off the field. 
“As much as I push them, I don’t want to be so on top of them that they don’t feel like they can just play,” McAlpine said. “I have to trust them to do their own thing.”
McKeown said that McAlpine’s coaching methods have improved the way she plays. 
“He tells you straight up what you need to be doing to be able to play,” McKeown said. 
Now that the U-20 Women’s World Cup has come to an end, the four athletes are focusing on what’s ahead; playing their best with USC’s soccer team and getting good grades.
“It’s been amazing especially for our whole team this year,” McKeown said. “We are like one unit and working together every day.”

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
On most mornings, my mom would whip up a licuado for my dad. He’d drink it, dressed already in his paint-stained pants, worn-out long sleeve shirt and steel-toed boots. He and I would then head out to his beat-up pickup truck, in which my dad, a construction worker, would drive to work. 
Once in the truck, he’d turn on the ignition and accordion music would blast through the speakers. I would grimace, heavy-eyed, and turn the volume down. 
My dad would listen to norteño artists known for their corridos — as Urban Dictionary defines the music genre, “some real ass music.” In actuality, corridos are songs that narrate the story of a prominent figure from beginning to end. Whether they’re about La Reina del Sur, a notorious female drug lord, or about César Chavez, a prominent labor activist, corridos tell both beautiful and often tragic stories of real-life heroes and villains. 
Norteño bands, which are known for their corridos, began in the area of northern Mexico where my parents grew up before they crossed the border into the United States. The bands tend to be small, featuring a guitarist, an accordionist, a bassist and, in some cases, a saxophone player.
My dad loves norteño music. On our drives, he would jump between everyone from Los Cadetes de Linares and Ramón Ayala to Los Invasores de Nuevo León and Los Tigres del Norte, which became my favorite group. He’d try to whistle along, off tune, and would sometimes belch the lyrics he personally related to.
While as a child the music embarrassed me, as I grew older, I began to appreciate the corridos he would play more and more. Every song told a story, and if I listened intently, I could understand why my dad loved this music so much. 
Despite the lively background music that sets Los Tigres del Norte’s music apart from other ballads, the group is known for telling stories about undocumented immigrants who come into the United States for a better life. In every way, these were the stories of my parents. Established in San José, Calif. where I grew up, this band became famous for telling “las historias de la gente,” (the stories of our people).
In classics like “La Jaula de Oro,” the band poses the question, “¿De qué me sirve el dinero si estoy como prisionero dentro de esta gran nación?” (What’s the point of money, if I’m a prisoner in this grand nation?)  The song describes the story of a man who feels trapped in the United States in a “golden cage” — his kids deny their Mexican heritage and don’t speak Spanish, he can’t return to Mexico and he can’t even try to become a citizen because of the harsh and outdated immigration laws. Aside from his son denying his Mexican heritage, this song was about my dad.
Mi papá would sometimes wipe a tear as he drove his truck, listening to these tunes. He, too, was in a similar situation, stuck in a country he chose to immigrate to over 20 years ago with no way of returning to his México lindo. He’d wake up early every morning to work at an arduous job that paid him much less than what he was worth because to the United States los mexicanos les valemos madre. (Honestly, how do I even translate that?)
Los Tigres follow a similar narrative in their song “El Emigrante” as well. “Soy emigrante como extraño a mi pais, a mis hijos y hermanos, a mi madre idolatrada,” the group sings. (I’m an immigrant like a stranger to my land, to my children and brothers and to my idolized mother.) The tune, accompanied by a somber accordion and guitar, tells the story of a man in the U.S. stuck far away from his home country and away from his ailing mother. Again, this story is about my dad.
When my abuelita Rosita passed away four years ago, my dad and his seven siblings gathered around a laptop to watch her funeral through a Skype call from California. None of them were able to say goodbye in person before her passing because they were stuck here. If any decided to make the trip, they would be unable to return.
They spent all day, despite their often-machista personalities, solemnly peering at a damned screen with their late mother displayed. 
In so many ways, the songs by Los Tigres parallel my father’s heartbreaking immigrant experience, one that is all-too-familiar to undocumented people. 
Los Tigres provide relatability many artists can’t achieve. While I am a natural-born U.S. citizen and did not face the same experiences as others who relate to the band’s most popular songs, their messages have brought me closer to my father. They’ve allowed me to empathize with his struggles and made me grateful for the opportunities I only have because he left Mexico. 
While I’m away at college, I sometimes blast the accordion-filled corridos from my own speakers and remember the times I complained when “Contrabando y Traición” played in my dad’s truck. As I listen, I’m reminded of my father’s sweat, tears and sacrifice and moved by the fact that all of it has been for me.

Having collaborated with artists like Major Lazer on hits like “Lean On,” electriconic pop artist MØ performed at the El Rey Theatre on Tuesday night as a solo act, never sacrificing danceability in the process. (Photo courtesy of Aamir Khuller)
MØ is an artist whose name is not as widely recognized as her voice, which has been featured on several chart-topping EDM tracks. Particularly popular are her collaborations with Major Lazer, the trio behind songs like “Cold Water” and “Lean On.” Known mostly for her collaborations with DJs, the Danish singer had a lot to prove as a solo performer. Ultimately, the performance quickly resolved any worries one might have about her live abilities.
El Rey was the perfect venue for MØ to perform. Built in the 1930s as a movie theater, the current live music venue stands out on Wilshire Boulevard. The interior features a large balcony, stunning red curtains and twinkling chandeliers. The ambient purple lighting shining throughout the venue created an atmosphere that reflected MØ’s unconventional aura. Though the venue itself was quite spacious, the tightly packed dance floor made for an overall intimate experience.
The demographic of the crowd  was rather surprising; despite her appeal to a younger audience of electropop fans, her concert drew audiences of all ages. From teenagers to older couples, the entire crowd was buzzing in anticipation before her set began. This age-diverse crowd underscored MØ’s ability to make electropop, and electronic music in general, more accessible to a wide range of audiences. As soon as she stepped on stage, the crowd started dancing and didn’t stop until the show ended. 
MØ’s dramatic entrance to the stage was completely blacked out. Within a few seconds, the stage went from complete emptiness to MØ standing center stage, surrounded by her instrumentalists. Their unique fashion sense immediately stood out and matched the idiosyncratic performance to come. Her musicians’ outfits slightly resembled MØ’s usual punk look, but the singer herself went for a more athletic outfit to complement an hour of dancing. 
Her youthful, carefree energy, dramatic prancing and dance-like-nobody-is-watching attitude permeated the room and left little room for self-consciousness among audience members. Captivated by her enthusiasm, the audience reciprocated her high level of energy. This was immediately clear with her second song of the night, “Nights with You.” As one of her most popular tracks, the entire crowd was passionately singing and dancing along early in the set. On many occasions, MØ ran into the crowd to dance with her fans and reinforce the unifying nature of electronic music. Combined with the visually stunning lights display perfectly synced to her production, MØ created an invigorating environment. During her performance of “Kamikaze,” the vibrant lighting enhanced the complex production.
MØ’s live show went far beyond her music. She quickly overcame any skepticism as to how she would recreate the groovy atmosphere her music provides but without any post-production mixing. The artist cultivated a truly interactive and lively experience that brings fans both young and old out of their shell. For those who enjoy carefree dancing in a crowd full of like-minded individuals, MØ is a can’t-miss opportunity.

For nearly 100 years, the Greek Theatre has hosted some of the most legendary artists in music history, and on Wednesday night, a modest singer by the name Miguel added his name to that lengthy list. (Kenan Draughorne | Daily Trojan)
Serenading a sold-out crowd for two hours on a crisp September night, the artist was in top form as he ran through hits both old and new, taking the time to interact with the crowd and provide backstories to some of his most popular songs. 
The duality found in much of Miguel’s catalogue was strong throughout the night. One moment, he was the noble preacher spreading messages of unity and offering words of motivation; the next, he was the mischievous devil backed by sensual projections and gyrating dancers. 
Miguel fit both personalities into his recent hit “Come Through and Chill,” as he introduced it with an extended monologue about the grueling process of creating the track with Salaam Remi, and how it reminded him of the importance of pushing through whatever roadblocks are in one’s path. By the end of the song, however, he was leading the crowd in a call and response chant of “I want to f*ck all night,” before jokingly chastising the audience for “being too nasty.” 
There was a time when the “Sky Walker” singer was marketed as the next rising R&B crooner, sliding into the hearts of listeners across the country with soulful ballads such as “Adorn” and “How Many Drinks.” Watching him headbang to electric guitars and rousing drums from atop his white staircase was enthralling; however, it is all too easy to forget such a moment existed. Even when he played his slower songs on Wednesday night, many of them received the rock ‘n’ roll treatment with a more aggressive soundscape, as he added a fiery energy through his movements as well.
Before Miguel took the stage,  R&B duo Dvsn stuck to a smoother, softer aura during their set. Kicking off their time with their sparse, downtempo song “Too Deep,” they were supported by a trio of singers dressed in all black who fostered the passionate vocals from lead singer Daniel Daley. 
While the opener’s low-energy setlist made for a relatively dull atmosphere compared to the night’s headliner, Daley certainly pulled out all the stops to resonate with the crowd, dropping to his knees as he belted out the high notes during their final song.
While Daley had to go the extra mile to solidify that crowd, Miguel’s set felt virtually effortless. At one point looking to unearth the true, original “Wildhearts” in the venue, he ran through a montage of his earlier songs, challenging the audience to sing the lyrics themselves. When met with whispered attempts and nervous laughter, he was unfazed; he eventually moved on to a different song and attempted the same strategy. 
Over time, though, the songs became more familiar: Loud cheers erupted when he launched into “Quickie,” while over half of the crowd sang along with “Vixen” at the top of their lungs. 
His faultless stage presence was the true star of the evening; he was captivating to watch throughout his allotted time. Even when some of the crowd rested in their seats during lesser-known songs, he was just as animated, maintaining a veteran swagger with the hunger of an artist getting his first major look. After attempting to end the show with “Sky Walker,” continued cheers from the crowd drew him out for an encore, compelling him to perform “P-ssy is Mine” for his dedicated fans. 
Not every artist is able to hold their own through such a lengthy set. But for an artist like Miguel, this talent was never in question.

The social calendar app, Toga, abruptly shut down in May after a failed acquisition process. Marshall alumnus Noah Johnson co-founded the app in 2015. (Photo courtesy of Noah Johnson)
Upon returning to USC this fall, upperclassmen may have noticed that Toga, a social calendar app, was missing.
Toga, which launched in 2015, was an app that displayed events, ranging from house parties to concerts at Shrine Auditorium, happening on or near USC’s campus.
Toga’s sudden disappearance was a source of mystery to students. A simple message appearing on the application and through emails announced its shutdown in May. 
“On May 15th, Toga will be shutting down. But … as one chapter closes, a new one opens!” the message read.
Noah Johnson, a Toga co-founder and alumnus of the Marshall School of Business, explained that Toga shut down due to a failed acquisition. 
“The abruptness came about due to an acquisition process, where a larger company was going to acquire us, but in the 11th hour, [the acquisition] fell through,” Johnson said.
Before the failed acquisition, Toga provided students with a shared platform on which all social events on or around campus were posted.
Its shutdown disappointing for many students, including Isabella Smith, a senior majoring in industrial systems engineering. 
“It becomes a little more exclusive at USC when there’s not something that’s open to everyone to see where all the [events] are,” Smith said. 
While larger events were added by the Toga staff themselves, students had the ability to broadcast their personal functions to all of campus, almost as a form of advertising to the student population. This ensured larger turnouts to organizations and social events, such as fraternity-affiliated parties.
“Back when I was a freshman, ultimately, it was difficult to find all of the events happening on campus,” Johnson said. “I built Toga to solve that [issue].” 
Toga’s initial development included multiple iterations of the application, with the initial launching solely at USC. As the app received funding, its reach expanded to over 38 campuses and thousands of users. 
The app itself was socially oriented, showing friends from connected social media accounts who were interested in the same events as the user. 
Toga also offered a unique experience which allowed the user to “peek” onto other campuses, giving an insight into many universities’ specific student cultures and their events.
While many students may be disappointed by Toga’s shutdown, some students found that the app could be a nuisance because of how easily someone could post an event for the entire campus, even if they were not the function’s coordinator.
“I lived in a pretty big house on the corner of Menlo [Avenue], and parties, which were private Facebook events, on two separate occasions, were put on Toga,” said Justin Rankin, a senior majoring in industrial systems engineering. “We ended up entertaining a large amount of people we did not know.” 
Rankin’s experience seems to be in the minority, with many upset by the app removal. 
“One of the biggest things [I see] when I look at the whole journey is ultimately perseverance, you learn from your mistakes and you keep building,” Johnson said.

When Logan Nelson, a senior music student, got a call from the producer of the World Soundtrack Awards saying that he’d been selected as a finalist for the Best Young International Composer, he was shocked. 
To enter the World Soundtrack Awards, a subsection of the Ghent Film Festival, Nelson submitted an original score for a full orchestra set to a clip of Hayao Miyazaki’s film “Grave of the Fireflies.” Nelson wanted to enter the competition because of his interest in writing for orchestras and love for Miyazaki’s animation. 
On Oct. 17, Nelson will travel to Ghent, Belgium to perform his score with a live orchestra while the clip from the movie plays in the background.
“I did not expect to win [the competition] but I’m really glad I did,” Nelson said.
Although the score is finished and most of the work has been completed, Nelson is still actively preparing for his performance at the awards show next month. For a live performance set to a picture to run smoothly, each instrumentalist must stay on track. 
“The [musicians] have a click in their headphones so everybody’s in time, so I have to … prepare the click track for them,” Nelson said. “I’ve been talking with [the conductor, the Director of the Brussels Philharmonic,] about the intentions I have [for] the piece.”
Learning to play the piano and violin, studying music theory and listening to his parents’ collection of soundtracks in his middle school years transformed Nelson. His love for films, along with his musical background, helped him realize that he wanted to compose soundtracks. He draws stylistic inspiration for his projects from Hans Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch, two composers who combine orchestral music with electronic elements. 
Ted Hearne, Nelson’s private instructor since his freshman year, said he’s thrilled to see his student grow, improve in his craft and receive due recognition by being selected as a finalist for the awards. 
“I know him as a composer who showed a lot of promise, who’s always asking the hard questions about what it means to be a musician and really looking at opportunities to meld genres, to think about hybridization in music,” Hearne said. “He’s been working to find ways to combine all of his different influences into something cohesive and expressive.”
Nelson said he has worked on many projects that blend music with visual media. One of his favorite collaborations, entitled “The Goh Ballet,” was produced with longtime friend Lukas Dong, a senior majoring in film production. Logan said he values artistic collaboration and appreciated the opportunity to work alongside his friend.
“Collaboration is what I live [for] … I like to collaborate on everything just because life is so boring without [it],” Nelson said.
Dong said he was excited for his friend’s nomination and he hopes to accompany Nelson to Belgium for his performance. 
“[The nomination] feels so big it doesn’t really [sink] in,” Dong said. “The vibe I get is that he’s extremely well-skilled and that he understands how to execute the music he’s doing very well. It’s just like a second language to him.”
While he’s worked on personal and school-related projects with film students, Nelson has also assisted composers for TV shows such as Netflix’s “Dear White People” and ABC’s “For the People.” He is currently running the music department for sci-fi TV show “Skyvault,” which will be pitched to Netflix. He’s also working on a film called “Lullabye” for submission to the Cannes Film Festival. 
Nelson plans to work on bigger projects after graduation, whether they entail making soundtracks for films or composing orchestral music. 
“[It’s about] developing my own sound, my own voice, and working with my own directors and through those relationships eventually … [being] able to do this for a living,” Nelson said.

Jennifer Palmieri, former White House communications director, spoke at Annenberg’s “Special Event for Women Who Will Run the World” on Thursday. (Gabi Thur de Koos | Daily Trojan)
Starting the event with an emotional metaphor about swimming in water, Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and former White House communications director in the Obama administration, described what it was like to realize that she was “living in a world run by men.” 
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted Palmieri for the “Special Event for Women Who Will Run the World” Thursday evening at the Wallis Annenberg Auditorium.
“I think that the amount of change that’s happening in the world is pretty revolutionary and we can’t talk about how we communicate around that without grasping the kind of change we are going through,” Palmieri began.
Palmieri believes that men do not necessarily hold women back, but power systems benefit men and “hold women back.” She explained that the summer of 2015 through the months leading up to the 2016 election made this clear to her.
“It was really hard … there was so much vitriol and I tried to wrap my head around, like what is it? Why do people hate her so much?” Palmieri said.
This revelation between the “seeds” of her book “Dear Madam President,” which she said she wrote as an open letter of empowerment to the first female president of the United States. She wrote it with the intent to inspire women who are going to “run the world.”
“My book in one sentence is that people take their cue from you,” Palmieri said. “If you act like you belong in the room, people think you do.” 
Palmieri said that there is no right answer concerning the responsibility of the president, but that people should be using their voice.
“If you’re not speaking up, you’re not doing your job,” she said.
Palmieri argued that the reason people were uncomfortable with Clinton was because she stepped out and did things most women held back from at the time. Generally, society has not accepted women who defy gender roles, Palmieri said.
“People think if you have ambition that’s all you have as a woman,” she said, pointing out that it was no surprise that people were against a woman coming into power. She explains that Clinton was “being forced into a world that wasn’t made for her.” 
Looking back, when Clinton first decided to run for president, Palmieri said she worried that the candidate could not give a unique story. 
“What matters is the credibility, the authenticity, and the conviction of the person speaking,” Palmieri said. “As communicators, that’s the best thing that we can provide.” 
What excites and motivates Palmieri is the time of change the world is currently experiencing.
The event was then moderated by Christina Bellantoni, director of the Annenberg Media Center. Bellantoni has covered the White House, Congress and three presidential campaigns throughout her journalism career before coming to Annenberg. 
Palmieri also explained that she wrote her book during the period when President Donald Trump began to act on many of his campaign promises, such as repealing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. This time of extreme political unrest inspired her to speak to the women of America in hopes that the country still has a bright future.
“I need the press to unearth something I don’t know about … or shine a light on an injustice,” Palmieri said. She argued that the press should be a tool for more than just a collection of occurrences, which can be found on social media.
Maggie Horne, a freshman majoring in law, history and culture, attended the event for one of her classes and said that Palmieri’s talk inspired her.
“I’m interested in politics so I wanted to hear what she [Palmieri] had to say,” Horne said. “I want to be a lawyer when I’m older and that’s a field women are getting more into now. I liked hearing how she was saying that women need to not be afraid to get their voice out there.”
