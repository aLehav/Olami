Student organizations will participate in the Global Day of Action on Sunday as part of an effort to eliminate coal usage as the primary source of power and promote new methods of renewable energy, club representatives said.
The Beyond Coal Campaign, which is part of the Sierra Club on campus, focuses on increasing visibility of efforts to find alternative uses of reusable energy to the university and greater Los Angeles area, said Rosalie Murphy, a freshman majoring in history and media coordinator for the campaign.
“We get more power from coal, which is a major contributor to public health problems and global warming, than from any other power source at USC,” Murphy said.
Other organizations in Los Angeles are also holding events to raise awareness for this cause. Several groups, including Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, are joining together to host a gathering Downtown on Sunday.
Los Angeles currently obtains about 39 percent of its overall power from coal plants, Murphy said. The Global Day of Action aims to raise awareness of how members of the community can erase this usage all together.
“By the end of the semester, we hope to meet with President [C.L. Max] Nikias to get a serious commitment and set up an action plan for making USC a coal-free institution,” Murphy said. “As a private school, we have the resources to pursue that goal, and we can end up being a huge player in the city of L.A. in terms of renewable energy.”
The Global Day of Action will give people an opportunity to be active against worldwide climate change, said David Caso, the assistant press secretary of the Sierra Club of Los Angeles.
“We are urging leadership to advocate getting out of the coal plants. Students at USC have the power to combat our dependency upon them,” Caso said.
Other U.S. universities, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Ball State University, have already been successful in completely eradicating coal plants as their main source of power, Caso said.
The Beyond Coal Campaign has been gathering signatures from students on campus to raise awareness and help it achieve its goals, Murphy said.
So far, the campaign has obtained about 1,000 signatures and collected 100 photo petitions to submit to university officials, Murphy said. The organization is also hoping to host a panel of clean energy experts for an open discussion on campus sometime in late October or early November.
Danielle Barrett, a junior majoring in political science, said she believes the campaign is helping push the university in a positive direction.
“Any attempt to break away from our dependency on coal as a primary source of energy is admirable,” Barrett said. “We have to realize that the issue of clean energy is something that will have a major impact on our generation down the road.”
The Global Day of Action in Los Angeles will kick off at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, with a rally on the South Lawn in front of City Hall, on First Avenue between Main and North Spring streets.
“We want to plug into the city in a wider way than just within the walls of campus, and this event gives students the opportunity to do just that,” Murphy said.
Its excellent to see the student body coming together for something so important to our planets future.  There’s no reason for USC to rely on imported coal; we could kick the habit in the next 5 years if we formulate our plan now.  Transitioning into greener technology will help save our planet and help save our school money.
Kind of funny that the groups that have stood in the way of safe and clean nuclear energy are the ones protesting the use of coal.  As they say in France, if you don’t like nuclear power, unplug your refrigerator.
coal does not cause global warming or anything else on earth for whatever.. It’s a total fraud that has been completely debunked by now.  They call it climate change now in case you hadn’t noticed..  It’s an excuse to levy new punishing taxes and other political garbage.. 
This global warming scam is one of the reasons the state of California is falling apart with all the of the jobs we have lost for no good reason.

The USC men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams return to the pool today at noon as they host San Diego and Cal State Bakersfield for the USC Invitational.
The event, which will be held at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, will be the first meet of the year for the men’s side as it looks to build on an 11th-place performance in last year’s NCAAs.
Back for more - Senior captain Presley Bard helped lead the Women of Troy to a victory last weekend against Oregon State. USC will now face both San Diego and Cal State Bakersfield in the USC Invitational this weekend. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy, meanwhile, are coming off a 141–112 victory over Oregon State last weekend. Senior co-captains Presley Bard and Lyndsay DePaul and junior Katinka Hosszu led the team to its first Pac-10 win of the season, but it was a duo of freshmen who continues to impress.
“Kasey Carlson and Meghan Hawthorne are outstanding athletes who really should help to put us over the top where we certainly should get a chance to be in the top four at the NCAAs,” USC coach Dave Salo said.
DePaul further emphasized the impact the freshmen have already had on this young season.
“Our freshman have been really impressive,” DePaul said. “We’re excited to see what they can do for the rest of the season.”
For the men, Salo believes the strength of their roster should propel the Trojans to victory.
“Bakersfield always has a handful of guys who are pretty good, but they don’t have the depth we have. We should be able to take them,” Salo said.
The men’s team returns sophomore Clement Lefert, the team’s top NCAA performer last season. Other veterans include All-Americans junior Patrick White and sophomore Nick Karpov as well as co-captains senior Emmett Walling and junior Jeff Daniels.
The squad is bolstered by incoming freshmen Chase Bloch, Jack Wagner, and Vladimir Morozov. All three are among the nation’s top newcomers.
Though today’s meet offers the Trojans an opportunity to test their skills against a live opponent, Salo said he views this as an opportunity to prepare for an important matchup later in the season.
“We try to focus a lot in the fall on our competition against Arizona. They’re really good at their starts and their first 15 meters of every race, so I keep harping on our athletes that we have to be better on our first 15 meters,” Salo said. “A lot of what we’re gearing towards is the Arizona competition in November. If we have a really super meet right there, it will really set the tone for the rest of the season.”

It’s quite the bang to open the conference schedule with.
Pac-10 play begins for the No. 20-ranked Women of Troy (7-2-2) tonight at 7 p.m. at the Coliseum against No. 1 Stanford (9-0-2), and continues Sunday at 1 p.m. at McAlister Field against No. 21 Cal (6-1-4).

“It is the most important part of the season,” senior forward Megan Ohai said. “Teams refuse to lose in conference play.”
But because of that, Ohai said she believes the team is even more prepared for the looming challenge.
“I think that we’re ready,” Ohai said. “Stanford is a big game. We’re at the Coliseum, they’re No. 1, it’s our first Pac-10 game and we’re coming off a tough loss. So it’s a lot, but I think that because of all that we’ll be especially motivated.”
Motivation and focus, especially early in games, have been recurring issues for the team this year. USC has conceded the first goal in five of its 11 games, including one in the second minute to Eastern Washington.
“We’ve been starting all of our games real slowly, digging ourselves a hole,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We had been able to climb out of them, but you can’t force yourself to keep on doing that. And, finally, we weren’t able to climb out [against San Diego].”
Last weekend the Women of Troy failed to avenge a season opening 1-0 loss to San Diego, falling again to the Toreros by the same score. The Toreros found the back of the net in the 34th minute last weekend. It was the third first-half goal allowed by USC in the last three games, although the Women of Troy had been able to come back and win the previous two.
“We need to start harder, read the game more and be ready to go from the beginning,” Ohai said.
Freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano agreed.
“Starting off strong has been the focus this whole week,” freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano said. “I think we’ll be pumped. Pac-10 opener, at the Coliseum, No. 1 Stanford — it’s exciting.”
Exciting, however, might not be the word Khosroshahin would use to describe Pac-10 play.
“It is the toughest conference in the country in every sport, including women’s soccer,” Khosroshahin said. “If the ladies thought that San Diego was fired up to play them, wait for Stanford and Cal.”
Ohai said her team was ready for the challenges ahead.
“Preseason is over,” Ohai said. “That doesn’t matter anymore. Playing in conference is the most important part of the season.”
The Women of Troy are a combined 15-8-4 in conference during Khosroshahin’s three years at the helm, including 6-2-1 in 2007, when they won the national championship.
But no USC team has ever won the Pac-10 outright.
To do that, Khosroshahin said his young team — which includes nine freshman and just three seniors — needs to be more consistent.
“When a team lacks maturity, consistency is the first thing to go,” Khosroshahin said. “And we’re really getting thrown into the fire. So what a great opportunity to put a young group against two nationally ranked opponents and find out what we’re all about.”
Despite the team’s youth, its objective is clear.
“Our goal is to win the Pac-10,” Khosroshahin said. “It always is.”

The No. 8 USC women’s volleyball team is 13-1, but with a recent loss to Washington still in the back of the players’ minds, they are more determined than ever to have two strong matches this weekend.
That will not necessarily be easy, as the Women of Troy will host two undefeated teams at the Galen Center. They face No. 1 Stanford tonight at 7 p.m. before playing No. 7 California at the same time on Saturday.
Distinguished - Senior outside hitter Geena Urango and the Women of Troy have enjoyed a 13-1 season so far, but their talents will be put to the test this weekend at the Galen Center as they face two higher-ranked teams. - TIm Tran | Daily Trojan 
Despite the high level of competition the team will face, the Women of Troy have focused on their own game, rather than on the skills of their opponents.
“We just want to reinforce the things we do well and kind of work on the things that we haven’t done so well and make sure that we get good concentration the whole week,” USC coach Mick Haley said.
In tonight’s match, the Women of Troy will have to try and contain Stanford outside hitter Alix Klineman, who already has 239 kills this season. USC has lost five-straight matches to the Cardinal and is hoping to break that trend.
“We’re really pretty evenly matched,” Haley said. “I think they’re playing the game a little bit better than we are right now, so we need to step up in that regard.”
In terms of Saturday’s matchup against Cal, when asked about the Bears’ play, Haley did not have much to say about the team’s make-up — except to classify the Golden Bears as “strange” — but praised them for their abilities.
“The combination of kids they have makes for them to have a very nice team, and I think we need to find out what they’re all about,” Haley said.
In a conference that is stacked with six ranked teams, this weekend is just one of many that will have the Women of Troy playing multiple competitive matches — a difficult task, especially for a team that currently has six freshmen seeing playing time.
Despite the conference grind, Haley does not seem too concerned about his team’s focus.
“This team seems to still be having fun. They like to get up there and battle every day in practice with each other, so I think we’re in good shape,” Haley said. “I think the motivation to win every match is where we’re at.”
In preparing for this weekend, as well as for the rest of the season, Haley stressed how the team is mainly focused on improving in areas such as blocking and returning serves while at the same time maintaining its strengths.
“Our ace to error ratio is very good with our serving,” Haley said. “So if we can keep that right there and not let the intensity of the matches bother that, then we’re going to win, or we’re going to play as good as we can play, and that should give us a chance to win.”

Gen. George S. Patton, who led U.S. forces during World War II, experienced some crushing defeats in his career. His ability to recover after a loss, however, made him an icon of military leadership.
“Success is how high you bounce after you hit the bottom,” Patton once said.
During the last nine years, USC built a football dynasty on a similar principle.
The Trojans haven’t lost two games in a row since 2001, when they fell to Stanford and Washington in consecutive weeks. Sound familiar?
USC heads into Saturday’s game unranked and reeling from last week’s upset at the hands of the Washington Huskies.
Now, the Trojans will head north to take on No. 16 Stanford, a team that handed them an embarrassing 55-21 loss on Homecoming last year.
This looks to be a bad matchup for the Trojans. USC’s pass defense, ranked 116th in the nation out of 120 teams, will square off against Cardinal quarterback Andrew Luck, who leads the conference in total offense.
A year ago, the Trojans struggled against Stanford’s physical style of play, surrendering 325 rushing yards and five touchdowns on the ground.
Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart is gone from the Cardinal backfield, but Stanford still ranks 23rd in the nation in rushing.
Add to that the Trojans’ struggles with penalties and special teams in recent weeks, and the situation appears bleak for the former kings of the Pac-10.
The Las Vegas odds makers list Stanford as 10-point favorites, a far cry from three years ago when the Cardinal entered the Coliseum as 41-point underdogs.
A USC loss this weekend wouldn’t come as a shock to most.
The excuses are readily available and, in many ways, valid: NCAA sanctions that removed the possibility of a bowl game, transfers and scholarship reductions that limit the team’s depth, a new head coach implementing his schemes and his way of doing things, and a particularly difficult batch of Pac-10 opponents.
The belief in some circles is that, with no bowl game to play for, this USC team could fade down the stretch against a string of talented conference foes.
Stewart Mandel of Sports Illustrated wrote this week that “in the increasingly deep and quarterback-heavy Pac-10 … USC will finish no higher than seventh.”
Saturday’s game, then, represents more than a midseason showdown between two conference rivals.
This is an opportunity for the 2010 Trojans to define themselves.
A victory this Saturday in Palo Alto would send a message to the rest of the conference that, although USC football is down, it’s definitely not out.
A triumph over a ranked foe would show the nation that, despite the sanctions, this season still means something to this squad.
A win on the road could refuel the Trojans with a belief that, no matter how difficult their schedule might be, they still have the talent to play with anyone in the country.
Because if not now, then when?
The schedule doesn’t get any easier after Saturday. Although the Trojans return home next week to begin a three-game homestand, the Coliseum is no longer a place feared by opponents.
Home losses to Stanford, Arizona and Washington in the last two years have removed some of the stadium’s mystique.
Of the Trojans’ seven remaining games, none can be considered an automatic “W.” Even UCLA, which got off to a rough start, has won three straight games, including two over then-top-25 teams.
With no let-up in sight, a loss this weekend could send the Trojans into a tailspin.
A losing record, a finish in the bottom half of the conference, the unofficial end to a dynasty — these all have the potential of being the story of this year’s team.
Like the famous Dylan Thomas poem, the message to USC is one of seizing the moment: “Do not go gentle into that good night / Rage, rage against the dying of the light.”
The Trojans could go down as a team that just had too much to overcome.
Or, like Patton, they could bounce back.

For those who have the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (15-0) on upset alert in this Saturday’s 3 p.m. match against No. 6 Stanford (6-4), be forewarned that coach Jovan Vavic has already beaten you to the punch.
Holding his weight · Freshman driver Nikola Vavic is only in his first season at USC but has already become a major part of the Trojan offense. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
Concerned that midterms and 15 consecutive wins to open the season might portend a lackluster effort against the Cardinal, Vavic held a meeting with his young team this week in hopes of maintaining its focus.
“[Vavic] warned us of a possible letdown, and we understand the risk, but we’re all as motivated as ever,” redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal said. “We know that, even though we are the No. 1 team, people still probably don’t give us as much respect as we think we deserve. With that in mind, I think we’ll continue our streak.”
Although the Trojans boast a 17-game win streak against the Cardinal entering this Mountain Pacific Sports Federation clash at the Avery Aquatic Complex, Vavic believes Stanford’s physicality and star two-meter players will challenge his team.
“I think they’re going to try to set the tempo with lots of physical play early. Because we have a young team, they’ll probably want to see how we’ll respond to a physical type of game,” Vavic said. “We have to be prepared for the two big, strong two-meter men they have, and they have three or four very good outside shooters.”
The two-meters to whom Vavic referred are senior Jeffrey Schwimer and junior Peter Sefton, whom Stanford will utilize to run post-ups and distribute the ball to its talented shooters. Another player the Trojans must contain is junior driver Jacob Smith, the Cardinal’s leading scorer with 24 goals on the season.
Fortunately for USC, it has prepared for Stanford two weeks in a row, as the Trojans expected to face the Cardinal in the SoCal Tournament on Oct. 3. The Cardinal, however, were upset in the second round by UC Santa Barbara.
Game planning and advanced scouting aside, if the Trojans execute their offense and disrupt the Cardinal’s set offensive plays, the team will keep its sterling undefeated record intact. Ultimately, the Trojans’ objective to convert the preseason skeptics — however few remain — will not allow their focus to wander.
“With certain inexperienced teams you might have a letdown, with everyone thinking no one can stop us. But we’ve had a chip on our shoulder since the preseason when everyone counted us out,” junior two-meter Matthew Burton said. “We want to go all the way. We want to make sure that every team we play fears us.”

The last time USC faced Stanford, former running back Toby Gerhart ran through, around and over the Trojan defense, which powered the Cardinal to a 55-21 victory at the Coliseum.
Defining moment · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and the Trojans face Stanford with the possibility of losing two consecutive games for the first time since 2001. Although the Cardinal is favored to win, USC won the last meeting in Palo Alto. - Jesse Bowman | Daily Trojan 
After failing to avenge last year’s loss against Washington last week, USC hopes it can turn its fortunes around and redeem itself on the road against No. 16 Stanford on Saturday.
“Every game that you lose, you come back with the mentality of payback time,” junior defensive tackle Jurrell Casey said. “This whole week, everybody worked hard and was focused, so we’ll be prepared to play.”
Gerhart won’t be around this time, but that doesn’t mean Stanford has gone away from its bruising, grind-it-out style of play.
“We’re going to have to play physical because these guys are as physical as they come in all three areas of the game,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “They’re going to attack you on offense — the quarterback is extremely good — and on defense they’re playing way better than they were a year ago. Their special teams are extremely sound and physical, so this will be a good matchup for us.”
Offensively, Stanford is led by running back Stepfan Taylor and quarterback Andrew Luck, who could present problems for the Trojans defense.
As a dual-threat quarterback, the Trojans are all too familiar with players that can pass and run, such as Washington’s quarterback Jake Locker last weekend.
“They’re a similar type of quarterback, but when Luck scrambles, we got to make sure we stay on our guy,” sophomore safety T.J. McDonald said. “[Luck] can scramble, keep his head up and throw the ball, so we’re going to have our hands full this weekend.”
To make things even more difficult, Stanford’s offensive line has only allowed two sacks in five games this year.
“It’s tough to win one-on-one matchups because their offensive line is as good as anybody’s in the country,” Kiffin said. “They don’t let you get to the quarterback very often because they’re very sound. The key is … somehow, we got to find a way to stop them on third downs. They’re No. 2 in the country on third-down conversions, so we’re going to have our hands full on defense.”
Though the Trojans will be challenged defensively, they will also need to find a way to string together some consistency on offense.
The Trojans were given many opportunities to score against Washington last weekend but often settled for field goals or failed to convert.
But if the Trojans are engaged in a close game like they were against Washington, the coaching staff hopes they’ll be able to convert on their offensive opportunities in the red zone. 
“Matt looked good [in practice] this week,” Kiffin said. “If we have a shot again like last week, we’ll finish them off and he can make that next step from being a good quarterback to a great quarterback.”
In recent games, the Trojans have also employed the Wildcat formation to try and give defenses different looks, and in practice this week, freshman running back Dillon Baxter was utilized in that role, which could be used against the Cardinal.
“The Wildcat is in our game plan this weekend,” Baxter said. “We worked on it enough and we should be able to execute.”
Though payback is in mind, the Trojans must play sound football both offensively and defensively to have a shot at winning, but the team is sure of itself going into the weekend.
“You have to be confident,” Casey said. “If you’re not confident, there’s no point in playing football. Every week, we got to come out with the mindset that we’re going to win.”

During the last 30 years in American cinema, one recurrent theme has stood out more than the rest: The teenage experience is often harsh, but a necessary rite of passage. The turbulent emotions and relationships that pervade a teenager’s life appeared in films prior to the 1980s, but it was filmmaker John Hughes that perfectly rendered teenage angst into cinematic form with classics such as The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink.
Head cases · Kier Gilchrist (left) stars as Craig, a teenager overwhelmed by all of life’s challenges who checks himself into a mental institution, alongside veteran actors Jeremy Davies (right) and Viola Davis. - Photo courtesy of Focus Features 
Hughes’ influence still lives today, apparent in the newest addition to the teen genre, It’s Kind of a Funny Story, which salutes the work of the late Hughes as it also attempts to push the genre boldly forward into unknown cinematic territory.
In an interview conducted earlier this year, producer Kevin Misher described the film’s concept as “a teen version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” With Focus Features attached to the project — the company behind such groundbreaking films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich — viewers cannot be faulted for seeing Focus Features’ most recent release with the hopes of witnessing the same biting social commentary and meticulous acting that made Cuckoo’s Nest immortal.
Indeed, the filmmakers must be applauded for their uninhibited ambition. Unfortunately, ambition doesn’t guarantee results and, consequently, the only characteristic that It’s Kind of a Funny Story shares with the Best Picture winner is the psychiatric ward setting.
Depressed 16-year old Craig (played by Keir Gilchrist with predictably generous doses of glum and morose) is completely overwhelmed by the chaotic merry-go-round of homework, girls, pushy parents and college applications that make up his daily life as a high school student in Brooklyn.
After entertaining thoughts of suicide, Craig commits himself to Argenon Hospital’s psychiatric ward, where he is transferred to live with the adult patients while renovations are made to the youth ward. During his minimum-length five-day stay, Craig cultivates friendships, realizes important life lessons and develops a romance with another teen patient, Noelle, portrayed with equal amounts of spunk and insecurity by Julia Roberts’ niece, Emma Roberts.
It’s Kind of a Funny Story’s main draw is the welcome dramatic turn for bearded funnyman Zach Galifianakis. After his career caught fire with his genius performance as the eccentric brother-in-law-to-be Alan in The Hangover, the comedian added another dimension to his talent when he accepted the challenge of playing against type in It’s Kind of a Funny Story.
With a slight wink to Jack Nicholson’s anarchic Randle McMurphy in Cuckoo’s Nest, Galifianakis’ character, Bobby, is a rebellious adult patient who takes the young Craig under his wing and teaches him the ins and outs of the ward. Galifianakis’ oddball quirks that made Alan so endearing are also present in Bobby. During one sequence in which the hospital patients perform their own rendition of the rock ballad “Under Pressure,” the image of Galifianakis, decked out in a David Bowie costume complete with a glitter-speckled beard, provides sheer comic enjoyment.
Yet, filmmakers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck seem to be cautious with his dramatic scenes. Bobby’s soul-bearing moments seem to be as brief as possible, almost as if the directors were afraid that audiences will not be convinced by Galifianakis’ performance. This tactic would be understandable for first-time directors; however Boden and Fleck have already proved their sophistication in directing actors with 2006’s Half Nelson, in which Ryan Gosling received an Oscar nomination for his performance as an inner-city teacher.
Bogged down by sensitive material, few jokes that actually work and the filmmakers’ apprehension to allow the film to transition into dramatic moments, It’s Kind of a Funny Story simply cannot decide what kind of film it wants to be.
Galifianakis’ brief but heart-rending scenes involving his estranged wife and daughter are proof of his promising dramatic talent, but the rest of the cardboard cut-out characters cannot be redeemed by a cast of fine actors, including Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies.
The problem with the film is not its implausible claim that an adult psychiatric ward is a great place for a teenager to learn life lessons. The problem is, for a film that belongs to a genre that prides itself in presenting relatable emotions and situations, there is actually very little to relate to here.

In 1810, a young South African woman named Saartjie was taken to Europe and displayed in a cage because of her un-European shape — specifically, her very large butt. She was referred to as the Venus Hottentot, and she was first shown off in a freak show, then by a doctor at a medical academy.
Locked in · Focusing on the nature of the unusual and the appeal of sex, Venus tells the story of Saartjie (Shirley Norman), a South African woman brought to Europe in a cage to be shown off as a physical oddity. - Neha Jain | Daily Trojan 
Suzan-Lori Parks’ Venus tells Saartjie’s story by assembling various literary, historical and medical sources along with her own theatrical tale, reimagining a previously untold history. And now it has come to USC, running through Sunday at the Bing Theatre.
Director Anita Dashiell-Sparks said she was interested in the “history of objectification, specifically of the colored female body, [and] how we participate in that.”
The play poses important questions about humanity and exploitation, and Dashiell-Sparks leads a strong ensemble in a moving and thought-provoking production of Parks’ unconventional play.
Both Dashiell-Sparks and actress Shirley Norman stress the importance of giving a voice to a woman who was silenced. Norman poignantly gives Saartjie a voice and humanity through her performance as the Venus Hottentot.
Norman described Saartjie as being, “In every way, a lover of life,” and the actress sweetly captures her innocent excitement and curiosity. Even though she is paraded as a freak, Norman always exhibits a natural poise, providing Saartjie with an inherent dignity lacked by those who objectify her. There is a quiet power in her performance that sets her apart from her castmates without losing a sense of ensemble.
Curtis Scott brings a lively energy to the role of the Negro Resurrectionist, who serves as narrator.
“[The character is] trying to bring order when there is chaos and violence surrounding [the Venus],” Scott said.
His commanding presence becomes an anchor for the audience in this nonlinear play. His introductions to each scene prevent the audience from ever getting too lost in the story without stopping to consider its source or  meaning. Whether reciting an autopsy report or interacting with Norman, Curtis brings charisma and compassion to the part.
The Mother Showman, played by Kate Williams, and the Baron Docteur, played by Joseph Orrach, are the two Europeans who essentially own Saartjie during the different phases of her life as the Venus Hottentot.
Both actors give complex performances that capture the contradiction of being both attracted to and repulsed by what they see as different from themselves. Despite her violent, abusive behavior toward Saartjie, the audience believes the Mother Showman when she says that Saartjie “always was my favorite child.”
During the Docteur’s medical speech on the Venus’s anatomy later in the play, Orrach’s quavering voice and stoic expression convey the Docteur’s inner conflict with objectifying the woman he supposedly loved.
The production’s greatest strength is its overall coherence in tone and purpose, along with the ensemble’s cohesion. There is a tangibly shared energy and vision among the actors that holds together Parks’ fractured narrative. While each of Mother Showman’s Eight Amazing Human Wonders has his own unique physicality, their movements work together to create a strong, unified presence onstage.
The actors perform amid a beautifully elaborate and functional set, designed by Vika Teplinskaya, that establishes the Venus’ world as a circus.
“There’s something we all can recognize in the circus. It welcomes you into the space,” Dashiell-Sparks said.
But this circus is dark and eerie, conveying that there is something wrong in this recognizable world. The colors of the circus are dulled, and gray paintings of leering spectators frame the stage. A reflective silhouette of the Venus is raised in the center of the stage, constantly reminding the audience of the shape of her body that made her so objectified, while forcing the viewer to see himself reflected in her.
Dashiell-Sparks stresses the importance of drawing parallels to the present. By playing songs such as Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” or Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On” during scene changes, she effectively confronts the audience with the modern problem of female exploitation in pop culture.
“A lot of people don’t realize where it came from,” Dashiell-Sparks said. “Saartjie’s story is where it came from.”
Norman agreed with her director’s thought.
“The sexuality that was placed on her body [has] trickled down to today, from plastic surgery to music videos,” she said.
After reading the play, Dashiell-Sparks says she was floored by the fact that Saartjie’s complete objectification was considered a valid form of entertainment.
“I was struck to my core,” she said. “How does this happen? How is it allowed to happen?”
Venus encourages the audience to truly examine and acknowledge those questions.
“This is part of your humanity,” Scott said.
It might not be an easy acknowledgement to make, but the powerful singular vision of cast and crew makes watching Venus not just an entertaining experience but an important one.

Students working at Leavey Library now have the option of renting computer locks for their laptops at the circulation desk, as part of a pilot project started by USC Libraries to counter theft.
Lock down · Michelle Yan, a graduate student who works at Leavey Library, brings out a rental computer lock from behind the counter. - Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan 
Students can rent locks and secure their laptops to stations on the second floor to prevent theft, said Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming at USC Libraries.
USC Libraries collaborated with the Undergraduate Student Government in an effort to complement the already extensive array of services offered at the library.
“The idea came out of speaking with the Undergraduate Student Government. It wasn’t in response to any particular increase in theft,” McHarg said.
The lock will reduce the risk of laptop theft if a student has to leave his laptop unattended while using the bathroom, taking a break or getting some water or coffee, he said.
Students will be able to rent the lock for four hours at a time, however, if students wish to use the locks for a longer period of time, they can go to the circulation desk and renew their rental.
So far, about 30 students have already rented locks, McHarg said.
Avery Berhle, a junior majoring in art history, said the locks would be good for students who study most of the time in Leavey Library.
“[The locks] are a great idea, especially during finals,” she said.
Sherif Higazy, a freshman majoring in cinema-television production, said he wondered why locks were necessary at the library.
“It’s troubling to know that this is enough of an issue to have to put this lock system in place. It seems convenient, but I’m just not accustomed to using a lock yet,” he said.
Some students, however, said they are more reluctant to make use of the laptop locks.
“I would still be worried even with the lock. It would stop people from stealing my laptop, but they would still be able to open my laptop and use it,” said Tehani De Fonseka, a senior majoring in psychology.
McHarg said that if the pilot proves successful, the lock system might be implemented throughout Leavey Library instead of just on the second floor.
In addition, student workers would inform people who come into the library with laptops that there are locks located at the circulation desk for their safety and convenience.
“We hope people will let us know how the system is working by leaving a comment on the Libraries website,” McHarg said. “We ultimately want to provide tools for a comfortable and safe study environment.”
Meghna Sapre, a graduate student studying computer science, said she also approves of the lock rental system.
“It would allow me to leave my things unattended if I had to run to the bathroom,” Sapre said.
These locks are not for rent.  Like all library materials, these locks are to lend, with a fee applied if the item is returned past the due time.  Also, these can be used throughout the library, not just the second level.
Thanks.

Nearly 800 engineers from across the country gathered at Bovard Auditorium on Thursday to engage in panel discussions and lectures that addressed 14 grand challenges in the field of engineering.
Students, professors and administrators from various engineering schools participated in the 2010 National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges National Summit, which addressed issues such as providing access to clean water and preventing nuclear terror. The summit was streamed live online, and attendees and viewers could send in questions via Twitter.
“Engineering is about invention; it’s not just learning a bunch of science,” said Matthew Tirrell, chair of UC Berkeley’s department of bioengineering. “It’s about transforming the world.”
A $1 million grant was announced at the summit Wednesday to fund the Maseeh Entrepreneurship Prize Competition, open exclusively to Viterbi School of Engineering students .
The first portion of the competition for a prize of $50,000 will take place in the spring, when teams will present a business plan before a panel of engineering professionals. The winner will have the opportunity to work with professional engineers to turn their ideas into reality.
“We need more of those [awards] to stimulate creativity, innovation and instill in students the fact that they’re not just here to graduate in four years and join the work force,” said Simin Pulat, professor of engineering at Oklahoma University. “There are all these challenges that are waiting for us to solve and they do matter.”
Keynote speaker Charles Vest, president of the National Academy of Engineering, said the summit was a place for engineers to come together and find inspiration.
“You need a society that truly understands what we do at engineers,” Vest said. “This is a platform, a framework to get people excited, and a format for national dialogue.”
An important part of the Massiah Foundation’s award is to get engineers thinking about the business applications of an invention, said Fariborz Maseeh, president of the Massiah Foundation.
“Engineers are necessary but not sufficient to deliver the goods,” Maseeh said. “It is the cardinal reason behind the prize being launched today.”
Vest said it is difficult discuss engineering in this country because of an obvious stigma against the field.
“Many young people are not choosing engineering as a career and that’s a problem,” Vest said. “There is a lack of understanding in society about what engineers do.”
Lisa Zerzemnieks, a senior majoring in civil engineering, agreed with the notion of an engineering stigma of being a nerd or deeply involved in research but said USC may be an exception to the rule.
“USC kind of fights the stigma. We have a lot of engineers that do more than engineering,” Zerzemnieks said. “Engineering can be my career, but it’s not my life.”
Vest went on to say that the greatest discrepancy among Asia, Europe and the United States in terms of industry is the lack of young engineers in the field.
“There’s still no good answer. We’re still struggling as to why engineering isn’t seen as exciting,” Pulat said. “It’s another challenge all by itself.”
Although the number of students in engineering might be scarce, funding sure isn’t.
“I don’t worry so much about the money. Someone once said, ‘We have no money now we have to think ,’” said Jeff Wilcox, corporate vice president for engineering of Lockheed Martin.
Wilcox said the funding could spawn innovation, a thought shared by Maseeh and the Massiah Foundation.
“When you create small pools of money, it is amazing what some people can do with knowledge,” Wilcox said. “What they’re producing is going to be seen.”

USC hospitals on the Health Sciences Campus went smoke-free on Oct. 1 in an effort to improve the well-being of patients, visitors and employees.
The two designated smoking areas that had been located adjacent to the USC University Hospital and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital were eliminated, and smoking was also banned from the open spaces immediately surrounding several other buildings on campus.
The idea of a smoke-free campus began in April, when a team of about 20 representatives of the HSC departments — including both hospitals, the Keck School of Medicine, the School of Pharmacy, and the departments of Physical and Occupational Therapy — met to discuss the initiative.
Led by Sharon Lee, administrator of clinical ancillary services for the USC hospitals, the team met for six months, gaining permission for and planning last week’s transition.
The team planned several measures for enforcing the new policy, including creating talking points for security and management personnel to use when approaching anyone they see smoking. The team began putting up notices about the ban in August.
“We try to approach it from the perspective of creating a safe and healthy environment,” Lee said. “For not only our patients and visitors, but also our employees.”
So far, the initiative hasn’t met any opposition from either the administration of any HSC departments or any smokers they’ve had to ask to stop smoking.
“We understood that for some people it would be a major change,” Lee said. “So we put signs and posters up, we put it on our website, our internal Internet — for every point of entry we could identify, we put some kind of communication out.”
Sarah Lerman, a first-year graduate student studying occupational therapy, attends classes at HSC and works there as a graduate assistant.
“It’s smart to be promoting healthy behavior at a hospital,” Lerman said. “And it makes it so people entering and exiting the hospital don’t have to walk through clouds of smoke.”
Lee and her team attribute part of their reasoning for the initiative to the increasing number of smoke-free campus policies hospitals nationwide are adopting.
According to a 2009 study by The Joint Commission and researchers from the Henry Ford Health System’s Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, 45 percent of hospitals had smoke-free campuses in February 2008. The study predicted that the vast majority of hospitals in the United States would go smoke-free by the end of 2009.

Feminism not a simple issue
I am writing a disappointed response to Allegra Tepper’s article, “Benefits to New Sexism Blur Lines of Equality,” published in the Daily Trojan on Sept. 28.
I find it impossible to consider this a thoughtful exploration of gender experience, as the author introduces her argument by showing utter disrespect toward feminism.
She says, “We all know the historical saga of sexual liberation,” suggesting first that everyone has knowledge of women’s history (which just isn’t true), referring to the generations of scholarship and civil activism that are feminism as a “saga,” and distilling the gains in equality to “sexual liberation,” complete with a mention of the “bra-burners,” which out of context only reinforces shallow perceptions of feminists.
The author says her article is not a “feminist rant,” revealing the kind of prejudice toward feminism that keeps the average person in the dark as to the true mission of the majority of feminists:  equality.
Tepper calls a recent Zeta Beta Tau’s party a “microcosm of Millennials content with the double standard,” claiming that women who accepted discounted entry at one party at one college in one city in one country speak for women everywhere.
The author also ventures, “I think we can all agree that for the most part the population of women picketing for equal opportunities … has significantly diminished.”
It’s dangerous to assume that all her readers agree on this contentious subject.
Women assume agency all over the world; every day, more and more organizations, businesses and governments are hearing the call of hard-working, outspoken women. Women don’t just picket. They write, speak, create art, unionize, run for office and do thousands of other things to seek and demand equality.
Let’s not overlook the fact that the “special treatment” women receive upon entrance to clubs and parties is entirely for the benefit of the men who host these parties, the ones who want a heavy female to male ratio to better their chances of a hookup. A woman accepting this offer does not hold more power than a man but rather plays into the male-dominant power structure at play.
The author closes her article by asking, “Who is advocating for the men?” Certainly feminist scholars study not just the needs and struggles of women, but rather the gender roles defined for both sexes. That said, although women have made significant and hard-earned gains (especially in the Western, middle-class world), women still make 75 cents to the dollar that men make. Women own 1 percent of the world’s property and control less than a third of the world’s wealth.
Yes, it is important to look at sexism as it operates both ways. But it is first important to be well-versed in the history of women’s struggles and of gender in society.
Although young college women might receive a free drink at a party, women across the globe (and on our own campus) experience daily inequality, the realities of which Tepper’s article neglects to engage with entirely.
I found this article to be only a shallow rendering of gender study, an affront to feminism and feminists, and a reinforcement of uninformed opinions on gender inequality.
What are we to learn from such a surface look at such a complex issue?

Excellent response, Haley!
Allegra Tepper certainly has a lot to learn and needs to get some real world experience.
Bravo! :) Great piece and great response to the previous article. Thanks for speaking up!

Here’s a piece of advice I’m sure you’ve heard before: “Remember — first impressions are everything.” It’s a bite-sized recommendation, omnipresent in career pamphlets, self-help books and chirpy dating columns.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Many of us have accepted it as common sense. It has a nice ring to it. Yet the underlying message is sinister: If at first you don’t succeed, don’t try, try again — you blew it. It’s a call to give up that masquerades as a helpful tip, and it encourages a mindset that prevents people from taking ownership of their gaffes and recovering gracefully.
Thus, the idea that first impressions are everything is little more than a self-fulfilling prophecy. Accept it at your own risk.
This advice is most commonly given before job interviews. Reasonable as it seems in such a formal environment, imagine hearing it right before you step into the interviewer’s office. You’re smart, you’re qualified, you ate a balanced breakfast and you really felt like you could nail this talk.
But you’re now painfully reminded that any mistake you make could bring down the whole house of cards. Instead of feeling empowered, you’ve framed yourself as helpless.
First impressions aren’t a death sentence. Even if you trip into the office or say something embarrassing right off the bat, being able to recover shows maturity and quick thinking — qualities that appeal to any employer. If you mispronounce your interviewer’s name, she’ll like you far more if you apologize and carry on with poise than if you spend the rest of the interview contemplating your shoes.
For instance, take my job. I’m an SCaller; in short, I call USC alumni I’ve never met and ask them to donate to the school. The potential for awkward situations is astronomical.
First of all, people tend to loathe solicitors from the get-go. Second, I butcher names and introductions like nobody’s business. But I can’t count the number of times that I’ve gotten initial eye-rollers to donate.
As mortifying as it is to carry on with the knowledge that I’ve been judged, I put myself in a position of control. I breathe, remind myself that I’m working for a good cause and proceed to tell the alumni about all the wonderful programs we have at USC. A focus on first impressions would literally prevent me from doing my job.
I won’t pretend that my experiences apply to everyone. Luckily, popular culture is on my side.
Consider a few famous stories: Pride and Prejudice, in which the protagonist marries a man she detests for most of the book; the Harry Potter series, in which Harry and Ron think Hermione is a nuisance before she completes their trio; The Breakfast Club, in which the teens see each other’s worst behavior and become friends anyway. To list every popular story with a similar plot, I’d have to camp out in Leavey Library for days.
These stories have touched and enthralled millions of people. To enjoy a story, people must relate to it; thus, it’s reasonable to assume that on some level, we’re all aware of the fact that first impressions are often wrong — and that they’re worth overcoming.
Of course, the characters I listed went through extreme circumstances before they changed their minds, but it is worth noting that the impressions themselves were extreme, too. The real world is far less dramatic. Most first impressions are fairly mild. We don’t need trolls and Saturday detention to turn them around.
First impressions are not black-and-white. They play a part in people’s decisions, but it’s rather extreme to say that they create irreparable dents.
The off-color comment you made to your interviewer is no roadblock — it’s a challenge to step up your game. With calmness, tact and a little cleverness, it can become nothing but a bump in the road.

Warner Bros.’ reboot of the Superman franchise has found its director, and it’s Zack Snyder. Snyder, best known for his adaptations of Frank Miller’s 300 and Alan Moore’s Watchmen, will direct a script written by David Goyer from a story by the film’s producer — and Batman director — Christopher Nolan.
General Zod, previously played with aplomb by Terrance Stamp in Superman II, will be the bad guy, and it is unlikely that Superman Returns star Brandon Routh will return as the Man of Steel.
On one hand, it is easy to see why Warner Bros. choose Snyder. 300 made a lot of money at the box office, and Watchmen, although not as successful, was a very true adaptation with little deviation from the source material. However, he does not really seem right for the job. Superman is not some hulking character good only for action scenes — Superman works best when stories deal with his emotional struggles, not his physical ones. That is part of why Superman Returns was so effective, especially Brandon Routh’s performance.
Snyder’s washed out, ultra-stylized visual style seems at odds with Nolan’s penchant for realism and non-CGI effects. It will be interesting to see how Snyder’s action and flair style of directing mixes with Nolan’s cerebral and plot-heavy sense of storytelling.
I am looking forward to this film. I believe Snyder has a very good visual style akin to making Superman’s fights interesting for once. Granted, while writing and character is not his strong suit (Well, we shall see with Sucker Punch), I think that with his great visual strength matched with Goyers writing and Nolans skill-set for developing new characters and plots, it should be a grand compilation of talent, turning superman from a dull protagonist to an actually exciting and quality film.

Los Angeles is notorious for its miles of automobile-congested roads, but this Sunday a seven-mile section of streets running from East Hollywood through downtown to Boyle Heights will be closed to car traffic as part of a city-sponsored event known as CicLAvia.
The event — which takes its name from the Spanish word for bike path, ciclovia — will close certain streets from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., giving free reign to people to use the open space as they wish.
Organizers say people are planning to use the streets for a variety of activities, including bicycle rides, soccer matches, yoga classes, dance routines, and political protests. A Brazilian capoeira group is even planning to take their talents to the streets.

Congress passed legislation this week that would make it more difficult to fight bank foreclosures, but President Barack Obama said he will not sign the bill.
Consumer groups warn that the bill — titled the Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act — would make it harder for people to challenge foreclosures because it acknowledges out-of-state documents.
According to ABC News, the president decided that the bill would harm too many homeowners during a tough economic time.
“It is something that, as you said, there has been a lot of news on, the processing of documentation, the resulting impact on foreclosures, and that is being evaluated….In general, there is concern, ultimately, about the situation,” said White House Spokesperson Robert Gibbs.
He declined to say more about the bill.

USC’s 17th annual Good Neighbors Campaign kicked off Oct. 1 with a new monetary goal — $1.3 million.
With the primary goal of giving back to the Los Angeles community and creating an educationally enriched environment for adults and children, the monthlong campaign — which receives donations from staff and faculty — serves to provide grant funding to programs located within the community surrounding the university.
“With the USC tradition of civic engagement, part of our mission is solving societal needs: [We need] an academic institution to provide academic opportunities,” Campaign Director Carolina Castillo said. “Giving is about settling problems, the civic engagement of faculty and staff and enhancing the communities and lives of residents of Los Angeles. We have a long tradition of that at this school, and the tradition of giving is much the same.”
Last year, the Good Neighbors Campaign set out to raise $1.2 million from staff and faculty. The new goal of $1.3 million was set based on the amount of money received in 2009, Castillo said, and the trends of increasing participation and involvement that campaign leaders saw over time.
This year, the campaign has seen almost 140 faculty and staff members volunteer as campaign leaders to raise awareness and money for the project. Castillo said she believes that such increased participation will bring in more funds; she hopes to reach at least 15,000 university employees.
“Contributions are critical, and the goal is increasing because needs are increasing,” Castillo said. “I think that the goal is achievable, and USC faculty and staff understand the impact that their contributions are making in the community and that the need continues to grow every year. Given that they know that this is the impact they are having, we can meet that goal.”
In previous years, money generated from the campaign was distributed among many organizations, each of which sponsored programs to benefit the community around them. Last year, grants were given to 43 organizations out of 60 that applied. This year, coordinators hope to increase that number, Castillo said.
Last year, funding went to organizations such as the Thornton School of Music and the Fisher Museum of Art to create programs for kids in the community.
“These kids can say things through art that they can’t say through words,” said Selma Holo, the director of the gallery and a member working in conjunction with the Good Neighbors Campaign-sponsored Art in the Village Program, to which $25,991 was given.
The program was designed to allow children to come to the Fisher Museum and take interest in interactive art workshops.
“We see students here in a way that we’ve never seen before, and we have kids that are really members of Fisher, and the kids feel like they belong. It’s a sustainable relationship, and we know they’ll come back in the future even when these programs are over,” Holo said.
Similar funds were provided to the Thornton School of Music, which used $33,880 on the USC Thornton Student Outreach Program, which provided music education to students from grades K-12.
“It’s a strong partnership between the community and Thornton,” said Thornton faculty member Susan Helfter. “These programs are beneficial to both our students and the students outside the USC gates, and the interaction gives music a different dimension. It’s clear that these programs are really making a difference to these kids.”
