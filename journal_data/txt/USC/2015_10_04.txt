Follow these five shopping tips to ensure you only buy what you need and will actually wear. Samantha Kim | Daily Trojan
For many college students, you may notice money gets tight every now and then. In-between paying for school supplies, food and fun, there might not be enough money left for your wardrobe. Trying to stay up-to-date with constantly changing trends has the ability to empty your wallet. Here are a few tips to helping prevent you from breaking the bank during your next shopping spree:
Rule 1: Buy what you love, not just what you think you need
I am all for splurging every now and then for a pair of shoes or new top, but knowing when to spend and when to save is important. If I am absolutely positive I will use or wear an item to its fullest capacity, only then will I make the purchase. I mostly spend my money on my more basic, everyday items like jeans, solid tanks and sneakers because I now they are easy to match an outfit with, and I’ll wear them all the time.
Remember: avoid impulse buys by thinking ahead. Consider how many times you will really wear whatever you are trying to buy, and think about how it looks with other pieces in your wardrobe.
Rule 2: Try on everything before purchase
Though I am guilty of forgetting this rule, it’s important to try everything on before purchase. Do not simply assume that it will fit or look good on you just because it did great things for the model. Even for smaller buys like t-shirts or leggings, I high suggest trying them on first. This is the best way to determine comfort and fit. Save yourself the possibility of the having to make a trip to return and just try it on.
Rule 3: Avoid online shopping
Many might disagree, but I would say stop the online shopping all together. As fun and easy as shopping online seems, it can be a huge waste of money. Prices add up quickly when you keep adding more to your online basket, and you never get to try the item on before purchasing it. Photos can be extremely misleading, and it is most likely going to look different on you than on the models, who have the advantage of Photoshop and personal trainers.
Rule 4: Don’t go crazy for sales
Sales are fantastic, especially for those who are on a tight budget. However, be careful what you do chose to buy from promotional sales. Make sure you truly love the item and aren’t just buying it because it comes at a great price. Know for sure that you will put it to good use.
Rule 5: Skip high-maintenance items
I would say forget anything that requires too much effort, or too much money to maintain. Splurging here and there is fine by me, but if the pricey item is going to cost me even more at the dry cleaners every time its in of a need a wash, then forget it. A student budget is tight enough and paying more for an item, even after making the hefty buy, doesn’t seem practical.

Snapchat is one way to stay up to date with the news while living a busy college life.
Let’s face it, when you’re in school, it’s easy to get stuck in your own little bubble. Between classes, midterms, clubs and social activities, there is barely any time to sleep, let alone keep up with the news. However, being a busy college student isn’t an excuse for not being informed. It’s important to be aware of what’s going on in the rest of the world not only to engage with other people, but also to be able to make smart, responsible decisions for yourself.
Below are five tips on how to squeeze time in your day to learn some current events:
1. Download a news app that can give you daily updates
I’ve actually never opened my CNN app to search for news because the app conveniently gives me notifications every day. Whenever an interesting story pops up that catches my eye, I can just click on it, and the app will take me directly to the article. The interface is also quite user-friendly, so I have no problem reading straight from my phone. My other suggestions for news apps are Tweetbot and Twitterific, BBC, Yahoo News Digest.
2. Listen to NPR while driving
I know it’s tempting to jam out to top 40 songs, but you don’t always have to listen to music when the radio is on. Even if you’re just going on a short drive to the grocery store, tune into some news or even podcasts to get your daily scoop. My personal favorite is NPR’s TED Radio Hour, which I listen to on my way to work for some extra inspiration in the morning.
3. Subscribe to a magazine or newspaper
Because I’m a business major, my dad has subscribed me to Entrepreneur, Forbes and the Wall Street Journal since my freshman year. Now that I’m finally reading all three of these on a consistent basis, I can admit that I’ve become 10 times more business-savvy and business-minded. Even flipping through some of these articles will help you when you’re in an interview because you can cite information about new trends and breakthroughs in different industries. Win-win!
4. Watch the stories on Snapchat’s Discover feature
If you’re a visual person, you can find interesting news videos just by tapping through stories on Snapchat. Besides CNN, Snapchat also features content from Cosmopolitan and ESPN, which users can click through to keep up with the latest events in celebrity gossip and the sports arena.
5. Read the Daily Trojan, of course!
Last but not least, our student-run newspaper is a great source of information for what’s going on in the community. The Daily Trojan features articles about a range of topics, from construction for the new USC Village, to student debates about this year’s presidential election. Whatever you’re interested in, you can flip through our paper for all things related to USC, as well as the greater Los Angeles area and beyond.

College comes at a hefty price. Annual tuition aside, students are required to pay additional fees for things like school supplies, textbooks, housing and meal plans.

So, if you’re dreaming of a wardrobe makeover but can’t spare the extra cash, here are six stores to keep on your radar:

The Annual Security and Fire Safety report, which was released by the Department of Public Safety last Wednesday, illustrates a continuous decrease in crime in the USC community according to Deputy Chief David Carlisle.
Reports of auto theft dropped from 21 in 2013 to six in 2014, and reports of robbery decreased from 17 to 11. Both of these crimes have been steadily decreasing since 2012. However, reports of burglary increased from 28 to 31 in the last year and aggravated assault increased from eight to 10. Carlisle noted that when reports of crimes are relatively low, increases and decreases can be coincidental and difficult to prevent.
Another decrease occurred in Violence Against Women Act crimes. These crimes are defined by a 1994 federal law and include domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking. The University created new policies to address these crimes in 2013 and saw a decrease from 26 to 17 reports in the last year.
“The University has implemented policies to make sexual assault reporting easier for students; therefore, DPS anticipated an increase in the number of reports,” Carlisle said. “However, the opposite was true. We hope that increased awareness and prevention have led to the decrease.”
A significant spike occurred on the Health Sciences campus, where motor vehicle theft rose from two reports in 2013 to 13 reports in 2014. Carlisle attributed this to the expansion of the campus, which has caused an increase in parking premiums. This typically causes students and faculty to park on side streets, which are not as closely monitored as the parking structures. DPS is currently building a new parking structure that will provide more secure parking spots.
Despite the spike, Carlisle reports that the number of auto thefts on the Health Sciences Campus are still remarkably lower than the average number in surrounding neighborhoods. To keep those numbers low, he is coordinating with LAPD to increase security presence in the areas where theft most often occurred. This effort is just part of the overall coordinating effort between DPS and the LAPD, who feel that the USC campus is continuing to lead the nation in safety and security measures.
“We believe that the crime statistics demonstrate that USC compares very favorably in comparison to institutions of higher learning in similar urban environments,” Carlisle said. “While in reality the objective of continual declines may be unachievable, our goal is to make USC the safest urban campus in America.”
The report is mandated by the Jeanne Clery Act, a 1990 federal statute aimed at providing accurate reports of on-campus safety. All colleges that receive federal funding are required to produce a security report that provides detailed analysis of certain types of crime on campus and in the surrounding area by Oct. 1 each year. The report also gives a detailed description of the University’s relationship with local police and its campus-wide procedures and policies for emergencies, discipline and security.
“The Annual Security Report’s purpose is to provide current and prospective students and staff with crime statistics so that they can make informed decisions about which educational institutions to attend or as a place of employment,” Carlisle said. “We are pleased to able to report an overall decrease in reportable crime over the prior year with notable reductions in robbery, auto theft and Violence Against Women Act crimes.”

In an effort to motivate students to take action against climate change, Know Tomorrow, a student-led movement spanning 60 college campuses nationwide, held an activity fair and a series of speakers featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in McCarthy Quad on Friday.
In partnership with the Undergraduate Student Government Program Board, the Environmental Student Assembly, the Speakers Committee and the Academic Culture Assembly, Know Tomorrow’s event aimed to educate students about community-wide environmental initiatives.
Students spent the day learning about the environment from different groups on campus, and participated in activities intended to teach participants about sustainability in an engaging manner.
Among these activities were a “Change the Course Challenge,” which showed students the importance of facilitating the Earth’s recovery; a solar-powered popcorn machine sponsored by the California Public Interest Research Group and Environmental Core; Elementerra, a virtual reality video game; and a SolarCity Exhibit featuring solar power ovens, microwaves and air conditioning units.
Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
“[This event] has changed my perspective because it showed me that there are a lot of new, cool inventions and ways to make people aware of this [issue],” said Carrisa Chang, a freshman majoring in business administration.
The event also featured professor of earth sciences Will Berelson, youth director of Earth Guardians Xiuhtezcahtl Martinez, founder of Tree People Andy Lipkis, NASA climate scientist Veronica Nieves, YouTuber Derek Muller and environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“I really appreciated the number of viewpoints we had and the way [the speakers] interacted,” said Environmental Core member Zach Manta. “One of my favorite parts was watching the interactions.”
Manta was among a group of students initially contacted last spring by Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences and Vice Dean Steven Lamy about the Know Tomorrow movement. The national event was launched by Wendy Abrams, founder of Cool Globes, who donated money to USC to help fund a climate science campaign.
“We originally tried to make this an event that was just a simple shout through many voices, saying ‘Hey, let’s do something about [the state of the environment],’” Manta said. “But it turned into a critical discussion [involving] a lot of people who are already really concerned about the problem.”
Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
This event was directed at continuing this discussion on sustainability throughout the University.
“I think the fact that USC is trying to change something is really great, but at the same time, I recognize the fact that there is much to be changed,” said Abhishek Sharma, a freshman majoring in biological sciences. “For example, [there are] very small amounts of renewable energy used here on campus, and there’s also lots of issues with [a lack of] recycling bins.”
Program Board marketing director Chelsea Zhang, who helped coordinate the event, said she hopes students will be more inspired to take action.
“I hope students can see how many other people are here to support [this event],” Zhang said. “Our events are fun, and there [are] a lot of cool organizations out here that are supporting this cause. It shouldn’t be a burden to be more eco-friendly.”
Manta added that although he has studied the environment extensively through his major and Environmental Core, he was still able to broaden his knowledge on the subject.
“I didn’t expect myself to be so opened up to the world of possibilities and the complexity of the problem and what we can do about it,” Manta said.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks on campus to reflect on the role of natural resources in work, health and identity as Americans. He reminded students of their responsibility to preserve the planet for future generations as a part of the speaker series of Know Tomorrow. Tal Volk | Daily Trojan

On Saturday and Sunday, USC hosted the SoCal Innovation Forum’s fourth annual conference, which highlighted the rapid growth of entrepreneurship in Los Angeles and emphasized the city’s position as the third-best startup city in the world.
The event presented an opportunity for attendees to hear from a variety of speakers, including founders, CEOs, venture capitalists and directors of major companies such as Mattel, Deloitte and 20th Century Fox. Attendees could also present their startup ideas to potential investors from the United States and China.
To host the event, L.A.-based nonprofit PlusYoou partnered with Blackstone LaunchPad USC, WeStart Club, Zuma Ventures and the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. More than 500 students, alumni and professionals attended the event, some coming from as far away as China.
“The business cooperation between the U.S. and China has enormous potential,” said Hua Liu, an opening speaker for the event. “The Chinese dream is about peace, development and cooperation, and is connected to the American Dream.”
This marks the first year that SIF has taken place on campus, in a move that Blackstone LaunchPad USC Project Director James Bottom said will facilitate student involvement in entrepreneurship.
“USC has the second-largest international student population of any university in the United States, and it speaks to the diversity that we have here to talk about what is happening in Los Angeles and Asia, and to bring these speakers together for an overall program,” Bottom said.
Event organizers such as Jennifer Zhang, cofounder of PlusYoou, hope that the event can help to increase collaboration between industries in Southern California and China, according to the organization’s press release.
“More China-based venture capital is getting into Southern California as Chinese investors are expanding their businesses here,” Zhang said in the release. “However, their information of local investment or development opportunities is limited. We are here to facilitate investments and make things easier for both sides of the table.”
According to its website, PlusYoou promotes the growth of startups through business consulting, tech support, human resources, financing and public relations services. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumna Peggie Li, master of entertainment management ’10, who works as an adviser for PlusYoou, said that the company’s vision for startup growth ties in to the University’s goals of fostering student innovation.
“I jumped from traditional media to new media because of the education that I got at USC,” Li said. “It shaped my career from the beginning.”
This spirit of technological innovation drives USC initiatives such as Blackstone, which, according to Bottom, provides students with an entrepreneurial environment that supports the growth of companies from the entertainment industry to the nonprofit sector. Blackstone currently plans to host more than 250 events this school year and supports more than 350 startups at USC.
“If you’re a student looking to go join a startup, there are a lot of online resources that you can use and a number of different student clubs that are designed to get students integrated into the ecosystem,” Bottom said.
The prevalence of organizations such as Blackstone, combined with the growth of the Los Angeles startup culture, makes SIF organizers such as Li hopeful that the event will inspire many to pursue their entrepreneurial goals. Li’s advice for students hoping to start their own businesses hinges around taking advantage of these opportunities.
“Make mistakes as much as you can when you are young,” Li said. “Get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself — be responsible for your future.”

Two undefeated teams went into the Galen Center Sunday afternoon, and the No. 2 Women of Troy (16-0, 4-0 Pac-12) came out on top with a 3-1 victory over No. 5 Washington (13-1, 3-1 Pac-12).
USC came out on fire early and won the first set 25-16. The Huskies battled back and took the second set 25-22. The Women of Troy then found their momentum and came back 25-21 in the third set.
The fourth set was by far the most intense and competitive set of the night, and arguably USC’s season. With a total of 27 tie scores and 15 lead changes, the Women of Troy pulled out a 33-31 victory.
Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio led the team with 27 kills, three aces and 16 digs. Head coach Mick Haley gave Bricio credit for maintaining her composure throughout the match and keeping the team motivated, especially in the final set.
Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“When you’ve got one go-to that just doesn’t let you down,” Haley said. “That gives you hope.”
Bricio was set a total of 72 times in the match, and with over 30 serves, that puts her over 100 swings in the match. Haley likened that to baseball pitchers and how they won’t last if they’re always pitching 80, 90, 100 pitches per game.
The Huskies also targeted Bricio with their serves. Bricio felt the pressure from their serves, but she didn’t let it affect her at all. Haley noted that with all the weightlifting and training she’s been doing, if the Huskies knew that they probably wouldn’t have targeted her as much.
Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“I heard some football players say ‘holy cow, do you see what she’s lifting, and she’s in season!’” Haley said.
Haley noted that the team remained in the match because they just don’t quit. He pointed out that there wasn’t just one person who was going to win the match for them, they had to do it together.
Senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms was second on the team with 12 kills. She dominated defensively at the net with a total of six blocks. Haley emphasized how her overall presence at the net tonight was giving Washington fits and that they even tried to set away from her because she shut down senior middle blocker Melanie Wade.
“Ogoms was putting her hands over the net like nobody’s business,” Haley said. “She is a big-time blocker.”
Haley had high praise for the freshmen: setter Baylee Johnson, outside hitter Alyse Ford and walk-on defensive specialist Victoria Garrick. He credits their resilience to the team’s continued success.
Another key to the team’s success is their overall mentality. Both Bricio and Ogoms emphasized that the team not only looks at each set one at a time, but also each point at a time.
Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
That focus has given them the ability to have fun while still playing to the best of their ability. Haley credits the team’s overall personality and mentality to their continuing success.
“You’ve got to have fun,” Haley said.
In that final set, Bricio and Ogoms mentioned that the team was joking about how the game felt like their “favorite drill” they always do.
“We were just trying to stay relaxed,” Ogoms said. “We do this every day in practice.”
Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
This hard-fought match proved that the Women of Troy have the ability to compete, especially against one of their top opponents in the Pac-12.
On Friday night, the Women of Troy defeated Washington State in three sets. Though it may seem like it was an easy match, Haley mentioned that the team worked hard and battled for the victory.
Through both matches, Haley was impressed with the improvement that the team showed, especially on defense. He was happy with how his team stayed in sets by utilizing their defensive strengths.
Next weekend, the Women of Troy hit the road to face No. 6 Arizona State (15-0, 4-0 Pac-12), the only other undefeated team in the conference, and No. 14 Arizona (12-4, 2-2 Pac-12). Haley emphasized the team’s resilience and competitive nature.
“Every night you just have to take one at a time,” Haley said.

A month into the college football season, and as always, it is predictably unpredictable. Since USC had a bye this week, it offered the perfect opportunity to check in on the rest of the college football landscape.
In what was an exciting and eventful day, Saturday’s games made it pretty clear that the race to the college football playoff is a wide open affair.
Though USC certainly has a long way to go, it’s comforting to know that if they can somehow play up to their immense potential they have not been eliminated from contention, not by a longshot.
The Pac-12 was in flux on Saturday with another top-10 team getting knocked off, this time the UCLA Bruins by the Sun Devils. This is the same Arizona State team that the Trojans dismantled last week in Tempe. While it would be easy to use the associative law to conclude USC is superior to UCLA, the Arizona State team that came out this weekend was wildly different than the one the Trojans faced.
This underscores the unpredictability of college football and especially the Pac-12. With so many talented teams, it’s hard to even take a quarter off. Keeping a group of college athletes motivated for an entire season with zero lapses is almost impossible, and that’s why it will be pretty difficult for any team in the Pac-12 to make it through undefeated or even with one loss.
It’s only the beginning of October and the only two undefeated teams in the Pac-12 are Cal and Utah. No one could have seen that coming just a few weeks ago.
The balance and top to bottom strength of the Pac-12 should be a respectable fact among the punditry of college football, but the bias toward the SEC is still apparent.
A few weeks ago a highly ranked USC team lost to Stanford and everyone was calling the Pac-12 weak and undeserving of the hype. Though I would agree that USC as a team was a bit overrated, that same analysis seemingly did not apply to Ole Miss on Saturday. After the rebels were trounced by then 25th-ranked Florida, commentator after commentator said this spoke to the immense depth of the SEC.
I can’t reconcile how USC’s close loss to Stanford makes the Pac-12 weak, but when No. 3 Ole Miss gets routed by Florida, the SEC is strong. This bias will seemingly last forever, no matter how many top 25 teams the  Pac- 12 has.
The only real issue will arise come playoff time, if a one-or-two loss SEC team gets in over a team from the Pac-12 with a similar body of work.
Hopefully that issue does not hurt USC, but it very well could victimize a Pac-12 team as the squads beat each other up week in and week out.
In terms of the SEC though, Alabama is still king. After coming into each game favored for 73 straight matchups, the Crimson Tide were an underdog against Georgia.
Nick Saban showed the country that Alabama should never be an underdog as they absolutely manhandled the Bulldogs, winning 38-10.
With the exception of the Crimson Tide and the one man LSU wrecking ball, otherwise known as Leonard Fournette, the SEC is not that much more impressive than the Pac-12, nor is any other conference.
Both the Big 12 and the Big 10 have some talented teams, but it appears that USC will have to face one of the toughest schedules of any top team nationally throughout the duration of the season.
The Trojans admittedly have a lot to figure out at this point in the season, but if they can, there is no reason to think that they are out of contention.
Hopefully this bye week reminded the team that the college football season is a wild ride, and no one knows what will happen next.
If the Trojans can get past what seems like a trap game against the Huskies, they will enter the meat of their schedule ready to make a statement to the world. Or they won’t, and it will be clear that all of the preseason hype was unwarranted.
Either way, it should be an interesting ride as they face off against three straight ranked opponents after the Huskies.
Outside of Troy, the season will continue to have twists and turns galore, which makes every Saturday in the fall extremely enjoyable.

It was a triumphant weekend for the No.3-ranked USC men’s water polo team at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, as they defeated No. 2 Stanford 12-8 in overtime on Saturday and blew out San Jose State 17-3 on Sunday to advance to 3-0 in MPSF action.
Behind an 18-save effort from goalkeeper McQuin Baron, the Trojans atoned for their lone loss of the season — a 6-5 defeat at the hands of the Cardinal on Sept. 20 in the Kap7 NorCal Invitational.
“It was a confidence builder,” Baron said. “We knew we could beat the best teams but actually beating a top three team … it helps with momentum going into next week’s SoCal tournament.”
Maya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
In a wild finish, Stanford rallied from an 8-3 deficit in the second half to force overtime. But USC  had all the momentum in the overtime sessions, scoring four unanswered goals for a signature win over the team just ahead of them in the rankings.
“[It’s] very emotional and exciting for us,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “We had an excellent two and a half quarters and then defensively, we had a letdown at the end of the game. They came back and the entire momentum was in their favor. We were able to put it all together and have an excellent overtime and score four goals.”
“We had to avenge the loss at NorCal,” sophomore two-meter Lachlan Edwards said. “We couldn’t score goals in that game.”
Nick Bell delivered the game-winning tally on the power play with 1:33 left in the first overtime, scoring in front off a pass from Matteo Morelli that put the Trojans up 9-8.
The Trojans played stifling defense in overtime, keeping Stanford off the scoreboard. Following the go-ahead goal, Morelli recorded a steal that led to a goal by Mihajlo Milicevic.
The Cardinal had a chance to respond on the power play, but were shut down by Baron, who made several pivotal stops in overtime. On the ensuing USC possession, Edwards fired a bullet of a shot into the net with the shot clock running down, giving USC an 11-8 lead. Nick Bell applied the finishing touches with a breakaway goal.
“The first thing was getting our offense going today,” Baron said. “Our offense was on it today. We set everyone up and did everything we needed to do offensively.”
The two teams went back and forth to start the game, with the match tied at 3-3 early in the second period. But USC scored five unanswered goals, starting with Edwards’ second tally of the game at the 5:43 mark of the period.
Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
USC held Stanford scoreless for a nine-minute stretch in the second and third periods, blocking shots and creating turnovers. But Bryce Hoerman’s goal from the point with 2:52 to play in the third period would be USC’s last of regulation, as Stanford methodically battled back. Two late goals by Adam Abdulhamid and Bret Bonanni for the Cardinal evened the score and forced overtime.
“We stuck to our gameplay and kept our composure,” Baron said of the momentum swings. “This is what we trained for, what we spent all those hours in the pool for. You have to be overly prepared so you don’t have to be nervous.”
The Trojans followed up Saturday’s emotional victory with a blowout of San Jose State, a 14-goal victory that saw three players — Blake Edwards, Lazar Pasuljevic and Grant Stein — record hat tricks.
“Those goals came from work from the entire team,” Pasuljevic said. “As a result of hard swimming and good defense, if you have good defensive pressure, you can go onto the attack.”
The Trojans led 10-1 after two periods and were 5-of-7 on the power play. They also forced 20 turnovers from the Spartans and poured on 35 shots on goal.
Next up for USC is the SoCal Invitational, where they will likely face off against Stanford once again in the semifinals.
“We’re ready for that,” Vavic said. “That’s going to be another big game.”

In the latest effort to counter police brutality, Gov. Jerry Brown approved legislation enforcing California police officers to collect demographic data from each person they stop. In each case, the officer must include the race of the person stopped, the reason for the stop and the result of the stop, no matter if it is a citation or arrest. According to the Wall Street Journal, this new action could lead the state to alter its definition of racial profiling. The law follows other measures combating racial profiling throughout the nation, including the inclusion of police body cameras, mandatory diversity training and analysis of each case involving force. Though the congressional tactic is a positive development in the crusade against racial oppression, it is not nearly enough to completely eliminate racist behavior in police officers.
Undoubtedly, racial bias is a huge component in unjust incarceration, and data already collected by the attorney general’s office has provided insight to that. In California, black people make up 6 percent of the population, and yet 17 percent of the people in jail are black, 25 percent of whom die in custody. The statistics also show that young black men are 25 percent more likely to be jailed than white men.
But numbers only provide one piece of the puzzle. The publication of these statistics allows for the public to be clued in to the inherent injustice in the system itself, but it leaves out the corruption found in some task forces. According to Think Progress, police officers infringing upon citizens’ rights are almost never prosecuted for their crimes. In 2013, no charges were pressed against an officer who shot an unarmed black man in Chicago. Additionally, two former police officers were acquitted even though they senselessly beat a schizophrenic homeless man to death. The lack of justice goes without saying in the cases of Eric Garner or Michael Brown’s deaths. In most of these cases, police officers are asked back to the force, sometimes even without suspension.
A conglomeration of tactics should be instated. The mandate of body cameras has been met with controversy, but oftentimes, it paints a clearer picture about any misconduct. Training on diversity and mental health issues is also essential because it increases sensitivity.
Moreover, what’s most important is for the transparency to come from law enforcement. Since most police brutality cases go under the radar and result in the officer leaving unscathed, the public has the right to know when that happens. This would incite much-needed conversation between the police and the community about representation for the victims and a fair outcome. Certain groups, such as 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement, have worked to improve communication between the community and police officers.
Ultimately, the remedy to racial profiling requires a balancing act. Though they can provide information on the next steps in tackling racial injustice, simple numbers can only do so much to help with the overall issue. It takes the equilibrium between the police and community to firmly establish that police brutality must be addressed.

It has been a little under two months since the anniversary of the death of Michael Brown, and finally — finally — new legislation paints real progress for police reform in California. Last week, Gov. Jerry Brown passed Bill AB 953 to require agencies to collect demographic data on those stopped by police, update the definition of racial and identity profiling to be more comprehensive, formulate an advisory board to eradicate racial profiling and increase diversity among police.
More than just a step in the right direction, the bill is indicative of a greater recognition that body cameras alone won’t fix the issue of a law enforcement that dehumanizes its citizens in a state that boasts the highest number of people killed by the police. It is comprehensive, and hopes to set a precedent for other states to take concrete steps toward limiting the influence of racial profiling.
The bill’s primary strength is that it fully addresses the state’s lack of racial profiling data, which has greatly hindered its ability to make more specific police reform. It is high time that we are able to understand the demographics of those stopped and searched so that police misconduct can be identified and more specifically traced on an individual and institutional level. Advisory boards allow more specific analysis about police misconduct per department — which sidesteps the overgeneralization lawmakers often make about police brutality, which assumes all departments interact with their citizens in exactly the same fashion.
Moreover, the bill’s demand for increased diversity among law enforcement addresses the mounting representation problem within California’s police departments that enables police brutality. While in other parts of the country disparate racial differences can be seen in white and black populations — Ferguson’s police force was 55 percent more white than its residents according to The New York Times — Los Angeles’s story is mostly between white and brown populations. In Montclair, for example, the police department is 69 percent more white than its mainly Hispanic residents — so the racial disparity is actually higher than it is in Ferguson. And though the gap is between white and Hispanic people, the power dynamic, and the racial profiling that follows, remains similar.
But perhaps the most surprising part about AB 953 is its comprehensiveness. In updating the definition of identity profiling to include gender and sexual orientation, the bill encourages intersectional change that highlights injustices not only to people of color, but to women and those who do not identify as heterosexual. This addition suggests that the bill is not, in fact, a temporary solution in response to nationwide publicity of the mistreatment of black and brown people, but rather a legitimate effort to more correctly enact justice toward marginalized populations.
Since the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement, I have been filled with outrage, anger, exasperation and fatigue at the civilians who have died day after day at the hands of the police — and whose deaths are largely publicized — while the government stands idly by. Having gone through the cycle of emotions so many times, the feelings eventually cascaded into numbness, and it’s almost as if I’ve been desensitized to brutality against innocent citizens. Many politicians have condemned police aggression and mourned those lost, but these words have felt largely empty.
But for the first time, I have hope that palpable, large-scale, institutional reform is possible in California. Of course, AB 953 is not the end-all to the issue of police brutality in our state, but it could be the first pen stroke that begins a novel of greater change. Regardless, an observant, and deeply suspicious, population will be closely following the evolution — or lack thereof — in California’s law enforcement. It is, perhaps, good to be a skeptic, but as of now, it is even better to be an optimist.

So the bill hasn’t been implemented and we have no data but the author has already concluded that police brutality is exclusively the result of evil racist white men.  As though no other race ever abuses their police badges, ever.   Of course they can’t back up their racist claims with any facts or examples, that would be asking too much for a college student in this day and age.

We all know that Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, is beloved by scores of religious, and even secular, people around the world. His visit to the U.S. last week demonstrated that to a great extent. And, as of Nov. 27, rock fans around the world will have one more reason to love him. Next month, the People’s Pope will release, in collaboration with Believe Digital, an album entitled Wake Up!. 
I can’t say that I saw this coming. But I probably should have after seeing this viral picture of the pope about to drop some sick lines and presumably his bodyguard in the background about to provide him with the best beat ever. 
This Vatican-approved LP will feature sacred hymns and none other than the pope himself. His inspirational words from speeches he has delivered around the world will take center stage as enlivening musical accompaniments and Gregorian chants delight us as well.
After hearing “Wake up! Go! Go! Forward!”, a track from the album premiered in Rolling Stone, I have to be honest — I absolutely love it. The music’s uplifting lyrics and dramatic guitar opening moved me to tears. Well, almost moved me to tears. Come on, go! Forward! Hear it for yourself. 
This specific track contains words from a speech Pope Francis gave to a South Korean audience in English last year. The pope proclaimed, “No one who sleeps can sing, dance and rejoice.” Then, with a sort of beauty to the ears and touch to the heart, he urges each and every one of us to wake up and go do what we desire most. This, to me, is such a beautiful message. If I loved this specific track, I can’t wait to see how much I will love the others. The rest of the album will have tracks in other languages, among them Italian and Spanish, and talk about issues such as peace, dignity and the environment.
These issues seem well suited given that the Argentine pope has unified people from different religious, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds with his messages of acceptance for gay people, environmental protections for areas damaged by unsustainability and help for the homeless. It is this message of respect and love for every human being on this planet that will resound throughout this album. 
I do find myself sometimes being critical of the Church’s stance on certain issues, just like many people do. This album, however, is the right move on the part of the Vatican because I feel such a bigger connection with the pope himself. His message is universal, crossing the boundaries of different religious beliefs. So, on Nov. 27, buy this album because we all do need some inspiration once in a while.

The Martian is one of those films that comes along every once in a while that sets the bar for what an exceptional science fiction movie should be. Along with a star-studded cast, the appeal to a wide audience and strong pacing are what make this movie a must-see.
The Martian is about a mission on Mars gone wrong, resulting in a NASA team abandoning astronaut Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon, and leaving him for dead. In the spirit of keeping things interesting, however, Watney survives the disaster, and the movie follows his mission of returning to Earth alive despite the odds being stacked against him.
Aside from an interesting premise, there are several factors that keep the audience entertained from start to finish. The first is the inclusion of a large number of terrific actors. Aside from Damon, performances from Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Donald Glover, Sean Bean and others don’t disappoint. Having so many stars in a single film usually brings up the problem of someone not getting enough screen time, but that wasn’t the case in The Martian. All the actors had their moments to shine without stepping on any toes.
This included Damon himself, who proved that he can act as an astronaut who isn’t a selfish scumbag, unlike the character he played in Interstellar. His character is instantly likable right off the bat, which in turn makes his goal of getting back to Earth alive that much more compelling. Though his performance is strong throughout the movie, it’s not Oscar-worthy, as it just doesn’t have that “wow” factor. There  aren’t any standout scenes for Damon that would differentiate him from other incredible performances this year, like Tom Hardy’s portrayal of Mad Max.
To be fair, this isn’t completely Damon’s fault, and the only negative about this movie that comes to mind is the underscoring of most of the dramatic moments in the film. Despite the desperation and sheer helplessness that comes with Watney’s unfortunate situation, he seems to be in a mostly chipper mood throughout the entirety of the film. It’s important to keep a calm state of mind in a stressful event, but for someone who is in a situation as delicate and seemingly impossible as his, Watney seems to crack a few too many jokes. There are plenty of  opportunities for some really heart-wrenching and emotional moments in the film that are instead offset by moments that are admittedly funny, but it would have been nice to see more contrast on the emotional spectrum. Though there are scenes where something goes wrong and fear sets in, within several minutes everything returns to a state of normalcy, as if nothing bad happened in the first place. In fact, the overall tone of the movie makes it seem as if there isn’t any real danger at all sometimes, which there definitely is.
Though the movie handles tone poorly, just about everything else is incredible, especially the ability to appeal to a wide audience. Those who don’t know a thing about the field of astronomy or science in general can easily follow this movie’s plot without getting lost in the science. As the movie is heavily influenced by the exploration of space and other planets, audience members may find a newfound passion for astronomy. Being able to cater to both types of people without alienating one is no small task for a sci-fi movie, and the movie is able to accomplish this due to its fantastic pacing. For a movie that runs over two hours, it certainly didn’t feel like it. There are moments that are slower than others, but the film is never boring, and it never feels like it drags at any point. The main focus of the movie is simple enough, but there are enough events that happen to keep the audience attentive and curtail a yawn or a quick glance at a phone screen to see how much time has passed.
Overall, this movie is exceptional for a number of reasons, including its star-heavy cast who share the spotlight, a good performance from Matt Damon and wide appeal to various audiences due to excellent pacing. The only downside to this movie is the tone that somewhat negates the dramatic feelings associated with the premise of the film, but it’s hardly a reason why anyone would be hesitant to see this movie. The Martian is another great entry into the science-fiction genre and proves that it’s much more than a cheap Interstellar knock-off.

In the past, I always regretted never taking the time to collect my thoughts after festivals to really look back and appreciate my experience there as a whole. But this year, after attending the Austin City Limits Music Festival, I finally took the time to sit down and reflect. As I gathered my thoughts, I had major issues determining what exactly made this particular experience so special. ACL can be a place for interesting experiences, whether you’re a festival newbie or a seasoned attendee. I, however, am no festival amateur. I’ve traveled to Spain for Bilbao’s BBK Live; I’ve raved at Mexico City’s EDC and gotten the Coachella experience. Now, it was time to head to  the self-proclaimed live-music capital of the world. The result was a fantastic weekend in Zilker Park to end the 2015 festival season.
The Austin City Limits Music Festival is an annual three-day event in Austin featuring some of the most eclectic and major names in the music industry. My friends and I left Los Angeles Thursday evening and embarked on a three-hour flight to Austin. After reaching our destination, we woke to the arid heat the next day that eased into the warm haze. Before leaving, I had highlighted the artists I could not miss: Disclosure, Alabama Shakes, G-Eazy, Halsey and Borns, among others. To have only a handful of “must-sees” is the best way to go to a festival because it gives you the opportunity to see a variety of artists you would normally not be exposed to.
One thing struck me about ACL right off the bat: I have never seen so many children at a music festival. And though taking kids to a music festival is generally a bad idea, the crowd at ACL is on average older than those at other mega festivals. For the first time, I felt weird dancing in front of others — not that it stopped me, of course. Between the Austin Kiddie Limits stage, the available shade and green areas to play around, ACL provides families comfort without diminishing the experience. I mean, how bad can it be to see your kid jam out to the Foo Fighters?
A few hundred die-hard fans gathered around the gates before they opened at 11 a.m. sharp on Friday. The Star Wars theme played in the background as I chatted with another ACL first-timer who was accompanied by his brother, who had been to the festival about 10 times. The brothers said they came mainly for that night’s headliner, the Foo Fighters. I have never been a huge fan, but I was more than willing to see Dave Grohl live and that Game of Thrones seat he’s been performing in since a leg injury left him debilitated.
Friday began with a new discovery. Soul/pop band Jessica Hernandez & the Deltas were playing at the BMI stage and were fabulous and dreamy. Hernandez has a beautiful lush voice, framed perfectly by a band of Detroit rockers.  Midway through Jessica and the Delta’s performance, I decided to leave my friends to wander the fields on my own and went to check out a random stage. I walked into the enormous Samsung Galaxy Stage and was blown away by British rock duo, Royal Blood, who impressed the crowd with their chopping riffs and catchy choruses. When it comes to rock and roll, the British never cease to surprise. “Figure It Out” is now on my Spotify “feel good” playlist.
My friends and I found each other and continued on to watch Albert Hammond Jr. at the HomeAway stage. Hammond led his four-piece through a set of pop-rock gems from his recently released LP, Momentary Masters. The highlight was “Losing Touch.” The Strokes guitarist and his ensemble wrapped things up at 3:45 p.m., with a full 15 minutes of their schedule still available. At the front, die-hard fans chanted his name for an encore, but the show was over. They had to wait until Sunday to see Hammond again during the first weekend finale.
We finished on the Honda Stage with Disclosure, one of the most successful electronic duos in recent music history. I found myself in the crowd during their Friday set for my second time seeing them live in the past week. With a set list that balanced old and new, brothers Howard and Guy Lawrence showcased that they are more than a typical electronic artist. The visual spectacle, the projections and light shows were on point, highlighting the duo’s drum kits, strapped-on guitars and feisty vocals. The two heaviest dance tracks, “Bang That” and “When a Fire Starts to Burn,” turned the Honda Stage into a pulsing rabbit hole of rhythm. “Latch,” of course, was their last song. If Disclosure’s set had any disappointment, it was the lack of guests. But ACL attendees can always hope for weekend two.
The Austin City Limits music festival provides a family atmosphere that is conducive to an eye-opening experience. I entered the Zilker Park grounds thinking I was a festival expert, but I realized every day’s like a school day, and I still have a lot to learn about music festivals.
