The Undergraduate Student Government introduced several pieces of new and continuing legislation, including support for Palestinian students, and discussed payroll issues within USG, Tuesday evening.
In one of his final updates before the official transition to the new Areias-Warren administration, President Gabe Savage spoke about the current issues he plans to tackle with his time left, including payroll difficulties within USG. USG officers are no longer on the payroll and may only receive stipends, which can only be applied to tuition and if a Senator is “fully aided,” it may result in senators losing out on compensation, Savage said.
“I’ve been working on [payroll issues] since my first week in office,” Savage said. “This is something we cannot allow to continue. It effectively means that only certain students would be able to be in USG, and those students would be the ones who are more financially well off. It’s a barrier to entry. I think it’s a [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] issue at heart.”
The Palestinian Flag Resolution, which calls for the addition of the Palestinian flag to The Center for International and Public Affairs was also discussed during the meeting. Sen. Lennon Wesley III, said he was happy to see the sentiment after hearing from several students who demonstrated their support for the resolution.
“It was really touching to receive so many thoughts of students, and we definitely support you and appreciate your sentiment,” Wesley said.
Other senators also shared updates, including Sen. Maximillian Gomez on student coronavirus vaccinations and Sen. Alexis Areias on her Presidential transition.
The Senate will hear from Benjamin Morain, a junior majoring in political science, who is the nomination for Chief Justice of the Judicial Council by Savage, next week. Senators will also have the opportunity to question Morain prior to voting.

For about nine years of my life, I was a figure skater. Around the time that I began showing up to afternoon practices at the rink, the beloved 6th generation iPod had been released to music fans and Apple consumers everywhere. 
When you compete in figure skating, no matter in what form, you have a program set to music. Traditionally, there was a person at the rink that had the CD-burning know-how that could set you up with an edited song that fit the length and melodic needs of your program, and you would patiently wait in line at the hockey penalty box for it to be your turn to hear your program on the big speakers, slap on that yellow belt designating “this is MY program” and pour your heart out with your skating. 
The iPod then became the most popular choice for downloading program music on. It was so simple — my ice dancing coach Russ repurposed the phrase “plug and chug” just to send me off on my turn for a run-through. 
One day, Russ started playing a different song than I was normally used to for the Rocker Foxtrot, a mid-level dance with a 4/4 beat. The reason for this small and trivial change? The song was gone from iTunes — Russ’ library and the store itself — with no return in the cards.
Lamenting this may seem pointless, but there are many program songs that I’ve saved in my library to this day because reminiscing is a comforting practice from time to time. Half or more of the songs I skated to in my brief career, some that brought me immense joy in performance, were removed from iTunes and never saved to a CD and, without a reminder of their melodies, I lose the happy memories of performance as well. 
Can iTunes, or whatever remnants of it that still exist, take this away? Let’s ask a lawyer.
Apple’s henchmen of a legal counsel wrote the iTunes user agreement well, empowered by the general truth that the average person won’t read it before agreeing to it (otherwise known as an adhesion contract). When you buy something off of iTunes, or any Apple product, what you are buying is not ownership of the song, TV show, film, etc. You are buying a license to engage with it within non-transferable limits, which allows Apple, at any time, to “reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any iTunes Products, content, or other materials, comprising a part of the iTunes Service at any time without notice.”
Apple can do this through loopholes in the Federal Copyright Act of 1976. iTunes and its parent company “has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize the following: … distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.” That license that you purchase, which you are probably unaware of and are unable to negotiate for greater ownership of, is one of those authorized copies of the original work. 
OK, literally whatever. Who uses iTunes when we have streaming, the beacon of a new age of content consumption? 
This same issue came up in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California not even a full year ago — involving consumers streaming movies. Plaintiff Amanda Caudel (most likely picked out by the law firms representing this class action group) filed a complaint that Amazon Prime Video’s option to “Buy” a movie for almost $20 is designed to “deceive, mislead and defraud consumers.”
Their case is built on the notion that “reasonable consumers will expect that the use of a ‘Buy’ button and the representation that their video content is a ‘Purchase’ means that the consumer has paid for full access to the video content and, like any bought product, that access cannot be revoked.”
But Amazon has, and continues to, revoke this access to content that has been paid for under the guise of “buying it” instead of buying a licence — basing their reasoning on the fact that this differentiation is stated in the terms of agreement. And the court agreed with them.
This is just a snippet of the overall degradation of content consumption, especially for film. You ever go to Netflix or HBO Max and try to look for the first installment in the “Chucky” series only to find the god-awful “Cult of Chucky” movie? Or have you been waiting for what seems like years for “Sex and the City 2” to return to a platform that you are actually subscribed to?
The tumultuous mixing and mashing of product licensing and distribution agreements is only going to make this worse as time goes on, until one day your favorite Nickelodeon game show or anime is unable to be viewed except on VHS or DVD. Some of the most valuable films, TV shows and songs that shape our current popular culture memory are disappearing as quickly as we can sign up for another subscription service. Attached to them are personal memories, emotions and understandings that may be lost as well. 
I’m not saying that you should go log on to eBay and search for that somewhat-friendly looking VHS player that’ll bring you viewing satisfaction and faux social prestige. There’s a broader adhesion contract at play here, where we as the consumers have virtually no bargaining power over the streaming giants and hedge funds that mix up their licensing agreements every so often in their witches’ cauldrons. 
For the meantime though, snuggle up with your favorite “9 to 5” DVD a little closer tonight.

On International Women’s Day Monday night, influential women in the music industry, including USC alumna Saweetie, came together for the first Grammy Week event to share advice, insider insights into the behind-the-scenes of the music world and the changes in diversity necessary for the future of the industry.
Harvey Mason Jr., the new president of the Recording Academy, kicked off the evening with an important message about the future of the Academy.
“Women in the Mix is a celebration of the gifts that women and women-identifying people bring to this industry and the power that comes when we support, mentor and create opportunities for greatness,” Mason said. “We take very seriously the responsibility to be leaders through our initiatives, programming and partnerships.” 
After Mason’s initial message, the event shifted focus to an entirely female-focused energy, beginning with a performance by composer, producer, writer and professional pianist Chloe Flower. 
Flower performed her song “No Limit” and wowed virtual attendees with her impeccable piano skills backed by a driving beat and produced sound.
One of the most potent announcements of the night was the Recording Academy’s pledge to donate $25,000 to various organizations that support the growth of women and girls in the music industry. 
Many of these organizations, such as the Berklee Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice and We Are Moving the Needle, were started by women in the industry who wanted to pass down their skills. The latter was started by American mastering engineer Emily Lazar, who is currently nominated for three Grammys. The organization will be giving eight full scholarships to female-identifying producers and engineers to pursue those careers.
One of the discussions that stood out was between Grammy-nominated rapper and DJ, MC Lyte, and renowned percussionist and vocalist, Sheila E. They each have spent eight to nine years in the L.A. chapter of the Recording Academy.
“If you want something to happen and you want change, you have to be a part of it,” Sheila E. said.
MC Lyte and Sheila E. each offered their unique, yet similar experiences in a male-dominated industry. Sheila E. discussed working with female engineers since the ’80s, but they were never given much recognition. MC Lyte was in the world of hip-hop and her experience lacked female representation.
“[In] the land of hip hop, it’s very rare that you would have a woman who’s an engineer behind the board when you have a lot of male producers who choose to work with other men,” MC Lyte said.
According to the USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, currently, only 2.6% of producers and engineers across the music industry are women.
Beyond the lack of representation, some women discussed the sexism they have experienced and their treatment compared to their male counterparts. Sheila E. mentioned how people told her she was not good enough and implied she had acquired success through seduction. This is the unfortunate reality of women in the music industry.
Another notable moment was an interview with Ingrid Andress, who is nominated this year as one of the best new artists. She emphasized the importance of female mentorship as well as her hope to bring an emotional, introspective female perspective back to country music.
“I think we need a little more female perspective on what it looks like now to be a modern female,” Andress said. “A lot of the songs were describing women in cut-off jeans and pickup trucks, and I was just like, well, that’s not me, so I think we need more stories of how women like me are feeling.” 
Andress also acknowledged how the current female stars of country music are comfortable in their niches and can support each other without a sense of competition. Unfortunately, the public expectation is often the opposite.
“I think, sometimes, we as women have been programmed by society to think that we have to compare ourselves to one another,” Andress said.
Other panels included three very influential audio engineers (among other talents), EveAnna Manley, Piper Payne and Ebonie Smith. They discussed the moments they got set on their passion for the music industry and their views on continued learning.
“I like to say all the time [that] I am neck-deep in engineering and production with about 15 years of experience now, and I’m nowhere,” Smith said. “Because the field is like the ocean … what excites me the most is the curiosity behind the music-making process that keeps me inspired and engaged every day.” 
One of the highlights of the night was an interview between USC Annenberg graduate and superstar Saweetie and Elaine Welter of The Talk, CBS, Teen Vogue and The New York Times bestsellers list.
Saweetie covered a variety of topics, from her half-introvert, half-extrovert personality to her Bay Area roots. 
“[People from the Bay] are not mainstream at all … I hear all the time, ‘Saweetie just always finds a way to grow on me.’ So I think it’s like an acquired taste, just like an acquired sound,” Saweetie said.
She touched on her recent hit, “Best Friend,” featuring Doja Cat. This starring collaboration focuses on a female friendship, a rarer topic in music than one might think.
“I just wanted to dedicate a song to all of the best friends out there — because we needed that,” Saweetie said. “And I love how men are relating to it as well. Best friends are really important. We all need that person to hold us down.” 
She hinted at a future in-studio collaboration and named H.E.R. (also from the Bay Area) and Rihanna as her dream collaborations. Saweetie also touched on her new Icy Baby Foundation as a beginning to her philanthropic goals. She considers Missy Elliot to be closest to a mentor, as she looks up to her writing skills, versatility and overall creativity.
As a USC alumna, Saweetie studied communication and business and says her degree taught her how to deal with different types of people and how to negotiate. Her parting advice was a perfect summary of the incredibly positive energy and messaging of the night:
“You shouldn’t try to be like me. You should try to be like you, and hopefully, I can inspire you to be the best version of you, because I know what it feels like to be a little girl wanting to be something else,” Saweetie said. “It takes away the focus from the true prize, which is yourself. So, you know, learn your strengths, perfect your weaknesses, and be you.”

I can’t believe it’s March again. This month marks one year since in-person classes were canceled at USC due to the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, many students thought the virus would be gone in a few weeks, including yours truly. Oh, how naive I was.
Faced with this anniversary,I couldn’t help but feel nostal- gic about life before the virus. Stuck in my childhood home, I spent a good deal of post-March 2020 scavenging through my childhood possessions, eventu- ally finding my old Nintendo DS. It rapidly consumed my waking hours as I played through every single DS game I owned.
So imagine my surprise when Nintendo announced a remake of “Pokémon Diamond Version” and “Pokémon Pearl Version.”
For those of you who don’t know, a remake in the gaming world is when a studio gets an
old, popular game and remakes it with the newest technology, improving graphics and gener-al mechanics. Usually, the over- all plot remains the same, but there are some exceptions. In terms of the Pokémon games, Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl were originally released back in 2006 for the Nintendo DS. And while they introduced a lot of new features, such as inter- net play and a whopping 107 new Pokémon, they were also the first Pokémon games I ever played.
Naturally, I was excited to re- visit them, even with the ques- tionable art style they decided to adopt. But when I turned on my PS4 and started playing “Final Fantasy VII remake,” I noticed something strange. Are we get- ting too many remakes?
Sure, Pokémon and Final Fantasy are the first ones that come to mind, but let’s not for- get “Resident Evil 3”, “Demon’s Souls,” “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2” and even “Spongebob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom- Rehydrated.” All of these remakes — and so many more like them — were released with- in the last year. I can’t help but ask…why?
There is no clear answer to this question, although I’d bet video game companies are trying to capitalize on nostalgia. After all, the games that are being re- made were all originally released around the 2000s. This means that the teens who played them back then are now young adults who can buy games for them- selves. So, from a purely econom- ic lens, it makes total sense to cater to that audience and pro- vide them with a chance to re- live the experience they remem- ber having. And if sales numbers are anything to go by, this strat- egy is definitely paying off. But what can this mean for the world of esports?
Well, it depends. Usually, with a setup like this, you might ex- pect me to say something like, “esports should adopt older games.” But that isn’t the lesson we should learn. What remakes prove to us isn’t that old video games are better, but that nos- talgia is a powerful factor in the gaming sphere. And if the esports scene taps into its history just a little bit, you might see an in- credible result.
An easy way to promote his- tory is to emulate the feeling
of past tournaments. In other words, a tournament environ- ment without a lot of special ef- fects and sellout arena crowds, but rather focusing on enhancing the feeling of community.
One possible way to do this is simply to run multiple tourna- ments simultaneously. In oth-er words, instead of renting out small venues to run individual events that lead up to a grand tournament, promoting compa- nies could rent out exposition halls where all the minor tour- naments are held at the same time. This would not only save companies a lot of money and time (since they wouldn’t haveto rent out multiple venues and deal with the logistics of running them), but it would also likely guarantee a better profit. After all, fans would only have to at- tend one event instead of many. The simultaneous tournaments would also guarantee no sin-
gle room would be jam-packed, as attendees would spread out throughout the venue to watch different events.
Another way to capitalize on nostalgia would be to involve for- mer esports stars more regularly. By giving them the spotlight once
more, esports fans and attendees would be able to relive childhood memories and, in many cases, meet their idols for the first time. For the pros, this would also be an incredible opportunity to step into the competitive scene again with people of similar skill lev- els. Companies could even pit the newer generation against the old- er, creating a “clash of the ages” tournament that can cross over and appeal to target audiences.
While we might see nostalgia as a cheap gimmick to bring in older audiences, these examples show that relying on this feeling can lead to innovation in the industry. New tournament for- mats, utilization of retired athletes, a heightened sense of community — all of these things can be seen as a “cash grab.” But if implemented successfully, these concepts can be permanent additions to the esports landscape. And, much like remakes, they would allow us to celebrate the rich history of professional gaming in an authentic way.

Close but no cigar for the No. 24 Trojans.
Head coach Andy Enfield and his team watched their hopes of bringing USC its first conference championship since 1985 slip through their fingertips when the Oregon Ducks dismantled Oregon State 80-67 and secured the Pac-12 title with a 14-4 conference record Sunday afternoon. While USC took care of business against UCLA the day prior to Oregon’s win, the Beavers were unable to do USC a favor by beating Oregon.
Despite winning a Pac-12 best 15 games, the Trojans sit at the No. 2 seed, with recent losses to No. 23 Colorado and Utah dimin- ishing their title chances.
“We are really excited for our basketball team, how they’ve handled themselves all sea- son,” Enfield said after the game Saturday. “Every team has their ups and downs through a long basketball season. We had a few tough games last week on the road, but we bounced back.”
Now, all eyes will be on the Utah-Washington game slated for Wednesday. USC will play the winner of that matchup in the quarterfinals.
The Trojans would likely love to see No. 10 seed Washington upset No. 7 seed Utah, as Enfield’s squad has already picked up two dominant wins against the Huskies this season. USC simply has too much size down low for the Huskies to handle. Freshman forward Evan Mobley and sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley gave the Huskies frontcourt problems in two matchups this season. Senior forward Chevez Goodwin has also gotten into the action against Washington,
averaging 11.5 points per game in USC’s two wins against the Huskies.
On the other hand, Utah split the season series with the Trojans,
handing them a disheartening loss late in the season that made the climb to the conference ti- tle even steeper. Utah head coach Larry Krystkowiak does a great
job of game planning and prepar- ing his players for their matchups. In both of Utah’s matches against USC, the Utes held the focal point of the Trojan’s offense, Mobley, to
just two field goals.If Utah were to advance to the
quarterfinals, Mobley will have to figure out different ways to be ef- fective on the court. The 19-year old superstar was voted the Pac-12 Player of the Year, Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, and the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, becoming the first player in Conference histo- ry to take home all three accolades.
Mobley doesn’t have to score 20 points if the Trojans want to taste the semifinals, but he will have to be the best player on the floor, whether that comes through his playmaking or rebounding and defense.
Beating Utah or Washington would most likely pit the Trojans up against another familiar foe, the Buffaloes. Colorado hand- ed USC two of its six losses this season, including another disap- pointing loss late in the season that cost USC a shot at the top seed in the conference tourna- ment. Enfield, who was recently voted Pac-12 Coach of the Year, will have his hands full trying to game plan for all Pac-12 first team guard McKinley Wright IV. Wright’s dynamic scoring and two-way play has propelled the Buffaloes to the third seed in the Pac-12.
No matter who the Trojans face, they are going to have to tread carefully over the next week. The Pac-12 is filled with teams hungry for a chance to compete in the NCAA tourna- ment, so USC cannot afford slop- py play, missed free throws or a lack of focus.
“It’s going to be very challeng- ing, it’s going to be a long two weeks or three weeks,” Enfield said. “We know what’s at stake, and we wouldn’t have it any other way. We want to be there.”
Enfield and company face the winner of Utah-Washington Thursday at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Tip-off is at 5:30 p.m.

The Senate-revised version of President Joe Biden’s pandemic stimulus bill has returned to the House floor. Democrats have the votes to get the bill passed, and Republicans know this. But this is Washington, so of course this is not the end of the story. 
Democrats are on a tight deadline as certain unemployment benefits are set to expire on March 14. Republicans have taken advantage of this, launching attacks against “politically motivated” portions of the bill. Some of their attacks have been successful, including removing infrastructure projects in New York and California from the bill. The time constraints, as well as a ruling by the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian have also led Democrats to back off a proposed $15 federal minimum wage.
During the bill’s Senate debate, Republicans also introduced targeted amendments to divide Democratic ranks over polemic votes. All 50 Democrats stood united in voting for the bill, but for some, the price was steep. Republicans now have footage of many Democrats’ uncomfortable votes on tape; priceless footage for campaign ads when election season rolls around. 
What gets lost in the hyper-politicized environment of Washington is the constructive debate and policymaking that ultimately seeks the best interests of the people. Both parties are responsible for the emergence and exacerbation of such an environment, although it must be recognized that people on both sides of the aisle have also tried to mend it. 
A good example is Biden’s recent discussion with moderate Republicans at the White House. While the meeting could be criticized as a “political show” without tangible results, its spirit should nonetheless be commended.
Now, we will attempt to have the frank policy discussion that so often escapes our politicians. So without further ado, what are the benefits and consequences of Biden’s stimulus bill?
$1.9 trillion is a lot of money to inject into the economy. After all, we are talking about the second-largest stimulus bill in the history of the United States. An obvious positive of such a stimulus is more growth. However, growth can come at a price. 
Unchecked growth can lead to overheating — Republicans’ top concern. Overheating occurs when supply in an economy surpasses demand, and it can lead to all sorts of inefficiencies that make long-term growth unsustainable. 
Growth can also lead to inflation, which, in a country as reliant on imports as the U.S., can mean higher prices. This has a negative impact on households, especially when wages do not keep up with inflation (which becomes more pertinent now that the minimum wage increase has been scrapped from the bill). It also has a negative impact on retirement savings.
Depending on whether demand for the USD keeps up with inflation and how this relates to the demand for foreign currencies, inflation can also mean a hit to the USD’s purchasing power. This harms the U.S. financial sector, as well as all industries that rely on foreign supply chains. Most consequentially, it could potentially lead to capital flight, although this is highly unlikely for an economy as well-positioned, diversified, and robust as the U.S.’s.
However, a weaker currency also has positive impacts on domestic manufacturing, agriculture and other exports, which become more competitive. The U.S. has an enormous trade deficit, so such an event would be a healthy step toward rebalancing trade relations. It would reduce the U.S.’ dependence on imports, and provide new opportunities for growth in tradable sectors. 
Speculative markets have already taken note of Biden’s stimulus. The volatility in the stock and bond markets in recent weeks directly results from its anticipation. Treasury bond yields are on the rise, even after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the Fed does not plan to raise interest rates or engage in other inflation-curbing austerity measures anytime soon. 
The rise of Treasury bond yields has prompted investors to take out their money from the stock market, and invest it in bonds instead. Growth stocks, such as the majority of the tech sector, are especially susceptible to outflows caused by the rise in bond yields. 
The rise of Treasury bond yields has also increased mortgage rates, which now top 3% for the first time since July. Higher mortgage rates negatively affect people’s ability to buy homes or refinance their mortgages.
The nature of the pandemic crisis has had uneven impacts across the economy, hitting certain sectors and affecting Black, Indigenous and communities of color more severely. This necessitates a more targeted stimulus bill, or else risks of overheating are exacerbated. The question is: how targeted should it be? According to Republicans, the stimulus should be as targeted as possible. According to Biden, the consequences of a relief package that is too small are greater and more pressing than the risks of a package that is too large.  
I ultimately agree with Biden’s judgment. 46% of American households report serious financial problems caused by the pandemic, suggesting a widespread problem that might touch on more economic sectors than many might expect. That inflation will stem from reopening once Biden’s vaccination campaign is successful might be inevitable, but the Fed believes this inflation will be passerby, not here to stay. 
Only hindsight will tell us if the stimulus’s size was appropriate. What is undeniable however, is that the nature of the pandemic crisis is unprecedented, and that too many people are facing tangible pain. Throwing away political motivations without turning a blind eye to what the future might bring, the best thing we can do today is match the moment.

Logging in and out of Zoom classes is unquestionably exhausting in comparison to in-person classes. Nearly all students would rather traverse a university quad than open a file on their computer. Zoom is an obstacle for numerous reasons — excessive screen time, social isolation, and limited access to classroom resources, just to name a few. However, with all the negatives of Zoom and education during the pandemic in mind, there are clear benefits of remote learning, namely the development of better online learning. 
In the United States, education is more important than ever. From 1992 to 2016, the amount of jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree has increased from 18 to 25%. On average, people with bachelor’s degrees earn $1,173 weekly compared to $712 earned by those with no college degree. Universities have capitalized on the desirability of a college degree in the U.S. as the average institutional cost has increased from $11,138 in 1985 to $23,835 in 2017.
If education is the path to upward mobility, its high cost is a clear barrier for financial growth and equity. Zoom is an answer to that. While the argument can be made that a spot in a lecture or dorm room is worth the exorbitant price, a Zoom lecture should be far cheaper and have fewer barriers to entry. Additionally, online classes have no logistical barriers; global connection is completely possible and, thanks to a simple recording function, classes can be accessed in any time zone.
While online education has been accessible since the Information Age in the late 20th century, a degree of distance between online and traditional college has always existed. It’s contested whether virtual education can hold up to in-person classes.
One visionary, in particular, is leading the charge in terms of virtual education — Sal Khan. Khan has a powerful and expansive vision for the future of education, and one cornerstone is accessibility. Even before a pandemic mandated it, Khan focused on free, intuitive and remote education.
Beyond Zoom classes, the entire concept of a four-year collegiate experience is being called into question due to the pandemic. Considering that many regard a college education as a means to an end, weighing qualifications and procuring a degree over the residential and extracurricular aspects of a university, the opportunity for students to learn remotely would cut costs for many. While some lament the social losses caused by a transition to virtual learning, offering education that doesn’t force a student to pay additional hidden costs in room and board is a positive step to making college more affordable.
Data is another benefit of Zoom; it’s easy to quantify remote classes and obtain information on students and their general learning tendencies. Forbes said that “The best [educational] models are built to take in a wealth of data on student learning to drive continuous improvement of the learning experience.” According to Harvard Business Review, this data can be used to determine which classes can be taken remotely and which necessitate in-person instruction. 
Large introductory-level lectures are key candidates for virtual learning. In a classroom environment that already has minimal student participation, a switch to remote learning could increase distribution and increase overall student capacity, creating more space and access to education.
Zoom changed the game completely. Now in-person colleges are required to justify their tuition costs for virtual school, as they find themselves offering a nearly identical product. While a return to pre-coronavirus times is central to each university’s promise, the necessity to teach with the resources available has created strides in online education.
Considering Zoom and the educational field in the U.S., one must ask a fundamental question: is education truly about enrichment and growth for all, or is it an exclusive club designed to filter out those who can’t afford it? Make no mistake, a university is a corporation of sorts; however, at this point, the business model directly undermines the opportunities of others.
