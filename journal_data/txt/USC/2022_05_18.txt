No. 13 men’s tennis competed in a hard-fought battle against No. 4 Ohio State in the Super Regionals of the NCAA Men’s Tennis Championship in Columbus on Saturday but ultimately fell to the Buckeyes 2-4. 
Following a 4-0 sweep against Nevada in the first round and a 4-1 victory over No. 17 San Diego in the second round at Marks Stadium in Los Angeles, the Trojans advanced to the NCAA Round of 16 for the 15th straight time. The loss to Ohio State snapped a 12-match winning streak for the Trojans. They finished the season with a record of 23-6.
Head Coach Brett Masi said the team came a long way this season and expressed his pride in his players. 
“I thought we were a very lethal team,” said Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They were playing their best tennis come April … We fought hard, but we just came up short.”
USC won its third-straight Pac-12 Tournament title at Libbey Park in Ojai, Calif. which gained it an automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament. It defeated No. 53 California, No. 18 Stanford and No. 40 Washington to clinch its sixth overall trophy at the conference tournament. Stanford and Washington also made the NCAA tournament but lost in the Round of 16 and first round, respectively.
“It definitely feels good to feel like we’re making our mark in the Pac-12 and saying that the road has to go through us,” Masi said. In the match against the Buckeyes, the Trojans fell in doubles for the first time in eight matches. No. 7 ranked junior Stefan Dostanic and senior Bradley Frye opened with a 5-0 start against Buckeyes’ No. 2 ranked pair graduate student Matej Vocel and junior Robert Cash in doubles competition. When USC fell to Ohio State 1-6 on courts two and three, play was suspended on court one, and the Buckeyes took the first point of the match. 
“[Frye and Dostanic] are our captains,” Masi said. “[Dostanic’s] relentless … He wants to see everyone be successful and work hard … [Frye] can come and work hard and improve and get to a place where he’s playing number two in the lineup on a top 10 team. It’s just very impressive to see.” 
The Trojans came out strong for singles play, winning the first sets on four courts, but the Buckeyes bounced back to reclaim second sets on three of those four courts. On court six, Ohio State junior Justin Boulais took down USC junior Ryder Jackson 6-4, 6-1. On court five, however, USC sophomore No. 121 Lodewijk Weststrate defeated Buckeye senior James Trotter 6-0, 6-4 to make the match 2-1 in favor of Ohio State.
No. 7 Dostanic’s 19-match win streak came to an end in a three-set battle against Ohio State junior No. 9 Cannon Kingsley. Kingsley came back for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win giving the Buckeyes a 3-1 advantage over the Trojans. No. 105 Frye came back to extend the match against No. 13 Vocel winning 5-7, 6-4, 6-2. The match point came on court four. Ohio State graduate No. 122 Jake Van Emburgh took down USC freshman Ryan Colby 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. 
“I think it’s really exciting, and it’s a good experience for everyone on our team,” said Frye when asked about the environment in Columbus. “That made us look forward to next year. To see how we finished off with the group that we had, three freshman, I think it’s really special.”
Masi said he thought this match was a great environment for the young team to experience a quality opponent and the atmosphere around it.
Next season, the Trojans are “going to play a lot tougher schedule than we did this year,” Masi said. “If we can win some of those [matches], we’re going to put ourselves in that top eight and give ourselves a great seeding. I’m looking forward to that road for us for sure.”  
Although USC has finished the NCAA team competition, the season is not over yet. Dostanic, Makk and Frye will compete in NCAA Individual play next week. Dostanic and Makk qualified for the NCAA Singles draw, and Dostanic and Frye will compete in the NCAA Doubles. They compete May 23-28 in Champaign, Ill.

The latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” premiered last week, raking in $450 million opening weekend globally. The film sees Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) face off against Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) in full Scarlet Witch mode. Watching Wanda live up to her full villain potential does not disappoint; the film takes the Marvel villain role farther than it has ever been before.
Doctor Strange trades in his independent and highly sarcastic nature to save a girl from malevolent forces that want her powers. This is the introduction of America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), a teenager capable of jumping between multiverses when she is in fear. Gomez is endearing and natural in her role as Chavez, but the introduction of the new character is hard to fully embrace amid the outrageous twists of the film’s plot. Audiences get an entertaining taste of Cumberbatch’s acting range as they encounter different versions of Dr. Strange in alternate universes with some splashy cameos that are just as random as they are comical.
Sam Raimi, who made his MCU directorial debut with the film, sets himself apart from other directors as he does not include all the signature tropes and stylistic choices that usually come with a Marvel movie. Known for his directorial work with both the original Spider-Man films and the Evil Dead franchise, audiences were met with a surprising amount of horror-genre elements, much to the shock and delight of fans.
Olsen is quite literally a monster. Her portrayal of the Scarlet Witch takes the Marvel villain archetype to a new level with a shocking death count for an MCU film. With black-stained fingers and the iconic, blood-red crown headpiece, Wanda’s pain and suffering from the loss of her self-fabricated children from ‘Wandavision’ shine through the character’s alter ego thanks to Olsen’s powerful acting skills.
Danny Elfman brings some nostalgia to the film with a spooky and thrilling score that serves as a breath of fresh air in the MCU. One particular track towards the end of the film involves a tribute to classical composers in the midst of a mind-blowing battle scene between Doctor Strange and his evil alter ego from another universe. It’s fun to have such an unpredictable inclusion of classical music in such a massive superhero franchise film — indeed, at certain points, it’s easy to forget that this is an MCU film at all.
The atmosphere and tone of the film is so eerie that it becomes bizarre and hilarious when Raimi’s cheesy horror elements and ‘80s-esque dialogue ensue. The film’s sentimentality is often corny, attributing back to Raimi’s emotional Spider-Man films and their ruminations on responsibility. Raimi incorporates a lot of this contemplation of morality in the film as Doctor Strange explores what is truly important in life. He battles with his past failures, especially his decisions in “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame” and his relationship with Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). The scenes between the two are as cliché as ever, and audiences experience a softer side of Doctor Strange — the relationship arc as a whole is reminiscent of the central couple from the original Spider-Man films.
In the end, “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” isn’t as much of a Marvel film as it is Raimi’s game. It seems he had the time of his life taking the MCU on a cheesy and pretty gorey spin, despite the legendary franchise having no history with such elements. The question remains whether it was refreshing and shocking for fans or if they are just too far removed from the iconic themes of the MCU.

To no one’s surprise, Bad Bunny released another album that effortlessly balances personal intimacy and cultural specificity. “Un Verano Sin Ti,” beyond being an excellent Caribbean summer playlist, is a 23-track project that encourages diasporic joy, perreo and rest.
Divided into Side A and Side B, the tracklist features iconic Puerto Rican artists, such as pioneer Tony Dize who shines on “La Corriente” and Chencho from reggaeton duo Plan B, along with modern acts Jhay Cortez and Rauw Alejandro. As Bad Bunny’s longest project to date, the album encompasses all of the emotions felt during a summer of love and longing.
“It’s like when you go out to party, you’re excited, but then you get drunk and sentimental,” the Boricua artist said in an interview with Puerto Rican comedian Chente Ydrach.
Bad Bunny was named Spotify’s most-streamed artist for the past two years in a row, and each of his full-length albums — which have collectively fused old-school reggaeton, trap, pop punk, rock and more — have garnered significant acclaim. Different from the pressure cooker that reflected the anticipation for this album, the project itself is much more leisure-centric.
That carefree, cool Caribbean nature shined through on alternative tracks that featured more indie artists such as Bomba Estéreo on “Ojitos Lindos,” Buscabulla on “Andrea” and The Marías on “Otro Atardecer.”
The album’s length afforded the Boricua artist time to experiment even further with genre and show the range of which he is capable. The album comes alive with throwback trap on “Dos Mil 16” and mambo on “Después de la Playa,” reminiscent of great live albums past and reverberating with the warmth of a room pulsing with movement.
As much as the album is musically significant, Benito’s hyperlocal touchpoints and politically charged nods are — yet again — what makes it great. “Andrea” was initially speculated to be about the tragic case of Andrea Ruiz, who was a victim of femicide in Puerto Rico. Although that theory has been disputed, it still remains a powerful song, featuring Raquel Berrios, touching on the realities of being a woman on the island where domestic violence and femicide have been on the rise.
“El Apagón” is loudly patriotic, but not absent from island reality. In April, Puerto Rico experienced an islandwide blackout, the most recent of a series of outages following damage to its electrical grid by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Through a blend of reggaeton and house music, this track stands out in its ability to find the energy to celebrate while reflecting on the realities of continued colonization of the island.
Bad Bunny’s girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri, is featured on the song’s outro where she touches on the exploitation of Puerto Rico as a tax haven for American outsiders: “Lo que me pertenece a mí se lo quedan ellos / Que se vayan ellos / Esta es mi playa, este es mi sol.”
“Un Verano Sin Ti” truly captures the nature of longing — it provides a sonic push and pull that captures the sun-tired exhaustion that follows hours of beachside joy, the feeling of sore muscles during a never ending night of dancing.
The album, above all, reminds listeners that the Caribbean diaspora is not unfamiliar with finding peace amid changes, currents and chaos, as Berrios sings in “Andrea”: “Que digan lo que sea / Yo subo y bajo como la marea.”

“As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective.”
Set against the backdrop of a quick beat, these are the opening words of Kendrick Lamar’s pre-album track, “The Heart Part 5.” In preparation for the release of his album, “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers,” Lamar already inundates the listener with the soulful wisdom of his writing in the first few lines.
Just in this first line, Lamar managed to express an unavoidable truth about the human experience — each person has their own perspective on life. That is what his latest album is about — exploringhis humanity through his experiences and perspective.
The idea that human experience varies with perspective is reinforced in the opening of “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers” with the first song, “United in Grief.” The song closes with Lamar saying “I grieve different,” followed by “everybody grieves different.”
Lamar addressing the grief’s universality while also recognising the individual responses to grief reinforces the idea that each person’s perspective is unique, and that human life views will vary. This overarching view of the human experience is what makes Lamar the lyrical genius he is; however, he is not the first literary figure to emphasize the ideas of individuality and perspective.
May 14 marks the 97th anniversary of Virginia Woolf’s masterpiece, “Mrs. Dalloway.” Another story heavily centralized on the human implications of perspective, “Mrs. Dalloway” takes place in a single day focusing on various events as perceived through the lenses of different characters. As Mrs. Dalloway prepares for a party, the story shifts to the mindsets of the people she passes on the street and dives into their perspectives and emotions in that moment.
The constant shifting of perspective between characters serves to show the fluidity of time and highlight how, on some baseline level, there is an interconnectedness between human lives.
One of the novel’s most common motifs refers back to the main character, Clarissa Dalloway, and her connection to Shakespeare. On multiple occasions, she is seen referencing Shakespeare’s play “Cymbeline,” quoting “Fear no more the heat o’ the sun, / Nor the furious winter’s rages.”
To further understand the context of this quote, a brief understanding of “Cymbeline” is necessary. “Cymbeline,” one of Shakespeare’s final plays, is a story about deceit, pursuit and seduction at its core. The line quoted in “Mrs. Dalloway” is further expanded in the play to say “Fear no more the heat o’ the sun, / Nor the furious winter’s rages … Golden lads and girls all must, / As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.”
That final line is key to understanding the novel’s discussion of perspective and circularity of time. Regardless of individual experiences, humans are united in the fact that we must all eventually come to dust. This understanding places life in an even wider perspective, prompting the question: What difference do the small details of individual experience make?
It is the little things, tangible or short lived that obsess human minds — but, in the end, they all mean very little.
These artists hold that life is temporal, so the motivating forces influencing actions in our life need to serve a larger purpose than instant satisfaction in a single moment.
Lamar alludes to this idea on multiple occasions, stating in “We Cry Together” that “This is what the world sounds like” as he proceeds to fight with featured artist Taylour Paige for five minutes in what is ultimately a circular argument.
Human emotion dictates human life, and, because of this, we run in circles. Emotions are a powerful thing because, on the other hand, they also dictate our perspective on life, an inevitable fact for every person.
Like Lamar says in “The Heart Part 5,” “my perspective may differ from yours,” but that difference is necessary for growth and human development.
Life and its temporality are inevitable, so understanding the unique journeys and perspectives of different people is what will lead to a solid foundation for human nature.
In one poignant line, Lamar states “tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over.” That is the point all these artists have been trying to make: Life goes on in the end, so each person must live fully to understand and internalize their own perspective.

One month ago, Kendrick Lamar went on Twitter. He found a tweet that read: “Kendrick Lamar is officially retired.” Lamar quote tweeted it with a link that announced an album release date.
Less than a month later, he’s back with his first album since 2017’s “DAMN.” “Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers” is unlike any Lamar album before. It’s heavy in storytelling at times with raw emotion in “We Cry Together” and sees Lamar unafraid to critique his own views on the LGBTQIA+ community in “Auntie Diaries.”
But, after all, it’s another Lamar album full of messages under blurred lines and standout songs.
King Kenny is back.
Adam Jasper: Where do we start? It’s really easy to be comparative with such an established artist with a discography that places him among hip-hop’s greats. Perhaps the best aspect of “Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers” is its distinction from Lamar’s previous works. It doesn’t sound too much like anything he’s done before, it was a refreshing first listen. The production is immersive, leaning on the piano as a primary instrument. The guest features, some very unexpected, worked very well in their respective roles — Kodak Black on “Silent Hill” and Summer Walker on “Purple Hearts” to name a few. This album reminds us just how good Lamar is at curating a cohesive and unique project.
Anthony Gharib: I agree that this new project is very distinct from Lamar’s other albums. That’s what makes him so special. You never truly know what you’re going to get, even if he sprinkles in some familiar sounds from past work. The production of this album really stood out to me on first listen. From the intro “United In Grief,” the soft piano keys in the back before the beat switch midway through the track are outstanding. And oh man, that Kodak feature — the beat is so bouncy and Kodak really does a good job of holding his own. I enjoyed the first side of the album more than the second side though.
AJ: To me, the two sides blended together a bit — I didn’t prefer one over the other. Both balanced easy listening tracks like “N95’’ and “Savior” — rap songs with more traditional hip-hop beats and structures — with weighted works like “We Cry Together” and “Mother I Sober.” But Lamar isn’t one to waste time. None of the tracks are devoid of meaning. Much of his time is spent discussing what he perceives to be society’s flaws, whether that be “clout-chasing,” toxicity in relationships or hypocrisy in pandemic times. Along with these critiques are Lamar’s introspective self-criticism. The album serves as his own personal therapy session in that way, and for that reason, it’s a heavy listen. 
AG: I’m sure you can agree “We Cry Together” is by far the most powerful song on the album. The track’s raw emotion is overwhelming at times, but it’s outstanding work, something rappers today just don’t do anymore. You can feel every ounce of emotion through the words. Taylour Paige kills it. Her feature is just one of many fire ones on the album. Blxst on “Die Hard” was also outstanding. Hearing the “I hope I’m not too late to set my demons straight” in his voice is so soothing. In the weirdest feature of 2022, Summer Walker and Ghostface Killah actually work together on “Purple Hearts.” I expected more from Baby Keem on “Savior,” but the “Are you happy for me? ” singing is catchy enough to save it. Keem’s performance on “Savior (Interlude)” makes up for it, too. Sampha on “Father Time” matches Lamar’s vibe perfectly and steals the show. That’s my favorite song of the album, hands down. It also has arguably the most memorable lyric — “When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused.” Yeah, same. 
AJ: You definitely highlighted some of my favorite moments on the album. There’s just so much good to rave about. But there’s, of course, controversy to discuss, namely on one of my favorite tracks “Auntie Diaries.” Lamar addresses his past issues with transphobia, telling the tale of an uncle and a cousin who both transitioned (“My auntie is a man now”). To do this, he calls himself out for using the f-slur and draws a parallel by pointing out his hypocrisy of policing the usage of the n-word whilst using the f-slur (“‘F—-t, f—-t, f—-t,’ we can say it together / But only if you let a white girl say ‘N—a’”). Yeah, it’s a lot to unpack. While I don’t agree with the use of the slur to demonstrate his point, it’s important that Lamar addressed transphobia, a pertinent issue in hip-hop circles. Characteristically, he doesn’t shy away from controversy on the album.
AG: And that’s what makes Lamar one of the greatest rappers of all time. He’s not afraid to address controversial topics while making songs you can jam out to. There truly aren’t any rappers like Lamar anymore. On “Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers,” you understand why because of his strong storytelling and radiant rapping. A tendency of Lamar is that his albums almost always sound better over time. So, if you find yourself disliking it after a few listens, return after two or three weeks. There’s too much to unpack for someone to enjoy it after just one listen. But, I can speak for so many when I say it was refreshing to listen to Lamar again. Let’s hope this isn’t his final album.

If USC baseball wanted to make a late-season run at the Pac-12 tournament, it was crucial that they win some games against Washington. 
Unfortunately, missed opportunities were the theme of the weekend, and the Trojans lost three-straight frustratingly close games against the Huskies. 
“We’ve got to get better all the way around. We’re in last place in the Pac-12, so I think there’s no question that we need to get better at pitching, defense and offensively, and we’re in the process of making those improvements,” Head Coach Jason Gill said. 
In the first game of the series, the Trojan pitching was excellent. Sophomore right-hander Jaden Agassi had an excellent start, going five and one-third innings while only surrendering a single run. Redshirt junior righty Carson Lambert and redshirt sophomore righty Kyle Wisch combined to only give up one additional run in relief. 
However, the Trojan offense couldn’t score enough runs to beat that total. Redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas laid down a perfect bunt single to knock in redshirt sophomore infielder Johnny Olmstead in the fifth inning, but that proved to be the only run the Trojans could muster. To make matters worse, they left 10 men on base throughout the course of the game. 
Huskies freshman outfielder AJ Guerrero hit a solo homer in the eighth inning to put his team on top for good. Washington walked away with a hard-fought 2-1 win. 
Game two on Saturday was the opposite story. The Trojan offense was on fire, and the team scored 11 runs. Redshirt junior catcher Tyler Lozano, filling the DH role for the day, hit a two-run homer, Olmstead had a three-run bomb of his own, and the team had 18 total hits. 
Despite a dominant performance at the plate for USC, the same cannot be said for its pitching staff. Washington crossed the plate 16 times, out slugging the Trojans on their way to a 16-11 victory. 
The Trojans finally showcased a balanced attack in Sunday’s game. Sophomore right-hander Charlie Hurley and Lambert both had solid outings on the mound, limiting the Husky damage on offense. Tyresse Turner hit a crucial three-run home run to give the Trojans a 4-3 lead in the fifth inning. 
The Trojans wouldn’t trail again until the final inning. USC had pushed the lead to 6-4 before Wisch was brought in to close it out. Instead, he surrendered four runs, including yet another go ahead homer from the Huskies’ Guerrero. Washington was suddenly on top 8-6. 
The Trojans had no answer in their final opportunity to get a win in the bottom of the inning, and Washington prevailed 8-6, sweeping the series.
“[A loss] certainly affects you emotionally quite a bit differently knowing you’re three outs away from a possible win. But they all sting. None of them feel good,” Gill said. 
Despite the results, Gill saw the Trojans’ effort in the series as a silver lining. 
“I felt like they competed their tails off and it just didn’t go our way,” Gill said.  
The Sunday win was the Huskies’ ninth in their past 11 games. They are riding an end of season turnaround straight toward the inaugural Pac-12 tournament. 
USC, on the other hand, finds itself on the brink of elimination from the tournament after the crushing sweep.
But, they still have one final week of the season to make something happen. 
The Trojans will travel to Santa Barbara for their final non-conference matchup Tuesday night at 5:30 p.m., before heading to Stanford for their final Pac-12 series on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. 
“The goals are the same, we’re going to go out there and play as hard as we can and try to win the game, it hasn’t changed the whole year,” Gill said.

No. 1 beach volleyball won its second-straight NCAA Championship title earlier this month, defeating No. 4 Florida State 3-1 in the Championship Dual. The Trojans’ national title clinch marks their fifth in program history. 
USC finished the season with a 37-1 record, starting and ending the 2022 season sitting atop the NCAA rankings.
“This was such a special team, and I told a lot of people that I think this was the best collegiate team that has been assembled in this short time that beach volleyball has been an NCAA sport,” USC Head Coach Dain Blanton said. 
USC kicked off their title hunt with a 3-0 sweep over Tennessee Martin in the first round of the tournament, marking the team’s 32nd straight dual victory and second-longest streak in program history. USC secured a sweep over Florida Atlantic in the quarterfinal stage. 
USC triumphed 3-1 over Florida State in the Winner’s Bracket Semi Final. After sophomore Delaynie Maple and graduate student Julia Scoles scored the first point of the dual. Florida State evened up the score when sophomore Megan Kraft and graduate student Sammy Slater suffered their only loss of the season. Senior Tina Graudina and graduate student Hailey Harward scored the clinching point at top court and the Trojans moved on. 
In their third sweep of the tournament, the Trojans defeated cross-town rivals No. 2 UCLA in the Winner’s Bracket Final to secure the final spot at the NCAA Championship. USC’s victory over UCLA added to their 21-14 all-time record against the Bruins. 
“I thought that the players played maybe one of their best matches of the year and so I was a little concerned [on] can we play to that level the next day during the finals,” Blanton said. “To no surprise, the players were able to do so.” 
Florida State met USC in the championship match after climbing the elimination bracket. For the second time in the tournament, USC defeated Florida State 3-1. 
 Despite Florida State’s effort to equalize and even the score at court two, the Trojans marched back with victories spearheaded by Graudina and Harward to recapture the lead. Maple and Scoles clinched the final point to propel the Trojans to their second-straight national title. 
“I think our team this year was just all super bought into this team,” said Maple in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Everyone went into games just excited to be there and we had a really close team [this year].” 
The Trojans lost the opening match to the Battle For L.A. Invitational at the hands of UCLA in March before embarking on a 36-win streak culminating in the Championship Dual against Florida State. 
“We brought it all together, once we lost that first early round match in the season we just changed our attitude and realized this is going to take us playing with a sense of urgency every single time that we step on that court,” Blanton said. “And that’s exactly what we were able to do.”
Graudina and Harward’s efforts throughout the season and 31-1 overall record earned the pair the AVCA National Pair of the Year award. 
“It was a complete team effort and so fun to watch every single court, I love the way the pairs came together,” Blanton said.

I’m back. 
Those are the words Michael Jordan released in a fax when he returned to basketball in 1995. And those are the words I release today. 
I am back. 
OK, back from what exactly you may ask? I was gone for basically a month. Jordan was gone for two years. The sports section didn’t even get a chance to move on from my columns and we’re back like we never left. 
This short break gave me enough time to gather my thoughts on what has become of the Los Angeles Lakers. Look, I get it — it’s the middle of the NBA Playoffs, and no one cares about the Lakers anymore. The Phoenix Suns just got whooped in Game 7 on Sunday, and I could spend time on that.
But, I, Anthony Gharib, the author of “Anthony on LA,” feel passionate about the debacle that has become of the Lakers. Therefore, this is what we will be discussing today since it, again, is I who writes this column. 
The Lakers finished the season with a 33-49 record, one game outside of the NBA Play-in Tournament. It was the Lakers’ lowest win total since the 2016-17 season when Jordan Clarkson led the team in scoring. There was no LeBron James, no Anthony Davis and, surely, no Russell Westbrook. 
The season was beyond disappointing in part because of the latter player. Westbrook’s acquisition was a Hollywood acquisition but never worked out on the big screen. Much of the blame must be put on owner Jeanie Buss and General Manager Rob Pelinka.
The deal wasn’t a Frank Vogel problem, the coach who was fired at the end of the 2022 season after winning a championship in 2020. 
The people around Buss are the problem.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Buss confirmed long rumors that former Lakers Magic Johnson, Phil Jackson and Kurt Rambis are providing input in decision- making. 
Magic and Rambis have had a plethora of roles with the Lakers. Of course, both were part of the showtime Lakers in the 1980s. Magic coached the Lakers for the final 16 games in the 1994 season. He then returned in 2017 as President of Basketball Operations — a quite successful tenure since he spearheaded the campaign for signing LeBron. However, he resigned in dramatic fashion at the end of the 2019 season before going on ESPN to expose the “backstabbing” in the Lakers organization. 
Rambis joined the Lakers as an assistant coach in the 1996 season until leaving in 2009, only to return for one season in 2013. He then moved away to join Jackson when the Zen Master became President of Basketball Operations of the New York Knicks in 2014. That’s when it got fun.
I won’t get into too much detail, but the Knicks never finished a season with more than 32 wins in the three seasons Jackson was there. He was dismissed in 2017. 
So, these three men are now giving input to owner Jeanie Buss. This would be a great idea — if the year was 2002. 
Rambis in particular has been toxic. In January, it was reported that not only is Rambis sitting in on coach’s meetings, but said all the coaches were at risk of being fired. Jackson is reportedly interested in trading LeBron and keeping Westbrook instead. 
Look, I really don’t need to say much about that. Anyone who thinks keeping Westbrook on this Lakers team will work is flat-out wrong. 
Magic isn’t a horrible person to relay information from, but Buss must not allow Rambis and Jackson to have as big a role as they do now. 
Both were part of the immense downfall of the Knicks that the team is still recovering from. Both have the credentials, maybe not Rambis, to make important decisions but simply cannot. Both are way past their prime as basketball savants. 
The game has evolved tremendously since the last time Jackson or Rambis were head coaches. 
Buss defended Rambis in the interview with the L.A. Times.
“I want to remind people, he’s been involved in the NBA for close to 40 years, that he has been a part of championship teams both as a player and assistant coach, he is someone I admire for his basketball knowledge,” Buss said.
Cool. But if you can’t adapt to the game’s evolution, Rambis’ credentials mean as much as mine. Buss must be smart about who she keeps around her. 
Anthony Gharib is a senior writing about all things Los Angeles sports. His column, “Anthony on LA,” typically ran every other Monday.

Summer break is coming up, and the months from May to August provide students this perfect opportunity to sober up. Without the social anxieties and exam stresses that gnaw at students during the entire semester, summer is the ideal time to take out any unnecessary substances and focus on themselves physically and mentally. Just as abstaining from alcohol is good for your health in the long run, doing the same for cannabis is too. It’s not too late to save your lungs and your brain.
Using cannabis is a favorite pastime activity for the Trojan student body. USC even has a cannabis-themed organization, Cannabis at USC, that seeks to educate and advocate for weed on campus.
The coronavirus pandemic considerably changed how young people interact with one another socially, and with isolation came a rise in recreational marijuana usage. According to one Statista study that measured cannabis consumption within three months of the Fall 2021 semester, 11.6% of all U.S. college students smoke weed daily or almost daily, and another 13.6% smoke weekly.
While on-campus cannabis usage has risen over the years and everyone of age has the right to make their own decisions, extensive cannabis usage can be detrimental to a person’s physical and mental health.
Research has shown that smoking marijuana impacts the parts of the brain related to memory, learning, concentration and problem-solving. Additionally, continuous usage of weed can lead to severe brain fog, memory loss and the inability to focus. The Massachusetts General Hospital found that young people who abstain from cannabis had better memory and ability to acquire new information.
Instead of baking yourself this summer, take this perfect opportunity to relax and pick up some new hobbies. Reading, for instance, reduces stress, improves focus and concentration, increases quality of sleep and has been shown to improve mental stimulation. Volunteering has also been shown to increase functional abilities and lower rates of depression. These activities are great to do and require that your mind is 100 percent there.
Exercising in the summer is another opportunity for college students to stay in shape or become more fit. Along with the perks of reducing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes, regular aerobic exercise also increases the size of the hippocampus — the area of the brain involved in learning and verbal memory. Further research has shown that psychological and physical exercise improves mood and reduces anxiety.
Cannabis use and the urge to work out, on the other hand, may not be a good mix. In another study, The Imperial College London found that long-term marijuana users produce less dopamine, the chemical in the brain linked to motivation. Thus, it is hard to exercise and maintain or improve one’s shape if one loses the urge to do so in the first place.
Most importantly, summer is the perfect space to improve one’s mental health after a long school year of studying. The CDC highlighted how marijuana consumption is correlated with “depression, social anxiety, thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts and suicide.” Substance usage has a huge effect on your mental health. Mental health impacts all aspects of life, so whether that is creating a sense of inner peace, thinking more coherently, improving relationships or increasing self-esteem, mental health must be prioritized and cannabis should not be a component in doing so.
There are so many different things to do during the summer. Abstaining from cannabis is just one opportunity that Trojan students can take advantage of, even if the task may be difficult. Breaking the habit is an achievement that will be better than any high.
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Cannabis at USC’s name as Cannaclub. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

As students left dorm rooms Wednesday and seniors became alumni Friday, the University and USC Student Health turned their focus to ensuring campus facilities are clean and safe for summer use. Cleaning procedures for on-campus spaces, including classrooms and USC Housing facilities, will emphasize environmental control of coronavirus infections. The University has also reprioritized improving air quality over surface cleaning, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said during a briefing with the Daily Trojan Thursday. 
Among other summer programs and camps, the University Park Campus will host a four-week for-credit program for high school students from June 19 to July 16. Student Health will monitor the cleaning of facilities to be used for summer programming.
Van Orman explained that the coronavirus can be transmitted by surfaces, a process formally called fomite-mediated transmission, but this is not the most common way infection occurs. It’s far more challenging, she said, to tackle aerosol transmission. 
“The most important thing is to focus on it from an environmental control standpoint rather than surfaces,” Van Orman said. “So, routine cleaning of surfaces will continue, but, more importantly, we will continue these heightened efforts around maintaining our indoor air quality.”
Van Orman said that the facilities team has upgraded air filters on campus and increased the frequency of their replacement. The “heightened air quality measures” will be implemented throughout the summer and for the foreseeable future, she said. 
Student Health observed rising coronavirus cases on campus over the past several weeks, but the infection rate — 8% for students and 3% among staff — is lower than during the winter, when positivity rates climbed to 14.79% among students and 12.48% among staff amid the peak of the Omicron variant surge in January. Van Orman said the University will continue to observe Los Angeles County coronavirus restrictions to determine the necessity of additional mitigation measures in August, when students are set to return for the fall 2022 semester. 
“For USC, how we make decisions in terms of policy is both based on the evolving research and science … but we also balance that with what our local public health is both recommending and requiring,” Van Orman said. “So we’re always going to do what public health requires.”
As people prepare to travel home, it’s most important that they make sure not to carry and spread the coronavirus with them to their destinations, Van Orman said. Regardless of whether they’re having symptoms, Student Health highly recommends that individuals monitor themselves and get tested accordingly. Testing is no longer available on Saturdays but will resume with normal operating hours — 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday and 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Friday — throughout the summer.
Though the federal mask mandate was no longer enforced in airports nationwide starting May 3, Van Orman said the masking requirement was dropped based on a legal consideration, ignoring public health concerns. Travel hubs — such as airports, train stations and subways — are extremely high-risk environments, she said, and “everyone should be wearing a high-quality mask while they’re in those areas, whether it’s required or not.”
Student Health recommends the use of N95 or KN95 masks, which are available to all faculty, staff and students at no cost at the USC Bookstores.

Resident physicians and fellows represented by the Committee of Interns and Residents/Service Employees International Union at LAC+USC Medical Center, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Martin Luther King, Jr. Outpatient Center began voting on the authorization of an unfair labor practice strike Monday. The move follows months of bargaining on a new contract, during which Los Angeles County has not met the union’s proposals and has repeatedly canceled bargaining sessions, according to a May 11 press release from the union. 
If the vote passes, the CIR/SEIU bargaining team will be authorized to decide to strike should the union be left unsatisfied with L.A. County’s bargaining practices and offers. An affirmative vote will not automatically push all member-doctors into a strike. 
“We are getting to the point of authorizing this vote that, hopefully, [L.A. County] will realize that we’re not going to take this lack of proposals and this bad faith bargaining and just roll over,” said Dr. Adam Freeman, a third-year resident pediatric physician at LAC+USC and one of CIR/SEIU’s bargaining team members. “We are going to fight for what we believe is right for us.”
After two weeks of voting, if the physicians’ ability to strike is authorized, the union will “seriously consider” the possibility of a strike, Freeman said. 
CIR/SEIU member contracts are renegotiated every three years with revised salary raises and benefits. The latest contract expired last fall, though negotiations for a new agreement were postponed to the spring due to the state of the coronavirus pandemic at the time, so the existing contract rolled over. 
“[L.A. County] comes back just refusing, saying ‘no’ to some of the proposals or not even coming to the meetings or coming unprepared to meetings, despite their assurances in the fall that they would come and it would be a quick, efficient process,” Freeman said. 
The union’s proposals include a salary floor increase of 10% amid rising costs of living in L.A. — area prices have risen 7.9% compared to April of last year, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Seeing as the housing bonus awarded to the three hospitals’ residents is “very low compared to other hospitals,” Freeman said, the union has also proposed an increase in the amount allotted to residents as a housing stipend paid additionally to the base salary. 
“We love working at the hospital and working with our patients, but at a certain point, we do need to be able to live in California,” Freeman said. “This is kind of a last resort, but it’s not something that we’re doing lightly.”
The union’s requests are not only economic, Freeman said. The CIR/SEIU team has also promoted a diversity proposal that would build on diversity training to help physicians better care for patients who are part of underserved groups, as well as a proposal regarding education benefits. 
The L.A. County Department of Health Services reaffirmed in a statement to the Daily Trojan Monday that labor negotiations are ongoing at the L.A. County Chief Executive Office. 
“Our health services could not be possible without our workforce members who deliver best-in-class care,” the statement read. “We want to thank our workforce members for their heroic efforts throughout the pandemic and as we move towards a better normal.”
If members move to authorize and later initiate the strike, the residents and fellows would become the first in their union to do so in 32 years. 
The strike authorization voting will continue until May 31.

As required viewing for this column, Greta Gerwig’s 2019 adaptation of “Little Women” adds the nuances of what was previously a simple footnote in the text regarding the less than spectacular ending of the penultimate chapter, titled “Under the Umbrella.”
Just in case you didn’t get the memo before picking up today’s paper, let me explain. Our beautiful heroine, Josephine March — or Jo — goes all 200-something pages of the novel talking about how she would not be fit for marriage. In fact, she desires to be alone and independent, but ends up falling for a 40-year-old German professor whom she ends up kissing, you guessed it, under the umbrella. 
At the end of the original novel, Jo goes against the character growth and persona that author Louisa May Alcott took so long to write out and ends up marrying the professor, Friedrich Bhaer, someone Jo regarded as a wise friend and not a lover until the very end of the novel. That ending begs a question: Why?
Well, it wasn’t Alcott’s choice. Like many other women in literature, especially at the time Alcott originally wrote “Little Women,” in order to be published, the female heroines of novels had to end up either married or well, dead. 
Take “The Awakening” by Kate Chopin. The main character, Edna, tries to leave her typical role as a wife and mother to pursue her interests after discovering her passion for independence. However, unable to truly have independence, Edna is overcome by grief and drowns herself. 
Or maybe you’ve heard this “happier” ending of “Jane Eyre,” a strong-willed youth who gets dulled down to a supporting character in her own life. This happens the second she falls for an older man, Rochester, and follows him with his plot to rid himself of his former wife. 
You might be thinking, are you comparing fate or death to marriage? Well, yeah, because either fate is not what these women were destined to do. Spinsters were not rare in real life, but in books, these characters were often in the background, certainly not the beloved main character.
Instead, we see these women betray their dreams and fall for older men, which reinforces the idea that the only match for smart young women are older men. It’s not necessarily pedophilia since most of these characters are at least 19, but it does give me the ick when I read about star-crossed romances between people whose age gap is undeniably noticeable. This is not to shame age gaps, but to put a spotlight on a common trend in literature to use the “older man” trope to marry off women who would be better off alone.
The integrity of these characters were sacrificed in the name of being published, which may be a better outcome than not being published at all and having us live in a world without the million “Little Women” remakes, but it does call into question how these novels have affected generations of women who see themselves in these independent, out of the ordinary heroines, then feel a disconnect in the ending when they are married off. 
We can’t obviously go back in time and force artists like Brontë and Alcott to revise their endings — or, in Alcott’s case, stick to the original ending — but what we can do is take after Gerwig’s approach to these stories and revise such horrid fates to be more fitting for the book lovers for which these heroines are meant to be. 
So go on, revise these endings fellow writers or, for those who prefer other mediums, reimagine these endings as you see fit, because these heroines belong to us, not older men. 
With conviction, 
Myriam

Alumni Park came alive and bustled with excitement May 13 for the Class of 2022’s Commencement ceremony. Graduating students gathered to celebrate their accomplishments and send off their USC careers with a flourish, sitting among peers, faculty members and proud family members and friends. 
USC’s 139th Commencement ceremony, along with the individual schools’ satellite ceremonies, was live streamed via 6Connex, an online platform for virtual events. The Trojan Marching Band, conducted by director Jacob Vogel, performed at the event, playing the fanfare, processional and recessional, filling the park with school spirit.
Raivyn Hearne, a U.S. army veteran and graduate majoring in popular music performance, sang the American national anthem, which was followed by the Invocation speech given by Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni. During the Invocation, all attendees were encouraged to pay respect and acknowledge the native land of the Tongva people and other Indigenious communities the University is situated on. 
Soni then talked about the birth of the cosmos and how the elements that build up human life came from exploded stars. We are all celestial beings, he said, and possess creative power from the universe.
“May you recognize once again that you are not isolated beings but deeply connected in miracle and in mystery to this universe, to this University and to each other, and may we all say together, amen,” Soni said to round off his address. 
President Carol Folt gave a President’s welcome speech to congratulate the Class of 2022, during which she spoke about the unique circumstances the coronavirus pandemic brought about, acknowledging the losses students might have experienced over the course of the pandemic, and mentioned the various ways Trojans pitched in to help in a time of need. She also discussed sustainability and environmental responsibility, and offered advice to the graduates.
“Your USC education and the wonderful relationships you have formed here are very precious, and they will serve you brilliantly,” Folt said. “You’re not afraid of facing society’s challenges. I have seen you embrace them with confidence and with optimism and your faculty, your staff, your family, your friends — they all know you. They know that you have the tools. They know that you have the passion. You have the ability and the commitment to dive right in and to make a difference.”
Adam Karelin delivered the valedictory speech, in which he thanked his classmates, his mentors and professors, his mom, his grandparents and his partner. Karelin then shared a poem that addressed the physical and emotional toll of Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine, and the glimmer of hope at the end of the destruction. Karelin said he knew he wanted to speak about the war in his speech, but as he wrote, he saw he was writing a poem, so he ran with it.
“He didn’t know why the dark blue sky had bled from yellow into red, but he knew winter must always yield to spring sunflowers in the field,” Karelin said, reciting the final words of the composition. “Thank you, and may we all find the strength to face evil with light.”
During her commencement address, Allyson Felix, an alumna and five-time Olympian, spoke about her career and lessons she’s learned from her experiences, hoping they would resonate with the graduating class. Now retired, Felix is the most decorated track athlete in the U.S., holding 11 Olympic medals. Felix addressed and called for action on causes important to her, such as closing the gender pay gap and raising awareness about maternal health. In her speech, she described the experience she had with Nike while pregnant, when the company offered her a 70% pay cut from her previous contract, and how she used her voice and was able to convince Nike to change its maternity policy. 
“Remember, your voice has power, and you have to use your voice, even if it shakes,” Felix said. “There are times when you’ll ask for change and there are times when you’ll create it. Your life has purpose, so it’s important to live a life of purpose. And I cannot wait to see the impact that you’ll all have on this world.”
Felix was presented the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters by the University. 
Karan Rami, a graduate who majored in business administration, said he found the speakers to be “funny and personable,” and their speeches relatable to his experience and his future. For Rami, Commencement was a day during which he reminisced on memories of his college days and even met a few people while standing in line to walk across the lectern. 
“It feels great [to have graduated], but also it’s bittersweet. I mean, I love USC,” Rami said. “Now it feels like I don’t have a reason to come back.”
Mahima Varanasi, who graduated with a degree in industrial and systems engineering, said the address from Felix, who Varanasi called a “total badass,” was her favorite part of the ceremony. Standing among her friends and classmates, all donning caps, gowns and sashes, Varanasi said the reality of the fact that she’s graduating truly hit her.
“Commencement was a lot of pomp and circumstance,” Varanasi said. “After the four years this class has had, I think a lot of pomp and circumstance is deserved. I think we all worked really hard and we didn’t know what was going to happen, but the hard work paid off and I think this is the only celebration worth all of our hard work.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the commencement date as May 11 instead of May 13. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
