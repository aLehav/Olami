The 2019 NFL Scouting Combine was perhaps one of the most memorable in recent history, with incredible feats of athleticism from this year’s NFL hopefuls. Among the impressive prospects in this year’s edition of the “Underwear Olympics” were five former Trojans, most of whom impressed on the big day. Though their performances might not have made national headlines like those of D.K. Metcalf or Montez Sweat, almost all of the former USC standouts’ showings likely boosted their draft stock.
Offensive lineman Chuma Edoga measured in at 6-foot-3 and 308 pounds, along with 34 6/8-inch arms — ideal for a NFL offensive tackle. Concerns about his upper body strength might remain after putting up only 21 reps of 225 pounds in the bench press, but he performed well enough to show his athleticism, looking fluid in drills and running a 5.19-second 40-yard dash — in the top half of the Combine’s offensive linemen.
Linebacker Porter Gustin may not have put on the athletic freak show some expected from him, but he turned in a good workout on Sunday. Measuring in at 6-foot-4 and a muscular 255 pounds, Gustin fits the frame for a modern edge rusher. A workout warrior, Gustin put up 31 reps on the bench press, tied for most by any linebacker this year and most by a Trojan since Nick Perry’s 35 back in 2012. 
Gustin’s on-field work was impressive as well, as he posted good marks with a 35.5 in the vertical and 10-7 in the broad. His 40-yard dash time was solid, if underwhelming, at 4.69 seconds. There’s a possibility that the injuries that forced him to miss the end of the season are still lingering, but he performed well enough to boost his stock nonetheless. Knowing him, it’s also not too much of a stretch to assume that he impressed scouts in the interview portion of the event as well.
Fellow linebacker Cameron Smith did perhaps the most of any Trojan to shoot up draft boards with his work in Indianapolis last weekend. The widely cited concerns around Smith revolved mostly around his perceived lack of the athleticism necessary for the pros. Though he did weigh in about 7 or 8 pounds less than he would have liked at 238, he alleviated those concerns with impressive athletic testing. 
His 4.69-second 40-yard dash, though unspectacular, was enough to prove that he has the necessary speed to run at the pro level, and his 4.23-second 20-yard shuttle was among the top 10 performers at his position. It was in the jump events that Smith shone the brightest, showcasing elite explosiveness that few would have expected from him. Smith jumped a 39-inch vertical — third among all linebackers behind only first round locks Devin Bush and Devin White. Smith also posted a tremendous broad jump of 12-3, good enough to finish in the top five at his position.
Defensive back Iman Marshall measured in at 6-foot-1 and 207 pounds — a good size for a cornerback — although his 30-inch arms might be a concern for some teams at the position. Perhaps the biggest question surrounding Marshall on his way to the combine was whether or not he’d show the necessary long speed to play corner in the NFL, a question he put to rest by running a time of 4.53 seconds in the 40-yard dash. 
Marshall did not participate in any of the other field tests, yet he was among the best performers in the drill portion of the day, showcasing fluid movement abilities and excellent ball skills. It wouldn’t be surprising to see a team look at him as either a safety or a cornerback at the NFL level.
Safety Marvell Tell, despite sitting out of the 40-yard dash due to a nagging ankle issue, may have had one of the most impressive workouts of anyone at this year’s combine. He showed above average size for a safety at 6-foot-2, 198 pounds, and his 33-inch arms  are a huge asset, a trait NFL teams will not overlook. He placed in the top three among all defensive backs in the four on-field events he participated in and no worse than second in any of them among the safeties. He posted ridiculous marks in both jumps, with a 42 in the vertical and an 11-4 in the broad; both top three among all defensive backs. 
Tell’s agility marks were similarly exceptional, with a 6.63-second mark in the three-cone drill and 4.01 in the 20-yard shuttle, both good enough for first among all safeties and second among all defensive backs. Teams will have to wait until USC’s pro day for an answer on his 40 time, but the athletic profile he put on today will undoubtedly help his case. It might even be argued that a team could try to mold him into a cornerback at the next level — he showed all the physical traits to do so.

In early January, a photo of Gov. Ralph Northam wearing a bright smile and blackface surfaced on the internet. In a bizarre series of revelations, Northam issued an apology, only to later say that although he was not the man pictured in the photo, he’d worn blackface that same year at a dance contest — which he won. Democratic leaders have called for Northam’s resignation, but he has refused to step down, and it’s important to consider whether or not he should have to. 
There is a variety of factors to consider when public figures are brought to the court of public opinion. For one, the severity of the offense should determine if an offender must step down. Though it’s odd and subjective to compare one form of indiscretion to another, Northam donning blackface is certainly less problematic than, say, committing a sexual assault. We also ought to consider that while Northam’s act was ignorant and committed in poor taste, his intent was not necessarily malicious. Blackface is historically rooted in minstrel shows, which were designed to lampoon black people for being lazy, dim-witted and uneducated. Northam wearing makeup for a Michael Jackson impression was simply in a different spirit than the historical form of blackface we consider taboo.  
A more compelling factor in Northam’s case is the age of his transgression. A full 35 years have passed since the photo was taken — if there is such a thing as a statute of limitations on political incorrectness, then surely it has passed. Northam wasn’t pictured committing any similar offenses in the years since he wore blackface, so it’s entirely plausible that the claim in his apology rings true, that “this behavior is not in keeping with who I am today.”
Still, some would argue that the time elapsed since his mistake shouldn’t matter. He is a representative of his state, and one aspect of this function is to uphold a proper reputation. This argument falls in line with a general desire for our politicians to be as well-behaved and unassailable as possible. It’s not unreasonable to hold one’s representative to a higher standard of behavior, but there must also be a certain level of tolerance for mistakes, even for conduct as insupportable as Northam’s. If we condemn people for moral missteps in their distant past, we deny ourselves the human capacity to grow and mature, especially with these changing times. Northam would likely never consider repeating his offense today, and his behavior 35 years ago does not reflect his current bearings. At this point, forcing Northam’s resignation would be a belated punishment — not directed at the person who committed a trespass, but at one who has by all accounts bettered his behavior since.
However, the argument that we should show leniency for past indiscretions walks a fine line. The same reasoning I’ve applied to Northam may very well be applied to someone like Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was recently brought to a Congressional hearing for sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. Both of these situations involve a political figure being brought under scrutiny for a past indiscretion, and both men are separated from their violations by nearly the same amount of time. 
Despite these similarities, there are some key distinctions between the two men’s cases that determine how they should be treated. For one, Kavanaugh’s misconduct was not limited to a single incident, as appears to be the case with Northam. Three women have come forward with accusations against Kavanaugh, so the “one-time mistake” argument can hardly be applied equally to both men. And while it is possible that both have changed since their respective offenses, the nature of Kavanaugh’s grievance is far more serious than Northam’s. To condemn one while forgiving the other would be hypocritical.  
With cases such as Northam’s, it can be tough to tell the difference between poor judgement and racial prejudice. It’s even more complex deciding whether to offer the benefit of the doubt, or to call for a termination of the offender’s career. For now, it may help for us to base our decision on actions instead of words. Since his apology, Northam has made promises to spend the rest of his term addressing racial inequality within Virginia and to examine his own racial privilege. Whether this is enough to mend his relationship with his constituents is yet to be seen, but it’s important that the governor be given a chance to prove that he has changed for the better.

In January, USC unveiled its “wellness-to-go” machine in the lobby of King Hall next to the Starbucks at Café 84. The machine is stocked with over-the-counter pharmacy products, including emergency contraception pills, pregnancy tests, painkillers and thermometers. This vending machine, first proposed by the Undergraduate Student Government last year, helps students obtain accessible health products. Since it is open 24 hours a day and located on campus, the machine helps students access over-the-counter medications outside the confines of pharmacy hours. While the installation is a step forward in establishing greater accessibility to health and wellness products, the machine lacks the privacy and widespread presence necessary to make a significant change. 
Though the FDA lowered the age requirement for purchasing the morning-after pill without a prescription to 15 years old in 2013, students still face barriers to accessing these pills on campus. The limited hours at Engemann Student Health Center on the weekends and the frequent obstacles in retail pharmacies off-campus curtail product accessibility in pharmacies. To combat this issue, this vending machine launched through a partnership between USC Student Health and USC Pharmacy to provide students with wellness and health products in a convenient and quick manner. The machine also offers emergency contraception medication at a lower price than retail pharmacies, which typically charge $40 to $52 per pill.
While cold treatments are less likely to elicit embarrassment or stress when purchased in public, students purchasing more sensitive products like pregnancy tests and emergency contraceptives may want more privacy, which USC’s “wellness-to-go” machine does not offer. The machine is intended to increase availability and decrease the stress and embarrassment students may experience when visiting health centers or drug stores. But due to its public location across from Webb Tower and in front of an oft-crowded Starbucks, it may not be as effective as anticipated. Students using the machine are bound to encounter multiple people who can view exactly which products they are buying. The public nature of the purchase disincentivizes many students who simply want privacy when using the machine. 
Protecting student privacy can be improved by looking into to practices at other universities. At Stanford University, some wellness vending machines are installed in gender-neutral bathrooms. UC Berkeley’s vending machines are located in their recreational facilities, providing greater privacy in a convenient location. At both of these universities, student government officers reported positive responses, and students are able to access the machines out of sight from their peers without drawing attention to themselves. Additionally, this privacy does not risk convenience. If USC followed suit, it could greatly reduce the privacy concerns created by the “wellness-to-go” machine’s highly visible location. 
USC can improve this program by installing more machines across campus, particularly near student housing, such as at McCarthy Quad, USC Village and Parkside. In time sensitive situations, machines must be readily available. Whether students are suffering from the flu or looking to quickly buy contraceptives, convenience is critical.
The “wellness-to-go” machine provides critical health care access to students, but USC must improve their impact and  ease of use. Access to health and wellness products is crucial for students.

Long gone are the days when wearing an Abercrombie shirt was the epitome of trendy fashion (well, USC Village may want you to think otherwise). If only it was still that simple. Now, trends have turned flashier, fancier and — you guessed it — pricier.
Namely, popular “haul” videos — where beauty  gurus on YouTube reveal what they’ve purchased on a given shopping trip, whether it’s clothes, groceries or home décor — are nothing new, but the content and price points of these hauls have increased dramatically since the videos first started popping up online.
In my youthful YouTube fandom of years past, most beauty influencers kept their shopping videos relatively moderate, routinely cycling between stores like H&M, Forever 21, American Eagle and the like. Now, hauls exist on polar ends: Either influencers are spending hundreds or thousands on cheap clothes from brands like Zaful or Wish to “prove” those items are worth it, or they’re dropping major coin on luxury brands for no apparent reason. 
Either way, the hyper-materialistic nature of the beauty influencer community promotes unsustainable shopping habits and unrealistic consumer behaviors to the average viewer, especially since most of these influencers’ key demographics are young and impressionable teens.
Focusing on the latter end of the spectrum, no designer brand has seen more of the spotlight lately than Gucci. A quick YouTube search for “Gucci Haul” will load pages upon pages of videos with titles like Tana Mongeau’s vlog “$5,000 GUCCI HAUL… uh oh,” Nicolette Gray’s (a.k.a. the “Beverly Hills Brat”) “$35,000 LUXURY HAUL” and Jeffree Star’s “GUCCI HAUL.” Each of these videos has over 2 million views.
The trend of leveraging luxury for views extends beyond the beauty community too. Notably, controversial 17-year-old YouTuber Emma Chamberlain has faced backlash for how her lifestyle habits have changed as her following grew. When Chamberlain first started in 2017, she was known for making fun of YouTubers who latched onto materialistic trends, demonstrated in her “$450 GUCCI T-SHIRT” parody video (over 3 million views) where she poorly painted the Gucci logo onto a basic white shirt. 
A little less than a year later, in her “TURNING ME INTO AN LA GIRL” video (17 million views), Chamberlain is seen taking a trip to the Gucci store and buying an actual Gucci belt. The difference between her and a classic beauty YouTuber, however, is that she approaches trend-following in an overtly sarcastic fashion. Her tone mocks the idea of spending so much money to be “cool” on the internet, an idea which largely stems from L.A. culture.
Last April, research analysts at Piper Jaffray found that Gucci was No. 10 among teens’ favorite apparel brands. Additionally, the brand’s comparable sales grew 48.7 percent in the first quarter of 2018 alone, according to Business Insider. 
This means that teens — who are constantly setting the standard for future trends — are buying into the notion that investing in designer brands like Gucci should be a common spending habit. And it shows: Nearly every day, I see someone whether in real life or on Instagram, wearing the classic Double G buckle Gucci belt, Gucci slides or an imitated Gucci design on some piece of apparel (I myself am guilty of having an imitation sweatshirt, I’ll admit). 
Don’t get me wrong, the belt makes a statement and looks great with many outfits. But I’ve had multiple conversations with friends who’ve all said they want to buy one (heck, I’d love to have one), and when I ask why, they just shrug. 
Often, there’s no thought-provoking reason we choose to buy into ridiculous internet trends. We just do.
It doesn’t stop at Gucci or any other ridiculous consumeristic habits promoted by influencers for that matter. Internet culture can no longer be satisfied by watching someone who’s just like you, buying another pair of American Eagle jeans or vlogging while on their weekly trip to Trader Joe’s. Now, it’s about buying into someone who exemplifies an idealized version of life, which often involves content that glorifies living in extremes. Spending thousands on designer brands. Experiencing a $10,000 plane seat. Buying a mansion at 19. 
A large reason I stepped back from YouTube was that my YouTube consumption and spending habits were becoming directly connected. The more hauls, makeup videos, travel vlogs and challenges I watched, the more I felt the need to buy things to live up to an influencer’s idealistic existence. The less I watched, the more I was able to discern what activities actually aligned with my lifestyle and perception of self.
Social media can convince you that designer brands are the new standard of living. But it’s not a way of being — it’s a way of buying. 
So go ahead, invest in what makes you feel happiest and most like yourself in whatever form that takes, but remember that owning a Gucci belt is, in fact, not a personality trait.

In May 2002, the Cannes Film Festival premiered “Irreversible” to mixed responses from the audience. Some people believed the movie had strong artistic merit, as it received a five-minute standing ovation. However, many deemed it unwatchable because it caused 250 people to walk out of the screening — some in need of medical attention.
Ever since then, director Gaspar Noé has kept this controversial stigma alive with each successive movie. This is why the marketing for his newest film, which had a limited release Friday, was as follows: “You despised ‘I Stand Alone.’ You hated ‘Irreversible.’ You loathed ‘Enter the Void.’ You cursed ‘Love.’ Now try ‘Climax.’”
The film opens on a wintry night, as French dancers gather for the day’s rehearsal in an empty school building. After drinking LSD-laced sangria at a post-practice party, the group slowly descends into a waking, hallucinatory nightmare.
Knowing that the drug-centric nature of the film might cause audience members to suffer panic attacks, Noé starts the movie in a more casual tone with a series of interviews with the dancers. Old books and DVDs bleed into the sides of the screen while a TV placed in the center sequentially plays each interview. Not a single inch of empty space is visible. After this sequence and two expertly-coordinated, sensuous dances, Noé starts the slow but creeping descent into madness.
In “Enter the Void,” Noé demonstrated the effects of drugs through vibrant shapes and an epileptic atmosphere. However, in “Climax,” he displays the effects of LSD strictly through each dancer’s actions after unknowingly consuming the drug. As such, the performances naturally convey the anguish the group undergoes. The strong chemistry among all of them is palpable.
Except for a few rooms and a hallway, the setting confines the dancers to the main rehearsal space, allowing Noé to generate much discomfort since the dancers are forced to interact with one another as the drugs kick in. The film’s unpredictability stems from the fact that Noé only worked off of a one-page outline — the events and conversations are largely improvised.
While the movie makes the dancers feel secluded, Noé makes the entire trip feel grandiose through the camerawork. There are long takes that feel like they last more than 10 minutes. Many of these shots involve complicated elements like moving between different areas of the building or suddenly turning the camera upside down to capture the situation’s intensity. This impressive cinematography is consistent throughout the movie, and it’s the one element that keeps the viewer’s attention even before the dancers’ LSD trip.
What truly ensnares the audience is the techno-infused soundtrack. Varied and electrifying, it includes artists like Cerrone and Daft Punk’s Thomas Bangalter. Given the setting and concept, the music helps create tension for the viewers and reel them in, even during the more mundane parts of the film.
The film’s sound editing works best during the actual LSD trip.Screams of agony echo as the camera moves between different rooms, away from the source of the sound. Moments like these are why the movie deserves to be seen in theaters — the movie is most powerful when experienced with surround sound.
Of course, Noé has built up a reputation for unflinchingly showing disturbing content in his films, and “Climax” is no exception. The most terrifying moments are scattered throughout the long, nightmarish sequence. These instances, which will easily disgust the faint of heart, range from shocking imagery to horrific events that result from the choices of certain character.
In fact, the film’s only minor shortcoming is that it does not effectively create the high level of distress that Noé wanted the audience to feel toward the end. Based on the plot and direction, it appeared as if the emotional reaction of this anxiety-inducing trip was going to unfold like in “Irreversible,” if it here told chronologically: slowly building until it reaches one chaotic culmination.
The climactic point in the film is highly effective, showing that most of its behind-the-camera direction was wise. It’s just that Noé could have done more — like making the music louder or the camera more focused — to leave a stronger impact on the viewer.
Still, Noé has once again proven himself an incredibly provocative and intriguing director. While it isn’t impactful enough to be deemed a pure cinematic achievement, “Climax” is still undoubtedly an impressive, immersive and terrifying experience.

Panelists at the Price Women and Allies’ International Women’s Seminar discussed global issues women have continued to face domestically and abroad Monday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The panel featured Sara Brown, a postdoctoral fellow at the USC Shoah Foundation; Sangita Shresthova, director of research of the Civic Imagination Project@CivicPaths at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism; and Isabella Carr, assistant director of the Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics. PWA member Tanya Shah moderated the discussion.
The panel started off with each speaker introducing herself and telling stories about some of their trips and projects abroad. Shresthova said that when she was a dancer in India, her landlord scolded her when a male teacher drove her home from a performance during the day. The landlord told her that she caused problems by bringing men back to the house. Shresthova said her landlord made assumptions about her because she is half Nepalese.
“That moment kind of drove back home to me how the layers work in different ways, and there’s yet another layer to peel back around assumptions [of] women’s roles,” Shresthova said. “It also was a moment where I was like … I’m going to stand up [for myself] here.” 
Shresthova said that while she understands the importance of being culturally sensitive, she confronted her landlord and moved out that day because she didn’t want to support the landlord’s prejudiced beliefs, even if they were ingrained in his culture. 
The panelists also discussed the main differences they noticed between America and the various countries where they visited and worked. Brown said she realized on a trip to a refugee camp in Tanzania that she has acted with a large amount of privilege and agency compared to women in other parts of the world. 
She said it was difficult to teach ideas of gender equality and independence at a refugee camp where people must follow a strict schedule and rules to get food or leave the premises. 
“How do you go into a refugee camp where someone has to get a pass to even be able to leave the immediate vicinity without risk of being jailed … how do you go in and then talk to them about gender mainstreaming and empowerment and agency?” Brown said. 
Shresthova said that when volunteers and workers complete projects in developing countries, they must consider the local culture and speak with the people they are aiming to help. For one project in Nepal, she said they built water taps in villages so that women didn’t have to walk for hours to get water; however, the women were not happy. 
“When all the male experts left, and I was just chatting with them, they were like, ‘Actually, that time to walk was the time we had to hang out with each other and to speak,’” she said. “So something that would seem like a straightforward technological improvement to their lives was actually disrupting their female community.” 
Carr said that women in America, especially after  #MeToo, are more open to sharing stories of sexual abuse than women in countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina. She said many of the Bosnian women refused to talk about the forcible rapes they endured for years while in captivity.
“[They] were not comfortable, it felt like they weren’t allowed to speak of it, a lot of it because they work in a small community and everyone would know,” Carr said. “Shame was something that came out a lot.” 
Brown said traveling to various countries that oppress women means having to take certain precautions to avoid being sexualized and abused. She said that in Egypt because of negative stereotypes toward Western women, she was instructed to wear a wedding ring and dress conservatively. Otherwise, she was told she would be “inviting men to touch [her].” 
“At the time, I wanted to balk and say, ‘Well, I’ll do whatever I want,’ but at the same time, I was very mindful of the fact that the advice I was being given was advice from an informed source trying to protect me,” Brown said.  
Brown said she and her friends saw a woman at a market in Cairo wearing long shorts with her head uncovered being chased by men who were trying to grab her.
At the event, Sarah Fisher, a graduate student studying public administration, asked how to approach women’s issues differently in someone’s home country versus a country with different customs and cultures. 
Carr said it’s important to focus on solving local issues rather than criticizing international practices. 
“I think it is irresponsible to some degree to not be engaged with your local community and to be engaged with these issues just internationally,” Carr said. “Though I think that obviously you should and can be doing both, but it is a good reminder for me that it’s not always productive for me as a Western woman to go into these other [countries] and be like, ‘This government, how could they do this?’”

The Department of Public Safety notified students, faculty and staff Monday of a sexual battery incident on Trousdale Parkway that took place Saturday morning. 
According to the alert, a non-USC female was walking on Trousdale when a group of approximately nine juvenile, non-USC males approached her from behind. As the group rode past the victim, “one of the juveniles slapped her with an open hand on her right buttocks.”
DPS has yet to locate the suspects.
“The group of juveniles continued riding southbound on Trousdale until they were out of sight,” the memo read.
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said incidents where a victim is approached by a group of suspects usually happen more often in the neighborhood surrounding campus than on campus itself. 
“It’s a rare occurrence,” Carlisle said. “This was a group of juveniles, who appeared to be under 18 years of age on bicycles. And one of them took advantage of someone walking on campus and struck them on the backside, and they all rode away quite quickly.” 
Carlisle also said it was rare for a large group of individuals to commit this type of crime. In these incidents, the crime is usually committed by one individual in the area surrounding campus.
“It’s a difficult situation because we don’t know who the bicyclists were,” Carlisle said. “You can move quite quickly through our open campus during the day on bicycles. This does happen periodically, but not usually on campus …. It is usually just one individual, but in this case, it was a large group.” 
Carlisle said DPS is required to notify the campus community when incidents like this occur and encourages the USC community to remain aware. 
“It was a large group, and it is difficult to prevent because we are an open campus,” Carlisle said. “Just be aware of your surroundings. There is hard to do much more than that … We have had a couple of cases in the past where it was someone who was chronically doing it and most of the time we catch them because our officers have video surveillance.” 
To increase on-campus safety and address bike theft, DPS has redeployed various resources such as additional officers and increased camera surveillance, according to Carlisle. 
Carlisle said DPS will remain vigilant groups of non-USC individuals that ride throughout campus.
“Groups of young males riding on campus in groups is something that might cause us to detain them and ask what their purpose is,” Carlisle said. “While we encourage public access to our academic resources and libraries and theatres … groups of boys riding bikes might justifiably be a little more closely watched.”

Construction is underway to convert the Engemann Student Health Center’s previously unoccupied fifth floor into a new student mental health services floor. The initiative is led by Keck Medicine of USC’s psychiatry department and is expected to by completed by the end of 2019.
Currently, USC Student Health’s counseling and mental health services primarily focuses on providing short-term individual therapy and semester-long group therapy. For individual therapy, the center currently sees students who either need emergency crisis counseling or counseling for short-term issues, such as a death in their family or relationship troubles. These students are seen for six to eight sessions, then referred to off-campus services if they want to continue therapy. Students who wish to see a therapist for long-term concerns but aren’t in crisis can consult USC Student Health for an off-campus referral. 
The new services will include ongoing weekly and semi-monthly private appointments, according to Meg Aldrich, director of media relations for Keck Medicine of USC. 
Psychiatry department chair Steven Siegel said that after USC Student Health became part of Keck two years ago, he and other faculty saw a need for improved on-campus mental health services.
“There have historically been a large number of students who are referred out into the community to receive care that exceeds the capacity of what we can do inside Student Health,” Siegel said. 
Siegel said the psychiatry department proposed an overhaul of mental health services to Keck in 2017. Keck subsequently proposed the changes to the University. Aldrich said USC Student Health plans to hire 18 new medical providers for the fifth floor, including social workers, therapists and psychiatrists. 
In addition to increasing mental health services staff, Siegel said the fifth floor will be built and designed based on “what a psychiatrist would want,” from its floor plan to the sensitivity training that all staff members will receive. 
Tammy Capretta, Keck’s administrative chief integration and risk officer, was part of the design team for the new fifth floor, which will include 18 new consult rooms. Capretta said she wanted to prioritize students’ privacy and comfort in her designs for the new space, from the hallway lighting to the colors of paint on the wall. 
“[I wanted] the environment [to be] warm and welcoming,” Capretta said. “The way it’s designed, even the acoustics in this environment are highly developed so that it is a very private environment.” 
She said the new fifth floor will also include an electric fireplace, group therapy rooms and staff members that are assigned to assist students in the waiting area. Capretta stressed the significance of USC Student Health expanding its mental health services, since Engemann has not provided specialty services for USC students in the past. 
“These are going to be specialized mental health services that are available — not inpatient services … that can be offered over a longer-term basis that will be available on this fifth floor,” Capretta said. 
Although counseling and mental health services at Engemman see some students at the center, in the past, approximately 70 percent of students were referred off-campus. 
Maddie Kutler, a sophomore majoring in psychology and French, found an off-campus therapist through Engemann last fall, whom she visits every Friday. She said she was frustrated by her experience scheduling and receiving a consultation through USC Student Health.
The current process for students to receive an off-campus referral is to schedule a consultation appointment online (Kutler said the first one she could find was a month later) or in person at the health center answer a list of questions about why they are seeking treatment and then receive a list of options that will accept their insurance. 
“That whole process, I could have done on my own … You’d be able to find that information without them,” Kutler said.   
Siegel recognized the problems USC students have had finding accessible mental health care, and said student accessibility is his top priority for the new services.
“[We want to] make it here, make it easy [and] make it so you can go now, not in six weeks,” Siegel said.
