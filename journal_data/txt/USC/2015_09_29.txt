Austin Dunn, co-director of University Affairs for Undergraduate Student Government, announced the installation of three free air pumps for bicycles on campus last night at the USG Senate meeting in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
“Right now we are working in the location of where those are going to be,” Dunn said. “As of right now, our proposed locations are in front of EVK … one in the new Annenberg building, [and] we are going to put one in one of the two areas in the corners of campus.”
This initiative came in the wake of various bicycle and pedestrian-related problems faced on campus by students.
“We’ve had a lot of issues in the past with bikes as a whole,” Dunn said. “There’s anywhere from bike infrastructure to bike safety [issues].”
Dunn said that University Affairs is looking to reinforce bicycle lanes on campus, and that the administration’s greatest achievement so far this year is the implementation of new bicycle parking measures.
“As you can tell, there are no longer bikes allowed to be parked in front of Campus Center,” Dunn said. “They have installed a lot of new bike racks around campus, but a lot of them are not known to students, so we are [going] to make a video and a diagram that shows students all of the locations where they can park their bikes in order to avoid getting them stolen or whatever it may [happen].”
Dunn said that despite the bicycle-related issues, he has an optimistic view of the measures so far, as they provide more safety for students, better walking spaces, a more pleasing aesthetic and easier access for students with disabilities.
“It’s a really big issue on campus,” Dunn said. “We have received a lot of negative feedback from people not being allowed to park in front of the Campus Center, but overall it’s been a really good transition period for us.”
Dunn also mentioned that a “bike share” initiative has been introduced to a University Affairs committee, which could radically change on-campus transportation for students if carried out.
“[Bike sharing] was a program that was originally instituted at NYU,” Dunn said. “This serves in the same way as a car program at the airport, where you would take a car and return it [to] the same place.”
According to Dunn, the bike share stations would be spread out around campus in the “most popular places where students are living,” such as the Row and Adams Boulevard. Dunn noted some of the difficulties with the initiative.
“[This] would serve … in lieu of students having their own bikes, [prohibiting] bikes on campus as a whole,” Dunn said. “Being completely honest, I don’t see that as too feasible of a project as of right now. I don’t think that it is something the University is going to pursue, just something we explored very briefly.”
Dunn also wanted to publicize other bicycle resources available to students such as the bike shop that operates on Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard. But the area around that bicycle shop, Dunn said, also needs serious improvement.
“The walkway is very narrow and during high intervals of the day, there are so many bikes, and it’s very difficult and dangerous to cross,” Dunn said. “So we’re looking to expand the walkway.”
Dunn explained that the sidewalk is not owned by USC, but by the city. Dunn and other members of University Affairs were put in contact with an administrator who will connect with the city. They will then try to move forward with a plan to raise the level of the street to make it safer for bikes, and also in separate bicycle and walking lanes.
Overall, Dunn emphasized the importance of administrative support.
“We have framed an argument to really push hard for an administrator to oversee bikes. That’s probably our most important focus now,” Dunn said. “We need someone to report and discuss our bike issues with, otherwise it’s almost useless because we are just going back and forth between committees.”

John A. Pérez, the first openly gay Speaker of the California State Assembly, spoke at a panel discussion about LGBT issues and the upcoming election cycle Tuesday evening at the University Club. The event was organized by the USC Lambda LGBT Alumni Association.
Pérez joined a panel of four that included two USC faculty members — Rebecca Brown, the Rader Family Trustee Chair in Law at the Gould School of Law, and Larry Gross, professor of the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism — as well as USC alumnus, Brian Calle, ’05, opinion editor for the Orange County Register and Press-Enterprise and Melissa Gibbs, ’10, a strategy and communications consultant.
The panel was moderated by Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Dan Schnur. He began by addressing his personal connection to LGBT issues.
“I worked in partisan politics for many years, but some years ago switched my party registration to independent,” Schnur said. “I made that decision for a number of reasons, foremost among them the topic that has brought us here for our conversation tonight.”
Pérez also touched upon his experience with partisanship in the California State Assembly. He was elected in November of 2008, around the same time Proposition 8, a referendum banning same-sex marriage in California, passed.
“Five or so years before I got to office, it was decided that we could not celebrate LGBT pride on the floor of the state capital,” Pérez said.
In March of 2010, he brought the Gay Men’s Choir of Los Angeles to Sacramento to fill the floor and sing classic American tunes. Pérez and Schnur agreed that it was efforts to humanize the issue of LGBT rights, which made public opinion on marriage equality change so drastically in a few short years.
“We found that people involved themselves because of relationships with family members and close friends who were gay,” Pérez said. “That coupled with technology brought attention to the issue in a more expedited way.”
Pérez also explained that he believes marriage equality is only the starting point for LGBT rights. Employment and housing discrimination, he says, contribute to the larger problem of LGBT inequality.
“Yes, I can get married,” Pérez said. “But if my marriage is public, I can lose my job.”
The panel touched upon the idea of changing the conversation around LGBT issues.
“The issue is that we get so consumed with our own messaging,” Gibbs said. “We should be looking at the opponent’s side. That’s not easy to do. But it’s not easy for those people to come out in support for LGBT issues.”
Alumni in attendance appreciated the diversity of opinions and the variety of backgrounds represented on the panel.
“I particularly liked the fact they had panelists from all different areas. They had individuals who were working in the community,” Gould School of Law alumnus David Bohner said. “That to me brought all the different perspectives together.”
Panelists also discussed the likelihood that LGBT issues, such as marriage equality and employment discrimination, will show up on the political agenda for the 2016 election.
“I think it’s going to rear it’s ugly head in the primaries,” Calle said. “If we publicize people like Kim Davis, it’s going to become an issue.”
Many agreed that LGBT issues are now political issues that society is unwilling to ignore.
“They really touched upon the fact that LGBT is everywhere,” Thornton School of Music alumnus Ryan Mantione said. “It’s not just .01 percent of the population.”
Last year, the USC Lambda LGBT endowment awarded more than $60,000 in scholarship money for LGBT and ally students.
“Tonight’s program represents new ground for USC Lambda,” Director Todd Kimmelman said. “We have never hosted a panel discussion like this in our 23-year history.”

Lieutenant General Jeffrey Talley, the 32nd Chief of the United States Army Reserve, spoke to students Tuesday afternoon about how social entrepreneurship in engineering and business can help achieve and maintain global security and stability.
Talley, the commanding general of the United States Army Reserve Command, is also a businessman and engineer with over 33 years of experience. He earned his Ph.D. in civil and environmental engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and was CEO of Environmental Technology Solutions prior to being drafted back into the army’s private sector. Talley has been a faculty professor at Johns Hopkins University, Southern Methodist University and University of Notre Dame.
The lecture began with a conversation on alternative means of combatting threats such as pollution, lack of security and poverty — all direct results of globalization. Talley said that violence or the use of lethal force is usually the solution of choice, but empowering disadvantaged populations to help themselves would prove more efficient.
Rachel Rowzee, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, expressed her opinion on Talley’s preferred alternative solution to threats.
“Empowering people now benefits both parties. Teaching people to protect themselves for the future prevents further U.S. involvement and creates communities that are self-reliant,” Rowzee said.
Talley began with an analogy explaining how social entrepreneurship is the best method to achieve global sustainability.
“You’ve probably heard people say, ‘I don’t want to give you a fish. I want to teach you to fish,’” Talley said. “Well, if you want to have that sustainability, what you really want to do is help [people] create their own fishing company that could help sustain the village so they could be self-sufficient. That’s really what sustainability is all about. I would argue that it’s really social entrepreneurship that promotes global security.”
Carter Boisfontaine, a sophomore majoring in business administration, offered his own opinion on why social entrepreneurship efforts would prove successful in establishing global stability.
“Social entrepreneurship means striving to alleviate a pain point within a community,” Boisfontaine said. “Social entrepreneurship ventures can educate, protect or provide for any demographic. I believe social entrepreneurship is humanity’s natural instrument to improve aspects of daily life, including security. The notion is both inspiring and infectious — entrepreneurship empowers people to conquer adversity by example.”
Talley continued with an example of his experience as the first preventional engineer in the “Engineering the Peace” operation in Sadr City, Iraq. The mission consisted of projects meant to build security and stability in Iraq’s “center of gravity” through non-lethal efforts. Talley said that they aimed to offer essential services and infrastructure for the Iraqis, lessen the presence of violence and use capitalism to convince the Iraqi people that they need to invest in themselves and their country.
Talley constructed numerous projects to help stimulate the Iraqi economy.
“These projects are projects that are initiated and completed by the Iraqi start-up companies, and with my engineering and business background with a really good team, we were helping them write business plans — helping them technically execute [those plans] to serve the Iraqi people.”
He then described the transformation Sadr City underwent as a result of the social entrepreneurship efforts of him and his team.
“So [when] I came into Sadr City, you couldn’t walk down the street because of the debris, the rubble and the gunfire. When I left Sadr City, you couldn’t walk down the street because of all the commerce,” Talley said.
Talley explained that another objective was to persuade the Iraqi people to invest in Iraqi companies rather than the militia. Eventually, Iraqis started to come to the U.S. Army to self-report the location of IEDs — improvised explosive devices — and possible militia attacks.
Talley ended the conversation by reasserting that the United States should focus on measures that promote “preventing and shaping” rather than lethal operations, especially with the utilization of holistic engineering and an entrepreneur’s mindset.

Senior Jacob Morrison has taken on the challenge of researching the reasons behind the drought in California. Morrison is currently working on Rivers’ End: California’s Latest Water War, a documentary that focuses on the issues of water usage and shortage in the state of California. He is hoping to release the film in May 2016.
Morrison explained that the two largest contributors to the water shortage in California are lack of rainfall and misuse of water supply. The majority of California’s water supply comes from the San Joaquin River Delta connected to the San Francisco Bay. Water levels there have been low because of the lack of snowfall in the Sierra mountains. Many Californians are aware of the low precipitation rate, but Morrison was surprised to learn about the century-old water policies. He was inspired to create this documentary after speaking with several farmers and realizing the problem.
“A lot of the water policies in California predate the Gold Rush,” Morrison said. “In many ways you are looking at the result of a 19th century infrastructure in a 21st century world. We have a growing population as well as a growing agricultural production.”
The larger issue is the state’s management of the limited water that we do have, Morrison explained.
“About 80 percent of water usage is going to agriculture, and only about 20 percent is used by the cities,” he said.
Morrison gave a hypothetical scenario in which all residents of California did their part by conserving water in their household. This includes limited lawn watering and shorter showers. Because only 20 percent of water is used by cities, they would not be able to make a huge dent in the issue.
“It is very important that everyone does their part, but if you really want to make a change, you have to look at the big picture and focus on improving our water policy,” he said.
Morrison encourages everyone to continue to conserve water, but more importantly, he emphasizes the importance of being educated about California’s water policies. Morrison urges people to write letters to local leaders to urge them to take action.
“The drought may end or be eased by El Niño, but either way we are going to see a drought again,” Morrison said. “We have a growing population in the world. In order to make sure that we plan for that, we have to look at the way we use water and who uses water.”
In Rivers’ End: California’s Latest Water War, Morrison will propose possible solutions to the water management problem. He hopes the film will inspire others to engage with the issue.
“You have to know what is going on, then do something about it,” he said. “I would love if the film would inspire people to do that.”

Memory creation involves the translation of complex electrical signals across various regions of the hippocampus — a process that has now been successfully mimicked by a device USC researchers helped create.
Professor Ted Berger and Research Associate Professor Dong Song of the Viterbi School of Engineering have collaborated with researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center to develop a cutting-edge brain prosthesis that could help individuals struggling with memory loss.
The device, which involves the implantation of a set of electrodes in the brain, can bypass damaged hippocampal regions to keep providing a correct translation of signals to the next intact region. Its design relies on an algorithm created by Song and decades of Berger’s research, as well as more than a decade-long partnership with Sam Deadwyler and Robert Hampson of the Department of Physiology & Pharmacology at Wake Forest Baptist. The prosthesis was originally designed at USC and tested at Wake Forest Baptist, though both groups have now tested models.
Though the device can translate electrical signals for other hippocampal regions, there is still no way to “read” a memory based solely on the translation of signals.
“It’s like being able to translate from Spanish to French without being able to understand either language,” Berger told USC News.
Next, researchers aim to send translated signals far enough into the process to generate long-term memory. It is currently supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and could help previously injured soldiers now struggling with memory loss.
“Being able to predict neural signals with the USC model suggests that it can be used to design a device to support or replace the function of a damaged part of the brain,” Hampson told USC News.

Bye bye birdie · Junior Karen Chung won the individual title at the Annika Intercollegiate in Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday. The Women of Troy also captured a first place finish with a school-best 35-under. – Courtesy of Sports Information
The No. 2 women’s golf team opened its season at the Annika Intercollegiate in Orlando, Florida, with a 23-stroke victory. The team shot a school-best 36-under while junior Karen Chung took home the individual title, shooting 12-under.
The Women of Troy had four golfers in the top seven to win at 36-under 828. That was just five strokes shy of the NCAA record of 41-under.
“What an incredible record-breaking performance by our team,” head coach Andrea Gaston said. “It’s exciting to kick off our season this way. The Trojans were blessed with three incredible days, and I’m really proud of them.”
Chung just beat freshman teammate Robynn Ree, who took second at 10-under 206, to earn her third career collegiate title at 12-under 204, the second-lowest  54-hole total in USC history.
“Starting off the season winning by 23 strokes is pretty spectacular,” Chung said. “I can’t wait to go play in our next event.”
The Women of Troy will look to win their third consecutive Windy City Collegiate Classic on Oct. 5 and 6.

Something unheard of happened this weekend. Something we haven’t seen all year; in fact, something we haven’t seen since last December.
Cody Kessler threw an interception.
It was early in the first quarter. It turned out to be inconsequential in USC’s 42-14 win over Arizona State. But it’s still a noteworthy blemish on an otherwise flawless record for Kessler so far this season.
Kessler can’t win the Heisman anymore.
Joking. As fellow Daily Trojan columnist Regan Estes discussed yesterday, Kessler absolutely belongs in the discussion with the best players in the country. And he might even break the trend of recent USC quarterbacks and have a somewhat sustained NFL career. But I would say that regardless of USC’s performance the rest of the season, Kessler probably doesn’t have the athleticism to actually win the Heisman.
Kessler might be the most underrated quarterback in all of college football. But he also might be the most overrated as underrated too. Everyone from ESPN to Bleacher Report to this publication have used that title for him, but he finally started getting some of the preseason hype he deserved this year as a preseason All-American and a mentioned player on a lot of Heisman watch lists.
Last year, Kessler threw for 3,826 yards and 39 touchdowns while only racking up five interceptions. His completion percentage was 69.7 percent, and his quarterback rating was 167.1.
His QBR tied for third in all of Division I-A, trailing only Oregon’s Marcus Mariota at 181.7 and J.T. Barrett of Ohio State with 169.8. His completion percentage was best in the conference and third best in the nation — Grant Hedrick of Boise State led the country with 70.8.
His yardage was 11th best in the country and fourth best in the conference behind Mariota, Cal’s Jared Goff and Washington State’s Connor Halliday. His touchdown total was fourth best in the nation and second to Mariota’s 42 in the conference.
In short, Kessler statistically was maybe the second-best quarterback in the country. The only players with comparable passing numbers were from outside of Power Five conferences — like Western Kentucky’s Brandon Doughty.
Kessler was also the essence of reliablility last year. He never had bad games. He threw for fewer than 200 yards in just two games, and USC was 2-0 in those contests against Stanford and Arizona. He also never threw more than one interception in a game. Along with his remarkable reliability, he showed big play potential, with plenty of long balls over the top of the secondary for touchdowns.
Kessler’s first four games this year look very similar to his first four games last year. They include very solid numbers in three big blowouts, as well as a very solid performance in a losing effort. Last year, he had 317 yards and four TDs with a 75 percent completion percentage in a defensive meltdown against Boston College. In this year’s defensive meltdown against Stanford, he was three TDs and 272 yards with a 78.1 percent completion rate.
Last year, most of Kessler’s big numbers came from the worst defenses in the country, and there were notable drop-offs against tougher competition. He combined for about 18 touchdowns against Colorado, Washington State and Notre Dame but could only put together two TDs against Stanford, Arizona State, Arizona and UCLA. It’s too early to say if he will buck that trend this year. The only strong defense he’s really faced was maybe Stanford’s, and that loss was certainly not on him.
With Mariota now in the NFL, Kessler is probably the best quarterback in the conference. The sample size is still small, but Kessler is statistically on top of Pac-12. His 15 touchdowns, 1,297 yards and 201.2 QBR all lead the conference. His 73.0 percent completion percentage is just fractions below Washington State’s Luke Falk — Kessler’s is technically 72.95 percent to Falk’s 73.03, but we’ll round up. Cal’s Goff is a close second and UCLA’s Josh Rosen has shown flashes of elite talent, but Kessler is the only one to show his tremendous reliability over a long period of time.
The biggest knock on Kessler for me is that he is very much                 one-dimensional. Pocket passers aren’t necessarily worse than dual threat options, but having someone like a Mariota or a Brett Hundley who can pick up a couple first downs with his feet makes a huge difference over the course of a drive, game and season. Having a mobile quarterback totally changes the dynamic of an offense and puts so much more pressure on a defense. It’s why so many teams put their best athlete behind center, but almost no one would give that distinction to Kessler before guys like Su’a Cravens and Adoree’ Jackson.
It’s the only reason why I doubt Kessler’s Heisman chances. Since Matt Leinart won the Heisman in 2004, the last time a USC quarterback has done so, eight quarterbacks and two running backs have won the Heisman — yes, including Reggie Bush in 2005. Of those eight, only one would really classify as a pocket passer — Sam Bradford in 2008. Troy Smith, Tim Tebow, Cam Newton, Robert Griffin III, Johnny Manziel, Jameis Winston and Mariota all have some running ability that not only attracts voter attention but also makes a difference on the field.
If the Heisman goes to a QB again this year, it will probably be someone like TCU’s Treyvon Boykin or Clemson’s Deshaun Watson who are real dual threats. This year, though, it will probably go to a running back because LSU’s Leonard Fornette has  looked like the best player in the country.
That doesn’t mean that Kessler is not an exceptional quarterback capable of taking his team to the playoff. In fact, if he can lead USC to a conference championship, he’ll almost certainly be a finalist for the sport’s top honor.
As long as he doesn’t throw another interception this year.
He will be a bust like Barkley
Who’s the last Bruin QB to play in the NFL and succeed. Aikman decades ago, I’d worry more about the Bruins sucking then I would trolling an SC blog. Poindexter.

Tuesday’s practice seemed like a large exhale for the Trojans. After a much-needed win against Arizona State, the team looked like themselves again. And that meant a lot more smiles.
“We needed it. I think that we have been on an emotional ride here for two weeks, and a physical ride against two physical opponents. So having a few days off is not bad,” head coach  Steve  Sarkisian said after practice. “Especially having a Thursday game. So, I thought that the timing was good, and we’re just trying to take advantage of it: one, to get ourselves better and, two, to prepare to go forward.”
Despite losing their first conference game of the season, the Trojans responded with a convincing win against Arizona State, 42-14. It was the first time USC had beaten the Sun Devils since 2012, prompting the team to move up to No. 17 in this week’s AP poll. The game was largely over by the first half, after USC scored four Sun Devil turnovers and established a 35-0 lead.
“Oh, that was so fun. That was awesome. That was the best feeling ever,” freshman linebacker Osa Masina said of Saturday’s win and his first college road game. “That thing was so loud. It went from so loud to so quiet. And as an away team, that is just the best feeling. You feel like you did your job in someone else’s house.”
After losing to Stanford, the Trojans didn’t seem to take their foot off the gas in practice last week. Coaches and players alike moved with a sense of urgency. And USC looked more than ready to finally get back on the field Saturday against Arizona State. Quarterback Cody Kessler attributes his team’s success to those intense practices, which also helped the offense have its best game yet converting on third downs.
“Our guys came out and practiced third downs really hard on Wednesday, and they executed,” Kessler said. “It came down to us making our plays. The guys were challenged, and they bounced back and really took it personally, and we were really effective on third down.”
Kessler continued his Heisman campaign by throwing for 375 yards and five touchdowns but threw his first interception of the season. The quarterback says that he and Steven Mitchell weren’t on the same page, but it’s just something they have to learn from.
“My high school coach was really hard on me with that and always told me, next play, next play,” Kessler said. “And, there always is a next play. Even if you throw a touchdown or you throw a pick, whatever it may be — it’s about the next play.”
Sarkisian and the coaching staff unquestionably manipulated Todd Graham’s famous blitzes Saturday, opting for short throws to the perimeter that allowed Trojan playmakers the room to utilize their speed. Sarkisian credited Clay Helton for doing a great job of getting players open by utilizing schemes such as crossing routes, rather than relying on them to win their one-on-one battles. Kessler threw touchdown passes to four different Trojan receivers. JuJu Smith-Schuster led the way, catching five passes for 103 yards and two touchdowns.
“It’s amazing how much [Graham] blitzed. I mean, he was methodical and just kept coming and coming,” said offensive line coach Bob Connelly. “Pass protection was pretty good all night, so we had really good numbers. Because when you do that as a play caller defensively, you are expecting the defense to hold you, secondary wise, and obviously our receivers were making plays.”
With their first conference win under their belt, the Trojans looked exceptionally lively at practice. Because of their extended break before Washington, the young players were given more reps than usual in practice. Quarterback Sam Donald and safety Ykili Ross looked particularly sharp in 11-on-11 work. Coaches emphasized fundamentals, as players spent much of the time separated into position drills.
“Our young guys got a lot of work, which is what we are going to do for the next couple of days before we really start getting into game plan mode on Saturday against Washington,” Sarkisian said.
He added that extra time like this is incredibly important for players to focus on their academics, take care of their health and, for the freshmen, adjust to college life.
“I’m definitely more comfortable than when I first got here,” Osa Masina said. “My favorite moments are probably the games and coming out of that tunnel at home, or just practicing out here everyday with the guys. There is something special out here. So you feel good when there are a great group of guys.”
 
 
We really don’t know yet what kind of team we can expect yet. Always, with usc you have to filter thru the hype. After Notre Dame, we should know. For now I can live with being in the top 20/
The fairly sad fact is that the Trojans moved only to 17th in the rankings with a good win. The loss to Stanford created more doubt in the team’s ability than the win against ASU with the pollsters. They have to win out to make the top five in the country for a playoff consideration.

Sports are practically full-time jobs for Trojan athletes, but even for some of the most focused players in the Pac-12, like Natalie Donaldson, having a hobby is a way to get some reprieve.
The midfielder/forward often uses her passion for horses as a way to clear her mind.
“I barrel race,” she said. “It’s my passion. I really enjoy it. I think it’s really important to have something on the side that allows you to clear your mind, so horseback riding is a huge thing for me because I don’t think about anything when I’m out there.”
When she’s playing for the Women of Troy, however, Donaldson shifts into full force and focus. As a                                                       third-year veteran of the women’s soccer team, Donaldson has contributed to every position on the field, starting as a defensive player and working her way to midfield and forward positions.
“I think that I’m kind of home in the defense because I started out defense,” Donaldson said.
While reserve players shined against Riverside, every player in this year’s roster has a lot to prove on the field, including Donaldson.
According to Rachel Caton, USC’s assistant sports information director, head coach Keidane McAlpine projects Donaldson to play the most minutes on the field out of all the players this year.
This may not come as a surprise to someone like Donaldson. The No. 17 senior started playing soccer as early as three years old and then went on to play for the American Youth Soccer Organization and multiple clubs.
“I kind of threw everything else aside and put soccer first, and from there it was just all momentum,” Donaldson said.
Donaldson made her first collegiate soccer appearance at Auburn University, but later jumped at the opportunity to play for USC. Last year, she started in all 21 games for the Trojans and contributed in 19 games the year before that as a sophomore.
“I wanted to try something new, so I went to Auburn and figured out that’s not what I wanted, and I knew I wanted to be closer to home and closer to my friends and everything because that’s where I play the best. So I came here and felt at home immediately, ” she said.
Among other things that make Donaldson feel at home on the field is the mutual support she shares with her teammates.
“I look to almost every single player, even the new players,” Donaldson said. “If they tell me to do something, I’ll try it out. It’s a really great dynamic on the team.”
This year’s Women of Troy have already begun to improve to the tune of their “One Moment, One Now.”
“Every single person on the team knows their role and is willing to play any role on the team to contribute to our success,” Donaldson said. “I think everyone truly believes that this year. It’s not just a saying. Everyone actually believes it.”
Yet, Donaldson still recognizes areas for individual improvement in the coming games. Among her areas of improvement are getting more into the defensive mind, timing runs and strengthening contact with the offense and the defense.
“When to go forward, when to hold back a little bit more and I think it’s just getting our feet wet right now,” Donaldson said. “I think a lot is going to change.”
Next up for the Women of Troy is Washington State on Thursday and Washington on Sunday.
“I think it’s our mentality in the final third. It’s just getting it done,” Donaldson said. “The process we have down. We know what we need to do. We’re good at it. We just need to finalize it.”
Even as Donaldson approaches the end of her collegiate career, she has high hopes to continue her passion in whatever ways she can.
“I want to keep my options open. I would love to play soccer professionally, but we’ll just see what kind of opportunities present themselves,” she said.

When Imagine Dragons exploded onto the music scene in 2012, many assumed that they were an overnight success. However, it took many small gigs to get them to headlining the Hollywood Palladium. In a concert hosted by Citi and American Airlines, the alternative rock band discussed its humble beginnings, along with an electrifying performance of its most well-known songs at the Palladium on Sept. 28.
The night started off with an introductory video. In a roundtable discussion, lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, drummer Daniel Platzman and bassist Ben McKee reminisced about their first shows at Las Vegas casinos, where they played for small crowds and very little money. Gradually, the band built a following and eventually got signed to a label of their choice. As they transitioned into the spotlight, the members of Imagine Dragons never forgot their love for music.
“There’s a definite comfort playing music in front of thousands of strangers, expressing yourself through something you love,” Reynolds said.
Following Reynolds’ closing words, he appeared on the stage singing, “It’s time to begin, isn’t it? / I get a little bit bigger but then I’ll admit / I’m just the same as I was / Now don’t you understand / That I’m never changing who I am,” much to the crowd’s delight. Though the song, which launched Imagine Dragons to fame, is over three years old, the band aptly opened their set with it. Singing the chorus solo, Reynolds was later joined by the rest of the band, amplifying the excitement of the song.
After “It’s Time,” the set design accented each performance. With “Roots,” the band’s newest single, back panels on the stage showed brightly lit leaves as Reynolds chanted, “Another day, another door / Another high, another low / Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom / I’m going back to my roots.”
One of their better known singles, “On Top of the World,” featured lights that danced frenetically across the stage in the same excited way that Reynolds did. Additionally, the fire motif backdrop of “I’m So Sorry” highlighted the lyrics “So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go / You’ll never be loved till you’ve made your own.”
Interspersed between every couple of songs, Reynolds paused to share his band’s experiences. To preface “Amsterdam,” Reynolds told a humorous story about falling in a sewage latrine, much to his chagrin. But more importantly, Reynolds also revealed how he met the rest of the band. He had recently graduated from Brigham Young University and knew Sermon from high school. Sermon’s Berklee College of Music acquaintance, whom he described as “eccentric,” was McKee, a talented bassist who played for a jazz band. With Platzman on drums, they rounded out the band they are today.
Reynolds went into detail about feeling dejected at first when the band first formed in 2008. They played for cabana clubs and other venues that actually required the broke band members to pay them for unsold tickets. At the casinos, casino owners would allow them to play original songs in exchange for covering popular music from famous rock bands. This story cued the band to play “Won’t Back Down” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
Of course, there would be no Imagine Dragons concert without “Demons” or “Radioactive.” While singing “Demons,” Reynolds portrayed a sensitivity that can only be felt at live shows. And for the epic finale, “Radioactive” started with Reynolds, Sermon, Platzman and McKee in a melodic music jam session, drawing out the start of the song. Once the famous beat drop had arrived, Reynolds turned the Palladium into a fanfare, with the entire audience singing along with the band.
Ultimately, Imagine Dragons’ latest concert was a love letter to their fans. In an interactive setting, the band thanked the city it started in and the people that watched them from the very beginning. With Reynolds providing a chronology behind the band’s rise, audience members were able to relate to its songs on a completely different level. Now internationally renowned, Imagine Dragons made it clear that they would not forget the people who brought them to stardom.

We haven’t even hit the  middle of the semester and, yet, many of us have already gone through our first wave of midterms. I’ve been fortunate enough to have had mostly papers, but I am by no means exempt from my assignments all being due at the same time. As the semester officially kicks into high gear, so does the inevitable stress that persists all the way until finals. But there seems to be a misconception about stress. Most college students believe that if you aren’t stressed, you’re not doing enough. The important factor here, however, is that there is a difference between good stress and bad stress. As humans, we experience stress as a natural reaction. Positive stress can help with making quick decisions or even be a catalyst that makes us work more efficiently, but “bad stress” is when you’re in a constant state of tension. Being in this state for an extended period of time can lead to very dangerous results. Thus, we should be wary of using the “all college students are stressed” excuse to make this a habit.
As my final semester proceeds, I’m always on the hunt for resources that could help my fellow classmates in the future. This week I had the opportunity to explore one of the hidden gems on campus, the USC Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity. The Kortschak Center is primarily a place for students to meet with academic coaches and improve their time and stress management. The center, located on the third floor of the Student Union, felt very welcoming and open despite its small size. I was able to speak with Sarah Bui, a senior majoring in health promotion, at the front desk as she happily gave me more information on how things work in the Kortschak Center. If you’re looking to work with an academic coach, you first would make an appointment for consultation so that they can get a better understanding of your class schedule and your goals.
“Our academic coaches are part of the USC Rossier School of Education Master’s Program so they’re very well-versed in helping students organize their commitments,” Bui said. From here, you would be able to meet with an academic coach every week to make sure you’re sticking to a schedule and start turning your actions into habits.
As Sarah was relaying this information to me, it felt very conversational as opposed to someone just reading off of a fact sheet. It really helped me understand the importance and mission of Kortschak. With better time management comes better stress management.
“It’s important to manage our time because it gives us the backbone on how to discipline ourselves in every aspect of our lives,” Bui said.
Not only can students receive a more intimate focus with the help of the academic coaches, they are also able to develop short-term goals and build better habits on a regular basis rather than meeting just a few times a semester through other services. Not only does this develop better practices, but it also ensures that someone will understand you personally. What Kortschak seeks to prepare for students is the ability to develop skills that prevent stress from manifesting in the long term.
“Our space is here to foster a focus for learning and to help students with creativity and making things work for them individually,” Bui said.
Though we may believe that stress is inevitable, it’s more important to know how to harness your stress to improve your life rather than let it hold you back from achieving your goals. During this period of the semester and onward, be sure to remove yourself from situations that intensify your stress, whether that be a physical environment or a social one. To function at an optimal level, you must take care of yourself; continuous all-nighters and attempting to suppress emotional stress will eventually lead to a break that will set you off track even more than you already were. Take necessary precautions, research resources on campus that can offer study or stress tips and, most importantly, good luck on midterms.

Apparently, it’s fall. Despite the fact that the weather has yet to get the memo, many students are getting sick, whether it’s with the flu, a cold or bronchitis. Apart from taking medicine, there are a myriad of ways to bounce back from sickness, particularly making a nice, hot bowl of soup.
Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup
Chicken noodle soup is the go-to treatment for sick people, probably because it is both delicious and easy on a sore throat. This particular recipe isn’t very difficult and has a lemony flavor that keeps it light enough for the heat.
Cook time: 40 minutes
Serves 6
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
1 celery stalk, thinly sliced 8 cups of chicken stock or broth
Zest of 2 lemons
Juice of 2 lemons
1 bay leaf
1.5 cups orzo pasta
2 cups cooked shredded chicken
Salt and pepper for taste
Parsley (optional)
In a large pot, heat up oil over medium-high heat and add the onion, garlic, carrots and celery, cooking until tender for about five minutes.
Add the chicken stock, lemon zest and lemon juice and bring to boil. Cover, reduce heat and lightly simmer for 20 minutes.
Add the chicken and orzo to the pot, cooking until the pasta is tender for about 10 minutes.
Season with salt, pepper and parsley if you’re feeling fancy.
Adapted from Tide and Thyme.
Easy Pumpkin Soup
Fall also means the freshest stock of pumpkins, which can be transformed into this soup. Perhaps not as impressive as its roasted squash soup counterparts, pumpkins are still full of vitamins and iron that will help to get rid of that cold.
Cook time: 5 minutes
Serves 2
1 15-ounce can of pumpkin purée
2 cups of chicken broth or chicken stock
½ cup heavy cream
½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
Pepper for taste
Put all ingredients in a saucepan over medium to low heat and bring to simmer, whisking as you do so.
Heat for about five minutes. Add pepper to taste.
Adapted from the Food Network.
Broccoli-Cheddar Soup
For those who are more vegetable-inclined, try this cheesy broccoli soup. Though it might be the healthiest option on the list, since it is a heartier creation, this broccoli-cheddar soup is perfect for those who have regained their appetite after a period of not feeling well.
Cook time: 30 minutes
Serves 4
2 tablespoons of butter
1 small onion, finely diced
1 celery stalk, finely diced
2 cloves of garlic, minced

It’s sad, but true — if someone I know lands an impressive, sought-after internship, one of my first thoughts is, “Who do you know?” So much of today’s internship world is political, and success can often be determined by either being in the right place at the right time or simply “knowing someone.”
However, a lot of people — myself included — don’t “know” anyone. Thus, we must rely on networking. And for someone who self-identifies as an introvert, networking can be horrible, overwhelming and, at times, truly scary. It’s like that doctor’s appointment you’ve been dreading: It’s awful, but you know that it’s crucial and you’ll be happy once it’s over.
Many who fear introducing themselves may think they are alone and that networking comes easily to everyone else. However, according to Susan Cain, a recognized author and expert on introversion, one-third to one-half of Americans are introverts. And thankfully, networking involves everything introverts love: going up to strangers, self-promotion and awkward group situations. It’s a real party.
It’s hard, and USC could do more to make networking an easier and less painful process for students with introverted tendencies.
Despite the merits of big informational sessions and career fairs, their execution can be overwhelming and intimidating to students. I remember as a freshman dressing up in business casual clothes to attend an informational session for a company I admired. I immediately felt out of place. The room was stuffed with formally clad students armed with professional leather resume folders and shark-like personalities. That kind of situation better served people who thrive on social interactions and are more talkative and instantly assertive.
Cain explains in an interview with The Guardian that extroverted traits are overvalued compared to introverted traits when first meeting people.
“It really became the case that to stand out and succeed in a company, with people that you had never met before, the quality of being very magnetic, very charismatic in a job interview suddenly became very important,” she said.
However, just because some people can’t be “magnetic” in a matter of five minutes at a job fair doesn’t mean that they are less qualified for positions. More so, according to Cain, many introverts find self-promoting “distasteful,” making it difficult to open up and brag right after meeting someone. And being humble and unpretentious shouldn’t be something someone is indirectly punished for. Instead, in a smaller one-on-one setting, it might be easier for students to open up and share their skills. Even sitting down at a table at an event might make a situation more comfortable, as opposed to having a recruiter on one side of the table and a potential employee standing nervously on the other.
It takes an extreme amount of charisma to make a big impression in a matter of minutes, which is why for the sake of introverts — and the sake of everyone — more intimate networking and mentorship settings might prove more beneficial. It’s not a sign of weakness or laziness if someone can’t make a lasting impression in a matter of seconds. It’s actually quite normal.
It’s time to rethink the way we, as a university, approach the idea of networking. Some events that might be more beneficial are alumni sit-down events — any sort of experience that could get students and higher ups sitting down in a more intimate way. While it’s great to have NBCUniversal at an info session, those types of sessions benefit the company more — by increasing their application numbers — than students because they fail to create meaningful relationships between students and professionals.
There are so many amazing alumni in great positions who would probably be more than willing to be part of a “cocktail hour” or evening mentorship program.
And if I’ve learned anything from going to professional events, and actually snagging a few internships, it’s that those recruiters who speak to thousands of college students throughout the country are worth nothing. Instead, it’s that one close relationship you’ve made with someone who works in the ranks of a company who can put in a good word or let you know about an open position before it’s even posted.
On Wednesday, I’m attending the Annenberg Career Center’s “Food for Thought,” at Sony Pictures Studios. It’s the first networking event in my four years at USC that I’ve been excited for because it involves alumni serving as “mentors for the evening, sharing career advice, industry insights and professional development suggestions.”
In preparation for the event, we were asked our industry of interest, and we will have an assigned seat at a table to sit down and talk with alumni. There’s no sprinting up to people armed with resumes, and aggressive competition with my fellow students. That’s what attracted my annoyingly introverted self to the event.
More intimate events open to all students could be an extremely convenient resource for those students who have trouble with self-promotion and being magnificently charming in a matter of seconds. There may be more of us than you think.

This letter is in response to the Sept. 22 article entitled “WSA director speaks at USG senate meeting” that ran in the Daily Trojan.
As a senator representing the largest constituency in the student body, it is my duty to see that unelected bodies in Undergraduate Student Government, like the Women’s Student Assembly, remain mindful of the message they send to the public. Besides tuition, the student programming fee has also increased. Like tuition, students may not opt out. Issues arise when this mandatory fee is used to cover organizations that engage in outright partisan activity. The WSA stands among the top five Program Board assemblies that saw their funding increase the most from last year, receiving funding equivalent to one full year’s worth of USC tuition. Having the “privilege” of their resources to focus solely on the very pressing and crucial issues of sexual assault and domestic violence, the WSA has admitted on record to establishing relations with Service Employees International Union — a labor union known in California for going on the record and threatening our legislators into unconditional support of union policies, none of which bear direct relation to issues affecting our student body. Furthermore, while viewpoints throughout the spectrum are welcome, it is not constructive to unleash fighting words against an entire “oppressive patriarchal capitalistic structure of power,” which stands as a very vague and abstract concept at best. It is, however, clearly partisan, like SEIU. A senator is left wondering: Is the goal of this organization — with over $40,000 in funding — to take practicable, brainstormed measures against assault, or to engage in divisive politics?
The issue at stake here is one of radical political propaganda. It has become clear that there is a very partisan undertone underlying its goals. This political approach was even verified by the WSA’s director during the Sept. 22 senate meeting. This stands in stark contrast to what was said in an internal, USG-wide presentation the WSA made during the summer. In that presentation, the WSA claimed the actions it takes are not partisan. Ironically, this was a claim made after having presented its leadership’s antagonistic opinions on capitalism and economics as a professional field and academic discipline.
Furthermore, the WSA has student-funded resources that are, in one way or another, allowing the WSA to spend its valuable time correcting the spelling of words like “history” to “hxstory” and “women” to “womyn” and also to spread the libelous message that their dissenting peers form an “unholy alliance” that “exploit irrational fears about women’s sexuality” like it did in a 2012 newsletter. That newsletter directly targeted evangelical Christians and certain politicians for disagreeing with their views. Certainly, that is not conducive to the “safe spaces” it claims to support.
No one is taking a position against sexual assault and domestic violence prevention and awareness. The question here is if the WSA is wise in mixing partisan politics with what should be a nonpartisan goal, especially while claiming to represent all USC women in its very name. It is more a matter of philosophy than empirical fact when we generously choose to link a theory about “oppressive patriarchal capitalistic structures of power” to the real-life applications of helping and counseling victims and preventing future abuse. These conversations — which are indeed very engaging — can be explored by any independent student organization on campus, protected under free speech. But, when an official and unelected USG organization is entrusted with as much funding as USC charges in tuition, there is a degree to which it owes the diverse student body to remain reasonably above the partisan fray. Two organizations that live up to this standard are USG’s Wellness Affairs and USC’s Center for Women and Men, which are both aptly qualified to tackle the serious, nonpolitical health issues of assaults on campus and could make very good use of $43,000 in funding.
Giuseppe Robalino
USG Residential Senator
A few quick things…
1. Guiseppe wants to call WSA out for wasting time by changing the spelling of words by ONE LETTER, yet doesn’t think that writing an entire article trying to silence women and the people advocating for them is a waste of his time. Interesting…
2. He’s a classist moron (his facebook profile picture literally used to say “I’m part of the .0000003% that will no longer tolerate the whining and crying of the 99%” before he deleted it when someone shared it in an attempt to show USC students exactly who’s “representing us”) and he tries to say that no students here are affected by unions even though many of us have working class parents in unions…
3. And he has the audacity to call WSA out for our “fighting words” at a school where our motto is LITERALLY “fight on.”
tl;dr – this guy is a baby who’s whining about people sticking up for themselves when the issues they’re taking on don’t actively help him
I would like to let everyone in this conversation know that before writing this article, I made sure to make internal consults before writing my piece. For that reason:
1) I never stated that any USG WSA funding goes directly to SEIU. This was made clear to everyone in senate and can be found in senate minutes. I only alluded to an economic fact: opportunity cost. WSA has funding that allows to run its on-campus programs, and as such, has the “opportunity” to engage in such partisan affiliations. In effect, USG has provided a subsidy that allows WSA to engage in partisanship.
2) Unelected, here, refers to unelected by the whole student body. The context in this article is how WSA relates to the student body as a whole, therefore “unelected” is used in that context.
I hope this clarifies there was no intentional erroneous information on my part. My goal here is to provide transparency to the student body as a whole (as that is my senatorial duty) and provide actionable and practical solutions to continue to improve USG as an organization–whereby I am seeking to build up and strengthen, not dismantle and destroy. I stand by my words. I welcome all respectful, constructive dialogue in this very serious issue we have before us.
Giuseppe H. Robalino
Residential Senator
You still wholly misrepresent the work that WSA is doing on this campus. Further, you fail to detail what the relationship between SEIU and WSA consists of. Student organizations and assemblies interact with, are sponsored by, and even sponsor the presence of partisan groups and individual on campus all the time. This week, ESA, two of USG’s Committees, and the Academic Culture Assembly are hosting lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (and many speakers) to campus for their event Know Tomorrow. Kennedy has a national, partisan political presence, yet, I don’t hear you worried at all about the money spent on that.
You benefit from the structure of power WSA is working to breakdown. I have to assume that is why you seem so much more concerned about the nondescript ties WSA has with one organization, instead of realizing that the presence of WSA on campus does, in your own words, “build up and strengthen” a large group of your constituency through its programming.
Hi Giuseppe. As a member of the Women’s Student Assembly and one of your constituents, I’m calling BS on your statements. First, the fact that WSA has “established relations” with SEIU has no bearing on the resources and space that WSA provides. None of WSA’s funding goes to SEIU. Also, you claim to not to take a position against sexual assault and domestic violence, and yet you want to defund the student organization that does the most out of any other student group on campus to support survivors. Don’t say you care about the people when you’re trying to screw them over. If you care so much about saving money, you should cut your own salary because you clearly don’t actually understand how funding in USG works, which makes me pretty sure you don’t know how to do your job. 
Tl;dr: You are garbage. Please resign.
Very typical. You don’t agree with what he says and then call in garbage.
Sophia, I think the points that have been discussed in this article are very concerning. I, as a student, do not want my hard earned money going to an organization that claims it’s mission is to fight “oppressive patriarchal capitalistic structure of power.” Those ARE fighting words. I do think re-routing some of the funds from WSA to the Center of Women and Men would do great things. The CWM do much much more than WSA to combat sexual assault and rape on campus. I know, from personal experience, sadly, that WSA does close to nothing for sexual survivors on campus. CWM does much more, including a 24 hour hotline, transportation services to Santa Monica Rape Center, campus education programs, staff training, and administrative advocacy. CWM deserves those $$ more than WSA.
If you are a “ConcernedTrojan” then stand by your words and don’t use an anonymous account. The CWM is literally THE sexual assault resource center on campus, so yeah, I would hope that they do more than WSA to combat sexual assault. WSA is not meant solely to address sexual assault. If you think that gender-based violence is the only thing that women on this campus deal with, you are sorely mistaken.
Well, Sophia, you were the one that said that WSA was “the student organization that does the most out of any other student group on campus to support survivors.” Those are your words. You, yourself, just pointed out how baseless your comment was. 
I’m not saying WSA should be completely eliminated or taken off campus. I just think $43k+ in funding is absurd and perhaps some of the money should be rerouted to other orgs. 
Finally, I am concerned about the mission and vision of the organization. If WSA really cared about women, they would/should fight for a day-care center for single mothers who are students/faculty on campus. USC is one of the only major research university in this country that doesn’t provide childcare for female students/faculty. Maybe you can bring that up at your next meeting instead of talking about how to demolish “oppressive patriarchal capitalistic structures of power.”
CWM is not a student group.
hahahaha.
You obviously don’t know what CWM does.
CWM is, indeed, a student group. CWM oversees the Voice program and other peer programs that are organized and led by students. They do receive funding from USG. They are student orgs.
I’m beginning to sense a common thread among supporters of WSA. Is everyone that puts up some evidence against the group automatically “stupid” or “garbage?” How are ya’ll going to attract more sympathizers or supporters this way?
Do you know what a student group is?
Here is a description on the CWM website to help you understand that this resource center is run by actual professional staff, not students.
For added fun, I highlighted a section that mentions the CWM’s supportive relationship with WSA.
Also, I’m not a politician so I’m not interested in padding my words to keep up an image. I don’t need your tone policing. 
I’m a student with a voice. I can say what I want.
The Center for Women and Men is a Resource Center, not a student organization. Check out their website by looking up “The Center for Women and Men”. I think it’s pretty erroneous that you don’t know the different between a resource center, such as, for instance, El Centro Chicano, and a student assembly, such as the Latino/a Student Assembly. The CWM is a space that seeks to not only provide counseling to students who have experienced gender-based harm, but it also does preventative work in terms of educational outreach. It is thus both a Resource Center that WSA works very closely with, and a counseling center that is severely understaffed. It also just launched VOICE, a peer outreach program, which I’m really glad that you brought up because the sessions have begun and these kinds of programs are really needed at USC. Becuase CWM is not a student organization, nor under USG, they do not receive USG funding, and thus neither does their VOICE program. The program was organized by both students and staff members in CWM, and has been a long project for sexual assault advocates, but while students helped organize curriculums and missions, they program itself is being run by CWM staff. And finally, I will agree with you and say that CWM needs more funding, but that funding is never going to come from USG, because that’s not how money works at USC — they are two separate entities. All resource centers need more money, but that’s not going to come from USG. And WSA supports so much of CWM’s work that it would be difficult for them to function without the help of students, especially from WSA, so to invalidate the need for WSA by emphasizing the need of more resources for CWM is also contradictory.
There’s a difference between providing the kinds of services you mentioned that are upheld by professional staff vs. providing space and support, which WSA does provide and that is dismaying to hear you don’t recognize as someone with personal experience. 
$43k in funding is also relatively moderate compared to other assemblies and groups under Program Board, not to mention student government itself. For the article to assert that student programming fees going up is correlated to the WSA budget alone is absurd, not to mention putting it in conversation with a broader tuition hike.
Your last point also does not negate or discredit the organization’s goal or mission, or position a lack provisions for single mothers as contradictory to the purpose of providing space for women on campus in the ways that WSA already does.
The very idea that CWM and WSA are competitive entities as opposed to co-constitutive resources for students illustrates how little you know about either. Both work very closely together and are supportive of each others’ work, not to mention that the funding streams are completely distinct from one another. Additionally, as a branch of Program Board run by students (not professional staff), it’s not within WSA’s capacity to uphold services like a 24-hour hotline or transportation services; this is not a redundancy or an oversight.
This is a fine example of how this institution fails to educate its student leaders on relevant issues, thus highlighting the very importance of the programming that WSA has to offer.
Hi Natalie. The collective body of Program Board was as disappointed as you probably were when we saw this seriously misinformed and erroneous letter written by a member of USG’s Legistlative branch. While we already take it upon ourselves to educate USG’s members on our programming and its importance, we simply can’t get through all the time, as seen in this case. I thank you for your support and similarly echo your sentiments of a vision of a more educated study body.
