When senior Greg Irwin and graduate student Syuzanna Petrosyan submitted their short film Play for Your Life to the Student Voices Short Film Contest, they were aiming to move audiences and show a side of the Holocaust that was often left untold. Winning the contest came as an added bonus and welcome surprise for both.
The film focused on musicians who, after being placed into concentration camps, were forced to play music to drown out screaming coming from those killed by gas chambers or Nazi gunfire.
The film was inspired by recorded testimony from Alice Herz-Somner, a pianist who was the oldest living Holocaust survivor until her death in February at the age of 110.
Irwin and Petrosyan chose clips from the Shoah Foundation’s archives.
“It was definitely tough because we have to keep watching these moments and figure out how to make sure the emotions of these people being filmed will translate to the emotions of the audience,” Irwin said.
Herz-Somner closes the eight-minute film with a moving quote.
“Life is a school — we have to learn — and I learned this: Be thankful for everything.”
Petrosyan noted Herz-Somner’s message perfectly summed up the aim of the film.
“Alice’s message says it all: to be grateful,” Petrosyan said. “I hope the film inspires others to get more involved in human rights movements.”
Both Irwin and Petrosyan have a passion for human rights issues. They intern at the Shoah Foundation, which gives them the opportunity to get involved with human rights awareness activities on and off campus.
“Last year, I went to Rwanda as part as of USC Dornsife’s Problems Without Passports program with the Shoah Foundation,” Irwin said. “I got to interact with survivors of the Rwandan genocide and hear their stories.”
Irwin, a senior majoring in international relations, hopes to pursue a career in the entertainment industry following his graduation this spring.
“I currently have one feature film written that is going through rewrites now, which I wrote with a friend of mine who I’ve known since seventh grade,” Irwin said. “We are trying to get it passed around to studios right now.”
Petrosyan, however, has different goals. Though successful in the film contest, she mentioned she has no desire to work in the film business. A master’s candidate in the public diplomacy program at Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Petrosyan holds a specific passion for exploring human rights issues and abuses in history.
“I just want people to know you don’t have to be a filmmaker to create a documentary,” she said. “Editing took the longest because I didn’t know much about it and had only learned it a few months before Play for Your Life was made.”
Both found the experience of looking deeper into the Shoah archive to be very meaningful.
“It was pretty amazing to have that level of recognition and success with our film; someone even shouted ‘Bravo!’ at the end of our screening, which was neat,” Petrosyan said. “It was a great feeling since we had such passion for our project and a team of incredibly talented judges, including Rwandan filmmaker Eric Kabera. It was really special that we won.”

In partnership with the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, The Interfraternity Council hosted a Day of Silence event on Friday to protest the harassment of LGBTQ individuals and create a safer campus for students.

Day of Silence is a national campaign to raise support for LGBTQ students on school campuses and bring an end to the bullying of LGBTQ individuals. Events have taken place yearly since 1996.
USC’s event took place on Friday on The Row, where attendees were served food and received buttons to show their support. During the event, a minute-long moment of silence was held to comply with the Day of Silence tradition of using a moment of silence to raise awareness.
QuASA representatives were supposed to appear at the event as ambassadors for the LGBTQ community and provide attendees with more information about how to get involved but were unable to due to a scheduling conflict. They were also scheduled to speak to the attendees about LGBTQ rights and the purpose of Day of Silence.
Despite the setback, Sebastian Moya, IFC’s director of diversity, was happy with the turnout and believes the event had a positive effect overall on USC’s Greek community.
“Plenty of people came and were really interested in learning more,” Moya said. “I think the main purpose of the event was to make sure Greeks knew what was going on, and they’re becoming more aware of the problems that need to be addressed and how to resolve them.”
QuASA was not able to be reached for comment.

On Saturday night, the Black Student Assembly’s biannual SC Invite was shut down by security at The Lorenzo student apartments for alleged raucousness, but members of BSA claim the complaints were racially motivated.
Left out · Guests who were refused entry for the Black Student Assembly SC Invite at The Lorenzo Saturday night wait outside the venue. – Daily Trojan file photo | Daily Trojan
The issue started when Lorenzo officials limited the number of guests allowed for the invite on the day of the event, said Casey Ellis, executive director of BSA. Ellis claims that BSA received prior permission to host the invite with over 100 guests, but on Saturday, Lorenzo officials said the room for the event had only a 60-person capacity.
“It’s not a huge room, but it definitely holds more than 60 people,” Ellis said. “Last night, I searched the room, and I could not find a capacity sign posted.”
BSA was then allocated 60 guest registrations, but Ellis noted Lorenzo officials further restricted those allowed into the invite.
“The bulk of the issue came from that they weren’t even allowing residents of the Lorenzo into the venue … They told us [on Saturday] we could register 60 [outside] guests, and they were going to give us 60 wristbands, but then come time of the event, they decided they weren’t letting residents in either,” Ellis said.
Ellis noted that this miscommunication greatly impeded the event, with multiple BSA guests having to wait outside because they were refused entry. Soon after, Lorenzo officials shut down the event entirely, claiming it was “out of control” and “threatening,” Ellis said.
“Where the racial tension came in is with the comments that were made from staff and security about the event being ‘out of control’ and [Lorenzo residents] feeling threatened by our guests, by the vendors that we used, by the DJ that we used,” Ellis said.
One BSA member, who requested to remain anonymous, said the way guests were treated was “extremely racist.”
“I’m upset that [Lorenzo security] treated us so poorly and that black students on campus are looked at as savages, even though we were dressed in suits and dresses,” the student said. “It’s unfortunate that we continue to get looked at like this.”
Ellis compared the invite to “Globefest,” a mixer hosted by USC Program Board’s International Student Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly and Latino Student Assembly at The Lorenzo two days prior with hundreds of guests in attendance.
“If Thursday night we are part of hosting an event that was attended by over 500 people, and then we have an event where we have 50 people inside and 50 people outside, and you’re calling it out of control, and you’re saying you feel threatened, what’s the difference between the two events?” Ellis said.
She went on to mention that the specific comments were “racially coded,” and BSA plans to file official complaints with The Lorenzo shortly.
“This is not the first time where we’re having an event that we’re being told that we’re coming off as threatening,” Ellis said. “It’s racially coded language that we don’t appreciate and we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
Department of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle told the Daily Trojan that Lorenzo officials had called DPS to assist in shutting down the invite, as the apartment complex claimed that there was alcohol at the event and too many guests were at the party.
“Apparently there was alcohol present and the party grew larger than it was suppose to be,” Carlisle said. “Lorenzo management called DPS to help [Lorenzo security] intervene, however we stood by outside and left how the party was handled up to the Lorenzo management. They had ended the party because it had gotten too big and there was alcohol.”
Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, the previous executive director of BSA, denied the claims that alcohol was present, and said that dispersing the party did not require DPS involvement.
“We were not serving alcohol. It was a pretty family-friendly environment,” Amoafo-Yeboah said. “Most people were leaving on their own. [Lorenzo security] didn’t have any difficulties.”
Representatives at The Lorenzo could not be reached for comment.
BSA is holding a meeting Monday at 6 p.m. in Grace Ford Salvatori Hall room 106 to discuss the incident and is planning to issue a press release at the same time.

With just two practices and the spring game left before USC football hits pause until fall camp, there’s a new hype surrounding the team. It’s not the pressure and hype of 2012, nor is it the skepticism of 2013. It’s a feeling that, partly due to consistent dominance and partly due to constantly inflated expectations, is rare in the land of Troy. The feeling is genuine, true-blue hope. No caveats, no “but ifs,” — a legitimate, unadultered sense of excitement for what’s to come this fall.
Part of the reason for this outlook is USC being in the honeymoon period under new head coach Steve Sarkisian. Every new head coach is undefeated for about nine months after he or she is hired, and Sarkisian is emerging as a Pete Carroll Lite early on. He’s outgoing — schmoozing with former Trojan greats after practices and cracking jokes in his post-practice scrums. He’s also shaking up the offensive playbook, adding in sideline signs à la Oregon and boosting the pace to the point where every defensive lineman looks like they just a ran a marathon following practice.
More of this feeling, however, should come from stability up and down the Trojan starting 11s on each side of the ball. This is USC, so of course there’s enviable raw talent on the two-deep. The bigger factor to focus on is that USC has vocal leaders at every position group. There’s Josh Shaw and Su’a Cravens in the secondary, Hayes Pullard at linebacker and a once-shy, but now boisterous Leonard Williams on the defensive line. Max Tuerk looks like he’s moving to center to be the next rock of the offensive line, Nelson Agholor has the swagger of the top wideout he’s grown into and Buck Allen has come out of his shell to spearhead the Trojans’ best running back stable arguably since 2007. There’s hope at every spot, and every position leader has past performance to show us why the positive outlook is merited.
And then there’s the guy throwing the ball. As cliché as it might be, teams still live and die by their quarterback play, especially in Sarkisian’s pass-heavy, improvise-heavy offense. Last year, USC died by their QB play in the Washington State game, as the “having two quarterbacks means you have none” mantra rung painfully true. But when Cody Kessler was named starter for good, USC once again looked the title contender they were under Carroll. There was an ugly stretch (Notre Dame and Utah), but the team rallied as Kessler found his confidence.
There is a supposed quarterback competition between Kessler and former super-recruit Max Browne right now, but Sarkisian said last week that he’s naming a starter by the end of spring. Browne is no slouch, but all indications point to Kessler going into the summer knowing he’ll continue to take first-team reps in August. He loses to Browne in raw arm strength, but Kessler has deftly run Sarkisian’s offense in scrimmages and already has the locker room under control.
But the promising QB situation is still isn’t the prime reason fans should be hopeful for an unexpected run this fall. The real reason came to light on Jan. 8, when the 2014 schedule was released. USC once again does not play perennial power Oregon and also avoids Sarkisian’s former team in Washington, which has a similar upbeat outlook under new head coach Chris Petersen.
Instead, the Trojans’ most difficult road trip comes Week 2 against Stanford. The Cardinal, who lost the heart of their defense in graduating Shayne Skov and Trent Murphy, have to replace defensive coordinator Derek Mason after he left for Vanderbilt and need to find a new running back as well as consistency from QB Kevin Hogan. It’ll still be a tough sell, but if the Trojans find their early-season groove before the Cardinal, a season-changing win is very possible. Cody Kessler has beaten The Farm before, after all.
Apart from that, the schedule sets up nicely for the Trojans to head into late November with a full head of momentum. The Arizona schools are never pushovers, but the Trojans should be favored in all of their matchups heading into their Rose Bowl trip against UCLA in the second-to-last week of the season. Take my speculation as you will, but just as in 2013, the battle against the Bruins will have Pac-12 Championship implications.
It’s still early, and the annual injury bug hasn’t left its mark on the Trojans yet. But rather than the dread of 2013 and title expectations of 2012, USC goes into 2014 with a mix of upbeat anticipation and newfound confidence under the new Sarkisian regime. And as the Trojans showed us in 2011, memorable seasons can come when you least expect them.

USC’s women’s tennis team picked up two crucial wins this weekend to move into sole possession of fourth place in the Pac-12 conference heading into the end of the regular season.
Finisher · Junior Zoë Scandalis clinched both of USC’s matches this weekend, with 7-5, 6-4 victories against Arizona State and Arizona. – Jazmine Rolle | Daily Trojan
The No. 13 Women of Troy (16-6, 7-2) recorded wins over No. 19 Arizona State and No. 25 Arizona over the weekend at Marks Stadium in a victorious final homestand.
USC came into the weekend trying to get back on track after suffering back-to-back losses at the hands of California and Stanford. Head coach Richard Gallien was impressed with his team’s ability to bounce back from the losses with two wins this weekend.
“If we were at all limping after the Cal or Stanford weekend, this last weekend would have been really tough,” Gallien said. “Just from a mental toughness standpoint, I really give our team an A-plus because they were just very resilient.”
The Women of Troy started off the weekend strong against the Sun Devils (18-6, 4-4) on Friday with a 4-2 victory.
Since junior Sabrina Santamaria suffered a season-ending ACL injury in March, Gallien has used a slew of different lineups, which has made it difficult for the team to get into a groove.
“It really did take us a while to get our sea legs back and almost find out our new identity,” Gallien said. “Had this happened in January, in some ways it might have made it a little easier for us.”
USC’s doubles teams found their footing on Friday. Junior Gabi DeSimone and freshman Zoë Katz raced to an 8-2 victory on court three to get the Women of Troy on the right track. Next, senior Brynn Boren and junior Giuliana Olmos, playing on court two, clinched the doubles point with an identical 8-2 score to put USC ahead 1-0.
Olmos, ranked No. 76 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, continued her success in singles, increasing USC’s lead to 2-0 with a dominating 6-3, 6-1 win over her opponent on court five. ASU would close the gap, though, when No. 49 Desirae Krawczyk topped Boren on court two.
DeSimone put the Women of Troy up 3-1 with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over her opponent, but the Sun Devils kept it close when Kassidy Jump defeated senior Kaitlyn Christian.
With the score sitting at 3-2 in USC’s favor, No. 26 junior Zoë Scandalis clinched the match for the Women of Troy with a hard-fought 7-5, 6-4 win over 68th-ranked Stephanie Vlad on the top singles court.
USC closed out its regular season home slate with a sweep of Arizona (16-5, 5-4) on Saturday.
The Women of Troy came out of the gates strong, clinching the doubles point to go ahead 1-0. This time, Scandalis and Christian took home an 8-2 win on court one before Boren and Olmos topped their opponents, 8-4.
Once again, DeSimone, Olmos and Scandalis carried their team to a victory in singles.
DeSimone crushed her opponent by a 6-1, 6-1 score to put USC ahead 2-0. Next, Olmos dialed up a convincing 6-0, 6-2 victory on court five. For the second day in a row, Scandalis clinched the victory for the Women of Troy with a 7-5, 6-4 victory.
Gallien praised his team’s ability to fight through injury and beat two top-25 teams over the weekend.
“Right now we only have six people that are healthy,” Gallien said. “That doesn’t leave much margin for error. And of those six, believe me, half of them are playing hurt.”
USC must now prepare to take on UCLA to end the regular season. The Bruins have come out on top in the teams’ two previous matchups this season, but Gallien insists his team will play to win.
“You have to go there expecting to win,” Gallien said. “I think you have to have the mindset, even today, of visualizing things happening and playing well and not shrinking from it and not feeling sorry for ourselves.”
USC takes on UCLA Friday at 12:30 p.m. in Westwood, Calif.

A sliver of sun emerged on an overcast Sunday afternoon during the fourth inning at Dedeaux Field, when USC baseball scored its first runs of the game and didn’t look back.
Lace ‘em up · Sophomore shortstop Blake Lacey came up clutch in the Trojans’ victory over the Utes on Sunday, recording 4 RBI, including USC’s first two runs of the day and the runs that put USC up 6-1 in the 5th inning. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
In fact, the sun seemed to cut through the gloom during the most pivotal moments in Sunday’s 13-2 win over Utah, which pushed the Trojans to 17-17 overall, and 6-9 in Pac-12 conference play.
“It’s no secret we’ve been struggling to score runs, as has Utah,” said USC head coach Dan Hubbs. “But it’s like I told the guys: We lost one we probably should’ve won on Friday. We won one we had no business winning on Saturday with how many guys we put on base and found some way to Houdini out of it and then today we played a complete game. We pitched well and we played solid defense and we got a lot of hits.”
USC stepped up to the plate under pressure in the 4th, delivering a string of hits with two outs. After a gift wild pitch, sophomore shortstop Blake Lacey bulleted a single into left field, driving home the first two Trojan runs of the day.
Lacey played hero again in the bottom of the 4th, saving what could have been a break-open inning by scrambling to field a ball that ricocheted off sophomore pitcher Brent Wheatley’s back, stepping on second and throwing to first for an unassisted double play.
The Trojans would add six more runs off six hits the following inning, two in the 6th and 7th and another in the 8th to solidify their commanding win.
“I think it was good for them to get a lot of hits with men in scoring position and drive some runs in and see that they’re capable of doing it,” Hubbs said.
Wheatley would depart after 5.1 innings with one run and sophomore pitcher Kyle Twomey would pitch 2.2 scoreless innings in relief. After exhausting the bullpen in Saturday’s game, the two performances were clutch.
“For Brent to come out and do what he did and get us into the sixth and having Kyle [Twomey] ready, it really made it nice to have that lead,” Hubbs said. “We didn’t have to think about throwing in [sophomore] Kyle [Davis] because we’ve just been riding him like crazy.”
For the fifth time this season, the Trojans scraped by with a 3-2 walkoff victory on Saturday in the bottom of the 9th inning. It wasn’t as glamorous as some of the Trojans’ previous walkoffs, but for a team that relies more on manufacturing runs than producing them on power alone, the game-winning sacrifice fly was more than sufficient.
On Friday, junior right hander Wyatt Strahan recorded a career-high 11 strikeouts, but despite achieving a new personal best, the Trojans dropped the contest 4-3 in 13 innings. The outing brought out some of the best in Strahan, who was able to surmount shaky control early to end his night with 2 runs on only 2 hits in 7 innings.
The performance was all for naught, as USC struggled behind the dish, failing to take advantage of fruitful walkoff opportunities. The Trojans failed to plate runners in scoring position in the 9th, 10th, 12th and 13th innings.
USC has the day off on Tuesday, and welcomes Arizona for a three-game series, starting on Thursday at 7 p.m.
Hubbs hopes Sunday’s easy victory will propel them heading forward and that if the Trojans can continue to play complete games.
“We’ll start seeing what we think is the potential of this team,” Hubbs said.

If you’ve been on the internet recently (guaranteed as you are more than likely a college student reading this column), you’ve likely heard about Heartbleed. It’s scaring nearly every major site and server out there. Though an internet bug isn’t anything new, Heartbleed in particular has had every developer and coder working night shifts to avoid having their security completely compromised.
But through all the fear-mongering, which is genuine since almost two out of every three servers are vulnerable, many are still confused what, exactly, Heartbleed is.
The simplest way to describe Heartbleed is that it’s an exploitable programming error in OpenSSL, a widely-used piece of coding software. So it isn’t a “bug” in the strictest sense but rather an Achilles’ heel. The way it would work is that someone could use a virtual “handshake” with an HTTPS server using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL to access up to 64KB of private memory space.  By sending back a marginal amount of information back to the server, the server would respond back with 64KB from itself.
Though that’s hardly any significant amount of memory, an attacker can use it in a clever way so that it can repeatedly keep sending information back. Among the information that would be sent back and forth would be cookies, emails and passwords and doing it repeatedly can leak entire encrpytion keys, such as private SSL keys that monitor HTTPS traffic.
Now here’s where it gets really scary: By having access to a website’s private SSL key, an attacker could project a fake version of the website and directly steal any information that a user could send, be it passwords, private messages, credit card numbers; pretty much anything that you would want private is susceptible.  These attacks can neither be detected by users nor website owners.
Now many websites have already worked recently to patch up their websites but the list of sites that had been affected shows how vulnerable everyone was: Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr, Twitter, Dropbox, Google, Yahoo Mail, Etsy, GoDaddy and even entertainment sites like YouTube, Netflix, Minecraft.
To reiterate, the way Heartbleed would work is that if someone used the programming error in OpenSSL, they could put up a “false” front page of Netflix or your email host and whatever you would type would go directly to that coder. The implications are huge, since it is so easy to do. Though websites are constantly patching up their versions of OpenSSL to fix the potential exploit, there’s no way of knowing if an attack has occurred and no way to tell if it’ll happen anytime in the near future.
The frightening thing is that this has not only been a glaring error in OpenSSL for two years, but Bloomberg recently reported that the National Security Agency had known about the Heartbleed vulnerability shortly after the affected version of OpenSSL had been released.
The NSA denied knowing about the Heartbleed vulnerability prior to April 2014 in an official statement released last Friday. But if the potential overreaching of the NSA wasn’t already unnerving, consider the fact that for two years, hackers from any organization have had the capability to create “fake” versions of websites using OpenSSL and record anything that was input into that website at the time. And that respective website, be it Gmail or your Facebook, would be none the wiser and neither would the person that was being monitored. Though one would hope that if the NSA used Heartbleed to gather intelligence, that they only used it for suspicious activity, it’s doubtful they would be selective with such an effective means of tracking.
Now this might just be everyone overreacting since we always hear about how vulnerable we are were something like this to happen. For the most part, however, many of us still feel secure in putting our information in the hands of the internet.  This is a topic for another day, but our digital profile is becoming more and more robust — and we demand having that private information accessed on our end at all times.
The best thing you can do is what you should’ve been doing in the first place: change your passwords often, research what sites are and are not vulnerable and consider, if you must, a private encrypted browser (or add-on). Be smart, be diligent and always consider that even if you don’t think you’re being watched, it’s always a possibility.

When the tents go up, the readers come out.
Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
Vendors haul trucks of rare books, leather journals and comics to their stands. Bestselling authors brace themselves in preparation for the adoration of their fans, the sort that will spend hours waiting in line for a signature on a title page. Native Angelenos — or even those who found the weekend trip worth the expense — flock to USC’s campus carrying tote bags and rolling backpacks, all for the chance to bring home some of the best literary spoils of the year.
Attracting about 150,000 people each year, the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, now in its 19th year, took over USC’s campus this weekend. With big names such as John Green, Lisa See, Terry McMillan and athlete-turned-author Pau Gasol drawing large crowds, the festival made good on the promise it’s held in previous years: a fabulous time for lovers of the written word.
“People want to believe that they can be transformed, that events can transform their lives,” said Susan Squires, author of Waiting for Magic, at a Saturday afternoon panel titled “Fiction: A Love Story.” “And I think people want that again and again … They find a satisfaction in seeing that resolved.”
Though Squires was referring specifically to a question about why romance novels make up the most commercially successful genre of fiction, her insights can explain why people continue to read books at all. In an era where threats of the death of the novel and the irrelevance of literature run rampant, the Festival of Books continues to prove that readers still read and that writers still write. And with the enthusiasm and vigor that permeated through USC’s campus this weekend, the business of literature appears to be doing just fine.
But the Festival of Books proves more, of course, than just the fact that literature still holds a particular relevance (and reverence) in our culture. Amidst all of the cooking demonstrations, books stalls and cartoon characters entertaining the youngest readers, a genuine love for reading in all of its combinations abounds. Many festival goers — indeed, even the featured authors — are not only avid readers, but also creative writers. Some fans of romance also enjoy nonfiction; other readers are simultaneously fascinated by historical fiction and mystery. There are no boundaries, it seems, to the sorts of material one can read or write.
At a panel titled “Fiction in Brief: The Art of the Story,” which focused on the short story craft, author Jamie Quatro speculated on the multifaceted passions that reading can inspire.
“I love the compressed lyricism of the short story,” said Quatro during the panel. Quatro is a short story author who recently published his collection I Want to Show You More. “I love poetry. I love reading poetry … I think every short fiction writer should be reading poetry.”
Such dualism makes USC a prime host for the event. Though the Festival of Books has only been held at USC for four years — before that, it was located at the University of California, Los Angeles — the sheer number of USC faculty and alumni presenting at the event shows another sort of literary combination: a love of reading, teaching and research.
Faculty members such as Shana Redmond of the American Studies and Ethnicity Department gave talks on music and politics. English professors Leo Braudy and Dana Johnson discussed the relevance of truth across different genres. Aimee Bender participated in a panel on fiction and marginality, and on Sunday, the festival featured bestselling author T.C. Boyle.
The Festival of Books also boasted USC alumni among its featured writers, including Cecilia Velástegui, who gave a reading of her new children’s book, Olinguito Speaks Up, with the assistance of several USC students. Velástegui received her master’s in counseling in 1977, and since then, has gone on to have an illustrious career as an author.
“I’ve written four other books, and they’re all psychological thrillers with a lot of historical intrigue, but this one … it was something I couldn’t pass up,” Velástegui said to the Daily Trojan. “This little animal was discovered last summer. I was in between books, and it just kind of came to me all in the middle of the night. And I thought, ‘This is fabulous. I’ve got to write it.’”
Inspired by the discovery of the olinguito species, part of the raccoon family, last August, Olinguito Speaks Up tells a fabled story of an olingutio who learns to stand up for himself when his friend Tomás begins to tell longwinded tales to the rest of the animals in an Ecuadorian cloud forest.  The olingutio gave Velastegui a chance to write about larger environmental issues.
“I think the message was there,” Velástegui said when asked why she decided to turn the story into a children’s book. “It was very ready for me to write a children’s book that had a positive message along with a little bit of [sadness] about what we’re doing to the environment. I didn’t want to turn dark like I can sometimes in my novels, but I didn’t want to sugarcoat it too much …There are still a lot of things that we can discover, but at the same time, let’s really keep in mind that we’re losing a lot of our beautiful animals.”
Of course, for Velástegui, participating in the 2014 Festival of Books has an even greater significance: getting the chance to read her work at her alma mater.
“I’m looking at all of the [buildings] where I used to take my classes, and it’s like home,” Velástegui said. “It’s USC. There’s only one USC, and you feel at home when you walk back here. Like [time] never happened and you realize, ‘Oh, it’s been 32 years.’” She laughed before adding, “A little long.”
As the festival ends, Velástegui and the other authors at the Festival of Books finish the last of their autographs, putting the caps on their pens as they prepare to leave. The vendors take down unsold books from their shelves. The last of the festival-goers cram their books into their totes and load their purchases into their cars. And USC students on their way to Monday morning class will see the white tents coming down, the last physical marker of the weekend’s festivities.
But it’s not that the festival hasn’t left a lasting impression on visitors: Now that the excitement is over, readers will sit pouring over their books, waiting for next year’s event.

I am a bike rider who respects rules. I walk my bike in dismount zones, I always ride with a helmet and I properly lock my bike to racks. For these reasons, last week I was both surprised and angry to see that the Department of Public Safety had cut my lock and impounded my bike sometime between 5 p.m. and when I returned to it at 11 p.m.
I locked my bike to one of the new, paired bike racks next to the Student Union. Though there might have been a notice on my rack the day before, or one blocked by bicycles on a neighboring rack, there wasn’t one on my rack before or after my bike was impounded.
As a graduate student who lives seven miles off campus and doesn’t own a car, I immediately called DPS to retrieve my bike. I was then informed that bikes wouldn’t be released until the following morning. When I asked for help getting home so late at night, DPS recommended I “call a taxi.” Unfortunately, I couldn’t afford a cab, so at 11 p.m. with a dead phone, I took public transit and walked all the way home. Had it been just one hour later, the Expo Line would no longer be running, and I would have been stranded.
Having a bike impounded is a tremendous hassle for students, costing us a good amount of stress, time and money to retrieve our bikes and purchase new locks. Similarly, last week’s bike rack removals costs DPS in labor to tape up notices that weren’t visible, cut 100 bike locks, transport these bikes, store them and then have trained officers spend their day dealing with students who want their bikes back.
All this could be avoided if DPS’ bike rack removal notices were as clearly displayed as bike dismount zones and reached as wide an audience as USC Transportation’s parking and traffic announcements. The fact that this isn’t the case exemplifies the gaps in USC policies that make students, staff and faculty who choose cycling as their mode of transit feel like second-rate members of our community. I’m a student who pays tuition like any other student, and whose interests DPS and Transportation should take into equal consideration as those who choose to drive or ride public transit to campus.
For this reason, I call upon DPS to post bike rack removal notices with the same level of visibility and caliber as those used to mark bicycle dismount zones. This simple solution would go a long way in saving students, staff, faculty and officers unnecessary stress, time and money.
Fight on.
Matthew Gonzalez
Graduate student, master of public policy
 
Why would DPS have an intelligent and reasonable bike policy? That makes too much sense and goes against everything they stand for.

It was Equal Pay Day. And instead of paying attention during an international relations lecture, I was passionately retweeting the White House.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
“‘There are commentators out there saying that the pay gap doesn’t even exist … It’s not a myth, it’s math.’ — President Obama #FairFutureNow,” tweeted President Barack Obama.
President Barack Obama signed two executive orders recently. One, according to CBS News, “will prohibit federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their salaries, while the other will mandate that the Labor Department collect data on the compensation for federal contract workers, organized by race and sex.”
My first thought was, who could possibly disagree with this? It seems simple: President Obama wants to close the pay gap and create a fair work environment.
But when I looked into the topic, I realized the issue was far more complex — something that definitely cannot be summed up in 140 characters or less. So here I am, breaking away from Twitter to express my thoughts on the pay gap war.
The backlash to President Obama’s recent actions has unsurprisingly come from conservatives. But the criticism being aimed at him has no merit.
Regardless of my own political affiliation, I can understand when people disagree with our president over controversial issues such as as abortion or gay rights. These are emotionally charged topics, with proponents and opponents coming from various religious upbringings and touting vastly different messages.
I can also understand when people squabble over immigration reform or defense spending. These are issues that have been widely contested for ages, and though I have my own reservations about each topic and my own strong opinions, I can see both sides of the coin.
But in the case of equal pay, I’m shocked. Where’s the partisan for not wanting equal pay? Where’s the mathematical or economic one? The answer is easy — it doesn’t exist. There’s no reason for this type of anger when the president is making moves towards equality.
Admittedly, there’s more to the issue than what we see at the surface. Some critics dispute the statistic that a woman makes 77 cents to a man’s dollar. Reporter Ashe Schow at the Washington Examiner called this a comparison of apples to oranges.
“It compares female nurses to male lawyers, female secretaries to male economists,” Schow wrote. “When you control for occupation, college degree, experience and life choices (like women working jobs with flexible hours to care for their families), that wage gap virtually disappears.”
It’s also reasonable to say that women might be making less than men because they are less inclined to negotiate their salaries, a fact supported by Forbes, NPR and many other publications (in fact, Harvard Business Review maintains that only 7 percent of women ask for raises).
But regardless of how big the gap is or why it is there, we cannot deny that it exists. So, it’s time for us to address it.
In situations like this, it’s necessary to put party differences aside and realize President Obama’s executive order is a critical component in solving the bigger issue. Granted, his one action will not make all gender issues disappear forever, but no one cannot deny that it’s a step in the right direction.
For one, it’s a preventative measure. Employers, with the thought of a criminal punishment looming above them, would not even arguably think of paying their female employees less than their male employees.
Secondly, the executive order has brought women’s issues center stage in the United States. It’s practically become an antiquated topic. Who, after all, really sits down and says, ‘We’ve got to look at women’s issues when there are other problems in the world?’ It’s a rarity. Thus, it’s refreshing to see the president addressing this issue and finding ways to ameliorate it.
So in cases like this, it’s unreasonable for conservative voices to come out and make statements accusing the Obama administration of being “all talk.”
With Senate Republicans blocking legislation as sensible as the Paycheck Fairness Act, it’s time to hold our legislators accountable for their actions.  We can’t expect any real progress to be made when our legislators are too focused on protecting their party reputations.
Republican Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers, for example, made a string of statements recently opposing President Obama’s actions.
“… For women across America, it’s not just about equal pay,” Rodgers said in a statement. “It’s about achieving a better life. And the Republicans are acting on solutions to make that happen.”
This kind of rhetoric takes the spotlight away from the real issues, yet again dividing the parties on a topic as nonpartisan as women’s rights.
It’s time to come together and support the president on his endeavor to close the pay gap and promote equality. Because let’s face it, whether you like him or not, we can all agree that our mothers, our sisters and our friends deserve equal pay for equal work.
And until that happens, I’ll be hashtagging and retweeting all that I can.
