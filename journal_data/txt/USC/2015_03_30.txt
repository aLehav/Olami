President Barack Obama announced John Slaughter, a professor of the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Rossier School of Education, as a recipient of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring last Friday.
The White House bestows the Presidential Award to individuals and organizations to recognize the crucial role that mentoring plays in the academic and personal development of students studying science and engineering — particularly those who belong to groups that are underrepresented in these fields.
“At Rossier, we are committed to creating and maintaining a culture of mentoring and an environment in which all members of the community, students, staff and faculty support each other and foster each other’s success,” Slaughter wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We believe that the source for mentoring is a sense of caring, caring put into action.”
Slaughter began his career as an electrical engineer. He went on to become president of Occidental College and chancellor at the University of Maryland. He has also served as the first African-American director of the National Science Foundation.
As a joint faculty of engineering and education, Slaughter hopes to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields.
“John Slaughter is a visionary pioneer of mentoring in engineering and the STEM field in general,” said Yannis Yortsos, the dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, in an email statement to the Daily Trojan. “We are fortunate to have him at USC and treasure his advice and service.”
Slaughter is involved with the African-American community at Viterbi and hopes to inspire them through mentorship.
“He is also an outstanding role model for all engineering students and professionals, particularly for African-American and underrepresented minorities,” Yortsos further stated.
Karen Gallagher, dean of the Rossier School of Education, described Slaughter as a role model.
“Dr. Slaughter has long been a role model to so many of us in the USC Rossier School of Education, where mentorship is critical to the teacher-student relationship,” said Gallagher in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Along with 13 other recipients from highly respected institutions, Slaughter will receive his award at a White House ceremony later this year. In addition to being honored at the White House, he will receive a monetary award of $10,000 from the National Science Foundation.
“These educators are helping to cultivate America’s future scientists, engineers and mathematicians,” said President Barack Obama in a press release. “They open new worlds to their students, and give them the encouragement they need to learn, discover and innovate. That’s transforming those students’ futures, and our nation’s future, too.”
Throughout his career, Slaughter has been both a pioneer and an advocate for diversity in higher education and in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Gallagher said Slaughter found the intersection between his love for science and mentoring at USC.
“In a career that has been rich in well-deserved plaudits, Dr. Slaughter’s Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring captures the two things at the center of his remarkable career — a love for science and a commitment to nurture that passion in a diverse and always expanding group of students,” Gallagher said in an email to the Daily Trojan.

Liz McIntyre has stage-four pancreatic cancer, but thanks to the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, she is continuing to fight her battle.
As part of her treatment, McIntyre participated in FDA clinical trials hosted at Norris on March 28 and 29, trials she wouldn’t have been able to do had it not been for research and funding provided through Lazarex.
Dana Dornsife established the foundation in 2006 after clinical trials allowed her brother-in-law Mike to live far beyond what doctors originally told him. Dornsife, who together with her husband David is the namesake of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, wanted to give other cancer patients the same opportunity as Mike and started Lazarex to do it. Its name combines Lazarus, the man in the Bible who came back to life, and the name of an experimental drug that first helped Mike extend his life.
The foundation is a nonprofit that links cancer patients in late stages with clinical trials around the country and pays for their travel and lodging costs so they are able to participate.
“It is so morally and fundamentally wrong that these people who were just as loved by their family members were not going to be able to have the opportunity that Mike had because of the size of their checkbook,” Dornsife told the Daily Trojan in an interview last fall.
McIntyre is the latest beneficiary of an effort that has so far greatly exceeded Dornsife’s initial expectations. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths, and since there is no test to detect it early on, most people are already in stage four when diagnosed. McIntyre thought she had lost hope until she found Lazarex.
“People take it as, ‘when I got the news it’s a death sentence,’” she said. “Not for me — I’m going to fight as hard as I can. We’ve had good people and good treatment, including Lazarex that have come into our lives.”
Amid McIntyre’s battle, her husband Eric got a unique idea for how to help his wife’s cause.
“I was just lying in bed thinking about things about a year and a half ago, and this thought came to me about riding a bike around the perimeter of the country,” he told the Daily Trojan.
After Eric spoke with Lazarex, the foundation contacted a physician to review McIntyre’s case, which let to her inclusion in clinical trials at USC; Eric began planning his historic bike ride with support from Lazarex.
His trip will span 110 days, cover 7,200 miles and take him through 18 states. Eric will stop in cities along the way to speak, spread awareness about pancreatic cancer and raise money for Lazarex. After planning and training for a year, Eric will begin his ride on April 19 in New Orleans, where he and Liz live. The ride will take them west to California, north to Washington, east to Minneapolis and south back to New Orleans. McIntyre will be by his side driving a support and gear, in cycling parlance SAG car, for as long as her treatment will allow.
Eric calls the bike ride a “victory tour” because of the role clinical trials have played in extending Liz’s life.
“The person I’m doing it for, the love of my life, is alive. This is a trip of appreciation and joy and blessing,” he said. “I think we should celebrate that and use it as a springboard for raising awareness and money at a time when money can do a lot of good.”
The McIntyres visited the USC Norris Cancer Center over the weekend to lay the groundwork for Liz’s participation in an FDA clinical trial arranged by Lazarex that holds the potential to extend McIntyre’s life. They decided to delay the start of the tour, which will come through Los Angeles in early June, because they wanted to go through the clinical trial and the tour as a couple.
Remarkably, McIntyre has lived for two years since her diagnosis — 75 percent of patients die within the first year — thanks in part to clinical trials.
Dornsife said more must be done to publicize the importance of clinical trails for developing effective cancer treatments.
“Every drug that we have available today is available as a result of completing a successful clinical trial,” she said. “Unless we are able to enroll and engage patients and complete that research loop by successful completing a clinical trial, we’re not going to get new drugs, treatments or cures on the market place.”
The McIntyres praised the rapid pace of innovation in cancer treatment, particularly the role that clinical trials have played.
“Five to 10 years ago, there wouldn’t be any choices,” Eric said.
Ultimately, Liz McIntyre hopes the drive to further cancer treatment will be just like her husband’s motivation to travel around the country: one that never stops pedaling.
“I hope this victory tour and what I’ve been going through will do for pancreatic cancer what Susan G. Komen did for breast cancer awareness,” she said. “I think we are on the brink of some breakthrough technology that will help people like me and others.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Eric McIntyre set up Liz McIntyre with clinical trials at USC and that Lazarex planned his bike ride. Lazarex actually contacted a physician to enter Liz in clinical trials, and Eric planned the bike ride with support from Lazarex. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Two new international executives, William McMorrow and Heliane Steden, were added to the USC Board of Trustees this weekend at the annual Trustee conference. Both alumni have served on USC’s President’s Leadership Council and have contributed funds and expertise to USC since graduating. The members will begin serving on the board in June.
William McMorrow is chairman and CEO of Kennedy Wilson Holdings, a global real estate investment and services firm. Following McMorrow’s purchase of the company in 1988, Kennedy Wilson has expanded from one office with 11 employees to 25 offices located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Jersey and Japan.
McMorrow established and endowed the William J. McMorrow Global Real Estate Program at the Marshall School of Business. The program offers undergraduate students the opportunity to study international real estate in the United States and abroad and also connect with mentors.
President C. L. Max Nikias said McMorrow’s commitment and leadership will be a great addition to the board.
“Bill McMorrow is a leader of great integrity and vision, and remains committed to ensuring that our students are prepared to thrive in our interconnected world,” Nikias told USC News. “He has demonstrated unflagging dedication to his alma mater, and we all look forward to his contributions on the board.”
Marshall Dean, James G. Ellis said he is happy to add another dedicated Trojan.
“Bill McMorrow is a very loyal Trojan who has supported his alma mater in so many ways,” Ellis said in an email to Daily Trojan. “Having his clear and creative thought process as a member of the Board of Trustees will make him a very welcome addition. We all look forward to working with him.”
Steden is a managing director at Merrill Lynch, and a member of the company’s New York international office. At Merrill Lynch, she provides private banking services. Steden joined the company after having successful careers at Bankers Trust and Deutsche Bank.
Steden is a former three-time USC All-American women’s tennis player and endowed a scholarship in her name, which is the largest gift to USC Athletic Department from a former USC female student-athlete. Steden was also a part of USC’s 1983 and 1985 NCAA championship tennis teams and earned three United States Tennis Association single titles and three doubles titles.
Nikias said Steden’s international work and commitment to USC will benefit the board.
“Heliane Steden’s vast and varied experience in international business make her an invaluable asset to our board,” Nikias told USC News. “She has distinguished herself not only through her incisive investment acumen, but also through her abiding commitment to philanthropy. USC is very fortunate to have the benefit of her continued guidance and support in her new role as a trustee.”

The 19-year-old University of California, Berkeley student who went missing early Saturday morning after leaving a USC party was found dead near USC’s campus on Monday.
At approximately 2:30 a.m., Eloi Vasquez was struck and killed by a 2009 Chevy Impala traveling at 60 mph as he was running across the eastbound lanes of the 10 freeway near Vermont Avenue and Washington Boulevard, according to California Highway Patrol Officer Ramberto Salcido.
Vasquez, a member of the Berkeley men’s soccer team, was visiting USC’s campus along with his teammates Josh Morton and Marko Helfrich for spring break when he went missing Friday night. He was last seen at 1:55 a.m. before leaving a party at Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house on W. 28th Street. Vasquez left the party, telling friends that he wanted to go to the beach.
Vasquez was last heard from at 2:18 a.m. when he called a friend his friend and fellow Berkeley student Aurora Cardenas and told her that he was alone and did not know where he was.
When he failed to contact Morton and Helfrich the next morning, they became worried and filed a report with DPS and LAPD, in addition to passing out flyers near where Vasquez was last seen and at local beaches. Following the news of his disappearance, Vasquez’s family drove all night Saturday from their home in Marin County, California, to organize a search effort.
On Sunday, his family offered a reward of $100,000 — increased from $50,000 — for any information leading to Vasquez’s whereabouts and safe return.
Cal Athletics released a statement on Monday mourning the freshman midfielder from San Rafael.
“We are absolutely devastated at this tragic news, Eloi was a wonderful young man who excelled both athletically and academically and came to Cal with a passion for learning. This is a tremendous loss for our men’s soccer program, our athletic department and our whole university community,” Cal Director of Athletics Mike Williams said.
Vasquez leaves behind family and many close friends who remember his positivity.
“Eloi had a way of making you laugh,” Cal senior Alex Mangels told reporters outside of Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. “He brought energy to the room every time he was with us. We all saw how much he loved his family and how much he put into the game. He loved soccer and it was his passion.”

Two weeks ago, Kenneth Branagh’s remake of Disney’s Cinderella opened in theaters to mostly glowing reviews. Despite the fact that the basic story remained largely the same, Branagh’s live action retelling dazzled and shined with its inventive use of color and an endearingly earnest storyline, going on to earn $336 million worldwide.
That isn’t to say the movie’s publicity hasn’t had its fair share of hiccups, however. Debate and outrage sparked soon after the film’s release when audience members were particularly disturbed by the ballroom scene where Cinderella finally dances with the prince. In the scene, Cinderella wears a sparkling cerulean dress, gifted to her by her newfound fairy godmother.
Audiences and critics alike took to the Internet to call attention to Lily James’ extremely tiny waist. Some argued that a waist that size couldn’t be achieved without CGI, while others complained of the viciously high standards young girls would hold themselves up to after seeing James’ figure in the movie. James herself was required to respond to the allegations in several interviews, but maintains that her naturally small waist, in addition to costume designer Sandy Powell’s voluminous skirt, simply created an “optical illusion” when filming, and no CGI was used at all. The Internet was basically placated by this answer, and the controversy subsequently disappeared after the first week and, of course, didn’t hurt sales in the least bit.
But I find myself wondering, maybe the controversy should not have been about the costume designer’s use of corsets or Lily James’ impossibly tiny waist, but whether the story of Cinderella needed to be regurgitated in the first place. We already have Disney’s classic 1950 animated version, not to mention a slew of others, such as 1997’s Cinderella (starring Brandy and Whitney Houston) and 2004’s A Cinderella Story with Hillary Duff. When looking at these remakes, we must beg the question: why Cinderella in 2015?
In an environment where Disney’s blockbuster hit Frozen was lauded for its feminist undercurrents when it premiered in 2013 and went on to gross a staggering 1.2 billion worldwide, the notion that we might have taken a step back with Branagh’s remake weighs heavy in my mind. Frozen is ultimately about two sisters who find the power in having love for each other. Cinderella? Not so much girl power involved there. The basic story is about a young, beautiful, extremely gentle girl trapped by her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters, forced to do their incessant, superfluous chores and accept their emotional abuse until one day a prince finds her and — after a bit of a “boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back” timeline — whisks her away to happily ever after.
Arguments can obviously be made on either side concerning Western society’s storied insistence to imprinting the idea of happily ever after into young children’s — especially girls’ — minds. I remember growing up watching countless Disney movies as a child, and while they were beautiful and magical and doubtless classics, looking back on it, I question the amount of fantasy forced onto such a young brain. I grew up with the notion I would find someone to marry and all would be swell for the rest of my life, but I have since realized the falsity in that idea as a young woman in the 21st century when a third of marriages end in divorce in America and an increasing amount of women are even choosing not to get married — citing financial independence and freedom of choice as two defining factors when considering marriage.
In fact, a whole slew of media today centers on the very notion that life isn’t as happily ever after as we were taught it would be growing up. HBO’s series Girls is a particular show to note: in the first season, Lena Dunham’s character Hannah Horvath must face the startling realities of being a 20-something and fending for herself in the real world. A tagline for the show is “Happily whatever after,” connecting the cognitive dissonance between what the characters believed life would be like, and what it actually turned out to be.
So, if we take into consideration the current state of disillusionment among young adults growing up today and the problems that arise when we realize things don’t turn out exactly how they’re planned, why remake a film that sets up these problems for future generations to come?
Not only does the film perpetuate the unreal idea of happily ever after, but it provides a female protagonist who is only able to lift herself out of her abusive home by waiting for a fairy to give her a beautiful dress, transform her into someone more glamorous and beautiful, and then meet a man who can only recognize her in real life by having her try on a shoe. How are young girls supposed to glean a blueprint or pathway for their own life when they’re provided fairy tales with little to no basis for truth?
The one positive aspect I can find in this new slew of remakes of aged stories is the fact that Disney announced Monday they would be remaking their animated Mulan (1998) into a live action feature. Thankfully, Mulan, though not without its faults, is a story about a young woman who decides to pose as a male warrior in order to take her invalid father’s place in the Chinese military and thus avoid retribution from the Chinese government. I, for one, am excited to see that remake; I’m not so sure about Cinderella.

Despite having flown across the country just a few hours earlier, the dynamic conductor James Conlon marched down the center aisle of the University Church to begin rehearsing Giovanni Paisiello’s “Barber of Seville” with Thornton School of Music instrumentalists. Conlon greeted his young charges with a smile and immediately proceeded to get down to business. This includes engaging with the young musicians in a collaboration, an intrinsic partnership between the conductor and the musicians to perform music from centuries ago to the delight of today’s opera audience.
A native New Yorker, Conlon has spent the past 35 years creating and performing a tremendously broad repertoire with musical forces from around the world. Following formal training at the Julliard School, in 1974 he was engaged as the youngest conductor for the New York Philharmonic Orchestra’s subscription series and in 1976 at the age of 26, made his New York Metropolitan Opera debut.
Early on, he served as music director of several prestigious European organizations including the Cologne Opera, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and the Paris Opera. In 2006, he returned back home to America to begin his tenure as music director of the LA Opera.
During the past eight years, he has assimilated into the fabric of musical life of Los Angeles, which he considers his second home.
Collaborating with the young musicians such as the Thornton players is at the heart of Conlon’s core values. He is deeply committed to imparting the worth of classical music to create life-long appreciation for generations to come.
“Our biggest challenge today is to preserve the practice of classical music in our society,” Conlon said. “At no other time in history have there been so many excellent musicians coming out of schools and conservatories. But educating an appreciative public in the last 30 years has been a dismal failure. When classical music fell out of the public schools curriculum, the stage was set for a situation where today only a tiny fraction of our population attend concerts. The trend has to be reversed.”
Performing Paisiello’s “Barber of Seville” is the culmination of “Figaro Unbound,” the latest offering from the LA Opera. It is a joint project with LA Opera’s Young Artists vocalists and Thornton instrumentalists. The piece was written and first performed in 1782.
Based on a play by French playwright Pierre-Auguste Caron de Beaumarchais, it is centered on a single character, a clever servant named Figaro. The libretto or text is tailor-made for an opera buffa (comic opera). It is filled with delightful musical tricks, which account for its original popularity and success.
An adaptation of Paisiello’s beautiful aria, “Cavatina ‘saper bramate’” was used in Stanley Kubrick’s 1975 film Barry Lyndon based on the 1844 novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray. The film starred Ryan O’Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee, and Hardy Krüger and recounts the exploits of a fictional 18th-century Irish adventurer. Exteriors were shot on location in Ireland. At the 1975 Academy Awards, the film won four Oscars in production categories.
The aria is built on a memorable haunting melodic line that has withstood the test of time, hence its appearance in Kubrick’s modern-day film. In the original orchestration, a male singer is accompanied by mandolin and pizzicato strings.
It is a centerpiece of the lyrical tune that the audience will walk away wanting to hear again and again.
A few years later in 1816, another Italian composer Gioachino Rossini decided to write his own version of “The Barber,” which eventually eclipsed the earlier Paisiello composition and is widely performed around the world today.
LA Opera’s “Figaro Unbound” project has included performances of a trilogy of operas based on plays by Beaumarchais: “Rossini,” “The Barber of Seville;” Mozart, “The Marriage of Figaro;” and Corigliano, “The Ghosts of Versailles.”
“An overriding benefit of enrolling in the Thornton School is to study with the excellent faculty and to have opportunities to work with world class professionals such as Maestro James Conlon,” said Anne-Marie Cherry, a doctoral candidate in horn performance.
Another member of the Thornton ensemble, cellist Benjamin Lash, a graduate student studying violoncello performance, said working with Conlon was an inspirational experience.
“Mr. Conlon brings an engaging storytelling element to the rehearsal. He inspires the players with his vast knowledge and thorough understanding of the musical score.”
Conlon, the LA Opera’s Young Artists Program, and the USC Thornton musicians will perform Paisiello’s “Barber of Seville” at Caroline’s Loft in the Los Angeles County High School of Arts on April 10 and 11.

The No. 1 women’s golf team won the Liz Murphey Collegiate Classic for the second year in a row at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, over the weekend.
The first round of the tournament began on March 27 and the Women of Troy were able to claim a spot in the winners bracket for the following two days. Junior Kyung Kim led USC with a 3-over 75 to help the team claim a spot in the winners bracket.
The top eight teams qualified to continue play the following day, and USC tied for seventh place with a combined 29-over 317. At the conclusion of the first day, USC was 16 yards behind first-place UCLA.
Kim led USC at 3-over 75, tied for seventh, with two birdies on the day while junior Annie Park tied for 11th at 4-over 76 with four birdies on the day. Freshman Amy Lee tied for 40th at 10-over while sophomore Gabriella Then tied for 48th at 12-over. Sophomore Karen Chung finished 59th at   15-over 87
Though the team struggled to qualify for the second day, the Women of Troy had a much improved showing on March 28. USC defeated UCLA 3 and 2, and Duke 4 and 1, in the quarterfinals.
Against UCLA, Lee won 5 and 4, then won 3 and 2, and Chung won 2 and 1. Against Duke, Lee won 4 and 3, Chung won 2 up and Park won 2 and 1 to win the match. Kim was leading by two holes when play was stopped.
Lee and Kim won their final matchups and the team held an 8-5 advantage on tiebreakers, having a bigger difference in matches won to edge out the Bulldogs. Lee handily won her match, 6 and 4. Kim won 2 and 1 for USC’s other point. Chung fell, two and one, as did Then, 3 and 2.
With the wins, the Women of Troy moved on to face the host team, University of Georgia, in the final round on March 29. After trailing for most of the day, the Women of Troy came from behind to win the Classic. This was their seventh top-two finish this year.

After two weeks of competition, we finally have a Final Four. Of course, the one year I didn’t pick No. 1 seeds to be the majority in my Final Four, three of the four remaining are a No. 1 seed. Michigan State is a seven seed, but that can hardly be considered a surprise. The Spartans seem to always come into the tournament underrated and manage to constantly upset higher-seeded teams thanks to the coaching of Tom Izzo.
It’s easy to pick teams like John Calipari’s Kentucky or Mike Krzyzewski’s Duke. They are constantly seeded at the top of every tournament alongside Rick Pitino and Louisville.
I know better than to bet against Michigan State, but even I had them losing to Louisville in the Elite Eight. Shame on me and the rest of us for overlooking one of the best coaches in college basketball.
Michigan State’s return to the Final Four ends a five year Final Four absence, the longest of Izzo’s 20-year tenure as Michigan State head coach. He has reached the Final Four seven times and is the only coach to reach three Final Fours as a five seed or lower. Despite his storied career, his Spartans seem to be overlooked every year.
His stats as Michigan State head coach make it hard to argue against him. As the Detroit Free Press has compiled, in 20 years Tom Izzo has won 494 games, 233 Big Ten games, seven Big Ten championships, four Big Ten tournaments, and has reached 13 Sweet Sixteens, 7 Final Fours and won a national championship in 2000.
His seven Final Fours outnumber his failed Sweet Sixteen appearances at five. In other words, Izzo has only ever failed to reach the Sweet Sixteen five times in 20 years with Michigan State.
Even when it seems like his team is out of the game, he somehow coaches them back to a victory. The Spartans have been behind at the half in five Elite Eight games under Izzo and they’ve come back to win four. One of those games was Sunday’s overtime win over Louisville to advance to the Final Four. The Cardinals had won the last 94 games when leading at halftime by six or more points, but the Spartans snapped that streak.
In this year’s tournament, Kentucky is the overwhelming favorite and I haven’t talked to a single person who didn’t pick them to win it all in their bracket. There are two other No. 1 seeds left, Wisconsin and Duke, and the Spartans will have to get past Coach K and the Blue Devils to reach the finals.
I admit that I picked Kentucky to win it all, but now that my bracket has no chance of winning, I’m jumping on the Izzo bandwagon. I always root for the underdog, but given everything I’ve just mentioned, it’s hard to classify Michigan State as an underdog. Nevertheless, they entered the tournament as a No. 7 seed this year and are left among a trio of top seeds.
Duke had to battle to get past Gonzaga and reach the Final Four, and Michigan State is coming off a thrilling overtime win over Louisville. If the Spartans are able to get past Duke, they’ll likely have to face Kentucky. The Wildcats barely bested the Irish to reach the Final Four and finally showed their vulnerable side.
I think it’s time we stop betting against Izzo and the Spartans.
Regan Estes is a sophomore majoring in public relations and Spanish. She is also the sports editor of  the Daily Trojan. Her column “Wild Wild Westes” runs on Tuesdays.
Izzo is a top five coach no doubt. What is the point of the article unless he is coming to USC which of course is not happening.
The Daily Trojan needs to dig into the failure of the basketball programs both men and women at Figueroa and Jefferson not
worry about Michigan St.

After sweeping two home spring break matchups against Marquette, 11-4, and Saint Mary’s, 20-7, the USC women’s lacrosse team packed their bags and left the sunny fields of Southern California for their second East Coast trip of the season.
Looking to extend their six-game winning streak, the Women of Troy battled with a winless Dartmouth team on Saturday in Hanover, New Hampshire, before traveling south to face No. 2 ranked Boston College in Newton, Massachusetts, on Monday. The trip marked the second time that the Women of Troy have traveled east this year. They dropped a 7-4 affair to then-No. 16 Stony Brook on Feb. 21 before rallying to beat Marist, 11-7, the next day during a frigid New York trip earlier in the season.
On Saturday, USC found themselves in a close clash with a surprisingly resilient Dartmouth team that, although winless, was fairly battle-tested entering the game. Three of the Big Green’s seven losses on the season were to top-15 ranked opponents, and in two of those three games, the team managed to keep the score within five goals (a March 7 loss to then-No. 10 Princeton, 8-5, and a Mar. 21 loss to then-No. 14 Penn, 10-5).
Dartmouth jumped out to an early 1-0 lead on a goal from junior midfielder Jaclyn Leto six minutes into the game, but the Women of Troy responded with four straight goals en route to a 5-3 halftime advantage. The match was essentially even from that point forward, as USC’s four goal second-half output was matched by the Big Green.
The game became especially tense with 7:41 remaining, when sophomore Dartmouth midfielder Taryn Deck put home a shot past USC freshman goalie Gussie Johns, bringing the score to within one at 8-7. That tally would remain constant until just over four minutes left, when USC junior attacker Caroline Cordrey scored her second goal of the game to pad the lead for good at 9-7.
The victory marked the seventh in a row for the Women of Troy, the longest in the young, three-year-old program’s history. Sophomore attacker Michaela Michael once again stuffed the stat sheet for USC, winning four draw controls, scooping up three groundballs, forcing two turnovers, and a garnering a   hattrick with three goals scored. Cordrey’s two goals helped bolster the attack for the Women of Troy, and junior attacker and team points-leader Caroline de Lyra added a goal and two assists of her own.
In addition to Saturday’s victory being a seventh-straight win for the team, it also marked the eighth-straight game in which the Women of Troy’s defense held the opposing team to seven goals or less.
Monday’s matchup with         No. 2 Boston College provided a huge test for the Women of Troy before they finish out their MPSF conference play in April. And though the 16-12 final score tilted in the Eagles’ favor, the heart and fight shown by the Women of Troy served as an indication that good things may be to come in the coming weeks leading up to the MPSF Conference Tournament that begins on April 30 in Denver, Colorado.
USC game out of the gate firing in the first half, jumping to a 4-2 lead in the opening seven minutes on the backs of junior midfielder Amanda Johansen and sophomore attacker Cynthia Del Core, who each put home two goals during that time frame. Boston College’s 10th-ranked scoring offense (14.27 goals per game entering Monday) overpowered USC’s eighth-ranked scoring defense (6.78 goals allowed per game), however, as the Eagles put home 10 goals in the next 20 minutes to take a strong 12-7 lead into halftime.
The second half told a more balanced story, with the Women of Troy slightly outscoring the Eagles 5-4 and taking advantage of seven second-half Boston College turnovers. A goal from Cordrey with just under seven minutes to play cut the defecit to four for USC, but, neither team would score again in the game.
Johansen was huge for the Women of Troy, netting four goals while picking up two ground balls and draw control wins. De Lyra dished three assists and added two goals of her own, bringing her team-best season point total to 42. Del Core, Cordrey and Michael all added two goals as well, and Johns made six    second-half saves to keep hope for a full rally alive.
Boston College was lead by a talented trio of midfielders, as juniors Caroline Margolis (three), Sarah Mannelly (four) and senior Mikaela Rix (four) all recorded hat-tricks for the hometown Eagles.
Despite the Monday loss, the Women of Troy find themselves in a good spot heading into the final weeks of conference play before the MPSF Tournament at the end of April. The team’s only three losses this season have been to ranked nonconference opponents, with Monday’s competitive four-goal loss being the largest final-score deficit of the three.
The Women of Troy have shown resilience throughout the season and will look to continue their solid play Friday on the road against Oregon. The match will be the first of a remaining six conference games, and is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m.
The game will be covered by the Pac-12 Networks.

USC’s No. 10 rowing team competed in the 42nd annual San Diego Crew Classic Saturday and Sunday in Mission Bay.
Saturday’s action saw four USC boats qualify for finals including a defense of the Jessop-Whittier Cup (V8) and the Karen Plumleigh Cortney Cup (V4). The Women of Troy were also competing to win the Jackie Ann Stitt Hungness Trophy (2V8) and the Carley Copley Cup (3V8).
The varsity eight placed second in the collegiate varsity division, finishing behind Texas by just under two seconds. In the varsity four division, the Women of Troy were able to win with a time of 7:43.95, which was over 15 seconds better than second place.
As Sunday morning rolled around, the four remaining USC teams were ready to take to the water. Defending their previous championship, the 1V8 team was able to beat out the competition in the women’s collegiate varsity division. The win is USC’s fifth consecutive and the seventh time overall that they have garnered the Jessop-Whittier Cup. They also won in 2001, 2007, 2011-2015.
The Women of Troy finished with a time of 6:38.15. Their closest competitor was top qualifier Texas, who finished with a time of 6:39.74. Third place was rounded out by the University of British Columbia who ended their race with a time of 6:46.16.
The Women of Troy were led to victory by senior coxwain Kellyn Freire. Junior Madara Strautmane was at stroke for USC, and she was followed in the bow seat by senior Elizabeth Turner, junior Lindsay Gibson, junior Keret Einaste, freshman Alice Riley, junior Darian DiCianno, freshman Dorottya Bene and freshman Marliis Reinkort.
USC was unable to defend its Plumleigh Courtney Cup in the varsity four-plus grand final. Though the Women of Troy started out strong, crosstown rival UCLA was able to maintain its pace and pushed ahead in the second half of the race and finished with the win. The V4 team finished three seconds behind the Bruins with a time of 7:48.98.
The Women of Troy’s 2V grand final was also foiled despite an intense race that came down to the final moments. Both Texas and UCLA overcame the Women of Troy in the final 200m. The top three finishing teams were within three seconds of each other, blowing away the rest of the field, with the closest competitor 12 seconds slower.
The other race that the Women of Troy were able pull off the victory in was the 2V4 final where they blew closest competitor University of San Diego out of the water. The Women of Troy crossed the line in 7:57.58 while the Toreros finished the race in 8:04.88.
Calling the race for USC was sophomore Pecko Lin. Freshman Katie Hubert was in stroke for the Women of Troy, and she was followed by freshman Isabel Fitter, junior Katherine Plaxe and junior Megan Linney in bow.
The Women of Troy have nearly two weeks off before their next competition which will be on April 11. It will be an away race against UCLA at Marina del Rey.

On Saturday, a car collided with an oncoming Metro light rail near Exposition Park, injuring 12 people, leaving one person in critical condition. The driver, a USC student, missed the “watch for trains” warning while making a left turn, causing the crash. The crash, which happened right off of campus, not only affected the USC community but also invited a heated, city-wide debate over the current Metro system layout and safety, shedding light on how much still needs to be done.
I couldn’t be a bigger proponent of the city’s public transportation system. Walking is my main mode of getting from point A to point B and my only form of recreational exercise, a way of living that I’m sure deviates from the driving majority. When the going gets tough and my legs give out, I’ll hop on a bus or train to continue my journey. Thus, I wholeheartedly support whatever funding the Metro system is receiving for its expansion and efficacy. I’ve noticed, however, through my two years of Los Angeles train-hopping experience, that the Metro is no London Underground or Taipei MRT. It’s not even the New York’s MTA.
Despite its lackluster transit currently in place, Los Angeles has been trying to match other cosmopolitan public transportation efforts in recent years. The construction of the first phase of the Expo Line (from downtown L.A. to Culver City) in 2006 cost $930 million. Phase two, which extends to Santa Monica, is costing $1.5 billion. New stations were added to the Expo Line three years ago, and currently, Metro  oversees many projects, including the extension of the Purple Line to reach Beverly Hills and Westwood, and a train to take people directly to LAX. To provide L.A.-area citizens with an alternative to driving, which requires a costly vehicle and exhaustive energy during traffic hours, these plans must be carried out.
And then there’s the issue of safety. Anyone familiar with Metro would know that the sides of the trains are covered with a black and yellow cautionary messages. The accident on Saturday is a reminder that a simple PSA on the sides of trains are not enough to ensure traffic safety. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Blue Line poses the most danger to the communities it runs through. Since 1990, Blue Line trains have struck and killed 120 people. What needs to happen, according to USC engineering professor Najmedin Meshkati, is for the Metro to be more clearly separated from oncoming traffic, isolating the Metro pathways completely with fortified structures such as gates.
Metro spokesman Marc Littman has protested this development, saying that, “All over the world there are trains operating safely in dense, urban areas. You can’t build a bubble around a rail system.” Littman’s argument is flawed because the pedestrians and drivers of Los Angeles can’t simply be expected to follow traffic directions. The city’s infrastructure differs from that of other metropolitans — it’s mainly dependent on local roads and freeways, whereas the railways in “dense, urban areas” Littman describes can be installed underground without worrying about earthquakes. Therefore, traffic destruction can be avoided.
As Los Angeles becomes more conscious about the benefits of public transportation, a few improvements must be made. That starts with strengthening the breadth and safety of the city transit system.

The accident had nothing to do with the train or safety of the train. It was caused by a horribly bad driver, who was driving an illegally registered car without proper insurance. These kind of drivers are the ones who run red lights, run over pedestrians, and crash into other cars. It could be a pedestrian or car he hit but it just happened to be a train. There is tremendous pain and suffering caused by drivers like him on a daily basis. There is no more to the story.

As a frequent rider of Metro Bus line 81, I have expressed to friends and family that “I hate L.A. Metro.” I have frequently ridden a train sitting next to stinky men, experienced buses arriving two minutes off schedule (atrocious, I know) and once had a bus break down twice while I was on it.
It is on that note that I begin this piece as a defense of the system that I love to hate, but in reality makes my life cheaper and easier.
This weekend, a tragic accident occurred at the Expo Line stop in Exposition Park that left a dozen injured and one in critical condition. Despite the fact that the traffic light was red, lights were flashing and the “watch for trains” sign was visible, a car turned left into the oncoming Metro train. The train car hit had bright yellow banners wrapped around it to warn drivers of the train.
Many are using the accident to claim that L.A. Metro needs to do more for the safety of drivers and pedestrians. Some even claim that in order to maintain safety, pedestrians and cars have to be separated from trains with physical barriers or by putting trains above or below traffic.
If the city were to operate under that logic with other forms of transportation, we’d have to put gates on crosswalks to protect pedestrians from drivers who don’t take the whole red light situation seriously. After all, Los Angeles does have the second highest rates of pedestrian deaths in any city in America.
According to the Railroad Administration’s acting administrator Sarah Feinberg, “[94] percent of grade crossing accidents are linked to a driver’s behavior.”
The reality of the situation is that there are thousands of other trains in big cities that function safely among the urban sprawl.
“You can’t build a bubble around the rail system,” Metro spokesman Marc Littman said in response to the accident this weekend.
Los Angeles is already taking big steps to making trains, buses, cars, bikers and pedestrians even more compatible and safe. In late February, Los Angeles released the newest version of an incredibly comprehensive plan for the Metro system. Their goals include putting safety first, creating world-class infrastructure, giving access to all Angelenos, maintaining a clean environment, and collaboration, communication, and making informed choices.
One of their main goals is to implement “enhanced networks” in which different modes of transportation are given priority on certain roads. Such networks will certainly decrease accidents like the one this Saturday by putting cars in fewer positions where they need to cross rail tracks.
Additional initiatives involving the L.A. Metro system include adding more bike racks on buses and implementing “first-mile, last mile solutions” that make travel to and from transit locations safe and easy.
This new plan, titled “Mobility Plan 2035,” is still in its formative stages and is currently open to public review. The plan is such a giant overhaul that it is expected to take 20 years to complete, but in its perfect form, it will solve a lot of crucial safety issues being raised by Metro critics.
L.A. Metro, you are not perfect. But without you, I wouldn’t be able to get to my internship or fully experience all the crazy people in Los Angeles. Once the Mobility Plan is fully in effect, you will just be even more lovable.

Last week Judah Joseph, public relations director of the Concerts Committee, wrote a letter to the Daily Trojan lamenting the lack of funding for his organization.  He has a point: The 2014-2015 total USG budget increased by $71,273.03 (3.76 percent) compared to 2013-2014, but the Concerts Committee budget decreased by $2,908.09 (1.06 percent) over the same time period.
Joseph quotes an article I wrote for the Daily Trojan entitled, “USG salaries established as the highest in Pac-12,” to emphasize that the USG budget is relatively small compared to other schools, but USG still “receive[s] quotes that are two or three times higher than quotes for other schools.”
However, the solution Joseph proposed ignores an action that USG can take without asking students for more money:  cutting student stipends.
As I already reported in the article that Joseph quoted, USG student stipends are much higher than stipends in other Pac-12 schools. However, while the Concerts Committee had its funding slashed this year, USG increased student stipends by $10,092.43 (4.24 percent). Instead of spending another 10 grand to pay themselves, USG should have spent that money on concerts and other programming for USC students.
Joseph opens his article by writing that his committee serves undergraduate students. It’s time for USG as a whole to better serve undergrads and pay themselves less to leave more room in the budget for concerts.

great article.  It is kind of ridiculous how USC USG has more than twice the average stipend expenses than the Pac-12 average
Concerts?? Are there not more important thing that the undergraduate community should be spending money on? Like something, I dunno, educational or for student-made culture or helping the most vulnerable students or those hardest up? Seems like giving T-Pain more money to be terrible is probably the worst thing we could spend money on.
While I understand where this may be coming from, this response is very misinformed. First of all, one of the main reasons that USG student stipends increased is because new positions were added that were paid, not because they were getting paid more. Even if that was the case, that extra $10k+ would be divided between all the committees and assemblies, and would not just be given to concerts. 
And to understand USG better, specifically Program Board, there are Directors and Assistant Directors in each committee and assembly, but only Directors get paid. Directors are required to put in 10-12 hours per week (and that’s how much they’re paid for) and Assistant Directors are required to put in 4-6 hours per week (without any pay). However, I know for a fact that they all regularly put in twice that amount of time per week (because sometimes thats what it takes to put on major events) and are not compensated for overtime. Yet you never hear them asking to be paid more, but instead, they ask for the student programming fee to be increased which means that more money would be put toward programming events which requires more hours for them which again, they would not be paid for. They do what they do because they are passionate and want to put on the best programs for students.
I don’t think it’s fair to ask that student stipends get cut from USG without cutting student stipends all over campus just because they are the ones who program the events that you may or may not enjoy. They have a difficult task of catering to the needs and wants of an entire student body while having to work with varying USC departments and many outside vendors to ensure that each event is safe and enjoyable. I agree with Jonah that if students are complaining about certain events, they should either get more involved, be more informed, or be willing to increase the programming fee (even by $2!) to make the campus events bigger and better.

Recently, The New York Times reported on a campaign that aims to put a woman’s face on the $20 bill. Hopefully, this can be achieved in 2020, the 100-year anniversary of women’s suffrage in the United States. Though many support this campaign, there is much debate about who should replace Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States. There is no better time than now for an influential woman to claim the position that Jackson should not have filled in the first place.
A genocidal racist and an opponent to currency, Jackson currently resides on the $20 bill. By removing the seventh president of the United States off of the $20 bill, the Women on 20s movement believes that this will allow for progress to be made in the movement for gender equality. On the Women on 20s website, it states, “Let’s make the names of female ‘disrupters’ — the ones who led the way and dared to think differently — as well-known as their male counterparts. In the process, maybe it will get a little easier to see the way to full political, social and economic equality for women.”
Susan B. Anthony is the most popular candidate for the $20 bill. Anthony is the epitome of a maverick. Refusing to accept social norms, Anthony started the first women’s movement in the United States and insisted that working women should manage their own money. Anthony viewed money as a vehicle for political and social change, and spent the majority of her own money supporting women’s right to vote. It seems fitting that the American people repay this much loved and revered historical figure by putting her on the $20 bill.
Another inspiring candidate is Wilma Mankiller, the first female Cherokee chief. During his presidency, Jackson was known for having supporting and enforcing the Indian Removal Act, which displaced and relocated numerous Native American tribes. The Cherokee march became known as the Trail of Tears, in which 4,000 Cherokees died of starvation, cold and disease. A descendant of one of the survivors during the march, Mankiller went on to become the first elected female Cherokee chief. Mankiller advocated to improve healthcare, government and education. While believing in the rich culture of her ancestors, Mankiller led her tribe with the utmost grace and courage. It would be symbolic to replace Jackson with a woman who prevailed even after her tribe was brutally mistreated.
Sojourner Truth is another candidate for the $20 bill. Truth was born into slavery; her sense of freedom, however, remained alive through her spirit. Separated from her children and the man that she loved, Truth continued to value friendship and loyalty. After attaining her own freedom, Truth went on to give talks about universal adult suffrage. Regardless of sex or gender, Truth believed that everyone had the right to vote. Truth reminded others that racism and sexism must be fought together. Truth’s story reminds us that all of our struggles are felt and shared by all. By placing her on the $20 bill, Truth can inspire those who feel marginalized or simply forgotten.
It is an interesting time for all women in America. Instead of putting each other down, we are endorsing powerful women who have forever impacted history.
Ultimately, any of these women could rightfully replace Jackson on the $20 bill. Each candidate truly embodies the triumphs and tribulations of being a woman in America. Now is the time to repay these women whose stories have been ignored for too long.

Right across the street from Taper Hall, nestled in a small courtyard, sits the Good Karma Café that serves all-you-can-eat vegetarian buffet open to the public. Organized by the Office of Religious Life and the United University Church, the Good Karma Café offers unlimited food for only $10.
Tuesdays they serve Indian food, and Wednesday’s they serve pasta. Though I cannot attest to the pasta, I can definitely assure you that the Indian food on Tuesday is worth your money.
On the day I was there, they were serving Kitcheree, a curried basmati rice with Mung beans, vegetables, herbs and spices. I could sense the curry’s aroma the very moment I walked down the stairs and into the restaurant. As with any typical Indian food, the rice was rich with spicy flavor. There was also the option to add hot sauce, but they say it tends to vary in strength, so sometimes one spoonful could be more than enough.
Good Karma also had an organic spring mixed salad with Divya’s Almond Dressing. THough the salad itself was rather uncreative, consisting of mainly leafy greens, the creamy dressing made it special. Its exquisite taste made me want to put it on top of everything on my plate, not just the salad.
For dessert, they had blueberry Halava, which is a flour based Middle Eastern dessert and for drinks, Guanabana lemonade. Their sweet lemonade was freshly made and refreshing for a hot spring day.
In addition to the great food, the café’s possesses quite a friendly ambience. Everyone comes in with containers to take home seconds, something that’s actually strongly encouraged. The sitting area is cafeteria-style, with large round tables where people sit down and strike up conversations with complete strangers. The owners have Indian music playing softly in the background, and you can choose to also sit outside and enjoy the warm California sun.
If you are free Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., you should definitely try it out. There is honestly no other healthier and better option on campus than the Good Karma Café.

The UC Berkeley student who went missing Friday night after a USC party has been confirmed dead, officials said on Monday.

Nineteen-year-old Eloi Vasquez’s body was found early Saturday morning on the 10 Freeway near Vermont Avenue and Washington Boulevard, according to the USC Dept. of Public Safety as well as local news sources.
California Highway Patrol Officer Ramberto Salcido said that Vasquez was running across the eastbound 10 Freeway when he was hit by an oncoming vehicle going 60 miles an hour.
“[The driver] observed the pedestrian and attempted to stop, but struck the pedestrian,” Salcido said.
Vasquez was pronounced dead at the scene due to his injuries. He had no identification on him at the time.  He might have accessed the freeway by walking up a nearby on ramp.
Vasquez, a member of the UC Berkeley men’s soccer team, was visiting USC’s campus along with his friends and teammates Josh Morton and Marko Helfrich for spring break when he went missing Friday night.
He had left a party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house early Saturday morning on West 28th Street, and told friends he wanted to go to the beach. He was not heard from since then.
Vasquez’s family reported he was missing on Saturday, and drove down from the Bay area to facilitate in the search. The family was offering a $100,000 reward for any information leading to his location.

I-10 is about twelve lanes of traffic going at least 60 — no sane person, no matter how drunk, tries to run across that, particularly at 2:30 AM while impaired.  Given the panicky nature of his calls to his girlfriend in Berkeley just before his death, and the fact that he told people at the TKE house he was “going to the beach” — hours away on foot — there is a clear pattern of profoundly altered judgment consistent with some type of drug other than — or in addition to — alcohol.  As a serious athlete he was unlikely to be a druggie.  Pending results of a toxicology test, I’d say a serious and intensive investigation is warranted.  Anyone who attended the TKE party should immediately compile a list of guests known to have attended the party so that as many can be interviewed as possible, as soon as possible.
How awful.  I can’t even imagine what Eloi’s family must be feeling right now.  
I agree there should be an investigation into what substances were given to Eloi and in what manner.  Wandering onto a freeway, much less attempting to run across it, is not easy to do mistakenly and suggests more than alcohol was involved.  While I admit I don’t know the legalities surrounding this, I would think that TKE / whoever was responsible for distributing these yet to be determined substances could be criminally liable.
Running across the 10 freeway at 2:30 AM.  Any chance anyone plan on looking into what was being served at that TKE frat party?  And was was a 19 year old being served it.

This year’s NCAA Tournament has felt different. It just has.
Perhaps it is because of the conspicuous absences. No Florida. No Michigan. No Connecticut. No Syracuse. Even tournament regulars like Creighton and St. Louis failed to make the field of 68.
Or maybe it is because this year’s edition of March Madness has not been that mad at all. The mayhem has been lukewarm. The bedlam that has come to define the NCAA Tournament was present for the first couple of rounds (looking at you, Georgia State and UAB), but the drama subsided by the round of 16.
The biggest surprise of this year’s Sweet 16 was NC State. Sure, the Wolfpack defeated a one-seed in Villanova in the third round. But this is an NC State team that went over .500 in the ACC and posted impressive regular season wins over Duke, North Carolina and Louisville. Not exactly a Cinderella.
Last year, Dayton battled Stanford for the right to play in the Elite Eight. Two years ago? Wichita State faced La Salle in the Sweet 16 (a nine-seed vs. a 13-seed), while Florida Gulf Coast captured the hearts of millions of Americans with a remarkable run that featured improbable upsets and exhilarating alley-oops.
We cannot have an FGCU in the Sweet 16 every year. But this year followed the script a bit too well. In 2011, Butler and VCU met in a Final Four clash. And, of course, in 2006 George Mason officially messed up everything we thought we knew about everything when they knocked off Michigan State, North Carolina, Wichita State and Connecticut en route to a Final Four berth.
So, where were we? Ah, yes. Three one-seeds have found a home in the Final Four this year, which has left us with mundane headlines but has simultaneously given us two heavyweight fights in Kentucky-Wisconsin and Duke-Michigan State. The underdog stories are captivating and defy our expectations, but there is also something to be said for the traditional powerhouses taking center stage in early April.
There will be infinitely many Final Four previews, trailers, promos and primers out there. Some will say Kentucky will win, no questions asked. Others will hop on the Badger Express hype train and laud Frank Kaminsky for being the best player ever. Some will claim Jahlil Okafor and Duke will overwhelm Michigan State, while others will point out how Tom Izzo’s Spartans are peaking at just the right time and are capable of winning it all.
Nothing I write in this column in terms of Final Four predictions will blow you away. There will be plenty of predictions out there, much like there will be ungodly amounts of analysis about 19-year-olds playing on this pressure-filled stage.
You will read those articles, as will I. But it is in our human nature to look back, to reflect and to ask “What if?” from time to time. As fans, it is fine to bulldoze ahead during March because the tournament has such a whiplash effect on viewers, meaning it is dangerous to dwell on any one team’s departure from the tournament. It moves too fast. There is too much looking ahead to do. Your bracket is in shambles after the first slate of games, so you flip the switch to “forget about my bracket” mode and subsequently realize the short lifespan of the tournament itself is far more depressing than your erroneous bracket.
Before you know it, boom. Tourney’s over. It is coming, and quite frankly, it is a little sad. But let us just pretend for a minute here. Let us just say that Notre Dame had beaten Kentucky, that Arizona had avenged last year’s loss to Wisconsin, that Louisville had defeated Michigan State and that Gonzaga had pulled off the upset against Duke.
It could so easily have happened.
Jerian Grant hits that buzzer-beater for Notre Dame and shatters Kentucky’s perfect season. Sam Dekker does not drain that dagger of a looping three-pointer in crunch time for Wisconsin, and Arizona wins in dramatic fashion. Mangok Mathiang sinks that second free throw to put Louisville up by one with just seconds to go, and Michigan State’s final shot at the buzzer somehow stays out. Gonzaga finds a way to quell the Blue Devils’ late surge, shocking Coach K and Duke.
Missed opportunities are the very fabric of the difference between winning and losing. I get it. But the Final Four would have felt so different without any one-seeds.
Arizona-Notre Dame would have been an intriguing matchup. Arizona’s Kaleb Tarczewski and Notre Dame’s Zach Auguste are powerful interior players, while the fans would have been spoiled by getting to watch two of the best athletes in the entire tournament—Arizona forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Notre Dame guard Jerian Grant—play on the same floor.
As for Gonzaga-Louisville, Kevin Pangos is an elite talent and directs traffic effortlessly for the Bulldogs, but Louisville is long, strong and more talented in the paint. For Rick Pitino’s Cardinals, Montrezl Harrell is a matchup nightmare, and Terry Rozier’s hands actually never stop moving on defense.
In this alternative Final Four, it is virtually impossible to identify a clear favorite. However, I think Arizona would have defeated Louisville in the title game. Despite Pitino’s savvy and experience in big games, I think Sean Miller’s Wildcats would have won it all. Behind veteran guards T.J. McConnell and Gabe York, the Cats could have attacked the Cards in a multitude of ways. Tarczewski gave Wisconsin big man Frank Kaminski fits at times in their Elite Eight encounter, but he still would have had his hands full with Louisville’s size and athleticism in the paint. Luckily for the Wildcats, with the one-two punch from their guards — in addition to the consistent production from Hollis-Jefferson — they would still have been in a manageable spot and could have played inside out if Louisville’s big fellas were marshaling the paint successfully.
Oh, right, I have been using the conditional tense here. None of that was real. Kentucky, Wisconsin, Duke and Michigan State have already taken the only four seats at the cool kids’ table.
Notre Dame-Arizona, Louisville-Gonzaga and Arizona-Louisville, however, would have been incredible contests. May those hypothetical games rest in peace.

The vote to confirm Loretta Lynch as the new Attorney General has been delayed interminably and still has an uncertain result. This situation is frankly baffling as it seems like common sense for Republicans in the Senate to finally confirm Lynch and replace Eric Holder who intends to retire as soon as his replacement is appointed.
The most obvious reason why this confirmation should have been a breeze is that the Republicans simply detest Holder. From his gun control views (or “violations of the Second Amendment,” according to conservatives) to his purported tendency to use racial politics for political gain, Holder is the ire of talk radio hosts from coast to coast. Conservatives should relish the opportunity to oust him at the nearest possible date, however, the vote for Lynch’s confirmation as been delayed longer than any other vote for an Attorney General’s confirmation in the past 30 years.
The second reason why Republicans should put aside party lines and vote in Lynch is because she is almost entirely unobjectionable, even to the conservative leadership. Besides her testimony that she believes Obama’s actions regarding immigration are legal, Republicans have found little reason to oppose her. The real source of opposition comes from constituents who would associate a “yes” for Lynch as a “yes” for Obama’s policies.
To hold out for a nonpartisan political nominee, however, is ludicrous. It is unreasonable to expect a president to select an Attorney General who does not agree with him on the issues. Republicans should pull on their legislating pants, bite the bullet and vote in the woman who is most likely their best option anyway.
There are times for pandering to constituents and times for pragmatism, and Loretta Lynch’s confirmation vote falls firmly in the second camp.
