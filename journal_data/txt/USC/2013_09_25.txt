USC baseball announced Wednesday that the team will be partaking in two fall scrimmages this November with the University of San Diego and Long Beach State.

The Trojans will welcome USD to Dedeaux Field on Sunday, Nov. 17, and will travel south to play Long Beach State at their home stadium, Blair Field, the following weekend on Saturday, Nov. 23. Last season, USC defeated Long Beach State 4-1, but did not take on the Toreros.
USD went 37-25 last season winning the West Coast Conference title and making it all the way to the NCAA Regionals before falling to Cal Poly and UCLA. Long Beach State finished 2013 with a 29-27 mark that gave them their third consecutive winning season under head coach Troy Buckley, who will enter his fourth season with the 49ers in 2014.
USC looks to improve on a below .500, 20-36 overall and 10-20 Pac-12 record in 2013, which culminated with USC losing five of its last six games while being swept by crosstown rival and eventual NCAA champion UCLA. The Trojans did not qualify for postseason play.
Second-year head coach Dan Hubbs returns 27 players from last year’s team, including the entire 2013 weekend rotation, which boasts senior left hander Bob Wheatley, junior righty Wyatt Strahan and sophomore lefty Kyle Twomey.
Junior infielder Dante Flores should be able to improve the Trojans’ offensive output as he returns from injury, while outfielders Timmy Robinson and Vahn Bozoian all look to contribute to the cause in their sophomore seasons after successful freshman campaigns.
The team also welcomes 15 new players, including a three-time Team USA alum in freshman Jeremy Martinez, and freshman infielder and pitcher Jeff Paschke, who was named the fifth-best hitting prospect in the 2013 California Collegiate Summer League.

Technically, every game counts.
And technically, USC has already started its conference schedule (and is 0-1).
But the preseason is over.
This, of course, is a lie. There is no preseason in college football. Week one is week one, and the games all count just the same in the annals of history.
But still … the preseason is over.
Conference games are all about familiarity. You know your opponent. Your opponent knows you. You can remember the last however many seasons and all of your games against this team, and these players, and this coaching staff. You remember the hotel you stayed at and the locker you used.
When sophomore defensive lineman Leonard Williams lines up against the Sun Devils this Saturday, he’ll probably remember he had his only career interception against them last year. Same goes for junior linebacker Lamar Dawson. Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee might remember ASU as the squad that handed him his first ever loss as a Trojan: a tremendously lackluster 43-22 defeat that featured four USC turnovers.
The same cannot be said of any of the Trojans first four games. USC has actually played Hawai’i three times in the last four seasons — more than they’ve played Washington State — but still, Hawai’i doesn’t have the intensity of a true conference game. Neither does Washington State, despite the fact that the Trojans lost, and it actually was a conference game.
Arizona State is a different story. The Trojans have played the Sun Devils in each of the last 18 years, and this will make it 19. That level of familiarity breeds an intensity that simply cannot be achieved in a nonconference game. And that intensity hasn’t boded well for the Trojans in recent years. USC has lost its Pac-12 road opener in four of the last five seasons (the lone win being at Washington State in 2010, which in the past would warrant a joke about how that doesn’t really count), and this will be the Trojans first true road test of the year — and one of the toughest, as Sun Devil Stadium is notoriously rowdy.
Plus, it’s a night game, which is conducive to even rowdier fans, and a young offensive line that starts two underclassman on the left side, and you can see how this will be a different sort of beast for the Trojans. For redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, this will be his first try at managing offensive communication — the huddle, audible,  snap count — with some real noise to deal with.
“I remember playing there two years ago. It was a very hostile environment,” said Kessler, who redshirted that season but made the trip with the team. “I enjoyed that. You like getting up for big games like that.”
Of course, Kessler went on to say that there is nothing particularly special about a Pac-12 game, and that it’s “just another opportunity for us.”
Look, I get that. Every game counts and part of any team’s M.O. is not getting too amped for any one particular contest — keep the focus internal. But if the Trojans step on to the field at Sun Devil Stadium and treat it like Hawai’i … Well, I don’t think I need to explain what will probably happen. And neither does junior cornerback Josh Shaw.
“Some people may say it’s not [more intense],” said Shaw of conference play. “But you can just walk in to practice and tell. The crowd noise is pumping. This is a Pac-12 game.”
Now Utah State is a good team, no doubt. People seem to forget they won 11 games last year, and their two losses came by a total of five points. Hell, it’s conceivable that the Aggies are better than the Sun Devils. But the reality is this: Saturday’s contest will be the toughest of the season so far for this Trojan team, who haven’t exactly looked stellar in their previous ones.
Regardless of the opponent, or even the venue, this is a Pac-12 conference game. USC is 0-1 so far.

With the Trojans’ offense facing a litany of depth and injury issues while looking stagnant in most of USC’s games so far, the defense will be called upon to step up to the plate once more as they take on Arizona State this Saturday.
Homecoming · Senior defensive end Devon Kennard, a native of Phoenix, Ariz., will be playing in front of family and friends in Tempe. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
This is the second road game for USC as well as its second conference game. This matchup will determine whether the Trojans or the Sun Devils will start 0-2 in the Pac-12, a surprising development since both squads were expected to compete for the Pac-12 South division title. The Trojans are determined not to be the team to disappoint this weekend.
“We really want this win,” redshirt junior cornerback Josh Shaw said. “We’re going to come out in the first quarter and punch them in the mouth.”
After three home games in a row, the Trojans offense has looked subpar, especially experiencing trouble with third down conversions (27.5 percent success rate).
But the defense has been there to pick up the pieces, only allowing USC’s opponents to convert on 29 percent of their third down chances.
“They practice nasty, they play nasty and they lead by example,” head coach Lane Kiffin said.
The Trojans’ defense has focused on continuing to progress despite the performance of their offensive counterparts.
Team captain and senior defensive end Devon Kennard said the Trojans offense has not affected the way the defense performs or prepares.
“Our goal is to go three and out, get a turnover, get a sack,” Kennard said. “The offense does not directly affect us in the way we play.”
Both the defense and the offense will have to be at their best come Saturday after having played three games in a row at home — Sun Devil Stadium is arguably one of the most hostile atmospheres the Trojans will experience all season.
Kiffin has been using a simulated clapping device broadcast over the loud speakers and loud music at practice this week to prepare the team for the noise level at Sun Devil Stadium.
“I think it’s been preparing us, but nothing is like being in that stadium,” Kennard said. “It’s crazy how loud it gets there.”
The possibility of poor weather — something the Trojans rarely have to worry about while playing at home in Los Angeles — is also fresh on Kiffin’s mind. Two years ago, USC was beat down 43-22 by Arizona State as former quarterback Matt Barkley struggled to throw in windy conditions.
“I remember that crazy dust storm that hit late in the first quarter,” Kiffin said jokingly when asked if he remembered any specific moments from the last time the team visited Tempe. “First it was hot, then it was really cold, and then it was extremely windy and dusty.”
homeward bound
For Kennard, this week’s matchup might just be like playing at home. Kennard is a native to Phoenix, Ariz., which is just a 20 minute car ride from Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe.
“I have about 15 tickets, meaning my entire family will be there,” Kennard said. “Plus I just have a lot of friends that go to Arizona State, so I’m really looking forward to this game.”
from keeton to Kelly
In last week’s matchup against Utah State, the Trojans defense was put to the challenge of containing dual-threat quarterback Chuckie Keeton. Keeton was stifled for much of the game, rushing for minus-15 yards and being sacked four times.
Now the Trojans must prepare for another week of up-tempo offense led by ASU quarterback Taylor Kelly, who is known for his precision passing from the pocket. Kelly ranks 10th nationally in total offense, averaging 354.7 yards a game. He has thrown eight touchdowns with three interceptions in 2013.
“All we have to do is play as a unit, communicate and tackle well,” senior safety Demetrius Wright said.
The veteran said the team is watching a lot of film and observing the tendencies of the Sun Devils’ offensive line.
Kelly is not the only player the Trojans will have to look out for. The Sun Devils have talent on both sides of the ball with defensive tackle Will Sutton rounding out the Sun Devils defense. Sutton received 2012 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year honors.
turning over a new leaf
“About the only thing we haven’t done well on defense in the last two weeks is get turnovers,” Kiffin said.
The Trojans’ defense has made headlines for their consistent performance over the last four games, but they haven’t intercepted any passes in USC’s last two games after recording six picks in the first two games against Hawai’i and Washington State.
“We had a mediocre practice yesterday so the focus has been on making plays on the ball,” said defensive lineman George Uko. “Not just making the tackle, but actually putting an emphasis on where the ball is and getting the ball out.”

The USC women’s volleyball team entered Wednesday night’s home match surrounded with the usual hype that accompanies their matches against UCLA. But in defeating the Bruins, the Women of Troy sent a message to both their crosstown rivals and the entire Pac-12 conference that they’re a force to be reckoned with this season.
Good first impression · Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwabenu was a force in her first Pac-12 game, registering a team-high 17 kills, including six in the final set to help clinch the win for the Women of Troy. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy opened conference play with a bang, defeating the Bruins 3-1 (25-23, 25-22, 21-25, 25-16) in a matchup between Los Angeles rivals and two of the Pac-12’s premier heavyweights.
“We’ve been trying to attack our opponents in the middle and we were able to give them some serious problems there,” head coach Mick Haley said. “We passed very well tonight and they were serving us tough, but when they served us short we are able to strike back and hit the ball quickly.”
The first set saw both teams trade points back and forth as expected, playing to a 17-all tie. A block by senior outside hitter Sara Shaw and a UCLA attacking error put USC in front 20-18. The Bruins rallied to tie it at 21, but a kill by junior Emily Young and an attacking error gave the Women of Troy the first set, 25-23.
UCLA took control early of the second set to start 6-3, but senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard and Young finished off a sequence of strong plays to tie the score at 7-7. The teams stayed close until freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu knocked down a tremendous strike to increase the lead to 24-21, and another Bruin error sealed the set 25-22.
The teams played to a 9-9 standstill to open the third set, but the Women of Troy rattled off four straight points, culminating in an Nwanebu kill, to jump in front 13-9 and force a UCLA timeout. Fighting for their lives, the Bruins mounted considerable pressure to tie the frame at 18-all and then take the lead 19-18. Nwanebu restored the tie with a left-side strike, but the Bruins stormed back to lead 23-20 and triumphed 25-21 on a kill by outside hitter Haley Lawless.  The Women of Troy committed eight errors in the third set, more than the first two sets combined.
The Women of Troy jumped out in front 9-6 to start the fourth set and an Nwanebu kill extended it to 14-10. The Women of Troy dominated from there, at one point increasing their lead to 10 before Shaw ended the match at 25-16 with her seventh kill.
Turning Point
After allowing UCLA to pull to within 12-10 in the fourth set, USC took matters into its own hands, reeling off six consecutive points to go up 18-10. They never looked back after that, leading by as much as 10 before wrapping up their 11th victory of the season.
Unsung Hero
Junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer saw action in each of the four sets and solidified the middle for USC, recording seven kills and attacking at a team-high clip of .583. The Arcadia, Calif. native also assisted on two blocks to finish the night with 9 points.
Best Quote
“I think we all came out focused and ready to go, which is important throughout the season because everyone’s good in the Pac-12,” Olgard said. “We prepared very well and had a quiet intensity about us.”
What Worked
The Women of Troy put forth one of their best serving performances of the season, knocking down six aces.
“I think that’s the best we’ve served the Bruins, maybe even since we’ve been here,” Haley said. “I think we caused them some serious trouble, because normally we don’t serve them so tough.”
What Didn’t Work
The Women of Troy triumphed despite a flurry of hitting errors in the latter half of the match. Haley was particularly unhappy about the five errors in the fourth set despite a nine-point victory and highlighted the errors as one of the focuses of improvement going forward.
The Women of Troy will have the rest of the week off before they travel to Salt Lake City to take on Utah Sunday afternoon.

Students at American University in Dubai can now take an Introduction to Interactive Entertainment course offered by the USC School of Cinematic Arts.
Using Cisco TelePresence 3210 Global Classroom technology, 19 students in AUD’s Mohammed Bin Rashid School for Communication are currently enrolled in a virtual lecture experience. TelePresence is high-definition audiovisual conference technology that links two physically separate rooms into a single conference room.
According to AUD, the TelePresence technology was introduced in 2011 as part of a collaboration between Cisco and The Mohammed Bin Rashid School for Communication and is the first global classroom in the Arab world.
AUD Students can communicate with USC Assistant Professor of the Practice William Huber via a three-screen plasma display in the university’s Student Center. The class examines the origins of video games and aims to help students critically analyze gaming and the evolution of the player/video game relationship.
Huber said he can develop a close relationship with his students in Dubai because the technology the classroom uses allows him to see their faces and read their expressions more than he would be able to in a typical lecture setting.
“Where I teach at USC, I stand on a stage, and I feel more remote,” Huber told Emirates News Agency. “TelePresence does have a feeling of a seminar, I feel I can look at the students directly and see exactly what they are doing.”

The USC Alternative Break Program has added a summer trip to Uganda as one of its 16 planned destinations. The program is also planning trips to both India and Thailand for this upcoming winter break.
The program, founded in 1992, allows USC students to engage in volunteer and community service work during their winter, spring or summer breaks.
The trips are both international and domestic, sending students to destinations such as Guatemala, Thailand and the Navajo Nation in Utah. Students engage in a variety of volunteer work, ranging from building libraries to working with orphans.
Since the program’s inception, Alternative Break has grown immensely. In the past year alone, three trips have been added, according to Program Manager Joenique Rose.
“I can tell that they have grown in popularity,” said Rose, who has been with the program since 2008. “That’s why we keep adding more trips. Because, we see that students want to go. Students really want this opportunity.”
Rose said that the Alternative Break Program is perfect for those students who otherwise wouldn’t have the chance to engage in a study abroad experience.
“It gives students the opportunity to go abroad and do service at the same time,” Rose said.
The trips are led by a series of student coordinators who organize the majority of the trips’ logistics.
“It’s a very student-centered, student-run department on campus,” Rose said.
One of the student coordinators for the Thailand trip, Nicole Talion, a senior majoring in international relations (global business), said the program allows students to enrich their college experience.
“It’s an experience that takes you out of yourself,” Talion said. “I know in the USC bubble you can get so caught up in your own life and your own aspirations, but just taking the time out to go on this trip and really serve and see what life is like in these other countries helps you put things in perspective.”
David Mandell, a junior majoring in theater and a student coordinator for the India trip, saw this program as a unique opportunity to learn both about himself and other cultures.
“It’s definitely a spiritual journey,” Mandell said. “Its one of the most incredible experiences I could have asked for. Not only are you traveling and making a family with USC students, you get to appreciate more of what you already have.”
Stephanie Moon, a senior majoring in English and a student coordinator, echoed these sentiments.
“The alternative breaks are amazing experiences. I think the winter break program is great for students who want to see different parts of the world but don’t want to commit to a full study abroad,” Moon said.
This winter break will be the second year for the India trip, and those going hope to contribute even more to the same community they visited last year. One of their main focuses this time around will be empowering the women in the local community.
“We wanted to be more involved in the women’s center, teaching English and how to start sustainable businesses,” Moon said. “We hope by commercializing their efforts, they will be able to develop a limited financial economy and generate income and show their usefulness to their families.”
Moon believes that all students should try to take advantage of this unique experience.
“The winter trip in particular allows students to enter this space where they really are separated from being students and when they come back they can take everything they’ve learned and transform it in a way that benefits the community back here,” she said.

A mounted display, directional 3-D audio, and vibrations act in concert to immerse a man clutching a game controller through a virtual Middle East. His avatar is riding a Humvee, part of a convoy, when an IED suddenly and abruptly explodes up ahead. His virtual comrades erupt into commotion.
This isn’t a video game setup showcasing the newest installment in the Call of Duty series. It’s a therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder being developed by researchers at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies.
The treatment, known as Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy, allows veterans with PTSD to confront traumatic war memories. In ICT’s Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan program, patients can explore various scenarios in settings reminiscent of Middle Eastern cities and deserts.
A trained therapist who can manipulate the environment to each patient’s needs guides them through the virtual world. Therapists can adjust weather, add villagers and trigger events with the touch of a button in the game.
As each patient explores the virtual world, he or she communicates with the therapist in order to work through the emotions and physiological effects being experienced.
Exposure therapy is a common form of behavior treatment used to treat many anxiety disorders. In this type of therapy, the patient learns to gradually confront the fears, anxieties and situations at the root of his or her disorder.
Though exposure therapy can be used to treat certain disorders by directly exposing the patient to the actual trigger or feared situation, this isn’t possible with PTSD for war veterans where the underlying trigger is a painful memory from the war.
Historically, exposure therapy for these cases is conducted through guided visualization, which relies on the patient imagining and recreating memories and feelings. With virtual reality, however, therapists can directly place patients in immersive environments that elicit a physiological response as if they were actually in the environment.
“We can go back and look at log files and know exactly what the patient saw in the simulation,” said Albert “Skip” Rizzo, the associate director and research lead for Medical Virtual Reality at ICT.
Exposure therapy is not a new science, but technological innovations have allowed for significant advances in the treatment.
“The use of technology by this generation is not a luxury, it’s a given. As long as you’re delivering evidence-based treatment, then the technology can make it more effective, more efficient, more trackable,” Rizzo said.
The technology is also becoming cheaper as advanced gaming hardware becomes more widespread. Rizzo said the hardware for the program costs less than $5,000.
Aside from using virtual reality to treat veterans with PTSD through exposure therapy, Rizzo is also working on using virtual reality to prepare servicemen and women who have yet to be deployed.
“We put ourselves out of that job by doing a better job on the front end so that we can reduce the ultimate incidence of PTSD,” Rizzo said. “Now, I don’t think we can eliminate it completely, but if we can cut it in half that would be a great thing.”
Technology and virtual reality is an emerging aspect of USC School of Social Work’s military social work subconcentration, which is using other virtual reality technologies in partnership with ICT to train future clinicians who have to interact with veterans.
One example of this is the “Virtual Patient” — a simulation program designed to replicate the behavior of war veterans that were exposed to combat stress. In this application of virtual reality in the clinical setting, students role-play with the “patient,” Staff Sergeant Alamar Castilla, an avatar programmed to emulate the symptoms of a number of conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress.
“It’s great for veterans and civilians. From the veteran perspective, it teaches me how to handle countertransference and set clinical boundaries,” said Marc Rentaria, a graduate student in his concentration year of the Master of Social Work program.
Rentaria himself is a veteran of the U.S. Army who has been deployed three times.
Some students worried, though, that the program could over generalize the conditions of patients.
“Nothing compares to a living, breathing veteran in front of you because there is no one, single veteran,” said Tien Quach, an Army Reserve and a student in the master of social work program. “There is that particular veteran. But I do like the fact that there is a lot of research into it because you have to start somewhere.”

With WikiLeaks, hacktivism and Internet espionage on the rise, USC’s Center for International Studies hosted Peter Dombrowski, professor of strategic research at the U.S. Naval War College, to elaborate on the issue of cyberwarfare and “cybered conflict,” the Internet-based aspects of international conflict.
Virtual reality · Professor Peter Dombrowski debates the role of the web in a globalized world on Wednesday in the Social Sciences Building. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The talk, titled “Cyber War, Cybered conflict and the International System” dealt with the definition of cyberwarfare and the debate surrounding it.
One of Dombrowski’s main points was that the organized aspect of cyberspace makes it a place of property and regulation, as opposed to the chaos that characterizes some domains of previous wars, such as air space.
“People are trying to get a grip on what cyberspace is,” Dombrowski said. “It’s a foundation. It’s a baseline where activities take place. You can’t separate it out as a domain. It’s a built environment.”
Dombrowski said that cyber weaponry and cybered conflict existed as soon as the Internet was invented. As the Internet continued to expand, phishing scams and malware illustrated that it was possible to use the Internet as a weapon. Many people were worried about the implications this had for the future of the Internet.
“People are going to find a way to use this to wage war,” Dombrowski said.
A cyber war could be more important than many students think.
“If there’s no casualties, how can it be warfare?” Dombrowski asked attendees.
Dombrowski cited Stuxnet, the virus that took down the Iranian power plant in June 2010, as an example of how powerful the Internet can be.
“Imagine if those centrifuges had … exploded with all those technicians around,” he said.
Dombrowski believes that cyberspace will be a part of every war in the future.
“Because cyberspace is essential to modern society, there is now the case where no dimension of conflict or warfare remains untouched by cyberspace,” Dombrowski said. “We think cyberspace plays a role in all phases of conflict … whether it’s using networks to shut down defense systems to make a physical attack … or whether you’re trying to show what the outside world sees, like Egypt, shutting down the internet … it’s a part of conflict.”
Dombrowski said that cyberspace and sovereign space will inevitably combine and become indispensible to each other. Even the term “cybered conflict” will one day be obsolete.
“Five years from now, 10 years from now, every type of conflict will have this [cyber] dimension,” he said.
Many students said they were relatively uninformed about the subject of cyberwarfare.
Phoebe Tang, a second-year graduate student studying political science and international relations, said that her knowledge of the topic was very limited.
“It’s not a traditional sphere that we’ve been covering so far because we have been trained critically in the traditional theoretical perspectives,” Tang said. “I just want to look for different perspectives to explain this phenomenon or whether the traditional perspectives may work.”
Other students were concerned with specific aspects of cyberwarfare, such as storage issues.
“Recently the U.S. government put the CIA on the cloud,” said Matthew Sprott, a junior majoring in critical studies. “With everything on clouds, cyberwarfare is going to be more prevalent.”
Thomas Armstrong, a junior majoring in history and international relations, wondered how the issue of cyberwarfare was pertinent to the United States’ relations with other foreign countries.
“The big conflict that we always hear about is U.S. and China,” Armstrong said. “I’d love to hear more about what the government is doing to counter Chinese hackers and the types of ability our government has.”
Many believe the United States’ take on cyberwarfare will continue to evolve.
“I think the most important issue is the struggle of how to define cybered conflict. And how we define it has a real impact on how our government corporations prepare with our offensive and defensive strategies,” Sprott said.

No Budget Film Festival
4473 Sunset Dr.
Sept. 28, 6:00 p.m.
There’s no such thing as a movie made for free, but the contestants of the Fourth Annual No Budget Film Festival are definitely trying their best with what little they have. Film buffs will appreciate the brilliance that can be made from the artistic constraints of the no-budget short film. A $10 ticket should buy a lot more fun than watching the USC football team on offense.
Thai Food Festival Los Angeles
5555 Melrose Ave.
Sept. 29, 3:30 p.m.
Is it pricey? Yes. Is it neon orange-colored noodles in a styrofoam box at 3 a.m.? No. Check out the first ever L.A. Thai Food Festival this weekend at the Paramount Theatre. Throw some elbows at the Muay Thai demo and definitely try the food: Chef Sang Yoon of Lukshon and Pok Pok’s Andy Ricker will be whipping up their renditions of some Thai favorites, and L.A. Thai food powerhouse Jitlada will be serving up regional dishes at this cuisine-centered event. Thai food fans unite! Weak stomachs and the flavor-shy need not apply.
Stair Climb for 
Los Angeles
401 South Hope St.
Sept. 27, 11:00 a.m.
Ditch the stairmaster this weekend: The YMCA is hosting a stair climb up the famous U.S. Bank Tower to benefit the Ketchum-Downtown Los Angeles YMCA. Ascend the tallest building west of the Mississippi River and take in a fantastic view of the greater Los Angeles area from the tower’s roof. For those who lack the requisite self-hatred for a stair climb of death, Hope Street will also be shut down and converted into a massive block party featuring live musical performances and food trucks. But seriously, don’t be “that guy” who takes the elevator for a measly 75 floors.
Dodgers vs. Rockies 
1000 Elysian Park Ave.
Sept. 28, 6:10 p.m.
The Dodgers have clinched the playoff spot, but that doesn’t mean they’re giving up on giving away free stuff. Saturday’s promotional item is a Dodger Snuggie. Also, this weekend marks the last chance to take that pretty girl to the ballgame without liquidating your assets for playoff tickets, so mark your calendars and watch the Boys in Blue rock the Colorado Rockies!

Remember that scene from Dr. Dolittle 2 when the animal whisperer takes away his daughter’s cell phone? Probably not.
It’s all I remember from the movie, starring Eddie Murphy as the doctor and Raven Symoné as his daughter, Charisse. After Dr. Dolittle snatches the antiquated-looking cell phone, Charisse responds with a sharp retort: “What am I supposed to do without my cell phone?”
Writing out that line doesn’t do justice to Raven’s delivery. There’s quite a bit of emphasis on the words “cell phone.” But don’t fear, you can see it in all its glory on YouTube.
It was 2001. And the scene stuck with me so vividly because my brother, some friends and I used to repeat the line mockingly. How bratty the statement sounded then.
The film predated the iPhone by a good six years. And truth be told, the greatest noncommunication accessory that cell phones had going for them was the game Snake, which truly was (and remains) great. Back then, more often than not, the answer to, “What am I supposed to do without my cell phone?” might simply be: use the house phone.
But the rhetorical question today hardly sounds bratty. In fact, it’s unfortunately something I find myself asking all the time. What am I supposed to do without my cell phone?
Sorry, did I just write cell phone? I meant smartphone.
Whether I’m walking to class, exercising at the gym or driving (yes, even driving), this fear seems to surface. I meticulously calculate the time before my phone abruptly turns into the depressing black screen of energy lost. If I play one more song, I should be OK until the end of my workout. Heaven forbid my phone does in fact die and I’m left asking: “What am I supposed to do without my cell phone?”
Again, I meant smartphone. And it is smart. It is very smart.
This, of course, explains one reason why I’m inseparable from my phone. It does everything for me, from tasks as basic as checking email to jobs as complicated as depositing checks.
Another reason that I rarely let my cell phone go to black is that, to some extent, I feel expected to always be on the grid. In today’s world, people must be reachable and reachable quickly. It doesn’t necessarily matter if you are at work, at the movies or in bed.
No, that was not a typo. In fact, according to the 2013 Mobile Consumer Habits study, 9 percent of American smart phone users reported having used their mobile devices during sex. According to the same survey, 12 percent said they’ve used smart phones in the shower and 55 percent have used their devices while driving, which I suppose is unfortunately no surprise.
Communication can’t wait, when it comes to the smart phone. And in today’s world, Raven’s “What am I supposed to do without my cell phone?” doesn’t seem bratty at all.
Still, there is a more pernicious reason why I can’t live without my iPhone 4s, iOS 6 (I’ve held out on the update). In an interview with Conan O’Brien last week, comedian Louis C.K. accurately described this problem in a video that went viral.
On driving while using your phone, he says, “People are willing to risk taking a life and ruining their own because they don’t want to be alone for a second.”
The interview is worth watching in full, but the primary reason he doesn’t want his children to have phones is summed up with one line at the end of the interview.
“You never feel completely sad or completely happy, you just feel kinda satisfied with your product. And then you die,” he told O’Brien.
We use our smart phones, according to Louie C.K., to conceal the nervousness that comes with being alone.
It’s hard not to agree with this bleak take, at least to some degree. We’ve all seen it. When at dinner for two and left alone, even for a split second, one’s first reaction is to go for the cell phone. I’m just as guilty as anyone else. Instead of using the time to wait patiently and think, my knee-jerk reaction is to check Facebook (even though I don’t really have to) or Twitter (even though I don’t really have to).
Don’t get me wrong, smartphones are remarkable and have dramatically changed communication, mostly for the better. Still, that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t benefit from using them a bit more judiciously. There are still things that should be done without a cell phone — such as thinking and feeling.
The phone line that Symoné uses in Dr. Dolittle 2, perhaps the question, “What am I supposed to do without my cell phone?” is outdated. Instead, we might benefit from asking “what am I supposed to do with my cell phone?”

After taking a three-year long hiatus, Kings of Leon return to the studio with Mechanical Bull, a remarkably fresh and youthful sounding rock album. The spry, energetic sound is in contrast to some of the band’s far more grown-up issues.

Drawing on sounds and vibes from their earlier work, the sixth studio album from the Tennessee natives is raw and energetic, yet musically complex. In true KOL fashion, the lyrics are poetic and at times deceptively simple. Listened to as a whole, the album plays fluidly, striking a perfect balance between the numbers of upbeat tracks and ballads. And even though the Followill boys had some unsteady moments during their last tour, these kings are back and ready to continue their reign.
The three brothers and cousin return to their roots on this album, mixing the sounds of their first two albums, Youth and Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak, with hints of the beachy chimes from Come Around Sundown, their fifth album. The album encompasses the same mesh of blues, soul and Southern rock that made the band famous.
With a mix of catchy and heartfelt tracks, the album offers up something for every type of fan. The tracks “Supersoaker,” “Temple” and “Family Tree” are upbeat and catchy with potential to become radio singles. The retro music video accompanying “Supersoaker” might have led fans to believe the Kings were swaying towards an experimental album, but the Kings keep it old school on Mechanical Bull, evoking sounds from their first two albums.
In fact, the guitar riffs on “Don’t Matter” and the simple chorus make the track sound like it’s right off Holy Roller Novocain, the band’s first album. Likewise, “Coming Back Again” evokes the same grungy rock that feels like a throwback to the days of the band’s inception, both lyrically and musically.
Intimate slow jams such as “Beautiful War” and “Wait For Me” shed light on the more tender concerns of these Southern rockers while highlighting lead singer Caleb Followill’s husky-yet-velvety voice. “Wait for Me” has radio appeal and will probably drop as the second single. “On the Chin,” a contemplative track, possibly about Caleb’s struggle in leading the band gets fans closer to the inner workings of a world famous rock band questioning their place in the musical landscape.
The slight disappointments on the album are the lackluster deluxe tracks on the special iTunes edition. Though “Work on Me” is up-tempo and echoes the sounds of Come Around Sundown, neither the lyrics nor rhythm play as particularly memorable. Likewise, “Last Mile Home,” the second deluxe track, doesn’t inspire and rides over the listener passively.
Bassist Jared Followill called the album a “culmination” of their previous work, but these Southerners take it a step further than just a compilation of their old sounds. They expand on what they do best — adding in layers of instrumental complexity. For example at the end of track eight, “Comeback Story,” violin strings sweep in as Caleb swoons, “I walk a mile in your shoes / And now I’m a mile away / and I’ve got your shoes.” Paired with a grooving bass line, the resulting sound is richly layered with instrumentation, resulting in a more nuanced and mature sound than the band’s  earlier work.
After a world tour bogged down with rumors that the brothers were embroiled in a feud, the Kings decided to take a hiatus. While Come Around Sundown finally got them on North America’s radar and was a great album with a slight beachy, California vibe, it lacked a counterbalance from more heartfelt, downtempo tracks.
Though Jared was right to label the album a culmination, Mechanical Bull doesn’t sound like a greatest hits album. The album cover, which depicts the album title as a dirty neon sign outside a run-down bar,  captures the overall feel of the album. The songs sound like the score to a grungy night in a small town bar that houses a mechanical bull. Yet instead of simulating an intoxicated ride on the bull, this album keeps you at the bar, sipping and observing the ongoing youthful ruckus.

One of the most popular operas ever, Georges Bizet’s Carmen carries with it the drama, scale and sex appeal befitting to kick off the Los Angeles Opera’s 2013-14 season at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion. To add to its glamour, acclaimed director Placido Domingo was in the pit to conduct on opening night. Yet, in the end, it was not the production’s grandiose scale, but its select intimate moments that made an impact.

The tale of a gypsy and a soldier, Carmen explores the themes of lust, love and freedom. The opera follows Don Jose (played by Brandon Jovanovich), a soldier who gives up his job and his childhood love to pursue Carmen (played by Patricia Bardon), a bohemian fortuneteller who just wants to live a life unencumbered by society. Carmen makes her first appearance on the set barefoot. Last season, before the opening of Cinderella, conductor James Conlon explained that the reason Cinderella would lose a bracelet and not her slipper is because it was once considered scandalous for a woman to show her bare feet on stage. Clearly, Carmen could care less about exposing her feet. Bardon is in control of the role, convincingly commanding attention as she dances, teases and flirts. There is a slightly darker edge to Barton’s Carmen, which is a welcome addition and some character development that would be worthy of exploring even further in later performances.
To the audience, Carmen is an enigma. Her desires, her secrets, her fears are all kept hidden. All that is clear is how much she values her freedom. The rest of her secrets are kept at arm’s length away from the audience and Don Jose. It must be difficult to play a character who feels more like an ideal than a person, but Bardon makes Carmen feel real, delivering an understated yet strong performance. It helps, of course, that she has a familiarity in the role: This is her fourth time playing Carmen, previously with the Welsh National Opera, the Scottish Opera and the Hamburg State Opera.
Her counterpart, Don Jose, has a fieriness to him that comes out more and more throughout the night as he and Carmen fight. It’s hard to feel sorry for him. He gives up everything for a woman he doesn’t know. He allows her to use him. Rather than go to his sick mother, or be faithful to his childhood love, Micaela (played by South African soprano Pretty Yende), he stays put — masochistically, he enjoys that she treats him poorly. Jovanovich comes into his own in the role in the final act. It’s a highly-charged performance and Jovanovich finally lets his anger and lust come through in his voice.
The standout performance of the night, though, belonged to Yende. When she sang her solo in the third act, it was almost as though the audience held its breath until she finished. There always seems to be something heroic about an opera because of its scale and size, and the passion that she brought to the song gave the night that sense.
Ildebrando D’Arcangelo’s brief performance as the glamorous toreador Escamillo was another highlight. D’Arcangelo brought a surprisingly humorous element to the production. He too has his eye on Carmen, and his voice takes on a knowing swagger as he sings and then reprises “Toreador” while he looks for Carmen. Just how hard is it to find a set of thieves hiding on a mountain? Apparently, not very. He finds her easily before he is threatened by Don Jose at swordpoint. But almost immediately after Don Jose leaves, one hears his dulcet tone ring out again: “Toreador.”
Carmen’s sets are staggering. Originally created for the Teatro Real in Madrid, Gerardo Trotti’s vision translates just as well in Downtown Los Angeles. It sets the mood and gives the production a scale. Still, the breadth of the set makes the performances feel removed at times. In total, the show has 280 cast, crew and orchestra members, but the sheer number of people on stage, along with the massive sets, made some of the scenes feel crowded and overwhelming.
There is a lot of excess in this Carmen that could have been trimmed to make the production stronger. The opening night ran long, and the audience did not linger in their seats after the last act. Though the individual performances were powerful, many elements, especially the group songs, felt like they went on unnecessarily long, a sharp contrast to the music in the opera and the plot, which is is so upbeat. A few edits to make the plot focus more on the central characters and less on the background story might have gone a long way here.
Still, the night delivered what it promised: a grandiose world of color, emotion and song. And the music alone is enough, sometimes. The songs in Carmen such as “Habanera,” “Seguidilla” and “Toreador Song” are favorites that almost everyone knows. To hear the L.A. Opera Orchestra play them will have you leaving singing “Toreador.”
 
Carmen runs at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion through Oct. 6.

You do realize that those “group songs” are written in the opera and that you cant just start cutting music  out on a whim so that people can get to their cars faster? It was written this way for because that’s how the composer wanted it. This isn’t a film adaptation of a musical… It’s just not done that way.
If Toreador is not expressive enough (as it often happens) the ecstasy of the crowd and Carmen’s preference of his love to freedom becomes ambigious.  Usually the singers make accent on the Song and later the character loses interest. In reality it is not easy to create the character of the idol of public, as well as to show in the Song the rapture of danger, jf one’s own glory and right for love won by life risk. Ildebrando D”Arcangello is a brilliant Toreador, not only in the Song… but in the scene with Don Jose which is splendidly set in Francesca Zambello’s production (2008). Jose is not humiliated, the characters ate compatible in their appearance, both move splendidly, and both are in the state of animal tension. In the final scene D’Arcangello shows Toreador in his glory – he has everything -glory, adoration, all the city is at his feet, a famous belle near him. surrendering -he is the master of life. This makes more poignant the despair of Jose and makes the finale tragic and pathetic…
 D’Arcangello is the born Toreador (as well as Don Giovanni), and his participation guarantees success to any production of this masterpieces.

Divisions within the Republican Party are threatening to bring the government to the precipice of financial collapse. Based on the vote held in the House of Representatives, the Republican Party’s goal seems to be holding the fiscal debates hostage to cut off funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As Congress careens through this messy fiscal negotiation, a lack of coordination and an absolute absence of cooperation threaten to throw the debates — and America — over the edge of ruin.
Fortunately for the Democrats, divisions are emerging within the Republicans over the best way to defund the ACA. This lack of coordination in the Republican Party might be ultimately beneficial for resolving the fiscal negotiations and preserving the ACA.  The absence of a coordinated opposition to the ACA will have far-reaching political consequences for the GOP: It will portray them as a divided party, willing to put the nation’s economic recovery at risk to halt a singular law.
Though cooperation between both parties is usually necessary for passing legislation in such a divided government, the GOP’s failure to coordinate will actually help make a solution to the government shutdown possible. The GOP is a house divided: it might be bad for them, but in this case, that is good for the U.S.
After a bill from the House to defund the ACA and maintain the present levels of government funding passed on a party-line vote, the Senate took up the measure. Referring to the bill as “dead on arrival,” Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.) swore that a bill would return to the House at the end of the week that removed the ACA-stripping language, forcing House Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the House Republicans to either shut down the government, or accept it.
According to the Washington Post, even as the bill arrived from the House, some GOP Senators were plotting to delay its transfer back to the House, drawing fire from minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Arizona Senator John McCain.
When a procedural vote to consider the bill came up, Tea Party darling Ted Cruz (R-Texas) delivered the fourth-longest speech in Senate history, holding the floor for just over 21 hours in an attempt to block debate, according to NBC News. At the conclusion of his speech, the Senate promptly voted 100-0 to bring the bill up for consideration.
Antics such as Cruz’s filibuster actually increase the chances of resolving the government shutdown. According to CBS News, the House will not get the bill back until at least Sunday because of the time necessary to debate and amend the legislation. This will leave Boehner just hours to avoid a government shutdown, and no time to send a different bill to the Senate. Given that a shutdown would be disastrous for the GOP’s approval ratings — as they would be the party last holding the bag — most indicators point to them sending the Senate bill (with the ACA intact) to President Barack Obama’s desk.
Coordination within the GOP is necessary to preserve the party as a functioning, cohesive unit. The time and place to make a case for repealing the ACA will come in the spring, when the sequestration cuts are revisited. At that time, Republicans can easily make the case for more affordable health care, in conjunction with fixing the arbitrary cuts levied by the sequester.
Every day spent haggling over the ACA now only takes away from the GOP’s credibility to attack the law at a time that actually makes sense. More importantly, preserving credibility for the spring term will enable real discussions between the Democrats and the Republicans on the future of the law. If the present trend is any indication, however, the Democrats might have the last laugh.

I think the real story should be Obama and his Socialist Policies are going to shut down Companies. Obama Care is just more Gov Control. You cannot name me One Gov Program that is run more efficiently then the Private Sector. The problem is to many young people fail to educate yourselves, you are being  taught by a Network of people making living off the system. This Information you have posted is why our Country is in Decline. Thanks
One of the disturbing comments I often heard when it came to the recent bankruptcy of Detroit was that this didn’t happen overnight and that it was decades in the making. Although some of the examples may differ, we are looking at the decline of US and slowly following the failed states we have seen in Greece and Europe.
There is no such thing as free or even affordable healthcare. The only thing Obamacare is doing is redistributing who will pay more and who will continue to expect the govt to take care of them.
This is like so many of Obama’s socialistic, redistributing tendencies. Think about it – how does signing a piece of paper magically make healthcare affordable for all? It doesn’t! It just eventually makes the cost of healthcare fall even more heavily on people who work hard and pay their fair share – then these same people are accused of not paying their fair share while millions continue to sponge off these same people. 
When I see Los Angeles, 20, 30 years from now – it is headed in the Detroit trajectory. I am afraid much of the country is also following suit.
“a shutdown would be disastrous for…” This is a debatable conclusion. For a party that is wary of government and a citizenry that is threatened by the TSA, NSA, ect., shutting down the beast is not a PR problem. Remember that a “shutdown” will pause the “non-essential” functions of the government. 
A shutdown could be the fastest track to finding out which functions of the government are a waste of money and a return to reasonable budget debates and practices.

On Sept. 20, 16-year-old Cassidy Lynn Campbell was crowned homecoming queen at Marina High School in Huntington Beach. Unlike many homecoming queens, however, Campbell is transgender, and according to the Huffington Post, is only the second transgender woman to be voted homecoming queen of an educational institution in the United States. Though this is an obvious indicator of the United States’ path to equality and socially conscious thinking, there is still much to be done for transgender equality.
Arnav Garg | Daily Trojan
Campbell’s homecoming queen crowning follows the recent passing of California Gov. Jerry Brown’s controversial bill to allow transgender students in public schools to participate in sex-segregated programs and facilities in line with their self-perceived gender.
Campbell, born male as Lance Campbell, has been living as a woman for the past three years. Campbell was quoted as saying she has “always felt trapped in the wrong body.”
Campbell has certainly made progress in the grand scheme of things. Her win made headlines on major news outlets such as People magazine, the Los Angeles Times and the Huffington Post, and she was approached by MTV with the prospect of doing her own show.
But it is deeply disheartening that in such a progressive generation for the LGBTQ community, assimilation into society for transgender people continues to be remarkably slow. Transgender teen Kasey Caron, for example, has been forbidden from running for his high school’s homecoming king, despite the teen identifying as male, according to the Daily Mail.
High school is already a time when most students are facing crises in their own self-esteem and identity. It is both cruel and inhumane for any school to put their students through this type of treatment.
So what is to be done?
Though there is no cut and dry solution for solving any issue of transgender inequality, there are steps that can and must be taken immediately to cease unnecessary suffering for the transgender community. These ideas of change will focus on the younger generations.
First and foremost, this change needs to come within the public school system. Transgender students are subject to the highest risks of bullying and harassment from fellow students. If students can’t feel safe within their own schools, where can they? The longer the issue of transgender equality is ignored, the more it is reinforced to these young people that it is not acceptable to simply be themselves.
These young men and women could be the future leaders of our nation. Sending a message to them  that their identity is not acceptable is dangerous for current and future generations alike. It is downright irresponsible for government legislation not to step up and take control.
Second, change needs to come through the media. Though some television outlets have included gay and lesbian characters, the integrating of transgender characters within movies and TV shows would be highly beneficial to the self-esteem of these young people everywhere. Though these characters would be fictional, this representation would reinforce the acceptance for the transgender community within society as a whole, an acceptance these young people so desperately need and deserve.
Third, more efforts need to be made to integrate the transgender community. Such efforts would entail building gender-neutral restrooms in all public areas, as well as gender-neutral changing rooms in clothing stores. The USC community is already making strides in this effort by including gender-neutral restrooms in many academic buildings.
Though these attempts might seem small individually, together they hold great power in increasing acceptance of the transgender community.
Flip through any history book and the same lesson will be repeated: Segregating any community of people leads to a catastrophic result.

If i was biologically born a white person, but felt deep inside I was a black person, would it be acceptable for me to undergo a series of surgeries and chemical treatments to cosmetically turn me into a black person? If we are saying all bets off when it comes to what we are when we are born, then why is this only pertaining to gender and why not to ethnicity and race? If one criticizes this position then obviously they are being insensitive and intolerant towards my inner need to be a black person.
