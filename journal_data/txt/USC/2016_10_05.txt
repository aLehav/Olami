Heather Gray | Daily Trojan
Judge James Gray, the former vice presidential candidate for Gov. Gary Johnson’s failed 2012 presidential campaign, came to speak to USC students about the United States’ failed drug policies, as well as the consequences of the drug war in America in Waite Phillips Hall Wednesday at 7 p.m. Hosted by the Young Americans for Liberty, Gray is the first speaker in a series that will be presented by the USC club. 
Gray, a libertarian, graduated from USC’s Gould School of Law in 1971, then served in the Peace Corps and in the Naval JAG. He now presides as a judge for the Superior Court of Orange County in California. Gray has been speaking publicly about the errors in the United States’ drug policies for years. He published a book, Why Our Drug Laws Have Failed and What We Can Do About It: A Judicial Indictment of the War on Drugs, on the subject in 2001.
Chad Lonski, the president of Young Americans for Liberty and a writer for the Daily Trojan, spoke on why this discussion was important for USC students to hear, especially as it touched on numerous issues relevant to the upcoming election.
“I think a lot of students want to get over this hurdle of poor drug policy,” Lonski said. “At least with California and the marijuana laws that will be coming up on the next election, it’s gonna be a very controversial issue, especially in young liberal-minded students.” 
Gray explained how the issues the United States has with drugs is less with drug users and more with drug money that is involved — the main driving factor of the ongoing drug war. 
Gray supports regulating drugs for quality control, as well as cutting money off from illegal groups that profit off of drugs. 
“We’re ruining a lot of people’s lives in a way, taking a lot of parents away from their children, filling up our jails, taking a whole lot of resources that could better be spent elsewhere,” Gray said.
Gray further detailed how the government is focusing on criminalizing drugs when instead they should be taxed and regulated, much like tobacco and alcohol currently are. 
“I think any time you impose boundaries on people’s personal lives, there will be issues, and obviously that is reflected in the drug war. Marijuana should definitely be regulated,” said Bella Estrada, a junior majoring in history who agreed with Gray’s stance on U.S. drug policies.
Gray encouraged all eligible voters to support Proposition 64, the Marijuana Legalization Initiative, as it will start the process of rectifying California’s drug policies. 
“One thing you can do is vote in favor of Prop 64,” Gray said. “If California goes away from drug prohibition, if they were to go for regulated marijuana, the federal government will have to start changing policy.”

David Kaye, United Nations special rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression and opinion, addressed ways to combat the infringement of digital rights in a speech titled the “Challenges to Freedom of Expression in a Digital Age.”
The speech kicked off a human rights speaker series sponsored by the Price School of Public Policy and the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Both school representatives in attendance stressed the importance of discussing human rights on USC’s campus. 
“We’re focused on improving the lives of people here in our community, but also in the world,” said Donnajean Ward, executive director in the Office of the Dean at Price. “Human rights are issues that are not just global issues, but also local issues.”
 Kaye, who currently teaches at the UC Irvine School of Law, has discussed freedom of expression in many countries throughout the world. The cornerstone of his talk was on digital rights, based off of Article 19, which provides broad freedom of expression in every digital frontier. 
For the first part of the talk, Kaye discussed how different world powers break the provisions of Article 19. One of the ways in which this occurs is when governments censor information on social media. 
 “The problem is that governments are increasingly putting pressure on social media sites,” Kaye said. “They’re going to them and saying ‘We have restrictions in our country, and you have to take down your content.’”
Another concerning infringement of Article 19, Kaye said, is digital surveillance. He said states are using surveillance to reduce freedom of expression. For example, Yahoo recently came to an agreement with the National Security Agency that would allow the NSA to parse through emails on Yahoo’s server. Though mass surveillance is a threat to one’s ability to seek and receive information, Kaye said, targeted surveillance is even more problematic.
“Direct attacks on digital rights is something very real and curtails both journalists and activists and others around the world,” Kaye said.
But Kaye argued that, while some content must be censored, some standards need to be put into place. 
“The problem is when governments ask media and other digital rights companies to take down that content, they’re not giving them any standards by which to do it,” Kaye said.
Surveillance and censoring by the government are covered the most when considering the ways that freedom is restricted, but Kaye said that access to the internet is an equally concerning lack of digital expression. Millions of people in the United States are unable to access the internet due to low socioeconomic status, disability or age, and Kaye said that lack of digital access divides people globally, as most of the world economy is now facilitated through the web. 
According to Kaye, there are three key ways to fix current threats to digital expression not only in the United States, but across the world. He said Americans need to pay attention to global human rights norms as outlined in Article 19, use legal and political strategies without and within the UN and focus on public campaigning as organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have done and, most importantly, that the international community needs to properly respond to digital attacks.
“We need to call out attacks on governments with the complicity of private actors,” Kaye said. “Every attack requires a response.”
   Kaye said that the digital age challenges to freedom are extremely important because in this generation, people all use technology to some degree.
“The fact that most people are online gives us the incentive to know who’s surveilling us, who’s following what we’re doing and also to know what choices we make that undermine our privacy or interfere with our freedom of expression,” Kaye said.
Correction: A previous headline of this article stated that David Kaye was a former rapporteur. He is still in the position. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Photo courtesy of Anthony UmanzorAuspicious starts · Students held up signs at the First-Generation Student Union’s booth at the involvement fair earlier this semester.
The First-Generation Student Union, an organization started this semester, aims to build a community where students who are the first in their families to go to college can support and share resources with one another. 
Trista Beard, the associate director of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund and club advisor, began brainstorming the idea with fellow faculty on the First-Generation Task Force and students over the summer. 
“There’s a lot that we could do across the University where we have thousands of first-generation students here at USC,” Beard said. “Talking with other staff and faculty that are involved with the first-generation task force, knowing there is student interest, I went to the staff and faculty and said, ‘I think this could take off as part of the First-Gen Task Force — let’s make this one of our initiatives, to have a student club.’ When I talked to some students about being the leaders and getting this thing started, there was a lot of interest.”
Beard — who is the first in her family to go to college — added that the club is modeled after Harvard’s first-generation student group. She said a lot of the issues that go along with being a first-generation student at an Ivy League school are echoed at USC. 
“That all rings true here, where we’re at an elite private school and, on the surface, it looks like there’s a lot of wealth and privilege and knowledge everywhere,” Beard said. “But there are students where that isn’t their background.” 
Beard said that the FGSU is a way for first-generation students to find each other, which is sometimes hard to do. 
“They are the first in their families to go to college, which is an amazing achievement,” Beard said. “How do we bring that up and talk about it in a positive light as a community? The first-gen club is a way to do that. It’s a way to be together as a community and talk about the challenges and successes of being the first in your family to go to college. It’s a way to give visibility to a hidden identity — we don’t talk about class — we don’t wear it on our sleeves.”
Marilyn Rodriguez, a senior majoring in human biology and one of the club’s student leaders, said in an email to the Daily Trojan that she wanted to start the club because many first-generation students at USC have a hard time navigating the school, and she felt that a supportive community would help that. 
“More often than not, most first-generation college students do not have a network of people that can assist them with developing skills that will help them excel at this institution,” Rodriguez wrote. “By creating this community, we hope to unite all first-generation students on campus both at the undergraduate and graduate level, to aid them through their transition by having workshops, mentors, providing a safe space to express their opinions and to become a single voice to advocate for first-generation student needs at USC.” 
Beard added that she hopes she will help facilitate student leadership in the club, rather than take on a leading role herself. She expressed a desire to hear student voices and see programming resulting from a decision-making process that is ultimately student-driven.
“I’m there as a coordinator and to help in any way I can, but the students have ideas of how we build community. We want to have the services that some other scholarship programs bring in, but focus it on first-gen.”
The first mixer of the FGSU will take place at 6 p.m. in SGM 124 on Thursday, Oct. 6.

Three new women were named members of the USC Board of Trustees on Wednesday: Miriam Adelson, Suzanne Dworak-Peck and Claude Mann. All three have been involved with bettering the community and improving the lives of others, be it medical, social or philanthropic work
A physician conducting research in drug addiction, Adelson founded, sponsors and serves as a chairman for two major drug abuse treatment and research centers in Las Vegas and Tel Aviv, Israel. 
Through her clinics, Adelson helps adults and teens overcome painkiller and opiate addiction. She and her husband, Sheldon G. Adelson, also support two foundations: the Adelson Family Foundation, backing Israel, and the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation, advancing medical research.
Suzanne Dworak-Peck has been a leader in the field of social work for 40 years, helping families in unfavorable conditions. She has served as president of the International Federation of Social Workers, the National Association of Social Workers and the organization’s California chapter. 
Focused on providing resources to the media, Dworak-Peck also founded the NASW Communications Network Inc. Just last month, she gave $60 million as a gift to the USC School of Social Work, now the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. She has received numerous honors and awards for her work.        
Elected a life trustee, Claude Mann serves as the executive vice president of gifting and development for the Alfred Mann Foundation, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to developing advanced medical products and named in honor of her late husband. 
 Mann served on the USC Board of Trustees from 1998 until his death in 2016 and donated more than $174 million to advance USC’s contributions to human health, establishing the Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. 
Mann has also received many awards, including the Women of Achievement Award from the Women of Sheba, the Woman of Valor Award from the Women’s International Zionist Organization and the Larry King Heart Award.
You can’t be serious  with Adelson. Her husband Sheldon is such a right wing conservative running  those casinos similar to Donald Trump’s legacy. He has no redeeming qualities in social areas. USC is still in the dark ages of money only matters. Lost the final respect for Nikias who has meddled in the sports department to the detriment of their success, and now this choice.

Trever Sochocki | Daily TrojanSlowing the stampede · Sophomore defensive back Iman Marshall will be among those tasked with stopping the Buffaloes’ potent offense, which is averaging 43.2 points per game and spreads the ball to many receivers.
USC football practiced on Wednesday with some legitimate momentum, perhaps for the first time this season. Although the Trojans dropped three games on the road early in the fall, they returned to the Coliseum last Saturday and cruised to a 41-20 win over Arizona State.
But there is no time to celebrate, as USC prepares for its fourth matchup against a ranked team this season. No. 21 Colorado visits Los Angeles on Saturday atop the Pac-12 South and averaging a whopping 43.2 points per game—including a 41-38 shootout victory at Oregon two weeks ago.
The Trojans terrorized Arizona State quarterback Manny Wilkins last week, and they will look to similarly contain Colorado’s dual-threat signal caller: freshman Steven Montez, who passed for three touchdowns last Saturday and rushed for 135 yards two weeks ago.
Although the blitz proved more than effective against the Sun Devils, Trojan defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said that wouldn’t become a pattern.
“It was situational — it’s about how we feel our matchups are and how we want to best utilize our guys based on those matchups,” he said. “So if we feel like we can get into throwing lanes against them, then we’ll do so, and if we feel like pressure is good, we’ll do that as well.”
Head coach Clay Helton echoed Pendergast, saying more blitzes weren’t necessarily part of the game plan, but he also said he thought the team needed to “be aggressive in all phases this week, whether it’s offense, defense or special teams.”
The Trojans also focused a great deal of attention on figuring out wideout Shay Fields, who has caught three passes over 60 yards in five games this season for the Buffaloes. The junior has also tallied five touchdowns—already a career high.
“Shay’s always been fast, but he’s really picked it up as a natural receiver,” said junior safety Chris Hawkins, who has played with the Bellflower, California native. “He’s making good [defensive backs] look pretty bad on tape.”
Helton called Fields’ big-play ability the best USC has seen to date. 
“The guy’s doing an incredible job over his career,” he said.
Fields and company will undoubtedly provide yet another tough challenge for the Trojans, but Helton said he was happy with his team’s progress just over a month into the season.
“The thing you hope as a head coach is that each unit is progressing and getting better as we move forward, and I think you’ve seen that from game one to right now,” he said. “Now our goal is to keep going — you need to be playing your best football in November when it matters most.”
Helton also provided updates on several injured Trojans. Redshirt senior right tackle Zach Banner continued to miss practice with an ankle issue, redshirt senior defensive end Jabari Ruffin remained in concussion protocol and redshirt freshman safety Ykili Ross was nursing a shoulder injury.
Helton said Banner and Ruffin were “50/50 at best” to play on Saturday, while Ross was doubtful. Banner received a platelet rich plasma injection today, but Helton admitted it was “not looking promising.”

Sarah Kim | Daily TrojanChop chop · Redshirt senior forward Katie Johnson, who netted a hat trick against Oregon State on Sunday to help extend the soccer team’s win streak to nine games, will look for more goals against No. 1-ranked Stanford.
The Trojans will face their biggest challenge so far this season on Thursday in a matchup against No. 1 Stanford. 
After a trip to Oregon notched two more victories for the Trojans, head coach Keidane McAlpine said that his team is solidifying its chemistry.
“I think you see the confidence and the way the girls mesh together on the field really coming together,” McAlpine said. “We’re becoming more consistent, we’re becoming more aggressive. We’re moving in the direction we need to be.”
The weekend moved the Trojans up to a No. 7 ranking as they continued in winning form, stretching to a nine-game streak. After taking down Oregon 3-1 on Thursday, redshirt senior forward Katie Johnson turned up the pressure and scored a hat trick to beat Oregon State 3-1 on Sunday.
The Trojans will need to continue to pressure on offense in order to take down a high-powered Stanford offense on Thursday. Stanford will bring the heat, led by MAC Hermann candidate Andi Sullivan. The midfielder has already scored four goals, doubling the points scored by Johnson even after Johnson’s three goals on Sunday. Sullivan is the engine for the team’s attack, and McAlpine said that if any player is a focus for his team, she will be it.
But the challenge with playing Stanford is the way the team operates as a unit. Although Sullivan is arguably one of the best college midfielders in the country, guarding her too heavily will allow for other talented scorers to get loose. And the Cardinal’s main focus is to spread teams out, creating both pace and positioning that is difficult to keep up with for 90 minutes.
Typically, the team is also equipped with one of the best backlines in the country with goalkeeper Jane Campbell in the net. She is chasing former U.S. goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart’s shutout record and backstops the Stanford defense. 
But after a collision with a Washington player in last Sunday’s game earned her a red card, Campbell is suspended from Thursday’s game. Freshman Alison Jahansouz will take her place after holding Washington to a 3-0 shutout with only 10 players on the field.
For McAlpine, the goal of Thursday’s game is to keep his team focused on the game, not the hype surrounding the team they are playing. It’s something he says hasn’t been a problem thanks to senior leadership.
“They really set the tone,” McAlpine said. “When we come into practice, there’s a certain feeling and everyone knows that okay, we’re going to be serious today. Even after [winning] last weekend, they were upset that we’d let in two goals, they were wanting to improve on that. They’re locked in and they’re ready.”

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanSpiking their way to history · Senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins finished with 5 kills to help USC win its 1,00th win in program history.
The No. 22 Women of Troy claimed their 1,000th win in program history en route to its fourth consecutive victory overall after beating Arizona State 3-1 at the Galen Center on Wednesday night.
Arizona State made the match interesting after winning the third set and avoiding the sweep, but USC  claimed the fourth set 25-20 to close out the win.
“I was really pleased with our match tonight … We’ve got our outside [hitters] all scoring in pretty good numbers,” head coach Mick Haley said.
The match began with strong Trojan momentum. Freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier, junior outside hitter Niki Withers and senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins led the team’s offense with 8 kills for Lanier, 3 for Withers, and 3 for Ruddins. Throughout the first set, the Trojans maintained a decently-sized lead, not allowing the Sun Devils to get within 5 points of them. Junior opposite Brittany Abercrombie and sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford soon added to the scoreboard for the Trojans. Senior libero Taylor Whittingham contributed to the momentum by holding a strong defense and acing her serves.
Meanwhile, the Sun Devils lacked coherence, with blocking errors and both serves and kills going out of bounds. The Trojans won the first set 25-15 with 17 cumulative kills for the team.
The second set was a more even pace. After the first few rallies, the Trojans took control of their serve receive and pulled ahead. Withers and Lanier maintained offensive domination with their kills and serves. Junior middle blocker Jordan Dunn also began to step up with 3 kills in the set.
Arizona State’s Cassidy Pickerell, Oluoma Okar and Jasmine Koontes attempted to respond, but the closest the Sun Devils came to the Trojans was a 20-17 deficit. Withers ended the set with 5 kills and Lanier with 4. The Trojans took the second set as well after a well-placed kill from Abercrombie.
“Our passing is better and better and better,” Haley said. “We are really starting to stay in rhythm now. We had a little dip in the serving concentration but that will happen every once in awhile.”
The third set saw a series of both kill and defensive errors that put the Trojans behind the Sun Devils. A kill from Ruddins gave the Trojans the opportunity to get back in control of the ball, but ASU returned with a kill from Maya McClendon and an ace from Nicole Peterson to put the Sun Devils in charge.
After a sub change, the Trojans regained a 3-point lead. However, this was quickly returned by ASU, and it came back to lead USC by one. The lead went back and forth, but the Sun Devils eventually took the third set 27-26 with a kill by Ivana Jeremic.
“Arizona State is physical and played much better tonight on controlling the ball,  so maybe this was one of their better matches,” Haley said.
At the start of the fourth set, the Trojans appeared more balanced and in control. Abercrombie started off the momentum with a quick kill that caught ASU off guard. The Trojans began with a 5-point lead. Withers, Ford and Lanier continued to contribute on offense. The confidence the  Women of Troy had been playing with in the first two sets returned in this set, leading to a historic 25-20 win for the Trojans.
Attention: You can’t win a set by one point which the score indicates for the 3rd one in your story. ASU was win less in the conference, and playing on the road. A must win match vs. Arizona on Friday who is a better team than ASU to prove WOT worth to being a top twenty squad. Think Lanier taking too many kill attempts while middle blockers need more with a much higher %.

Watching the football game from deep within the student section on Saturday, I was cautiously optimistic. There is no point in saying a trip to the Pac-12 Championship game is once again in reach, but at least USC has a chance to not be a losing team this year.
When the beginning of the football season rolled around, the Trojans were facing the toughest schedule in the country. But I certainly didn’t anticipate that through five weeks of the season, USC would have faced only undefeated teams.
This weekend will be the first time the Trojans face an opponent who hasn’t been perfect yet this year — the 4-1, No. 21 Colorado Buffaloes.
As surprising as the Trojans’ season has been, the Buffs’ has been equally so. They are not only another ranked opponent for USC, but also currently the lone leaders in the Pac-12 South.
The Trojans have had to play a ridiculously difficult schedule so far this year, and perhaps if the schedule were a little easier, the tune of this season would have been entirely different.
When the Trojans smashed ASU this past Saturday, it was only their second win of the year. Both wins have come against unranked opponents, with the other one being a Week 2 win over an underwhelming Utah State. Even though the Sun Devils were an undefeated team, as long as the Trojans prepared with diligence and approached the game with a humble attitude, they were expected to win. Couple that with an injured Sun Devil quarterback (the backup played the second half), and Arizona State never really had a chance.
Meanwhile, USC is preparing to face its fourth ranked opponent this season. The Trojans have yet to defeat any top 25 team. Does it matter that Colorado doesn’t know who its starting quarterback is? Did it matter that they entered the ranking while their usual starter has been injured and the team is being lead by a backup redshirt freshman? The answer is the same; no.
Many blindly faithful Trojan fans will be appalled at the matchup this week. How can Colorado be ranked while USC hasn’t received any votes? Part of it has to do with strength of schedule, but part of it has to do with being able to take care of business.
A positive note for the Trojans after Saturday’s 41-20 victory was that the team showed it is capable of doing what is expected of it, something that had been lacking this season up until that point.
Of course I think that USC is the superior football team to Colorado, but with the way things have gone so far this season, I wouldn’t be surprised if fans stream out of the Coliseum uttering curse words and calling for head coach Clay Helton’s head after a heartbreaking loss. Certainly USC has the more athletic team, but even in a sport like football, it has been clear so far this season that athleticism can only carry you part of the way.
Perhaps in hindsight the Trojans have played the most difficult part of their season, opening with three out of their first four games away from the Coliseum, but now, perhaps there is a different light on things. 
No one expected the upcoming game against Colorado to be anything more than a game that the Trojans would be expected to win with ease. Now, USC will have to battle another ranked opponent who will be gunning for them.
So maybe personnel choices and head coaching decisions have been the immediate cause for the problems the team has suffered thus far this season, but the overarching problem was that the schedule was far too tough for a team that was neither talented nor prepared enough to face its early competition.
The structure of the schedule contributed to this phenomenon as well. Had the Trojans not opened against Alabama (something they never would have been ready for), rebounded against Utah State, and not had to go into a highly competitive road contest with Utah, maybe they would have been able to get a stronger grip on the season, and maybe they would have a different starting quarterback.
None of that really matters though, since the sports world is solely a results-oriented business, and nowhere is that more obvious than here at USC. As the Trojans get a tougher and tougher draw — opponents seem to hop into the top 25 right before USC faces them — it gets harder and harder for the Trojans to have what is considered a successful season by the critics here in Troy.

A former USC football player is in the midst of a legal battle that could force the NCAA to rethink the way it compensates student athletes.
Lamar Dawson, a linebacker for USC from 2011 to 2015, filed a class-action lawsuit against the Pac-12 and the NCAA last Monday for violating state and federal wage laws. In doing so, he is attempting to redefine the relationship between college athletes and their schools into that of employees and employers.
According to Mark Rifkin, one of the three lawyers representing Dawson, the class-action lawsuit takes a narrow focus in discussing wage compensation for collegiate athletes. The suit is not suggesting that all athletes deserve wage compensation. Instead, it suggests that certain groups of athletes are treated differently by their colleges, leagues and by the NCAA based on the revenue they produce, and thus should be compensated differently.
“We think that there is something special about the relationship between the players and the leagues in the NCAA,” Rifkin said. “These are big time, big revenue, big business college sports. I think there’s a clear difference between a big sport like football and a non-revenue generating sport like women’s track and field. A big revenue sport like college football or basketball, it’s more business than anything.”
The NCAA is disputing the complaint’s premise, arguing that college athletes put academics before athletics — regardless of the success of their program.
“[We] strongly disagree with the notion that college students participating in athletics are employees,” Donald Remy, the organization’s chief legal officer, said in a statement. “Our experience is that these college students, like their non-athlete colleagues, are very focused on their academic endeavors. Moreover, they have a passion for their sport and a commitment to their teammates that can’t be equated to punching a time clock.”
However, in situations such as Dawson’s time in the USC football program, Rifkin believes that athletes are treated as employees rather than as students. It makes sense, Rifkin said, that when football programs have millions of dollars at stake, they treat the athletes generating that revenue in a much different light. 
For instance, USC made $59 million in revenue from the football program last year, according to USA Today. That revenue-generating machine is supported by 106 college students who spend hours in practices, fitness sessions and meetings every week. Dawson’s argument is that the football players creating this revenue stream should be appropriately compensated in accordance with both state and federal wage legislation.
“It doesn’t seem fair in some ways,” said Kelly Crabb, a USC law lecturer who specializes in sports, entertainment and media law as a partner at Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton, LLP. “The fans aren’t showing up to see the faculty play, or the administration or the trustees or the board of education. They’re showing up to watch these phenomenal athletes play and that’s the system. So the question naturally rises of why these athletes aren’t being compensated.”
Crabb understands the stance Rifkin and Dawson have taken, but he argues that the judge should carefully consider what the relationship should be between these athletes and their schools. Though college football and basketball programs have become a major industry, the players involved are first and foremost students who are mainly in college to pursue a future that won’t include athletics. And many of these athletes are compensated in their own way, receiving a partial or full scholarship and a degree.
According to the NCAA, 12.2 percent of college basketball players make it to the NBA, and just under 2 percent of college football players go professional. That means that the vast majority of collegiate athletes dedicate four years to their school and then pursue another career. For Crabb, this is an important distinction. 
“There’s a bunch of people who say look, I work 40-hour weeks, I work overtime, I look like an employee, I walk like an employee, I talk like an employee, I must be an employee,” Crabb said. “I find that argument compelling on some points, but I also think it’s important that these people came to college to get an education, and [athletics] was a way to get some financial support. That’s the focus.”
His main concern is that a broad ruling in Dawson’s favor could create a precedent for paying all collegiate athletes, including those in other sports that don’t generate anywhere close to the same revenue. This could fundamentally change the way that college athletics programs approach funding and recruiting.
This is why Dawson’s suit is specific in the wage compensation issues that it raises. Rather than attack an overall lack of wages for all collegiate athletes, it singles out those athletes who create significant revenue for the University. By state definitions, Rifkin argues, these athletes are employees and must be treated as such, and this argument stands as the backbone of the suit.
But even with this specific verbiage, Crabb fears that a ruling in Dawson’s favor could harm other athletic programs, especially women’s programs that don’t enjoy the same support or exposure as men’s programs. Traditionally, the revenue a school receives from their football and men’s basketball teams props up their women’s teams and less popular men’s teams. The same money also goes into renovations on athletic facilities, creating improvements that benefit all athletes. 
If this revenue was rerouted into wages for football and basketball players, Crabb believes that other athletes would see a drop in funding and attention from their school. And by providing wages as supplements to scholarships, colleges could potentially sidestep Title IX restrictions and provide greater compensation to male athletes than female athletes. Due to these concerns, Crabb is unsure that this case will make it very far.
Dawson’s suit is just another chapter in the debate of whether or not to pay collegiate athletes, an old fight that the NCAA is used to winning. Just this Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the similar class-action lawsuit of former UCLA basketball star Ed O’Bannon, who sued the NCAA for violating anti-trust laws. 
O’Bannon’s case paralleled a 2014 court case which ruled that the NCAA can’t use the names, images or likenesses of a college athlete without fair compensation. And in that same year, the Northwestern football team submitted a petition to the National Labor Relations Board to receive representation from a labor union. That request was declined by the board, which refused to offer a position either way and effectively punted the issue rather than face it head on. 
These cases reflect a back-and-forth battle between NCAA athletes and their governing body that has riddled college athletics for the last decade. Each case takes a different angle at compensation, which is why Dawson’s narrow angle is unique. By restricting its wording, Rifkin believes the suit provides an economically sound argument for paying a minor percentage of athletes producing a major percentage of NCAA revenue.
Ultimately, the case will have to be decided by a judge in due time. But Rifkin believes that the stance taken by his team will find success.
“All we want to see is that for the participants in big time college football programs, their compensation [will] comply with the laws in place,” Rifkin said. “I think it’s common sense.”

The 10 holiest days of the year are among us, Jewish Trojans. This past Sunday, the first night of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, marked the start of the High Holy Days. In addition, this coming Wednesday, the break of the fast on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, will conclude this period. These 10 days are a time for introspection, ultimately leading to the repentance for one’s sins of the previous year on Yom Kippur. Motivated by the possibility of not being written in the Book of Life for the coming year, it is custom to commit acts of “teshuvah, tefillah and tzedakah,” or repentance, prayer and charity during the days leading up to Yom Kippur. 
Aside from reconciling broken relationships with friends, family members and God, one very vital relationship not commanded to reconcile is one’s relationship with animals. That is not to say that one’s relationship with animals is not completely disregarded. Instead, the reparation of this relationship is implicitly hinted at. On Yom Kippur, for instance, wearing leather shoes is prohibited, since it’s quite reprehensible to wear the skin of a dead animal while asking God for mercy. It’s also customary to wear white on the Holiest Day of the Year, to not only show one’s optimism about being judged, but to be pristine and pure, calling upon the state of perfection epitomized by The Garden of Eden’s inhabitants, Adam and Eve, who were vegan. Let me explain.
In the beginning of Genesis, God tells Adam and Eve during their first conversation, “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat” (Genesis 1:29). Here, God explicitly commands Adam and Eve to strictly eat plants. It isn’t until Eve disobeys God and eats an apple from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that the first act of animal exploitation begins. After Eve’s act of rebellion, God curses Eve with childbearing pain, commands that Adam will rule over her, and skins animals and makes them into clothes for the two. However, it isn’t until the time of Noah that God commands the consumption of animals. “Every creature that is alive shall be yours to eat; I give them all to you as I did the green plants. Only flesh with its lifeblood still in it you shall not eat” (Genesis 9:3-4). 
So, the paradise that is the Garden of Eden before Eve audaciously eats the apple, as persuaded by the Serpent, is the ideal we should strive towards — to live in harmony with all living beings. What’s notable is that this harmony encompasses the absence of a patriarchy. Adam and Eve initially stand in front of each other naked without shame, because they did not realize their differences. Paradoxically, once a patriarchy is established and animals are skinned, chaos ensues and Adam and Eve are kicked out. Wearing white then is a marker of one’s purest state, before preconceived notions of a gender hierarchy and of speciesism. 
So, fellow Jewish Trojans, I ask you to continue your days of repentance with a few things in mind. 
First, please consider refraining from wearing or purchasing leather. As Rabbi Moses Isserles states, “How can a man put on [leather] shoes, a piece of clothing for which it is necessary to kill a living thing, on Yom Kippur, which is a day of grace and compassion?” There is no reason to wear a product made out of animal skin, that’s been produced at the cost of a life, when there are so many sustainable, comparable faux-leather alternatives. 
Additionally, try going vegan or vegetarian. Aside from fueling your body in the cleanest way, going vegan tackles the patriarchy by refraining from the exploitment of female animals. Also, dine at Hillel or Chabad this Shabbat, where they offer delicious vegan options at their weekly Shabbat dinners! 
Following these steps will ensure you a sweet New Year because there is no sweeter way to commence year 5777 than widening your sphere of compassion to all living beings and modifying already existing ones to love and respect.

Rising in the charts since their 2014 performance at USC, Phantogram made their way back to Los Angeles to perform a sold-out show at the Hollywood Palladium Tuesday evening. The band performed alongside opener The Range, an experimental electronic DJ hailing from Pennsylvania.
Phantogram is an alternative pop duo from Saratoga Springs, New York, formed by childhood friends Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel. The two started in 2007 by collaborating on songs in their hometown — soon, they began to perform together around New York. The two originally called themselves Charlie Everywhere as a joke. Yet as they continued to perform, their popularity spread and they eventually changed the name to Phantogram, which captures their dreamy, ghost-like sounds. Their style can be easily compared to other dream pop groups like Sylvan Esso, The xx, Glass Animals and The Naked and Famous.
Since the group’s inception in 2007, Phantogram has released four EPs, including Phantogram and Running From the Cops in 2009, Nightlife in 2011 and Phantogram in 2013, as well as three albums, including Eyelid Movies in 2009 and Voices in 2014. Phantogram’s new album, Three, is set for release Friday.
Amanda Verdadero | Daily TrojanGhosted · Phantogram’s new album Three, which features a darker sound and vibe from previous albums, is set to release on Friday.
The new album will be an evolution of the duo’s sound and will take a much darker route from what fans are previously used to. Three will feature singles such as “You Don’t Get Me High Anymore,” “Cruel World,” “You’re Mine,” “Run Run Blood,” “Same Old Blues” and “Calling All,” which were perhaps released early to get fans hyped for the fall tour.
“We try and put on a really good live show,” Josh Carter said in an interview with AZ Central. “And I think that translates and makes people excited to come the next time we’re in their hometown. The new live show is gonna be ridiculous… I’m stoked.”
Ridiculous, it was. The live show encapsulated Phantogram’s magical and beautiful style, with haunting scenery to go along with their dream pop sounds. Their set started with geometric projections that were carefully crafted to hit a scrim in front of the stage, giving the audience a seemingly floating and ghostly image to go along with the popular hit, “Black Out Days,” from their sophomore album Voices.
As the night went on, the performance got more intense, with eerie shadows, fog and projections to complement Phantogram’s dark style. The duo performed a new song called “Destroyer,” a haunting melody that was captured in front of flame projections with singer Sarah Barthel cloaked on a platform surrounded by fog, creating an illusion that she was on fire.
Other highlights included the emotional new song, “Cruel World,” which utilized the scrim and projections to create unreal phantasmal images that looked like white spirits floating around the stage.
Phantogram finished the night strong with a red hot performance of their single, “You Don’t Get Me High Anymore.” As a result, the audience began to dance to the cool rock-and-roll melody, closing out an unforgettable night.

Photo courtesy of Warmer Bros. RecordsWe’ve been livin’ like a party · GTA, or Good Times Ahead, will release their self-titled album on Oct. 7. The duo has previously performed at Springfest in 2015, as well as Electric Daisy Carnival.
GTA, the electronic duo from Miami, consists of Julio Mehia and Matt Toth and stands for Good Times Ahead. The name is clearly prophetic when married with their music’s potential. Their shows promise exactly that, so it only makes sense the debut album reiterates the hype. The duo has been making quite a stir with their album Good Times Ahead, which is slated for release on Oct. 7.  The following day, GTA will celebrate at the Shrine Expo Hall with a special show.
The duo has worked with a multitude of artists, such as Diplo, Flosstradamus, Laidback Luke and Martin Solveig. But something about going from multiple singles to a coherent album led to a deeper sound. GTA has the unique ability of adapting to their featured artist rather than the other way around. One of the singles “Little Bit Of This” features Vince Staples. It’s a definitive party song ready to keep the summer alive even as winter approaches. It’s the perfect recipe of playfulness, tribal percussion and a simple but dancy beat. On the other end, their song with Tinashe has a synthier vibe. It’s an interesting take on Tinashe’s R&B style as they use party beats to play with her soulful sexiness.
The Shrine show not only promises GTA’s usual ability to make audiences go wild and crazy, but there will be additional excitement in the air as they launch the debut album. This is not to mention the many special guests in attendance. And with the collaborations the pair have under their belt, it can only be assumed they’ll be joined by A-listers.
This won’t be the first time GTA shows love for the Trojan Family. Back in 2015, the pair took the Springfest stage and while the performance had its faults, Mehia and Toth have come back stronger and are more than ready to show USC a good time.
A quick perusal of live performance videos shows that the duo’s music gets the crowd going and their passion for having a good time quickly becomes contagious. Not to mention, their light show is almost as on point as their hat game. And it’s not uncommon for crowd-wide “hands-up” calls to turn into an Electric Daisy Carnival style flash mob.
They have performed at multiple festivals, including this year’s Las Vegas EDC, and if they can make thousands scream with one call to action, it’s almost a guarantee that a ticket to their Shrine show will make the holder go wild. The show is one of many in the group’s tour, ending in Florida later this month, but the Shrine should be something special.
With the group’s album coming out on Friday, the hype will be real as the band celebrates its debut release. And to show how much they love Trojans, USC students have been given a discount code. 
Since the show is on a game day, there’s no better way to wrap up school spirit-centered celebrations than raving with the best. And if school spirit isn’t enticing, avoid FOMO by spending the day getting ready for what promises to be one of the best Shrine experiences yet – and  it’s within walking distance.
We went to GTA’s show at The Regency Ballroom in San Francisco on Saturday. Their set was pretty good. They mixed bunch of their new old and new material with popular hip-hop and rock tunes of past years. There also played plenty of today’s hits  and bangers. GTA is good addition to any EDM festival lineup.

Amanda Verdadero | Daily TrojanCoffee please, with a shot of cynicism · Gilmore Girls fans everywhere gathered in coffee shops to relive the ABC Family show all over again on Wednesday morning. Scott Patterson, who plays Luke Danes in the show, made a appearance at a Beverly Hills location.
Gilmore Girls fans across America united this Wednesday as Netflix gave them the opportunity of a lifetime — the chance to visit the one and only Luke’s Diner.
The popular ABC Family show, which aired from 2000 to 2007, centers around the lives of single mom Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter, Rory Gilmore. The show takes place in a tiny, but wacky Connecticut town, Stars Hollow, which is where Luke’s Diner is located.
Lorelai and Rory often visit the diner for a daily cup of coffee and danish, or to hang out with Luke, the cynical but caring owner of the diner with an affinity for flannel and backwards baseball caps, and a hatred of cell phones.
To promote the revival, Netflix turned coffee shops across the country into a Luke’s Diner to give fans a chance to be a Gilmore Girl for a day. The popular coffee shop Comoncy in Studio City was converted into the famous diner from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m., with fans lining up out the door to grab a cup of coffee and channel their inner Lorelai. The shop featured a sign outside the diner, a “no cellphones” sign and even a cardboard cutout of Luke with cynical quotes, just like in the show.
Many fans waited two hours or more, but once inside they were able to purchase Luke’s signature coffee, with Luke’s logo on the coffee sleeve. Also on the coffee cups were special Snapchat barcodes to get more updates about the new miniseries and other codes to get a free month of Netflix. Some fans at the Studio City location also got a Stars Hollow treat when actor Aris Alvarado, who played the diner’s cook, Caesar, stopped by to greet fans.
“I started watching Gilmore Girls on Netflix with my housemates after I heard there was going to be a revival,” said Carly Hildebrand, a senior majoring in public relations who went to the Studio City pop-up. “I haven’t watched the trailer because I don’t want to be spoiled on what happens in the later seasons, but I’m already excited to see what Rory does after she graduates and what small town antics Stars Hollow is up to.” 
The show spanned seven seasons, following Lorelai and Rory’s lives from Rory’s high school years and beyond, often expressing themes of friendship, love, community and growing up. When Gilmore Girls concluded in 2007, many were sad to see their childhood friends leave their living rooms.
 However, Netflix has revamped the project, returning it to the screen as a miniseries in November. The revival will feature four 90-minute episodes with almost all of the original cast members, including Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Scott Patterson, Melissa McCarthy, Keiko Agena, Liza Weil, Sean Gunn and Yanic Truesdale.
The revival is set to premiere on Nov. 25, with events picking back up eight years after the end of season 7. Until then, all seven seasons of Gilmore Girls are available on Netflix for viewing in preparation for the series’ return.

While the name Omran Daqneesh may not sound familiar, his face is impossible to forget. In August he was brought to a hospital after an airstrike in Aleppo. A photo was taken of the 5-year-old staring blankly, covered in dust and blood. The picture immediately struck a chord with people worldwide. It was retweeted thousands of times, redistributed in various forms to raise awareness and was widely understood as a shocking symbol of Syria’s overlooked suffering. Despite this widespread attention, however, the plight of Syrian children and refugees is still too often overlooked.
 Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, was asked what he would do to address the refugee crisis in Aleppo. He, now infamously, responded, “What is Aleppo?” However, in their reporting of Johnson’s embarrassing answer, The New York Times itself had to issue two corrections after misidentifying Aleppo as the de facto capital of ISIS and the capital of Syria. In the first presidential debate, despite addressing several issues of foreign policy and national security, Syria was hardly mentioned at all.
 According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 426 civilians, including 78 children, have been killed from Sept. 19 through to Oct. 4. So, when the election mostly ignores Syria even in the face of this rising death toll, we must ask ourselves: How do we make sure people care?
 Various social media campaigns have tried tackling this question. The UN created a virtual reality video, “Clouds Over Sidra,” in which viewers follow a young Syrian girl through a refugee camp. However, even without cutting edge VR technology, Syrians have been able to raise awareness about the plight of Syrian children through Twitter hashtags. One in particular capitalized on the Pokemon Go trend. Children in Syria were photographed holding up pictures of Pokemon, or in some cases, Pokemon were digitally photoshopped onto the photos of children amongst the rubble of war. The juxtaposition of the war-torn buildings and the Pokemon characters is unsettling and forces the audience to reevaluate their own priorities. 
However, not all awareness campaigns are created equal. Save the Children, a London-based NGO, created a PSA that imagined London as a country in the midst of a brutal war. The video and its sequel follow a young girl through the traumas of life as a child in a war-torn country and, subsequently, as a refugee. Though the campaign intended to solve the very problem we must confront — how to ensure that people know and care about the conflict in Syria — it builds empathy by placing a white child as the protagonist. This only serves to reinforce the racism that has caused such backlash against Syrian refugees and apathy toward the plight of Syrian civilians. 
Social media and all its awareness campaigns can also have the exact opposite effect of generating empathy. Seeing a photo of a child who drowned while escaping Syria shared on someone’s Facebook timeline ad nauseum may generate some level of awareness; however, it also has the potential to desensitize and dehumanize. While videos of children in hospitals may move us more than statistics, it is important to remember that feeling bad is not enough. The empathy generated by viral videos and awareness campaigns must be channeled into organizing, donation and political pressure. 
Lena Melillo  is a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and gender studies.  Her column, “’Pop Politics,” runs every  Thursday.
Well written, Lena. Your conclusion was “The empathy generated by viral videos and awareness campaigns must be channeled into organizing, donation and political pressure.” Organizing what? Donation? Yes, but to whom? The Syrian regime and the Russian forces attack or turn away UN convoys. So donations are well-intended, but go nowhere and are merely a pointless gesture.
“Political pressure?” Against whom? ISIS? The Syrian regime? Russia? Without military action, we have no means of exerting political pressure. Diplomacy will not work when the other side is hell-bent on aggression and war. They do not want to parley. Economic sanctions are equally ineffective in such a situation. Mr. Assad and Mr. Putin would merely laugh. ISIS leaders are obviously beyond our pressure, other than to attack them. We were doing that from the air, but Russia is now providing air cover and our Government does not want aerial battles with Russian fighters.
Lena, you might respond “but we’ve got to do something to alleviate the horrible suffering of the Syrian people!” I fear that unless we are willing to enter a war there on their behalf with ISIS and Russia, we have nothing we can do. Or as you wrote – feel empathy – or maybe sympathy is more accurate. Sorry, but there it is. World events exist where the US has no recourse of action but war. This is one of them.

Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
On Oct. 2, Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump tweeted the hashtag #failing@nytimes to show his disdain for The New York Times report on his tax returns. On a broader scale, the hashtag epitomizes his general feelings toward the paper’s coverage on his campaign over the past year. Before this surreal election year, one might think Trump was insulting the corrupt referee at his son’s 7th-grade soccer game, not the (arguably) most famous newspaper in the world. Surely if anyone is doing reliable reporting, it is the paper with 199 Pulitzers on its mantle. 
Nevertheless, Trump is unabashedly against them — but he is not entirely wrong for it. 
In the past week, there have been more than 20 articles written on Donald Trump — and that’s just looking at the opinion section. The obsession with Trump has catalyzed an inundation of articles on the Republican nominee that leaves one wondering what is exactly going on at The Times. Opinion pieces are not just “the news,” but rhetorically stylistic and argumentative persuasive pieces that offers new insights to a topical issue. The New York Times opinion section has been beating the anti-Trump horse to death. There are only so many ways to condescendingly refer to his voters, and opinion writers at prestigious newspapers should be offering more nuanced or even just new pieces of the election. 
 Unfortunately, The Times has spent too much time printing bland or repetitive pieces that have taken away any reason to read the paper this season. 
This is not to say that every piece published is entirely garbage. Max Boot published a piece on Trump and his legacy in the Republican party that offered new and interesting perspectives on the election. Unfortunately, most articles are painfully pointless in their criticism — one was quite literally just a list of statements Trump has made contradicting one another. There is no argument, persuasion or stylization explaining why this is worth anyone’s time. Now, many would argue that Trump is so depraved that he needs no explanation — his statements speak for themselves. Trump, it seems, is the exception to normal campaign coverage, and it is in this fallacy that The Times fails us all this year. 
Freedom of press is still a beloved value, and one of the best parts of the opinion section is that a writer can ignore an unbiased argument and write his or her opinion. However, the lack of pieces in support of Trump matches the lack of pieces on Hillary. 
The Times, along with many Americans, forget that Donald Trump is a man — a human being — not an evil robot who feeds off of certain prejudices. The Times opinion writers often take extreme approaches to his words, essentially taking one quote of his and blasting it for an entire article. Their ruthless offensive slam pieces on Trump only make him stronger. Donald Trump may be evil in his words and in his politics, but the media has created a monster-persona that has done nothing but make his actual presence seem tame. 
Overall, they are right about Trump, no doubt. But when opinion pieces become nothing more than a rant with a clickbait title, one starts to sympathize with Trump’s tweets calling out the unfair fixation on him.
 Journalistic standards should not be lowered to match the standards of those they write about. Few pieces have been written on the first female major party candidate in comparison to her opponent, and their ambiguous (yet baiting) style leaves her “sketchy” rumors up to anyone’s speculation. At this point, The New York Times seems to be reveling in its “obvious” rightness about this entire election and seems content to sit back and just be right about everything. Their goal is murky at best. 
Dissuade Republican voters? Convince undecided ones? They seem to be ranting about everything Trump says in the news with no thought to insight at all. Trump may well be correct in his hatred for this news source, who has done nothing but call him names ad nauseam while ignoring real issues in the election. So yes, anyone would sound like a deranged old man for threatening to sue The Times and calling them out their willingness to “say anything.” But in Trump’s case, he has earned that right.

Being an international student in America can be as unnerving as it is exciting. Amidst all the initial chaos and anxiety of settling in, most of us are bitten by the “Explore L.A.” bug. 
One leisurely afternoon, a group of friends and I hopped onto a bus and ended up in the Venice Canal Historic District. Downtown L.A., Santa Monica Pier, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame are full of the usual beachy and affluent allure that you can expect from a sprawling metropolis and a bustling coastal city. Venice Beach does offer all that, but in Canal Walkway, we had stumbled upon a slice of L.A. quite different from the expected. 
Shruthi Hiriyuru | Daily Trojan
Nestled away from the usual hustle and bustle of the beach traffic is a pretty neighborhood with a network of canals enclaved by lovely landscaped gardens and what I can only describe as L.A.’s most eclectic residential architecture. There is something arrestingly beautiful about the pretty houses that flank the canals. Tiny bohemian-style cottages to million-dollar ultra-modern houses – each one is so unique; it’s a pretty envious sight! 
For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this fixation with imagining what a casual household day of the residents would look like just from glimpsing at the houses as I passed by. And each one that caught my attention here wove a different story in my mind. I could picture an elderly couple spending leisurely mornings tending to their garden of beautiful potted flowers at the entrance of their pretty cottage; A bunch of cousins spending their vacation frolicking in the pool and sunbathing in the patio at their upscale vacation retreat; A large family gathered at the ornate table in the front yard, making small talk and catching up over a mug of beer!
The canals themselves, with their still, shimmering waters, connected by quaint little bridges and rowboats and kayaks moored to the docks in front of the houses, complete the picture of a perfect landscape in your mind. We were lucky we ended up there on a weekday; There was less foot traffic than usual, so we got a better look into the pure, untouched beauty of the place.
If you move on to the more happening streets towards the beach, you are in for an artsy surprise. Lovely murals adorn the walls around the beach boardwalk. From an impressive tribute to Vincent Van Gogh’s Starry Night to contemporary and controversial public art, the boardwalk has it all.
Shruthi Hiriyuru | Daily Trojan
Further along, Venice Beach houses an open skate park with ramps and curves for every level right by the shore. A favorite hangout spot among the local skateboarders, you can watch some really talented ones glide along, segueing into one trick after another effortlessly and leaving you mesmerized and wanting for more.
I went in as a tourist, enchanted by the novelty of it all, but came back with the smug satisfaction of having explored the nuances of a part of the place that will be my home for the next two years.
