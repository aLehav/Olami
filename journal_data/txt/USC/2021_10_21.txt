Students gathered outside Sigma Nu on the Row Thursday after the University put the Sigma Nu fraternity house on interim suspension because of drugging and sexual assault reports.
The interim suspension was announced in a communitywide email sent by the Department of Public Safety Wednesday night. Sigma Nu is forbidden from hosting social events at its house and holding any events or activities, according to the email. 
Following the email, multiple incidents of drugging and assault were reported to DPS ranging between Sept. 27 to Oct. 20. At the time of publication, the DPS crime log had seven different reports related to drugging — six at Sigma Nu, while one was at an undisclosed location.  
According to an anonymous source within Sigma Nu, the person accused of the assault was removed from the fraternity the day before DPS’s email.
LAPD confirmed in an email to the Daily Trojan that there is an ongoing investigation but wrote that no arrest had been made. 
The protest addressed long-standing problems with Greek life, protesters said, including complacency, racism and misogyny.
“I think it’s ridiculous. I don’t think [USC has] said anything of substance,” said Finley Davis, a senior majoring in political science and Spanish. “Even the houses on the Row, even sorority houses aren’t saying anything. It’s more about protecting themselves and the institutions that they’re a part of than it is actually protecting the people who are harmed by them.”
Davis, who is also a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, also criticized sororities’ lack of presence at the protest and said now should be the time for Greek life to show it “doesn’t stand for this.” 
“I’ve seen less than 10 people from my own house, which is right across the street. I haven’t seen any sororities show up in actual numbers, which was shocking to me, and we were told not to wear our letters or anything with our house on it,” Davis said. “And the frats were told that, too.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the Interfraternity Council said the allegations went against their work for sexual assault prevention and awareness. They added that all social events had been suspended until “deliberate action” was taken including actionable steps such as “social events, recruitment, new member processes, and the ways members are held accountable.”
“We are disgusted this violence took place in our community,” the statement read. “There is no place for this abhorrent misconduct nor a culture that supports it in the Interfraternity Council community at the University of Southern California or anywhere.”
Quinn Pettit, a junior majoring in environmental studies, said the issues in Greek life are systemic and the culture allows sexual assaults to occur more frequently. 
“There is a greater issue, and it’s that the entire system allows for sexual assault … in Greek life more than in most other situations,” Pettit said. “There’s a reason behind that, and it’s that the system allows for men to take advantage of women.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that it provides a “fair, thorough and timely resolution process.”
“USC takes reports of sexual assault extremely seriously and has a coordinated response team designed to promptly respond,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “While we are unable to discuss the specifics of this matter due to student privacy laws, we are unequivocal in our commitment to fostering a safe environment for all of our students, faculty and staff.” 
However, Pettit said the University should work more to address the sexual assault incidents beyond suspensions.
“I think it’s absolutely unacceptable that this behavior continues and that the system allows for it to happen,” Pettit said. “I feel like the University is not doing enough about it. Canceling parties is not going to make up for lifelong trauma that somebody is going to experience.” 
A junior majoring in business administration, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of the topic, said she knows many people — including herself — who have been sexually assaulted. The student said she hopes there will be more accountability beyond the interim suspension in place. 
“If there’s someone in the house that sexually assaults someone, then why are you only on interim probation,” the student said. “You should be expelled and kicked off the Row — like that doesn’t make any sense. There’s just not enough accountability.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the Sigma Nu Fraternity headquarters wrote that it will work with the University’s investigation and is “concerned” by the allegations.
“The Fraternity will determine its further actions based upon the investigation. Sigma Nu Fraternity remains committed to responding appropriately to all matters of confirmed misconduct,” the email read.  
After Sigma Nu’s suspension, multiple fraternities canceled parties and mixers scheduled for this weekend, according to information obtained by the Daily Trojan.
Sigma Nu is not the first fraternity put on interim suspension by the University.
In 2018 and 2019, the University suspended Sigma Alpha Mu, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Phi Sigma Kappa and Pi Kappa Phi for hazing allegations.
It also suspended Pi Kappa Alpha for alleged drug use, as well as Sigma Delta Alpha and Tau Kappa Epsilon because of prior investigations related to hazing. 
In 2013, the National Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity officially banned the Sigma Phi Epsilon California Beta Chapter “for up to five years” after reports of sexual misconduct. The chapter does not currently exist at the University.
While the University lifted Phi Sigma Kappa and Sigma Alpha Mu’s suspensions after a month, Pi Kappa Phi lost University recognition the same year because of a hazing investigation. In 2019, the University stopped recognizing Theta Xi after a separate hazing investigation.
The investigation into Sigma Nu is ongoing. The Daily Trojan reached out to DPS for a comment but was referred to LAPD. 
Sasha Ryu contributed to this report. 
UPDATE: This story was updated 10/21 at 11:40 p.m. to include LAPD and IFC’s statement. Information from an anonymous source from Sigma Nu and a student interview was also added. The USC chapter of Sigma Nu did not respond to multiple requests for a comment.
Editor’s note: The story will be updated with statements from LAPD and IFC. The Daily Trojan also reached out to the USC Sigma Nu chapter for a statement but did not hear back in time for publication.

The last three games were trademark United States Men’s National Team play. A simple 2-0 win against Jamaica, followed by a dreadful 1-0 loss to Panama and a scrappy 2-1 win over Costa Rica has the U.S. in second place with 11 points in the Octagon, trailing only Mexico. Welcomed optimism and absolute rock-bottom pessimism evened out to the usual feeling by the end: I’m unconvinced.
It starts with the guy in charge. It’s time to talk about Manager Gregg Berhalter. 
Berhalter is in the midst of his first World Cup Qualifying campaign in charge of the USMNT. His success in the summer had fans really excited to see what the team could do in its revenge tour after missing out on the 2018 World Cup. While the U.S. certainly isn’t in a bad spot by any means, we really should be closely examining whether Berhalter is the right guy moving forward. 
First, let me set the record straight: Berhalter is a good dude. He brings passion and emotion to the sidelines every game and takes accountability when the team is underperforming. When I see the way he makes adjustments during the game and yells out commands to the players, it really does give me the impression he knows what he’s doing and is a good leader. But the results on the pitch just aren’t matching my outlook on him as a person. 
What stands out most is Berhalter’s inability to pick starting lineups, a flaw glaringly apparent against Panama. It’s important to note his mind was in the right place — he made seven changes to the previous starting 11 in the name of squad rotation because the team played three games in one week. But despite his good intentions, he went way, way overboard. 
The team against Panama was basically a second-level side, with the likes of Gyasi Zardes, Sebastian Lletget, George Bello and Kellyn Acosta starting (I picked those names for their uninspiring performances — do better next time lads). I’ll admit I have a bias against MLS players on the U.S. team, but it’s no secret that these guys just don’t match the level of talent we should be fielding, with stronger options like Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams starting the game on the bench. 
But much worse than the lack of talent on the team was the lack of cohesion. And what did Berhalter expect? You simply can’t change out more than half the team and expect things to gel on the road in CONCACAF games. It was a mistake that, if we’re being real with our expectations, shouldn’t be acceptable in the long term. 
The funniest part about Berhalter’s team selection was the Costa Rica game, where he chose to start MLS winger Paul Arriola over Ligue 1 winger Timothy Weah. Arriola was scratched before the game with an injury, giving Weah the chance to start, and what do you think he did? That’s right, he created the winning goal with a shot that hit the post and bounced off of the Costa Rican keeper for an own goal. Do I think the goal was a little lucky? Yes. Do I think Arriola would’ve created the same chance? Absolutely not. Taking a step back, a draw in that game would’ve put the U.S. in third place, 5 points off of Mexico in first place. I don’t think it’s unfair to say Berhalter is quite lucky that Weah ended up playing instead of his preferred Arriola. 
I had high hopes for Berhalter. I didn’t think I would be writing about him in a critical manner this early into World Cup Qualifying. This competition is unforgiving, and the U.S. cannot afford to waste time with a manager who can’t unlock the full potential of the team. 
It may sound premature, but the day of reckoning could be upon Berhlater. The next match is easily the most important of perhaps all of World Cup Qualifying for the U.S. — Mexico at home Nov. 12. A loss could send the team spiraling, and with a few other games going the wrong way, the U.S. could end up as low as fourth in the table (outside of the automatic qualification spots). This is the worst case scenario, and I’m jumping the gun a bit speculating this, but we’ve seen in the past how everything can go wrong for the USMNT very quickly. Berhalter should be on thin ice right now, even if fans want to hold on to the successes of the past summer.
To be clear, I have high expectations for this team. I want the USMNT to qualify for the 2022 World Cup by any means necessary, of course, but scrapping in via the playoff would be disappointing. I would even go as far to say that failing to finish in the top two would be a failure in some regard. My expectations for the team rest mostly on the manager. We have the personnel to place first in the Octagon, but I’m not sold that Berhalter is the right guy for the job. 
Time will tell, as it always does, and I’m hoping I’ll be wrong for doubting Berhalter. Until then, speculation will be rampant because there’s no team more dramatic than the U.S.

Los Angeles City Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas pleaded not guilty to federal bribery and conspiracy charges at his arraignment Wednesday in downtown L.A. Just hours before Ridley-Thomas’ plea, the L.A. City Council voted to suspend him because of the charges. 
Ridley-Thomas appeared virtually from his attorney’s office. His bail is set at $50,000. 
The charges stem from Ridley-Thomas’ controversy involving former dean of the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work Marilyn Louise Flynn.
The 20-count indictment accuses Ridley-Thomas and Flynn of a bribery scheme to benefit  Mark Ridley Thomas’s son, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, who received a full-tuition scholarship to the councilman’s alma mater and a paid faculty position, according to court documents. 
The charges allege that Ridley-Thomas funneled money to the University that was put into nonprofit organizations run by his son. In exchange, he used his position on the L.A. County Board of Supervisors to support contracts and services to benefit the University. The indictment also accuses Ridley-Thomas and Flynn of concealing their actions.
Only two days after Ridley-Thomas said he would “immediately step back” from Council and Committee meetings, the City Council approved Ridley-Thomas’ suspension with an 11-3 vote in a special session.
City Council President Nury Martinez submitted the motion to bar the councilman from activities such as executing contracts or using discretionary funds. 
“The trial on the indictment has yet to take place and a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty,” Martinez wrote in the letter. “[However], a Councilmember who has been charged with public corruption cannot continue to exercise the powers of City office and preserve public trust.” 
Following the vote, L.A. City Controller Ron Galperin announced he will suspend Ridley-Thomas’ pay because he can no longer carry out his duties or represent his constituents.
“While Ridley has had many years of honorable public service, I will not use City money to pay the salary of an elected official facing federal bribery and fraud charges who is now legally unable to do his job,” wrote Galperin on Twitter. 
Only Councilmembers Mike Bonin, Curren D. Price — who represents the area encompassing University Park Campus — and Marqueece Harris-Dawson voted no on the motion. Ridley-Thomas was absent from the meeting because of his decision to step down from council activities. 
“The allegations in this indictment are serious, and they’re egregious, and if they are proven to be true Mr. Ridley-Thomas, the accused, should be punished,” said Bonin, who voted against Ridley-Thomas’ suspension. “He absolutely should be removed from office. Those allegations have not been proven true. The ink is barely dry on those allegations.”
Councilman Curren D. Price, the University’s representative who also voted no, said the Council cannot take a stance on the allegations alone. Residents have called Price’s office to express concern about Ridley-Thomas’ suspension, Price said in the Council meeting. 
“We have to pause and not rush to judgement,” Price said. “Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas has a right to due process, and that should take place in a court of law, not in the Council chambers. After all, the law states that one is presumed innocent until proven guilty. And I choose to operate from a position of fairness, respect and decency.”
In a statement released after his suspension, Ridley-Thomas criticized the Council’s decision but said he was “humbled” by the support of his colleagues who voted no.
“Eleven members of this Council have stripped the constituents of the 10th District of their representation, of their voice and of their right to the services that they deserve,” Ridley-Thomas said. “They have removed from action a member — and his team — who together are among the most productive and effective advocates on the crisis of homelessness.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, attorney Michael J. Proctor, who represents Ridley-Thomas, wrote that today is “day one for due process” for Ridley-Thomas. 
“While some have rushed to judgment, perhaps for political gain, we all win when we afford our brothers and sisters the constitutional entitlement to the presumption of innocence,” Proctor wrote. “Our lifelong public servant Mark Ridley-Thomas said today in Court that he is innocent; I invite our community to breathe life into that right.”
In a statement to City Attorney Mike Feuer, Proctor said the City Council committed “an unlawful act” by suspending him. Proctor also said that Ridley-Thomas will continue to serve his constituents despite his suspension.
In response to the charges brought against Ridley-Thomas, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors will conduct an independent audit to review any contracts or policies at the center of the controversy. The external investigation will bring in a law firm to investigate those contracts or policies.
Flynn’s arraignment will take place Monday.

Content warning: This article contains references of sexual violence.
Panelists discussed the “red and green flags” of relationship behaviors to help people understand the components of maintaining a healthy and consensual relationship at a virtual event Wednesday.
Hosted by USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, the event, titled “Red flags and green flags: Shedding light on toxic dating behaviors,” focused on identifying toxic traits, why people find themselves stuck in abusive relationships and how to help those who are affected.
The discussion featured three panelists: Chief Program Officer at the People Concern, TuLynn Smylie, Vivian Engle, a clinician at Jewish Family Services Los Angeles, and Katie Bates, a violence prevention educator at the relationship and sexual violence prevention and service branch of the Keck School of Medicine.
Engle explained the intricacies of an abusive relationship and how subtle some red flags may be. For example, Engle said gaslighting puts the victim in an uncomfortable situation that they may feel responsible for.
“[Victims] don’t want to talk to [friends and family] about what’s going on,” Engle said. “You feel embarrassed, ashamed, the isolation piece we talked about where you blame yourself. It’s part of the manipulation tactic and the gaslighting to make you feel responsible for everything.”
Sendy Ramirez, a graduate student studying social work, attended the event to attain more perspective about sexual violence and gain an ability to educate others as a survivor of domestic survivor herself.
“I really appreciated that there was a thorough conversation about the red flags,” Ramirez said. “So many things that were discussed today that I saw in my relationship, that I saw in my abuser, but I didn’t have the knowledge or the awareness at the time to recognize them as red flags.”
The panelists emphasized the importance of having the ability to acknowledge potentially dangerous behavior early on, especially for college students who may find themselves in their first intimate relationship.
“Anybody can fall victim to intimate partner violence, and anyone can become an abuser too,” Smylie said. “The thing is with college-age students … it may be their first time away from home, they may be feeling lonely and isolated and getting involved in a relationship that if they were in any other circumstance they might not [be in].”
The discussion also focused on ways others can help those who face abuse in intimate relationships by becoming what Bates labeled a “pro-social upstander.”
“Somebody that steps in and does something positive that intervenes in a positive way is what we call pro-social upstander,” Bates said. “[To become a pro-social upstander] we consider the four D’s … delegating, distracting, directing or debriefing.”
Experts in sexual violence often use these four D’s as a strategy to teach people ways to insert themselves in situations that appear to be dangerous for a party involved.
The panelists made clear that their respective organizations accepted all victims, regardless of their identity or situation.
“I really appreciated the fact that all the panelists empowered the victims by taking the position of ‘Let’s not victim blame. Let’s stop asking ‘why does she leave, or he [leave],’” Ramirez said. “[The panelists were] here to be advocates, but [they were] really here in your corner, and it’s not just lip service.”

After 21 hours on an airplane from India to the United States, all Aadhya Ishani wanted was to go to bed. However, once she arrived in Los Angeles, Ishani said she didn’t get a full night’s sleep for two weeks straight. 
According to Ishani, when she and her roommates moved into their off-campus apartment, the smoke detectors in their unit chirped non-stop because the owners of the building hadn’t replaced the batteries in the alarms and didn’t come in after she and her roommates sent in “multiple” work orders.
“It was totally an emotional roller coaster,” said Ishani, a graduate student studying business law. “We were still settling in, so you can understand the jetlag, and then [there was the] noise all night which was coming from the smoke detector because the batteries were low.” 
Ishani is one of four USC students who said they’ve had negative experiences renting from First Choice Housing — an apartment rental agency that owns 77 housing units near USC’s University Park Campus. On Yelp, First Choice has 228 user reviews and an average of 3.5 stars. On Google, the agency has 71 user reviews and an average of 1.7 stars. Most of the tenants who left critical comments online voiced their dissatisfaction with the maintenance of the units as well as the agency’s management style.  
Zaire Taylor, a senior majoring in communication who signed a lease with First Choice Housing in July 2020, said the first time First Choice let her see her apartment in person, it was “in a state of disrepair.” 
“The floors were so run down to the point of there being tiny little holes in the wood,” Taylor said. “The paint is chipping off the walls and caked everywhere … We realized immediately that the shower was broken.” 
Taylor also said the blinds in most of the rooms came undone, with “single panels thrown across the floor.” Additionally, Taylor said the front door couldn’t close because its bottom hinge was broken. 
According to Taylor and her roommate, Kwayera Burrows, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, their First Choice leasing agent said they couldn’t take an in-person tour of the building until they officially agreed to rent, but he eventually agreed to send them a video of a “comparable” apartment. Both students told the Daily Trojan that they felt that the agent used the video to trick them into thinking the place was nicer than it actually was. 
“The [apartment] in the video was fully renovated,” Taylor said. “The apartment we were in looked like it had not had updates … It honestly was pretty neglected, like nobody had been taking care of it for who knows how long.” 
Another USC student renting from First Choice spoke to the Daily Trojan on the condition of anonymity, out of fear they would face retaliation from the owners of their building. 
The student, who lives in a First Choice apartment complex on 1238 West Adams Blvd., said they found several items in their apartment that needed repairs and a “colony of ants” in their bathroom the day they moved in. 
The student also provided a video  to the Daily Trojan from earlier in the year, when a tenant in their building took a shower and the water started “pouring” through the floor into the apartment below. 
“This happened at night, so there really was a big problem there,” they said. “We managed to get an emergency person on call … and they came and shut the water off because that’s all they can do at night. So then, that was another day without water.”
Taylor and Burrows also said that, outside of the video, they felt the owners from First Choice were “taking advantage” of their “inexperience” with renting. 
“The whole leasing situation is still very new to me and my roommates,” Burrows said. “We know that we have rights, but we don’t necessarily know what they are. I just feel like it’s really easy for them to scam us.”
Both Taylor and Burrows said, when they first spoke to the leasing agent, the agent said they would give away the apartment they were interested in to another group if they didn’t sign the lease immediately.
Ishani also said she felt the representatives from First Choice “played on” the fact that she was “somebody who had never been to the States” to pressure her into signing her lease. 
“We were talking to First Choice Housing, and we told them, ‘We need some time,’ and they were like, ‘You have time until tonight or tomorrow, and if you guys do not put in a deposit, we will not give you the unit. It will be assigned to someone else,’” Ishani said. “They did not give us time to think, so this was a very desperate type of distressed decision.” 
The day after Burrows, Taylor and their third roommate saw what their apartment looked like, they canceled their lease with First Choice and moved into a different complex. 
Ishani also plan to leave her apartment at First Choice by December.  
First Choice Housing declined multiple interview requests with the Daily Trojan, including phone calls and in-person visits to the office.

No. 5 USC continues conference play as it faces third-place Pac-12 team Washington State, who has only lost once this season with a 4-1-1 record. The Trojans look to expand on their program record 11-game win streak as they start the second half of league fixtures atop of the standings. 
Entering its seventh game of Pac-12 play, USC has converted 24 goals, only allowed 5 goals in six games and holds a 6-0 conference record. At this point last year, the Trojans only scored and allowed 6 goals respectively while bearing a 2-3 record amid a tumultuous run.
USC captured its historical 11th consecutive win last Thursday in a gritty bout against Oregon. The Trojans’ previous unbeaten streak occurred in 2016 en route to their most recent NCAA title, when they maintained a 10-game winning streak at the beginning of the season. 
“We’re not thinking about the games that have already been won,” said Head Coach Keidane McAlpine in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re only thinking about the one that is right in front of us. Washington State is an extremely good team, especially at home … they are a big challenge ahead of us.”
Despite the 3-1 defeat, Oregon created obstacles for the Trojans’ defense, as they created 12 shot attempts in the second half compared to USC’s six. Senior goalkeeper Anna Smith pitched in six pivotal saves in the second half to prevent further scoring from Oregon’s offense. Junior midfielder Croix Bethune’s goal from the penalty spot and freshman Simone Jackson’s late heroics in the second half cemented the victory for USC. 
“I think the [Oregon] game was a really good game to experience,” McAlpine said. “Oregon changed tactics in the game … However, we were still resilient enough to make enough plays on both ends of the field to get the result, and I think it prepares us for what teams are tactically going to try to do to us. I thought the game was extremely important, extremely necessary.” 
Washington State will return to its home field after a double overtime 2-2 draw against Arizona State last Friday despite leading the match 2-0 in the first half. The Cougars took their sole conference loss at home to Stanford Oct. 7 despite only created 1 less shot compared to Stanford. Washington State has notched 9 goals in conference play so far and has only allowed 3 goals, culminating in four clean sheets in six Pac-12 matches. 
“I think [Washington State is] going to play to their strengths,” McAlpine said. “We are going to have to play a complete game from end to end in order to keep things under control and we are going to have to take moments to settle the game.” 
The Trojans sit at the top of the Pac-12 standings with 18 points, ahead of crosstown rival UCLA who sits in second place with 14 points, followed by Washington State and Stanford who are tied with 13 points. USC is the only team left without a loss or draw in Pac-12 play. 
USC will face off against Washington State Thursday at 7 p.m. in Pullman, Wash.

The film circuit is up-and-running, with in-person festivals returning, movie theaters reopening and enigmatic trailers drawing our attention. On the cusp of daring October releases, such as Julia Ducournau’s body horror film “Titane” and Valdimar Jóhannsson’s supernatural thriller “Lamb,” moviegoers have more and more titles to stack up on their watchlists.
As the year comes to a close, here are a few highly-anticipated films coming to the silver screen that you should keep on your radar.
“Dune” — Oct. 22 
Timothée Chalamet leads this star-studded ensemble cast — which features Emmy-award winner Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista — in Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of “Dune.” Based on Frank Herbet’s science-fiction novel of the same name, this is “Dune’s” second cinematic adaptation, succeeding David Lynch’s 1984 version.
“Dune” follows Paul Atreides (Chalamet) as he ventures into an intergalactic quest on the planet Arrakis, otherwise known as Dune, a desert dwelling home to gargantuan sandworms and a sought-after resource named “spice.” As tensions stir over the control of spice, “Dune” unravels into a film exploring humanity and survival.
“The French Dispatch” — Oct. 22
Perhaps if you are unfamiliar with the movie, you’ll most likely remember when “The French Dispatch” cast got the meme treatment after a 2021 Cannes Film Festival photo of their varied attire, ranging from tropical vacation wear to punk apparel, went viral on social media.
“The French Dispatch,” dubbed as a “love letter to journalists,” is director Wes Anderson’s 10th film. It is an anthology of stories that takes place in the fictional French city of Ennui-Sur-Blasé, where viewers are placed within the story as if they were reading through a newspaper. 
 “Last Night In Soho” — Oct. 29 
Following his 2017 critically acclaimed film “Baby Driver,” Edgar Wright is finally back with “Last Night in Soho.” The film is an ominous psychological horror film starring Thomasin McKenzie as Eloise and Anya Taylor-Joy as Sandie opposite “Doctor Who” alumnus Matt Smith as Jack. Eloise, a young fashion student, miraculously finds herself in the body of Sandie and is thrusted into the 1960s as she adopts Sandie’s lifestyle and falls for Jack. 
With an element of social commentary, as Wright cites his influence to be a subgenre of film from the 50s and 60s that punished young women who would come to the city to make it big, “Last Night in Soho” has the potential to be a great Halloween watch.
 “Eternals” — Nov. 5
Coming off of a triumphant 2021 awards season — including being the first woman of color to win the Oscar for best director — Chloé Zhao has been tapped by the Marvel Cinematic Universe to direct “Eternals.” 
Featuring Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, among others, “Eternals” begins where “Avengers: Endgame” ends. The titular Eternals are a group of superhumans tasked with protecting humanity from deviants, malevolent forces that risk to tear apart a world slowly mending back together. 
“Spencer” — Nov. 5 
In another rendition surrounding the life of the late Princess Diana, director Pablo Larraín cast Kristen Stewart as his leading lady. “Spencer” is a newfound attempt to shift Stewart from her “Twilight” past and instead transform her into what could be an Oscar-winning performance. 
The film takes place in 1991 during a Christmas holiday celebration at the Sandringham Castle Estate in Norfolk, England. “Spencer” aims to tackle what could have happened during those few days that ultimately leads to the film’s simple, yet captivating plot: Princess Diana’s decision to divorce Prince Charles.
“House of Gucci” — Nov. 24
Although Lady Gaga has a song named after Versace heiress Donatella, she’s taking on another luxury fashion estate in Ridley Scott’s “House of Gucci.” Gaga will play the role of Patrizia Reggiani, who is infamously known for arranging her ex-husband Maurizio Gucci’s assassination.
“House of Gucci” will follow the fashion house’s rise and how a volatile marriage led to a murder, resulting in the aftermath forever impacting a family’s legacy. 
“Spider-Man: No Way Home” — Dec. 17
The rumors, predictions, fake spoilers and endearing cast of “Spider-Man: No Way Home” has made it an eagerly-awaited film in the MCU’s phase four. On the heels of the cliffhanger “Spider-Man: Far From Home” left fans with in 2019 and the post-credits scene from the recently released “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” that indicated that Tom Hardy’s Venom would be entering the MCU, there has been much buzz about the third installment of Tom Holland’s “Spider-Man”.
For fans of “Doctor Strange” and the newly emerging multiverse, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” will be a must-watch. The film is set to merge characters from various points, all surrounding the central question of what Peter Parker will do now that his identity has been uncovered.

Mexican regional mariachi and classic American pop are genres rarely associated with one another, except in the case of sophomore and singer-songwriter Alondra Santos. Santos, with her history as a mariachi performer and her love for pop music, hopes to one day create her own distinct style of music that can perfectly encapsulate both genres. 
Santos was born in El Monte, Calif. and raised in both South Jordan, Utah and South Central. Santos began singing at the age of two and said her family influenced her and the music she sang. 
“My grandma on my mother’s side introduced me to regional Mexican music and artists like Selena Quintanilla and Rocío Dúrcal, the classics, and that’s how I started,” Santos said. 
Santos began performing mariachi on television at the age of nine and made her debut with the show “Tengo Talento, Mucho Talento.” She then went on to participate in “La Voz Kids,” “Sábado Gigante,” “America’s Got Talent,” “La Voz… México” and is currently participating again in “Tengo Talento, Mucho Talento.”
“I started doing more and more shows and then came AGT, and I mean, honestly, each show is super unique. The experience is unbelievable,” Santos said. “You form amazing bonds and friendships, and you get to meet new people and get to go to places you never thought you would be at. I never thought I would be singing at Radio City Music Hall at 13 years old.”
Because of Santos’ history as an artist on television, she gained popularity and a following at a young age. This following allowed her to sing on major platforms and even at the White House’s Cinco de Mayo celebration at age 14. Santos performed a hour and half long set of classic mariachi songs including “Cucurrucucú Paloma,” “Aires del Mayab” and “La Charreada.” 
“It was all regional Mexican music, all mariachi,” Santos said. “I met the President [Obama] and I met the former Vice President [Biden] … in the Oval Office. That was a wild experience, and I didn’t think I was going to do that.”
Santos cited music — especially mariachi — as one of the primary ways she stays connected to her Mexican roots, but she feels heartbroken to see the genre falling behind.
“It’s a beautiful genre that, unfortunately now I feel like is dying out,” Santos said. “There’s not a lot of artists that represent the genre as they did back in the day. If we think about popular music, even in Spanish, it’s pop music or R&B in Spanish. It’s definitely underrated.” 
Being a mariachi singer, Santos wants nothing more than to help bring the renaissance of mariachi to the forefront. From adding “little flips and little melismas in the weirdest places,” Santos tries her best to honor and celebrate heritage in all the music she creates. She also said that she often tries to mesh genres like mariachi, pop and R&B to create her own style. 
“In a mariachi song, I want to add flips and melismas. But that’s not mariachi,” Santos said. “A lot of people are not used to hearing that, but you know I want the music and sound to still be authentic, but I like to add my own little spice to it.” 
Santos is currently majoring in vocal arts performance at the Thornton School of Music and is learning how best to train her voice and perfect her own sound. Being bilingual and having a large knowledge of traditional Mexican music allows Santos to fully explore more than one discipline of performance. 
“Alondra has the Spanish language at her beck and call, and we have been able to explore a lot of Spanish classical songs with her because of the language that is just such a part of her,” said Elizabeth Hynes, associate professor of vocal arts and Santos’ individual voice instructor. “I’ve had a lot of students that have had beautiful voices through all the years that I’ve taught here, but it’s much rarer to have somebody who actually will communicate a text and will understand a text to communicate it as an actress, and Alondra has that talent.”
Hynes and Santos meet one-on-one for one hour a week and have established a close student-mentor relationship. Hynes’ current goal with Santos is to continue refining her voice and teach her voice habits that will keep her voice healthy for a long time. While Hynes hasn’t necessarily studied or sung traditional Mexican music herself, she has adapted her curriculum with Santos to focus also on Mexican classical composers and songs. 
“These texts are very rich. They’re passionate and all about love and betrayal.” Hynes said. “The interesting thing about Alondra is that I usually am not able to assign that repertoire in the freshman year. But because she had that language ability, I was able to do it. It really is based on the fact she has that language as a bilingual speaker.” 
Besides being a confident and vivacious mariachi singer Santos, is an adored friend and a colleague people can trust and rely on to have deep conversations. 
“[Santos] has been a really great friend and also another great Latinx colleague to have especially at a predominantly white institution and a predominantly white school — Thornton in USC,” said Emmanuel Yoque, one of Santos’ friends and a sophomore majoring in vocal arts performance. “It’s been great because we can relate to [the same] struggles and language. It’s just really great having her as a friend.” 
Santos is currently working on new projects and plans to release a single titled “Te Di Mi Vida,” produced by David Pena, as early as November.

USC Village used to be a place where the surrounding South Central community could grocery shop, eat and spend time with friends or family. However, since its renovation in 2017, USC Village has become a place that primarily serves students and alienates the low-income community it used to serve. 
Before USC Village had a Trader Joe’s and Target, there was a Superior Grocers, where many community members would shop for their groceries. I remember going there as a kid with my mom because it was convenient and affordable. I used to see my community at USC Village, but when I go there with my family now, we sense that the space is not meant for us. We feel like visitors in a place that used to belong to us. 
The truth is USC Village isn’t meant to be a space for the community anymore and the Trader Joe’s is one of the biggest indicators. There are about 15 Trader Joe’s in Los Angeles and its surrounding cities, but there is only one in South Central, and it’s in USC Village. 
Trader Joe many locations outside of low-income neighborhoods speaks volumes about whom it defines as its customer base. Superior Grocers is far different from Trader Joe’s. 
Superior Grocers, which has many locations in South Central, makes serving neglected communities its priority. Not only was Superior Grocers cheaper, but it also took up the space now shared by Trader Joe’s and Target, which both clearly serve higher-income students — a majority of USC’s student population. 
When you live in a low-income neighborhood and see a Trader Joe’s or a Whole Foods, it means one thing: gentrification. And, USC Village has been one of the University’s largest gentrification projects. 
USC Village is very convenient for students and staff alike, so complete destruction is not expected. However, there are small ways in which USC can make USC Village a more inclusive space. 
For example, USC currently hosts an Arts Performance series where musicians and artists come to showcase their craft in USC Village. This is a good thing and it should continue, but what if USC Village expanded the scope of the events it hosts? 
USC Village plans to host a Día De Los Muertos celebration on Nov. 6, which will feature dance performances from a variety of regions in Mexico. The event is from 3 to 6 p.m., which seems awfully short. The advertisement promotes the restaurants within USC Village, but USC Village could invite local vendors onto the grounds to sell authentic Mexican food, such as pan de muerto or champurrado, which are two typical foods from Day of the Dead celebrations. 
However, USC should also make more of an effort to include the surrounding community throughout the entire year and not just during celebrations. At the beginning of this semester, I remember seeing a man selling sliced fruit across the street from USC Village, which should make space for vendors, such as that man, because it would invite the community and deconstruct the space for small business owners to thrive. 
Additionally, USC can make it more apparent that USC Village’s Great Lawn is also open to community members who want to have picnics or play sports. The 32nd Street USC Magnet School would particularly benefit from using this lot. 
I often see their students in physical education class on the small green spaces on University Avenue — a space that is not adequate for physical education. USC Village’s green space is large enough, and it would allow these kids to explore a variety of sports and activities. It’s only a walk away from 32nd St., and sharing this space with kids who live in South Central would be the first step in reconstructing the image USC Village once had. 
Google defines a village as “a self-contained district or community within a town or city, regarded as having features characteristic of village life.” USC Village is a self-contained district, but it isn’t a community. Through these small changes and collaboration with organizations that are dedicated to helping the people of South Central, USC Village can become a community that lives up to its name.

As 2021’s spooky season approaches, so does the opportunity to dress up, show out and be whatever you want to be for one night.
However, this nationally adored day is plagued with covert racism. It is overwhelmingly clear that the line between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation blurs over time. Our failure to acknowledge cultural appropriation in Halloween costumes — especially stereotypically popularized costumes — is harmful to various communities and cultures globally, as many aspects of some costumes are delicate and powerful symbols of these heritages. 
Today, people commonly misconstrue the difference between cultural appreciation and appropriation. Cultural appreciation comes with a desire to learn and understand another culture when invited by the other culture. According to Greenheart International, people practice cultural appreciation “in an effort to broaden their perspective and connect with others cross-culturally,” which usually happens when a marginalized culture invites others into its cultural traditions.
For example, Adele posted a photo of herself at the Notting Hill Carnival, a traditional celebration of Black and Caribbean culture, where she wore Bantu knots in her hair and a Jamaican flag printed on her top. The internet quickly showered her post with claims of cultural appropriation, whereas many Jamaican people saw the post as support for Jamaican culture, claiming: “To all the ignorant non-Jamaicans dragging Adele for supporting the Jamaican culture, sit down! You don’t speak for us!” 
Appreciation doesn’t simply mean learning more about another culture — the distinction also lies within what the in-group has to say. 
Cultural appropriation, however, occurs when someone pinpoints a part of someone else’s culture that may be personally advantageous. They then use it to their personal advantage without creating a bridge or learning about the significance of that particular cultural aspect. 
Moreover, cultural appropriation may occur between any groups of people, including various marginalized groups, or dominant groups stealing from marginalized cultures. Although the latter tends to be excused because of the tangled power dynamics, it is still very common. 
For example, hair bias in the workplace has been an ongoing issue for Black women especially, which prevents them from comfortably securing work opportunities and pressures them to change their hair. However, while Black women face commentary depicting their hair as “unprofessional” and “tacky,” white women who wear these styles from Black culture — cornrows for example — are seen as “trendy and innovative.” 
Cultural appropriation takes the front stage on Halloween in comparison to its appreciative counterpart, and these disrespectful acts deserve exhaustive critique. 
For example, the Indigenous community continually fights against the representation of their people as costumes. Just two years ago, a Halloween store in Phoenix, Ariz., sold “Sexy Native American” costumes — a disgusting and dehumanizing label to plaster onto a group of women and a definitive case of appropriating someone else’s culture for profit.
Additionally, every Halloween sees a disturbing number of “Terrorist Costumes” decked in a thobe and keffiyeh, or “Mexican Costumes” decorated in fake mustaches and sombreros. People go as far as to paint their faces in different tones, such as “Black Face,” a practice used to mock enslaved Black people nearly 200 years ago. It should go without saying that the act of doing this is a deeply painful thing for any Black person to witness. 
People choose to cherry-pick the most stereotypical extreme of a certain cultural group and exploit it to its comical and entertaining limits. Unfortunately, this behavior rarely manages to appropriately account for any adequate boundaries and simply epitomizes ignorance. 
The issue here is clear: Halloween’s alluring facade hides racism. When people masquerade as a “Sexy Native American,” they strip a group of people’s hundreds of thousands of years of history, torment, identity and culture. However, raising awareness for cultural appropriation during Halloween does not mean that we should subject every costume to immediate scrutiny. The line between appreciation and appropriation still exists. It is also essential to consider the spread of misinformation and Americans’ lack of general knowledge regarding international cultural traditions, values and people. 
This failure to consider potential cultural appropriation does not mean there is no room to grow. The purpose of this piece, and any open dialogue regarding cultural appropriation, is to open room for clear lines of communication. Unsure of the meaning of a certain piece of jewelry? Style of hair? Educate yourself and conduct a Google search. It is not others’ responsibility to educate you: learn, grow and appreciate. 
While Halloween shopping this year, think twice about your costume. It helps to truly step back to examine its significance and effect on others.
