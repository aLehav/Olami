USC’s defensive coaching staff has seen plenty of turnover from last season: Cornerbacks coach Donte Williams, who spoke to the media in a virtual press conference Wednesday, safeties coach Craig Naivar and defensive coordinator Todd Orlando are all new additions to the Trojans’ staff.
Coupled with the talent on USC’s roster — including cornerbacks sophomore Chris Steele and junior Olaijah Griffin, both of whom also joined the press conference Wednesday — the Trojans believe they have a formula that can turn heads. 
“I feel like we definitely don’t have the respect that we want, so we’re definitely embracing that challenge,” Steele said. “We’re ready to show the whole Pac-12 that we’re the best DB school in the country.”
Physical, competitive practices
Steele and Griffin both said they’ve felt the effects of USC’s new coaching staff in practice as the team gears up for its Nov. 7 season opener against Arizona State.
“Last year, we weren’t really physical [in practice], so we didn’t really get the feel of hitting,” Griffin said. “Now, just getting the feel of the physicality in practice, going against each other, it’s just helping us.”
Williams said the competitiveness of USC’s secondary group has stood out in practice, praising both Steele and Griffin as well as cornerbacks sophomores Dorian Hewett, Jayden Williams, redshirt sophomore Isaac Taylor-Stuart and redshirt freshman Adonis Otey for their improvements in fall camp.
USC coaches have spoken about the importance of depth at every position group this season, and the secondary is no exception. Williams said it’s why the practices have been so competitive.
“Every day is a competition. So I never believe in first-string, second-string — it’s an organizational depth chart. It’s always evolving,” Williams said. “If one of them stops practicing the way they need to practice for a day, they can get passed up. We have talented guys in that room.”
The anchors
Griffin and Steele are expected to be the focal points of the cornerback position for USC this year. Williams spoke on the presence and attitude that each brings to the table for the Trojans’ defensive unit. 
“[Griffin] likes the show … If you like the show, nobody wants to go to the show and get booed. So he’s gonna make sure that he puts his show on every week,” Williams said. “Chris is one of those guys that, he wants to show everybody — if there’s 22 people on the field at a time, playing 11-on-11, that he’s the baddest dude on the field.”
Williams’ impact on him and the rest of the secondary is not lost on Steele. 
“Having [Williams] is a true blessing for me,” Steele said. “Just having somebody on staff with us that really cares about his players the way he does, you could definitely tell the difference in the DB room this year.”
The scheme
Williams reaffirmed his commitment to the “boundary-field” style of play for his cornerbacks, in which certain “boundary” corners such as Steele line up on the short side of the field — for tighter, more physical coverage, typically against bigger wide receivers — while “field” corners such as Griffin will have more space to cover in the center of the field. 
Griffin said the system plays right into his skill set. 
“Out there, I’m on the whole island to myself,” he said. “And when I’m in that position, that’s when my confidence raises up and my talents go even higher.”
Steele said the boundary-field system will allow the two to work together even better, sharing in Griffin’s confidence and adding that the trust goes both ways.
“Especially me and OG, when we’re out there together, I think it suits us real well,” Steele said. “I definitely trust him on the backside and I know he trusts me on the boundaries, so it’s definitely been working out.”
High expectations
Williams had plenty of praise for the defensive coaching staff, applauding Orlando for “[allowing] coaches to coach” and referring to his relationship with Naivar as “like peanut butter and jelly.”
The cornerbacks coach, who comes to USC from Oregon and is recognized as the Pac-12’s best recruiter, said he’s conceded his “firecracker” role to Naivar and now coaches like more of a “Dr. Phil.”
“We feed off each other’s energy,” Williams said. “We still do a lot of things together as a collective [DBs] group.”
But at the end of the day, the players will be the ones who’ll make the final impact on the field for the Trojans. 
Both Steele and Griffin are ready for the challenge. 
“A lot of schools and a lot of people don’t think that USC is like a DB school, but I think we’re gonna change that to a new DBU,” Griffin said. “I believe that us as corners and them as safeties — we’re gonna take over the Pac-12.”

Asian Americans should be more angry. 
Or at least that is what USC professor Viet Thanh Nguyen thinks. 
“If we truly understood our history, and if we understood our present, there’s a lot to be angry about,” Nguyen said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Anger taken in the wrong direction, too much anger — this can be negative, but anger in the right dose is positive because it tells you that you are awake and that you are aware that there are injustices out there that you should be angry about … and if you’re not angry at all, in any way, shape or form, then you are completely blind or numb to these injustices that exist.”
That anger and awareness likely played a crucial role in propelling Nguyen to his latest achievement: In late September, Nguyen joined the Pulitzer Prize Board, becoming the first Asian American member in its 103-year history. The Pulitzer Prize is one of the most prestigious literary awards in the world and its board presides over the judging process that determines the award’s winners and finalists. Nguyen will serve a three-year term that’s renewable twice for up to nine years.
Despite the trailblazing nature of his new position, Nguyen does not think that the honor itself is cause for satisfaction. Instead, Nguyen hopes that his new position will help tear down entrenched barriers to representation. He hopes his distinction as the only Asian American on the board doesn’t force him to be its metaphoric gatekeeper of all things Asian American, a role he wholeheartedly rejects. 
“We have to do more than simply ask for representation or demand representation. We also have to change these systems, so that there is more — more access, more opportunity for different peoples — and we have to try to make sure that these institutions don’t have just one person of a certain background, but that they have many,” Nguyen said. “I’m not interested in being the only Asian American on the Pulitzer board, I’m not really interested in being the only one of my kind wherever I am. I’m committed to drawing attention to the fact that we need to throw open the gates altogether not to have a gatekeeper as the [only] representative.”
Long before Nguyen ascended to the heights he’s reached over the course of his career — heights that also include Aerol Arnold Chair of English at USC, contributing writer for The New York Times, recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship (more commonly known as the “Genius Grant”) and a Pulitzer Prize for his novel, The Sympathizer, Nguyen was a child growing up in San Jose as the son of Vietnamese refugees that fled the Vietnam War in 1975 when Nguyen was only 4 years old. 
Nguyen’s upbringing in San Jose might best be described by juxtapositions. On the one hand, Nguyen’s parents lived the American dream. After settling in San Jose and working at a friend’s grocery store, Nguyen’s parents opened one of the first Vietnamese grocery stores in the city and flourished. On the other hand, Nguyen’s parents worked 12-14 hour days at the store in a very dangerous environment — one in which they were both shot and wounded during an armed robbery — and many members of the family, including Nguyen himself, still bear traumatic scars from their shared experiences of war and dislocation.
In a similar vein, even though their local community was relatively diverse, it was still predominantly white, and Nguyen still felt an acute sense of otherness. 
“Regardless of how multicultural the neighborhood was, I was still an American,” Nguyen said. “And like all Americans, I was attuned into popular culture, which meant I was exposed to radio and TV and movies in which Asians and Asian Americans were cast as ‘the other.’ They were either racially stigmatized or silenced or not even present.”
That sense of otherness extended to Nguyen’s high school experience. In a predominantly white school with predominantly white teachers and a euro-centric curriculum, Nguyen and his fellow Asian American classmates would gather in a corner of campus every day out of an instinct for self-protection and belonging. Ultimately, it would be at Berkeley where Nguyen would finally find the language to understand and articulate his otherness. 
While an undergraduate at Berkeley, Nguyen took courses in Asian American studies and Asian American literature that revealed to him an American history of systemic anti-Asian oppression. In Nguyen’s words, it was a radicalizing experience. 
“To be radicalized really meant to understand simply what had happened to Asians and Asian Americans,” Nguyen said. “And if that is radicalization, then I hope everybody becomes radicalized because if you don’t know these things, in fact, what has happened is that you have been deprived of the knowledge of your own existence. So that’s what happened at Berkeley.”
Nguyen went on to earn his Ph.D. in English from Berkeley. The rest is history. 
Six books and 23 years later, it’s clear that the radicalization he underwent at Berkeley didn’t just end with him but has rubbed off on some of his students as well. 
Christine Nguyen is a junior at USC majoring in political science and business law. She was introduced to Nguyen by a fellow student and now manages the professor’s social media accounts. 
“I would definitely say that working for professor Viet has changed my identity one thousand percent — like a total change,” Christine said. “I grew up very ignorant of my identity because I went to a predominantly white high school and had a predominantly white group of friends and so it was hard for me to identify and be proud of my culture … so working for professor Viet [provided me] with a lot of academic, historical and political background to why I am the way I am and it has allowed me to take power and ownership of my identity.” 
It is no secret that academia is a predominantly white institution. So when Nguyen lectured as a guest speaker during one of Christine’s classes, the effect was profound. 
“You don’t realize the nuances of individual identity until you see people that struggle similarly to you; in my own upbringing I didn’t see anyone in academia like Professor Nguyen before,” Christine said. “When he came to speak in one of my classes he was talking about his struggle of success and how memory politics played into his own individual career and I was like ‘Wait, that kind of sounds a little bit familiar to me’ … it causes you to reevaluate the trajectory of your career goals and it’s more nuanced than the one-size-fits-all standard that we see in popular culture.”
Tommy Nguyen, a junior majoring in History and International Relations, took Nguyen’s class, AMST 150: The American War in Vietnam, after reading the professor’s 2018 Time Magazine cover story, ‘I Love America. That’s Why I Have to Tell the Truth About It.’ At the end of the semester, Tommy was recommended by the class TA to become Nguyen’s research assistant. 
“Professor Viet Nguyen taught me to be angry at different things and to change my anger in different ways,” Tommy said. “Reading The Sympathizer and learning from him has shown me things from different perspectives to help me realize who caused the [Vietnam] War and who were the real villains and who were the real heroes … a lot of the history that we learn [with Nguyen] isn’t just a Vietnamese history, American history or Cambodian history, it’s a human history of us.”
With his highly anticipated sequel to The Sympathizer set to hit shelves next year, Nguyen shared some advice for aspiring writers. 
“If you are coming from a background outside of [the majority] as some kind of disempowered, marginalized, minority population, you may feel the pressure to explain yourself and your culture, to translate yourself, your languages, your customs, and so on and so forth — this is something that must be absolutely resisted by any writer,” Nguyen said. “When I say write like a majority, I don’t mean like a white person, I mean write as if we ourselves are speaking to ourselves, and let everyone else catch up. That’s where you get interesting art, and even hopefully, great art, to come from.”
Given Nguyen’s literary stature, it is likely that much will continue to be made about his significance to the Asian American community. However, Nguyen wants his readers to remember that he is no spokesperson. 
“Every time I go and say something in public, I usually try to include some kind of statement to the effect of which ‘I’m not a voice for the voiceless, I’m not a spokesperson,’” Nguyen said. 
“I think it’s crucial for all of us to speak out and to be heard, and then if we are somehow successful at it, it’s absolutely crucial for us to say that we are not the spokespeople and not the voices for the voiceless. Our real commitment should not be to be voices for the voiceless, our real commitment should be to abolish the conditions of voicelessness. That’s the true act of justice.”

“Are you registered to vote?”
I exit out of the Instagram advertisement as I resist the urge to throw my phone against a wall. Yes, Instagram, I actually already voted. Leave me alone, please. This is one instance of how voting culture has infiltrated pop culture and my personal life. 
It has morphed from a movement to incentivize voter turnout into an aggressive game of gaslighting and bullying. Don’t be stupid and waste your vote on a third-party candidate, vote for Joe Biden! For the record, there are people who just do not like to get involved in politics — they might as well wear T-shirts that emblazon, “The outcome of the election will not affect me in any sense whatsoever, so I do not care enough to vote” across the torso. 
However, there are also people who are disenfranchised, people who are incarcerated and people who simply do not want to participate in a “democracy” that has oppressed them for thousands of years. This liberal rhetoric of “Just vote!” becomes problematic when it completely undermines the roadblocks that prevent people from being able to vote in the first place. Voting culture exposes our faux democracy — solely relying on voter turnout is not the solution to improving it. 
As detailed in an op-ed published by Jacobin, a U.S. socialist magazine, liberals’ infatuation with the magical fantasy world of Harry Potter segues into politics. “‘Magic,’ as it is discussed in the Harry Potter universe, is a force that allows its wielder to have a profound and measurable impact without organizing, sacrificing or indeed doing much of anything.” As a result, I refer to the cohort of liberals who brand voting as the answer to all contemporary political turmoil as “Harry Potter liberals,” or HPLs.   
HPLs will relentlessly encourage their followers to vote but make no efforts to advocate for those who are blocked from voting or who face insidious voter suppression tactics at the hands of the administration. For instance, early voting records are being shattered across the nation and that speaks volumes toward the significance of this election. However, voters in states such as Texas and Georgia are waiting in lines for two to eight hours.  
In fact, according to an analysis by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica, two-thirds of Georgia polling places that had to stay open late during the June primaries were in majority-Black neighborhoods, despite making up only about one-third of the state’s total polling places. Furthermore, in a study led by economist Keith Chen at the University of California, Los Angeles, voters in predominantly Black neighborhoods waited 29% longer than those in white neighborhoods during the 2016 elections. 
Not to mention the fact that Republican lawmakers such as Sen. Ted Cruz denounce the notion that people who are incarcerated have the right to vote. During Amy Coney Barrett’s Wednesday Senate confirmation hearing, Cruz claimed, “One of our colleagues, Sen. Sanders of Vermont, over the course of the Democratic presidential primaries, argued not just felons who are out of jail, he argued that felons in jail, literally Charles Manson, serving a life sentence — or I think multiple life sentences for murder — should be able to vote.” 
Ironically, Manson died in 2017. Cruz admitted he didn’t know that in a tweet, but he continued his tirade that Democrats only want people who are incarcerated to vote because they will be a Democrat voter and enhance the party’s prospects on Election Day. However, whether incarcerated people vote according to Democrats’ interest or not, Cruz’s rhetoric stems from a flawed generalization that labels the opposing party as “criminals,” only to function as a scapegoat to disenfranchise the rights of American people. 
Additionally, Florida election officials are taking steps to remove formerly convicted people from voter rolls if they have outstanding court debts. This issue extends to the racist system of mass incarceration in America, which is a much broader conversation, but think about it: If you were formerly incarcerated for a minor drug crime and cannot find employment because you have a criminal record, Florida wants to revoke your voting rights because you are poor. Rooted in decades of exclusionary practices, these policies strip people of their rights with the facade of being fair. 
Millions of people want to exercise their right to vote but physically cannot. Where is the outrage over this? Where is the advocacy beyond Instagram posts about the importance of voting, contributing to democracy and kicking the Cheeto out of office? This is where the term “Harry Potter liberal” becomes significant — this issue of blatant disfranchisement will not mend itself, but HPLs act like it will. 
Ultimately, I am not writing this to tell anyone how they need to vote. Our democracy and the electoral college is corrupt — a study released by the National Bureau of Economic research found that the electoral college favors 65% of future Republican candidates. However, I believe there is a way to dismantle the system, which will be even less feasible under another four years of a fascist Trump presidency. We must remember that defeating Trump will not fix the system like magic. We simply cannot afford to not be pragmatic.

I associate every year of high school with a social movement. When I think of freshman year, I see the pink beanies with cat ears that everyone wore to the Women’s March following Donald Trump’s election. In my sophomore year, I marched down to Washington Square Park with so many other New York City teenagers and demanded gun control laws after recent school shootings. Junior year was marked by metal straws and “Skolstrejk för klimatet” posters. And senior year, after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and so many others, the Black Lives Matter movement took off once again. 
But after four years of protesting for these various causes, very little change has been made. Right now, many of you might say to me that this inaction is because of our country’s current leadership. I wouldn’t disagree. But I think there’s more going on here. 
Activism is generally pretty formulaic. It is usually first ignited by outrage. Something bad happens, and people are upset. As a result, people take to the streets to protest for change. Either change occurs or it doesn’t, and eventually, we all settle back into our daily routines and the movement subsides. It’s hard to avoid this activism burnout, and every activist is susceptible to it. 
Generally, activists fight for immediate change. They protest for new laws to be passed and old systems to be restructured. But the more important (and less popular) side of activism is that which fights for gradual cultural change. We often disregard this side because it’s more subtle and indeed more difficult, but if more of us focused on it, the efforts of protesters wouldn’t feel so futile. Movements wouldn’t fade away when hashtags inevitably stopped trending on Twitter. 
As an artist, I’ve always thought of art as a tool to fix society rather than escape it. And here’s why: Since early childhood, our worldviews are formed mostly by lived experience, but many of us grow up sheltered from much of the world and may not experience it until we are adults. The arts and media generally fill the blanks that are left in our worldview. 
Our perception of things we haven’t experienced usually comes from movies, TV shows, books, etc. If we use them to promote the kind of society we want to live in, instead of the society that already exists, we can normalize the cultural change we want to see and wait for the real world to catch up. We have to push the perspectives that have been ignored for so long into the mainstream. 
I don’t necessarily mean that you have to give up your guilty pleasure I-just-got-home-and-need-to-relax television habits for heavy, dramatic, Oscar-winning social commentary. But we have to be more conscious of the art we consume. Entertainment and social consciousness are not mutually exclusive. Art should be both. Committing to cultural change means being quite a bit more thoughtful about what kind of art we choose to support. 
If you forgot the name of a character in the show you’re watching, could you describe them with the phrase “the ____ character” (substitute ____ for Black, Asian, gay, etc.)? Does it pass the Bechdel test (two named female characters talking about something other than a man)? Does it show women and people of color in powerful positions? If it doesn’t, then it’s on you to stop watching it. 
If we evolve our criteria for what good art is to include social consciousness and diversity, we will be making the first step toward achieving a cultural shift. Find media that shows a new perspective or normalizes a cultural change and share it with your friends and family. Commit to consuming this type of media and push it into the mainstream. Use a fraction of the energy you have for activism to promote long-term change.

As USC football’s first game rapidly approaches, the running back corps will be one to watch during the season.
Running backs coach Mike Jinks spoke to the media Tuesday morning and emphasized this year’s group of backs is mentally and physically prepared for the expedited season. 
The Trojans rely on a powerful foursome of running backs, with seniors Stephen Carr and Vavae Malepaei along with sophomores Kenan Christon and Markese Stepp. According to Jinks, they all came into training camp in fantastic shape, calling them an “unbelievable group” with each earning reps for themselves. Jinks and head coach Clay Helton will look to get all of them involved. 
“We’ve looked at some multiple-back sets, and now we’re going to get our best players on the football field,” Jinks said. “[We have an] extremely talented running back room. We’re gonna find ways to get all those guys on the field.” 
Carr, who also spoke to the media Tuesday, will be an important asset to the Trojans’ potentially explosive Air Raid offense this year. Jinks had high praise for the senior running back.
“Stephen Carr looks great. He looks as good as he’s ever been since I’ve been here. He’s really just giving an example,” Jinks said. “And just from a mental standpoint, I think he’s focused and ready to take his game to another level, even beyond where it was when he got here as a highly touted freshman.”
As he begins his final year with the Trojans, Carr hopes to display his improvement at pass blocking and is ready to get the season going. 
“I just want to be more physical this year. That’s really the only thing on my mind,” Carr said. “I feel like the college world has seen a lot of what I could do when it comes to catching the ball out of the backfield [and] making people miss. I’m trying to show up a little more.” 
Head coach Clay Helton said Monday that Carr has been hitting holes harder in practice. 
Carr credited former Trojan and current Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Ronald Jones as a role model and someone he’s been studying. Alongside Jones, New Orleans Saints back Alvin Kamara is another player Carr has studied to learn how to better run through holes. 
“I will say some of it came from watching Ronald Jones … I would watch some of his clips before I go out to practice,” Carr said. “And the way he hits the hole is in stride, so I try to take after his game a little bit.”
It was a challenge for the backs to stay consistent during the offseason with the lack of clarity on when or if the season would begin. Carr said he had to get creative with training. 
He also mentioned that he and senior receiver Tyler Vaughns trained together throughout the offseason, helping them stay in great shape coming into fall camp. 
“I trained with Tyler Vaughns a whole lot,” Carr said. “Me and him tried to stay on schedule, and I got a couple of track workouts just to make sure my form is right.”
Helton has discussed the challenge of keeping players prepared with the risk of a coronavirus outbreak severely cutting down the roster at any moment. Jinks highlighted the same regarding the running backs. 
“This season, especially with some of the obstacles that we may potentially have to overcome,” Jinks said, “I’ve got seven [or] eight guys in my running back room right now and number eight has to be ready to play.” 
Arizona State, USC’s first opponent on Nov. 7, gave up an average of 125.5 rushing yards last season over 13 games, making the Sun Devils one of the toughest defenses in the Pac-12. Two of their top tacklers, junior linebacker Darien Butler and senior defensive back Evan Fields, will be back this season and attempt to contain the backs. 
This is where running back depth is so crucial for the Trojans. Jinks is confident all backs will be prepared and ready to go at any time.
Jinks also hopes the offense is going to be more fast-paced, similar to an Air Raid  scheme. At the same time, he hopes the backs will be more powerful.
“We want to be one-cut runners … we want to be violent when we have the football in our hand,” Jinks said. “We want to take it to our opponents and you do that by being more decisive.”

The time is now. The days are winding down ‘till Election Day, and it is our chance to be the change. Many people choose not to vote because they feel like their vote doesn’t matter or they know too little information about it. So I am here to tell you some reasons why you should vote and why I am voting in this upcoming election and future elections to come. 
Many have turned a blind eye toward terms such as systemic racism and intersectionality. Not everyone is given the same opportunities, just because of the color of their skin. This form of racism has been rooted as a normal way of life in our society throughout history, and it still exists. This is known as systemic racism.
This type of racism leads to discrimination for people of color in many different aspects such as difficulty in being able to buy a house, getting a great education and employment. We all have multiple identities that make us different, and for people of color, their identity can oftentimes lead to discrimination. Even people that may identify differently in gender, sex or religion face discrimination as well. This is intersectional discrimination. 
If you are not familiar with intersectionality, it can best be explained as the connection of disadvantaged groups such as race, class, gender identity and religion and how these identities may overlap for an individual. Being a female student-athlete of color, I am faced with identities that could hinder me from so many opportunities, and it is one of the many reasons that I am voting. 
Not everyone’s history is taught in the classroom. When learning about the history of minority populations, you might have to go out of your way to find it because it is not always easily accessible. What many people don’t know is that the 15th Amendment granted voting rights to African American men in 1870, but women were not included in this. Despite this amendment, discriminatory acts still continued to prevent Black people from exercising their right to vote. Things such as literacy tests, poll taxes and grandfather clauses prevented Black citizens from even being able to have the opportunity.
However, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed the legal barriers state and local leaders used to deny African Americans their right to vote under the 15th Amendment. The 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote. It was ratified in August of 1920. This amendment helped women get closer to equality in several ways. This amendment, sure enough, did not include Black women until about five decades later and was selective to voting rights for white American women. 
Women fought for many things such as job opportunities, education and fair wages. Women began to vote and run for office in an effort to improve government as well as their own personal lives. Both groups struggled and fought so hard to be given this equal opportunity. This gives me even more motivation to vote and the desire to express to others the value of exercising your right to vote. 
Voting is an opportunity that is given, so why not take advantage of it? Voting not only gives us the power to voice our opinions, but it is a way to amplify them. Not voting is simply letting someone else make a decision for you and wasting an opportunity. Voting goes way beyond who will be president: There are so many more areas we impact through our votes such as housing, education and health care. 
Voting is our way of determining our quality of life and setting the stage for future generations to come. Don’t wait to vote and make sure you take the time to research the candidates and what they believe!
