According to a study released last month by CNBC, USC ranks 7th out of all colleges and universities nationally in average student debt.
CNBC estimates that the average USC graduate carries the burden of having to repay $36,787. The total student debt of USC is $631.5 million, ranked behind University of Phoenix, which is ranked 1st in the nation for the highest total student debt at $4.96 billion. CNBC received the statistics from the U.S. Department of Education.
Going to USC might break your piggy bank
“My family and I find it really hard to pay for school,” said Tona Elizarraraz, a freshman majoring in theatre. “If it weren’t for some outside scholarships, going here wouldn’t even be a possibility.”
A U.S. News and World Report article published in 2009 concluded that high tuition stems mainly from universities entering a “bidding war for top faculty and better services for students.”
“The reason USC ranks so high in numbers of student loans is because of the size of our student body and the number of professional graduate programs, where it is customary to borrow the entire cost of attendance,” wrote Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning, in an e-mail.
Some students regret paying a high price tag for higher education.
“I didn’t think the education was worth it,” said James Xie, a senior majoring in communications. “I could be graduating a semester earlier, that’s 20-grand right there.”
Despite the high cost of attending USC, more than 60 percent of students receive some type of financial assistance, whether in the form of scholarships or loans.
For some students, the benefits of graduation from USC outweigh the downsides.
“I expected [to graduate with debt],” Elizarraraz said. “It makes me really sad, but I believe that our education is an investment for our futures. If we don’t invest in ourselves, what can we invest in?”
I forgot to mention–Edward, you’re an idiot.
I’m one of those USC graduates carrying a significant debt load.  I’m a bit worried, as I haven’t found a full time job yet since graduating last May.  Luckily I have some pretty good family support.  I have made some good professional connections while enrolled, and continue to talk to professors and receive mentorship (by no means is this typical–I was a creative writing major, and some of my work is being evaluated around L.A.).  But as the months wear on, I wonder whether it was worth it.  I know I’ll survive, and I knew going in there would be risks.  But geezus, what a terrible time to be $XX,000 in debt.
I lived in the area for a couple of years, SC that is, and it was intimidating but was not really harmed or came close to being harmed.
Thank you kevin
I think there is a simple explanation for this. The statistic is high because USC is a private school – essentially a private, not-for-profit corporation, where costs are paid entirely by direct tuition charges and endowment funds. Public schools, like UCLA, receive a large amount of state funding to operate, and can therefore charge less to (in-state) students. Now, there are plenty of small private colleges in the country, but not many as large as USC. I think NYU and Brigham Young are the only two private schools that are larger (and BYU has a different funding structure since it receives funding from the LDS church). Those small private colleges cost less to operate, but still saddle their students with high tuition (=debt). However, its not as high as at USC. Basically, USC operates with the same institutional expenses and structure as other large universities, but most other universities of this size are publicly-funded. So USC must pass the institutional costs of a large university directly on to students, rather then taxpayers. For example, I don’t think its that USC spends too much on public safety, its that at most other public universities, their DPS are essentially municipal police officers, city or state employees.
You got a link for that statistic, edward?
The reason that USC is so expensive is that it is located in a gang-infested area where the school has to protect itself with a police presence both on & off campus. Ever wonder what percentage of USC’s operations budget goes to Security & neighborhood give-aways (so they don’t riot or attack us)? 27%
Edward,
You are absolutely wrong!  As it happens to be, while the neighborhood may not be the “nicest,” it is by no means dangerous.  There was an article published a couple of days ago by the Daily Trojan (from a UCLA researcher) who noted that the gang elements around the campus do not touch SC.  It is a beacon of hope for the community.  That is why there is no graffitti on the campus or gang related activity within close proximity of students.  
As a matter of fact, you can check the statistics with the department of education which tracks criminal “incidents” on campus and compare it with most institutions.  You’ll find that SC is safer that Berkeley and near UCLA.  While UCLA happens to be located in one of the nicest areas in America, interesting that the crime rates on campus and immediatly near campus are close to the same.  Now once you get out of that immediate zone around campus things are much different.  
Please Trojan hater, go back to your hole

While 63.1 percent of adults in the United States are either overweight or obese according to the 2009 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, USC students are turning to physical education classes to be healthier.
About 2,100 students are enrolled in physical education courses this semester, which is a 250-student increase from fall 2010 and a 200-student increase from spring 2010, according to Steve VanKanegan, director of the physical education program.

“Students are choosing to explore physical education not just to round out their schedules, but because they recognize the importance of being active,” VanKanegan said.
He said he thinks the primary reason for the increase in the number of students enrolled in physical education classes is the quality of the instructors.
“Our instructors have a complete background in the subjects they teach,” VanKanegan said. “We’re not putting [instructors] in classes unless they have played, coached or had extensive experience [in that field].”
He said student desires to be healthier have been another driving force behind the department’s growth.
“Students are becoming more aware of the importance of health and well-being,” VanKanegan said.
Mackenzie Ross, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she enjoys taking physical education classes at USC because they motivate her to be healthy.
“Exercise is really important for being healthy and staying in shape,” Ross said. “Gym classes here are a fun and educational way to get into exercising and stay motivated.”
Some students find it difficult to set aside time to work out in between class and homework, so the physical education classes make students prioritize time to exercise.
“It’s really important to be healthy while you’re at school,” said Stephanie Guo, a sophomore majoring in communication. “I don’t think I’d have time to work out with the classes I’m taking, so putting it into my schedule really helps.”
Josue Enriquez, a senior majoring in civil engineering, said physical education courses are a great outlet for students to relieve stress.
“Taking [physical education] classes helps you de-stress from academic classes. I’ve taken many P.E. classes, [and] all the classes have been amazing,” Enriquez said.
The department has recently added new classes, including surfing and table tennis, to appeal to a wide variety of students. The surfing class, which was added in the fall, was filled on the first day of registration, according to VanKanegan.
The department is working to continue this growth by looking at the possibility of creating a minor in physical education, VanKanegan said. He said this minor would be attractive to students who are wishing to pursue a profession in physical therapy. So far, no steps have been taken to look further into the addition of the minor.
“We believe we’re going to continue to grow for years to come because we have a talented core group of instructors, and students are realizing the importance of good health,” VanKanegan said.

The North Area Neighborhood Development Council, an independent organization that plays a role in Los Angeles City’s decision making process, held a community forum meeting Thursday evening to discuss the USC Specific Plan and how it will impact jobs in the community.
Jobs · Chris Gallas from the WorkSource Center of South Los Angeles said his company will help community workers with mock interviews. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan 
The USC Specific Plan details the planned redevelopment of the University Village. Renovations will include new student housing, retail spaces, parking and other changes.
Members of NANDC attended along with representatives from local unions, the WorkSource Center of South Los Angeles and several community members. The meeting, which was the last of a series of economic development forums hosted by NANDC, focused on new developments in the area and how to maximize hiring community members who have difficulty finding jobs.
NANDC President Shawn Simons is currently drafting a proposal that will first have to be approved by the council before being presented to USC. She highlighted four main areas of focus for the council’s presentation to USC — economic development, housing, physical attributes and community resources.
“Economic development is the most important, because if we can get people in the community working with real jobs and real salaries, then we won’t have to worry so much about subsidized housing,” Simons said.
NANDC and community members hope USC will pursue a local community hiring initiative for the planned construction that will begin sometime this year to create jobs in an area with a high unemployment rate.
The unemployment rate in Los Angeles County in December was 12.7 percent, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Simons spoke about asking to hire at least 30 percent of the workers from the community within a two-mile radius of the construction projects.
She added, however, that with such a large undertaking, the council as well as the community would like for USC to make an even larger commitment to involving local workers in the execution of the redevelopment plans.
She added that they would like to see USC commit to a 15 percent local hiring rate within a five-mile radius with at least 10 percent of those workers being “at risk,” or those who have a prior incident such as jail time that might make it difficult for them to find work.
On top of construction, Simons said she would like to see a push toward more local hiring in permanent jobs once the new University Village is completed. She acknowledged that the new U.V. would likely have higher rent for retail spaces than the current one, and she stressed the need for assisting local small businesses currently operating out of the U.V.
Simons added that NANDC will try to help local businesses and workers throughout the redevelopment process with the help of other community resources, including workers unions and WorkSource, which is an organization committed to delivering workforce development and training services in the L.A. area.
Christopher Gallas, the representative from WorkSource of South Los Angeles, told the audience that the organization will offer help to the community through mock interviews and connections with local hiring businesses for community workers.
Jane Templin, a representative from the Los Angeles Local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union 11, was also in attendance and encouraged the local workers at the meeting to be active in their search for work throughout the construction process.
“What is important is that jobs are offered to premier pathways in our community,” Templin said. “I realize the whole country’s hurting right now, but I’m not as interested in having people coming from Texas and Arizona to take our jobs when we have skilled people that can be put into skilled positions here.”

This season, the USC women’s basketball team has shown an ability to defend its home court by any means necessary.
The Women of Troy (13-6, 5-3) have won high-scoring shootouts and defensive battles.

On Thursday, they overcame a slow start to beat Arizona 81-72.
The win, coupled with a loss by Arizona State, moved USC back into sole possession of third place in the conference.
Arizona (13-6, 4-4) dropped one game back in the conference race with the loss.
“After a tough weekend up north, I thought we rebounded and responded extremely well,” said USC coach Michael Cooper.  “I thought we did a good job of playing hard for 40 minutes.”
Early on, it looked like the Women of Troy might be suffering a hangover from their blowout loss last weekend to Stanford.
USC failed to generate much offense for most of the first half, although the team closed the half strong on a 16-7 run.
That spurt helped the Women of Troy take a 31-23 lead into the break, despite Wildcats guard Brooke Jackson banking in a three-pointer at the halftime buzzer.
“As long as we keep playing hard and hitting our shots those kind of [runs] happen,” said sophomore forward Christina Marinacci.
At halftime, junior guard Briana Gilbreath led the Women of Troy with 10 points and five rebounds.
As a team, USC shot just 40 percent from the floor, but held Arizona to 25 percent shooting in a half where the Wildcats had more turnovers (13) than field goals (7).
In the second half, both sides rebounded from their early offensive struggles.
USC went to freshman forward Cassie Harberts early and often to start the second half.
Harberts shot the ball on the Women of Troy’s first four possessions, converting three of those opportunities.
“Cassie makes herself very available down there,” Cooper said.  “She moves well and she knows where to be at.”
The outburst helped the Women of Troy stake a quick double-digit lead in the half, which they maintained for most of the second half.
Arizona did close the gap to 69-63 with three minutes remaining on a steal and breakaway layup by forward Ify Ibekwe, but the outcome was never seriously in doubt after the break.
“I think we relaxed a little bit more,” Gilbreath said.  “Things started opening up real wide for us.  We got easy layups, we ran the floor well, we had good [spacing] and the shots were there.”
Gilbreath continued to give the Women of Troy a little bit of everything, scoring a team-high 20 points and adding nine rebounds, five assists and two blocks.
Marinacci chipped in a season-high 17 points and just missed a double-double of her own with nine rebounds.
Up next for the Women of Troy is a home date on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. against Arizona, who played No. 10 UCLA tough on Thursday and sits just one game back in the standings.
“Every game from here on out is a big game for us,” Marinacci said.  “Especially playing at home because we want to keep this winning streak going.”

The USC women’s swim team travels to Northern California this weekend to take on No. 4 California and No. 1 Stanford in two highly anticipated dual meets.
The Women of Troy (8-0, 3-0) will face Cal today and Stanford on Saturday, with both meets scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.
Stiff challenge · In the span of two days, the Women of Troy, battling fatigue, will look to swim past two challenging top-five teams in California and Stanford that have proved problematic in previous years. - Daily Trojan file photo 
These meets against the two powerhouses have traditionally been very significant to USC swimmers, who have a bone to pick with the Golden Bears as well as the Cardinal.
“We haven’t beat Stanford’s women’s [team] in 14 to 15 years,” said USC coach Dave Salo. “So, we are up against two of the best teams in the country and we think we are one of them”
The No. 3 Women of Troy are aware that Cal and Stanford are not to be underestimated.
USC views the competitions this weekend as tools to make the team better.
“It’s probably best for us to go against the best competition we can,” Salo said. “It’s good for us to kind of fine tune. You can’t get lulled into confidence.”
When it comes to back-to-back meets, the lack of rest between competitions becomes problematic.
Last year, the Women of Troy defeated Cal in the first of the two dual meets, but were defeated by Stanford.
Exhaustion and lack of focus  might have caused the team’s loss last year, but the Women of Troy hope this year will be a different story.
“Last year, when we had these two meets, we focused so much on Cal that we lost to Stanford. We’re changing the strategy this year,” said senior co-captain Lyndsay DePaul.
The Women of Troy certainly have a challenge in store for them as they face two of the top swim teams in the Pac-10, both of which are also undefeated this season.
Salo, however, feels confident in his team.
“In the scheme of things, our women’s team has a chance to win the [NCAA] championship,” he said.
Senior co-captain Presley Bard also expressed her belief in the team’s ability to succeed in this weekend’s dual meets.
“Last year we had girls who could win events, but now we have girls who can win second, third and fourth,” Bard said. “We have people who can score, as well as win events.”

Following an impressive 3-0 start to kick off the season, the No. 2 USC men’s tennis team will host the ITA Kick-Off Weekend today at Marks Stadium, looking to build off its latest victory over Florida State.
Although Wednesday’s win over the Seminoles wasn’t seamless, the Trojans managed to finish the match with a decisive 6-1 victory, leaving them undefeated and serving a visiting Florida State team its first loss of the season.
The Men's Tennis Team will have a big weekend coming at Marks Stadium.
The weekend tournament will last two days, as USC welcomes Brigham Young, Indiana, and San Diego State to their home courts, looking to extend its winning streak.
As a result of the team’s strong start, junior Steve Johnson, among others, remains optimistic about the team’s performance, noting that the tournament will be a good time for the Trojans to continue to put their top-notch talent on display.
“Hopefully this weekend will be a good lineup, so that we can show people what our full lineup is like,” Johnson said.
Returning for USC Friday is senior Peter Lucassen, a welcome veteran who is expected to add championship experience to an already seasoned group.
“Peter [Lucassen] will be back and ready, which will be good for us,” Johnson said.
In the aftermath of an impressive performance against Florida State, freshman Ray Sarmiento remains aware of the team’s high-expectations, even as one of the team’s younger players.
When asked whether the pressure becomes a distraction or a mental difficulty, Sarmiento remained adamant that all the talk is actually inspirational and exciting.
“We welcome it and enjoy it,” Sarmiento said. “[You have to] take one match at a time, keep doing the right things and it’ll happen.”
The Trojans could, however, improve their doubles play, but the young freshman insists it will come in due time.
“Doubles has been a little more difficult, because there are so many players that can play with each other, so as the season goes on and the lineups become more solid, we’ll be more comfortable,” Sarmiento said.
This doubles versatility might be a testament to USC’s undeniable camaraderie, one that could serve as an asset in the long haul. 
“[The team support] is very important, since [tennis] is an individual sport,” Sarmiento said. “It helps when your teammates are supporting you, and it’s nice to have the coaches by your side.”
San Diego State is coming off a 7-0 win at their Aztec Winter Invite, while BYU and Indiana enter the tournament with .500 records. The Trojans played the Aztecs in 2010 preseason and won the match 7-0.
The two-day tournament begins today at 10 a.m. and goes into Saturday, with BYU and Indiana set to start play.

Earlier this week, a buddy of mine alerted me to the fact that seven of the eight Pac-10 softball teams are in the preseason top 25.
My first reaction was not one of admiration, but of disappointment that there are eight softball teams in the Pac-10.
Then, I realized that if USC did have a softball team, we would probably be pretty good.
Getting the best of the best from the softball teams of the PAC-10. 
I’m talking perennial top-five good. To borrow a line from the Saturday Night Live skit, “Superfans,” “I’m not talkin’ about a one-peat, two-peat or even a three-peat. That’s right, I’m talkin’ a minimum eight-peat.”
Warm weather, athletic girls and softball go together like the NCAA, Ohio State and Cam Newton.
Knowing that our softball team would be instantly grabbing headlines (there are at least 20 Jennie Finches on campus), I thought that if I was appointed Athletic Director for a day, one of my first tasks would be to make softball a Division-I sport at USC provided that all parameters (Title IX, field space, etc.) were disregarded in the same way UCLA football coach Rick Neuheisel disregards winning.
Then I got to thinking — with that clause, what else would I do?
I would name every Feb. 6 (or the following Monday if it falls on a weekend), Clay Polamalu Day on campus, in honor of the day that two of USC’s finest heads of hair clashed in the Super Bowl.
Every student would have to wear wigs of either puffy, curly black hair or long, flowing golden locks and everyone would get to class 15 minutes early, hoping to grab a front row seat.
I would install water fountains all over campus in the shape of Randy Johnson’s left arm, and every fifth day, the water would shoot 95 miles per hour out of his palm, and I wouldn’t tell anyone simply because it would be hilarious to watch people cautiously approach the fountain wondering if today would be the day.
Birds will quickly learn it is not a bird bath.
I would rename McDonald’s Swim Stadium, Krayzelburg’s Complex, in honor of former Trojan and four-time Olympic gold medalist Lenny Krayzelburg, simply so we could have the Krayzelburg Krazies.
I would confile:///Network/Servers/nexus.usc.edu/Volumes/Nexus%20Bravo/Work%20Folders/ashleymw/Desktop/images-2.jpegvince city officials to knock down the University Village, move the Natural History Museum there and replace the museum with a giant field all in one night.
This not only gives USC more field space to get even better at sports (is that possible?), but also provides a prime area for people to tailgate whenever it’s 75 degrees and sunny, especially on the three days leading up to gameday.
The Coliseum needs to get its intimidation factor back (it worked for the Seahawks).
I guess the only problem with that is the rowdy fans might open the San Andres Fault, but it’s got to happen eventually, so let’s just get it over with.
I would send a cease and desist letter to Washington State for futility and replace them with UNLV starting this year.
I would be able to do this because I would send Will Ferrell to the offices of the other nine athletic directors in the Pac-10, including Washington State, and by the end of his presentation they will unanimously agree with me.
Just in case, I will also send Joe Francis.
And since the Pac-10 screwed USC out of the weekender by putting the Cal game on a Thursday, the game at UNLV would replace it, and USC would play an away game at UNLV every year.
Yes, you read that right — we’d have a weekender in Vegas every year.
I would put lights on McAlister Field, so we could have nighttime women’s soccer games, because don’t tell me that wouldn’t be awesome.
More than 8,000 people turned up for the night game against UCLA this year, and even though it wouldn’t be in the Coliseum, McAlister would be packed if just one-third of those people showed up.
Every five years, I would pay a star high school basketball player who is destined to only play one year in college before going pro to come to USC and then give the team self-inflicted sanctions of postseason bans the following two years.
After all, everybody knows that the most exciting season of USC basketball was when O.J. Mayo was around.
I would put fireworks in the scoreboard at Dedeaux Field, because as a Chicago native and White Sox fan, there’s nothing cooler than fireworks coming out of the scoreboard after a home run.
Finally, I would commission a bronze statue of legendary USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic to be put outside Krayzelburg Complex, and every so often it would randomly yell something very nice at passersby, but in a terrifyingly thick Eastern European accent.
That would be the end of my long day as Athletic Director. I’d then hand the reins back over to Pat Haden, but not before I take care of one last bit of business.
Attend the first Division-I USC men’s soccer game, under the lights, this century.

In what is a historically lopsided rivalry, it will take a few more generations of Trojan athletes to bridge the 37-85 all-time series deficit against the No. 4 UCLA men’s volleyball team.
Eager to continue that arduous ascent to .500 after having won its previous two games against the Bruins, the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (5-0, 5-0) will square off against UCLA (6-2, 1-1) tonight in a 7 p.m. match at the Pauley Pavilion.
Leadership · Despite struggles against UCLA in seasons prior, senior opposite Murphy Troy and USC look to achieve their best start since 1994. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
History is largely irrelevant to a USC team that has only ceded one set all season, as the Trojans are outperforming their opponents in nearly every statistical category imaginable.
In fact, the only category in which the Trojans have not been besting their foes this season is home attendance, as the Trojans have averaged a paltry 550 spectators per game at the Galen Center, albeit only through two games.
“I expect this to be the toughest test so far,” said coach Bill Ferguson. “They’re a big, physical team — just like we are — with a great middle blocking core. We expect it to be a crazy evening, as there’s so much history between these two programs.”
Come tonight, however, the Trojans will try to temper their excitement and not let the rivalry distract their focus from their own individual game plans. A recurring theme in all player interviews this season has been the Trojans’ dedication to fine-tuning their own skills and game plans,while not concerning themselves with other teams’ scouting reports.
“Like every game, it’s about the serve-and-pass battle,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “If we continue to do that, we’ll be fine. We want to jump on them early. Every game against the Bruins is important, but they’re also just another team in a long season.”
UCLA enters the game fresh off of an efficient three set-win against Pepperdine after having struggled against Long Beach State — a match they lost in five sets. Outside hitter Gonzalo Quiroga and quick hitter Weston Dunlap lead the attack with 75 and 74 kills, respectively.
Despite the early season success and the accolades the Trojans have received, ranging from their continuous No. 1 ranking to senior opposite Murphy Troy’s National Player of the Week award, perhaps the greatest reason for optimism moving forward is that this team feels it has yet to hit its stride.
“One of our strengths has been our steadiness, especially with our play in the middle,” Ferguson said. “In most cases, we’ve been able to run our offense the way we want. We weren’t satisfied with our passing last night or in some of our other games. We can be so much better.”

It wasn’t quite a duel in the desert, but when all was said and done in Tempe, Ariz., USC had clawed its way to a hard-fought, 63-61 victory over Arizona State on Thursday night.
In a game that was for all intents and purposes a measuring stick for USC (12-9, 4-4), the team found a way to win despite a sluggish start and a potential game-winning three-point opportunity by Arizona State senior guard Ty Abbott as time expired.
Big Lift · Looking to rebound from a poor showing against California a week ago, junior forward Nikola Vucevic led all scorers Thursday with a game-high 26 points. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Behind six early turnovers, the Trojans quickly found themselves down 19-8 before showing signs of life in the Valley of the Sun.
“[USC coach Kevin O’Neill] told us that even though we committed some early turnovers at the offensive end, it starts at the defensive end,” said junior forward Nikola Vucevic.
Paced by seven quick points off the bench from senior guard Donte Smith, USC managed to whittle away at the Sun Devils’ lead, and found itself down by only two after 20 minutes of play, 31-29.
In the second half, USC relied on its offensive bread and butter, the post presence of Vucevic. The junior forward put together his own eight-point run to keep the visiting Trojans within striking distance at 43-39.
Down the stretch, freshman guard Maurice Jones looked to put the game firmly in the hands of the Trojans, logging seven of his 14 total points during a pivotal 11-2 scoring run.
Although the Trojans looked to be in control with just less than seven minutes remaining, their first road win in more than a month would not come without a late-game scare.
Senior forward Rihards Kuksiks found a hot hand from three-point range, as he hit three baskets from behind the arc to cut USC’s lead to 57-56 with 3:06 left in the game.
While a three-point shot by ASU’s sophomore guard Trent Lockett once again cut the deficit to one at 62-61, the Sun Devils (9-11, 1-7) could not find a way to secure their first home win in conference play as their final chance from the right corner fell off the back rim as time expired.
For the Trojans, the win marked their first away from the Galen Center on the 2010-2011 season, and even more noteworthy, their first facing a zone defense.
“Even with the zone, in order to win on the road we have to play better at the defensive end,” Vucevic said. “Tonight that’s what we did even though Rihards [Kusiks] had a lot of points. And really that was the difference.”
Offensively, the team was largely led by Vucevic’s 26 points and Smith’s contribution off the bench with 11 points and four assists.
“I was much more aggressive in this game than I was in the game against California,” Vucevic said. “And tonight as a team I think we just showed we weren’t afraid to come back.”
USC continues its three-game road trip on Saturday afternoon at the McKale Center in Tucson, Ariz., against host Arizona Wildcats.

USC sophomore wide receiver Brice Butler will transfer, according to a story published on ESPNLosAngeles.com Wednesday night.
“I’m leaving because I want to play football in the NFL and a big key to that is playing in college,” Butler told ESPNLosAngeles’ Pedro Moura in a text message. “And I feel that after this season that would be a tough task staying here.”
Around 11 p.m. Wednesday, Butler announced his decision via Twitter saying, “Always will be a part of trojan nation! No regrets, I just gotta go play fball, which isn’t happening here… I love all y’all! Always will.”
Butler had not previously indicated he would transfer.
A native of Norcross, Ga., Butler had a promising freshman year in 2009, totaling 20 catches for 292 yards and two touchdowns. He played in all 12 games and started against Stanford, where he caught six passes for 96 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown grab. As a result, he was named to ESPN.com’s All Pac-10 freshman team.
Those numbers, however, failed to carry over to 2010, as he was lost among a new coaching staff. Despite playing in 12 of 13 games, he caught just nine passes for 112 yards and one touchdown, as he was behind the likes of fellow receivers Robert Woods, Ronald Johnson and Brandon Carswell.
Though Johnson was a senior, Butler would have faced stiff competition from redshirt freshman Kyle Prater, who was a highly rated recruit last year, as well as two incoming freshmen. George Farmer, who is ranked the No. 1 wide receiver and No. 3 prospect overall nationally by Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, and Victor Blackwell, who is ranked 18th nationally for wide receivers by Rivals, both have committed to USC.

Maybe it's time to re-energize the budget deficit and create jobs. | Creative Commons
As the United States finds itself mired in a lagging economy with a national unemployment rate stubbornly hovering above 9%, most pre-speech chatter figured President Obama would focus on job creation and economic recovery in his address.  The recent appointment of Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric CEO, as the head of Obama’s new jobs council, seemed to signal too that the President’s focus would almost certainly be on jobs.
So it came as quite a surprise when the President made his way to the podium in the Congressional Chamber and started speaking about clean energy.  He give top billing to clean energy and declared that research and development in the field is “our generation’s Sputnik moment” and a means to, among other things, create jobs. Millions of Americans from Wall Street to Main Street and cul-de-sacs in between are unemployed and the best idea the President has is to throw taxpayer money at a sector which can offer, at best, limited returns?
Sinking gobs of money into an industry that requires, by its nature, huge government subsidies and which already has numerous – and for that matter, better – substitutes is not a means of stimulating job creation in the near term.  Perhaps the United States will, in fact, become a global leader in clean energy someday in the future.  But, while achieving the 80% renewables mark set forth by Obama in his speech could be considered by some to be today’s Space Race, it will have zero immediate impact for the average unemployed American.
Rather, what the U.S. economy needs now is a re-energizing of its powerful consumer base.  Such a re-ignition of dynamic American consumerism will come from only one place – reducing the nation’s unemployment rate.  To reduce unemployment, employers need to begin hiring in significant numbers again, but they won’t hire workers unless they can do so profitably.  If Barack Obama is truly concerned about creating jobs for average Americans right now he will spearhead the effort to cut the US Corporate Tax rate.  Combined Federal and State Corporate Taxes exceed 50% for major firms; U.S. rates are exceeded only by Japan, a dubious distinction given Japan’s well-documented economic malaise.
If employers keep more of their own money they will be apt to spend more on both labor and capital.  New employees will then have money to spend on all sorts of discretionary purchases, thus increasing profits for those selling purchase items, enabling the cycle to perpetuate itself.  Multiplied out across the entire country, the resulting economic boost is gigantic.  Employers, employees, and local governments will all benefit from a Corporate Tax cut, and most importantly, new jobs will be created right now.
This, of course, is not to say that President Obama didn’t mention cutting the corporate tax at all – he did mention it.   But he mentioned it after spending more than half his speech on clean energy, education, high speed rail, and high speed internet, and immediately before discussing his openness to altering the healthcare act, which, judging from the past, won’t happen, a federal spending freeze, which, also judging from the past, won’t happen, and a lame joke about salmon regulation.  You know what that means.

For awhile, it had been thought that the Tennessee Titans’ front office would have a choice to make this offseason: retain their potential franchise quarterback or the longest-tenured coach in the NFL.
Both Vince Young and Jeff Fisher clashed many times during the 2010 season, as Fisher opted to start veteran Kerry Collins instead of Young. The situation appeared settled, however, when the Titans released their mercurial quarterback who, despite his hefty winning percentage as a starter, has yet to deliver on the potential he once demonstrated at the University of Texas.
Now, it appears that the organization will proceed without both, as Jeff Fisher, according to SI.com, has resigned as head coach of the Tennessee Titans.  Although he did not indicate his reasons, many believe that Fisher was disgruntled about losing two of his longtime defensive coaches this past offseason.
Fisher played football at USC from 1977-80 as a defensive back, and was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 7th round in the 1980 NFL draft. Former athletic director Mike Garrett was interested in hiring Jeff Fisher prior to hiring Pete Carroll in 2001. When Carroll left for the NFL last year, Fisher was once again a candidate of interest, but he declined to compete for the coaching vacancy. Current coach Lane Kiffin was hired instead.

My Chemical Romance is a band whose appearance has been critiqued almost as often as their music.
With each album comes a different aesthetic style, from black suits to marching band uniforms. The group’s latest release, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, features band members in outfits as colorful as the bold new album. 
The group’s theatrics and wardrobe changes make them an easy target for sneering critics, but behind all of the gloom and the glam are four passionate individuals who genuinely care about music, art and their fans.
Vocalist Gerard Way, bassist Mikey Way and guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero visited the GRAMMY Museum at L.A. Live for an intimate question-and-answer session Wednesday. MCR superfans began lining up outside of the museum the night before, some people traveling from as far as Argentina to attend the event.
Bob Santelli, executive director of the GRAMMY Museum led the interview, discussing the band’s beginnings, evolving sound and controversy.
The events of Sept. 11, 2001, profoundly influenced MCR and the formation of the band. The Way brothers were especially moved by the incident and were inspired to change the course of their lives.
“I was doing something really irrelevant at the time that I didn’t feel was important, and I remember thinking to myself that I can’t waste this,” Gerard Way said. “What I ended up processing in my head is that life isn’t a game. It isn’t something you waste.”
Two weeks later, the band had their first rehearsal with the Way brothers, Toro and then-drummer Matt Pelissier. At the time, Iero was the guitarist for punk band Pencey Prep and supported MCR from afar.
“I remember being a fly on the wall when they finished the first song they ever really recorded, and they were so excited about it,” Iero said. “They would play it over and over again and high five each other.”
In 2002, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love was released, and in the span of a decade, MCR went from playing five-song sets for a crowd of 200 to playing for sold-out arenas and going on world tours. The mainstream success of their second album, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, caused many from the underground community to cry “sellout,” but the band was not fazed by the insult.
“We all come from such different backgrounds musically. We played what was in us and that’s really how the sound was formed,” Toro said. “I think we have a unique sound and a unique take on music, and that take is anything goes.”
The band recently released SING, its second music video from Danger Days, a production keeping in tune with the adventurous concept album. Still, making the record was no easy process after taking four years off.
“There was such a creative burnout after The Black Parade that it was hard to figure out what was going to come next,” Gerard Way said. “What this record really represents to me is not separating music and art anymore, because there’s no reason to. If you’re going to be passionate about something, it should be everything that you do.”
The evening took an emotional turn during audience questions. A girl about 10 years old shared that she was a cancer survivor and asked the group what their inspiration was for the song Cancer. The band spoke about spending time with children from the Make-A-Wish Foundation and how they were humbled by their experiences.
“We got so much more out of it,” Iero said. “It was amazing to be in the presence of so much strength.”
The night ended on a high note when another audience member inquired how it felt for the guys when people came up to the band to say that MCR’s music has helped them.
“When some of you say that, I feel like you’re not giving yourself enough credit. We were there as a soundtrack and maybe we provided you with some comfort, but you are the ones who actually saved your own lives,” Iero said. “It chokes me up how universal music is and how much it can change people’s lives.”
I love mcr so much; I really hope gee dyes his hair back blonde ;D

The movie world lately has had reboots on the brain. Although it’s exciting to see a favorite superhero or story brought to life again, where is the limit? Browsing through the list of movies coming in 2011 and recent announcements for 2012, many of these films seem, well, familiar.
For some, Spider-Man reboot may not be the best thing yet. | Creative Commons
What’s on tap? There’s (500) Days of Summer director Marc Webb’s Spider-Man reboot, with Andrew Garfield taking over for Tobey Maguire as a teenage Peter Parker. Also in the loop is Zack “300” Snyder’s restart of the Superman franchise,just a few years after the successful Superman Returns.
Then there’s Rise of the Apes, both a prequel to and reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise  and a new Spy Kids movie, which boasts a whole new cast and apparently shot for an audience unfamiliar with the series.
Why are there so many continuity reboots in the works? Were the last films of the franchises not successful? Surprisingly, most of them were actually hits, which makes Hollywood’s restart obsession incredibly strange.
Some reboots have been extremely successful, such as Christopher Nolan’s reinvention of the Batman series. Not every modern take is an attempt to make things “grittier,” “more realistic,” or to pander to “modern audiences.”
At times it makes sense to relaunch a franchise. Sometimes long-running series just run out of steam. This often results in a decline of interest and soon enough, the continuity-heavy stories fade into obscurity.
A new version can allow audiences without any familiarity with the original storyline to rediscover stories and characters. This worked for franchises like Batman and even James Bond.
The rising popularity of reboots in Hollywood is more disturbing than the concept of constantly recreating classics, however. Having run many franchises down with endless sequels, it seems that the studios are continually crafting new arrangements of the same idea, and only a few years after a similar movie premiered.
The answer to why the rate of reboots has gone up so much in the last decade seems to be a response to today’s information overload.
Modern movie audiences are bombarded with constant waves of entertainment options, with multiple streams and ever-changing content. There are more television channels than ever, each producing its own shows. The Internet offers endless articles, archived videos and original material.
At the same time, these info streams are reaching new audiences. Formerly niche, cultural movements are expanding into demographics that might not previously have known them.
Music genres are reaching across regions and traditional cliques. Characters and concepts like superheroes, coming of age stories and sports stars are now crossing over in popularity and awareness and are no longer subset interests.
Ask anyone who Iron Man is — chances are they will answer correctly.
With that level of information overload, it is harder than ever for people to stay focused on one thing for long. In the cinema realm, viewers are experiencing a form of ADD with what they watch.
Why follow one story for many years over multiple installments, when a new version can come out every 10, or even five years?
Hollywood is fighting to keep people in movie theaters and keep viewers’ attention focused on cinema and not any other entertainment stream, and it’s employing whatever tricks it can.
Such tactics might involve adding gimmicks like 3-D or dusting off popular characters and bringing them into a contemporary setting, no matter how recently they might have last appeared.
But how soon until this trend goes from acceptable to offensive? Will reboots still be tolerable when the studios decide that audiences need a darker and edgier adaptation of The Godfather, starring a young teen heartthrob as Michael Corleone?
Or perhaps audiences need to see Harry Potter, but this time it should be closer to the books. Or instead of Harry, Ron and Hermione being best friends, let’s change up the dynamic of things and make them rivals. And Voldemort won’t be a wizard supremacist, but a Machiavellian businessman from Gringotts. After all, corporate greed resonates much more with today’s audiences.
Continuity reboots aren’t inherently bad, and some have been for the better, but why do audiences need to see the same story over and over again, especially if it has been successfully told in the past?
Hollywood must stop trying to regurgitate a familiar yarn and consider investing in a new one. If Nolan’s Inception is any testament, people still respond to originality, both with their minds and their wallets.
Nicholas Slayton is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. His column, “Age of the Geek,” runs Fridays. 
“The answer to why the rate of reboots has gone up so much in the last decade seems to be a response to today’s information overload.”
Nicholas, I do not believe you got this one correct.  The audience is not to blame for Hollywood’s lack of creativity.  It all boils down to dollars and cents.  If Hollywood invests $30+ million on a film, they better get that much and then some in return.  They look at what sold well in the past and regurgitate a new form hoping it will do well at the box office again and again and again. Example: Plan on a 3D re-release of Titanic in 2012 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the sinking.  It’s no wonder the audience is hungry for new, creative forms of entertainment outside a movie theatre.

The Housemaid, a Korean drama-thriller and a remake of Kim Ki-young’s 1960’s film of the same name, is a rather heavy-handed critique of South Korea’s rich that, unsurprisingly, doesn’t live up to the original. The film, written and directed by the occasionally controversial Im Sang-soo, was recently screened in USC’s Ray Stark Family Theatre and will officially open today at CGV Cinemas in Koreatown.
Getting goosebumps · The Housemaid tries to create suspense, but at times the effects and characters comes across as too cheesy. The film employs classic suspense techniques that are ultimately ineffective. - Photo courtesy of IFC films 
The film centers around impoverished dishwasher Eun-yi (Jeon Do-youn). She is offered the opportunity of a lifetime by seasoned housekeeper Byung-sik (Yun Yeo-jong) and begins work  as a housemaid for the obscenely rich Goh family. The Goh family’s upper-class hobbies include swilling expensive French wine and listening to bombastic classical music, while looking as bored as humanly possible. The family consists of Hoon (Lee Jung-jae), his very pregnant wife Haera (Seo Woo) and their young, emotionally distant daughter Nami (Ahn Seo-hyun).
It doesn’t take Hoon long to make a late night visit to Eun-yi’s bed, and the housemaid soon finds herself pregnant. Of course, this triggers the wrath of Haera and her mother Mi-hee (Park Ji-young), who will stop at nothing until the baby is killed, driving Eun-yi to vengeful insanity.
Although the actors are believable (aside from Ahn Seo-hyun, who speaks as though she’s reading her lines from a card) the script does not take advantage of the characters’ distinct personalities and makes their relationships unconvincing. Eun-yi is childlike and naïve, but when Hoon begins to sexually harass her, she jumps headfirst into the affair with an adult eagerness that contradicts her nature.
Mi-hee is similarly perplexing. Icy, jaded, conniving, selfish and malicious, she is barely more than a standard villain. Watching her is particularly frustrating because it’s clear how much could have been done with her character if the story had allowed her to grow realistically.
Haera and Byung-sik are well-rounded, individual characters and manage to keep the story from falling apart. Both are incredibly sympathetic, despite their flaws.
Haera, portrayed excellently by Seo Woo, is ambiguously villainous but completely understandable. The film is also strengthened by Byung-sik, who commands the audience’s attention. She is stoic, conflicted and duplicitous in her intentions, but also provides most of the comedic moments in the film.
In addition to a few well-played characters, the film also manages to create a dramatic atmosphere and setting. The mansion interiors are luxurious and sterile, reflecting the glaciated family and the unsympathetic environment that Eun-yi has stepped into.
Sang Soo also plays with angles and juxtaposition of lighting. Though both come off as hammy when a character’s face is half-illuminated and half-dark, the lighting enhances the film as a markedly visual experience.
Unfortunately, that film includes many sex scenes between Eun-yi and Hoon that might make uncomfortable viewers wonder if Sang Soo originally intended The Housemaid as a skin flick. The scenes are graphic, gratuitous and full of vulgar dialogue so embarrassing that they render themselves pathetically corny.
In addition, the extreme music and up-close facial shots make what little tension there is feel fabricated. The entire film resembles a schmaltzy soap opera as opposed to the thriller it was clearly intended to be.
The Housemaid is an odd movie to pin down. Full of numerous distracting faults like insufficient character development and contrived dialogue, it banks on the anticipation of the audience, but never pays off.  Truly scary, satisfying scenes are missing.
Indeed, this unfulfilled potential is frustrating, even if there’s enough spark to keep the film mildly interesting. The Housemaid should have been great, but is instead a messy, mediocre film that desperately needs to be cleaned up.

Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Biutiful, which was nominated for multiple Oscars, is a complex film that delves into the multi-faceted life of Uxbal (Javier Bardem), a mysterious man struggling to find a balance between his demanding work in the impoverished Barcelona underworld while tending to his familial needs and searching for salvation.
Family man · The film zeroes in on the character’s family life and his struggles with his bipolar, alcoholic wife and his uncanny ability to read the minds of dead people. - Photo courtesy of Roadside Attractions  
When the audience first meets him, Uxbal is in the midst of raising two children alongside his dysfunctional, alcoholic, bipolar wife (Maricel Ålvarez) who struggles with the pressures of motherhood and her desire to extend her youth further than adulthood allows. Uxbal splits his time between aiding African street vendors and finding locations to sell their illegal merchandise, overseeing a sweatshop of Chinese refugees, supporting his struggling family and living with a serious and painful illness.
On top of his responsibilities, Uxbal also has the ability to read the minds of the deceased, which he uses to grant families closure in grieving for their lost ones. To say that Uxbal is attempting to balance the lives of five different men is an understatement. But, to argue that he is doing so in a stoic and unsympathetic manner, which he seemingly tries to exude to the world around him, is untrue.
The film does not begin with any contextual explanation. Instead, the audience is thrown into the middle of Uxbal’s life.  Slowly, as the film continues, the pieces come together. This affords the audience a deeper understanding of both Bardem’s character and what his life entails.
Uxbal’s natural ambiguity and complex struggles renders the film unpredictable and grants the audience the ability to let its imagination and curiosity run rampant.
Full of sadness, sickness, darkness and death, Biutiful is not an easy film to watch. Uxbal’s illness, diagnosed in the middle of the film, serves as motivation for him to accept the world around him instead of constantly trying to impose a strict and magisterial hand upon his children and the people in his life. It is not until the middle of the film that we see Uxbal genuinely smile, alongside his family.
Iñárritu creates a film that unfolds with patience and realism. There is no narration, no obvious plot action, but a creative angle used to tell the story of an alienated man who wants to help the world around him but is unsure of how to do so. The director generously uses wide-angle shots, which contributes to the creativity of the cinematography, distorting conventional perspectives of the film’s various landscapes. The many close-ups of Bardem’s face make his pain, confusion and loyalty disconcertingly visceral to those watching.
Bardem embraces his role wholeheartedly, making us feel his dejection throughout the film’s significant length. The cold strength of his eyes makes it difficult to remind ourselves that this isn’t Bardem’s actual life. Bardem perfectly exudes the emotional intensity that Uxbal’s role demands.
Anyone with an interest in character complexity will find Uxbal a worthwhile soul to explore. Despite meaning well, the contradictions of his life and the discomfort he feels in revealing his humanism to the outer world creates a barrier between his logical side and his emotional counterpart.
Biutiful forces its audience to wonder whether or not the pure intentions of a man outweigh what most would interpret as harsh behavior. Although Uxbal offers food and shelter for Chinese refugees, their living conditions and quality of life are dismal. He hands out money and protects others, but remains a stern, unbreakable and ultimately vulnerable man.
Regardless of whether we can ever empathize with Uxbal or find our own meaning within his story, most will likely agree that Bardem’s performance is undeniably award-worthy.
The film is fascinating, and trying to label it a “good” or “bad” picture is a difficult task. For some, the intense subject matter and the complexity of Biutiful might be deterrents. If you have two and a half hours to spend watching the film, and an hour to spend thinking about it, watch it. If you are unable or unwilling to devote such time, don’t bother.
Great review — well written.
However, I must take issue with one thing. You mention that Uxbal “has the ability to read the minds of the deceased which he uses to grant families closure in grieving”.
I didn’t see it that way. He didn’t have any such ability. He was a conman with this. (Remember the scene at the funeral of the little boy and the watch?). He was doing it for money.

Since the tragic shooting in Tucson, political commentators have made a habit of noting how “divisive” the country’s politics are, promising to rein in their rhetoric.  President Obama has asked for more polite discourse, and politicians have responded with the predictable gestures
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Speaker John Boehner has replaced “job killing” in his lexicon with “job destroying,” and Republicans and Democrats agreed to sit next to each other during the State of the Union address leading to numerous bad jokes about the high school prom.
Lost in what has seemed like a national celebration of harmony during the last few weeks  is that there still is a difference between actual cooperation and friendly rhetoric.
As long as both parties remain unwilling to compromise on or even begin to address the chief threats to American prosperity, Obama and Boehner can hold hands and sing “Kumbaya” as much as they want without using their positions to actually help anybody.
From the perspective of a USC student, there are two major problems that, if not resolved, will significantly diminish our opportunities in the future: unemployment and the deficit.
Students should be aware not only of the magnitude of these threats, but also that the “new spirit of cooperation” in Washington seems to only conceal political cowardice and inaction on both fronts.
Unemployment has been hovering just under 10 percent and falling slowly, but the progress is deceptive. Currently, the economy is not creating enough jobs to keep pace with new entrants into the workforce (read: today’s college graduates).
If, however, a USC graduate is able to find a steady job and embark on a promising career, down the line he might find that today’s politicians are making it rain on his parade.
The national debt is on its way past $14 trillion, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this year’s deficit alone will approach $1.5 trillion, with $400 billion of that coming from December’s tax cut/unemployment insurance combo deal that was hailed as an archetype of bipartisan cooperation.
The bill for all this will come one day when our credit runs out, but today’s politicians seem inclined to leave that for the next generation (read: today’s college graduates).
Even though solutions to the unemployment problem seem to exacerbate the deficit problem, and vice versa, there is a way to address both. It will require reallocating the budget, reforming regulations and balancing the government’s books.
All three of these steps, however, require a combination of intelligence and cajones that are noticeably absent in Washington, as highlighted by Obama’s underwhelming State of the Union address.
There are a number of important regulatory reforms that ought to be undertaken, from finance to education. Yet it seems again that in the name of “cooperation” tough choices are being avoided.
For example, Obama has stopped calling out businesses for offshoring jobs and instead has named General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt as a main economic advisor, even though GE’s deal with China, announced last week, was arguably a symbol of everything that is wrong with our economic strategy.
Finally, there is the issue of balancing the books. Republicans want to cut 20 percent of discretionary spending, or 3.4 percent of the overall budget.
Given that our deficit is at 10 percent of GDP this year, the fact that this can pass for a reasonable suggestion is ludicrous (but for Democrats to call the Republicans out on it would be “uncivil”).
Democrats, on the other hand, have basically no plan to fix the deficit, because they lack the political courage to tell Americans what they do not want to hear: There is no way to fix the deficit without raising taxes.
Given these predicaments, the state of the union appears less than strong. But let’s not point that out — let’s be polite instead.
Surely we can find the appropriate balance of engaging in meaningful conversation without being too light — or too hard — on our political opponents.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Fridays. 
I’m really tired of reading TERRIBLE political analyses in the Daily Trojan. Really, out of thousands of undergraduate students, THIS amateurish try-to-sound-authoritative misery is the best we could come up with???
Sincerely,
Concerned student
And for heaven’s sake, when you REIN something in you use REINS, not reigns, which Obama is currently enjoying. Aren’t there any copyeditors at the DT?
Paul Ryan has been proposing (and quite civilly I might add) some tough and commonsense proposals to solve the problems you address. I suggest you read them. Not everyone “on both sides of the aisle” is unwilling to find solutions.

If America is a melting pot of different cultures and ideas, then our national political debate could be described as a food fight.
As ugly as the American pastime of partisanship might be, it is a tradition that has evolved for a reason, and is not the sole cause of our problems.
In the weeks following the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, many public figures have called for a new era of political civility, but the movement to end vitriol in politics seems to have evolved into a dangerous call for silence on political issues.
It’s not a defined movement, but rather a scattered symptom of the shock that we all felt following Jared Lee Loughner’s brutal shooting rampage Jan. 8. I myself was quick to judge Loughner’s motivation, wondering if he was a representative of a new, more violent Tea Party movement.
I joined in the finger-pointing before I realized that such blame would never undo the horrific act that occurred in front of the Tucson supermarket. Politicizing the reaction to the shooting would only dishonor the memory of those who died that day.
In the weeks since then, the press  spoke of renewed civility in Washington. Instead of talking about compromises on healthcare, the environment and immigration reform, we focused on where Congressmen would sit during Obama’s State of the Union Address.
When I think of civility, I don’t visualize political enemies awkwardly sitting next to each other, attempting to avoid eye contact.
I think of compromise and shared sacrifice. We don’t have to like each other, but we have to talk to each other.
Yet many are now confusing debate with discussion to the point of absurdity. In an Op-Ed piece appearing in the Los Angeles Times, Stephen Randall, distinguished deputy editor of Playboy, worried about the proliferation of opinions in America.
“The Internet is a Petri dish of opinion inflation, breeding commentary like bacteria,” he said.
Even comedians aren’t safe from the civility police.
In a letter to the Times, one reader said that Gervais’ timing was tactless, as the Globes took place only days “after our President asked Americans to be nice to one another.”
I guess Obama’s historic speech following Gifford’s shooting was less about political understanding and more about respecting Robert Downey Jr.
Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik called for Americans to tone down their partisan rhetoric.
His call elicited a mixed response, with some praising his frankness and others condemning him for using a tragedy to criticize right-wing radio hosts.
But his remarks hold an element of truth. Our national political discourse has been hijacked by attention-seekers.
There’s little money in encouraging intelligent discussion of the issues; it’s very profitable to be controversial.
People can only educate themselves if they share ideas, so limiting debate simply makes the offensive people stand out more.
We can be gracious without being silent. Respect requires understanding, so instead of trying to make each other shut up, we should allow people to speak their minds.
The conversation will move past the same few boring wedge issues if we take the time to understand why we disagree, rather than focusing on what we disagree about.
Our history is filled with debates between great minds, from Jefferson vs. Adams to Lincoln vs. Douglas.
We should cherish our opinions, but also value our opponents as citizens who have an equal stake in the future of our democracy.
Dan Killam is a junior majoring in environmental studies.
Great article.  Why the silence by the Daily Trojan regarding the pillaging of KUSF by USC?
Great article!  Finally, a little intelligence and humor goes a long way.
The bottom line is the government and the media don’t want a society with people who are encouraged to stop and think about  the issues and what really goes on behind the scenes. That’s where entertainment steps in.
I do not believe the Tea Party is a violent movement.  In fact I know of no violence actually associated with that movement.  It  seems they simply want a return to Constitutional government and that sounds pretty good to me.

USC’s No. 1 singles player, junior Steve Johnson made his return to the courts after suffering an arm injury and battling the flu.
He did not particpate in the singles matches, but instead played alongside freshman Ray Sarmiento as the No. 1 seeded doubles pair.
His return didn’t go as planned as the pair ultimately fell to the Seminoles’ Vahid Mirzadeh and Clint Bowles, 8-6.
“We played a lot of balls today. It was a tough day for us, but we’ll bounce back [this weekend],” Johnson said. “I pretty much knew I was only playing doubles, so I wanted to give it my all. I didn’t serve very well and couldn’t keep it going.”
Despite the loss, the rest of the team picked up the slack, as the Trojans defeated the Seminoles, 6-1.
Doubles came down to the play of senior Jaak Poldma and sophomore JT Sundling and they didn’t disappoint, clinching a victory with an 8-4 win over Anderson Reed and Andres Bucaro.
Junior Daniel Nguyen and freshman Emilio Gomez defeated Clint Bowles and Blake Davis, 8-4, as well.
Singles play went more smoothly as Florida State made it clear that they were indeed a team to be taken seriously.
Though with Johnson out of the singles lineup, Nguyen took the No. 1 singles spot as Poldma and Sarmiento followed at No. 2 and No. 3. Gomez played at No. 4 followed by freshman Michael Grant and sophomore J.T. Sundling at No. 5 and No. 6.
Sarmiento rebounded from his doubles loss with Johnson to take his singles match against Florida State’s Connor Smith 6-1, 6-2.
“I like how I returned and I attacked him early on,” Sarmiento said. “I saw my opportunity and took it.”
Meanwhile, the Trojans continued their success in singles play with Poldma, Gomez, Grant and Sundling all winning their singles matches as well.
And as the season continues, the younger players will be crucial to the success of the team.
With that in mind, Sarmiento is willing to go the extra mile to play a vital role in the team’s success.
“USC is a great program,” Sarmiento said. “I’m honored to be on the team and will do whatever it takes to win.”

Tim Floyd trying to talk to OJ Mayo when he played basketball for USC. 
Former USC guard O.J. Mayo has been suspended without pay for 10 games, after violating the NBA’s anti-drug policy.
Mayo, currently a member of the Memphis Grizzlies, tested positive for dehydroepiandrosterone – a steroid precursor commonly known as DHEA.
“I’m extremely disappointed that I’m going to miss the next 10 games, particularly as our club is making a push for the playoffs,” Mayo said in a statement released on the team website. “I had no idea that the over-the-counter supplement that I took was a substance banned by the NBA.
“It was an honest mistake, but I take full responsibility for my actions.”
The suspension begins with Friday night’s game against the Philadelphia 76ers.
Mayo remains infamous in USC circles, for his involvement in an NCAA report released in June 2010 citing the university for a “lack of institutional control,” stemming from Mayo’s association with a runner, Rodney Guillory, for a sports agency. Previously, USC had self-imposed sanctions in January in preparation for the report’s release, preventing the team from participating in the postseason in 2010.
In the aftermath, the NCAA ordered that the university disassociate  itself from Mayo, who declared for the NBA Draft following the 2007-2008 season.
He is averaging 12.2 points and 2.6 rebounds this season with the Grizzlies.

11 Southern California college baseball coaches gathered at ESPNZone in Anaheim Wednesday to address the assembled media for the third straight year. Replacing new USC interim coach Frank Cruz, assistant coach Doyle Wilson was in attendance, where he discussed the Trojans’ upcoming 2011 season, which officially. begins Feb. 18 against Missouri at Dedeaux Field.
On the addition of Morgan Ensberg, a former infielder at USC and in the major leagues, as a graduate assistant
“Morgan’s done a great job. He comes down from San Diego. He’s not there all the time. Taking a few classes at ‘SC, so he comes out about maybe two days a week. He’s been a great presence for us. He’s a got a great attitude. Just brings a fun atmosphere, so he’s doing a good job.”
On signing three top 100 players in the offseason
“We feel real fortunate we got a kid Austin Wood in from Florida, [junior college] pitcher, big arm, had a real good summer in the Cape [Cod]. Ended up going in the fourth round and we didn’t think we were gonna get him, but he ended up showing up on campus. He’s a great kid and were really excited to have him.
On the team’s leaders
Ricky Oropesa has obviously done a great job for us the last two years knocking in runs and stuff, so he’s going to have a great year. And Andrew Triggs — bright, young kid, who was our Friday night guy last year
On handling transition from last season (note: coach Chad Kreuter was relieved of duties in August)
“That’s a good question. I think they’ve done a great job. I think coach Cruz brings an energy and discipline to the club. The kids are working harder than I’ve ever seen.”

Sarah Shourd, an American who was imprisoned in Iran for 410 days, will speak about her experiences on campus tonight.
Shourd will speak at “Imprisoned in Iran: American Hikers’ Search for Freedom” which will include a screening of Jeff Kaufman’s Free Shane and Josh: An Urgent Plea for Compassion, and a panel discussion to illustrate the toll the tragedy has taken on the families of the hikers.

The event, which is sponsored by The Gould School of Law, the School of Cinematic Arts and the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, will be tonight at 7 p.m. at the School of Cinematic Arts Complex.
Iranian officials arrested Shourd, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal in July 2009 after they accidentally crossed the border into Iran, accusing them of espionage. The Iranian government freed Shourd on Sept. 14, 2010 after 410 days of imprisonment.
Shourd’s fiancé, Bauer, and Fattal, however, are still imprisoned.
The film was made to provide more information about the imprisonment as well as to help others understand the situation of the hikers.
When the film was completed, Kaufman contacted Hannah Garry, the director of USC’s Law International Human Rights Clinic. He proposed that the clinic, which is dedicated to the global human rights movement, help to publicize the film. Garry took the project a step further by contacting the USC School of Cinematic Arts.
“[The USC School of Cinematic Arts] feels that sponsoring these kinds of documentaries that raise these types of issues is part of their mission,” Garry said.
The film aims to paint a clear picture of what happened to Shourd, Bauer and Fattal by providing personal stories of their detention in Iran.
“People don’t always get the right information or the full picture. It’s clear and comprehensive and it really helps people understand what happened to us,” Shourd said. “They can see where we were when we were arrested. They can hear it through my words and his documentary crew does a really good job of showing the toll this tragedy has taken on our families and us.”
Production of the film was put on hold when it appeared Shourd would be released. After her release, Shourd began to help with the documentary within a month.
Andrew Johnson, a freshman majoring in theatre, said he is eager to heard Shourd’s personal insight about the situation in Iran.
“It’s an exciting opportunity to bring this conflict to USC,” Johnson said. “And I think that being able to speak with someone who has lived through the episode in question offers a much more substantial learning experience for students.”
Shourd along with her mother Nora, Fattal’s brother Alex, Kaufman, Garry and Philip Seib, the director of the Center of Public Diplomacy at Annenberg, will be part of the panel, which will look at the current situation facing Bauer and Fattal, the toll this experience has taken on the hikers and their families and the injustice surrounding their detention.
“It will help to explain more of their personal stories and help us understand what happened,” Garry said.
Kaufman began production last summer and wanted to give his audiences a bigger picture of Iran to understand the situations the hikers faced.
“We were also able to connect to wonderful people around the world with phenomenal photographs that brought us really close to the landscape where they were imprisoned,” Kaufman said. “It was a fascinating and often touching international connection.”
“The most important message is that our arrest has been a misunderstanding and that we don’t feel any anger to Iranian leaders and their people,” Shourd said. “We hope they find it in their hearts to show the same compassion for Shane and Josh as they did for me.”
Maybe she can tell us what chadors and burkas are in style this year. Must have been tough for a bra burner from Berkeley to have to submit to the man for a while. I wonder if she values her freedoms a bit more now.
Will someone ask them why they chose to hike in one of the most dangerous places in the world?
I wonder if these three Berkeley lefties still think Islam is a “religion of peace” and Iran is a partner in tolerance and human rights, or whatever it is they thought.  It’s like the old saying, a conservative is just a liberal who’s been mugged — or in this case, a liberal who’s been raped in an Islamic dungeon for a few years…
A brilliant article; I commend the author on her eye-opening piece.
Make sure to turn in that CIA badge before arriving ahahah

The White House Office of Public Engagement hosted the 2011 White House Youth Kick-off Call on Wednesday night to discuss President Obama’s State of the Union address and the future of education for students.
David Plouffe, assistant to the President and senior adviser and Stephanie Cutter, assistant to the President for Special Projects, moderated the call and answered questions from young Americans.
“Like the president said last night, we need to really win the future and focus on innovation,” Plouffe said.
To achieve these goals, fundamental reform in education is needed to create higher student achievement, Plouffe said.
“We keep falling behind other countries in terms of math and science, so the president is going to put more effort into recruiting more teachers to teach in these subjects,” Plouffe said. “If you want to serve your country, save your community, become a teacher.”
Plouffe said one of Obama’s important goals is to make sure America is once again a country of college graduates.
“Before you know it, many of you are going to lead the country and we owe it to you to keep it in the best shape that you can,” Plouffe said.
During the conference call, a number of students voiced concerns about the state of health care in the United States.
Forty-six million graduates were uninsured for two years after graduating from college, according to Cutter. Additionally, one-third of these people have to delay education and career plans because of these bills.
