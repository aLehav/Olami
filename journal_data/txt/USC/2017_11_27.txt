In 2012, 270,000 women died from cervical cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Photo courtesy of USC News.
Intrauterine devices, also known as IUDs, have become an increasingly popular form of birth control for women, with a 99.9 percent effectiveness rate, according to Planned Parenthood. But according to a new study released by the Keck School of Medicine of USC, they can serve another purpose — offering protections against cervical cancer.
The study, a systematic review and meta-analysis, was published in Obstetrics and Gynecology on Nov. 7 and authored by various professionals, including Victoria K. Cortessis, an associate professor of clinical preventative medicine at Keck.
The 16 studies included in the meta-analysis observed over 12,000 women from around the world. The study concluded that women who use an IUD have their chances of developing cervical cancer lowered by a third.
“The possibility that a woman could experience some help with cancer control at the same time she is making contraception decisions could potentially be very, very impactful,” Cortessis told USC News. 
Data released by athenahealth, a healthcare record-providing company, revealed a 19 percent rise in IUD-related doctor’s office visits by women since 2016. Audrey Chu, a junior studying international relations and the global economy, had her first experience with an IUD when she was 21. 
“I was personally pretty good about taking the pill at the same time every day, but it was weird when I was taking antidepressants,” Chu told USC News. “I wanted a low-hormone or hormone-free option.”
According to the American Cancer Society, the rate of women contracting cervical cancer has already decreased by over 50 percent in the last 40 years, due to early detection using the Pap test. If detected in its early stages, cervical cancer can usually be cured, according to the National Cancer Institute.
Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomavirus, or HPV, but can be prevented with vaccines. 
The World Health Organization found that in 2012, of the approximately 270,000 women who died from cervical cancer, 85 percent were from developing countries. As of 2016, 65 countries had approved HPV vaccines, but preventative vaccinations and tests are still less accessible in African and Asian countries.
A contraceptive that also prevents cervical cancer may be useful in less developed countries, according to Cortessis. 
“A staggering number of women in the developing world are on the verge of entering the age range where the risk for cervical cancer is the highest — the 30s to the 60s,” Cortessis told USC News. “Even if the rate of cervical cancer remains steady, the actual number of women with cervical cancer is poised to explode.”
It remains unclear how exactly IUDs protect against cervical cancer. It is possible that the placement of an IUD may trigger a protective reaction in the cervix, which can fight off dormant HPV infections. HPV-infected cervical cells may also be scraped off during the removal of an IUD. 
Laila Muderspach, another author of the study and the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Keck, said that if scientists can demonstrate that the body mounts an immune response to having an IUD placed, for example, then they could investigate whether an IUD can clear an HPV infection in a clinical trial.
The Engemann Student Health Center provides several sexual and reproductive health services, including Pap smears and screenings for sexually transmitted infections.

With the Pac-12 Championship Game in Santa Clara, Calif., mere days away, USC head coach Clay Helton and Stanford’s David Shaw discussed a number of topics in a media teleconference call Monday morning. Here are the highlights.
On USC’s offensive playmakers
Shaw: We knew going into it that [redshirt sophomore quarterback] Sam Darnold is outstanding, [junior wide receiver] Deontay [Burnett] is an explosive receiver [and junior running back] Ronald Jones is an explosive runner … We missed a lot of tackles in that first USC game, and once again, it’s not just us missing them. Their guys were over there making you miss. Jones [II] runs through contact — he’s got that great ability to cut and get vertical and run through arm tackles. It’s going to be on us to know where our help is, set our feet, tackle with our chest, wrap up and play great, disciplined coverage.
Helton: The wideouts are really performing over the second half of the season: the development of a [redshirt freshman receiver] Tyler Vaughns, a [sophomore wideout] Michael Pittman on the outside, getting [redshirt sophomore tight end] Daniel Imatorbhebhe back to compliment [junior tight end] Tyler Petite, to get a [redshirt senior wide receiver] Steven Mitchell back healthy and really performing. The most growth we’ve had is in the offensive skill and receiver positions.
On USC’s bye week before the game
Shaw: If anybody in the country deserved it, it’s [the Trojans]. They went 12 straight weeks without a bye, playing nine conference games and Notre Dame. It’s brutal. So I know they’ve appreciated it and been able to recover a little bit.
Helton: I appreciate our team and our kids for really going through that challenge and coming out on the other end always looking at it as a positive — that if we got to the Pac-12 Championship game that would be our bye. Probably the biggest factor for us is we were a tired and beat up football team that needed a week to regroup and get healthy. After yesterday’s practice, that happened for us. We’re not all the way there yet, but we’re in a lot better position than we were a week ago.
On the game being so near to Stanford
Shaw: The fact that we don’t have to travel is huge because a short week and travel is very difficult. We’ve been looking at it … in our conference, and the percentages for winning a short week road game are miniscule.
Helton: I think our fans travel really well; they always have. I know we’ll have a bunch there. We’re just an hour’s plane ride [away]; they’re 17 miles [away]. I don’t think it’s a huge factor.
On Stanford quarterback K.J. Costello
Shaw: The bottom line for him is he’s got fire, he’s got passion, he’s got a strong arm [and] he’s an accurate passer. Once in a while, just like any other quarterback, he gets a little excited and maybe the footwork isn’t perfect, maybe the ball isn’t thrown right where it’s supposed to be — but there are times during a game where he will push up in the pocket and throw the ball as well as anybody.
Helton: K.J. has done a really nice job of stepping in, making the most of his opportunity and really protecting the football while hitting explosive plays downfield. We’ve watched K.J. grow up. He’s a Southern California kid — an extremely arm-talented kid that will pull the trigger, will anticipate and get rid of the ball. I think they’ve developed exactly what David wants to have: a fabulous run game with a quarterback that hits his shots down the field.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold eludes pressure during USC’s Week 2 matchup against Stanford. Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
On Monday, No. 11 USC began a short week of practice in anticipation of facing Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship, while offensive coordinator Tee Martin addressed his head coaching candidacy. This week’s conference championship game doubles as a rematch of the teams’ regular season contest and their 2015 Pac-12 Championship matchup. 
Rumors swirl 
When Tennessee fired head coach Butch Jones two weeks ago, USC offensive coordinator Tee Martin became a natural contender to fill the vacancy. He is a young coaching prospect with proven success since taking over play-calling duties in 2016 (the Trojans were second in the Pac-12 this year in total offense, with 488.6 yards per game). He also quarterbacked Tennessee to a national championship as Peyton Manning’s successor in 1998. 
With the Volunteers hiring and then un-hiring Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano amid student protests on Sunday, Martin’s name is once again coming up as a potential option. 
“I think he’d make a great head coach if he decides to go that route,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold said. “I think Tee is an awesome guy, so any time you get a great guy with that kind of offensive mindset, he’s going to make for a great head coach one day. We’ll see what happens.” 
On Monday, Martin stayed quiet about potentially filling his alma mater’s coaching vacancy. 
“I just don’t talk about other jobs during the season,” Martin said. “I’m going to focus on Stanford, and it’s something that will be talked about after the season.”
He added that he has not been interviewed by Tennessee.
Rumors also circulated regarding Darnold’s NFL future: The quarterback refuted rumors that he would return to school if the Cleveland Browns earned the No. 1 draft pick.
“I didn’t say anything about the Browns,” Darnold said. “I’ve never said anything bad about [an NFL] team. They know I would never say anything.”
Stanford’s improvements 
In Week 2 of the college football season, USC steamrolled Stanford for a 42-24 victory, while amassing over 600 yards of total offense. It still stands out as one of the Trojans’ most impressive performances of 2017. 
Since a challenging 1-2 start, Stanford has won eight of its last nine games, including victories over two top-10 teams. The Cardinal enter the Pac-12 Championship with loads of momentum after handling No. 8 Notre Dame this past weekend.
“I think right now, when you look at it, I think they’re stopping the run very well in the last seven games,” head coach Clay Helton said. “A little bit of it is schematically, they’ve made some schematic changes on their defense. But I think overall they’ve gotten better and that’s usually what [Stanford head coach] David [Shaw’s] team does as they go from game one to game 12.”
In their 38-20 victory over the Fighting Irish, the Cardinal stifled the dynamic duo of quarterback Brandon Wimbush and running back Josh Adams for 111 combined rushing yards. Notre Dame ran wild for 377 rushing yards against USC in its 49-14 win in October. 
“We beat Stanford by double digits, Notre Dame beat us by double digits, so when you look at that it’s pretty interesting,” Darnold said. “But we played Stanford early on in the season and Notre Dame was a while back too so I think it’s just two really good teams going at it on Friday.” 
Injury Notes
USC held both junior defensive lineman Rasheem Green and junior tight end Tyler Petite out of practice with shoulder injuries, with Helton citing both as day-to-day. He also announced that junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin was unlikely to play until a bowl game. Gustin has grappled with a broken toe for most of this season.

Senior guard Sadie Edwards was a key cog in USC’s run to the Rainbow Wahine Showdown title last weekend. Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
The women’s basketball team won the Rainbow Wahine Showdown on Sunday with a 71-60 victory over Hawaii, capping an undefeated Thanksgiving weekend in Honolulu.
The championship game began as a back-and-forth affair as the two sides exchanged leads seven times in the first half, but the Women of Troy pulled ahead late in the second quarter with a 14-2 run — spearheaded by 9 points in fewer than three minutes from junior guard Aliyah Mazyck. Senior forward Kristen Simon had poured in an impressive 15 points by halftime, while sophomore guard Minyon Moore was just behind her with 11.
But USC sputtered in the third quarter, shooting 17 percent from the floor and scoring just 9 points. The team’s 14-point halftime lead was quickly evaporating. As they did in the first half, however, the Trojans broke off a 10-1 run to re-extend their advantage and ice the game. USC’s seniors stepped up to lead the fourth-quarter rally: Guard Sadie Edwards led the way with 4 points while Simon chipped in 3 points — and Moore capped off the run with her first 3-pointer of the night.
Moore finished the game with 20 points, while Simon’s 25 led the way for the Trojans. Simon also grabbed a team-high eight rebounds against Hawaii, and her strong weekend earned her tournament MVP honors. Mazyck joined Simon on the All-Tournament Team.
After an unbeaten weekend, head coach Mark Trakh said he was happy with the team’s trip to Hawaii.
“I’m proud of the way the team played to win three games in three days,” Trakh said. “The seniors really stepped up, and Minyon was a real floor general.”
The Women of Troy also beat Purdue and Marist on back-to-back nights en route to the tournament championship. The team’s final victory over Hawaii clinched Trakh’s 400th career win.
“Winning 400 games really just means I’ve been coaching a long time, but all the credit goes to the kids I’ve coached,” Trakh said. “I’m really proud of the players I’ve worked with along the way, and I’m really proud of this USC team.”
Trakh has earned 97 wins as the Trojans’ head coach: He compiled a 90-64 record during his first stint at USC from 2005 to 2009, and he has led his squad to a 7-0 start this season in his first campaign since returning to USC last spring.
The Women of Troy return to California next for a matchup at Loyola Marymount on Friday.
Coach Trakh doing his job well. This is a five women team with absolutely no bench. Even Jordan Adams not the same
player she was before all those injuries. Surprised the coaches could not get a JC transfer to be a useful sub. Sorry to
say the two international players are useless except maybe for practices.

Junior forward Bennie Boatwright shoots in the Trojans’ season opener against Cal State Fullerton. Photo by Will Alpert | Daily Trojan
Two undefeated teams tipped off at the Galen Center on Sunday: the No. 16 Texas A&M Aggies (5-0) and the No. 10 Trojans (4-0).
The matchup was heralded as USC’s biggest non-conference test, a rematch against an Aggies team that returned all its starters from a year ago and added five more scholarship players. Last year, the Trojans won in College Station, Tex., 65-63 after some last-second heroics from then-freshman guard De’Anthony Melton. This year, the sophomore sat out due to eligibility questions (he has yet to play this season), and USC missed him sorely throughout in a 75-59 loss.
“It was a little different [without] De’Anthony,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He played great last year. We just didn’t play as well as they did.”
The game was supposed to be a barometer for the two teams, both national championship contenders, but USC, despite being the higher-ranked team, looked like David facing Goliath — if David forgot his slingshot.
“I thought our defense was good enough to win,” Enfield said. “Our offense was not.”
The Trojans trailed for most of the game, but they managed to square the score at 42 with 14:15 to play in the second half. Then, Texas A&M embarked on a 19-3 run over the next 7:41 that sucked the energy out of the Galen Center. With 8:34 remaining and the Trojans trailing by 16, Enfield called a full timeout.
The team initially responded well: Junior forward Bennie Boatwright, still scoreless, notched 5 points in under a minute. Then, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin pocketed a 3-pointer to cut the Aggies’ lead to 10. The score was 63-53 with seven minutes to play with plenty of time for a comeback.
But the Trojans could not shoot well enough to overcome another deficit. For the game, USC shot 20-of-71 (28.2 percent) and 7-of-27 (25.9 percent) from 3-point range. Enfield said it was the worst shooting performance a USC team has had in his five years with the program.
“It just deflates you,” Enfield said about missing so many shots. “We kept missing easy shots — shots the that we normally make.”
McLaughlin, the captain, kept urging his teammates to shoot, but nothing was falling.
“We know we have a lot of fight in us, [but] it kind of was a little deflating,” he said.
Texas A&M’s length interfered with the Trojans’ offense. The Aggies, anchored by reigning SEC Defensive Player of the Year center Robert Williams, blocked seven shots and disrupted several more plays at the rim. McLaughlin thought he missed a few floaters he otherwise would have made against a team with shorter players.
USC, which has three starters who average double-digit points, is supposed to be built to win these sorts of contests. When one player goes cold, another player is expected to heat up. Against a team with great post-defense, the Trojans are supposed to compensate with more 3-pointer makes.
Yet, on Sunday, every starter struggled and the offense was ice cold. Sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic did his best to spark the team off the bench. In 12 minutes in the first half, he had 11 points and six rebounds, but in the second half, he did not score.
“Everyone just needs to do their job,” McLaughlin said. “Tonight, Nick did his job.”
But, for USC, not enough players did.

Angel Viscarra | Daily Trojan
A consistent failure to win games, at any program, will inevitably put a coach on the hot seat. Just ask Jim Mora, who was recently fired as the UCLA football coach for not elevating the Bruins to elite status in his six seasons in Westwood.
While losing is the common denominator, different programs have a different tolerance levels and qualifications for being placed in the hot seat.
Take a stroll through USC Twitter during a Trojan football game, and you’d be convinced that head coach Clay Helton — a man who has his 10-2 team playing in the Pac-12 Championship on Friday — is one game away from getting the boot from Athletic Director Lynn Swann. 
Since the start of the 2016 season, Helton’s first year at the helm, USC is 20-5 overall. At the conclusion of his first full year as coach, Helton brought USC its first Rose Bowl trophy since 2009. Helton has never lost a game as head coach at the Coliseum (13-0 at home), and he will take his Trojans to Santa Clara this Friday to battle No. 14 Stanford for the Pac-12 Championship. USC has a chance to clinch its first conference crown since 2008.
Helton’s consistency for the Trojans has been undeniable. But it’s becoming clearer and clearer that those associated with the program are not so much pleased with consistency as they are with domination and playing for national championships. 
As USC’s grueling regular season went on, the Trojans slid out of College Football Playoff contention (they opened the season at No. 4 in the AP poll). But it must be noted that the Trojans were called to battle through an injury-plagued season that saw them play 12 consecutive games without a bye week — their first regular season without a bye week since 1995. To navigate through a gantlet of a regular season and escape with a 10-2 record and a Pac-12 South title is something to praise this team and coaching staff about. 
And so, it can be quite confusing at times to pinpoint what it is about Helton that makes him so disposable to fans and followers of the program. He has led USC to consecutive double-digit win seasons for the first time since 2007 and 2008 and has his team just one win away from a prominent New Year’s Six bowl. 
Those around the program often spout that Helton “just can’t win the big game.” This is strange, considering the fact that Helton’s first two seasons have seen him compile several impressive victories. 
Last season’s Rose Bowl berth wouldn’t have happened if Helton’s Trojans didn’t upset a tough No. 4 Washington team on the road. Many will claim heroics from then-redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold bailed Helton out, but something has to be said about battling back in the Rose Bowl to win a thriller against No. 5 Penn State.
And even this season, USC put together arguably the most complete performance of the Helton era in a 42-24 Week 2 victory over Stanford at home. 
Despite the 20-5 overall record, Rose Bowl victory, top recruiting class and now a berth in the Pac-12 Championship, many are still clouded when they begin to assess the Helton regime at USC.
But this Friday’s conference championship against the Cardinal may be Helton’s most crucial test yet. It certainly shouldn’t be a hot seat game, but it will be a barometer game for many USC fans — one where they will find out if Helton is the coach to bring the Trojans back among the undisputed elites of college football. 
Should Helton lead USC to victory and its first conference trophy since the Pete Carroll days, it’ll do a good deal of help in silencing the Helton haters. But if the Trojans come back to Los Angeles empty-handed, the “Fire Helton!”, “He’s not the right guy” and “Darnold saved Helton” rants will surely be cranked up a notch. 
Helton will not have history on his side come Friday night at Levi’s Stadium: No Pac-12 South champion has ever won the Pac-12 Championship Game (the game has been played six times). 
UCLA’s high-profile hiring of Chip Kelly this past week could also be added gasoline to the “fire Helton” bandwagon. When Helton was announced as USC’s full-time head coach in 2015, there were unpleasant rumblings as the land of Troy seemed to be hoping for a flashier candidate than Helton, who had been an assistant coach for the previous six seasons. If Helton doesn’t quite fit what USC fans want going forward, then all it takes is a look across town to Westwood to begin petitioning for the Trojans to make a flashy hire of their own. 
It’s easy to get lost in the hype and buildup of conference championship week. But now, more than ever, is an appropriate time for USC fans to take a breath and assess their condition holistically. 
Helton has been a benchmark of stability for USC so far in his tenure, both on and off the field. It’s ironic that the same fans who were clamoring for program stability when Lane Kiffin was fired on the tarmac and Steve Sarkisian was drunkenly ranting at Salute to Troy are the same fans calling for the head of an even-keel leader like Helton. 
The last USC coach to deliver back-to-back 10-win campaigns was Carroll, back in the 2007 and 2008 seasons. And while it is Trojan heresy to mention anyone in the same breath as Carroll, it must be noted that he went 17-8 over his first 25 contests as USC coach. Helton is 20-5 through his first 25. 
So what’s my message to the still-existent Helton doubters? Be patient.

Two-time Thornton graduate Duncan Thum earned a bachelor’s degree in humanities and a master’s degree in screen scoring. He is known for his compositions in film and television. Photo courtesy of Duncan Thum.
Duncan Thum, multi-instrumentalist and Emmy-nominated composer, started his musical journey under his father’s piano, listening to his father create music every day.
“I have very clear memories of experiencing music — the milieu of sound and emotion and color were an early spark for the imagination,” Thum said. “That planted a seed for what would be my whole adventure in studying music at USC and eventually becoming a composer.”
Thum initially attended the Thornton School of Music for his undergraduate education as a studio guitar major. After exploring myriad classes and activities, Thum eventually graduated in 2006 with a bachelor’s degree in humanities with an emphasis in music to fully devote himself to composing and other interests.
“Different styles of thinking and different ways of applying creative process really helped me as a musician,” Thum said. “I explored the whole plethora of arts, humanities and sciences available to us as USC students and that really broadened my horizon and fed back into this process of focusing on writing music.”
Less than two years out of USC with his master’s degree in screen scoring, Thum found himself on the Television Academy’s top-six list as a rookie Hollywood composer. For Thum, each composing process starts the same — with a crisis.
“The blank slate is always daunting,” Thum said. “Whatever successes you had with a past project are gone. You have to find that purpose again.”
Thum takes that blank slate and builds a world through music by working with the filmmakers and directors, examining the personalities of the characters and the theme to identify parts of the story that can only be conveyed through music.
Over the past few years, the USC alumnus has composed for a number of films including Dear Apple, Off the Rails and Dealt. He is best known for his work  on the Netflix documentary series Chef’s Table, which received Primetime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 2015 and 2016. Thum started working on the project shortly after receiving his master’s degree in screen scoring from Thornton. 
“You get to jump around to all these different countries and you have to find the collusion between these different worlds,” Thum said. “Your curiosity leads you through these different musical revelations.”
Thum has also composed for I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead, a documentary about electronic dance music  artist Steve Aoki, who went his own way instead of following in the footsteps of his father, the founder of Benihana.
“It was a fun story to tell through music,” Thum said. “You get into the psychological element of heartache, of finding your own identity and of working hard and trying to innovate.”
In addition to the next set of episodes for Chef’s Table, Thum is working on a feature film called The Iron Orchard, a story about a 1960s West Texan man who makes a fortune by striking oil. He is also in the beginning stages of collaboration with a pop musician and considering creating his own solo album. 
“Whenever we are involved with anything we are passionate about, it can be so easy to hamstring yourself and think that your project isn’t good enough,” Thum said, when asked what advice he would give his college self. “You’re creating this intense pressure to find an answer when really the answer is something that evolves slowly and you have to give it room to manifest itself.”

There is no artist quite like Björk, whose category-defying music can be classified as everything from art pop and electronica to alternative rock. The Icelandic songstress’ ability to push music into parts unknown is unparalleled, and her ability to constantly reinvent genres makes her artistry unmatched. In short, Björk is the music queen of the avant-garde, and on her ninth album, Utopia, she pushes her artistry even more as she invites her listeners to join her on a search for spiritual freedom. 
The album was produced by Björk and Venezuelan electronic music producer Arca. Their artistry harmoniously unites on the album. Arca brings beats with touches of both R&B and techno influences, while Björk brings classical elements. The result is an album that sounds like the soundtrack to a Jean-Antoine Watteau fête galante painting, or a short film set in the Icelandic wilderness. It’s a mixture of light and delicate qualities, with a sound like one would assume flowers in an enchanted forest would sing if they could. Utopia is an ode to nature. There are elements of the LP that are carefully put together, scattered all over the place, hard to understand and repetitive at times, but still very beautiful to encounter. It shows Björk’s earnest desire for finding the happiness and pure freedom in nature. 
Thematically, it speaks on personal detoxification and stands in stark contrast to her previous album, Vulnicura, which centered on her dark, bitter breakup with American artist Matthew Barney. The album begins where, lyrically, Björk is beginning to accept the notion of falling in love again. She has opened her heart again, as heard on “The Gate,” where she sings, “My healed chest wound / transformed into a gate / where I receive love from / where I give love from.” Through that gate, listeners are led into the title track, “Utopia,” where Björk admits to the toxicity of the pain that has been boiling inside of her, and her desperate need to escape from herself and purify and heal all that has been damaged. 
As the album continues, it becomes just as visual as it is sensory. With the song “Paradisia,” Björk instrumentally layers the flute, harp and baroque choral arrangements with opulence and frivolity to rival that of Rococo paintings. It also includes Icelandic and Venezuelan birdsongs throughout. Björk mixes her raw lyrics with the elegance of the composition behind it, bringing each track a unique sense of power.

“[We] wanted to make melodies that were like constellations in the clouds,” Björk said in an interview with FACT Magazine. “I think that fantasy and imagination are just as valid as reality. And I think that’s maybe what Utopia is also tapping into — how fantasies are just as vivid as reality.”
There are underlying feminist themes within this album. On “Tabula Rasa,” Björk sings, “It is time for us women to rise and not just take it lying down / It is time: the world is listening.” The song appears to be a letter to her daughter Isadora. Björk explains to Isadora the pain that Barney, Isadora’s father, has caused her with his extramarital affairs,  yet still urges her to stay strong and to rise up against those who try to tear her down. References to  Björk’s ex also appear on “Sue Me,” which speaks about the lawsuit Barney brought against her for not letting him spend enough time with their daughter. “I’ve ducked and dived / Like the mother in Solomon’s Tale / To spare our girl,” she sings, “Sue me, sue me, sue me, all you want / I won’t, I won’t denounce our origin.”
The only downfall of the album is in its length and redundance. The nearly seven-minute track “The Gate” could be cut down by a minute to save the listener from hearing Björk repeat the phrase, “care for you, care for you.” The production and composition of each track make it easy for the listener’s mind to wander; her lyrics are stunning, but sometimes unintelligible, and she often whispers against an overpowering beat, making it easy for the mind to zone out with the music rather than paying attention to what she has to say. 
Still, if Vulnicura was the storm of the breakup, then Utopia is the calm that follows. This album is not one to be absorbed in one sitting. It must be listened to repeatedly, and each song given individual attention. Then, after taking the journey over and over again, the listener can begin their own journey toward spiritual freedom, inspired by Björk.

Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
I had all the contents for my last column planned out. It was supposed to be a beautiful, deeply sentimental goodbye letter to both the Daily Trojan and USC. Even since the first week, I had already begun writing fragments that I could later place into the final draft. It made me misty-eyed just thinking about it. My final column would be the culmination of not only my time at USC, but also the end of a very special chapter of my life.
But then I got into USC for graduate school. And two days later, I enrolled in classes next  semester.
I’m coming back, y’all!
For those who haven’t been keeping up since the beginning of the semester, most of my column has been devoted to my adjustment returning to USC as an undergraduate student, after having taken some time off. I “graduated” in May 2016 — though I was shy two classes and didn’t actually get my degree. Instead of finishing right away, I worked as a freelance reporter for some time, only to have an inexplicable emptiness festering inside me. 
I couldn’t figure out why something felt off. In retrospect, all the signs as to why I felt so passive were there, such as powerful nostalgia for my college days and an intense yearning to return to those days. So, on a whim — much like Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed — I went back to school.
I remember my first day back so vividly. I walked among teenagers on the first day of fall semester, feeling both excited to have one last hurrah as a college student and ready to apply my learned life experiences in hopes of not repeating the same mistakes I did years before. I showed up to every class on time. I completed all assignments by the due date. I sat in the front and actively participated. I was determined to show these picayunes that Paris Gellar had arrived, and that she was ruthless when it came to getting the top grade. This would be my second chance to make things right.

I learned more about myself in this one semester than I have in the last seven years as an (on-and-off) undergraduate. Before returning to school, I assumed my discontentment was a direct result of my vacant diploma frame. I had initially returned to fill the void by recreating my early 20s, but I now understand these feelings were due to misdirected romanticization. Between “graduating” and eventually returning, my fantasies were plagued by real life. 
My original goal was to make it as a writer. Though I did achieve some success as a journalist, there was no way I could survive financially in a place like Los Angeles. I was urged by friends and family to move to New York City, but all the money I was making went toward living expenses. I could barely afford to go out in L.A. and when I did, I limited myself to a two-drink minimum. How could I possibly acquire the resources for a cross-country move without supplemental funding?
Slowly, my desire to be a writer was overshadowed by my need for basic life necessities. My priorities shifted — what could I do that is viable but wouldn’t compromise my happiness? So about two months ago, I decided to apply for the Management in Library and Information Science master’s program, with the hope of becoming a librarian. 
I didn’t want to apply for MFA programs or go to journalism school. If I were to frequent a graduate program, it would need to be — for lack of a better word — practical. But that isn’t at all to say I’m settling. I would love nothing more than to be a librarian (more specifically, a music librarian). I tried the whole being-a-writer-and-eating-beans-straight-from-the-can bit. It made me happy for a while. But I got it out of my system. I may romanticize creativity, but there is nothing sexier than a stable income.
If someone told me when I “graduated” that I’d eventually return, I’d probably scoff. I’d be even more tickled to know I’d even be going back for graduate school. But I’ve learned not to say goodbye too quickly, because if there’s one takeaway from these past 15 weeks, it’s to never say never. I’m not even saying goodbye to writing — I’ll still be freelancing here and there while also working on my own stuff. And I can still be a writer and do other things, can’t I? Who knows. Maybe my time as a librarian is just a pit stop. Or maybe I’ll live the rest of my life in the stacks. And I’m fine with that. The only way to find out is to experience it for myself.
But enough with the platitudes. And like I said, this isn’t goodbye. It’s only the beginning. I said it months ago, and I’ll say it again: I’m ready to go, from the top.
See you in January, fellow Trojans.

In November 2015, UCLA Undergraduate Students Association Council President Heather Rosen made a bet with USC Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath on the outcome of the annual UCLA vs. USC football game: The president of the losing campus had to write an op-ed in the winning campus’ school paper. 
Last week, I made that same bet with current USG President Austin Dunn. And unfortunately, the tradition of UCLA undergraduate student body presidents publishing in the Daily Trojan continues. 
In August 2017, the University of Southern California dedicated its newest sculpture of Hecuba, Queen of Troy. Hecuba is a homage to the women of the Trojan Family. She is celebrated for “preserv[ing] and protect[ing] her family and beloved city.” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said he wished for the sculpture to be a female mascot to stand alongside her male counterpart, Tommy Trojan. He believed she should embody the breadth of campus diversity — a feat that the Los Angeles Times claimed to be as impossible as Tommy Trojan flexing all his muscles at once.
Hecuba stands valiantly at 20 feet tall, on a platform featuring six women who are meant to represent her six daughters. Each woman was meant to depict a woman of Native American, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Caucasian, Asian or African descent. In addition to depicting the diversity of the University, the women are also meant to represent the diversity of USC’s academic disciplines, including social sciences, arts, science, humanities, medicine and technology. 
Hecuba stands on the shoulders of giants — literally and figuratively. 
It is not easy being a woman in leadership. Whether we are running to serve as president of the United States or president of our undergraduate students’ associations, women today face a slew of challenges and obstacles not faced by our male counterparts. 
We need not look further than our Facebook news feeds to recognize these challenges, and women’s resilience in the face of adversity. In January 2017, 5 million Americans joined together in solidarity to march in the name of gender equality. In February, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was silenced in her criticism of then-attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, and nevertheless, she persisted. In March, the “Fearless Girl” was installed before the iconic Wall Street “Charging Bull” to shed light on gender disparities in the finance industry. And in October, women around the world took to social media to share their stories as victims and survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment. Me too, we said, united in one voice to uplift our experiences and call for eradication of gender-based violence. 
That is why Hecuba matters. 
It matters that one of the top 20 private universities in the country has a female mascot to stand alongside her male counterpart. It matters that her face is the combination of faces of women who have seen, heard, smelled, tasted and lived different experiences. It matters that one of her hands is placed over her heart, while the other is outstretched to every passerby. 
Hecuba matters. And it matters that she is now leading the charge. 
Now more than ever, it is important that we come together, not only as women, but also as people of different races, faiths, genders, sexualities, ages and abilities to uplift and amplify the voices of women in leadership and women pursuing leadership. 
There are very few Trojans I can get behind. But Hecuba is definitely one of them. 
Arielle Yael Mokhtarzadeh
President, UCLA Undergraduate Students Association Council
Hecuba and Tommy Trojan are not USC’s mascots, Traveler is our mascot.  Better luck to the ruins next year. Not.
No, it’s just a dumb statue.

Zoe Cheng | Daily Trojan
Here it is, my last “Cross Section” column (of the semester, at least). This column will not continue into the spring semester, and the future after that is somewhat uncertain. Certainly there are a number of Daily Trojan website commenters who will be happy; maybe even the part of me that wants to focus now on building my screenwriting portfolio as I move through my final years at the cinema school is also happy. But after almost a year of publishing piece after piece, week after week, it feels right to conclude with a reflection of where this column took me, and where I began. 
I started writing “Cross Section” the semester after the November 2016 election, when I was feeling angry and powerful and nervous and sad, all at the same time. At first, I felt like I was surely giving someone more insight into how the world operates and how I see change happening in our society, for better or for worse — though I wasn’t sure whom. Who I was impacting, what impression I was leaving, if I was even making a dent in people’s consciences at all, I didn’t know. But almost immediately, I began to realize that I was. There was feedback, constructive and destructive, but both helpful. There were people who shared my articles, people who liked them and hated them, and that meant something to me. I was being read.
As I continued to write for the Daily Trojan, a curious phenomenon arose: an anxiety that grew large and ran concurrent to the deterioration of this country’s democratic principles. Working through them via “Cross Section,” a weekly routine, became almost therapeutic. But it was also hard: Part of me was telling myself that no one wanted to read another column with the same themes as the one before it, and the one before that. Still, I do believe that there are some things in this current political climate that deserve to be stated more than once. The fact that there are still people who do not matter to those in charge is an issue that will never diminish in urgency, even in the face of being considered repetitive.

Everything I’ve written has been a response to some news story (usually political, usually bad), and the very negative and sometimes almost passive tone these pieces can take on is not lost on me. Sometimes it felt like lamenting more than analyzing, my columns littered with the same set of buzzwords: privilege, systematic, patriarchy. And as time went on the columns got harder to write, indubitably because everything began bleeding together and I — like much of America — felt tired. Just as I felt defeated and worn down by politics, I also began to feel similarly about my columns: They were hard to write, sometimes emotionally so.
But there was one particular way that “Cross Section” helped me: through it, I pinpointed my voice. I defined it, and wore it proudly. There was no questioning that writing every week about a different political topic, sometimes controversial (although it still baffles me how calling for effective gun control legislation, or the simple idea that all people are created equal, is controversial) was both a creative and personal risk. 
From a very microcosmic perspective of the craft, I never truly know what I’ll be writing until I start writing it. That goes with all my work, creative or not. Outlining, preparing, research aside — it is the draw of creating characters and building story and the beauty of language that makes me love what I do. Writing “Cross Section” was a different type of writing than I have been used to, but I saw that I came to love it almost as much as I do my screenwriting. Over time, I told different stories with varying language. But the main character was always me — my voice, developing, changing. Though it may be hard to name, I leave this column with something I didn’t have when it began.
