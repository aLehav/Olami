Representatives from Unite Here Local 11 union and USC Hospitality employees met with Hospitality officials at the Radisson Hotel on Tuesday to discuss the issue of hiring subcontractors for summer housing work.

For the last 20 years, USC Hospitality employees who worked during the school year have been given the opportunity to work for USC Housing during the summer, according to representatives from the union. Both Hospitality and Housing are part of USC Auxiliary Services.
This year, however, employees said they were told USC Housing  is planning to subcontract employees from an outside company, cutting the number of USC employees who will have jobs over the summer from nearly 600 workers down to approximately 40.
USC Hospitality Director Kris Klinger, however, said as far as he is aware, employees will have job offerings and Housing is not planning to subcontract.
“Every year the university slows down as students go away for the summer and a number of venues are closed. This is not something new,” Klinger said. “The staff will be offered the opportunity to work with other USC Auxiliary Services or other summer employment. No one is planning to subcontract and maybe there will be a few less positions because of the opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.”
This year’s Hospitality workforce is larger than in previous years because of job openings in the Campus Center, so more employees will be competing for summer jobs.
Nonetheless, the union filed a formal grievance to ask Hospitality for specific information about the kind of work employees will be offered and why subcontracting will be occurring. This grievance was presented at the meeting Tuesday.
About 40 USC Hospitality employees walked to the Radisson with union representatives Tuesday, but were not allowed into the meeting room for about 30 minutes. Hospitality representatives informed union representatives only five to seven employees would be allowed inside, as large numbers would not foster a productive atmosphere in a room with a maximum occupancy of about 30.
Most employees were eventually allowed inside the room to hear the proceedings, but others were left waiting outside after the doors closed. When these employees attempted to enter, they were denied, as Hospitality said the room was at maximum capacity.
Even though most of the workers will be rehired when school resumes in the fall, according to union representatives, many employees said they rely on work at USC during the summer to support their families.
“Many of them have children and mortgages to pay,” said Jeimmy Summers, a cashier. “Some are already working two jobs and pulling double shifts. The exhaustion and stress is taking its toll for many employees and their families as they wonder how they will provide for their families this summer.”
The meeting at the Radisson followed a union meeting last Saturday, which took place at the United University Church. Employees who attended that meeting demanded answers from union president Tom Walsh about how he was reacting to this issue.
According to Summers, information about possible job openings off campus was relayed to employees who attended.
There is a petition going around to fight this issue please sign. Help our hospitality family we must stay united. Fight on!!!
Thank you all for your support! 
@ Max, I saw you at the meeting and meant to introduce myself, I couldn’t find you after the meeting.
Thank you for being there, I am glad you got to hear what’s going on.
@Ian, no one knows anything. Both the Union and USC haven’t given us any satisfying answers. Its more like beat around the bush in hopes we’ll forget all about it.  We haven’t forgotten that we have children to feed and no insurance for three months if my child gets sick. We won’t have the money or the hours to keep our insurance or pay out of pocket. Its not just about fighting for a job we’ve always had but its also about providing and protecting our families as well. 
USC talks about “the health and well-being of our students”, let’s not forget about the health and well-being of our employees as well. We have to step it up and show WE ARE the greatest University in the nation, not only are we great in academics and sports but let’s be greater in the way we treat our trojan family, our hard working brothers and sisters. Thanks again for all your support. 
Fight On!
Trojan alert
To whom ever will listen ..
Recently local 11 has filed a grievance againt usc on behalf of usc hospitality workers . The complaint on our behalf as a union is the officials of usc after 20+ years has chosen to use an outside company or agancy, to do the cleaning of the housing facilities this summer. Which is subcontracting, no matter how broaden the scope is. There for leaving hundreds of usc hospitality employees without a job for three months.
Leaving people who this university depends on to feed them, serve them and hold up the prestiges name of usc, hopeless. Telling the people who treat every single person whether they be student, faculty, staff or jus a visitor like family, they are not qualified any longer to do these housing tasks. These usc diretors who were put in charge of this family are not looking out for the Trojan name. They are letting us down by not giving us answers just a bunch of bold face lies.
Being a hospitality union employee that was in this so call meeting to discuss a solution. Was just filled with round talking lies. Sitting there with smurcks and closed minds because they have already made a decision and no one should question there actions. They werent able to give concrete evidence that they werent breaking a subcontracting aggrement per our union local 11s contract with usc.
So I’m calling all Trojans across the board to stand up. Help us fight for our livelihood. Stand with us and helps us fight for what has been ours for decades . Our summer jobs are all we got. Don’t allow them to take that away from their family. What would Trojans before us do. We need to stand and unite. Not go gently into that good night. We need to fight, fight, fight.
Fight on! Sincerely,
The misunderstood
Having advance notice of what the situation is would help.  When I was a TA, I was only paid for 10 months, and summer funding was not available, but I knew that was the case from the beginning, so I could plan my spending accordingly.  Here we are in mid-April, and the article sounds like nobody even knows what jobs are available, if any.  What a terribly stressful position to be in! When you have bills every month, you need to be able to plan for every month.
Having been in the meeting room myself yesterday as a student, I can say that USC could be doing a lot more to ensure the job security of its employees over the summer.  You’d think a school with an endowment of $3.7 billion would be able to keep its workers from worrying about being able to feed their families over the summer.
This university needs to step up the way it treats its workers–it’s laborers, contractors, and subcontractors, both here AND abroad.  Every time I think USC couldn’t possibly regress a smidge more, it proves me wrong.

Three males robbed a former USC student in his 27th Street residence early Tuesday morning.
According to a report from the Dept. of Public Safety, the three men knocked forcibly on the victim’s door and then pushed past him, entering his residence at Moon Apartments, a non-USC building.
After one of the suspects brandished a handgun, the three men stole cash and electronic devices from the victim.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said officers patrolling the area overheard loud voices coming from the residence.
The victim then contacted LAPD, which is investigating the crime.
Carlisle said although the incident did not involve a current USC student and did not occur at a USC-owned property, DPS still decided to issue a crime alert to students because it happened fairly close to campus in an area heavily populated by students.
“[Location] is usually part of the consideration in distributing a timely warning,” Carlisle said. “Since it happened just a short block from The Row, we felt it was our best judgment to issue the warning.”
The victim also told LAPD he recognized one of the suspects as someone he knew from the community.
Carlisle said because the victim knew and was able to identify one of the suspects, DPS is not considering the incident random at this point.
you have mentioned in moon apartments but nothing took place that night at that place. kindly check.

Though some students and faculty were concerned about a green liquid on campus, Phillip Solis, an administrative assistant at the Roski School of Fine Arts, said it was a test for leaks outside of Watt Hall. “[Facilities Management Services plumbers] use a green dye so that they can follow where the leaks originate and where they lead,” Solis said.

At 4:20 p.m. today, millions of people around the world are expected to congregate in public places and defy laws prohibiting the use of cannabis-based products.
The number of marijuana-related arrests on campus has decreased 20 percent since last year, while the number of marijuana-related referrals has increased, according to USC Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
Students in possession of one ounce or less of marijuana are referred to the Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, while those in possession of more than one ounce of marijuana are arrested.
According to Adam Leventhal, a USC associate professor of preventative medicine and psychology, college students might choose to use marijuana because of a genetic predisposition, the euphoric and calming effects the drug can deliver, or because of the way marijuana is represented in modern society.
Leventhal also said colleges often foster an atmosphere conducive to trying new activities and, subsequently trying new drugs.
“Marijuana is an example of a new experience that people can try for the first time when they are in college, like certain sports or sexual activities,” Leventhal said. “Some students are sensation seekers and thrive on those new, exciting experiences.”
Marijuana has been decriminalized in California since 2010, meaning possession of one ounce or less of marijuana is only punishable by a $100 fine. Possession of more than an ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor under state law, and results in a $500 fine and up to six months in jail.
Some USC students, including Justin Hunter, a freshman majoring in computer engineering and computer science, believe marijuana should be legalized.
“It is much less harmful than any legal drug such as drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco,” Hunter said. “It is [also] less harmful for the people around the user.”
DPS is not planning to alter its operations or policies today, according to Carlisle.
A study released earlier this month by the Partnership at Drugfree.org in conjunction with the MetLife Foundation reports the number of young adults who admitted to using marijuana increased from 32 percent in 2008 to 39 percent in 2010.
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, indicates the percent of teenagers using marijuana has not changed from 2007 to 2009. These statistics are more accurate, according to Adam Leventhal, a USC associate professor of preventative medicine and psychology.
Anyone who is willing to spend 5 minutes researching the truth about marijuana will learn that everything we have been taught about marijuana by the government are outright blatant lies. Marijuana has never directly caused a death in the history of history and its medicinal benefits far outweigh its so called “negative side effects”.
Marijuana was prohibited because the cotton and timber industry felt threatened by the progressing hemp industry. And today marijuana is kept illegal by the generous donations made forth by the pharmaceutical companies, alcohol industry, big tobacco corporations and various religious groups.
If you want to learn more about the real history of marijuana, watch a documentary called The Union: The Business Behind Getting High – absolutely eye opening…

Fresh off a run to the WNIT title game, the USC women’s basketball team added three standout recruits to pull in the nation’s No. 8 class, according to ESPN HoopGurlz.
Two of the players — 6-foot-1 forward Alexyz Vaioletama and 5-foot-7 guard Ariya Crook-Williams — rank among the top 16 players in the country according to ESPNU.  The third player, 6-foot-3 forward Deanna Calhoun, had her senior season cut short by a knee injury. Calhoun will redshirt her first season at USC.
“My coaches and I worked hard to recruit and sign talented, hard-working young women who are ready to help this program take the next step,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “Using the WNIT championship as a springboard, we are excited about the addition of Deanna, Ariya and Alexyz and the experience, size and depth they add to our veteran team.”
Both Vaioletama and Crook-Williams earned All-American honors in high school and have experience playing the USA Junior National teams, and will be counted on to bolster an experienced team that returns four starters. With their addition, USC has eight former high school All-Americans on its roster.
“We are excited for the immediate impact [Vaioletama] will have on next year’s team,” Cooper said.  “Her rebounding and inside-out scoring ability make her such a tough match-up.”
Cooper was just as effusive in his praise of Crook-Williams.
“With our already stellar backcourt, [her] athleticism and ability to get to the basket bring a new dimension to our offensive attack,” he said.

The USC men’s tennis team’s clinched the Pac-10 title Tuesday with a hard-fought 7-0 win over UC Irvine.
Although No. 1 junior Steve Johnson struggled in singles play, he still walked away with a victory, 6-4, 6-7 (10-2), against the Anteaters’ Chris Kearney.
Strong play · Freshman Ray Sarmiento won his singles and doubles matches Tuesday, helping lead the Trojans to victory over the Anteaters. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Johnson and No. 41 Kearney battled, but Johnson was finally able to seal the deal to keep his perfect record intact.
“I was not worried at all [about Johnson],” said freshman Ray Sarmiento. “He knows how to win in those situations.”
Every Trojan except Johnson handed the Anteaters losses in straight sets. Senior Jaak Poldma and senior Peter Lucassen won decisively, 6-3, 6-2 and 6-2, 6-1, respectively, in their last home matches of the regular season.
After trailing on court three, Nguyen rallied back to come out 6-4, 6-1 against Shan Sondhu. Freshman Emilio Gomez quietly and quickly pocketed a 6-2, 6-3 victory at the No. 5 spot in his match against Stege.
Sarmiento won his singles match against Irvine’s Ryan Cheung 6-1, 6-3 at the No. 4 spot.
USC’s three double pairs proved too much for UC Irvine. Sarmiento paired with junior Daniel Nguyen at No. 3 to defeat Sam Gould and Jon Kazarian, 8-4.
“We clicked,” Sarmiento said. “We were playing well together and working well together and moving well together. If we do that, then everything else happens.”
Poldma and sophomore J.T. Sundling played at the No. 1 spot and beat Kearney and Stephen Stege, 8-2. At No. 2, Johnson and Gomez took away an 8-3 win against Cheung and Fabian Matthews.
“We took care of business,” Sarmiento said. “We respect them as a team, too. We know they’re dangerous and they’re talented and we just came out and fought back.”
The victory gave USC its fifth consecutive 20-win season.
The Trojans next square off against crosstown rival No. 9 UCLA at 3 p.m. on Friday.
I was thinking the same thing, Steve B. Technically, I think they’ve already clinched at least a share of the title, because Stanford’s only loss was to USC. Maybe it was just worded wrong? C’mon, though, you have to know who is in the Pac-10 (or Pac-6 as it is in men’s tennis).
How do you clinch a Pac-10 title when defeating a non-conference opponent? That 1st paragraph could not have been a dumber statement. Maybe if it was volleyball it would have some merit although not Pac-10 (MPSF) to claim a title vs. Irvine.

Sunday football is as American as apple pie, reality TV and outdoor music festivals all put together.
For football fans, it’s a weekly holiday that makes hugging bartenders and high-fiving strangers acceptable — even if only for a few hours.
But an NFL lockout would put the kibosh on more than just bar lines and fantasy league invitations — it would be a direct shot to restaurants, cable and dish providers, advertisers and, of course, the city of Las Vegas.
Fans of the NFL would be forced to take a hiatus from a cavalcade of stars like Brady and Manning.
Granted, all of this is hypothetical, as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and his cronies still have plenty of time to negotiate new terms for a collective bargaining agreement with the players.
But it can’t hurt to entertain the potential of such a void — just ask Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott.
In an interview last month with Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, Scott suggested the conference had thought about playing Sundays, though obviously it is a vision predicated on many other plans.
“We certainly are monitoring the situation,” Scott said in the interview. “We have no plans in place at this time, but you want to be prepared and consider all options.”
He might call it being prepared, but I call it being quietly innovative.
The Pac-10 needs to shake things up, more than just adding two schools and changing a few logos. I’m talking the kind of move that makes people notice you, whether they want to or not.
What better way to make the most of an unfortunate situation than for the conference to seize control of a day already synonymous with watching football?
Who needs Rodgers and Brees when you have pro-prospects like Luck and Barkley willing to play for free each week?
I realize this would involve more than just some simple maneuvering by the NCAA, the Pac-10 and the networks that regularly broadcast Sunday games (CBS, FOX and ESPN).
But if ignorance can be bliss for a few moments, why shouldn’t Scott think long and hard about making this work if the chips fall his way?
The SEC and Big 12 have their own networks. The ACC broadcasts a majority of its games on ESPN. Even schools like TCU and Boise State, which hail from outside the major conferences, get more national exposure than any Pac-10 school.
At a time in the collegiate landscape when East Coast and Southeast biases have clouded perception of what the Pac-10 has to offer, isn’t this a chance to flip the script?
When approached about this same topic, Arizona Athletic Director Greg Byrne noted this wouldn’t even be the first time the conference has been asked to adapt to playing on different days of the week.
“Thursday night football hasn’t been around forever, and we adjusted to that,” Byrne said. “Sunday is a day a lot of people look to watch football. You would get good exposure.”
I come from the school of thought that any kind of publicity is good publicity.
That might seem moronic, but do you really want to root for a school that plays in the least-televised conference of any of the major six?
I don’t.
Sure, USC, Oregon and even Stanford get on ABC or ESPN from time to time. But imagine that every Sunday for three whole months.
It will never compare to the quality of play that exists at the professional level, but it will allow your school the opportunity to get more than an occasional showcase.
Call me a dreamer, but if things can’t be resolved in the NFL, this looks like a chance for the Pac-10 to make lemonade.

Keary Colbert lined up at wide receiver for USC during the team’s early morning practice Tuesday. Unfortunately for the Trojans, Colbert’s collegiate eligibility had already expired — in 2003.
Healthy · Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods has been one of the few USC wide receivers to participate in every spring practice. - Christopher Pham | Daily Trojan 
Though the 6-foot-1 wideout was primarily using Tuesday’s workout as part of a training regimen to stay in shape in an effort to re-launch his NFL career, Colbert’s participation served as a stark reminder of USC’s dwindling numbers this spring.
“It’s that time where guys have to push through,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “I’m sure numbers are down across the country, so it’s good for our guys.”
With sophomore wide receiver Markeith Ambles forced to undergo conditioning drills after being late for morning meetings, USC had just three scholarship players available Tuesday, allowing Colbert to line up opposite sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods during 7-on-7 drills.
Suffice it to say, there are fewer bodies available after 13 spring practices.
Despite the nagging depth issues that date back to last season, the team’s injury list has not stopped growing, as junior cornerback Tony Burnett and sophomore safety Demetrius Wright were both sidelined after suffering ankle injuries during Saturday’s scrimmage.
Burnett was only listed as day-to-day.
“They have me in a boot until further notice,” Burnett said. “I’ll be back out here on Thursday, but they want to make sure I’m safe and healthy for the scrimmage instead of irritating it. It’s for precautionary measures.”
Similarly, sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter and senior tailback Marc Tyler were sidelined with an ankle injury and a concussion respectively.
Yet Kiffin remains optimistic things will be better in the fall.
“You’re looking at 10 scholarship players who haven’t practiced this spring,” Kiffin said. “So when you add the 24 coming in, that’s 34 new scholarship players. Not only does it help your depth, but it makes your practices better.”
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley became visibly frustrated with a lack of cohesion among the corps of walk-on wide receivers and other players.
Toward the end of practice, the normally soft-spoken Barkley shouted at teammates following poor route running and other miscommunications that led to consecutive incompletions. Minutes later, the third-year signal caller threw a pass that was intercepted by sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey, who returned it about 70 yards for a touchdown.
“It’s frustrating, because you think some things should be going a certain way,” Barkley said. “I’m at the point where I know what’s going on and I know my reads. So when someone else messes up, it kind of throws me off.”
Kiffin, however, did not appear too concerned with Barkley’s altered demeanor.
“You want him to be aggressive, but you want him to be very intelligent in how he’s being aggressive,” Kiffin said. “What happens is when guys get frustrated, whether it’s because of them playing poorly, the players around them playing poorly or the score at that time, guys tend to make more errors. So that’s what you have to fight through.”
USC’s annual spring game, which will be held Saturday at 1 p.m., will not be televised or streamed live on USCTrojans.com, according to Kiffin.
Various programs this spring have had their spring games televised on networks such as ESPN. The Big Ten Network in particular is expected to broadcast all but one of its schools’ games live.
“They have 92,500 people there, so it makes for a different environment,” Kiffin said. “So it’s the difference between the South and being out here.”
The spring game, unlike other practices, will be open to the public and charges $10 admission for adults. Admission is free for students.
Does it seem to anyone else like something must be wrong with Kiffin’s strength and conditioning program?  This issue was not a crisis under Carroll.
quit your whining Seve B. Cough up the 10 bucks.
USC has a lot of nerve to charge admission for the upcoming Spring Huddle controlled scrimmage when half the regular players are missing in action. Know there are avenues to get a free ticket it just looks bad and cheap to ask for money for an inferior product.

Baseball coaches are paranoid about a lot of things. They’re paranoid about their signs being stolen, about making the wrong decision and about not doing enough.
Apparently, they’re also paranoid about five-run first inning leads.
Offensive firepower · Junior outfielder Alex Sherrod registered a season-high four RBIs, including a bases-clearing double in a five-run first inning, propelling USC to a 7-4 victory over LMU. It was the Trojans’ second win over the Lions this year. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
USC pounced on Loyola Marymount (20-15) for five runs in the first inning Tuesday and cruised to a 7-4 victory.
“Obviously it’s good because you have those runs,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “At the same time though, guys can get a little relaxed, a little complacent with a lead like that.”
Though the Trojans (16-20, 6-6) were outscored 4-2 over the next eight innings, the first provided them with plenty of cushion.
Junior catcher Kevin Roundtree was hit by a pitch from LMU starter Jacob Smigelski to lead off the game, and Smigelski proceeded to walk the bases loaded with one out.
Junior right fielder Alex Sherrod stepped up to the plate five for his last 11 and ripped a bases-clearing double down the right field line. He advanced to third on an error and then scored on a wild pitch, giving the Trojans a 4-0 lead even before two outs had been recorded.
USC tacked on one more in the first to give freshman starter Kyle Richter, in just his second career start, a quick five-run cushion.
And Richter did his part, throwing two perfect innings before being removed.
“Richter was great today,” Cruz said. “Can’t really complain about six up, six down.”
The Lions got two runs back in the third off senior pitcher Chris Mezger, and threatened again in the fourth. But Mezger got Loyola catcher Colton Plaia to ground out with two on to end the threat.
Loyola Marymount made it a two-run game in the sixth, but the Trojans got the run right back in the seventh as Sherrod knocked in his fourth RBI of the game.
Besides Richter and Mezger, three more Trojan pitchers tossed five innings of two-run ball.
Junior Ben Mount, who has been on a roll as of late, threw two and two-third innings with one earned. Mount has allowed just one run in his last five innings.
“Mount’s got a lot of confidence right now,” Cruz said. “His innings were big, because we wanted to save everybody for the weekend.”
Instead of the customary Friday-through-Sunday Pac-10 series, the Trojans will take on the Washington Huskies starting Thursday in Seattle to avoid playing on Easter.
This means, however, the pitching staff will lose an important day of rest.
“Mount was the only pitcher who went more than 30 pitches,” Cruz said. “So we expect everyone to be available on Thursday.”
The Trojans are on a bit of a roll themselves. They’ve won five of their last six games and six of their last eight, including a pair of wins over the Lions.
This weekend’s series against the Washington Huskies will give the Trojans a chance to move within one game of .500 for the first time since they were 3-4 on Feb. 27.
The Huskies, on the other hand, have struggled in recent weeks, losing their last four games in Pac-10 play, including a three-game sweep at the hands of California at home.
They have struggled at the plate during their recent skid, averaging just 1.75 runs per game.

The thousands of music fans who invaded Indio’s Empire Polo Grounds for Coachella have finally returned home, but polo players won’t be able to enjoy their playing fields for long.
On May 30, Stagecoach Festival, a two-day country music extravaganza, will be held in the same area as Coachella. And like Coachella, Stagecoach allows for onsite camping and features a slew of talented bands.
But otherwise, the two festivals are entirely different. Stagecoach fans tend to lean more toward the political right, and cowboy hats are as prevalent as smuggled drug paraphernalia are at Coachella.
Even though Stagecoach is less of a draw than Indio’s landmark festival, this year’s lineup will still bring a large crowd.
Growing up near the rural midwest, I was always adamantly against country music. Like most people my age, I always told people I liked all types of music except country.
As I journeyed to California and away from the beer-chugging, Country Music Television-watching folks from my hometown, however, I realized the immense ignorance behind that statement.
At its core, country music is what inspired the bands I listen to today. Rootsy, folksy, Americana music has manifested itself in various forms throughout popular music history, but it all began with good ol’ country. Classic rock groups owe a lot not only to influential blues musicians, but also to the country musicians that came before.
And, frankly, a lot of country music singers are badass. Willie Nelson has been arrested numerous times. Johnny Cash was one of the world’s earliest rock stars. Other, older outlaw country artists like Gram Parsons and Hank Williams, Jr. are similarly awesome. Relatively younger alt-country acts like Bright Eyes and Wilco are some of the most talented artists making music today.
Some alternative country acts will perform at Stagecoach, providing a break from the pop-like main stage acts. For instance, Phosphorescent, the stage name of multi-instrumentalist Matthew Houck, could fit in easily on any indie rock playlist, and the artist actually played an early afternoon Coachella set last weekend. The band might seem like a strange choice for Stagecoach, but Houck has got a folk/country vibe, but with a twist.
Another exciting, less mainstream festival act is the Jerry Douglas Trio. Jerry Douglas is known for his near-mastery of the Dobro, a type of resonator guitar manufactured by Gibson. His performances with the unique instrument are awe-inspiring, and his set with two other members will definitely be one of the festival’s highlight.
Although most think of rock and roll musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as guitar gods, Jerry Douglas’ Dobro skills put him up there with the greats.
Perhaps the most exciting performer on the Stagecoach bill is the legendary Leon Russell. Russell is the main draw behind several popular songs, since the multi-instrumentalist has recorded with artists like The Band, The Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra and Elton John. He was recently inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Much of Russell’s solo work is as talented and popular as his collaborations, and the 69-year-old musician’s set is sure to entertain at the festival.
In an era like this, in which bland and repetitive techno dominates the music world, country is a timeless genre to fall back on. When electronic beats and wobbly bass become too much to handle, soulful twang and straightforward lyricism about booze, women and regret are always comforting.
Country pop songs like those performed by Stagecoach’s three headlining acts still sting my ears with their terrible sound, but the smaller performers are just as entertaining as many of the bands that played Coachella.

In the world of underground music, is it possible to combine campy melodies with distorted guitars and still produce a successful album?
The Crystal Stilts clearly think so.
Photo courtesy of Force Field PR 
In their latest album, In Love with Oblivion, the Brooklyn-based band capitalizes on the peculiar genre of “noise pop,” a mixture of pop-like tunes and lyrics with more alternative-sounding instruments and effects like distortion, feedback and atonal vocals.
In the process, the Crystal Stilts have created an interesting, albeit lackluster, mash-up of catchy guitar solos and disappointing vocals that ultimately falls short.
In Love with Oblivion starts strong but the tracks dissolve into bland and forgotten melodies.
“Through the Floor” is one of the best tracks on the album and is worthy of its status as the album’s first single. The song begins with a light-hearted mixture of distorted guitar riffs and pop-inspired melodies. It is the shortest track, and one of only a few to include a harmony of vocals, lending it a ‘60s feel.
But, like every other song on the album, “Through the Floor” makes it frustratingly difficult to comprehend any of the lyrics.
Although the noise pop genre is infamous for using whispery, echoed vocals, the Crystal Stilts make no attempt to experiment with their lyrics.
Most of the album’s tunes are so blatantly popish you almost feel cheated because they are difficult to sing along to.
Lead singer Brad Hargett offers the most minimal range possible for a vocalist: His monotone voice is characteristic of noise pop music, but it shouldn’t be so utterly deadpan and incomprehensible that his presence serves no purpose.
In the end, it only distracts from the flamboyantly catchy guitar solos.
In every song, Hargett’s voice drowns helplessly in the background noise. Often, he winds up sounding completely disengaged from the instruments altogether.
To be fair, Hargett’s vocals aren’t always superfluous. In “Flying into the Sun,” Hargett’s voice lends raw meaning to the bittersweet feeling of the lyrics.
The song is the album’s most pop-inspired track, with more upbeat instrumentals and lovey-dovey lyrics than the others.
But the contrast of Hargett’s depressingly atonal voice with the cheerful melody makes for a song that is both sweet and sorrowful.
Another gem is “Shake the Shackles,” which boasts a catchy opening that captures you almost instantly. Unlike in most of the songs, Hargett’s voice does not detract from the melody.
The track also does not use distortion as much as other songs on the album, making it cleaner and more euphonious.
About halfway through the album, however, the Crystal Stilts appear to have lost interest in trying to create songs different from one another.
None of the last four tracks are the least bit memorable, especially when compared to the much stronger and more versatile first half of the album.
Ultimately, In Love with Oblivion makes a decent effort at breaking out of the norm.
There are both high and low points, leaving an array of unique but generally forgettable songs.
But through those peaks, it’s clear that the Crystal Stilts have the capacity for success.
The band just needs to figure out a way to produce an album in which more tracks hit the bullseye.
Urg Daily Trojan. This band is so good.

YouTube, along with other video streaming sites, has become an avenue for fans to relive their favorite sports moments. Dwight Clark’s touchdown in the 1982 NFC championship game, Michael Jordan’s jumper in the ’98 finals, the list goes on.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately, the only way you’ll be able to see any highlights from Major League Baseball is through video game re-creations of them.
MLB commissioner Bud Selig has worked to ensure no MLB highlight videos can be streamed anywhere except on the teams’ official sites.
If videos are posted elsewhere, the league immediately sends a cease and desist letter. It’s a no-nonsense operation, and it is holding the league back.
Online videos should be a medium for younger fans to learn the history of the game, without having to sift through all of Ken Burns’ Baseball, and for devoted baseball followers to revisit the memorable moments — no-hitters, diving catches, World Series wins — that fans live for.
The MLB has to embrace the modern age and create an official channel on YouTube, much like the NHL and NBA. The advertising revenue should make the venture nearly as profitable as the league’s current system, which has worked for every other sport.
By funneling all the potential traffic from YouTube to MLB.com, Selig believes he can maximize profit.
By diverting any fan who wants to watch an MLB highlight on YouTube to MLB.com, his site attracts more views and thus more money from advertisers.
This strategy puts the ball in Selig’s court, enabling the league to charge whatever it deems reasonable. If the league allowed YouTube to stream videos, it would lose that control because YouTube individually handles advertising revenues.
But the league would still be able to make that money through other avenues.
YouTube is a premier site for video hosting and sharing, and the traffic on the site easily surpasses that of the official team websites. Offering MLB highlight videos will only increase that traffic and increases revenue for YouTube and MLB.
Though there wouldn’t be much of an impact on profits, the impact on fan engagement would be immense.
Currently, the MLB only streams videos of recent highlights. Developing a YouTube channel and uploading vintage highlights will broaden its fan base, while also doing a great service to lifelong baseball fans.
The major issue for the MLB, though, is that people are starting to get angry.
Many members of the media have complained about the league’s archaic policy on video sharing. The league should take corrective action before this becomes an even more public issue.
The convenience of YouTube, and its reputation as a reliable, streamlined platform make it the home of participatory culture in today’s society, and the MLB has made a huge mistake by dispersing its content only into affiliated team sites. It has made these videos impossible to find, impossible to relive, and it has kept the fan experience behind the times.
It’s time for Selig to make the logical move to appeal to the younger, more technologically inclined demographic. These are the people who will determine the MLB’s future, and they need to be able to learn about its past.

Recent studies have shown outdoor activities are more than just a nice way for students to spend a day or two — they’re vital to their mental and physical health.
According to a study by Frances “Ming” Kuo, director of the Landscape and Human Health Laboratory at the University of Illinois, access to nature and green environments enhances self-discipline and mental health overall.
“In greener settings, we find that people are more generous and more sociable,” Kuo said to EurekAlert.org, an online science news service.
During these last few weeks of class, students often get so buried in work they need something that refreshes them and puts them in the positive mindset to work in the first place.
Not only can outdoor activities help us refocus, they can also improve our school work by lowering our stress levels.
Admittedly, after classes, homework and the internships activities like hiking are probably not at the top of most people’s list.
Still, last Monday, I decided to ditch my bed and blankets and venture to Topanga State Park. In complete and utter solitude, I hiked the Topanga Park Loop, an eight-mile hike offering many scenes of natural beauty.
I realized wandering around Topanga State Park that Kuo was right — nature really does have a positive impact on people.
It might seem like a waste of time, but in the midst of studying for finals and writing term papers, getting out of the city is a worthwhile investment.
During these last crucial weeks, taking a break to experience the outdoors can also increase students’ physical ability to effectively study for finals.
Kuo also found exposure to parks and green environments have a positive impact on physical health. Spending time in green environments can lead to increased cardiovascular capacity as well as improved immune system functions.
In a fast-paced environment, students might not realize the negative impact of living in the middle of  an urban city.
Forbes magazine recently ranked Los Angeles as America’s second-most stressful city, finding “22.8 percent of Angelinos reported that their health was less than good.”
If anyone feels compelled to go on a hike during the break between classes and finals, it will be a rewarding experience unlike anything USC’s campus and surrounding sidewalks can offer.
 
David Morris is a sophomore majoring in English (creative writing).
Who would have thought that breathing smoggy air from all directions 24 hours a day, being surrounded by throngs of people, incessant blaring of sirens and helicopters, IN ADDITION to rigorous academics, would have a detrimental impact on people’s mental health? You don’t say!
As much as urban environments facilitate networking and relationships to an extent, they also severely impact people’s wellbeing on an individual level.  Add to that the fact that SC’s downtown locale offers very little in the realm of nature and solitude, and you’re kinda screwed. Manhattan and NYC as a whole are a fraction of LA’s size yet they still had the forethought and prioritization to designate and cherish a place like Central Park.  That there is nothing even remotely comparable in the heart of LA is a sad state of affairs.  Welp, too late now.
David,   I am a writer who lives in Topanga Canyon.   I completely agree with the virtue of time spent walking in nature.   I do it daily.    Inspiration and solutions come as i free my mind and get the heart rate up a bit.  Then back to work.   
Make it a life long habit.    Not bragging, but motivating you,  such a regime earned me a summa cum laude upon graduating from UCLA.   Now in my 70s I’m still at it.    My doctor says 70 is the new 50.   It surely keeps the brain and body going.
Wishing you a long creative life!

Arizona’s Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill Monday that would have required presidential candidates to prove they were American citizens before their names could be placed on the state ballot.  The bill passed the state House last week and now will not become law unless legislators vote to override Brewer’s veto.
Under the law, Arizona’s secretary of state would have the final say on whether a potential candidate was eligible to be included on the ballot or not.  “As a former Secretary of State, I do not support designating one person as a gatekeeper to the ballot for a candidate,” Brewer said.
The bill coincides with constant allegations that President Obama was not born in the United States, a conspiracy that has not died down since Obama’s inauguration.  President Obama’s 2008 campaign produced a “certification of live birth,” a document similar to a birth certificate.
Nearly 75 percent of Americans believe that Obama was definitely or probably born in the United States, while more than four in 10 Republicans believe the president was probably or definitely not born in America.

Joining the beloved USC alumna Kina Grannis once again on her upcoming tour is the newly developed musical act Imaginary Friend.
Sporting a perfectly shaped beard and slick dressing style, Imaginary Friend has been captivating audiences around the country with his lyrics, soothing voice and a personable attitude.
Stumbling into a career of music after winning his college’s annual music competition with his friend Taylor Rice, Imaginary Friend has embarked on a musical journey that will surely bring him success.
As Rice went on to join the popular and critically acclaimed Local Natives, Imaginary Friend decided to go solo. He grabbed his guitar, recorded a few songs and the rest is history. Now, with only an EP to his name, he has already gained much success touring with Grannis on her 2010 tour.
The melodic yet tranquil guitar riffs in his ballads provide for a great listen and his lyrics, charged with raw emotion, will leave you wanting more.
Instead of writing cheesy tunes about love, he writes about assurance, growing up and waiting. He is a great talent with what seems like a bright future ahead.
My Top Picks: “Wherever You Go,” “We’ll Be Okay” and “Chasing Ghosts.”

After successfully collaborating on the multi-cultural event “¿Qué Pasa, APASA?” the Asian American Pacific Student Association and the Latino Student Assembly hope to encourage cultural groups around campus to collaborate.
Crafts · Students participate at the orgami booth, one of the eight booths at “¿Qué Pasa, APASA?” an event co-hosted by LSA and APASA. Other booths included language booths and food from Panda Express and LaTaquiza. - Courtesy of Monica Rivera 
¿Qué Pasa, APASA? was held last week to bring two cultural communities together to share knowledge about their culture, according to Steven Almazan, incoming executive director of LSA.
This event was created to address the lack of collaboration between the two groups. Though LSA has worked with organizations such as the Black Student Union and APASA on an internal basis before, they had never worked with APASA to put on events to highlight both the different cultures and their commonality.
Carlos Hernandez, director of LSA, said the event was to help bridge the gaps between the two groups so people can find common ground.
“People don’t realize that our cultures have a lot in common with each other in terms of values and traditions,” Hernandez said. “It’s actually interesting to me that there wasn’t more collaboration until now.”
Amy Huang, incoming executive director of APASA, said she wants future events to highlight similarities.
“There are more similarities between the Latino and Asian Pacific American communities than differences, such as issues of immigration,” Huang said. “And I would like our events to highlight those similarities so that our communities may build multicultural coalitions to achieve our common goals.”
Beverly Chiang, vice president of Sigma Phi Omega, an Asian sorority on campus, said she is excited about the possibilities of these types of collaborations and the impact this collaboration could have on the rest of the school.
“There’s not that much of a difference between all of us. We are all USC students, a part of this Trojan family regardless of our culture and background,” Chiang said. “It’s really encouraging to be at a school where we constantly try to embrace these diversities among the students instead of suppressing it.”
Hernandez deemed the event a success because other communities might see the event as encouragement to work with other cultural groups.
“By having these avenues for them to connect, we are able to facilitate the future and that’s why I think it was so successful,” Hernandez said.
Huang said she has high hopes for next year.
“I am hoping that ¿Qué Pasa, APASA? is only just the beginning to a more collaborative relationship between LSA and APASA,” Huang said. “In addition to the social and cultural aspects of this event, we hope to program more educational and advocacy-based events next year.”
Hernandez also hopes other groups would see the event as an example of how beneficial the sharing of knowledge can be.
“It sets an amazing example for other communities on campus to realize that in addition to them that there are other organizations on campus doing amazing things,” Hernandez said. “They are doing great things, we are doing great things, and lets do it together.”
Hernandez said he also believes collaboration among student groups can only have positive effects.
“We are all students, trying to do great things and we all cared about our communities,” Hernandez said.  “We can do something great with these common goals. As simple as it sounds, it just creates more friends.”
This is a cool collaboration that I hope will lead to more.  However, this article is extremely sloppy.  The two organizations that planned this event were Latino Student Assembly and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly (APASA).  The writer (who needs to fact check) and the story editor (who needs to learn how to edit) call APASA the following names in the article:  the Asian American Pacific Student Association and APSAS.  And the link in the article is to a student affairs department (APASS) and not to APASA’s website.  I hope corrections will be made to reflect the correct names and acronyms of the organizations involved and in the interest of accuracy.  Also, the tags at the end of the article have the incorrect organization name, as well.
