On Thursday night, Monica Bill Barnes & Company, led by Monica Bill Barnes and Robbie Saenz de Viteri, visited USC to put on “The Running Show,” a dance performance that combines sports and theater to tell the story of a dancer’s life and what it means to keep dancing as she ages. 
“I think it really kind of takes people through the timeline of what it means to pursue dance.” Saenz de Viteri said. 
The company held auditions for the show Sept. 24th, selecting 13 dancers from the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, and began rehearsals later that same day. With just six days of rehearsal, Bill Barnes and Saenz de Viteri created a new version of the show.
Bill Barnes choreographed for “The Running Show,” as well as dances throughout the entirety of the performance.
Saenz de Viteri is the show’s self-proclaimed “chairperson.” Despite his lack of professional dancing experience in comparison to Bill Barnes, he remains onstage for the whole show, playing the role of a sportscaster compiling clips from the interviews he conducted. 
“I think we have a lot of shared sensibilities, but we have no shared skills,” Saenz de Viteri said. “Monica is an incredibly trained dancer, and I don’t know anything about dance, and I think so much of our collaboration is sort of rooted in that very thing.” 
This is not a show that was created overnight, but something that took a lifetime of experience and years of work. 
“There’s maybe a year or two of a process where we’re just collaborating to create, to try and understand what kind of event to make,” Bill Barnes said. 
When watching, the performance seems to be a combination of both dance and sports, making its name extremely fitting. “The Running Show” is unique from other shows in that it is different each time that it is performed. While Bill Barnes teaches the choreography alongside fellow dancer Flannery Gregg, Saenz de Viteri sits down to interview each individual dancer. Then, when the show is put on, Bill Barnes’ choreography is combined with snippets of Saenz de Viteri’s interviews, creating a story about the life of a dancer.
While the Kaufman students made up the largest part of this cast, the show also included 12-year-old Jada Turner’s ballet solo, as well as the story and dance of 77-year-old Gerri Houlihan. Both of these two performers were incredible, bringing to the stage dancers from all stages of life.
The subject matter of “The Running Show” is unique on its own, but the show truly stands out when looking at the story being told. Part of the story comes from Bill Barnes’ own life and struggles of dancing as she ages. But, just as importantly, it includes the stories of the Kaufman School’s dancers, such as Simone Peterson, a freshman majoring in dance. 
“It was definitely daunting the first time I heard my voice on stage, […] I’ve never actually danced to my voice,” Peterson said. “Monica and Flannery are just so amazing [at] what they do, and I’m so glad I got to work with them.” 
Not only was Peterson dancing to their own voice, but also hearing Saenz de Viteri use them to tell a story. The story of “The Running Show” is not simply Bill Barnes’ or Saenz de Viter’s, but the story of who know and what it is like to grow up and identify as a dancer for the majority of their lives.
“Trying to involve a really large cast of local performers was just nothing we’d ever done before,” Bill Barnes said. 
Not only does “The Running Show” have a variety of dancers from across the world, but it is a completely different performance each time that it is shown, making the experience incredibly special for both dancers and audience members alike.

Upon entering the warm-lit halls beside the Ray Stark Family Theater on a cozy Wednesday night, the scent of garlic rice and freshly fried lumpia rolls danced in the air as attendees awaited the screening of Filipino superhero film “Lumpia with a Vengeance.” Friends, families and members of USC’s Troy Philippines student organization mingled with plates of crispy lumpia rolls blanketed in sweet chili sauce as they admired tables of comic books featuring “Kuya” (Tagalog for elder brother). 
The film depicts a passionate high school girl, Rachel, alongside Kuya—the hero-protagonist—fighting crime by launching a lumpia into the mouths of the mysterious villain’s allies who plot to ruin her parents’ wedding. The hero role of Kuya in their cinematic universe alternates between two brothers – one of which is seeking justice for childhood culture-induced bullying that his older brother faced. Despite absurdity in weapon choice and referencing commonalities of “stereotypical” Filipinos in a comedic light, the film highlights the serious intercultural struggles of physical appearance, academic comparison and dialect differentiation. 
The screening of the action-comedy indie film was followed by a live Q&A session with Patricio Ginelsa, the film’s director, an alumnus of the School of Cinematic Arts and arts laboratory manager at the Marshall Experiential Learning Center.  Heartwarmingly, Ginelsa discussed after the screening that Filipino communities nationwide kick-started his dream project by crowdfunding the nine-years-in-the-making movie. Creating his own “Deep Fried Universe” developed from his maturation of thought to withstand industry pressure to not make the film too Filipino.
Nikia Fenix, a freshman majoring in media arts and practice, noted her amazement to witness “so many Filipino last names and creative voices who are working in all aspects of production.”
The predominantly Filipino cast and crew reflected the authenticity in the storytelling of the plot-driven film. The elements of cultural relatability and “being in an audience of Filipinos who tend to be…dramatic” elevated the “emotional and dramatic” plot twists, Fenix said.
“Someone who looks like us who has the same culture,  understanding the jokes…only Filipino people [would] understand…was just very unique,” Jessica Labrador, a junior majoring in law, history and culture, said. “Up until now…a lot of Filipino people have been very behind the scenes for a lot of big movies. But there hasn’t been too much [representation] in terms of a feature film surrounding a primarily Filipino character.[Only those] who take inspiration from Filipinos…[or] who have those kinds of features. Explicit representation rather than just the reference here and there and actually having Filipino culture  be the forefront of a story.”
Almost a decade in the making, genuine community shined throughout the film through the use of VHS-taped flashbacks of the real married couple portrayed in the film falling in love in their young adult years, in addition to video-call footage of Ginelsa and his team reaching their $30,000 Kickstarter goal. 
As an aspiring actor, Daevenmar Mendoza, a freshman majoring in theater, was particularly touched by the film. 
“Seeing myself represented on screen is something that can truly inspire me…Growing up, there weren’t a lot of Filipino icons that I could look up to in Western culture, but it’s those little steps that we made with producing our own films …that we can see things like this, inching towards that broader scale of being more representative in the larger media,” Mendoza said. 
Particularly, the common shared memory of children bringing ethnic foods to school and feeling ashamed of their lunch’s “foreign” scents was a pivotal moment in “Kuya’s” mission in seeking “revenge.” The title works conjointly with this theme, in that lumpia is the standard poster image (and often the only known basis representation of Filipino culture). The weaponized portrayal of lumpia is a fighting symbol for Filipinos hoping to break the barriers of white-dominated Hollywood.
The three-course events of the night — reception, screening and Q&A — satisfied the hunger for Filipino representation in the superhero and comic genre on the silver screen almost as much as the crispy lumpia that catalyzed a gateway for Filipino-Americans in superhero films.

You’ll never get speed and convenience like we have here. America is the only country where you can wake up at 2 p.m.; get drive-thru all-day breakfast in under two minutes; order groceries and have them packaged and put into your car trunk for you (and even that’s more energy than home delivery); pop out of the car to buy a gun really quick at the Walmart down the street (just bring that ID); and dress absolutely horribly while doing the whole thing.
I mean, who would trade living in Europe for what we have here? When studying abroad in Paris, I had to go to three different grocery stores to do my weekly shopping: one for meat and cheese, a farmers market for produce and Monoprix for non-perishables. Who would trade the charm of knowing the butcher for the eye-glance you give the Whole Foods delivery guy? 
We have no idea how easy we have it! 
All that being said, for the entirety of my high school career, I thought I hated America. 
After Donald Trump was elected president, I, along with all of my other high school classmates, declared we were moving to Canada. And this time we were sure we meant it. We said it after Sandy Hook and during the #MeToo movement, but this time we really meant it. The morning after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, my high school held an emergency assembly complete with a moment of silence. Girls were crying in the hallway and all we could muster was, “I’m moving to Canada.” 
We thought all our problems would disappear in this northern oasis. Look at Canada! Look at that healthcare! 
Of course, none of us actually moved, and none of us will. Ruth Bader Ginsburg died leaving many without hope for the Supreme Court, and we still did not move. Roe v. Wade got overturned, taking the right of bodily autonomy from millions, and we still did not move. The Equal Rights Amendment continues to fail, and we still do not move. The lack of gun control has led to the death of over 30,000 lives and we are still here. 
America is tainted with injustice and contemptible decisions, but we have to abandon this mindset that we have to leave the country when it gets this bad because deep down, we know that leaving the country does not mean fully leaving its problems behind.
I left the country, albeit temporarily, and I did not abandon my grief for America. Being a citizen, the attachment I feel to America’s journey and striving for better is ingrained within me. As much as I wanted moving to Europe to be my saving grace from any “American guilt,” I did not detach myself when I moved to study abroad; I simply saw America from the outside.
Our freedom of speech, our life of convenience and our ability to consume all the media we want have become part of our lives, but we forget that this isn’t the norm for everyone in the world. Our freedom has come with the habit of taking our privileges for granted.
This is not in any way my pitch to become a nationalist. I hold the view that the most patriotic thing to do is to critique, vote and advocate for the betterment of the country. I also don’t believe in responding to legitimate failures of our systems with a remark about how lucky we are to even be here. And I certainly don’t believe in the, “if you don’t like it, leave” argument that completely ignores how progress is made. Studying abroad this past year only reinforced these beliefs.
Leaving the country, after not liking it, did not solve my qualms with America. If all the people who want better from this country leave, what will it turn into? Fighting for justice is an unfairly-placed burden on those who are oppressed by the system. The ones truly harmed by the policies and injustice in America are the ones who don’t have the resources to leave when they fought to come here for refuge. 
As American citizens, we all should rally behind the rhetoric that we will not abandon our country when it fails us or our neighbors. This kind of national spirit is unique and it is part of all of us, whether we want to admit it or not. Those who benefit from flawed systems owe it to their neighbors to improve the system for them, not reap the benefits and claim that those not at the top do not deserve to be there. Running away is the easy way out. Let’s not add cowardice to the list of this country’s flaws.

As Hurricane Ian pummeled through Florida Wednesday afternoon, residents across the state were already enduring the storm’s destruction: large-scale power outages plunged over two million residents into darkness, winds reached 150 mph and halted transportation and tourism with the cancellation of over 2,000 flights and seaport shutdowns. Hurricane Ian is marked as one of the strongest storms to strike Florida, prompting alarm from students affected by Ian, as well as those affected by Hurricane Fiona, which recently hit Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria which hit the same region five years before.
Thalia Colón García, a senior majoring in acting for stage, screen and new media, is one of many Puerto Rican students living away from home while Hurricane Fiona struck the island.
“It was difficult to get in contact with my family because the whole island lost signal,” Colón García said. “About two days passed by when I finally got in contact with my mom.”
The disaster that struck Puerto Rico last week is reminiscent of Hurricane Maria, which slammed the island in September 2017. The death toll reached 2,975 with damages reaching $90 billion. Some households were without power for a whole year. 
Colón García was with her family when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and remembers the devastation it caused, leaving the island in a still-delicate state. 
“We’re still dealing with the consequences of Hurricane Maria,” Colón García said. “Even though Fiona wasn’t as strong as Maria, we’re not as strong to deal with more hurricanes because we are still trying to recover from Maria.”
Colón García believes that climate change is playing a role in the types of hurricanes that are making more and more appearances. She explained that Puerto Rico’s very hot climate and warm waters are factors that contribute to an increasing number of hurricanes. 
“Those conditions are particularly required and are essential for all these natural disasters to occur,” Colón García said.
Last week, Hurricane Fiona began as a Category-1 storm ripping through Puerto Rico, causing intense flooding and affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. A power outage hit the entire island leaving nearly 3.3 million residents without access to power. As a result, around 746,000 homes and businesses have been without power for over a week since the hurricane passed through. Authorities in Puerto Rico also revealed that 25 people have lost their lives. 
Only days later, Hurricane Fiona traveled up the coast and ravaged Canada’s eastern seaboard. Hundreds of thousands of residents in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Newfoundland and New Brunswick were affected. Although the storm was considered a post-tropical cyclone by the time it made landfall on the coastal provinces of Canada, Fiona retained its hurricane-speed winds. The flooding that resulted has left many without power. Two people from the affected provinces have died and one person remains missing. 
Hurricane Fiona created effects stretching further than just the eastern coastline and Caribbean islands. 
Diego Delgado, a sophomore majoring in architecture, personally experienced how Hurricane Maria affected his community and believes that the changing climate is having an effect on hurricane patterns. 
“Hurricane Maria went from a tropical storm to a Category-3 in a day which was really sudden,” Delgado said. “Because waters are getting a lot warmer, hurricanes are getting a lot more fuel and are moving slower which can cause a lot more flooding and prolonged wind.”
As Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida with Category-4 strength, there is unease about the increasingly cataclysmic effects of hurricanes. Noah MacDonald, a junior majoring in English and theater, recalls how Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Irma devastated Florida in the past. 
“As climate change is drastically affecting our world, it seems like it’s not a coincidence,” MacDonald said. 
He also predicts that contacting people back home might prove to be difficult.
 “I don’t know if I’ll even have signal to call my parents because in the past, the cell phone towers have been out of order,” MacDonald said. “It causes a lot of worry and disruptions in our day to day life.”
He commented on how, when storms hit, particular areas are more prone to destruction than others. 
“In my childhood, I have lived in South Florida, near mobile home communities. These mobile homes are often built before all of the safety regulations for hurricanes,” MacDonald said. “They’re made out of poor material that can’t withstand the destruction of the winds.”
MacDonald said that certain regions face amplified consequences each hurricane season. 
“Every hurricane always causes so many problems for the islands, specifically Puerto Rico,” MacDonald said. “It seems like they’re always out of luck. When a hurricane comes, then the next one comes and they never seem able to catch up.”
Delgado explained that receiving supplies and aid after the hurricanes has always been a challenge in Puerto Rico. However, despite the barriers, he emphasizes the perseverance of the people. 
“These are the people who go forward,” Delgado said. “We are usually the ones that clean up and help each other rebuild the island.”
MacDonald highlighted the importance of community and the way people provide support in the aftermath of these natural disasters.
 “I have seen firsthand how our communities help each other. When people are needing a place to stay, there’s always family and friends,” he said. “We are still trying to help each other and come together during the times that tragedy hits.”

Therapy can be expensive, and as the selfless, class warrior that I am, “Advice from Dr. Blingspice” is back by popular demand. No one is better qualified at solving problems they have never experienced than I am.
With a possible recession looming, I figured I should give back the best way I can: being nosy and giving my input where I have no business. I have no money to offer, but if there’s one thing I can, it’s talking too much.
Some things never change: more dating app troubles, roommate issues and employment struggles. Dr. Blingspice is back with six semesters of college experience, ready to help with all the miscellaneous problems you may have.
How do you stop attracting weirdos on apps as a woman?
Dating apps are weirdo-central. If there’s one thing the virtual environment has done, it’s enabled people to act out of pocket and communicate without repercussions. What isn’t — and shouldn’t be — said out loud can be sent via Tinder message, and chances are, you’ll never meet the weirdo to confront them about their weirdo behavior. It enables people to be heathens.
Unless you have a furry suit on in your profile or your bio says you want to be impregnated, there’s not much you can do to stop attracting weirdos. The weirdos will always find a way into your matches, and you shouldn’t blame yourself for who you attract. Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as weirdo-repellant and the best you can do is to ignore their messages until your dream man comes around.
If you’re scared you’re doing something to attract them, it’s helpful to ask a friend for their opinion on your profile. Without realizing it, you may have a few words in your bio that are putting a weirdo target on your back. If you’re not sending the wrong message, blame it on the dating environment instead of yourself — weirdos will be weirdos.
How do I tell my roommate that their passive aggression is too much to handle?
Be confrontational. If there’s one thing that scares a person who’s passive-aggressive, it’s addressing the situation head-on.
Next time you see them, ask them, “what’s your issue?” Turn the passive aggression into plain old aggression! Have a brawl! Take some swings until you figure out why they are acting sideways.
On a serious note, arrange a meeting, tell them you’ve been noticing their behavior and encourage them to be straightforward about any problems they have with you. Life’s too short to be using brain power and guesstimating whether or not someone has an issue with you. 
Especially when you’re living with the person, you don’t want unnecessary negativity in your own home. It’s your safe space. The only solution is confrontation and communication for a healthy roommate relationship. Even if it makes the apartment tense, then at least the roommate will know to tell you next time there’s an issue.
I’m worried I won’t get an internship at any of the companies I’ve applied to. What advice do you have?
Internships and jobs during college are not the end-all-be-all; college has curated a culture that ramps up our employment anxieties and makes us career-obsessed. While it’s important, there are other things to life than work.
Don’t take rejection as the end of your career; you’re just starting. Everything ends up falling into place, and there is no shame in having to work at a smaller company. There are always opportunities that sneak around to you when you least expect them. Even if you get rejected for your dream internship, it’s likely because there’s a better opportunity waiting for you around the corner. Not everyone will land their ideal internship at the same time.
For the time being, prepare for your interviews and make use of your school’s career services. Polish up your resume, touch up your cover letter and don’t shut out any opportunities. There’s a solution to everything, and you have decades ahead of you to figure everything out. Continue growing your network, and always remember, life’s not about a job.

The USC Persian Academic and Cultural Student Association organized two vigil nights on campus on Sept. 21 and Sept. 23 in remembrance of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman who died in police custody. 
Amini died on Sept. 16 in a Tehran hospital three days after the morality police arrested her for violating Iran’s hijab law. Since Sept. 23, her death has sparked large-scale protests across the nation in at least 40 cities demanding an end to the conservative dress and hijab law. 
According to NPR News, police arrested Amini, who was originally from Kurdistan province, in her brother’s car during a visit to Tehran to see family members, sent her to a detention center to receive training on hijab laws before transferring her to a hospital where she passed away due to a heart attack — based on the Iran authority’s claim. 
However, Amini’s family disputed the assertion and stated with the support of eyewitnesses that the police beat Amini after they arrested her. Reports reveal that Amini’s death was caused by a fracture in her skull due to heavy blows to her head, according to the Associated Press. 
Maideh Masiha Orangi, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law heard the news of Amini’s death after returning from a religious trip to Iraq. 
“It was really odd, unsettling to see that same religion I felt so close to misportrayed and misused in the enforcement of hijab as well as resulting in the death of someone,” Orangi said. 
Ever since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran as a result of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran’s “hijab and chastity” law requires all women and girls over the age of nine to wear a headscarf in public. 
“I think it’s not fair for you to be able to say someone is misportraying or miswearing the hijab when they themselves did not choose to do so … I think women should have the choice to wear hijab and also to preserve the sacredness of hijab because when it’s being forced, the value of it, the importance of it goes down,” Orangi said.
Negar, another Iranian student who is not comfortable disclosing her full name, worries of political retaliation from the Iranian government. She said she felt “shocked, angry and terrified” after hearing the news.  
“I put myself in Mahsa’s shoes and all the people who are currently being killed in Iran and I believe that this could have happened to any one of us, not just Mahsa,” Negar said. 
USC students showed their sympathy by bringing flowers, which according to PACSA symbolize Amini’s life and memory, as tributes to the vigils. Orangi attended both of them and valued the opportunity to connect with other students. 
“A lot of us feel this guilt that we are seeing what’s happened to our country, to people online, but we have the privilege of being in the United States and not experiencing that,” Orangi said. “I think us being able to have these vigils in these communities is really important and a lot of us tend to connect with others … I guess [to] dispel some of the guilt we feel by not being able to directly help our country as much.”
Negar also called for support from non-Iranian students at USC.
“The main purpose of [vigil nights] is that they want more support from non-Iranians and they want other students to stay in solidarity with us, [to] inform others about the current situation in Iran,” Negar said.  
Protest against Iran’s religious dictatorship in response to Amini’s death still continues. Since Oct. 2, at least 133 protesters, including children, have been killed, according to Iran Human Rights, a non-profit human rights organization in Norway. 
Internet services in Tehran and other parts of the country were confirmed by NetBlocks, a watchdog organization that monitors governance of the Internet, to be partially restricted on Sept. 16 when the protest first broke out. Instagram and WhatsApp were restricted nationwide as well on Sept. 21, followed by massive shutdowns of national mobile networks. 
“In the past five years or so, I would say protest, while starting with reasons, very quickly take on a broader anti-government tone, and this was no exception,” said Ciruce Movahedi-Lankarani, a professor of Middle East Studies at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “What is different this time is the way that women have been at the forefront of the movement.”
Movahedi-Lankarani also recognized that shutting down the internet is one way that the Iran authorities use to prevent international intervention. 
“The power structure of the government, to a very great degree I think, doesn’t care about what human rights organizations say. So one of the tools that people use is to shut down the internet,” Movahedi-Lankarani said. 
Although nationwide protests continue, Movahedi-Lankarani reasoned that it would not bring a significant change to Iran’s political system. 
“In essence, I don’t think we are likely to see a wholesale change … more likely is that we might see a kind of quiet retreat from a setup enforcement of the kind of cultural, social, laws or issues,” Movahedi-Lankarani said.

USC’s undefeated season lives to see another week after defeating Arizona State 42-25 Saturday night. 
While he did throw his first interception of the season, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams rebounded from last week’s struggles against Oregon State. Williams threw for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns — adding 44 yards and a touchdown on the ground. 
“I thought he played well. I thought he saw the field well, made very few mental mistakes” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley.
In the first quarter, Williams escaped a collapsed pocket and scrambled to the right as he threw a dart across his body to sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams. It was the second time this season that the former Oklahoma teammates had connected for a touchdown.
“[Caleb] did a great job in some of the scramble situations, [he] again got us out of some trouble a couple of times” Riley said. “And I thought he really threw the ball well tonight.” 
Williams, who accounted for just 180 yards and was sacked twice last week, said that he focused on improving his mechanics in the backfield this week. 
“It always, normally, comes back to the basics,” Williams said. “So I went back to go back and I didn’t like the way some of my footwork throughout the last game was so I was trying to be more consistent with that.”
While USC’s offense put up plenty of points, it certainly looked off at times. Particularly, Williams was once again forced to use his feet to create plays because of a collapsed pocket. 
From tossing 300-pound linemen off of his back to avoid a sack or recovering a botched snap and scrambling for a first down, Williams’ athleticism was on full display — despite an offensive line that played “okay,’’ according to Riley.
“We missed a couple of blitzes, they had a couple of free runners on us,” Riley said. “[Arizona State is] a good front, we knew that coming in… It was a good challenge. They won a few, we won a few and then when they won, [Williams] did a good job of getting us out of it.” 
The defense was tested in the first half, allowing a Sun Devils team that has struggled this season to score on three of their four first half drives.
Redshirt junior quarterback Emory Jones proved to be a challenge for the Trojans. The Florida transfer finished the first half with 117 passing yards and both a passing and a rushing touchdown. 
Graduate student running back Xazavion Valladay found holes in the defense, running for 57 yards and a score in the first half. He added a 29-yard receiving touchdown, burning by senior linebacker Shane Lee on a cruise to the end zone. 
However, the defense began the second half with a newfound focus.  
On the first play of the second half, sophomore inside linebacker Eric Gentry, who transferred this fall from Arizona State, met Valladay at the line of scrimmage for a 1-yard loss. A few plays later, Gentry and Lee sacked Jones on second down. On the following play, Gentry once more came up with a tackle on third down to force Arizona State to punt. 
“That was a big drive in the game. [You think], how are we going to come out in the second half?” said defensive coordinator Alex Grinch. “It was good to see some energy and some life and some guys make some plays, and obviously Eric’s one of them.” 
Gentry finished the game with a team-high 6 total tackles, including 1.5 tackles for loss. He attributed some of the defensive miscues in the first half to the odd nature of playing his former team. 
“It felt weird playing against my own team, so we didn’t really have an edge,” Gentry said. “But in the second half, I felt way better. I felt way more confident — it’s another football game.” 
Redshirt senior running back Travis Dye also had a slow first half –— rushing for just 15 yards, but came alive in the second — rushing 13 times for 62 yards and 2 touchdowns.
The third quarter wasn’t all glitz and glamor for the Trojans, as Williams threw his first interception of the season. After finding junior wide receiver Jordan Addison for two long completions already on the drive, Williams lobbed the ball towards the end zone, where two Arizona State defenders were blanketing Addison. Redshirt fifth year Timarcus Davis came down with the interception, and the Coliseum was silenced. 
While an impressive streak was snapped, according to redshirt senior tight end Malcolm Epps, Williams wasn’t fazed. 
“Even when he threw the pick he was like ‘Alright, on to the next play,’” Epps said. 
The defense struggled with penalties in the second half but made up for their errors with 5 sacks in the second half and a game-icing interception from sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock, who could have taken it to the house if not for Jones’ determined pursuit.

Most professional soccer clubs preserve their uniqueness through decades and, occasionally, centuries. My favorite football club and current Premier League leaders, London’s Arsenal, adopted their uniform colors from local club Nottingham Forrest — and have sported the red and white combination ever since. In fact, the majority of successful and well-known soccer clubs have maintained their uniform and colors intrinsic to their milestones. Germany’s most successful professional club, Bayern Munich, has retained its signature red shorts and white shirts since its merger with Münchner Sport-Club in 1906. Italy’s most well-known club from Turin, Juventus, originally wore pink during its debut in 1900 before switching to their classical “bianconeri” or black and white stripes. 
However, similar to traditional corporations, soccer organizations encounter takeovers and experience occasional club changes. Following a financial takeover, investors Tan Sri Vincent Tan and Dato Chan Tien Ghee infamously changed Cardiff City’s uniform colors from blue to red to transform the struggling club in 2012. Clubs experience turbulent changes or drastic measures under new owners. However, acquisitions don’t necessarily always translate to net negative transformations.
Third-division British football outfit Forest Green Rovers recently transitioned from a black-and-white uniform to the mesmerizing and alternative black and green striped kit following Ecotricity founder Dale Vince’s takeover in 2010. Under Vince’s stewardship, Forest Green Rovers has become one of the most eco-friendly football clubs in the world amid their climb up England’s professional leagues. 
Complete Transformation
FIFA, the international soccer governing body, described Forest Green Rovers as “the greenest football club in the world” in 2017, following the club’s plethora of sustainable acts. From opting for electric vehicles to decrease carbon emissions to providing a 100% vegan menu during matches, Dale Vince’s Forest Green Rovers commits to its mission of benefiting the environment. 
There is substantial evidence that the Forest Green Rovers have remained consistent with their mission, as the United Nations assured that the club’s carbon footprint has dwindled by 42% since the 2011-2012 season. Interestingly, the U.N. report mentioned that fans started following the club’s virtues and implemented eco-friendly notions. 
Forest Green Rovers’ eco-friendly visions also seep onto the field. In 2011, Vince and the club started utilizing cow manure to create an organic pitch and installed solar panels around the stadium’s roof. The club recently announced its intentions to construct and move to new football grounds. The new “Eco Park” will harbor more green initiatives, including an exclusively wooden design, electric vehicle charging stations and 500 trees planted near the site to “promote biodiversity.” The innovative and unprecedented 5,000-seat project will continue cementing the club’s notoriously green identity and introduce eco-friendly initiatives to the mainstream. 
Unsurprisingly, Forest Green Rovers promote liberal and left-wing ideologies in conjunction with their green endeavors. Vince infamously flew a Palestinian flag at a match to announce the club’s siding with Palestine and shared anti-Israel sentiments. Vale also called for former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s help in providing aid to lower league football teams in England amid the coronavirus pandemic.  
Regardless, Vince, and by proxy, Forest Green Rovers, remain adamant and unapologetic over their green identity and uniqueness. However, that doesn’t translate to welcoming attention from the media and critics. 
Recent Criticism
Forest Green Rovers have been subject to scathing criticism from skeptics. Forest Green Rovers’ players were allegedly caught ordering fish, chicken and chips during their away trip to Macclesfield, despite the club promoting a vegan menu and lifestyle in home games. Additionally, owner Vince has been referred to as an anti-Zionist individual by Israeli media. 
There might be some criticism and objection to Vince’s drastic takeover of Forest Green Rovers. Although the acquisition presented net positive eco-friendly changes, some may argue that the club ceased to represent the community and began to reflect Vince’s personal ideals.
Whatever the case, Forest Green Rovers will continue to grab headlines for their pioneering front on sustainability as they look to reach the top of English football.
