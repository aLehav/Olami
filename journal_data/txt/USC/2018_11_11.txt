We’ve all seen this before. At least, I know I have: I saw two shooting scares at my high school and one here at USC. I remember watching the news and hearing about the tragedies at Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Pulse nightclub and the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas — the four deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. Every time, we mourned, we debated and we resolved that something like this would never happen again.
But it did happen again. On Nov. 7, a gunman entered a Thousand Oaks country music bar on college night and went on a shooting rampage, leaving 12 dead. 
I know I’ve gone over it — in a column last semester when the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. killed 17 students. It enraged young people like me to participate in a nation-wide #NeverAgain movement that called on our policymakers to address the issue of gun violence in America. I don’t know what more I can add to the conversation. Please don’t shoot people? Make sure to wear a bulletproof vest the next time you go to the grocery store? I’m tired. And so is the rest of America. 
But regardless of how mentally exhausting it is to discuss shooting after shooting, I cannot let this issue be swept under the rug or pushed out of the news cycle. The victims of Wednesday’s tragedy, and all Americans, deserve better than that. As people with basic human decency, we cannot ignore the ongoing wave of gun violence because it makes us uncomfortable or we’re grateful it hasn’t affected us yet. We also cannot ignore the fact that America has a gun problem — and it doesn’t look like we’ll find a solution anytime soon.
After a shooting like this, we usually attempt to backtrack and form an explanation as to what went wrong. More often than not, the focus turns toward the shooter. Male? Check. Veteran? Check. Mentally ill? Check. 
But generalizations — whether they are about ethnicity, gender or military status — are dangerous because not only do they unfairly label and place targets on certain groups, but they also oversimplify an issue that should apply to everyone. While there is something to be said in the fact that mass shooters tend to be men, the reality is that anyone can pick up a gun and pull the trigger. 
So instead of examining one person we should turn our attention toward the system that lets these shootings keep happening. We love to blame mental instability as the cause of mass shootings, but we never talk about the topic until after we’ve mourned. In my column about the Parkland shooting, I made the point that America should prioritize destigmatizing mental illness and developing emotional literacy at the elementary school level, which might help create a culture of awareness that prevents future violence.
A concept especially relevant to mental health as a whole, much of the discourse surrounding these tragedies boils down to transparency. That’s why, in these situations, looking for and talking about warning signs is so important: While we may never pin down exactly what goes through the mind of a mass shooter, we can search for signals that point toward a potential tragedy. But the “if you see something, say something” lesson doesn’t solely apply to mass violence — for instance, we should all stay informed about the signs of suicide or self-harm and report them if necessary. 
But if we truly want to create change, if we truly want to see more gun control legislation passed, then it is also our obligation to vote. Midterm elections passed, and California governor-elect Gavin Newsom has hinted at enforcing more gun control legislation in response to the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. In fact, House Democrats will make gun law reform a priority when the party takes control in January. Regardless of whether or not they will actually follow up on their promises, this is good news for the generation of young people who have grown up in fear of the chance that the next mass shooting would come to their hometown. After all, electing leaders who share our political visions is the first step toward making long-lasting progress. 
But for everyone’s sake, we cannot leave these issues in the hands of policymakers alone; we need to keep talking, keep fighting and keep marching. At this point, I’m not just tired — I’m exhausted. And while I may go to bed tonight in my usual state of worry, I just hope the fallen will rest in peace.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Drinking is more than a social norm on college campuses — many students consider it an integral aspect of their college experience. From Wednesday night to Saturday night, Fraternity Row and the University’s off-campus housing are teeming with parties, and alcoholic drinks are abundant. Popular Instagram pages like @imshmacked and @totalfratmove glorify belligerently drunk behavior and receive millions of likes and followers in return. 
College kids have a lot of fun, and that’s not a problem. But the line between fun and danger — between social drinking and alcohol abuse — is blurry. In fact, it is so blurry that a significant number of college students suffer from an alcohol use disorder. 
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reported that about 20 percent of college students, meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder, according to a 2008 study. More importantly, it is quite difficult for a college student with an alcohol use disorder to stand out from their peers, and, in turn, the condition goes untreated and often worsens. 
What distinguishes college students with an AUD from other alcoholics is that they are in a unique environment, one that consistently rewards heavy drinking, in the larger context of a society that is starting to understand binge-drinking behavior as a mental illness. They may dismiss their symptoms to comply with social norms or justify their dependence by arguing they are just doing what their friends are doing. A student suffering from an AUD may be influenced by college drinking culture to believe there is nothing wrong with their drinking habits.
AUD is characterized by compulsive alcohol use, loss of control over alcohol intake and a negative emotional state when not using alcohol. It almost always includes binge-drinking, which is defined as a pattern of consumption that brings blood alcohol levels to 0.08 grams per deciliter, the equivalent of about four drinks for women or five for men consumed in the span of two hours. To many college students, four or five drinks in two hours is just an average night out.
According to the NIAA’s national survey, almost 40 percent of college students have engaged in binge-drinking. AUD aside, one quarter of college students report academic consequences from drinking, from skipping classes and falling behind to receiving lower  grades. Binge drinkers were six times more likely than moderate drinkers to perform poorly on a test or project and five times more likely to skip class. 
The evidence is overwhelming that college students are drinking in unsafe, unsustainable amounts, and the college environment does not deter this behavior; in fact, it enables excessive alcohol consumption. When students get to college, they have an overload of unstructured time coupled with widespread availability of alcohol. With Greek life’s large social presence on many campuses, hazing becomes a problem — it is essentially built around the concept of how much alcohol one can handle. 
A scientific study conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that alcohol consumption is highest among students living in fraternities and sororities. Close to half of these residential members showed symptoms of an AUD by age 35. If college campuses are a breeding ground for alcoholism, Greek life is at its crux. 
College students experience an extreme level of freedom and pressure to drink. It is not hard to imagine how all these factors can quickly add up to an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. USC is no exception; it has set the example for partying in previous years: Playboy Magazine named USC as one of the top five party schools in the nation for two consecutive years (2012 and 2013), and Niche listed it as second in its 2019 edition of “Top Party Schools in California.” 
There is a frightening proportion of college students dependent on alcohol — right here at home and across the country. When they graduate and enter the working world, their alcohol problems will not disappear. They will be forced to confront their dependence; some will seek out treatment, and some will not. Some will get better, some never will.
There needs to be a greater emphasis on substance abuse prevention on college campuses, including USC. Although all incoming freshman are required to complete the AlcoholEdu course online, they do so before embarking on what is statistically the six weeks of heaviest drinking that they will experience in college. They answer the questions based on their pre-college selves and may not fully understand the risks that lie ahead. They may only recognize themselves in the AlcoholEdu scenarios after having lived through “Blackout Monday,” hazing or just the all-consuming pressures of trying to fit into college social life.
The University may not be responsible for its students’ decisions, but it does have a responsibility to keep students safe. The NIAA’s ongoing research on how to address the persistent and costly problem of student drinking shows that multilevel interventions are necessary to even crack the surface.
Individual-level interventions target students in higher-risk groups (such as first-year students, student athletes and members of Greek organizations) and use education programs, therapeutic approaches and behavioral interventions by health professionals. They are designed to change students’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to alcohol so they take fewer risks when drinking.
Environmental-level strategies target the student body as a whole and are designed to alter the culture of student drinking — namely, by reducing the availability of alcohol. Addressing this problem necessitates a careful and multifaceted approach, combining both individual and environmental interventions. Currently, the University is not doing enough. 
University Student Health services encourages those who believe they have a problem or who are struggling to reach out for help, but they fail to account for those who may not know that they have a problem. In some cases, a proactive approach at the right time may make the difference between a fun, harmless college experience and a lifetime of battling a debilitating dependence on alcohol.

Sophomore driver Jacob Mercep looks for the back of the net against UCLA. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team capped off its regular season on Saturday with a 12-11 victory against No. 2 UCLA, fending off a late comeback by the Bruins to secure a regular season record of 28-1. 
Coming into Saturday’s showdown, both teams were well aware that the outcome would determine the seeding of the upcoming Mountain Pacific Invitational tournament. A first-round bye was at stake for the two top-ranked opponents.
The clash began with missed opportunities for both teams. The Trojans peppered UCLA’s goal from the start, forcing redshirt junior goalie Alex Wolf to put up some early saves. After a quiet first few minutes, USC broke the silence with 2 goals.
Following the Trojans’ initial surge, the game turned into a shootout. UCLA answered each of USC’s scores to keep themselves within 1 goal at the end of the first frame, a trend that continued into the second period. Although USC achieved a 3-goal advantage UCLA freshman attacker Jake Cavano topped off a first-half hat trick to bring the Bruins within 2 at the half.
At halftime, the Trojans lead 8-6 and discussed adjustments to be made on both ends of the pool.
“We had to focus a lot more on defense, on who we want to shoot the ball,” senior driver Zach D’Sa said. “On offense, just putting away our shots. Their goalie wasn’t having a good day so we just had to put it away.”
While the first half was largely a contest between two aggressive offenses, the defensive efforts of both teams resulted in a scoring drought which lasted through the majority of the third quarter. Freshman goalie Nic Porter, who was nominated this past week for his third MPSF Newcomer of the Week honor, came up big for the Trojans with four saves in the quarter to keep the Bruins at bay. D’Sa awakened the Trojan offense late in the third with 2 goals to put USC up 10-6 entering the final frame.
“[Scoring those goals] was really good because both teams were starting to die a little bit, and I know I was pretty tired,” D’Sa said. “But it was good because it was 0-0 in that quarter, and the third quarter is the most important.”
While the Trojans held UCLA scoreless in the third quarter, the fourth was another story. Four consecutive goals from the Bruins brought the match to a tie with only two and a half minutes to go.
“They started making their shots,” D’Sa said about UCLA’s fourth quarter effort. “The guys that we didn’t want to shoot were shooting the ball and they were scoring. We definitely need to adjust that and focus more on the fourth quarter and not let them get back in the game.”
Junior driver Marin Dasic found the back of the net with 19 seconds remaining. A last second shot from UCLA looked as though it might tie things up again, but it instead hit the post, securing a 12-11 win for the Trojans.
The Trojans’ two graduating seniors, D’Sa and driver Daniel Leong, were honored prior to the game as part of the annual Senior Day Ceremony. Leong contributed an early assist for the Trojans, while D’Sa boasted a hat trick, including the  only 2 scores of the third period. Another standout for the Trojans was redshirt junior 2-meter Sam Slobodien, who led the Trojan offense with 4 goals. 
Remaining at No. 1 after defeating UCLA, USC has a first-round bye in this weekend’s MPSF tournament, automatically advancing to Saturday’s semifinal match. The Trojans aim to enter the NCAA Championships as the No. 1 seed.
“We need to get that No. 1 seed,” D’Sa said. “We haven’t been there in a long time, and No. 1 seed going into NCAAs is really important to us.”

Senior forward Hailey Hite celebrates with sophomore midfielder Arlie Jones following a goal on Friday. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Women of Troy shutout the Long Beach State 49ers 6-0 with six different goal scorers at home on Friday to advance to the second round of the NCAA College Cup.
“This is the kind of way you want to open postseason play,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I love the passion we played with, and it’s exactly what we need going forward.”
Following their loss to UCLA last weekend, the Trojans found out that they were given a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament on Monday.  However, they were ranked second-best in the country for most of the season.
“[The 6-0 win showed] that we’re really good,” McAlpine said. “We plan to show up at the next game and be really good again.”
At halftime, the Trojans comfortably led 2-0. Throughout the first half, the Trojans were in control of the game, having most of the possession and much of it in their offensive third. Moreover, the Trojans had 13 shots in the first half alone compared to the 49ers’ one shot from outside the box.
Redshirt junior forward Natalie Jacobs started the scoring in the first half when she headed the ball into the back of the net in the 20th minute. The goal came as a result of confusion within the box. From that goal on, the Trojans never looked back.
Five minutes later, sophomore box-to-box midfielder Alea Hyatt scored a left-footed volley into the upper lefthand corner of the goal from inside the box off an assist by sophomore box-to-box midfielder Tara McKeown. The finish took of skill and concentration, but Hyatt managed to keep calm to make the score 2-0.
The Trojans did not slow down in the second half, scoring 4 more goals in the second 45 minutes to easily claim an uncontested victory. 
“We’ve got bigger goals, we got big goals,” McAlpine said of the team’s aggressive second-half play despite its significant lead. “In order to reach them, we have to play and we have continue to push and play the way we want to play consistently for 90 minutes. Even though the score was 4 at 62 [minutes], we need to play for 90 and that was important.”
McKeown scored the opening goal of the second half after she was teed up for a wide open goal from Jacobs in the 53rd minute. Jacobs received a long ball down the left hand side from redshirt sophomore attacking midfielder Savannah DeMelo, and she took out down to the endline, beat a defender and crossed it to McKeown who had a wide open goal. Prior to crossing it to McKeown, it appeared that Jacobs was fouled in the box but never went down, and was still able to play McKeown with a great ball despite being fouled.
Senior forward Leah Pruitt was next to get her name on the score sheet as she scored from a one-footed finish to the far post of the goal. The goal came from a driving run forward by DeMelo who sent the ball onto the wing to Hyatt, who then crossed it over to Pruitt to finish and make it 4-0 in the 62nd minute.
One minute later, DeMelo was the fifth Trojan to score as she slotted the ball past the keeper from about 15 yards out. The goal was a team effort, as the Trojans connected a lot of passes prior to DeMelo scoring. Hyatt had a clear shot on goal from a tougher angle than DeMelo, but instead of attempting to shoot, she gave the ball up to her teammate who was at a better angle to finish off the movement. 
“She was in a much better position than I was and I knew that, so I gave it to her,” Hyatt said.
McAlpine said Friday’s game was one of Hyatt’s best performances. 
“[Hyatt] played free with a clear head and let it go,” McAlpine said. “That’s the kind of performance we need. And we allowed her to. We gave her touches, we gave her touches and we allowed her to get into the game early, and once that happens today, it looked good. ”
Senior forward Hailey Hite scored the sixth and final goal for the Trojans off of an assist from freshman defender Ashley Soto in the 80th minute of the game to cap off an impressive victory for the Women of Troy.
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, forward Penelope Hocking, left the field with an ankle injury. Her status for the next game has yet to be determined.
The Trojans will play the winner of Sunday’s LSU-Boston University game next Friday in their next round of the NCAA tournament. That game will take place at Florida State following the Seminoles’ 1-0 victory against Loyola Chicago on Friday. Florida State is the No. 1 seed in the Trojans’ side of the bracket.

All it took for the bubble to burst was one bad snap. 
On USC’s fourth play from scrimmage out of halftime, nursing a 14-0 lead, redshirt senior center Toa Lobendahn uncorked a snap over the head of freshman quarterback JT Daniels so far that it traveled 22 yards, rolling into the end zone for a safety. 
And then the floodgates opened. 
Following the bad snap, senior cornerback Isaiah Langley yelled at teammates on the sideline. On the ensuing Cal drive, freshman cornerback Olaijah Griffin mouthed off to the Cal offense before being beaten badly on a touchdown reception. An interception of Daniels and another Cal touchdown sealed a 15-14 win for the visitors on Saturday, but not before senior cornerback Iman Marshall committed an asinine unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in the fourth quarter that served as the nail in the coffin.
It was a comedy of errors, a procession of blunders that so aptly serves as a microcosm for this lost season — a season that lacks proper coaching, discipline and composure. And on Saturday for USC, the disappointment of no longer controlling its own destiny in the Pac-12 South deteriorated slowly into the realization that the best result the Trojans can garner out of the season is to make a bowl game. 
For comparison: Georgia State made a bowl game last season. So did Marshall, Colorado State and Western Kentucky. Also: Arkansas State, Middle Tennessee, Akron. USC is going to have to fight to reach the same goal that Middle Tennessee achieved last season. Nothing against Middle Tennessee, but the sheer number of things that have to go wrong for that statement to be true is large — extremely large.
That’s where we’re at: USC, sitting at 5-5, needing to beat either UCLA or Notre Dame just to save face and make a bowl. 
There are plenty of explanations for this. Blame it on starting a true freshman at quarterback or on the numerous injuries to pivotal players or even give credit to the opposition. As Helton said after the loss, sometimes a season just doesn’t go your way.
“Better days are to come,” he said. “Programs I’ve seen across the country, win a Rose Bowl, win a Pac-12 Championship and then have an off-season and then come right back.” 
That is true. But the one caveat is a big one: USC, even during a down season, still possesses as much talent as any of the top-tier teams in the country, and this team is definitely no exception. It keeps coming back to this point, the fact that — with this many four and five-star recruits on the roster — there is no way a .500 record is even close to acceptable.
All signs point to Helton surviving until at least the end of the season; Athletic Director Lynn Swann’s comments two weeks ago during Trojans Live seemed to make it apparent that he had confidence in the head coach. 
But to any observer, let alone Helton’s boss, Saturday’s letdown was pitiful. It is one thing to blow a comfortable lead, as USC has done several times this season. It is another to do so because of sheer incompetence — namely, attempting unnecessary trick plays, committing turnovers at inopportune times, not snapping the ball properly, burning timeouts and being flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct during crucial moments. 
It doesn’t help when the head coach defends the unsportsmanlike conduct calls by calling his players “sportsmen” and “first-class” players, or when he calls Lobendahn a “man of honor and great football player” in response to the center’s botched snap, or when Helton talks about how the next two games are great opportunities to win the Victory Bell and the Jeweled Shillelagh — two meaningless trophies to wrap up a meaningless season.
If the second half of this game — which saw USC produce 41 yards of offense for zero points on 31 plays — doesn’t convince Swann to make a coaching change, then nothing will. Last week, Helton’s first game since taking over playcalling duties was a success. But the Trojans faced Oregon State. Saturday, against actual competition, Helton’s offense looked like the status quo — that is, predictable, unimpressive and ineffective.
The fans think so, too. Boos rained down when Helton called a timeout before a fourth down play in the second half. They booed again when Helton walked through the tunnel after the loss, and “fire Helton” chants were audible from the crowd.
“It sucks,” senior linebacker Cam Smith said of the crowd’s reaction. “Can’t lose fans of our team, man.”
But that’s what has happened. USC has lost its fans. It is spiraling out of control in the wrong direction, and knowing the expectations, the hype that surrounds this team daily, the pressure to make a change sooner rather than later may be too much to ignore.

On “Simulation Theory,” Muse takes a creative detour into dance and synth pop of a different era. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Records)
Synth rock has never sounded so fresh. “Simulation Theory,” a space rock album that is theatrical, bizarre and completely unforgiving, wipes Muse’s palette clean and opens up new musical landscapes for the band.
The eighth studio album from the band features 11 distinct tracks. Some of Muse’s previous albums, such as “Drones” and “The 2nd Law,” could be considered concept albums, often centering around darker themes such as warfare and government oppression.
In contrast, “Simulation Theory” draws from science fiction and 1980s pop culture, focusing on the role of simulation and simulation hypothesis in society.
Muse wanted an era-traversing album that defied all expectations and standards of their previous music — from this, “Simulation Theory” was born. The band started recording the album in early 2017, and created songs in both London and Los Angeles with producers Rich Costey, Mike Elizondo, Shellback and Timbaland.
Despite centering on different themes and experimenting with its sound, Muse still gives listeners a multitude of familiar-sounding tracks. In songs like “Break it to Me” and “Blockades,” singer Matt Bellamy’s iconic mature tenor vocals match with synth and heavy bass lines. Though sweeter tracks like “Something Human” and “Propaganda” give the album a folkier edge, songs like “Thought Contagion” and “Blockades” capture the band’s signature bold, empowering brand of rock.
“Dig Down,”  one of the first songs written for the album, acts as Bellamy’s response to the political climate during the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum and the United States’ 2016 presidential election. Bellamy hopes the track can encourage people to have hope in a cause they believe in.
Visuals have played a huge role in the identity of “Simulation Theory.” It’s no surprise that “Stranger Things” artist Kyle Lambert designed the neon, eye-catching album art, encapsulating the 1980s aesthetic of the album. Muse also plans to release music videos for all 11 tracks, which Lance Drake will direct. The videos will each tell a distinct story, focusing on the theme of “digital containment and escape.” 
Although Muse took a different creative approach with “Simulation Theory,” most of the band’s popular elements are still present in every song on the album. Rather than giving the masses the same sound over and over again, Muse opted for “Simulation Theory”: a fresh, endearing and genuine showcase of the band’s present state. In this, Muse finds a way to provide listeners with a unique addition to its discography while maintaining the sound that made it one of this century’s great rock bands.

KiKi Layne and Stephan James star in “If Beale Street Could Talk,” a film that depicts the pregnancy of a young black woman and the flaws of the justice system. (Photo from IMDb)
When director Barry Jenkins sought to translate the pages of James Baldwin’s “If Beale Street Could Talk” into a feature film, his primary concern was fairly capturing the author’s voice. While Jenkins’ latest film is not as poetic or hypnotic as his Academy award-winning film “Moonlight,” his prowess as a director is showcased through the film’s beautiful presentation.
“If Beale Street Could Talk” is a love story between Clementine “Tish” Rivers (Kiki Layne) and Alonzo “Fonny” Hunt (Stephan James). When Fonny is sentenced to jail for a crime he did not commit, Tish must work tirelessly to prove his innocence before she bears their first child.
Whereas “Moonlight” segmented its plot into three distinct chapters, “If Beale Street Could Talk” follows a traditional narrative arc, weaving in and out of present day Memphis. In both time periods, Jenkins masterfully captures the setting,  with scenes ranging from Tish’s house to a lit street on a rainy night.
The film’s structure works well with the plot, but the story fails to flow. Understandably, “If Beale Street Could Talk” is intended as a slow drama, but some drawn-out scenes begin to lose their impact on the audience. 
Most of the story was narrated by one character, Tish. While this stylistic choice is unique for Jenkins, Layne delivers Tish’s lines jarringly, compared to the movie’s warm, slow tones. Jenkin’s  use of Tish’s narration makes it reminiscent to the eerie narration in “Goodfellas” — the film abruptly pauses to dead silence when Tish first narrates.
The acting is poignant, although there are a few moments when it felt overdone. In an early argument between the Rivers and Hunt families, the characters act more like caricatures than people. Aunjanue Ellis and Ebony Obsidian’s line deliveries and mannerisms are exaggerated to the point where their performances detract from the scene’s dramatic impact.
Additionally, many of the higher-profile stars like Diego Luna and Dave Franco feel out of place in their one or two scenes. They feel distracting, and drastically contrast with the world Jenkins set for Tish and Fonny. 
Had Jenkins not drawn so much attention to their recognizability, then they may not have felt so forced into the narrative. Actors like Luna and Franco are essentially extras and feel like they were put in to add some star power to the movie.
While these moments may be distracting, there are also parts where actors take full advantage of the scenario and truly shine with their dramatic range. Brian Tyree Henry’s performance as Daniel Carty has been heavily applauded, with some insisting that he receive awards attention despite appearing for only 12 minutes.
Once again, composer Nicholas Britell’s score is one of the year’s best. Even though there are some tracks that sound nearly identical, the score ranges from classical to jazz. These two styles attribute to the use of more instruments like piano, bass and horns, which produces different sounds across the tracks.
While some performances and moments are potent in conveying the movie’s themes, it’s the technical elements that are the most consistent in their greatness. Even then, the very few overly dramatic moments of acting and out-of-place stylistic choices suggest that Jenkins is competent. The best films seamlessly balance every aspect of filmmaking, and this movie wasn’t as refined and focused as “Moonlight,” in those regards.
If anything, Jenkins fills “If Beale Street Could Talk” with care and dedication to Baldwin’s original work and, in doing so, cements himself as one of the most talented up and coming directors working in the industry.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
When pop singer Ariana Grande released “thank u, next” earlier this month, she launched a new kind of breakup anthem into the world. “thank u, next” details Grande’s resolve to move on from past relationships — including Saturday Night Live cast member and ex-fiancé Pete Davidson. While I’m not a fan of most of the production choices behind “thank u, next,” the song achieves its mission lyrically — to empower women in the limelight to take control of their own breakup narratives. 
The breakup song is a staple in mainstream music. As long as there are songs celebrating new love, there will be popular tracks on the devastating end of it too. Yet, when a woman pens a song about a relationship running its course, listeners tend to read into it more. Songs like Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River” and The Weeknd’s “Call Out My Name” are directed at past relationships fans have successfully identified and should be read as such, but men can get away with writing these songs without the critical observation of every subsequent career move. 
Pressure from the public makes it difficult for female celebrities to escape from the exhausting weight of their past relationships. Take Taylor Swift’s ballad “Dear John,” which dissects the toxic relationship between Swift and singer-songwriter John Mayer, who is 13 years her senior. As the song progresses, it’s revealed that he becomes more controlling, and Swift is too afraid to speak up for herself in the relationship. When he leaves her, she realizes that she was only one in a long list of girls he has taken advantage of in the past.
 “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home,” Swift laments in the nearly seven minute song.
The track is both brutal and gorgeous — a true standout in her discography. It is also one of the first songs that come to mind when people argue that Swift’s entire career can be reduced to breakup songs that emasculate her partners. Since then, fans have scoured her lyrics for references to past relationships to an obsessive degree, and critics have called her out for being a one-trick pony of sorts. Some would argue she would not have had the same success if not for the songs she dedicated to her former boyfriends. 
Then there is Selena Gomez, a performer whose list of exes hasn’t been as extensive as Swift’s but has been subject to the same critical eye. The 2018 single “Back To You” sees Gomez reminiscing about the pitfalls of a relationship. Looking back on her relationship with a clearer head, she can see how problematic their love was. In the chorus, she admits that despite the trials they went through, if given the chance, she would start the relationship over again. 
Despite its placement on the “13 Reasons Why (Season 2)” soundtrack, from which it can be interpreted as a reflection of the relationships highlighted in the show rather than Gomez’s personal life, listeners couldn’t help but make connections between the song’s subject and her on-again, off-again ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The two rekindled their romance at the start of the year, only to call it off for good shortly after. Jelena shippers jumped at the nostalgia-driven lyrics, prematurely limiting their focus to the context of Selena and Justin’s relationship.
Not even Beyoncé, the queen of female empowerment, is safe from being defined by her past relationships. The entirety of “Lemonade” is a concept record about dealing with infidelity in a relationship and moving past it. While not a breakup album per se, many of the individual tracks can be deconstructed as such. Tracks like “Don’t Hurt Yourself” put the alleged cheater (Jay-Z) on blast with raging guitars and screaming vocals from Beyoncé. Slower cuts like “Sand Castles” show Beyoncé in her most vulnerable state, as she struggles to find the strength to forgive and move on from the broken trust in her relationship. It’s one of the more charged and empowering listens of the decade, dealing with themes of racial tension and cultural identity. 
Grande’s latest song may not change how women are viewed through the lens of their relationships, especially when she lists her former lovers by name. However, while most breakup songs are written from a place of lingering hurt, “thank u, next” looks back on Grande’s romantic trysts with a graceful smile. 
“One taught me love, one taught me patience, one taught me pain,” she sings.
What I find most remarkable is the second verse, where she reveals that she’s moved on from dwelling on the hardships of her relationships and is now working on self-love, instead of diving right into a new relationship. She carries the lessons she learned from her relationships to improve herself. It’s a smart move for the pop star — one that demonstrates maturity.
Grande may receive scrutiny for relationships down the road, but she’s paved the way for that to change going forward. Reframing “thank u, next” as a discovery of self-love was a brilliant move, one that can hopefully shift the language around creating and discussing breakup songs by women in the future.

Students attend a Homelessness Awareness Week event last year. The annual week features events aimed at educating students while finding solutions to homelessness. (Photo courtesy of Faizus Amin)
Undergraduate Student Government, Student Service Assembly and Share a Meal, among other organizations, are co-hosting the University’s annual Homelessness Awareness Week, which runs Nov. 12-15, to educate students on the prevalence of homelessness both on and off campus.
“We’re trying to balance awareness to action,” said Alec Vandenberg, director of external affairs for USG and president of Share a Meal. “Not only to get people educated, but also [to] give them concrete tools to make a difference now and in the future.”
The event starts Monday with a screening of “Invisible,” a documentary which depicts the struggles of low-income students, followed by a discussion with the film’s director, Justice Butler. 
Homelessness Awareness Week is focusing its efforts on campus hunger and homelessness, according to Vandenberg.
“When we take into account factors such as the rising cost of college and tuition coupled with consistently skyrocketing rent, we know that it becomes harder and harder to be a low-income student, especially on this campus at a private university,” Vandenberg said. 
On Tuesday, Swipe out Hunger, an organization that focuses on food insecurity and homelessness, will host a hunger banquet. Participants will be sorted into varying socioeconomic classes with the purpose of simulating the income disparity and consequences of homelessness in Los Angeles. 
The week continues on Wednesday with a volunteer and resource fair, which provides students with concrete ways they can help out the USC and South L.A. community. 
On Thursday, the Fast-A-Thon, during which students pledge to fast for the day, is intended to show students what it’s like to experience food insecurity. It also gives them an opportunity to sponsor a meal for the homeless through the Ansar Service Partnership.
The week ends with a public policy discussion titled “Getting Everyone in the Door,” where the Los Angeles Police Department, A Community of Friends and Abundant Housing representatives will discuss policy challenges toward ending homelessness. 
“We’re going to be inviting different public policy stakeholders from around L.A. to come and speak about their work and also the perspectives that they have on homelessness in L.A.,” said Mae Gates, who will moderate the panel. “We hope to take that discussion and relate it back to certain issues and things that we see here on USC’s campus.” 
Faizus Amin, the director of Campus Affairs for Student Service Assembly and moderator on the Swipe out Hunger panel, said engaging in Homelessness Awareness Week is an integral aspect of social responsibility in the South L.A. community.
“By having this week, we’re educating ourselves as students on what causes homelessness, what homeless life can be like for some people and how we can contribute to ending the cycle of homelessness, which is running rampant through Los Angeles,” Gates said. 
Vandenberg said participation during Homelessness Awareness Week is a vital way students can help their community on campus. 
“Sometimes we delude ourselves by thinking that because we’re at a private university and because we have such generous financial aid, that that somehow precludes us from having students [in] need who fall through a lot of those safety nets,” he said. 
According to Vandenberg, It’s important to spread education and awareness about the consequences of homelessness continually, not just throughout the course of Homelessness Awareness Week.
“We’re really trying to make sure that homelessness and addressing it is very interdisciplinary,” Vandenberg said. “Regardless of your background, everyone can and should make a difference.” 
Amin encouraged students to attend Homelessness Awareness Week events to learn about the nature of homelessness and to venture out beyond the USC community. 
“Through Hunger and Homelessness Week, we want students to realize that USC is definitely a bubble,” Amin said. “This is not the reality of South L.A. and we should do our part as a member of the South L.A. community and serve those around us.”

Volunteers pass empty milk jugs around the Coliseum on Saturday to raise money for a free summer camp for students from elementary schools near USC. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
Dozens of empty milk jugs found their way through the Coliseum audience at halftime during Saturday’s Homecoming football game, as student volunteers collected money from the crowd for Troy Camp’s annual fundraiser. 
The Pass the Can fundraiser has been a part of Troy Camp since the 1970s, making it one of the oldest traditions and largest fundraisers put on by the student organization. 
In order for the fundraiser to run smoothly, a large number of students volunteer each year. This year, approximately 1,200 students signed up to pass the jugs.
“[It] was a really incredible experience, just being on the field and looking all across the stadium and seeing the support of the USC community for Troy Camp,” said Troy Camp co-executive director Marla Ross. 
Each volunteer receives a “Pass the Can” T-shirt and free admission to the football game, as part of a partnership between Troy Camp and USC Athletics.
In the past two years, Troy Camp has also run an online campaign along with the halftime fundraiser. This year, the virtual campaign ran for three weeks before the Homecoming game, allowing Troy Camp to raise around $13,000.
“It was a decision we made with the executive board, alumni and general members throughout the year,” said Kyle Footitt, Troy Camp’s fundraising director. “Having cash is less common at games; virtual is going to be the route that most people go.” 
The donations raised from Pass the Can are used to fund a summer camp for students from local elementary schools. The camp is free for students and features activities such as archery, swimming and horseback riding. 
To spread the word about Pass the Can, Troy Camp advertised the event on campus and through social media to both increase donations and attract more volunteers. 
“We ask people to reach out to their friends, we ask them to present in classes, we send out email to our classes, we sit on Trousdale and table,” said Molly Bamberger, Troy Camp’s co-executive director. 
The final amount from this year, including the online campaign, is estimated to surpass 2017’s total of $27,000, but the final count wasn’t complete by the time of publication, according to Bamberger. 
“We do our part every year [to publicize Pass the Can], but there is such a deep-rooted tradition within the USC community and the surrounding community,”  Ross said. “We have Troy Camp alumni [volunteer] from several years in the past. I met one who was 12 to 15 years out and still comes every year.”

Associate professor Erick Guerrero filed a lawsuit against 72 professors from Dworak-Peck School of Social Work for libel on Oct. 26, following their public condemnation of Guerrero after he was accused of sexual harassment by a former student in October 2017. 
Nearly 70 faculty members actively supported Karissa Fenwick, an alumna who accused Guerrero of sexual misconduct, and signed a letter condemning USC’s actions after Fenwick’s allegations were made public. Guerrero’s lawsuit said that the statements in the letter were false and written with the intention of “malice, oppression and fraud.” Guerrero was placed on suspension by the school for the Fall 2018 semester, and is still listed on the faculty directory. 
“[Guerrero], who previously enjoyed a good reputation in the USC community and in the field of social work research, both personally and professionally, was defamed by [the professors’] assertions that [Guerrero] engaged in sexual misconduct and witness intimidation,” the lawsuit read.
The lawsuit also stated that Guerrero has suffered damages worth over $1 million and that the misconduct allegations have damaged his reputation at USC.
The University said it supports the faculty who are being sued by Guerrero and is providing them with legal counsel.
“USC protects the academic freedom of all faculty, of every track, including the freedom to disagree with the administration,” the University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Provost Quick has authorized providing the faculty members who were sued with outside legal counsel to defend them.” 
John Winer, Fenwick’s attorney, said he is not surprised by Guerrero’s decision to sue in response to the aftermath of the sexual misconduct allegations.
“A favorite strategy of men in powerful positions who get sued or accused of sexual harassment … is to immediately make threats,” he said. “This case has been investigated maybe five times and her allegations have been sustained every time. The University had every right to be able to rely on the results of an unbiased investigation and if something’s true, it cannot be defamation, period.”
The next hearing for the suit against the social work professors will be held at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse on Feb. 8. 
Along with the libel suit, Guerrero also filed a writ of mandamus against the University and various administrators, in an effort to have the California Superior Court review the actions USC took against him, which he claims were improper. A writ is an order from the court to an organization that orders it to fulfill its official duties or correct an abuse of discretion. 
In the writ of mandamus, Guerrero claimed that USC failed to complete a proper review of the allegations against him as required by the USC Faculty Handbook. 
“The entire case against Dr. Erick Guerrero is based on the personal opinion of OED investigator Donna Wagner regarding two USC female graduate students,” the writ alleged. “Over the past year, no one at USC has ever examined the merits or basis of Ms. Wagner’s opinion.”
Guerrero did not respond to requests for comment. His attorney, Mark Hathaway, said he cannot comment on pending litigations.
Alumna Robin Petering, who actively supported Fenwick when she initially filed a complaint against Guerrero, said she is frustrated by the recent lawsuit against the social work professors. 
In 2017, Petering co-founded Social Workers to End Rape Culture, which collectively penned a letter in support of Fenwick to the USC community, condemning University administrators for not committing to “a culture of safety, transparency and accountability” on campus. 
“It’s been a year since Karissa came forward publicly, and that was already 10 months after the original incident happened that she reported on,” Petering said. “So it’s frustrating to see how long this process is and that despite the fact that the University … during its own investigation, found him responsible multiple times through the appeals.” 
The writ of mandamus also claimed that disciplinary action against Guerrero was done with the intention of saving former President C. L. Max Nikias’ image after “a series of very public failures in leadership.”

The Helenes began a 24-hour watch Sunday to guard the Tommy Trojan and Hecuba statues in the week leading up to the USC vs. UCLA football game. The female service organization has taken on the duties of its brother organization Trojan Knights, which has been inactive this semester due to alleged reports of hazing and misconduct.
The Helenes declined to speak about the nature of the Knights’ inactivity, but Helenes President Alexa Huerta said that her organization was excited to have been given this opportunity.
“It’s so exciting,” Huerta said. “It’s a fun opportunity to camp out for a week. It’s like one giant sleepover with some good friends.” 
Trojan Knights President Dillon McKinley said he was unable to comment on the group’s inactivity, but in a statement to the Daily Trojan, McKinley wrote that the organization had strayed from its values. 
“We, as an organization, see a need to restructure and reorganize so that we can once again lift those values up properly,” the statement read. “We will be taking the next year to accomplish these goals and implement the necessary changes … With the current plan, we intend to continue into our centennial anniversary and beyond to show that we are dedicated to the future of this great University.”
During rivalry week, the all-male Trojan Knights have traditionally guarded the Tommy Trojan statue in Hahn Plaza from pranks and mischief from the University’s cross-town rivals. 
Since the Hecuba statue was erected in the USC Village in 2017, the Helenes have also taken part in the tradition. 
Helenes Hecuba watch chair Saman Hemani said that other organizations such as the Undergraduate Student Government, Troy Camp and the Admissions Center will be aiding the Helenes as they watch over Tommy Trojan.
“We’ve let all the Helenes know that we have twice as much responsibility,” Hemani said. “But we are also collaborating with a couple of other [organizations] … Hecuba will be Helenes only and Tommy will be ‘Helenes plus.’” 
Erica McCann, the Helenes advisor, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan that the organization has partnered closely with Campus Activities, DPS and other campus offices for Hecuba Watch. 
“This will be the first year the Helenes take lead on Tommy Watch, though they have always been actively involved in supporting the Knights’ efforts in years past,” McCann wrote. “They are well-prepared to take a leadership role over both watches this year, though it has been a lot to coordinate. I am very proud of how the Helenes executive board has stepped up to ensure these traditions are upheld.”
Hemani said that the Helenes and the Trojan Knights, which are brother-sister organizations that carry similar missions, typically work together on certain events, like Junior Helenes and Knights mentoring, but that the Knights have not been as involved this semester.
McCann said that though the Knights are inactive, the Helenes have aimed to preserve several traditions, including ringing the Victory Bell at football games. 
At the start of the semester, Huerta said she proposed the idea of the Helenes conducting Tommy Watch to Campus Activities.
“The tradition is really important to us,” Huerta said. “In that sense, it almost felt natural for us to say, ‘Hey, we are willing to do [Tommy] too.’”
During the Tommy and Hecuba Watch, the Helenes will be coordinating a hygiene drive for homeless individuals and partnering with Share a Meal to feed homeless people around USC. Last year, the Helenes received over 100 donations and hope that students will be more involved this year.
USC declined to comment on the Trojan Knights suspension. Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry also declined to comment.
The Daily Trojan also requested comment from multiple members of the Trojan Knights, who did not respond in time for publication.

The USC Shoah Foundation’s headquarters has moved to the fourth floor of Leavey Library and its Visitor’s Center is open to the public starting Monday. 
Featuring virtual reality theaters, interactive exhibits and innovative research spaces, the Shoah Foundation’s new home will allow it to share its visual history archive of over 55,000 testimonies from genocide survivors on campus. 
The foundation celebrated its 25th anniversary last week with the opening. Shoah Foundation founder Steven Spielberg and interim president Wanda Austin attended the ceremony.
The foundation was started by Spielberg in 1994 after he directed “Schindler’s List” the year prior, and moved to USC in 2005. Before moving to the top floor, the foundation was housed on the third floor of Leavey Library.
The new location provides spaces for recording testimonies from genocide survivors, technology for showing virtual reality films and interactive exhibits for visitors to explore the foundation’s work. 
“There’s lots of interactive screens, videos, ways to engage with the content, learn about what we do, search for family or other kinds of research,” said Aaron Zarrow, the Shoah Foundation strategic communications manager. 
In addition to the new features that allow the general public to view the archive, the new space includes offices and conference rooms for researchers. 
“Not only are they able to work in a space but … we’ve got a space for doing conferencing and meetings and seminars,” said Stephen Smith, the foundation’s executive director. “We can accomodate people on the side, which is terrific.” 
Integrating emerging technology into the new headquarters makes it possible to create a more visual experience to present their research to the public, Zarrow said.
“[The headquarters] has more than double the space and really upgrades a lot of the technology,” he said. “There’s some functionality that we have now that we didn’t have before,” he said. 
Smith said the new headquarters will allow the Shoah Foundation to access the public, both at USC and in the global community, and see the potential of their research expand. 
“While we’re more deeply embedded in the campus and the life of the campus, we’ve also got a greater facility to reach the globe with our work,” Smith said.
