I have a friend who is very good at masking her emotions with a smile. One day, we got drunk and she revealed a lot of hardship in life. When I followed up after some time, she pretended like nothing was wrong. I am worried about her, but I don’t want to press her too hard. What should I do?
You are a great friend for wanting to help. 
To be fair, your friend is probably going through a lot on her own. She is probably stressed out that she said something. She may feel uncomfortable that she told you when she was drunk. Or, she might not remember that she told you. Either way, I would be very specific with her. Tell her about what concerns you. Repeat back what she said to you. Say how you feel and how that makes you worried about her. Express that you are asking because you care. That’s important. If she knows you’re coming from a good and caring place, she’ll feel more inclined to talk to you. 
Also, give her space. Maybe she needs some time to clear her own head. If you want to be there for her, offer to go to quiet spaces with her. Offer to just grab coffee and listen. Be there and ask in what capacity she would like you to be there.
Lastly, if it’s really important and concerning, please do the following below:

Whether you’re a Donald Trump supporter or not, it’s hard to deny that the release of his Access Hollywood tape has been a defining moment in this election, causing irreversible damage to his campaign. Prominent Democrats and Republicans both have spoken out against his comments, describing them as the unacceptable language of sexual assault, subsequently undermining his credibility. 
On one hand, Trump supporters argue that his “locker-room talk” excuse is sufficient, and that the media and public seem to be condemning him unfairly for what is largely a normalized fixture in male-only conversations. Conversely, others claim that his dismissive apology is indicative of a more sinister rape culture and toxic masculinity that Trump’s character seems to embody, and that a man capable of making such comments is unfit for the presidency. 
Because of the nature of our predominantly liberal college campus, our conversations, whether in-person or on Facebook, will largely revolve around critiques of Trump’s comments and viewpoints, past and present. These conversations will most probably consist of denouncing and characterizing Trump voters as irrational, illogical, and misogynistic — not unlike Hillary Clinton’s controversial “basket of deplorables” statement. I, too, am certainly guilty of stereotyping Trump voters and jumping too quickly to conclusions about the issues that matter to them in this election. For this article, I decided to interview two USC students who are Trump supporters, one male, one female, about how they feel about Trump’s stance on women’s issues and their reactions to his comments on women. Both chose to remain anonymous. 
To be informed voters, our responsibilities go beyond enclosing ourselves in a political echo chamber, but to try and listen to perspectives that we may not agree with. This is my genuine attempt to try and understand why some of my fellow students at USC, both intelligent, both certainly believers in equal rights and opportunities for women, believe that a Trump presidency will be a beneficial one for our country. 
Interview with male USC student
What did you think about Trump’s recent interview comments about groping and kissing women without consent in the Access Hollywood tape?
I think he’s shooting himself in the foot with every step of the election and wondering why it’s getting harder to walk. The comments don’t particularly bother me because there’s plenty of other examples of talk like that in the media. To give an example, the “F*ck her right in the p*ssy” guy on the news became a viral sensation. I heard almost equal men and women laugh about it. Men talk and joke around, I hear phrases like that thrown around every day from both sexes, so it doesn’t bother me.
Did your opinion on Trump change after these comments were released, or did they remain constant?
No, they didn’t change.
Trump has defended his comments repeatedly saying that they were mere “locker-room talk.” Do you think that there is validity to this explanation? For example, have you witnessed similar conversations in closed, male-only spaces?
I think there’s complete validity in these statements. Yes, I’ve heard plenty of similar conversations in male-only spaces and I don’t think this should come by surprise. Think about the ‘male construction worker stereotype’, whistling when a pretty girl walks by; this isn’t exclusive to Trump, in fact, I would be willing to bet that the very men that condemn Trump for these statements have made similar remarks in the past.
If you were a woman, do you think you’d be affected by his past comments about women and the ones that were just released on the tape?
I’d like to think not, simply because I feel I would be rational enough to realize it’s private talk, it’s ‘locker-room talk’, etc. I don’t care if our president makes crude jokes, as long as they do their job then it doesn’t matter. I’d like to point out that I would be more disgusted that Bill Clinton would be allowed back into the White house after proven sexual assault and cheating on his wife. That bothers me substantially more than Trump’s ‘locker-room’ remarks.
How do you think his policies would affect women, if elected?
They won’t. I’ve had this conversation with many of my female friends, none have been able to point out a specific policy, proposed law, or proposed directive that directly affects women’s rights.
 
Interview with female USC student
How important are women’s issues to you in this political campaign?
I believe that women’s issues are important in general. In this campaign, women’s issues are important but the most important issues for me in this election are foreign policy, national security and the economy.
How would you describe the tone of this election, particularly on women’s issues?
I think that this election is progressive particularly on women’s issues, as we now have our first female nominee for the presidency. I think that the tone of this election is positive for women because we have our first female nominee. Whether I agree with Hillary Clinton’s political views or not, she has reached a great accomplishment by becoming the first female nominee of this country.
What did you think about Trump’s recent interview comments about groping and kissing women without consent in the Access Hollywood tape?
 I thought it was inappropriate and it definitely hurt his campaign.
Did your opinion on Trump change after these comments were released, or did they remain constant?
After these comments were released from eleven years ago, it definitely was disappointing, but it did not catch me by surprise. If you asked me before these comments were released if I thought Trump spoke like this, my answer would most probably be “yes.” If you ask me if I think a large portion of men speak like this in private my answer would be “yes” as well. Therefore, it was unfortunate that the American people had to hear the republican nominee use those words. However, it didn’t change the vital things in this election, like Trump’s strong stance on national security, his tax plan, or his foreign policy. It was unfortunate, but I had to refocus on the future of this nation instead of my feelings.
Trump has defended his comments repeatedly saying that it was “locker-room talk.” Do you think that this is a valid argument?
 The truth is that it was a private conversation, that’s how I would categorize it. Private conversations are to be kept private because as American citizens, we have a right to privacy. Whether he labels it as locker-room talk or not is irrelevant, because what matters is that he apologizes and admits that it was not appropriate.
As a female, did you feel affected by his past comments about women and the ones that were just released on the tape?
 Personally, I was not affected. I have built my character to be strong enough to stand up for myself and women because I know that provocative language is in society. We hear this kinds of provocative language all the time in songs and the truth is that people will talk like this. It is a matter of having enough confidence to condemn it, because it will not be easy to wipe this kind of language from society.
Do you think it is OK for a potential future president of the US to make such comments?
 I don’t think it is OK. However, he has apologized and I don’t believe he was planning to run for president eleven years ago. There definitely would be many things said that are not OK if the media found and released the private conversations of nominees from any party or even state officials.  It is just a matter of what gets leaked to the public.
How do you think his policies would affect women, if elected?
I think he would have many beneficial policies toward women. For example, his child care plan which he has created with his daughter Ivanka, will be extremely beneficial for working mothers. Also, there have been many women working on his campaign and in high level positions in his private business. I believe he would produce a cabinet that consists of a fair proportion of women who will work with Mr. Trump on plans which will benefit women.

Spectators cheered as several Department of Public Safety officers — as well as students and faculty members — broke out in dance to the “Cha-Cha Slide” and the “Cupid Shuffle” in front of Tommy Trojan. 
The dance, which was meant to represent unity between the student groups and staff, took place on Tuesday as part of #TogetherUSC, a campaign designed to promote diversity and raise awareness for the inclusion of different student groups on campus. The hour-long event was sponsored by the USC Division of Student Affairs Support and Advocacy.
The event began with a performance by the Troy Tones, one of the student a capella groups on campus, followed by a flash mob. Throughout the event, faculty and staff in the Support and Advocacy division of Student Affairs passed around candy and slips of paper with contact information for various resource centers on campus.
“We want students to know they’re not alone on this campus and that we’re here to provide support and resources,” said  Leslie Lemus, an advisor at Student Affairs, Support and Advocacy. “I think sometimes the challenge is that students are not aware of their resources. We have staff presence at this event so students know that we are here to support them.” 
In her opening remarks, Lynette Merriman, the assistant vice provost for Student Affairs, Support and Advocacy, urged students to reach out to their peers. 
“Everyone should be able to have the experience that they want have at USC,” Merriman said. “TogetherUSC is really about the Trojan family. If you’re concerned about someone, a friend, a classmate, a partner, a roommate or someone who’s in a club or organization with you, reach out to them and see how they’re doing. If you’re not sure about approaching them on your own, know that we’re here for you.”

Merriman also emphasized the importance of awareness for stereotypes or stigmas on campus in efforts to minimize and eventually eliminate them.
“TogetherUSC is also about bias,” Merriman said. “If you have witnessed or been subjected to a bias incident where you have been made to feel uncomfortable, let us know. We have to better educate the community and we can do this with your help.”
The event included live painting from Sarah Reyes, a junior majoring in public relations. Taking inspiration from the event, Reyes stood in front of Tommy Trojan at the beginning of the event with a blank canvas that she slowly transformed into a colorful painting, illustrating three different faces all intertwined with each other. The piece will be on display at the Office of Student Affairs.
“They asked me to do a piece that represented the event, and I was supposed to do it here to get the vibe of what was going on,” Reyes said. “There was a lot of dancing so I knew it had to be fluid with lots of lines going everywhere. The whole event is about inclusivity so I used three different races in the piece: Asian, white and black. Their hair is all interlacing and flowing outward in a happy rhythm.” 
Represented departments at #TogetherUSC included Asian Pacific American Student Services, Bias Assessment Response and Support Team, Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services, Disability Services and Programs, El Centro Chicano, LGBT Resource Center, Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, Student Support and Advocacy and Trojans Care 4 Trojans.

Ziru Ling | Daily TrojanScreen test · USG Senator Tiffany Lian spoke about her plan to implement date-rape drug screenings at the health center Tuesday.
Sen. Kate Oh announced the creation of a residential theme floor for Asian Pacific Islander Desi American students Tuesday night at the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, along with Senators delivering updates on other advocacy projects. 
Oh has been working with Residential Education and Asian Pacific American Student Services to establish the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Leadership Floor, a new residential theme floor in Birnkrant Residence Hall. 
The floor is intended to support students of Asian, Pacific Islander and South Asian, or Desi, descent. 
Oh said that she had originally considered establishing the APIDA Leadership Floor in Fluor Tower, to align with the Latino Floor and Somerville Place, the African American residential theme floor, both housed in Fluor.
“Initially, what I was thinking was to have the APIDA Floor also be in Fluor Tower just because I think there’s always an intersection of these identities, and it would be nice to create an identity of West area as a multicultural area that emphasizes identity development,” Oh said. “But at the same time, I want us to encourage identity development in all spaces.”
After speaking with Residential Education Director Emily Sandoval about the logistical challenges of Fluor, including its high cost and suite-style rooms, Oh decided that Birnkrant would be the best choice to maximize student enrollment. 
Birnkrant was also chosen because the honors college will be moving to the University Village next year, leaving the building without an identity, Oh said. 
Before Oh’s proposal, Sen. Sabrina Enriquez announced the upcoming creation of the Middle East North African South Asian Student Assembly, which will house six student organizations. These organizations are currently held under the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and the Black Student Assembly but felt that they needed a separate student assembly to focus on issues specific to MENASA cultures.
Following Enriquez’ proposal, Sen. Tiffany Lian called for the implementation of date-rape drug screening at the Engemann Student Health Center. Currently, students seeking date-rape drug testing must travel to hospitals off-campus, which can be a barrier for treatment, according to Lian. Making date-rape drug screening available at Engemann would allow for immediate testing.
“Right now, if a student suspects he or she has been roofied, they have no way of figuring out if that’s true,” Lian said. “There is no research within the health center to allow them to test for that. Some of them just want to know — it might not even be about pressing charges.”
Finally, Sen. Daniel Newman gave an update on his initiative to ban smoking at USC. As of last week, all four assemblies — USG, Graduate Student Government, Staff Assembly and Academic Senate — have declared themselves in favor of a smoke-free and tobacco-free campus, Newman said. 
“The administration has told us repeatedly that once these four bodies accept these measures, they’re going to take it very seriously,” Newman said. “Now it’s just up to administration to look at this, and also on our part to make sure that the administration gets to this, hopefully by next fall.”

When Americans turn out to vote for the next President of the United States on Nov. 8, their decision will be influenced by more than just the candidates’ platforms and personalities. They will also make choices affected by the power of money in today’s campaigns, which was the topic of an event hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Tuesday night at the Ground Zero Performance Café. 
“Can You Buy an Election? The Role and Impact of Money in Presidential Politics” was the fourth installment in the institute’s “Road to the White House” series. Panelists focused on answering the question of why money is important in politics and how it can determine the outcome of elections. 
The event was co-sponsored by the USC College Republicans, USC College Democrats and the Daily Trojan. The four panelists featured in the conversation included Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel, Fundraising Consultant Tracy Austin, Loyola Law School Professor Jessica Levinson and ABC7 reporter Elex Michaelson. The discussion was moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Julia Poe, features editor at the Daily Trojan.
Levinson noted that although older voters currently receive information from traditional media such as television, the rise of social media and other innovations may, with time, decrease money’s prominence in politics.
“I think it’s going to get less important … because many [young people] use free media, and because if [millennials] decide to show up to vote, you are now the biggest percentage of the electorate, and you can swing potentially every election,” Levinson said. “You could really crater the influence of money.”
Michaelson spoke further about the power of social media to mobilize young people and provide name recognition for candidates who may struggle with fundraising.
“As a member of the media, I think they did a bad job ignoring [Bernie Sanders’s] campaign for a long time, but he was able to harness social media and go around the whole system,” Michaelson said. “He raised money through small donors in an unprecedented way … thanks to a grassroots movement that we’ve never seen before. And the people who don’t check the mail or [use traditional media] all paid attention to Bernie online.”
The panel also considered possible reasons for high voter apathy among young people, which Steel said resulted from a lack of information. 
“There’s a good reason why young people don’t vote — they don’t know enough,” Steel said. “They haven’t had experiences. They haven’t been integrated into the world of political information, and for many of them, it’s something they’re not willing to grasp.”
Maddi Eckert, a junior majoring in political science who attended the event, disagreed with Steel’s explanation for the low turnout among millennials.
“I think it’s very closed-minded and uneducated to say that an entire demographic block is uneducated … because this is a major generalization, and it’s a lack of understanding of where we’re coming from,” Eckert said. “While we don’t necessarily watch traditional news outlets, I think I might have access to as much information, if not more, on a daily basis [as older voters], and I know, for me personally, I definitely have greater diversity in the information I digest as well.”
The final two events in the “Road to the White House” series take place on Nov. 1 and Nov. 8, which is Election Day. Next week’s discussion, which will again be held at Ground Zero, focuses on what to look for as the polls come in, while the event on Nov. 8 is an opportunity for students to watch the polls come in live at Wallis Annenberg Hall.

The folk-rock band pushed boundaries on this album. Straying from safe acoustic guitar tracks, the band experiments with pop influences, trading “jangling guitars for swampy keyboards.” However, their essence remains the same. The folk influence and guitar mastery are recognizable, and Goldsmith’s signature vocals tie this album back to previous ones. 
“We want each record to have an identity, within the defined identity of who we are, and we want each record to have a referential relationship with what came before it,” Goldsmith said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We want to grow up, but not away from ourselves. We don’t want to abandon who we are, because we like who we are. But we want to refine, and add to it.” 
Despite its name, the album is upbeat, leaving listeners with a sense of positivity about their own futility. Rather than hopelessness, Dawes attempts to encourage fans to live their life to the fullest, 
“I have songs that revel in the sadness of something, or the darker side of something. And I don’t like singing those songs,” said lead-singer Taylor Goldsmith. “When I found Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan or Warren Zevon, they would take these situations, some sort of absurd, unfortunate reality and they would figure out a way to portray in a way that would give you hope or made you smile. Maybe this isn’t as bad as it initially felt. That’s what I want to sing about.” 
Unlike most rock bands, Dawes is secure in their desire to evolve with every album. They unapologetically change their sounds and inspirations and hope that their fans stay loyal and support them in their explorations. 
“I get on board with an artist, and I want to hear them push boundaries,” Goldsmith said. “I want to hear them get bored with something and get excited by something else. Challenge themselves and therefore challenge me. So, that’s the kind of fan that we play to.”
Having been in the business for several years — their first album North Hills was released in 2009 — Dawes has had to understand and maintain what motivates them as a band, and has successfully done so. 
“[Making this record] reminded me of when we made our first record,” Goldsmith said. “Of us continuing to push our circumstances in a way that excited us. I think if we ever lost sight of that, we’d lose our sense of inspiration and really disappoint ourselves. We don’t think about what came before, we always think about what comes next.”
Unlike most other L.A. success stories, members of Dawes didn’t set out to pursue music as a career.
“We thought four white guys from L.A. playing acoustic guitar songs was not really going to have legs,” Goldsmith said. “When we made our first record, the feeling was ‘Let’s get this record made, so it’s something we can show our friends once we inevitably have to go to our regular jobs. None of us ever saw it as ‘our chance.’”
Dawes has toured with Alabama Shakes, Mumford and Sons and Hozier, establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the folk music genre. They’ve sold out several venues across the country, and played several festivals, including Lollapalooza Berlin, South by South West and Bonnaroo. 
“Mumford invited us all on stage, members from War on Drugs, my Morning Jacket, and Shakes and Hozier, and we all performed “With A Little Help From My Friends,” Goldsmith said of Lollapalooza. “There were 70,000 people watching and not being able to see anything but humans for as far as you can see was a surreal experience.”
While they didn’t anticipate the kind of response and success they have achieved, the band has worked incredibly hard to get to where they are. 
“Just being the most talented guy in the room doesn’t make sure you’re the one that gets to do what you want with your life,” Goldsmith said. “Be obsessed. Be obnoxiously obsessed with what you do. Because, those are the only people who even have a chance of getting to do this for a living.”

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanHealing words · “Slammin’ Down the Stigma” was co-hosted by the Health Sciences Education Program and the Academic Culture Assembly. Alex Luu (above), president of Slam SCene, performed a poem about his father.
Tuesday night the Trojan Campus Center Grand Ballroom was buzzing with activity and excitement with the advent of the fourth annual Slammin’ Down the Stigma Poetry Slam. The poetry slam, hosted by the USC Health Sciences Program, focuses on creating a conversation on mental illness and health on campus. 
It is estimated that about 11 percent of college students suffer from anxiety and 10 percent  from depression. Additionally, 64 percent of students who take a break from college due to a mental illness never end up returning. These numbers show the importance of removing the stigma from mental illness and having open discussions about it. 
The event featured nine student performers whose pieces covered a variety of topics such as battling with depression, anxiety and other phobias as well as domestic abuse, self-acceptance and anger management. A professional freestyle poetry group and a headline performer concluded the show. 
The first performer, Jay Dent, known as Jay-So-Jay on stage, performed “The Sickness.” In her poem she spoke about her anxiety and the importance of getting treatment for mental illnesses. 
“You say ‘hi’ to your friends while someone is wishing they had friends,” she said, showing the audience her personal experience with anxiety. 
Alex Luu, the president of Slam SCene, a spoken word poetry club on campus, was another performer. His moving performance brought to light his father’s experiences in Vietnam and how they caused problems during his childhood and his relationship with his father. 
“My father tells me to punch him back, to validate my emotions with this next blow. ‘Son, go ahead, hit me,” he said, highlighting his father’s struggle with dealing with Luu’s emotions. “I knew very little of his past and so much of his presence.” 
Mahima Shah Verma, a junior majoring in history, recited “Spokesperson,” a poem about her eating disorder and the journey of self-forgiveness she has gone through over the past eight years. 
“When you talk about mental health and stigma, people misinterpret it. But it is not a stigma when your hear people around you going through the same things,” she said. 
Verma also stressed the importance of artistic expression for everyone, not just those suffering from a mental illness. 
“Everyone has so much stress they’re going through everyday, it’s completely normal to go though,” Verma said. “People need a place to share personal experiences.” 
The headlining act for the program was 17-year-old Mila Cuda, a poet, activist and photographer. She won second place at the National Book Festival’s Poetry Slam at the Library of Congress last year. 
At the event, Cuda performed different poems that focused on her father’s battle with depression, the romanticization of mental illness in today’s society, her relationship anxiety, the problems with the American college system and even a poem told from the point of view of Van Gogh’s ear. 
In her poem “Spilled Milk,” she highlighted the importance of ending the romanticization of mental illness, stating that, “I am not a problem, you do not need to fix me. Love me with my sickness, not because of it.” 
“The Price We Pay,” Cuda’s poem about the American college system, discusses issues of which most college students are painfully aware. 
“Slammin’ Down the Stigma” is part of the Academic Culture Assembly’s programming series for this year’s Mental Health Awareness Month, which focuses  on self-help and self-care. 
More events, such as lectures and a resource fair, will occur throughout the remainder of October. 
—-When you talk about mental health and stigma …
You are catering to people who say there is a stigma. You are adding to their prejudice.

Photo from A24Three phases · Told in three chapters, Moonlight tells the story of a black man struggling with his sexuality and identity while growing up in Miami. The film has been unanimously acclaimed by critics since its premiere.
Asking the Hollywood powers for diverse representation in film is like your mom asking you to clean up your room when you’re a child. You know you should do it, but you don’t. When you finally clean up, it’s only until the last minute, like when your mom is throwing a dinner party and expecting a group of 20 “any minute now.” 
In this case, I consider people who watch films — the diverse group of people that they are — as the collective “mom” in this situation. The “Hollywood powers” are, of course, the child, because it’s taken this long and this much begging to get the dirty laundry off the floor in order for a film like Moonlight to make its way onto the silver screen. And my gosh, it’s about time.
Moonlight premiered in New York and Los Angeles last week. However, it will premiere nationwide on Nov. 4 — a method used to generate and capitalize on buzz from New York and Los Angeles before releasing out into the proverbial wild. I had the chance to see Moonlight (and the Q&A that followed) at the Arclight Cinema Dome. It’s important to note that it was in the Dome — a screening room reserved for only the most blockbuster-y of films — because when I first bought my tickets, it was in a smaller theater in the adjacent building.
That was the more appropriate choice for the size and scale of the movie, considering it was an independent feature with almost zero recognizable names in the cast. But after the small showing sold out, I received an email from Arclight telling me they’d moved it to the dome because of an overwhelming demand. Let us not take that fact for granted, because when the screening day arrived, almost every seat in that massive 800-person theater was filled.
Directed by Barry Jenkins with a script adapted from the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarrell Alvin McCraney, Moonlight is a coming-of-age film about a young boy named Chiron who’s coming to terms with his sexuality while growing up in a rough neighborhood in Miami. Told in three acts (played by three different actors) we watch Chiron age before our very eyes as he struggles to define himself among school bullies, a drug-addicted mother and a culture which disapproves of
same-sex attraction. 
So many scenes are rife with uncertainty — an uncertainty that plays as much within the characters as it does within the audience. As Chiron progresses through life, we feel how achingly at sea he feels through every step of his journey. The film is beautiful, understated, nuanced and roving. “Dream-like” is a word used often to describe it, but that word almost undermines the bold reality we are faced with: This is the story of a black gay man. But it’s also so much more than that.
In the Q&A that followed, a man stood up in the audience and told the panel that Moonlight did for him what no other movie has ever been able to do: depict a young gay man of color’s personal journey with his identity. This type of representation, he felt, he had never seen before.
When I was 9 years old, my mother moved our two-unit family from bright, loud Los Angeles to the quiet, remote countryside in Oregon. I felt removed, both literally and emotionally, and sought refuge in movies for entertainment, for excitement, for wisdom and strength. When you’re that young, you look to anything for guidance and clarity for what the future might hold. At that age, I stacked my hopes and dreams on whether Anne Hathaway would prove her worth in The Devil Wears Prada, whether Sandra Bullock could catch the bad guy and win over the Miss United States judges or whether Elle Woods would ultimately succeed at Harvard Law in Legally Blonde.
If they could do it — or, perhaps more importantly — if she, could do it, then I felt like maybe so could I. I had representation in film — there were girls that looked like me, at least enough, so that I could identify with them, believe in them, root for them, and by extension, root for myself. Movies, in no uncertain terms, saved me.
I hadn’t realized — despite writing this column for almost two years now — just how acutely important representation was until that man stood up in the audience and said what seeing Moonlight meant to him. He had grown up and he was without seeing himself on the screen or in the media that was being offered to him and he was without the chance to find answers about life. 
And that is worse than my own botched metaphor about moms and messy rooms, because the characteristics at stake — personal identity, confidence, strength and self-acceptance — are what we build our lives on.
I am both relieved and excited that a film like Moonlight exists today. While it may be a belated first, it definitely will not and should not be the last.

Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanThe dunk tank? · The men’s basketball team opens their season on Nov. 11 against Montana and the student section will have a new name. The athletic department is taking student suggestions for the new name.
In early November, USC students will have the chance to make a decision of monumental importance. We live in a land of great opportunity, with unprecedented access to resources. Yet, we have fallen short of reaching our full potential. We must now choose a representative, symbolizing our highest ideals and capable of bringing us together. The decision will leave a permanent legacy for this land for generations to come.
Astonishingly, though, for such an important decision, we haven’t even been given a single viable option. Therefore, for anyone who cares about the future of this place we call home, we cannot settle for these non-options. We must follow our conscious and write-in the candidate we think would be the best option. 
I’m talking, of course, about the athletic department’s campaign to rename the student section of the Galen Center. 
I normally delete most of the mass emails USC sends out to students. But the athletic department’s “Basketball is back!” message on Sunday caught my eye. With basketball season around the corner, and the USC men’s team coming off a breakout regular season but abrupt end to March Madness, I was excited to see what the athletic department had in store to generate more fan interest on the court. 
They couldn’t have thought of a better promo. 
Crowd-sourced naming campaigns are maybe my favorite things ever on the Internet. For example, the United Kingdom’s environmental research council solicited suggestions for the name of a new ship and the name that garnered the most support was “Boaty McBoatface,” or the petition on change.org, directed at none other than President Barack Obama, to officially change the zoological classification of fire ants to “spicy boys.” It has more than 80,000 online signatures.        
So in light of this wonderful opportunity the athletic department has given this current class of USC students, I want to ensure that we take this responsibility seriously. I wanted to dedicate this column to discussing a list of potential choices before the poll for suggestions closes next week. But before throwing out some options, I want to make some suggestions for the process. 
The name should signify an actual place. We’re picking a name for the area, not a new name for us fans who congregate in it. The name should be no more than three words—it will have staying power only if it rolls off the tongue.
And most importantly, if the name is not original or unique to USC, then there’s no point in picking one in the first place. So let’s not even bother with including “The Pit,” “The Cage,” “The Zoo,” or anything vague like that on the list. Alliterations with “USC,” “’SC,” or “Trojan” are encouraged but not necessary. Lastly, anyone who suggests “The Den” must forfeit his or her football season tickets, as UCLA has already claimed that for their student section in Pauley Pavilion.
With that covered, here are some ideas, in no particular order:
–The Trojan Horse. Your history major friend will probably point out that the Trojan Horse actually symbolizes the Trojans’ shortsightedness and ultimate defeat to the Greeks in the Trojan War — and is part of Donald Trump’s rhetoric regarding the Syrian refugee crisis. But given that the athletic department’s objective with this whole campaign would be to get more Greek students into the building in order to overwhelm our enemies, it’s actually perfectly fitting. I’m all about self-deprecating irony.   
–The En-Zone. This is putting a lot of faith into our current head coach Andy Enfield. Usually this kind of honor comes posthumously. He hasn’t quite achieved the level of success as, say, a Mike Krzyzewski, the namesake behind Duke’s Kryzewskiville — where students often camp out before home games against rival UNC. Enfield’s shelf life may or may not be shorter than our next president’s, but hey, there’s nothing wrong with a heavy dose of optimism for the program’s near future. 
–The Dunk Tank. Sticking with reverence to Enfield and his high-flying style of offense, nothing would better solidify Los Angeles’ title of “Dunk City” than equipping the student section with an actual dunk tank, into which Tommy Trojan would plunge after any posterizing alley-oop or slam. It works much better than “The Splash Zone” because we don’t shoot that many 3s, and the next generation of students won’t appreciate the reference to Sea World’s now defunct Shamu show.   
–Lil Coli. If we’re trying to capture the gameday atmosphere on weeknight basketball games, we might as well try to play off the football culture. Your history major friend would also probably point out that the Coliseum is really a remnant of the Roman, (not Trojan) Empire, and sounds a little diminutive to symbolize an ancient amphitheater of martyrdom, but whatever. His history degree still isn’t employable. 
–The Flank. The section name should be a call to arms for all Trojan fans, and I’m sure the Trojan Army busted out the tactic all the time. It’s got a nice ring to it, too. 
–The Trench. This also really gets the warfare symbolism, but has the full alliteration with “Trojan” and could even be extended to “The Trojan Trench.” 
–The Trap. Not only does this have the full Trojan alliteration, but it also brings back memories Admiral Ackbar’s famous declaration during the Rebel victory in the Battle for Endor, which fans could all collectively yell any time our defense goes into a full-court press. 
–The 9-Oh Zone. I haven’t ran the idea past Big Sean yet, but work in some drink deals for fans in attendance and you’ve got the greatest corporate partnership to ever come out of Marshall. 
–Spicy-Boy Central. Just throwing it out there. At least there’s the ‘SC alliteration? 
I haven’t decided which of these ideas I plan on submitting — feedback appreciated, as always — but I feel like any one of these could catch on. The athletic department is closing the suggestion portal on Nov. 2, and then will narrow down the ballot for a school-wide vote. 
Many donors sacrificed millions of dollars for our right to freely attend basketball games at the Galen Center. It’s a shame only about 50 percent of seats eligible for students are filled up on a given night. All that’s stopping us from becoming a basketball school are these arbitrary notions that we can tailgate for football, but we can’t get rowdy for basketball. 
So do your part, Trojan students. Let’s bridge this divide, and find a name that can bring us all together on the court. Let’s make the Galen Center great again.

N-O on these….
The Flank
The Trench
The Trap
I can already hear our opponents/Btech renaming them to….
The Stank
The Stench
The Crap
I vote as “The En Zone”!

With a Thursday night game against Cal approaching quickly, head coach Clay Helton addressed the most pressing issues ahead of the game. Senior running back Justin Davis is listed as doubtful and did not participate in practice on Tuesday.
“Right now we’re pretty healthy with the exception of Justin,” Helton said. “Maybe we’ll have him back next week.”
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Ajene Harris and senior defensive back Leon McQuay III are both ready to compete in the game said Helton. 
Taking it home
Helton said that one of the primary focuses of Tuesday’s practice was red zone offense, something that he said would be the most important aspect of the game.
“Any time you’re playing a team that scores 43 points, you better be scoring points of your own,” Helton said. “In this game I don’t think field goals are going to be good enough.”
Helton emphasized that the offense worked on not only the first and second down options for the red zone, but the third and fourth down game plans as well.
The red zone was also a focus for the defense with Helton saying that he wanted the defense to “bend, but not break” and keep the Golden Bear offense settling for field goals and not scoring touchdowns.
The defense has been preparing for an up-tempo Cal offense and wants to be able to match them.
Thursday night football
Since the football game is being held on a Thursday that is a school day, there will not be tailgating allowed on campus. The restriction for tailgating also extends to the Row. There are off-campus tailgates being held at the Coliseum, Exposition Park and at the Galen Center.
From 4 p.m.-7:30 p.m., there is a student-only tailgate at Jesse A. Brewer Park. The event is being hosted by the Undergraduate Student Government and is free.

Photo courtesy of Sports InformationEnding with a bang · The Women of Troy finished their fall season with three players competing in the Pac-12 Preview. Sophomore Robynn Ree won the individual title by two strokes with a score of -6.
At the Nanea Pac-12 Preview in Kona, Hawaii, the Trojans played with a depleted staff of only sophomore Robynn Ree, freshman Allisen Corpuz and senior Elizabeth Doty, yet came out victorious. Ree took home the individual title at the Preview. The three Trojans competed as individuals and not as a team because of their missing players. Seniors Victoria Morgan, Gabriella Then, Tiffany Chan and Karen Chung were away at the LPGA’s Q school. Chan and Chung advanced to the third and final round. The Pac-12 Preview is the final tournament of the fall season. 
Ree was looking for her second collegiate win. Six holes into the final round, Ree was in second place at -3 overall, Corpuz fell to tied for 19th and Doty stayed tied for 43rd. With 10 holes to go, Ree tied for first again with a birdie. Five holes later Ree would have pars on 4 and 5 and a birdie on 3, ahead by 2 at -5.

LySandra Vuong | Daily Trojan
“Such a nasty woman.” 
He shook his head as he said it, smirking, his right index finger held up like a boy genius about to shriek “Eureka!” No doubt he thought his remark was fresh, even witty. Even so, perhaps the most disconcerting part of this incident was his smile, which he leveled directly at the camera. His opponent, unfazed or at least used to it, continued talking without hesitation.
Unlike Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, when the viewers of the third presidential debate heard Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s comment, they did not move on unflinchingly into the meat of the 90-minute spectacle. Instead, the Twitter backlash was instantaneous: what a misogynist, what a fool. And moreover, “nasty” — so what? Thank you, Trump, for making “nasty” a rallying cry. If nasty is what it takes to become the first female president of the United States, to reconcile power and authority with a woman’s body, then nasty is what the country is going to get.
The next day, Rep. Brian Babin — a far-off voice yelping from a corner of the media world — gave his two cents from behind a Fox News Radio microphone: “I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she’s being nasty.” But honestly, is there a lady anywhere, by this point, who is listening?
Much like the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 didn’t herald the age of a post-racial America, the election of Clinton this November will not signal the end of this country’s rampant, systemic sexism. Nevertheless, if there is any sign at all that things are headed in the right direction, then one need only look to the response to “nasty woman” as a litmus test.
It is a challenge all women (no matter how powerful) are familiar with: how far can they assert themselves before being deemed unlikeable? The answer is, honestly, not very much. Though it has been 70 years since women rushed into the workforce and almost a century since they were given the vote, it is absolutely no secret how men still want women to behave: submissive, quiet and afraid of the status quo.
Anyone who argues that this is not true need only familiarize himself with the widely recognized phenomenon of “mansplaining” (in which a man explains to a woman, often by interrupting her, a concept she already knows or can very well figure out for herself) or, perhaps this proven statistic that male executives are lauded for being outspoken, while female executives are criticized for possessing exactly that same quality.
One of Clinton’s biggest criticisms is her cold nature, her sometimes too-calculated responses and her over-preparedness — all of which can translate into her being “unlikeable.” Maybe even “nasty,” because she’s a woman who isn’t afraid to rhetorically demolish a man in the final ring of fire before the presidency.
But the reaction toward Trump’s “nasty woman” comment is almost as revolutionary as Clinton is.
She may not act “likeable,” but she made it here. For the first time, girls everywhere get to ponder: Does being likeable even matter anymore? On a national stage, Trump called Clinton “nasty,” and nasty women everywhere laughed him into the dust.
It is important to consider, also, who Trump was speaking to the night of the presidential debate. To recall, he looked straight into the camera as he uttered “nasty woman,” shaking his head and smiling. Clearly, he thought that his intended audience was out there, probably white, probably male. They exist, he thinks, somewhere over a sea of Clinton supporters, sharing the feeling that yes, this woman is nasty, that Trump is the one to sympathize with for being forced to listen to a woman squawk about debt and entitlements in his left ear. Clearly, the man Trump is sharing his smile with must be out there — the invisible bro on the receiving end of Trump’s imaginary fist bump.
But if Trump imagined that the majority of debate viewers shared his sentiment about Clinton’s nastiness, then he is wrong. After the debate, he would be hard-pressed to find anyone who would defend his degrading remark (save for Babin, of course). What people realize (that Trump didn’t) is what desperation sounds like. And Trump’s “nasty woman” phrase stands out not only for its inherent sexism and profound lack of diplomacy, but also because it reeks of the longing for approval.
The American patriarchy is constructed from men patting each other on the back, and there was no one patting Trump’s back that day, on stage or after the debate finished. It was obvious to anyone watching that the “nasty woman” comment was Trump’s last futile attempt to paint as unlikeable a woman who the public has already accepted as such. Truthfully, the comment resembled the whimpers a child would give as he drags himself to the time-out corner, the punishment and the outcome of his bad behavior already dealt.
Again, electing Clinton to the presidency will by no means mark the end of sexism. But what it will do is signal the biggest kick to the tower,  resulting in the tumbling of the patriarchy. And if there’s any moment from her campaign the public should remember, it must be this one: Almost 100 years after women were granted the right to vote, a woman has navigated herself all the way up to the presidency. And that she can stand, on the stage of her third and final presidential debate, across from a man who can call her “nasty,” and that for once, in all of history, this will demonstrate more about his character than it will about her own. 
People of all colors and genders come in all packages – good and bad. That means for every “group” whether we are looking at race or gender we will have hard working, lazy, generous, greedy, kind and nasty. Yet, in recent years it has become taboo to describe certain groups with certain descriptions – even if it is accurate – because the Social Justice Warriors have deemed that to be hate speech. The only exception is heterosexual white males – it is open season of those guys – be as critical as you want with them – even if it is not accurate because they are shielded with this fiction known as “White privilege”.
Can a black person be called “lazy” if they are truly lazy or does that mean the person calling the black person lazy is a racist? Can a black person call a black person lazy? What are the SJW rules and regulations pertaining to this situation? Can a female actually be nasty and be called out on it or should females be a protected class of people, where, if the term “nasty” is used to describe them, that automatically means the person using that word is a misogynist and needs to wear that scarlet “M” forever?
What if a male did exactly what Hillary has done in her life and someone called that man “nasty”? Would we have op-ed’s with panties in a bunch over the use of the word? Let’s grow up people.
Look into the salaries of the people on Hillary’s campaign team.  The men are paid about 70% MORE than the women doing comparable tasking.  Old habits die hard, eh Hillary.  Typical Leftist – to wit – do as I say, not as I do.
Trump called her nasty because he would not the word @$$hole.  Mrs Bill Clinton has staked her career on the coat tails of her husband. she has gotten where she is today, not on the basis of her character., not on her accomplishments,  but because she has used her marrage to Bill Clinton as the catalyst. She is nurturing the vagina vote, simple as that.  You and others who are Hillary proponents are voting for her strictly on the basis of her gender, not her accomplishments. She has proven to you, her supporters and the world that she is not trustworthy; has failed at most of her career positions, lied to everyone, covered up her lack of leadership with the Benghazi failure, lied directly to the grieving mothers of 4 dead American heros, got caught running weapons through the Benghazi consulate and lied about the video being responsible for the attack.
She is not worthy of the position of POTUS.  She’s a thoef… stole $200,000+ in White House, US government property when Bill moved out of the White House in 2001. Whitewater, Travelgate, laughing about a rape victim, being kicked off the Nixon Watergate a committee for lying and hiding evidence.  Yes, she’s not just untrustworthy, she is corrupt to her core. and this list isn’t complete.  Talk to the Bernie folks and ask them if they trust her.
Do some researich on the 47+ Clinton affil I ate Secret Service e agents, fri3nds, associates whow has died under mysterious circumstwnces.  Read any of the excerpts from ex Secret Service agents who had to work the Clinton details since 1992 until now….. no one likes her, as she is mean, hateful and vulgar towards them and others.  Yes she can be nice, but calculating towards those who give the Clinton Foundation money, or folks who can advance her spare of power. 
And as for women’s rights, she’s a hypocrite and you know it, though you probably refuse to acknowledge it.  Receiving money from foreign governments to fun the “Clinton Foundation” that do not protect women, do not have equal rights for women, and pay her female campaign staff less money than the men….  ya know, kid… I could go on and on, but will end it here.
I gather you are for women’s rights.  Good thing, but Hillary is not the woman who is a proponent of women’s rights.  She’ll tell you anything in public, but in private she is another person with alternate views.
Come on, Katman, why are you trying to complicate matters with facts and logic?  This country is hell-bent on electing people based on identity politics.

Hispanic Heritage Month concluded on Oct. 15, and now Domestic Violence Awareness Month is coming to an end, but let’s not forget that stopping family violence is just as important as the people running for the 2016 presidential office. Elections come and go, but domestic violence hasn’t stopped.
Since the presidential race started, a lot of talk has been generated about immigrants, in reference to the Hispanic/Latino community. But what the presidential candidates haven’t addressed is the alarming reality for many Hispanic/Latinos in the United States as victims of domestic violence. It is important to know that domestic violence occurs across all communities regardless of age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender, race, religion or nationality. 
About 10 years ago, my aunt came to live with us for a week because her husband had physically abused her in front of her son. As a U.S.-born citizen, I couldn’t understand at that time how her fear of calling the police was greater than the fear of her husband. She didn’t want to report him because she was an undocumented immigrant. As a whole, we need to understand we can’t “save” people like my aunt, we need to be willing to be supportive, help with resources and encourage them to build a safety plan.
The National Latinx Network states that immigrant Hispanic/Latina survivors reported a decrease in the likelihood of calling the police due to heightened immigration enforcement policies and increased fear of deportation. Immigration status is often used as a control mechanism by the perpetrator, so they wouldn’t leave the abusive relationship. Sadly, this election has also caused a anti-immigrant hate rhetoric against our Hispanic/Latino community, which is very dangerous for immigrants who are victims of domestic violence and who might not know they have rights. We need to make sure that all victims of domestic violence are aware of their options.
Regardless of where you stand in this election, I ask that together we take a stand to end the cycle of family violence. Make the National Domestic Violence Hotline 1-800-799-7233 apparent in your office, school, and keep it handy. You never know when someone may need it, use it and survive.
