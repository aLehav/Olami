The Board of Trustees recently elected alumna and real estate professional Stephanie Argyros as its newest member. 
Argyros, who graduated from USC in 1992 with a bachelor’s degree in communication, is also a member of the USC President’s Leadership Council and the Keck School of Medicine of USC’s Board of Overseers. 
“My favorite thing about USC is its strong sense of family,” Argyros told USC News. “I’m so proud to be a Trojan and incredibly honored to join the USC Board of Trustees.”
Along with her position as principal at Arnel, a Costa Mesa-based real estate firm that oversees several properties, Argyros serves as a director of the Argyros Family Foundation. The foundation helped fund USC’s renovation of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum’s peristyle and surrounding plaza with a $7.5 million gift in January 2018, according to USC News.
As a board member for the Children’s Hospital of Orange County and the Orangewood Foundation, which helps current and former foster children in Orange County, Argyros also an advocate of children’s health, well-being and education initiatives. 
“I’m looking forward to getting involved and giving back to the Trojan Family, especially through its support and mentorship programs for youth,” Argyros said to USC News. 
Argyros has also volunteered with Operation Smile, a nonprofit that provides free dental and facial surgeries to children in developing countries, and is a co-chair for WE Day California, an education initiative that encourages young people to be involved in public service and volunteerism.
Interim President Wanda Austin told USC News that she believes Argyros’ public service background will make her a good addition to the Board. 
“Not only is Stephanie Argyros a highly regarded leader in her profession and a great Trojan, she is a dedicated community volunteer,” Austin told USC News. “Her commitment to ensuring children are healthy, happy and empowered to realize their dreams shines through in all her work … We very much look forward to her insight and contributions.”

The Department of Public Safety said most students have complied with the ban of bicycles, skateboards and motorized vehicles at USC Village since it publicized the dismount zone in September. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Department of Public Safety has not been able to maintain a high presence of patrolling officers in USC Village since it began to re-enforce the ban of bicycles, skateboards and motorized vehicles in September. DPS said it does not have enough personnel to watch over the USC Village. 
“At the beginning of the semester, we had additional personnel to help emphasize and publicize the rule,” DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. “Since then, for several weeks now, it’s been our normal, daily deployment of personnel.”
Carlisle explained that typical oversight in USC Village includes unarmed community officers and at least one armed public safety officer who patrols USC Village on bike. 
Although DPS has set up large, A-frame signs detailing the rules of the dismount zone, many students continue to ride freely throughout USC Village. 
In September, DPS noted that they would be enforcing a zero-tolerance policy in the dismount zone by increasing the number of DPS officers, handing out informational flyers and putting up dismount signs. Repeat offenders would be cited to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, the office that oversees judicial processes at USC.  
“There are always people who don’t obey they rules. So we do our best to inform and educate,” Carlisle said. “To my knowledge, there have not been any citations citing students into SJACS for failure to comply. That is generally a last resort.”
Carlisle noted that most students have been complying with the rules and that DPS’ publicizing of the dismount zone has greatly contributed to  this. 
“For the most part, the majority of people do comply,” Carlisle said. “But, it is something that we will continually evaluate … and [we will] continually ask people for their cooperation.”
Andy Woods, a freshman in the Iovine and Young Academy, said dismounting his skateboard in USC Village is not a big burden.
DPS has received periodic complaints about the dangers of bikes and other vehicles from businesses in USC Village and from individuals not affiliated with the University.
“Someone said that they were walking with their children through the village, and DPS officers were enforcing the ‘no biking’ rule,” Carlisle said. “[The woman said] how much [she] appreciated it because it made it easier for her to stroll through with her small children.”
Kaela Gallagher, a freshman in the World Bachelor in Business Program, said she supported looser enforcement because DPS’ time is better spent elsewhere. 
Similar to USC Village, Childs Way from Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to Hahn Plaza, is a dismount zone, despite still seeing heavy amounts of foot and wheel-traffic.
Carlisle said dismount signs are in place in this area, but that enforcement is weak because officer presence is low. Yet, DPS remains certain of the ban’s necessity on campus. 
“There are always new visitors to the Village, some people not affiliated with the University [and] customers, so we think the signs need to remain,” Carlisle said.

Rajendra Thakurathi, who graduated from USC in 2016, created a parody commercial called “Are You Psycho” to encourage water conservation among students, staff and faculty. He received funding from USC’s Green Engagement Fund. (Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan)
A shower at the Bates Motel may be scary, but wasting water is scarier — at least according to USC alumnus Rajendra Thakurathi, whose parody commercial, “Are You Psycho,” encourages viewers to be more mindful about their water usage. 
Thakurathi, who received his master of fine arts in film and television production from the School of Cinematic Arts in 2016, released the one-minute commercial to raise water conservation awareness on campus.
From growing up in Nepal to living in California, Thakurathi said water conservation has always been important to him. 
“My uncle and my relatives used to wake up early in the morning just to get some drinking water from the water tank or water wells because that was the cleaner version of drinking water,” Thakurathi said. “We still don’t have readily available drinking water everywhere, and that has always sat in my consciousness.”

In the commercial, a woman, played by USC alumna Uttera Singh, turns on two faucets and gets in the shower, unaware of her actions. As she is rinsing herself off, an ominous figure appears. As she shrieks, the figure simply turns off the sources of running water and leaves her startled. The final frame reads: “Don’t Be A Psycho; Save Water.” 

The project was made possible with funding from the USC Green Engagement Fund. According to the USC Sustainability website, the fund was created “to fund student-driven projects aimed at increasing sustainability at USC.”

Ahlia Bethea, the USC GEF chairperson at the time, said Thakurathi’s project stood out among those of other candidates. She said what made his idea so exciting was the fresh perspective, as well as his focus on encouraging people to change their habits. 

Thakurathi said when he first came to the United States, he hated seeing people waste water. When he started his studies at USC in 2013, California was experiencing one of the worst droughts in the state’s history.

He said it’s important that USC has done a strong job providing water to its students, but that students don’t think twice about how much water they’re wasting. 

“We don’t have recyclable bins all around the campus,” Thakurathi said. “The [recycle] logo was introduced at USC, which is ironic.”

Thakurathi said he wrote the commercial in 2014, but didn’t have the means to put it together until last year. 

Thakurathi received $3,300 in funding, which he used to cover equipment and production costs and pay his crew. 

He is currently working on a feature film about the caste system in Nepal, as well as a short film focusing on racism in America. Thakurathi said there is usually a socially relevant aspect to his films, but that he tries to make his work meaningful above anything else. 

“With this commercial, I wanted to talk about [saving water], but I didn’t want to shove this agenda down anyone’s throat,” Thakurathi said. “I just wanted to gently and funnily remind them, and I hope people do that.”

Sophomore forward Tara McKeown scored a goal against Washington State in USC’s 3-2 victory to give her 3 goals on the season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The No. 2 women’s soccer team battled down to the last minute to secure a 3-2 win over No. 19 Washington State Saturday night. The Trojans improved to an overall record of 12-1-1 and 5-1-0 record in Pac-12 play.
The win marked the eighth game of the season in which the Trojans scored at least 3 goals, but this game came down to the wire. 
With a 3-1 score, Washington State junior forward Morgan Weaver drew contact from the Trojans, which gave senior defender Maddy Haro the free kick. Haro sent the ball in front of the goal, and freshman forward Molly Myers took the rebound and drilled a shot, bringing the Cougars within 1. However, the Trojan defense was solid for the final 18 minutes and the Cougars ran out of time to find an equalizer. 
This was the first home loss for the Cougars all season. Washington State’s record fell to 10-3-0 overall and 3-3-0 in Pac-12 conference play.
USC senior forward Leah Pruitt put the Trojans on the board first, converting a penalty kick in the 37th minute.
The Trojans doubled their lead at the start of the second half with a goal from sophomore forward Tara McKeown in the 54th minute. McKeown intercepted a Cougar pass in the midfield and turned it into a scoring attack.
Washington State closed the score gap. Not even a minute after McKeown’s goal, the Cougars were gifted with a penalty kick and Haro buried the shot to give Washington State its first goal of the game, bringing the score to 2-1. 
USC then picked up its offensive play. Freshman forward Penelope Hocking’s header found its way to the back of the net in the 63rd minute, giving the Trojans a 3-1 lead.
USC is now 2-1-1 against ranked opponents. The Trojans held a 18-16 shot advantage during the game, though the Cougars led 7-5 with shots on goal. Trojan goalie redshirt sophomore Kaylie Collins had five saves, her third highest total of the season. Saturday night’s game also marks the second time this season that the Trojans have given up more than 1 goal in a game.
On the offensive end, Pruitt leads the Trojan offense with 8 goals this season, with Hocking following close with 7 goals. Pruitt was recognized as USC’s Player of the Game in honor of her goal and assist for the game winner.
The Trojan offense fought to get on the board first and continued creating chances to add to their lead, while the defense held solid against a strong Cougar offense.   
Now past the midway point in Pac-12 play, the Trojans are headed to the final stretch. An almost impenetrable defense and aggressive offense has kept USC ahead in the majority of its games.
To close the season, the Trojans have upcoming games against No. 16 Colorado Oct. 25 and No. 10 UCLA Nov. 4 where they will continue to perfect their game in preparation for the upcoming matches.
The Trojans will return home for two more Pac-12 games, hosting Oregon State Thursday at 3 p.m. and Oregon on Sunday at 1 p.m.

If USC ever puts together a complete game, this team is going to be scary. 
It’s a hypothetical that was repeated way too often last season, when the Trojans eased their way to a Pac-12 title behind quarterback Sam Darnold and a gluttony of talent that, despite the wins, could not produce a signature performance for 60 minutes. 
This season has been much of the same, whether it’s freshman quarterback JT Daniels and the offense still finding their groove, the defense allowing big plays or special teams brain slips that prove costly. For now, at least one of the three has produced enough on a weekly basis for this season to still have hope. 
In Saturday’s 31-20 win over Colorado at the Coliseum that vaulted USC into first place in the Pac-12 South ahead of a pivotal game at Utah next week, it was the defense. Colorado entered the game averaging 38 points and nearly 500 yards of offense per game. The Trojans just spit on those numbers, holding the Buffaloes to 265 yards. Laviska Shenault, one of the top receivers in the country, ran for a 49-yard touchdown for the first score of the game but was otherwise bottled up. USC recorded 16 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, harassing quarterback Steven Montez with a swarming pass rush and bottling up rushing plays even before the handoff. 
And they did it without their leading tackler, senior linebacker Cam Smith, out with a strained hamstring. In his place was freshman Palaie Gaoteote, who looked like Smith with a team-leading nine tackles despite leaving during the third quarter with concussion-like symptoms.  
It was a standout defensive performance, enough to show that Colorado’s offensive stats, as a 5-0 team that hadn’t faced real competition before Saturday, were inflated. It was enough to extend USC’s home win streak under head coach Clay Helton to 19 games, enough to — in Helton’s words — put the Trojans in control of their own destiny in the Pac-12 South. 
But it wasn’t entirely enough to satiate the critics, who will point to the offense’s lackluster performance. Aside from a 21-point spurt in the second quarter that would prove to be enough, Daniels and Co. did not impress. Daniels finished with three touchdown passes and 272 yards, but the freshman passer looked out of sorts early on, and the offense produced nothing but a field goal in the second half. If not for redshirt senior cornerback Ajene Harris’ late pick-six, it would have been a much more uncomfortable win.
Nothing much came on the ground, either. USC rushed for no net gain on 11 first half carries, and its leading rusher, senior Aca’Cedric Ware, had just 23 yards on six carries. The offensive woes were best epitomized by sophomore Stephen Carr’s first half rush that went for a loss of 11 yards, a play where he attempted to cut across the field after being swarmed by defenders, but wound up running backwards. Like a basketball coach trying to stop negative momentum, Helton immediately called a timeout after that befuddling play. 
These setbacks have hurt USC in its losses, and dampened its wins. The Trojans can do better, and the players know it, too.
“We’re slowly putting that big game together,” redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele said.
They’ll need to put it together in a week against Utah in Salt Lake City. The winner takes control over the Pac-12 South, and Utah is on a roll, coming off back-to-back thrashings of Stanford and Arizona. The Utes have a stingy defense that will bother Daniels more than Colorado did, and they’ve suddenly found a high-powered offense to boot, racking up 40-plus points in their last two games.
“We haven’t put together a complete game,” senior safety Marvell Tell said. “We haven’t reached our potential yet.”
Halfway through the season, the jury is still out on USC, and next week will tell us a lot about whether this team can put together an all-around performance in its biggest game to date.

There are more than 80 religious organizations on USC’s campus, each offering a different experience for students of faith. From the outside looking in, religious practices can seem strange. Perhaps one of the most peculiar and contested practices is the attempted conversion to one’s faith, also known as proselytizing. Religious groups sharing their faith in public or trying to convince students to join them can be an uncomfortable experience, but it is necessary to freedom of thought and expression. Though there are many ways proselytizing can go wrong, it is ultimately an essential part of creating a diverse, supportive campus for religious and nonreligious students alike. 
Students less familiar with religious practice may not understand the reasons behind proselytizing. The answer is simply that it is required by their religious doctrine. In Islam, proselytizing is called Dawah (the call toward God) and is encouraged throughout the Quran. One of the principal texts of Mahayana Buddhism reveals that anyone can achieve enlightenment and that bodhisattva, those who are permitted to achieve nirvana, should devote their time to helping others achieve enlightenment, although  most Buddhist sects are generally discouraged from aggressive proselytizing. In Christianity, spreading belief in Christ is called “the great commission”; Matthew 28:19, NIV, instructs the faithful to “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name, of the father, and of the son and of the holy spirit.”
In a culture that increasingly values the pursuit of individual freedoms, sharing religious beliefs can be uncomfortable. College serves as an echo chamber for ideas, which often circulate within like-minded groups, causing colleges to be breeding grounds for ideological and cultural uniformity. Challenging that homeostasis isn’t easy and can lead to proselytizers using more aggressive tactics to get their points across, such as forcing students to take religious literature or not letting them leave after they say they are not interested. Doctrines and ancient texts don’t mean much to a student trying to get to class on time. An unplanned encounter with a proselytizer can be irritating at best and draining at worst. 
It can be tempting to say proselytizing should be banned outright, but that can be problematic. Religious students may feel unsafe at school if a ban is too broad. Since “proselytizing” is a term that can encompass a broad set of religious speech, students may find that their speech is increasingly policed. An outright ban also prohibits an important exchange of ideas. There are some students who do not know what they believe until someone in college shared their faith with them. From that point on, they’ve gained a valuable support system to anchor them throughout their education. The National Alliance on Mental Health describes how religiosity can lead to an increased sense of purpose and help people deal with difficult life situations.
With that in mind, religious students need to be mindful of how they share their beliefs with other students. The University can address this by outlining protections for students who feel they cannot escape an uncomfortable conversion experience. Proselytizers need to be held to standards that prioritize the needs of the students they approach, such as letting them exit a conversation the second they feel uncomfortable. Instead of approaching students with judgment, they can focus on sharing a message of love that keeps the other person safe from pitfalls of bigotry.
Religious conversations are rarely easy. However, as a salient part of many students’ identities, they are a necessary part of a vibrant campus community and should be protected. Like all speech, there needs to be regulation to ensure the majority of the student body can have a safe learning environment. A prime example is Georgetown University, which worked with religious student groups to refine a 2007 ban on proselytizing on campus, eventually landing on an open policy for religious groups to spread their faith, as long as they do not practice in ways that “depersonalize” other students. If USC can get to a place where both religious and nonreligious groups of students feel heard, it may be able to love instead of anger.

Oct. 10 marked World Mental Health Day, an annual advocacy event supported by the World Health Organization that emphasizes mental health advocacy and informing the public on the topic. To commemorate the day, many Twitter users, including celebrities, shared their stories and encouraged followers to do the same. Lady Gaga even co-wrote an essay in The Guardian on suicide, using her platform to remind readers that “we can all be a part of a new movement — including people who have faced mental illness themselves — to call on governments and industry to put mental health at the top of their agendas.”
But before we march on Washington, I can’t help but ask: Is the world’s mental health crisis truly anybody’s fault? What would a mental health “movement” even look like?
A fitting theme for this column, this year the WHO focused on promoting constructive discourse among young people, highlighting that half of all mental illnesses begin by the age of 14 and that suicide is the second leading cause of death for teenagers and young adults. Yes, World Mental Health Day is critically important to raising awareness; people need to understand that “it’s okay not to be okay.” But I can only hope that the movement doesn’t end on Oct. 10: Recognizing and addressing warning signs — both in our loved ones and ourselves — should be a priority year-round.
As they join the wave of increasing social awareness, many young people are beginning to understand mental health is an immediate problem that is taking an immense toll on the world’s population. Much of this insight is expressed through social media, which creates, to some extent, a supportive community; I can log onto Twitter right now and pull up several viral posts reminding users that they’re not alone in their struggles. Some are personal narratives; some are simple links to the suicide hotline; all help people realize that their problems are, in fact, pretty normal.
But for some reason, these productive conversations don’t transfer to the real world.
That’s why I would argue that change starts with engaging in open and honest communication — because, as I’ve come to realize, the people who struggle the most are often the ones you’d least expect. Since I started writing this column in January, several close friends have come forward with their own stories of combating mental illness, expressing their appreciation of my efforts to help tear down the stigma surrounding such a common issue. And while it was comforting to know I was offering at least some indirect support, I also began to realize just how severely mental health struggles are affecting my peers. 
Quite honestly, it’s a shame that it took an entire column for some of my friends to discuss their struggles with me. Indeed, it’s safe to say that many people want to seek support for their problems, but avoid uncomfortable confrontation due to fear of being judged or misunderstood. That’s why, now more than ever, we need to give young people the opportunity to express their mental health concerns through an outlet that doesn’t involve a screen. 
Much of this dilemma can be solved by giving students access to counselors that can assess and help remedy their struggles. At USC, the Engemann Student Health Center has been a subject of criticism for failing to provide students with adequate mental health support services: A recent Daily Trojan feature underlined the fact that 70 percent of students who attempt to make therapy appointments are referred elsewhere. Robert Mendola, the executive director and division chief for counseling and mental health at USC, said the department seems to be so understaffed that one therapist oversees 1,800 students.
However, I must commend the center’s staff for acknowledging the facility’s shortcomings and making tangible steps to improve its efficiency. Engemann has reported that it will add 12 new full-time therapists over the next two years; so far, the center has added five. Mendola cited his own priority of removing the waitlist at Engemann.
 “To send a student without a car [and] with a tight schedule to take an hour each way just to see someone for 50 minutes is not realistic,” Mendola said. 
As the University works out its own structural issues, I cannot emphasize enough that taking the initiative to communicate mental health concerns is crucial to developing mental resilience. Remember: The first step on the road to recovery must be taken by yourself — big steps, small steps, there’s no rush. Start a conversation and see where it leads. And before you know it, you’ve started your own movement.

Dariel Fillomeno | Daily Trojan
No discussion about women in music is complete without mention of Taylor Swift. Few celebrities have been as harshly critiqued or widely idolized in the past decade as the country-turned-pop star. Behind the singer’s cult of personality lies an army of Swifties — a group to which I belonged for some time. 
My high school friend group worshipped at Swift’s shrine. When I turned 15, I remember sitting on the blue plastic bench (my lunchtime spot for the year), my friends crouched beside me playing “Fifteen,” a coming-of-age tradition.
“Fifteen” shows Swift at her most nostalgic, reflecting on the larger-than-life wonder of adolescence. Her biggest worry is that she won’t catch the attention of enough handsome senior boys. When she gets one to like her, their first kiss makes her head spin and she swears he’s “the one.”  
On the other hand, I spent age 15 in a relationship with a boy I didn’t like. Our first kiss came a month into “dating” because I felt pressured into it. For a year, I hated any physical displays of affection and dreaded the thought of him being the person I spent the rest of my life with. Fifteen wasn’t a magical time of discovery and hope, but a drudge through self-loathing and internalized hatred as a result of failed high school relationships.
When I broke up with him, I chopped off my hair and molded it into a pixie cut. Shortly after, Swift ditched her country roots and became the biggest pop star on the planet with “1989.” We both asserted power by redefining how others saw us — she through sound and I through appearance. Seeing her succeed on her own terms made me realize I could do the same. As long as we carried ourselves with confidence, everything else would work itself out. 
Like so many others, everyone in my friend group picked up a deluxe copy of “1989” from Target. It was the only thing we listened to together, and it became a symbol of our bond. I could reach out to them and the world through Swift. If everyone loved her, then they could love me through her music as well. 
I told a boy I was interested in him as a brother — only for him to drag my name through the mud in retaliation for not reciprocating his feelings. I spent days crying over the lost friendship, perplexed by what I did wrong. Should I have rolled over and given him what he wanted, exchanging public ridicule for private shame? Was the pain he caused me somehow my fault for not complying?
Not if Swift had anything to say about it. In 2016, Kanye West released “Famous,” a song Swift objected to because in it, West called her a “bitch” and took credit for her success. After winning Album of the Year at the Grammys, she scorned West in her acceptance speech, claiming victory in the name of any women whose success had been belittled by a man — including myself. In Swift’s world, kindness triumphed over lies. Her victory was mine.
But it didn’t last. The tides turned when Kim Kardashian exposed her as a “snake” on Snapchat, sharing recorded conversations confirming Swift’s foreknowledge and approval of the very lyric she bashed West for supposedly blindsiding her with at the Grammys. Swift’s explanations for her behavior came off as half-hearted excuses, and the internet subsequently canceled her. I didn’t know what to do. This person I made out to be perfect in my mind could be downright manipulative, even mean. The pedestal I thought she stood on was actually little more than a manufactured illusion. 
The concept of “Taylor Swift” was just that. The world I thought she created wasn’t real either. The friends who played “Fifteen” at the lunch benches discarded me when I became an inconvenience. A culture that promoted and valued women turned out to be one filled with abuse. The music world cared more about sales and streams than challenging consumers with innovative content. 
“Reputation” sealed this for me. Swift doubled down on playing the victim and blaming others for her mistakes. She again remade her sound in an effort to transform her scales into wings. I sat through all 15 tracks, unfazed and unfooled. I knew better than to fall for her tricks again. 
I’m not sure if this is solely my experience or that of a multitude of disenfranchised former Swifties. My relationship with Swift today is rocky at best. I realize I can’t distance myself from her legacy because I, like so many others, am a part of it. 
It wasn’t fair for me, or anyone else to expect so much from her. When fandom eclipses your sense of identity, it can be difficult to draw a line in the sand. I let my infatuation with the person she marketed eclipse my love of the music, a mistake many of her fans continue to make. 
I now keep my distance while listening to her discography and observing her career, having separated myself from my perceptions of Swift. For my 20th birthday, I’m still going cheer her on from afar, but this time I promise to write my own story instead of copying hers.

Australian pop boy band 5 Seconds of Summer capped off the North American leg of its “Meet You There” tour with a sold-out crowd at the Greek Theatre on Friday night. After a three-year hiatus until the recent release of its latest album “Youngblood,” 5SOS is now back on the road. 
Indie pop band The Aces opened the evening with live renditions of their groovy synth hits. While audience members were not familiar with their music, the all-girl band was able to get the crowd on their feet for the entire set on Friday.
As the rain became heavier, fans began to huddle under the bleachers. However, when the lights dimmed, they ran back to their seats for the first notes of 5SOS’ hit track “Babylon.”
The pop rock group was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd, but interruptions from rain and loud cheers made the song unrecognizable until the chorus. 
Eighties rock-influenced “Talk Fast” was the second song of the night. Like its title, the song was fast-paced and had the crowd dancing in unison. Next was “Moving Along,” a slower song about just getting by after ending a relationship. The crowd brought the same energy to the two stylistically different songs.
“She’s Kinda Hot,” the lead single of 5SOS’ second album, was out of place on the setlist due to its more aggressive punk sound — a diversion from its newer pop songs. While the crowd still brought plenty of energy, the two songs felt mismatched played back-to-back.
This awkward transition was soon forgotten when 5SOS performed “Waste the Night.” From its newest album “Youngblood,” “More” and “Better Man” maintained the enthusiastic cheers that filled the venue, while disco-influenced “If Walls Could Talk” had the crowd dancing once again.
The band then wheeled out a piano, foreshadowing the slower songs to come. They remarked that “Ghost of You,” a song about slowly finding out that a lover has left for good, sounded even more melancholy in the rain. The set concluded with “Want You Back,” the first single off “Youngblood.” 
The encore consisted of two songs, the band’s first and most recent singles. “She Looks So Perfect,” released in 2014, paid homage to 5SOS’ humble roots, while latest single “Youngblood” was representative of the group’s new pop sound.
The crowd carried much of the show Friday night. The band repeatedly thanked fans for not forgetting about them after three years, but not much else was said between songs. Even when the crowd lost its energy, it took a couple of songs to get them engaged once again. 
5SOS delivered a good performance at the Greek Theatre, but it was the crowd’s devotion that kept the night from falling flat.

Released Friday, director Damien Chazelle’s “First Man” follows Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) and the Apollo 11 mission that led to him being the first man on the moon. (Photo from IMDb)
At the end of 2016, Ryan Gosling and director Damien Chazelle were propelled to the top of the film industry thanks to their critically acclaimed hit musical film, “La La Land.” Both Chazelle and Gosling were nominated for Academy Awards, leaving audiences speculating over whether their next endeavor would rival the dazzling success of the movie. This weekend, the duo’s latest project — “First Man”— was released. The move from a vibrant musical to an enthralling biopic is a leap to the opposite end of the narrative spectrum, but Chazelle and Gosling prove that their complementary talents still have much to offer. 
Gosling stars as Neil Armstrong in the decade of his life leading up to his historic moon landing. For the astronaut and his wife, Janet (Claire Foy), it was a period mainly characterized by the deaths of family and friends, despite the attempt to move to a new city and advance his career.
After every tragedy, Chazelle shows the moon beckoning, almost taunting Armstrong in the sunset sky — a motif foreshadowing something greater than scientific achievement: the ultimate escape from the pangs of earthly life. 
Shedding the romantic, Hollywood veneer of “La La Land,” Chazelle filmed “First Man” in a pseudo-documentary style; techniques such as grainy ’60s images and handheld cameras are used in typical documentary fashion to support Chazelle’s commitment to realism. Along with composer Justin Hurwitz’s lusciously moody score, the entire experience envelops the audience in the same gloomy atmosphere the Armstrongs found themselves in throughout the 1960s. 
“First Man” is a quiet, subtle film thin on exposition (except for the occasional jargon-filled NASA scenes) especially when it comes to character development, but the strong performances  succeed in transmitting feelings rather than thoughts. 
Gosling and Foy’s performances consist mostly of thinking. Armstrong especially does not speak much, and everything he does say seems to have undergone lengthy internal deliberation. He is a careful calculator of both life and work — tough to decipher — but made accessible by Gosling’s performance. 
Like the film itself, Gosling’s performance is focused on transmitting Armstrong’s dynamic character — he is gleefully playing with his kids in one scene, and receiving tragic news in the next. Gosling gave this turn of events a profound heaviness, as his entire countenance tightens up and he visibly absorbs the painful moments where death catches up to him yet again. 
Visual and musical swells are reserved for scenes in outer space, suggesting a type of romance between Armstrong and the cosmos. When asked by a NASA interview committee why he believes space exploration is so important, Armstrong replies that seeing everything from such heights gives humans a necessary perspective on their lives. It is this perspective that he so desperately craves in the face of so much tragedy, fueling his determination to reach the ultimate point of perspective: the moon. 
The climax of the film arrives with the Apollo 11 mission. During the first mission’s launch sequence, the camera is placed inside the cockpit; consequently, the images are shaky and unintelligible, mirroring what the astronauts themselves would see in that moment. There are only two images that come across crystal clear: Armstrong’s eyes and the distant moon as he stares it down with determination and longing. As he hurtles toward his destiny, he looks to his left and sees Earth as a tiny, blue-green spot. The place where tragedy reigns is rendered insignificant in the vast cosmos. 
“First Man” is a biographical film that is not satisfied with merely recounting chronological events, but rather with exploring the souls of those involved. As a result, the moon landing scene cares not for what the event meant to the United States (the film omits the key moment of Armstrong planting the flag), but rather emphasizes the profoundly personal moment the astronaut quietly made peace with his melancholic circumstances.

Senior linebacker Porter Gustin will miss the remainder of the 2018 season with a fractured right ankle sustained in the fourth quarter of USC’s win over Colorado on Saturday night, ending his collegiate career. 
After the game, Gustin stood at midfield with his right shoe off and his foot appearing red and swollen. He was carted off of the field and hopped on one foot into the locker room.
Gustin has been dealing with injuries since summer practices, when he suffered from a torn meniscus. Despite his knee injury, Gustin did not miss playing time. Following the Arizona game, he showed signs of an apparent ankle injury. During the bye week, Gustin sat out of practice to recover, but he did participate in limited capacity during the week leading up to the Colorado game.
Gustin is one of four captains of the Trojans this season. His departure will further hinder the defense from a leadership and talent standpoint after fellow captain senior linebacker Cam Smith was kept out of the Colorado matchup due to a hamstring injury.
Gustin tallied 28 tackles this season, but has been most notable for his rush. In 2018, he touted seven sacks, tied for sixth in the nation. The rest of the USC defense has combined for a total of six sacks so far.
The loss of Gustin will undoubtedly hinder USC in its upcoming matchup against Utah on Saturday. Utes’ junior running back Zack Moss boasts 617 rushing yards, the sixth most in the Pac-12. The matchup has serious Pac-12 championship implications as the winner will take over the lead in the South Division.
