One month ago, the USC women’s basketball team was coasting toward a postseason berth.
Having won eight of their last nine games at that point, the Women of Troy sat just outside the national rankings with a 12-4 record.
Second chance · Briana Gilbreath, who scored 17 points against Stanford Jan. 22, looks to lead the Women of Troy at Galen Center. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Next came a disastrous trip to the Bay Area.
USC (15-8, 7-5) put points on the board at California but couldn’t keep its opponent from grabbing every critical rebound. The Women of Troy lost 82-71.
Then came the debacle against then-No. 4 Stanford — a 95-51 reality check that dropped the Women of Troy to 4-3 in conference play.
A pair of wins against the Oregon schools last week restored USC to its winning ways, but this week’s homestand will play a key role in determining the team’s postseason fate.
And with Cal (14-10, 6-7) and Stanford (22-2, 13-0) visiting the Galen Center, junior guard Briana Gilbreath said the team has added incentive to perform.
“It gives us more motivation, especially with Stanford being ranked so high and losing the way we did,” Gilbreath said. “Both games we thought we should have played better.”
First on the docket is a game tonight against No. 3 Stanford, which enters the contest on a 16-game winning streak. Last month, the Cardinal jumped out to an early double-digit advantage and led 67-38 at halftime.
“We have to look at the mistakes we made early on in the game,” Gilbreath said. “Against Stanford you have to play 40 minutes of solid basketball with minimal mistakes because they capitalize on every one.”
For much of the season, rebounding has been a barometer for the Women of Troy’s success. When the USC team rebounds well, it tends to win. And when it doesn’t, the results are often disastrous.
Against Cal, the Women of Troy collected just 22 rebounds. USC was out-rebounded 54-36 by the Cardinal.
“There were some times during the Cal and Stanford game where we didn’t box out and they got crucial offensive rebounds,” Gilbreath said. “Boxing out on both ends of the court will be very important.”
If the Women of Troy are able to solve their rebounding issues, Gilbreath said they have an excellent shot at reaching their ultimate goal: the NCAA tournament. Earlier this season, USC coach Michael Cooper said his team would probably need 20 wins to lock up a berth in the tournament.
“These games are two stepping stones to where we’re trying to get,” Gilbreath said. “If we can get five or six wins in these last six games that would be amazing.”
USC takes on Stanford at 7 p.m. tonight at the Galen Center. Tipoff for the Cal game is scheduled for Sunday at 2 p.m.
GYEAH USC!

An estimated 5,129 students voted online and approximately 500 voted using paper ballots for the Undergraduate Student Government elections. The polls closed at 8 p.m. Thursday, according to Juan Orjuela, Elections and Recruitment co-chair.
USG hoped to get 6,000 votes, over one third of the undergraduate population.
“We’re pretty happy with the numbers right now,” Orjuela said. “Even though it’s a little below our goal, we’re pretty happy with the results.”
Last year, 4,561 students voted online and 125 students voted by paper ballots. The significant increase in paper ballots is due to the inclement weather Tuesday and internet problems at the Lyon Center and Finger Fountain polling locations.
“On Wednesday we got a lot of paper ballots because of the rain,” Orjuela said. “We couldn’t use the computers at certain locations because they could get wet.”
Because some people could vote both using paper ballots and online, Orjuela estimates that 400 of the paper ballots will count for a total of approximately 5,500 votes.
USG attributed the overall increase in voting to providing food at peak hours and increased publicity about voting. The Tommy Trojan poll had food trucks all three days from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
“I counted about 60 people waiting in line when we had the In ‘n Out Truck.” said Mikey Geragos, a Greek Senator who volunteered at the polling stations. “The line was consistently that long for a good hour and a half.”
The other polling booths gave pizza and water to voting students.
“In years past we’ve served breakfast and had donuts at polls, but we learned that almost no students come out to vote early in the morning,” said Liz Trower, Director of Communications. “That’s also why we moved back the poll opening times from 8 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and closing times to 6 p.m.”
Competition also increased because more total candidates, 28, ran this year than in the past four.
“There weren’t any major problems, we increased voter turnout and everything went smoothly,” Orjuela said. “We’re really happy and excited about how things went.”
The unofficial election results will be announced Tuesday at the weekly senate meeting in the Campus Center.

Right now, as people in the entertainment industry tell me, we are in the midst of awards season.
We had the Golden Globes and the Grammys. The Academy Awards and James Beard Foundation Awards are right around the corner.
Thus, since we are literally right in the middle of it all, it made perfect sense to give some awards out to the best of USC sports in the last year.
I present to you the first, and probably last, Kenny Awards. All winners can stop by Traddies and buy me a beer to pick up their trophies (which might or might not be Kevin O’Neill bobbleheads).
Coach of the Year: Jovan Vavic. This is Vavic’s first Kenny award and quite frankly, it was the easiest decision since LeBron James chose to stay with the Cavs.
The men’s and women’s water polo coach simply can’t be stopped.
Take away 10 seniors from Vavic’s two-time defending NCAA champion men’s team? That’s fine. He’ll just make it a three-peat.
Think he’s burned out from the long and grueling men’s season in the fall and that he’ll just coast in the spring with the ladies?
Well, there he goes, jumping in the pool in May after the final buzzer sounds for another national title.
With football and basketball down, USC is starting to turn into a water polo school, which isn’t the worst thing in the world.
Honorable mention: Men’s tennis coach Peter Smith and women’s volleyball coach Mick Haley.
Dishonorable mention:  Lou Holtz and former USC baseball coach Chad Kreuter. You don’t get to go to Traddies, but you can stop by the 9-0 and buy me a beer as your reward. No Kevin O’Neill bobblehead for you.
Play of the Year: Murphy Troy’s kick save. If you haven’t seen what men’s volleyball player Murphy Troy did last month against UCLA, pull out your smart phone or open a new tab on your web browser, search Google for “Murphy Troy kick save” and open the first link. You won’t regret it.
After a long rally, Troy falls out of bounds while going for a dig.
He missed the dig because a teammate tipped it in the air before he got to it. But the deflection goes straight to Troy who, from his seat, kicked the ball over the net.
USC eventually won the point. Not only was it an amazing play, but that effort gave USC set point at 25-24.
Honorable mentions: Robert Woods’ falling-out-of-bounds touchdown catch against California and freshman women’s soccer player Autumn Altamirano’s game-winning goal against UCLA in front of a record-setting crowd in the Coliseum.
Dishonorable mention: Any time the USC defense was on the field in the final two minutes of a football game.
Upset of the Year: Men’s basketball win over Texas. This not only won a Kenny for Upset of the Year, but also for WTF Moment of the Year, and the Why Can’t You Play Like This Every Time? award.
Just to set the record straight: In December, USC, which has lost to the likes of Rider, Bradley and just about every Pac-10 school, beat — no, slaughtered — Texas, which is about to become the No. 1 team in the country, 73-56.
The Trojans dominated in every phase of the game and even made 79.3 percent of their free throws. I’m still convinced Texas sent its B team.
Honorable mention: This one just blows everything else out of the water.
Dishonorable mention: The Purdue women’s golf team for beating USC by one stroke for the national title.
The Aron Ralston Courage Award: Women’s basketball player Jacki Gemelos. Gemelos would’ve received a Kenny back in 2006 for Top Recruit, if the Kennys had existed then.
As a freshman, she came in as the No. 1 recruit in the nation and hopes were high for USC women’s basketball. But then she tore her ACL.
After redshirting and months of grueling rehab, she was ready to get on the court the next season.
Then she tore her ACL again. After another eight months of therapy, she got back to practice only to tear her other ACL.
I just tore my ACL and am scared to go through one bout of rehab.
But Gemelos never quit, and finally, three and a half years after she was supposed to get on the court, played her first collegiate game Feb. 4, 2010 and hasn’t looked back. I’ll buy her a beer for that (don’t worry Jacki, you still get the Kevin O’Neill bobblehead too).
And the last Kenny award of the night goes to…
Best Montenegrin to play USC basketball: Nikola Vucevic. I was going to give this to Donte Smith, but then I realized he wasn’t Montenegrin. Who knew?
That’s all the Kennys I have for this year. But if you still want a Kevin O’Neill bobblehead, and I know you do, go to the men’s basketball game Feb. 24. You will not be disappointed.
“Spittin’ Sports” runs Fridays. To comment on this article e-mail Kenny at klegan@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team, despite its unceremonious first-round playoff exit last season, might have eradicated any doubts as to which team should headline the list of this year’s top national title contenders Thursday night.
Strong effort · Senior setter Riley McKibben helped propel the Trojans to a win over the No. 5 Cardinal — the reigning NCAA champions. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (7-1, 7-1) embraced the opportunity to announce their arrival as NCAA men’s volleyball’s dominant power, defeating last year’s reigning national champion and historic rival Stanford.
After suffering an unexpected loss to No. 11 Pepperdine in five sets last Friday on the road in Malibu, Calif., many, including the coaching staff, were curious to see how the Trojans would respond to their first dose of adversity this season.
Their emphatic response was a 25-15, 25-14, 25-21 victory against No. 5 Stanford (9-4, 6-4), in which the Cardinal often looked outclassed, especially in regard to net play.
“[The loss] is all we’ve been thinking about [since last Friday],” said freshman libero Henry Cassiday, who anchored the backcourt defense with 10 of the team’s 38 digs. “We wanted to come out with extra fire tonight and to bring a lot of energy to the court with us.”
In the first set, both teams exhibited some nervous energy, as both squads mishit — and even whiffed — on some routine kill opportunities, and committed a fair number of service errors.
Senior setter Riley McKibbin quickly reset the tone for the rest of the match with several inspired diving efforts to keep certain kills in play.
The second set followed a similar progression, with senior opposite hitter Tri Bourne and senior middle blocker Austin Zahn emerging to dominate the net.
Throughout the game, the Cardinal was helpless against the Trojans’ big men, only managing to register one block.
In addition to trampling the Cardinal in the blocking game eight and a half to one, USC also controlled the service game.
Through a quick three sets, the host Trojans hastily registered seven aces compared to zero for Stanford, while also committing four fewer service errors.
With a 17-14 lead in the third set, the Stanford players and bench, sunken throughout much of the match, began to awaken, sensing a shift in momentum.
The Trojans quickly quashed any Cardinal hopes on tightening the match, however, as they rattled off an 8-1 scoring streak on the strength of junior opposite hitter Tony Ciarelli’s masterful serving.
“Tony was phenomenal all night,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “After a sub-par game against Pepperdine, I knew he was going to come out tonight with greater focus.”
Also impressive was how the Trojans outwitted the Cardinal in many instances, whether they smartly chose placement over power when spiking the ball or made sound, split-second judgments as to which balls were heading in and out of bounds.
“They’re always a tough group of competitors,” Bourne said. “I grew up with them, and many of them are my good friends, which makes this win so much better.”
Following the game, Ferguson quickly dismissed any tactical discussion or mention of executing game plans.
Instead, he wished to simply commend his team for its resiliency and readiness to move past the obvious low point of the season thus far.

In arguably its most complete road performance of the 2010-2011 season, the USC men’s basketball team defeated California Thursday night, 78-75.
On a night when the Trojans (14-12, 6-7) received double-doubles from junior forward Nikola Vucevic (19 points and 10 rebounds) and senior forward Alex Stepheson (10 points and 11 rebounds), it was the outside shooting of freshman guard Maurice Jones (Pac-10 high 22 points) that kept the team ahead for the final 30 minutes of the contest.
Ironically, Jones was not in the starting lineup for USC coach Kevin O’Neill for the first time all season, as senior guard Donte Smith started in his place.
After the game was deadlocked at 11-11 midway through the first half, the Trojans’ clamped down at the defensive end holding the Bears (13-13, 6-7) without a point for a five-minute stretch.
USC used a 13-0 run to take a commanding 33-22 lead in the break.
In the second half, Jones took over for the Trojans, connecting on five 3-point baskets. Cal, behind junior forward Harper Kamp (16 points and 9 rebounds), cut the gap to one on multiple occasions early in the half, but Jones caught fire for a seven-minute period, scoring 18 points and pushing the lead back to 57-47 with 10 minutes to play.
All five Cal starters scored in double figures, including senior center Markhuri Sanders-Frison who had a career-high with 23 points, but poor perimeter defense proved to be the difference, as the Bears gave up 61.5 percent from three-point range, en route to their fourth straight conference loss.
For USC, the next stop is Maples Pavilion to take on the Stanford Cardinal (13-12, 6-8) Saturday night at 7:30 p.m.
The Trojans will try to do something they have yet to achieve all season: win consecutive games on the road.

Daniel Packard, dating expert and “social acupuncturist,” said that the goal of his show was to “answer the WTFs? of life” — mainly, why relationships between men and women can seem so right sometimes and so wrong a few minutes later.
On Wednesday night, Packard launched headfirst into gender differences and was quick to highlight the glaring differences between men and women. Packard explained how men are “hunter-humpers,” who are relatively simple, stay in the present, and are fun-seeking. However, when it comes to the dating game, men are at a vast disadvantage.
Using fun and effective group exercises, Packard began to show the “female members of the audience how their quick judgments of men (“he’s an asshole,” “he’s creepy” and “he’s a jerk,” for example) were actually preventing them from meeting many great men who were waiting from them out there. These men just need a little help in getting things started.
Packard was quick to point out that many men have done terrible things to women and acted like complete idiots, even orchestrating a group apology from the handful of male audience members. With his foundation set, Packard discussed what he sees as a big root of the problem between men and women.
Using a hilarious role-play (a female audience member played a man, Packard played a woman in the club), Packard demonstrated many of the contradictions that men must navigate when trying to meet a woman. The female audience member was instructed to attempt to start a conversation with Packard, but every response prompted a rejection. Packard told the woman to make him feel sexy, but when the woman started he called her a creep. When the woman tried to act disinterested, Packard called her a jerk for not being interested, and wondered why the woman wasn’t appreciating the hours he’d spent getting ready.
Ending this segment with a short clip from the music video of Baby Got Back (in which Sir Mixalot actually dances on top of an enormous butt), Packard demonstrated the double-standard men must face.
“If a woman wants more attention, she can wear a tighter shirt,” Packard said. “If a man wants more attention, he has to start a band.”
Packard explained that, with women quick to judge and reject guys on almost arbitrary grounds, men are being scared into not knowing how to act like men anymore. Packard even asked the women in the audience how many of them had forgotten that men have feelings, and about 60 to 70 percent of women in attendance raised their hands.
“We don’t often give a lot of compassion to guys,” he said.
Waiting around for Prince Charming to come save you, Packard explained, causes women to put their sense of self into the hands of other people. When Prince Charming doesn’t appear, women are quick to blame men for their problems, rather than taking an honest look at themselves.
“Some of the judgment you dump on guys is your own issues,” Packard stated.
Women get caught in a cycle of complaining and affirming each other’s complaining that is toxic, unproductive, and resolves nothing.
“Less complaining and more smiling would benefit everyone on the planet,” Packard said. “If you can be kinder to [men], we can be stronger.”
Packard even mentioned the idea of karma.
“When you’re cruel to us, when you objectify us, karmically it comes back to you,” Packard added.
But the real solution comes through one’s sense of self.
“When we know who we are we care a lot less about what other people think,” Packard said.
A strong, self-assured sense of self creates stronger women and stronger women. And when women are kind and open, it’s much easier for men to just be men.
“Love is the reward for getting our shit together,” Packard concluded.

It’s already five games into the young season, but the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team has yet to face its biggest challenge.
Tonight, USC travels to No. 12 Long Beach State hoping to improve its record to 5-1 against the 49ers.
This game, however, is only half of their weekend — USC kicks off conference play at No. 7 San Diego State on Saturday.
The Women of Troy know this weekend is important for them, as they have the opportunity to set the tone for the entire season of conference games.
“The first conference game is pretty big,” said sophomore driver Dominique Sardo. “We can just go out and set the standard. We just want to go out there and dominate to be exact and we want to show everybody what we can do so that they kind of get scared of us.”
Coming off last week’s 19-4 victory against Cal Baptist, the team is feeling confident and is looking forward to bringing their highly competitive attitudes to Long Beach and San Diego State.
“We’re definitely looking to make a statement to let people know that we mean business and want to win the National Championship again,” said freshman two-meter Madeline Rosenthal. “We don’t take any team lightly and we want to show people that even though we lost a lot of people last year that we can still beat teams like Long Beach and San Diego.”
A big part of USC’s success so far is the the play of the newcomers on the team.
Many new players, like Rosenthal and freshman goalie Flora Bolonyai, have stepped up.
These young girls, however, still acknowledge they have a long way to go.
“The team is definitely trying to make me better, toughen me up and make sure I’m keeping up with all the new material because it’s a brand new system for me,” Rosenthal said.
Many of the veterans on the team have also stepped up and become role models and mentors for the younger girls, helping the new teammates to feel comfortable with a new team.
“Kristen Dronberger is one of the best players I’ve ever seen,” said Rosenthal. “As a freshman, I totally strive to be the kind of player she is. Joelle Bekhazi is also so knowledgeable and has almost become my mentor in a sense.”
All these factors contribute to a more important goal for the team: Coming together as a unit.
And the Women of Troy know if they are to repeat as champions, their success hinges on the effort of everybody.
“We’re coming together really well as a team unit,” Sardo said “Every practice day by day we get better and we learn to work with each other better. We’re all coming together and keeping the high energy in the practices and just trying to keep each other confident and keep our heads in the game.”

Curfews are a thing of the past for most college students, but Otis Clarke had to be in his dorm by 4 p.m. from Jan. 26 until Jan. 31.
Clarke, a junior majoring in Middle East studies and linguistics, arrived in Egypt on Jan. 19 to study abroad at the American University in Cairo. He had planned to study in Cairo for four months and had enrolled in Egyptian history, anthropology and Arabic language classes before evacuating the country Jan. 31 because of the protests and political unrest in Egypt.

The Egyptian revolution began Jan. 25, just six days after Clarke landed in Egypt. There were street demonstrations, marches, riots and labor strikes in Cairo and throughout the country. The protestors wanted to remove Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from office to bring an end to corruption, repression and reforms of the political system. Mubarak resigned Feb. 11.
Clarke was looking forward to experiencing Egyptian culture, but he is now taking the semester off before returning to USC in the fall.
“As a Middle East studies major, I was obviously looking for an overseas program in that area,” Clarke said. “The one located in Egypt seemed the most appealing to me because the history of that country is so interesting. Plus, Egypt is one of the more influential countries in the Arab region, both politically and culturally.”
Clarke was the only student from USC to attend the American University in Cairo for the spring 2011 semester, but was placed in a dormitory with other college students from universities across the United States. Clarke arrived Jan. 19 for orientation week, but did not understand the extent of the civil unrest in Egypt.
“Our orientation leaders and other people at the dorms were keeping us apprised of what was going around us,” he said. “We did have a television, so we were able to watch CNN and Al Jazeera. But even with that sort of access, we still did not know the full extent of the protests.”
Because the dorms were located on an island in the neighborhood of Zamalek in Cairo, away from the center of the riots, Clarke said he and his fellow students were never truly fearful for their safety. The private security in the dorms made them even less afraid.
“None of us really felt the full effect of the demonstrations because we were so isolated,” Clarke said. “I didn’t witness anything violent firsthand, but it was definitely a unique experience to be in the middle of such an historical event, especially when I got back to the States and saw how bad it really was.”
On Jan. 25, the orientation leaders informed the students of the government-imposed curfew, and also urged them not to go anywhere near Tahrir Square, where the largest protests were being held. For the first night of the curfew, the students had to be in their dorms from 6 p.m. until 8 a.m., but by the next day their curfew began at 4 p.m.
Lisa Anderson, the president of the American University in Cairo, came to speak to the students in the dorms to let them know they had the option of leaving the country on one of several flights chartered by the U.S. State Department. Clarke boarded a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, flew through Europe and finally reached his hometown of Sioux Falls, South Dakota Jan. 31.
Students also had the option to remain in Cairo and wait for any improvement in the situation, but the vast majority chose to leave the dorms.
Clarke decided leaving Egypt would be in his best interest because it was unclear whether the situation would improve. Unbeknownst to Clarke at the time, USC had issued a recommendation to evacuate the area as well.
“We didn’t have any cell phones or internet access, but I was able to talk to my parents on a landline through calling cards they had provided us with,” Clarke said. “I talked it over with them, and we all agreed it was the best thing for me to leave Cairo.”
Clarke said the Egyptian students who were attending orientation week were both concerned and hopeful about the demonstrations.
“Most of them were pretty anxious about what was going on,” Clarke said. “They were all definitely hoping that this would lead to a change in Egyptian politics, but I don’t think any of them expected Mubarak to resign from office. They just wanted a step toward democracy.”
Clarke said watching the events unfold before him added a new perspective to what he had learned about in classes he took at USC.
“I was enrolled in a course last semester that was about the politics of the Middle East,” he said. “We learned about the persistence of the authoritarianism in the region, so it was really interesting to see the people around us rise up on their own.”
Clarke now plans to take the rest of the spring semester off, and hopes to get a job in either Sioux Falls or in the Los Angeles area. Nevertheless, Clarke said that leaving Egypt was extremely bittersweet for him because he had so been looking forward to spending four months in Cairo.
“At the time it was kind of disappointing, but we were also just so hopeful that this would be bring about some kind of change for the people of Egypt,” Clarke said.

Following last week’s 5-2 victory against then-No. 20 Pepperdine, one thing became apparent: The team is dealing with injuries.
Freshman Michael Grant was out with a foot injury during practice and both freshman Ray Sarmiento and senior Peter Lucassen complained of pain during their matches.
“Staying healthy is the most important thing,” said senior Jaak Poldma. “We can’t have more players get hurt.”
The match against the Waves was by far the toughest this season for USC, and according to USC coach Peter Smith, a little wear and tear is to be expected.
“It’s all a part of it,” Smith said.
Injuries aside, the USC men’s tennis team rides a seven-match winning streak into Seattle this weekend, looking to defend its ITA National Team Indoor Championship title.
But the Trojans (7-0) will need all their players healthy if they hope to repeat as champions and extend their impressive start to the season.
To prepare for the tournament, Smith emphasized the importance of gaining momentum from the start and preparing for the specific style of indoor tennis.
“We’ve got to get quick points,” Smith said. “We need to work on coming in and facing guys. Indoor tennis is a lot faster than outdoor [because] you don’t have to deal with the elements.”
In last year’s competition, USC beat Yale 7-0 to take the crown, and junior Steve Johnson defeated the Bulldogs’ Marc Powers 7-6, 6-4 to claim the singles championship.
Junior Daniel Nguyen also had an impressive win at the No. 5 singles spot against Daniel Hoffman 6-2, 6-1 that would seal USC’s team victory.
So far this season, doubles play has been an undeniable sore spot, and the team knows that it must improve if it wants to continue its success.
“We need to focus on doubles,” Nguyen said. “We need to work on matches, drills, and work hard each day.”
Traveling to Seattle are: Johnson, Nguyen, Poldma, Sarmiento, freshman Emilio Gomez, sophomore J.T. Sundling and freshman Corey Smith. Lucassen will stay back in Los Angeles due to a foot injury.
Though USC is a favorite going into the tournament, it will not be easy to repeat. This will be a good test of endurance under extended play, especially for those among the roster who are younger and less experienced.
First up for USC is a match against No. 15 Duke today at 12 p.m.
In their matchup last March, the Blue Devils served the Trojans their second loss of the season. Besides Dylan Arnould, Duke is returning its entire roster that beat USC last season.

College students might not drink as much as is commonly believed, according to a report by Outside the Classroom, the organization that created AlcoholEdu.
Outside the Classroom created a survey polling approximately one-third of the total freshmen entering colleges and four-year universities since 2006. The results showed there has be an increase in the number of incoming freshmen who abstain from alcohol.
The number of students rose from 38 percent in 2006 to 62 percent in 2010.

USC freshmen are no exception to this growing trend. USC’s AlcoholEdu report shows that 53 percent of incoming freshmen in 2006 abstained from alcohol, while 61 percent of the 2010 freshman class identified themselves as abstainers before the start of the fall semester.
Brandon Busteed, CEO of Outside the Classroom, said this recent trend might have to do with the economic downturn. Busteed told USA Today the reason the percentage of teetotalers has increased is because students are taking their education more seriously to position themselves to compete in the job market and secure their financial futures.
“A lot of young adults realize that the quickest thing you can do to destroy a job interview is to go in all shiny and polished up, and then they check Facebook and there they are at a keg stand,” Busteed said.
Last year, an AlcoholEdu report found that 46 percent of students choose to abstain from alcohol because they don’t want to spend their money on buying it.
“Everything is going up,” said Joy Phan, a freshman majoring in music. “Meal plans and housing is going up, and there’s so many other things to spend money on as a student.”
Some freshmen at USC have noticed a change in the behavior of their friends, saying that students are more commonly choosing schoolwork over social events.
“My friends seem a lot more focused on doing well in school rather than partying or drinking,” said Naren Sahai, a freshman majoring in environmental engineering. “I think this has to do with doing better so that we can get better jobs and compete in this economy.”
Still, though 62 percent of this year’s incoming freshman class did not drink alcohol before coming to college, AlcoholEdu’s mid-semester survey reports that only 48 percent of students continue to classify themselves as abstainers.

AlcoholEdu has deemed this drop the “college effect,” and it occurs all around the country, according to Paula Swinford, director of Health Promotion and Prevention Services.
“Part of the culture of college is engaging in high-risk drinking,” Swinford said. “Part of the challenge is that there continues to be a huge marketing campaign to encourage consumption of alcohol.”
Despite the data on drinking rates, the Dept. of Public Safety has seen an increase in the number of alcohol-related cases it’s received since 2007.
In 2009, there were 107 transports, and DPS is expecting an even higher number this year.
Drinking leads to serious problems not just in college, but in the real world. Photo illustration by: Cory Sanford
Of particular concern to DPS Capt. David Carlisle is the number of medical transports.
“Last semester we had a concern about the number of students who had to be hospitalized because of toxic alcohol levels. The number was unusually high,” Carlisle said. “It’s difficult for me to tie alcohol consumption to the economy, looking at the number of alcohol related incidents.”
Badmouth- I’m sure you enjoyed living west of campus with your philosophy major friends. However, the rest of us enjoy partying with our rich friends, all of whom will be much more successful than you for no other reason than who we know.
off the point.. too much analysis or this is just a sign of uneducated-literate’s disease?
Unfounded assumptions: I am poor, I am philosophy major, I do not drink, I do not party, and I live on the west side of the campus.. Hell!!! you didn’t get any of them right? 
In my comments, I do not presume anything about financial status/class of the students. All I point out is the degenerate behavior in public places from excessive consumption of colorful libations…
Were you one of the rich shoplifters I saw the other day- b u t t hurt moron…
Rubbish. Drinking is what it it was, what it is, and always will be…most do it, few admit to how much. Another falsity of this weak report is that drinking will result in a person not getting a job, when in reality all studies indicate that the most successful of people frequent bars on a regular basis. This article is hog wash.
And the headline is poorly worded…
Regardless of what the alcohol-EDU survey revealed, drinking would not be down among “all” freshmen; there would fewer freshmen drinking, which means something entirely different. Just sayin…
“Self-reporting” =/= honesty. Human nature is that, people have a tendency to downplay any negative attributes about themselves. You’re only fooling yourself. 
These “self reported” polls are useless; the number of freshmen who drink is higher than what polls reveal.
Important statistic to note: halfway through first semester freshmen abstinence rate had dropped from from 62% to 48%. This is evidence for the significant pressure to drink at USC, whether social or stress-related.
I knew USC was getting soft
Interesting that the numbers began declining after 2006, the year I graduated.
weird
Problem is more deeply rooted than the article paints it to be.. try eating at the joints by the row on weekends.. drunken shoplifters sneaking free kettle baked chips, wasted students thrash talking to the homeless, and off course the gropers and cockfighters.. Once I had to call the DPS when a bunch of drunken retards were taking on a guy… No wonder DPS and LAPD patrol the area like vultures..

USC University Hospital released a statement Thursday announcing that it had placed a temporary hold on its kidney transplant program as the result of a “process error.”
The hospital was not free to comment on the nature of the error, but a spokesman for OneLegacy, a program that coordinates organ transplants in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times that a kidney was accidentally transplanted into the wrong patient when two organs from separate donors arrived at the hospital around the same time Jan. 29.
The hospital said “as patient safety is the hospital’s number one concern, the hospital inactivated the program while clinical protocols are assessed and additional safeguards to the kidney transplant program are developed.”
Bryan Stewart, the spokesman for OneLegacy, told the Times the wrongly transplanted kidney was a close enough match to avoid harm for the patient who received it.
“Our packaging and documentation was accurate,” Chief Executive of OneLegacy Thomas Mone told the Times.
He said the mistake was likely the result of “human error” at the hospital.
The hospital voluntarily conducted a review of the kidney transplant program at its own expense, which included “validation of a corrective action plan by a kidney transplant surgeon and transplant administrator from other transplant centers” in addition to staff from the United Network for Organ Sharing Department of Quality, according to the official statement.
According to the hospital, the internal review could be completed as soon as today, at which point hospital administrators will consider resuming transplants because of the high demand for organs.
The hospital notified UNOS, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services program that organizes the distribution of organs for transplant, of the incident Feb. 4.
The UNOS review will require the hospital to submit a corrective action plan to be approved by the agency to ensure the mistake is not repeated.
A spokesman for the California Department of Public Health told the Times that the licensing agency is also investigating the incident at the hospital. The department is in charge of licensing hospitals in California as well as responding to complaints and reporting incidents regarding those hospitals.
The kidney transplant program at the USC University Hospital has performed more than 250 transplants since its first operation in 1991. The program has a 92 percent patient survival rate and 87 percent graft survival rate at three years post-transplant.
I’m soon going in for open heart surgery at the USC Hospital. And I’m hoping the dedicated doctors and staff at USC don’t remove my only kidney instead. Folks ya’ gotta pay attention to what you’re doing!
Hopefully it’ll start back up soon. A friend of mine is scheduled for a transplant there this week.

2010 was a curiously strong year for music, yet few acts enchanted the indie circuit like Beach House. Comprised solely of Baltimore natives Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally, the dream pop duo released their third album, Teen Dream, to bubbling critical and commercial acclaim.         
Lusher than the band’s previous outings and filled with icy, melodic murmurings worthy of Brian Wilson or Neil Young, the album signalled a new aural height for Beach House, but also a new challenge — creating a live show worthy of Teen Dream’s haunting power.
On Wednesday night, Legrand and Scally delivered just that to a sold out crowd at The Music Box in the first of two final Los Angeles concerts before the duo returns to the studio.
San Francisco lo-fi outfit Papercuts opened the show with a labored set that seemed to borrow sonic influences from Beach House, particularly some occasionally shimmering guitar work from front man Jason Robert Quever. Sadly, what Papercuts packed in effect pedals, its five members sorely lacked in song structure and urgency. The set concluded to polite applause, with few hoots and hollers.
Just after 10 p.m., the curtains rose to reveal Beach House’s minimal gear setup against some of the most simplistically gorgeous stage decorations to have come through the Los Angeles concert scene recently. Three paper pyramids were erected behind the instruments, one for each band member. After a few excited moments, Legrand and Scally emerged with their tour drummer to tumultuous applause.
Dressed in a seafoam green blazer with her long curly hair characteristically disheveled and wild, Legrand wordlessly exuded a genuine, brazen sensuality not often found in American musicians. As the band drove into the quivering intro of “Gila,” both Legrand and Scally, sitting with his Stratocaster, bobbed and swayed as though suspended in a liquid. The crowd followed suit, surrendering itself willingly to the beautiful sounds bleeding from the amps.
The band’s early numbers benefited from an unusually rich sound setup. Each instrument rang with clarity, from Legrand’s electric organ to Scally’s reverberated guitar tones. Even the live drums added a kick to Better Times and Walk In The Park, both of which were recorded using synthetic percussion. The paper pyramids also did their job effectively, illuminated by different shades of color for each song, lending the show an air of elegance.
“This is our first show in LA since 2008 that’s been our show,” Scally said to the audience, thanking people for coming before commenting on the smell of incense in the venue.
Surprisingly, the set’s already solid beginning turned out to be a prelude for the visual power of a later number. As the reedy organ, guitar chimes and crashing drums of Norway rang out, the lights suddenly darkened and an entire wall of twinkling stars appeared behind the band, the pyramids glowing a ghostly blue. The crowd went wild for the moment, which instantly recalled the endless nights of Hammerfest as well as the magical realist dreamscapes of Petersen’s The NeverEnding Story.
The performance and visual realization of “Norway” were so astronomically sensual that LeGrand and Scally had difficulty topping them for the remainder of the show. Still, the two maintained their rhythmic energy and precision admirably.
The stage set also changed occasionally, with intense jets of fog during Silver Soul and Lover of Mine leading Legrand to scoff, “We’re a smoke-friendly band.”
Some surprises came near the show’s finish, beginning with a lovely rendition of the band’s earlier, rarely-played “Astronaut.” Here, the stars returned, now under lusty red lights, their former brilliance turned to something more human and desirous.”
Also played was a new song called Frightened Eyes,with heavy layers of guitar feedback and distorted organ, even synth-like sounds, but with the same melodic pulse found on Teen Dream. If the song is any indication of what Beach House might be up to after the tour, fans will be in for quite the jolt on the band’s next album.
In a rare moment of error, Scally missed the guitar entrance at the beginning of Used to Be, causing the band to begin the song again, laughing it off. It was a brief display of self-deprecating warmth from the otherwise mysterious, coldly elegant band and the affection stuck right through the final verses of “Take Care,” the concluding song of the initial set.
Upon returning to the stage for an encore, Legrand gave profound thanks to the crowd and bade all a “sweet dream.” The band’s final number, the majestically melancholic 10 Mile Stereo sent fans and converts off into the night, silent and squinting in the obnoxious glare of Hollywood lights.

Bacon. Oh, the crispy, salty delight that neighbors our yummy pancakes and eggs on a breakfast plate. In many instances, this is one of the few times one will see bacon in a meal, other than on say, a BLT sandwich. But what about bacon as a dessert?
Bacon bits · Nickel Diner’s creative recipes take the ordinary donut to greater heights. The maple-glazed bacon donut and the strawberry crunch are only a couple of examples of the diner’s mouthwatering concoctions. - Cory Sanford | Daily Trojan 
At Nickel Diner in downtown Los Angeles, those dreams, in the form of a maple-glazed bacon donut, come true.
At first, the thought of smoky applewood bacon on a donut sounds, well, downright gross. But this type of culinary inventiveness deserves some sort of praise or at least some attention. Who doesn’t love that moment when the sweet maple syrup from a plate of fluffy buttermilk pancakes accidentally, or not so accidentally, ends up on a crispy wave of bacon?
The hybrid taste is sensational, and Nickel Diner’s concept, genius.
Walking into the small diner, located on Main Street in downtown’s Old Bank District, the establishment is beaming with life and the sweet, homey smells of its delicious fare.
Reminiscent of a 1950s diner with a modern typography twist, this place is unlike any of its competitors, and certainly nothing like Denny’s. The food stands on its own as a notable culinary experience, but it is Nickel Diner’s dessert menu that really draws in a crowd.
Just a stone’s throw away from the Fashion District, the charming eatery summons a blend of patrons, a melting pot of curious first-timers, employees on lunch break and L.A. hipsters with one thing on their mind: bacon.
There are many versions of the bacon donut surfacing around the country, but this ever-expanding trend is an intriguing breakthrough from a cupcake-crazed Los Angeles. The simple yet enticing treat is a composition of a plain donut, generously sprinkled with crunchy bacon bits and finally veiled with a silky sweet maple glaze.
At first bite, the contemplation sets in. Does this donut really live up to the hype? The answer is yes.
The unparalleled combination of the candy-like glaze and salty meat proves to be a satisfying surprise, paying tribute to breakfast and dessert alike. The only problem? It doesn’t last long.
Fortunately, Nickel Diner offers an array of other donuts that lend a hand in satisfying a sweet craving. Showcased on the shirts of friendly employees, donuts like strawberry crunch, topped with a crispy strawberry crumble, red velvet, filled with cream cheese icing, and Nutella, a chocolate donut sprinkled with hazelnuts, push the limits far beyond the typical Winchell’s donut.
Open from Tuesday to Sunday, this spot is sure to fill your empty stomach at all hours of the day, for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
“This is the place. There is no place quite like this place anywhere near this place so this must be the place,” is seen on the wall of the restaurant as customers leave.
Since there is no place quite like this one, it deserves a second look.
Nickel Diner is located on 524 South  Main St., Los Angeles, Calif.,  90012.

Last week, Current TV did something new, not just for itself, but for the medium as a whole.
It debuted Bar Karma, a weekly science fiction show, developed by Sims creator Will Wright, where audience members submit story ideas online, and the production team turns those ideas into episodes.
The show’s production format is unique. Yes, the production team provides the raw materials (actors, crew, etc.), but it’s the show’s audience that drives the show’s plot. In fact, the creators refer to it as “community-developed television”
Current TV is relatively new, less than a decade old. It has a few in-house shows, but the focus is on viewer-created content.
Viewers film their own material and submit it, which is then aired and commented on by the audience.
Bar Karma and Current also point to the growing trend of interactive media.
The last decade has seen a massive empowering of communication, as people have found new ways to voice their opinions.
The rise of Web 2.0, characterized in part by networking and greater participation, made Internet interaction even more of a two-way path.
So what makes media interactive?
In some cases, like Bar Karma, it’s literally having the audience craft the stories for the series.
In other cases, crowdsourcing, turning to an outside group for feedback, is also used.
Or it could be sites like Wikipedia, where anyone is able to contribute and the goal is to create a collective organization working for free-for-the-masses information.
The main idea in interactive media is that the audience has a voice, whether through in-house comments or produced responses to the media.
But the change shows more than a tech-based change, it shows a cultural one.
Yes, technology has changed the game, but it’s only been the facilitator for communication.
The interactions formed by this communication has let people find others of similar interests and allowed them to team up and produce their own media.
Take for example blogs, web series, wikis, website commenting, zines, student films and other non-studio media.
These are all usually created by individuals, not conglomerates or movers and shakers. The people themselves are becoming the movers and shakers.
This growth stems from a couple of different cultural movements.
It grew out of early computing, where people found themselves at the forefront of innovation.
Because the field was so new, there were no experts or precedents, and anyone could come up with something new.
It was this anything-goes approach that spurred the social media of today, which is one of the many facets of interactive media.
It also came out of the DIY-subculture that started in the 1970s and really boomed in the 1990s.
People want to create content, and now, thanks to new technology, closer connections and a willingness to hear other opinions, they can.
And now it’s creeping up on the mainstream entertainment scene.
Aside from reality shows having audience members vote in to decide winners, many shows offer online polls, have message forums for viewer feedback and web series like the upcoming LoveMakers have video games, tips for fans and planned parties featuring the actors in character.
The question then is clear: Will these shows be the future of media?
More than likely, no. There are some people who are skilled not only at coming up with ideas, but also at working with studios, and these people will continue to dominate the media production world.
So online media, fan feedback and other forms of interactive media will stay on the backburner, no matter how empowered people become in sharing their views.
But it will continue to grow, and through that, things will slowly change. There will be a large subculture right beneath the surface for people to use.
People are active in the entertainment world in ways they have never been before.
Industry outsiders now have a voice, and people are listening.
If anything, it’s time for people to start submitting story ideas for a Bar Karma episode.

Unknown has all the makings of a summer blockbuster: big name stars, a fast paced plot, smart dialogue and explosions.
Hidden under the glamorous sheen are truly compelling characters. But the story itself, adapted from French novelist Didier van Cauwelaert’s Hors de moi, ends up feeling contrived.
The film begins with American botanist Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arriving with his wife, Elizabeth (January Jones), at a Berlin hotel for a biotechnology conference. He realizes that his briefcase was left behind at the airport, so they grab a taxi to rush back and get it. En route, they get into a horrible, watery accident and Martin is saved by the cab driver, Gina (Diane Kruger). Four days later he wakes up in the hospital, confused, alone and without any identification.
Things get worse for Martin when he finds Liz back at the hotel with another man (Aidan Quinn) claiming to be the real Martin Harris. This new guy has the right stuff to prove his case, whipping out several forms of ID and some honeymoon photos for good measure.
Martin takes to the snowy streets of Berlin to rummage through his identity crisis, meeting several odd characters along the way. Every person, word choice and expression instantly becomes suspicious. One can never tell the difference between who is trying to help Martin and who is trying to kill him.
Unknown is laced with stellar acting. Neeson instantly makes his character likable, playing him with just enough guile and existential angst to elicit genuine concern from the audience. This is quite a feat, considering the limited details about who Martin actually is.
It is equally remarkable that in a film with a rough and tough mentality, Neeson can still make Martin vulnerable. He is first and foremost a name-taking badass, but he is also a man hurt and displaced by his wife’s rejection.
The friendship Martin develops with Gina is one of the most interesting aspects of the film, and also the least complicated.
Her bohemian lifestyle forces him to approach the situation from a fresh point of view, and his conventional intelligence helps her deal with problems of her own. Though their spark is strictly platonic, these two seem to make more sense as a pair than Martin and Liz.
Yet Jones’ signature iciness makes Liz more frightening than anything else. Calculating and devoid of emotion, Liz’s true motives are always elusive. Unfortunately, her character remains undeveloped, which lessens the punch of the film’s climax.
Unknown almost loses its focus with many attempts at masquerading as an action flick. There are several unnecessarily extravagant fight scenes and car chases sprinkled throughout, which do not add anything useful to the story. The film is much better at wrestling with the suspenseful and mysterious layers of the plot.
Still, the gloomy cinematography and nerve-wracking timing do an excellent job at providing the audience with a feeling of uneasiness during the course of the film. In each of the few slow-moving scenes, there is so much tension that one anticipates something awful will happen at any moment.
The twists and turns of Unknown become more complex as the story progresses. It takes considerable effort to keep up and the audience is pulled in several different directions.
Countless new characters and plot lines are thrown into the mix at inopportune times, cleverly detracting from the answers to the film’s major questions.
Despite the seemingly unnecessary complications, the film’s tactic for keeping the ending under wraps proves effective. The final revelation of exactly what is going on is utterly surprising.
Unknown explores the meaning of identity and memory, perhaps not as well as films from a similar vein such as The Bourne Identity series.
It’s an entertaining journey but the film’s impact could have been more meaningful with stronger character development or emphasis on psychological thrill, rather than fancy action sequences.
Nevertheless, the film addresses an interesting issue that anyone can struggle with: What determines who you are? There is no easy answer, and Unknown serves as a reminder of just that.

Mark Cuban said in December that he was interested in funding the creation of a playoff system in college football.
Now he’s taken the first step in creating a true national championship by forming a limited liability company called Radical Football.
The company was created “to impact college football so that the last two teams playing are the best two teams,” Cuban said in an e-mail.
Along with Cuban, Scott Morris, a Los Angeles-based digital media consultant is closely working with him.
Last weekend, Morris was in San Diego representing Radical Football as a judge in a competition among college business students who pitched their plans to change the college football postseason.
To change or replace this system, the Cuban has suggested persuading college presidents by using financial incentives.
The billionaire entrepreneur said that he planned to contact school presidents and other power brokers to move the effort forward as well.
More recently, Cuban has also pondered the idea of having a mid-season playoff lead to a final championship game.
The college presidents and chancellors who oversee college football, however, oppose changing this system because they said it could undermine several significant parts of the game, including the regular season, the traditions and the revenues of the bowl system.
Currently, the major college football system comprises 35 bowl games and no playoff, while voters and computer formulas determine the top two teams to meet in a final Bowl Championship Series game.

This week, I have received four e-mails sent over class listservs asking me to vote for certain candidates for Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
My gut reaction to these e-mails was disapproval. Course e-mail groups are meant for academic communications, I reasoned, and were therefore inappropriate places to advertise for USG candidates.
Furthermore, as the e-mails were sent out by the candidates’ friends, the candidates’ ability to reach voters via this medium depended more on their popularity — or at least the size of their social networks — than on their qualifications to lead.
It seems inherently unfair that some candidates could take advantage of this form of free advertising while others’ campaign slogans never even reached my inbox.
Upon further consideration, however, I realized the folly of my initial response.
Every USC student knows that although course e-mail lists are intended for communication about the class, they are often used for other reasons. Nobody likes being invited to take a survey by one of last year’s classmates, but in college, such invitations are a fact of life.
Although the candidates’ ability to take advantage of the e-mail lists can certainly vary, this is really no different than any other form of promotion.
Friends handing out flyers on Trousdale, posters and billboards around campus, and most of all, word of mouth — aspiring USG leaders’ ability to take advantage of any of these is determined first and foremost by the number of peers they have who are ready to take up their cause.
There were some genuinely positive aspects of the e-mails I received. Before reading them, I had no idea what any of the candidates’ positions were. Now I know about proposals to increase off-campus transportation or extend the Campus Center’s hours. Were it not for the friends’ outreach efforts, I would have been an uninformed voter.
These realizations translate into important lessons that can carry over to national, state and local elections.
There are serious problems with the way campaigns are run today in the United States. Campaign finance at best distorts political priorities and at worst serves as a vehicle for today’s equivalent of old-school, machine-style corruption.
The prominence of short television advertisements forces candidates to run on a platform of sound bites, and ultimately leads to dirty electioneering and smear campaigning. The 24-hour news cycle only exacerbates these problems.
I have previously written about the negative impacts these campaigning  features have on politics and policy in America. They give too much influence to leaders from the fringe left and right, create a political climate based on personality instead of ideas and make it difficult for politicians to espouse the kind of complex thoughts necessary to tackle today’s increasingly complicated problems.
Just as with the USG elections, however, these corrupting influences can also be viewed as necessary evils in the process of informing a massive electorate eager to cast a vote but short on independent sources from which to learn about the candidates.
The growth of democracy is one of the notably great trends of American history.
Although it has led to a more unwieldy political process and sometimes diluted the quality of public discourse, the positive aspects of popularization and democratization — both moral and practical — far outweigh these negative impacts.
The 2012 Presidential campaign is already under way, especially the ongoing jockeying for the Republican nomination.
There are sure to be innumerable controversies that will be rehashed in 30-second spots which will undoubtedly not do the issues justice. More outrage will be directed toward these “dirty” campaign techniques.
We would be well served at those times to remember the lessons of the USG e-mails.
There might be downsides to the election tactics that have developed over the years, but that is the flip side of the coin of democracy that we cherish so much.

Los Angeles is a city without a face, lacking a symbol.
Now, a movement is crystallizing to bring a major NFL team to the heart of Los Angeles to inhabit a stadium on the current site of the L.A. Convention Center. It was even announced that the naming rights had already been sold, christening the stadium Farmers Field,  for Farmers Insurance.
Perhaps our city’s famous college crosstown rivalry is far more interesting than any pro team ever could be, but this city, with its vitality and diversity, could be united under allegiance to an NFL team. The way this stadium is materializing, however, as a corporate venture from the Anschutz Entertainment Group, the entertainment conglomerate behind L.A. Live, does not appear to promise such unity.
There’s no soul to L.A. Live, with its imitation Citywalk shopping area and little to do that justifies the exorbitant local parking fees. This is the status quo for Los Angeles. L.A.’s city government seems disinterested in overseeing the in-depth planning of development projects. As a result, L.A. Live and other similar development projects lack a connection to the city.
AEG’s plans could have a massive and poorly-understood effect on a community that already has three major sports teams in a highly condensed area. Would the new transit line make up for the increase in traffic on the 110? Will neighboring communities suffer any environmental harm? AEG seems unconcerned, and is even lobbying the city government and state assembly to exempt it from environmental regulations so it can build the stadium in time for the 2015 Superbowl.
I don’t blame AEG for its apparent disregard for the Los Angeles community, seeing as they don’t have any constituents to appease.
Ultimately, the hubbub over this proposed stadium might be the product of wishful thinking for a sports-starved L.A. still bitter from its abandonment by the Rams and Raiders. But the proposed Farmers Field stands as evidence of a larger cultural divide in our city. Development is handled by a privileged few who have little investment in the long-term economic growth of a community, and the result is a disconnected and faceless city lacking in identity.
City and state officials need to look beyond short-term concerns and plot a vision of a new Los Angeles for the 21st century.
Farmers Field is not that vision.

Lady Danville has the perfect success story for the modern college band.
In 2006, students Daniel Chang and Michael Garner collaborated to make indie pop music together after meeting in UCLA’s a capella group Awaken. They wrote a hit song called “Cast Away” which took the gold in UCLA’s Spring Sing talent competition, a competition Sara Bareilles, Tyrone Wells and Maroon 5 once won.
With only Chang on guitar and Garner on keyboards, their sound wasn’t complete. In 2007, they sought out fellow a capella member Matthew Frankel to join in on their project to play the cajon. Soon enough, the singing trio captured the hearts of their fellow classmates and went on to bigger venues, from the El Rey and Hotel Café to The Troubadour and the Viper Room.
Without releasing a record yet, the band’s music has already made quite an impact on Los Angeles’ college music scene. Just finishing their tour with Ben Folds and their leg of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, Lady Danville has much to look forward to in its future.
Their catchy upbeat tunes supported by harmonies only a capella men could pull off and instruments catered to acoustic sets provide for not only a unique sound but a very intimate concert experience.
My Top Picks: “Cars,” “Bed 42,” “Frames and Moulding,” and “Tired Magician.”
