The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, Sept. 22, and Tuesday, Sept. 23. 
 
Crimes against property
at 11:10 A.M. on Sept. 22, two trailers became detached while being pulled by a University cart driven by a staff member. The trailers rolled into a non-USC male’s vehicle and caused minor damage to the vehicle.
at 8:09 p.m. on Sept. 22, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect driving a vehicle near entrance gate 5. The vehicle was identified as stolen by the license plate recognition system. The officers located the vehicle and the suspect was detained during a felony stop conducted by LAPD officers. The suspect was determined to be the girlfriend of the vehicle’s owner and he had mistakenly reported the vehicle stolen because he did not know she had it.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 8:22 A.M. on Sept. 22, a faculty member reported receiving an envelope in the mail that contained two bullet casings at the Albert S. Raubenheimer Music Memorial Building.
at 8:32 P.M. on Sept. 22,  a student reported that someone entered her possibly unlocked dorm room at Elisabeth Von Kleinsmid Memorial Residence Hall,  and rearranged her personal property. No property was removed and the student concluded that the incident might have been a prank.
at 9:05 P.M. on Sept. 22, at Regal Trojan, a student reported that he donated to a suspect who came to his door collecting money for a charity, but the student now believes the charity is a fraud.

Women’s Student Assembly hosted Master of Professional Writing program professor and author Janet Fitch on Wednesday night at the University Religious Center.
Women’s Student Assembly is one of the nine assemblies of the Undergraduate Student Government Program Board.
“WSA is a space to be myself, but also explore what it means to be who I am, because there are so many cultural messages about the way women should be,” said Chelsee Bergen, a board member of WSA.  “It’s a space that I can process and build a community around people who are also interested in expressing themselves.”
Wednesday’s event was the first time the WSA has hosted an author.
Fitch studied history at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. She won a student exchange program to Keele University in England where she decided on her 21st birthday that she wanted to write fiction.
At the event, Fitch talked about and read passages from her novels, including a passage from her novel, White Oleander, which was featured on Oprah’s Book Club. Fitch described the 1999 novel, which was later turned into a movie, as a savage love story between a mother and a daughter. The novel is about a 12-year-old girl who must navigate the Los Angeles foster care system after her mother is convicted of killing her own boyfriend. Fitch said that the book was intended to be a coming-of-age story.
“All stories are coming-of-age stories because you never really get there — finding the truth of life,” Fitch said. “You are always a beginner, always figuring out what sits well and what doesn’t sit well.”
The novel’s protagonist moves from foster home to foster home and is told by different mothers how to live. Each of the houses she lives in is its own little world with its own truths and values. Ultimately, it becomes the protagonist’s responsibility to find out what she wants to believe and live by.
“Looking at my own story, with every older woman who was interesting to me, I’d take a little something from,” Fitch said. “It’s like your own mother isn’t your only mother. They all give you examples of how you want to live.”
Fitch interviewed girls in the foster care system who told her that the experience is like constantly auditioning for a part. According to Fitch, there is a relationship between this “auditioning” and the ways in which Americans live. Fitch believes that people aren’t given who they are; rather, they try different characteristics in developing their personalities.
Fitch said that the idea for White Oleander came to her gradually.
“It’s like you follow a little stream and you find another little stream that joins it and you follow a little further and something else joins it,” Fitch said of how she got the idea for White Oleander. “You start with a tiny little thing and other things that interest you join up. Then you have all these strands coming together.”
She described her participation in a writer’s group as helpful to her creative process.
“I was in a writer’s group where you picked a random word, usually very simple,” Fitch said. “And then you let that inspire you. You pick one idea and write two pages double-spaced. The word was ‘wind’ with White Oleander. I saw a full moon and a woman with white blonde hair on the roof of a building, and I wrote two pages double-spaced. It just started growing.”
Students said it was interesting to get an inside look from an author’s perspective.
“It was incredible because you read all the workings of her imagination without ever actually thinking about who wrote this, but you get to know these characters so personally and you feel so involved with them,” said Ashley Lukashevsky, a senior majoring in international relations and a fan of White Oleander. “So seeing her and meeting her and being able to speak with her about her thought process and inspirations — it’s an experience we are so lucky to have.”
Fitch is currently in the process of finishing a historical novel about three schoolgirls during the Russian Revolution.
“I’m interested in what it’s like to live in the repercussions of historical decisions,” Fitch said.

On Wednesday afternoon, the USC Viterbi School of Engineering held a memorial service for late professor Oliver Franke at the Caruso Catholic Center.
In memoriam · Deacon Paul Pesqueira leads a memorial service for late Viterbi professor Oliver Franke at the Caruso Catholic Center. – Carol Kim | Daily Trojan
Family, friends, colleagues and dozens of Franke’s students gathered at the Our Savior Parish in the USC Catholic Center to honor his memory. Attendees filled the room and many stood in in the back for the duration of the memorial after all the seats were filled.
Close members of Franke’s family, including his wife, Professor Andrea Hodge, and Professor Michael Kassner, a close friend and colleague, spoke at the memorial.
Hodge described him as a loving, generous and very thoughtful husband. She advised the crowd, most of them students, not to settle for anything less than true love.
Professor Franke completed his doctoral studies in materials science at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany. He has lectured at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and researched at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and he began lecturing at Viterbi during the fall semester of 2010.
Franke passed away of a heart attack early Thursday morning at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was 35.
Assistant Professor Veronica Eliasson was a colleague of the couple in the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. She described how after Franke’s trips overseas, he would always bring back special gifts for friends and family.
“I think it says a lot about his personality that he was very observant and used the information to make everybody happy,” Eliasson said.
She went on to mention that Franke was not a particularly talkative man, but when he said something, it was always of importance.
“He never complained or said anything negative — he would only contribute thoughts on how to make the department better,” she said.
Viterbi Ph.D. candidate Roe Burrell served as Franke’s teaching assistant in the past. Burrell admitted he felt intimidated and impressed by Franke’s resume in the beginning, but the intimidation quickly vanished.
“He was immediately friendly, light-hearted and honest,” he said. He recalled his reaction to the sad news last Thursday morning.
“We were all in shock because he was so young — It was out of the blue. It went from speaking with him Tuesday to him passing away on Thursday with no indication that anything was wrong,” Burrell said.
Rayed Khan, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering and a former student of Franke’s, described him as a professor and friend that was always willing to offer advice.
“Meeting him raised the expectations I have for myself and the work I do,” Khan said. “While it is extremely difficult to see a man with so much potential pass away suddenly, it reminds us to constantly strive for excellence, just as Professor Franke would have wanted.”
Oliver Franke’s ashes will be taken to Germany to rest.
“After we are all done with being sad, he’s the kind of guy that will make us smile,” Eliasson said. “We just have to give him a little time.”
 
Thanks for this article about Oliver. We will miss him tremendously.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics continued its Students Talk Back series on Wednesday with a panel entitled, “ISIS, Syria and Iraq: The Obama Administration’s Response.” The panel featured Robert C. O’Brien, U.S. Representative to the 60th Session of the United Nations General Assembly; Unruh Institute director Dan Schnur; Raymond Nhan, a member of USC College Republicans and a student at the USC Gould School of Law and Shikhar Gupta, Vice President of USC College Democrats.
O’Brien opened the panel with background on ISIS as an organization and their presence in the Middle East.
“ISIS controls a large swath of land in Iraq and Syria … [T]hey’re basically becoming the main franchise for the Islamic extremist caliphate,” O’Brien said.
ISIS’s appeal to extreme fundamentalists has put them in direct conflict with another Islamist terror cell: Al Qaeda.
“With ISIS’s declaration of a new caliphate, al Qaeda is losing their traditional base … [T]heir interests don’t align,” Gupta said.
The conflict of interest between the two groups indicates that U.S. intervention combatting one cell could potentially help the other, putting the United States in an uncomfortable situation.
When discussing the White House response to the ISIS issue, Schnur commented on the President’s original hesitancy to intervene.
“What’s most interesting to me is watching President Obama in this situation … [H]e came under a lot of criticism early on for what had been seen as a hesitation on his part,” Schnur said.
He attributed some of this to Obama’s personal beliefs.
“The greater part of his political identity for over a decade has been as an opponent of U.S. military intervention where he does not see it fit … for years he has been the guy who was going to end the war,” Schnur said.
O’Brien suggested that the newly-announced airstrikes could have negative implications for the Obama administration.
“This president is one who took great pride in the fact that he won the war in Iraq, and now we’re back in Iraq … [N]ot only does he lose the legacy of withdrawing from Iraq, but fairly or unfairly he will receive criticism for the operations with ISIS … [I]t’s going to be very, very tough for the White House,” O’Brien said.
The panel then moved to a discussion of ISIS’s blatant human rights abuses, such as the recent beheading of American journalist James Foley in Syria.
“They’ve been extremely brutal,” O’Brien said. “What’s particularly disturbing is their use of rape as a genocide. We thought we got rid of that in Bosnia, but it’s back in a big way.”
Human rights issues have garnered international attention and rising concerns for the situation in the region.
“The aspect that really got a lot of coverage in our media was the graphic human rights violations … [Y]ou saw folks fleeing and [being] forced to convert or murdered. You saw people in Syria being crucified,” Nhan said.
The desire to cease human rights abuses was prevalent throughout the whole panel and during the Q&A portion.
“I can think of a couple of things, but the first one is the human rights aspect,” Nhan said in response to the question of why the United States is attacking ISIS.
“There is no situation in history where we look back and regret stepping in in light of a human rights issue, but there are many instances where we look back and regret not doing more,” Nhan said.

Undergraduate Student Government President Andrew Menard and Vice President Rini Sampath hosted USG’s first SpeakSC open discussion at the Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday night. SpeakSC is intended as a space for students to air their grievances to the USG, and to have their questions answered.
Transparency · USG Vice President Rini Sampath and President Andrew Menard hope to reach out to students this year through the monthly SpeakSC discussions. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
 
William Chen, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting, was excited to have the opportunity to raise his concerns with USG.
“It’s really awesome that they’re making an effort to really create an opportunity for dialogue, and that’s what student government is here to do — to bridge that gap between administrators and us,” he said. “There are a lot of issues that USG and the [administrators] may not even know about and this is a great platform to do that.”
USG’s mission this year is to make what they do more transparent to the student body so that students can give input for what they want to see on campus.
Sampath said the motivation to organize SpeakSC was because there weren’t enough opportunities for students to voice their opinions and ask for changes in a way that would reach the administration.
“Students don’t have a face to a name, and they don’t know who to talk to,” Sampath said. “We want to give students as many opportunities as possible to voice those concerns and act as a liaison between the senate and administration to implement the changes that students want on campus.”
In response to concerns about student safety, Menard stated that DPS takes safety walks once a semester to take notes on what areas were deemed unsafe, and that USG would take steps to address these issues with DPS.
“Sometime over this semester, we will have DPS officers come to this event, and we hope to put the concerns of students directly to them, and help figure out some solutions,” he said.
Other topics of discussion included student issues with the Engemann Health Center being slow about responding to students and concerns that the fingerprinting and guest pass system in residential buildings on campus was inefficient. Students also said there was a lack of affordable food options nearby since the closing of the University Village for construction.
Sampath assured the attendees that both she and Menard were going to bring up these issues with the administration.
“USC Hospitality is working to get food trucks on campus on the weekends to address the concerns about food on weekends,” she said. “We definitely want to work out some more affordable food on campus.”
Some students were satisfied with the initiative that could help them be part of the changes they wanted at USC.
Maya Carter, a sophomore majoring in international relations, stated that she believes that there is a lot of action being put behind the words.
“I know it’s really hard to get these things done with the administration, but at the end of the day, they are putting in the work and that’s all students really need to hear,” she said. “Hopefully we can get more people to come.”
Alexis Cotton, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, was unsure if a forum was the best way to have students voice their concerns.
“I think it is helpful, but I know that just because of the time it happened students couldn’t attend this, or felt the need to attend this,” she said. “Maybe they need to create, like, an online forum which would be easier because people are always on social media and always on their phones.”
Menard and Sampath hope to make SpeakSC a monthly event where they can constantly update students on issue resolution and open the forum to any more concerns that students may have.

While this week didn’t produce any albums that truly shined, which can be attributed to pushed-back release dates as opposed to lack of talent, there is plenty of notable music to review.
Sophisticated Lady · Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett put out an album of old jazz standards by composers such as Gershwin, Porter and Berlin. Cheek to Cheek features such classic numbers as “Anything Goes,” “It Don’t mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing),” and “Cheek to Cheek.” – Courtesy of New York Daily News
Starting off with releases last week, Big Sean and Lady Gaga (with swinger legend Tony Bennett) both made news for separate but equally relevant projects. Big Sean last week signed with Roc Nation, Jay-Z’s recording company, and then released four powerful tracks with production credits ranging from Mike WiLL Made-It to Kanye West.
The four tracks are just a taste of what Big Sean has in store and are sure to blow up in the coming weeks. Most notably, the Kanye West and DJ Mustard-produced track entitled “I Don’t F-ck With You” showcases both the production team’s talents in blending old classics into new hits (a Kanye West trademark) and Big Sean’s strong handle over his lyricism. Though there is no official release date for any Big Sean album on the horizon, rest assured whenever the young Detroit artist does release something, it will be a highlight of the year.
Lady Gaga made news this week by releasing Cheek to Cheek with the legendary Tony Bennett, a crooner with 17 Grammys and multiple platinum albums under his belt. Although the album is all covers, it is a departure from Lady Gaga’s usual style and is a refreshing take on some classics that have been adored by generations. Featuring tracks originally written by artists such as Duke Ellington (“It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)” and “Sophisticated Lady”), the collaboration is a light, warm-hearted homage to a previous era in popular music. Gaga sounds almost unrecognizable from her usual efforts as she strips away the bells and whistles to showcase her amazing vocal talent, and Bennett is a star as always, making this album a must-listen.
There are more big releases coming this fall, with new material from The Game, SBTRKT, Steve Aoki and Weezer all set to drop in the next month, and since there are singles from each of these albums already out.
First off, veteran rapper The Game has a new album, Blood Moon: Year Of The Wolf coming out in October that he has promised “will be another #1 album” according to a press release.
Originally titled Blood Money La Familia, the album has features from Tyga, Ty Dolla $ign, 2 Chainz, Soulja Boy and T.I. to name just a few, and the tracks that have already been released, “Or Nah” (not to be confused with the Ty Dolla $ign track of the same name) and “Bigger Than Me” are enough to put this album on every watchlist until its release.
SUBTRKT, an experimental U.K. artist who made waves with his self titled first album in 2011, has a new one dropping on October 7, entitled Wonder Where We Land. Six tracks out of 15 have already been released, and the sophomore effort is already impressive. SBTRKT has an interesting group of collaborators, notably Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend and A$AP Ferg. The tracks with these two artists, “New Dorp. New York” and “Voices In My Head” have already been released, and both showcase the experimental talent that made SBTRKT popular. “Voices In My Head” features a verse by A$AP Ferg that has almost no backing track at all, and the minimal perspective makes Ferg’s rap all the more impressive. Overall, this album is another one to watch out for, as Wonder Where We Land will be nothing if not original.
The next on the list is Steve Aoki, and the electronic artist is coming on strong with a two-part album, Neon Futures I & II, that features a slew of artists from all across the music spectrum. This might be the only album that features Machine Gun Kelly, Will.i.Am and Fall Out Boy, and it is a must-listen for that reason alone. On top of that, “Delirious (Boneless),” the main single off the album, peaked at number 9 on Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic chart, giving this album a boost right out of the gate. Hopefully, the rest of the tracks on Neon Futures I live up to the hype.
Lastly, and most importantly, is Weezer’s new album, Everything Will Be Alright In The End, which is the band’s first work since 2010’s Hurley. Weezer has kept relatively the same sound since they began in 1994, and this album promises more of the same. After 20 years of making music, lead man Rivers Cuomo still has plenty of material to work with, and it’s exciting to hear new music from the veteran rockers. So far two tracks have been released as singles, and they are a testament to Cuomo’s lasting style, being as comfortable on this new album as they would on the first album, The Blue Album. “Back To The Shack” is also reminiscent of the same old Weezer lyrically, as Cuomo sings of “Rockin’ out like it’s ‘94.” If you’ve ever been a fan of Weezer, this album will be more of the same, and that’s a good thing.

Lykke Li has turned the page artistically with the release of her third studio album, I Never Learn. The Swedish indie pop singer-songwriter’s third album shifts away from the catchy synth-pop songs of her debut album Youth Novels, which included tracks like “Little Bit” and “I’m Good, I’m Gone.” I Never Learn is a somber documentation of Li’s romantic failure, which began with the 28-year-old’s move from her hometown, Stockholm, to Los Angeles. This new Li brought her dark side to the Hollywood Palladium Tuesday for a show to promote her new album.

When the show started, smoke began to crawl across the stage framed with sheer black tapestries as the title track of Li’s latest album began to reverberate off the walls of the Palladium. Dressed in an all-black ’60s style costume complete with bell bottoms and a flowing blouse, Li’s entrance onto the stage elicited cheers of excitement from her eagerly awaiting fans.
Similar to her previous shows, the artist swayed languidly to the rhyme of an acoustic guitar, crooning: “I lie here like a starless lover / I’ll die here as your phantom lover / I never learn” all while gently hitting her tambourine. Though Li established an ethereal mood at the beginning of her set, the more upbeat tracks of Youth Novels and Li’s sophomore album Wounded Rhymes was a play on the mood of the performance.
Li’s hymns of heartbreak and loss evoked feelings of loneliness and melancholy, but no one in the crowd should have expected a Katy Perry concert. The titles of the tracks on I Never Learn are basically descriptive warning labels from “Love Me Like I’m Not Made of Stone” to “Sleeping Alone.” Unlike most performers who deal with such subject matter, however, Li made no attempts to comfort her fans with reassurance that they are not alone. Li’s performance attempted to invoke  catharsis — it suggested the the audience  embrace and acknowledge the feelings of loneliness as a means of release, rather than to go on ignoring them. At one point, Li took a break from her subdued power ballad “Never Gonna Love Again” to yell out to the crowd: “Let’s swim in a sea of love because we’re so lonely.”
“Heart of Steel” is a particularly emotional story of heartbreak that dwarfs the likes of syrupy, simplistic treatments of the subject (for example, “Wrecking Ball” by Miley Cyrus). Li’s vulnerability is expressed both lyrically and vocally as she pleads: “Don’t leave me stranded, don’t leave me alone / Don’t leave me dying, without a lover to hold.” The track also successfully utilizes the assistance of a gospel choir that sings the title of the song as Li croons: “you reel me in,/ […] I can’t let you win” that helps emphasize the singer’s lament.
Cheerful numbers like “Dance, Dance, Dance” and “Little Bit” from Youth Novels were a welcome breath of fresh air, creating a balance between the bleak introspective vibes of I Never Learn, while highlighting the immense change six years can have on an artists.
In a recent interview with Los Angeles Times reporter Mikael Wood, Li spoke about the change in tone of her music.
“A lot of people probably feel like, ‘Hey, what happened to all the time we spent together?’ But you can’t compromise with your art,” Li said.
Li’s refusal to make compromises and her musically diverse talent were evident throughout the night, but especially when toward the end of her performance she broke out into a cover of “Send It Up” by Kanye West. Li strutted across the stage with Kanye-level confidence, rapping along before swiftly transitioning into chanting her own “Youth Knows No Pain” to the same beat — all while receiving screams of approval from the crowd who went from gentle sways to violent head bobbing in a matter of seconds.
The performance ended on an energetic note with Li’s playful and rhythmic “Get Some” from Wounded Rhymes. The singer and her fans danced to the beat of her band’s percussion, belting in tandem: “I’m your prostitute, you gon’ get some.” The night ended completely different then the way it started, with the artist tauntingly singing the final lines of her song: “Got you around my finger like a lonely lover’s charm /like a lonely lover’s charm,” before fading back into the darkness of the stage as fans pleaded for more.
As a musician, Li has made it clear that she is not interested in writing hit, chart-topping pop songs that are easy to swallow; she and her latest work are both candid and honest, but her career — like her performance — may both be trending up.

While watching Art and Craft, a new documentary opening this Friday, one thought persistently comes to mind: No one could come up with this stuff. The old saying goes that truth is stranger than fiction, and that cliché never rang so true as it has in the life of Mark Landis, the central figure. For more than 20 years Landis forged countless paintings and, posing as a wealthy philanthropist, donated them to over 50 museums across the United States. He went undetected from 1988 to 2008 when Matthew Leininger, then the registrar of the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, discovered the deception and proceeded to pursue him like Captain Ahab pursuing Moby Dick. Now that Landis’ actions have been uncovered he can’t make any more donations, as he is well known. He asked for no money and took no tax deduction from the donations, making his actions legal,but bizarre.
Fool me once · Landis donated paintings to over 50 museums in 20 states. He would use several aliases and create backstories for his paintings. He managed to donate six different versions of one painting. – Photo courtesy of Oscilloscope
Landis makes for a fascinating protagonist. As the film opens you see this man hunched over, walking into a Hobby Lobby, cutting the most nondescript figure one can picture. When he is sitting and someone else is talking, he almost seems to recede into the wall behind him. After he starts talking, he speaks softly and hesitantly, constantly stopping mid-sentence to correct himself. But, looking closer, one can spot a glimmer of mischief in his eye and the corners of his mouth. Over the course of the film, it’s hard not to come around and root for this decidedly unconventional leading man. Landis is gracious in defeat and walks the viewer through his many years of “philanthropy” while trying to paint a picture of his reasons for doing what he did.
The film shows Landis painting on several occasions and his natural talent is obvious. He never hesitates. His brush or knife is in constant movement. In fact, he claims that he never takes more than two hours on his museum-fooling reproductions. In the film, people repeatedly ask him why he doesn’t simply make art of his own. It’s a fair question given his talent, but Landis’s reasons for his “philanthropy” are complex and the film tries to uncover them as best it can. Curators he duped speculate that he gets a kick out of outsmarting them, others describe it as compulsive behavior. Landis himself tries to explain it by saying he got addicted to the deferential treatment he recieved while posing as a rich donor. Truly, such an odd way to spend one’s years must come from a complex web of factors. But Landis’s explanation rings the most true. Seeing how invisible the man can seem without knowing his story, it’s easy to imagine the sudden deference to be a strong motivator.
The motivations behind Leininger’s obsession with Landis are less clear. After discovering the fakes, he became so set on tracking Landis across the country that he lost his job at the museum. His hounding of Landis is like a real incarnation Javert’s persecution of Jean Valjean throughout the decades in Les Misérables. In Les Mis, Javert’s obsession is over-the-top, it is unbelievable that one man would be so fixated on getting justice from a single person. But in Art and Craft there is Leininger flaunting his Javert-like determination with pride. The film is centered firmly on Landis, so the motivation behind Leininger’s mania is not delved into with the depth that Landis’s motivations were. This makes Leininger a strange figure in the film. He’s depicted as the sane counterpart to Landis’s murky character but, by the end of the film, where Landis has emerged as a sympathetic character, Leininger is a largely unaddressed enigma. He has a throwaway line about Landis “messing with the wrong registrar,” but that story seems to have more to it than is examined in the film.
Sam Cullman and Jennifer Grausman, the co-directors, crafted a fine, subtle film around Landis. The music is excellent, and it accentuates the offbeat charm the Landis has, while also softening any friction his eccentricities might cause in the viewer. The film also does a good job staying impartial and letting all the people involved carry the narrative entirely, instead of having a unified narrator directing the flow. Landis shows you his art, describes his life and attempts to explain his motivations. Leininger, however briefly, does the same for himself. The two players are kept separate, each telling his side of the story, until the very end of the film when they are brought together in a quasi-climactic moment where cameras catch Leininger and Landis meeting for the first time in five years. Momentarily setting aside any sympathies for one player or another, Art and Craft has to be commended for giving a great sense that the images of Landis and Leininger we are being presented with are very true to their actual selves. The direction has to get the credit for that.
Cullman and Grausman found a story that seems pulled out of classic literature, but is instead focused upon a very real loner currently living free in Laurel, Mississippi. Landis and Leininger are two fascinating individuals and their interplay would make for a very entertaining fictional movie in the right hands. This story, however, doesn’t need to enter the realm of fiction to be captivating and Art and Craft does a great job of showing this.

After suffering through an agonizing upset at the hands of Boston College — the pain of which was extended by a long bye week — not much could’ve further soured the Trojan faithful’s collective mood leading up to this Saturday’s tilt with Oregon State.
If we could just put our heads down and shake off the premonitions of Sean Mannion eviscerating USC’s vulnerable secondary, everything would be fine. Or, at least nothing could get worse. Of course, that was until a certain former head coach began to dominate the week’s college football headlines. Unfortunately, you heard me right; our old friend Lane Kiffin is back.
It all started with Alabama dropping 42 points and 645 total yards on SEC rival Florida last Saturday. Kiffin, who used one of his patented Jedi mind tricks to steal the Crimson Tide’s offensive coordinator job in the offseason, was widely praised for the performance. At least one Alabama pundit even went as far as to say that Kiffin was positioning himself to be head coach Nick Saban’s eventual successor — mind you, this is a part of the country that’s still getting used to the forward pass. Still, USC fans have to be frustrated that a man who did so little with so much talent in his final season-plus at Troy might be considered for what is arguably the nation’s best job.
Inevitably, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Former Trojan defensive back Brian Baucham announced a lawsuit against Kiffin and USC earlier this week, claiming that the ex-coach forced Baucham to play through dehydration, illness and a previous concussion. Baucham, who was carted off of the field with a career-ending injury in a 2012 game against Cal, alleges that he suffered “cardiopulmonary damage” and “brain injury with neurocognitive deficits” directly related to Kiffin’s insistence that the then-fifth-year senior play through pain.
The lawsuit argues for specific damages related to “residual problems” that have left Baucham “unable to compete in the open labor market.”
This is bad news for all involved. Player safety concerns, especially those involving head injuries, are a pressing issue across all levels of football. It was only two years ago that legendary former USC linebacker Junior Seau took his own life, a tragic event that many have connected to brain damage he suffered during a lengthy football career. Even with history in mind, it is important to remember that Baucham’s claims are still unproven — so far.
Even the smartest neurologists in the world don’t know the exact relationship between football and lasting brain damage. But here are some simple facts: Concussions are bad. No one should play football, or any contact sport, with a concussion. No one should play any contact sport with a condition that leaves them more susceptible to concussions, like Baucham was allegedly forced to do. Playing through a head injury isn’t tough; it’s flat out dumb. As simple as these statements seem, however, many coaches can’t seem to grasp them.
Though the sports world has come a long way since NHL all-star Eric Lindros was openly mocked by his own general manager for refusing to play through multiple concussions in 1998, we are still seeing the ugly remnants of a bygone way of thinking.
As recently as 2009, Washington State head coach Mike Leach was fired from his previous job at Texas Tech for locking concussed player Adam James in an electrical closet. Leach, for his part, at least had the kindness to not risk further injury to his player while questioning James’ toughness and making him into a ridiculous example. If Baucham’s allegations are correct, Kiffin didn’t even give him that courtesy.
There is an even scarier side of this Baucham-Kiffin drama: the chance it wasn’t a one-time incident. According to Bleacher Report, sports injury litigator Paul D. Anderson believes that Kiffin also sent former All-American wideout Robert Woods back into a 2012 game against Utah with an obvious concussion. Highlights show Woods stumbling towards the Utes’ sideline after the play in question before eventually changing direction. Woods would go onto miss just one snap.
I doubt any USC fans still think highly of Lane Kiffin. But this controversy goes beyond poor play-calling and a lack of personality. If Kiffin did indeed force an ill, dehydrated Baucham to play or knowingly sent a concussed Woods back onto the field, we have a case of a football coach putting a player’s life at risk to win a silly game. And no matter what you think of Lane Kiffin, no one wants to believe that.

Mr. Hanley.  First of all, I think there are a lot of SC fans who, like myself, think of Kiffin as a possibly great assistant coach.  He still just stands there with the play chart in his face but that seems to be working well, doesn’t it?  Not a motivational bone in his body but his play-calling seems sound.  As for a completely different topic, accusations regarding playing concussed players, why not save that one until any of us know what the hey we’re talking about?

The USC women’s soccer team is firmly focused on its Pac-12 opener this Friday, when the team will travel to take on the University of Arizona. The No. 21 Women of Troy (6-1-2) are coming off of a tough loss to then-No. 12 Pepperdine last Sunday. Though opening the conference season on the road will be a tough task, head coach Keidane McAlpine sees the trip as a great opportunity for the team.

“This game comes at a very good time for us,” McAlpine said. “Sometimes it’s good to get out on the road and bond as a team. It allows us to lock things down away from some of the pressure and distractions of playing at home.”
The Women of Troy know they will have their work cut out for them to tame the Wildcats on the road. Arizona enters Friday’s matchup with a 6-1-1 record after an excellent nonconference slate. The squad’s only hiccups came in a 2-1 loss to a stout Florida Gulf Coast team on Aug. 24 and a 2-2 tie against then-undefeated Texas A&M on Sept. 5.
“Arizona is a very legitimate team,” McAlpine said. “They have some great new freshmen who are playing really, really well. They are very aggressive, straightforward and in your face, so it will be a tough game.”
Among those Arizona freshmen are forward Charlotte Brascia, who is third on the team in both shots on goal (seven) and total shots (14), and standout midfielder Gabi Stoian, who leads the team in shots on goal (16), goals (seven), and assists (four). Though standing just 5-foot-5, Stoian plays much bigger than her frame and will make an impact if USC does not keep her marked throughout the game.
The Women of Troy, on the other hand, will look to lean on their more experienced players for strong play. Senior midfielder Alex Quincey leads the team with 12 points on six goals, and junior midfielder Jamie Fink has 11 points on five goals and an assist. Junior forwards Megan Borman and Katie Johnson are also good bets to find the back of the net, as they are tied for the team lead with 12 shots on goal apiece. Scoring chances might come off well-placed crosses from junior midfielder Reilly Parker, who has a habit of getting behind the defense with quick runs up the sideline.
Redshirt sophomore defender Dominique Randle will help anchor the Women of Troy’s defensive line in front of senior captain and goalie Caroline Stanley. Sophomores Mandy Freeman and Kayla Mills and junior Erin Owen will also contribute on defense. When asked about the trip to Arizona, Randle expressed confidence in the team’s preparation.
“We’re ready for conference play,” Randle said. “We are trying to build off what we did in the non conference season by going over everything we’ve learned and making sure we are fine tuning things we’ve had issues with in order to better execute our game plan. We are also making sure to stay hydrated because we know it will be hot.”
Randle also expressed that her team has moved on from a tough loss to Pepperdine.
“The loss definitely hurt,” Randle said. “However, we’ve learned that we can overcome adversity when the occasion arises, as long as we are able to put our chances away.”
McAlpine agreed with Randle’s statements, expressing confidence that if the Women of Troy are able to execute a little better, they are poised to conquer the Wildcats.
“We are hoping to carry over some things from the last two games, particularly in the second half,” McAlpine said. “We were very good about putting pressure on our opponents in the second half the past few games. We are looking to start with that same intensity, particularly in our defending, but then be able to settle down a bit and not have to play from behind.”
The match will kick off Friday at 2 p.m. PST and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network. The Women of Troy will then take a much-needed break, returning to action on Oct. 3.

The USC football team continued to gear up for its conference matchup against the Oregon State Beavers at practice on Wednesday. After a long bye week, the team is eager to get on the field and make a statement through its passion and energy.

Preach, Coach!
Execution was a point of emphasis at practice, as was moving on from the loss against Boston College. The players practiced with a lot of spirit, and that attitude was a direct result of the coaching staff and their efforts on the field.
“I was really encouraged by our coaching staff’s ability to keep an edge,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “I thought it was evident today, the attention to details on the little things. I think the players felt that today because that’s what we’ve been preaching since the locker room at Boston College.”
Sarkisian was not worried about his defense’s confidence following a lackluster performance on the East Coast, and he emphasized the experience and resolve of the players on his team.
“We’ve got a lot of players on that side of the ball that have played a lot of football and have played really good football at a high level,” Sarkisian said. “I think if anything their pride’s been hurt, and that’s not always necessarily a bad thing.”
The first-year coach knows that any game following a loss is a huge test for a team, especially a matchup against a high-flying offense such as the Beavers. While he did address the challenge that the Beavers and their offense present, Sarkisian also seemed confident that his team will make the right plays and be ready come game time on Saturday.
“Although we’re a team that’s been through a lot, they have a unique ability to keep their spirits high, and they work extremely hard,” Sarkisian said. “I think they’re a team that is chomping at the bit to get back out on the field and not keep talking about it, but actually do something about it, which is a great thing.”
Dynamic Duo
Oregon State is led by NFL quarterback prospect Sean Mannion, a fact that has prompted prognosticators to focus on the Trojans’ secondary and how the unit will respond to a pass-heavy offense. Much of the defensive load will be placed on two young, athletic Trojans who seem ready and excited to take on the challenge: sophomore safety Su’a Cravens and freshman cornerback Adoree’ Jackson.
“[Mannion] is a great quarterback. He can sling that thing,” Cravens said. “I’ve seen a play on film where he threw the ball about 70 yards down the field.”
The strength and experience of the senior gunslinger has not seemed to faze the Trojans’ defensive star, who sat out last year’s matchup against the Beavers. Cravens also said that he is focused on fixing the mistakes that were made against Boston College.
Cravens praised Jackson, saying that the freshman is improving on a week-to-week basis. Jackson is a player that will be vital to the success of the team on both offense and defense, even if he does not get the nod as starter.
“It doesn’t matter to me if I start or not at this point because if I go in there, I know my job, I know my role and I will be used to my best ability,” Jackson said. “I’m just looking forward to getting out there and doing better than my last game.”
Saturday Night Lights
Saturday’s kickoff is not until 7:30 p.m. PST, and players are excited to play under the lights at home for the first time this season.
“It’s a game I’m looking forward to because it’s a night game, and we have to bounce back,” Jackson said. “We still have that chip on our shoulder because people don’t think we have it.”
While Jackson is understandably excited to play his first-ever night home game, it appears as if the appeal of the illuminated Coliseum never wears off.
“The Coliseum is different at night. I feel like there’s a different type of atmosphere,” Cravens said. “We haven’t played at the Coliseum at night yet, so it’s going to be fun.”

This past Saturday, actress Emma Watson gave an impassioned United Nations speech introducing the HeForShe campaign, a promotion through UN Women that invites men to join women in the conversation about gender equality. Watson’s speech could not have come at a more opportune time.
After major hacks exposing celebrity private photos, domestic violence cases marring the National Football League and the Miss America pageant coming under increased scrutiny, Watson succinctly articulated the truth: Women’s rights are human rights, and gender equality involves both men and women.
The year 1995 marked the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China where then-first lady Hillary Clinton proclaimed the beginning of women’s rights as a global human rights issue.
Continuing in that spirit, Watson said that feminism is significantly misunderstood. Feminists are stereotyped as bra-burning, man-hating women who refuse to shave their legs. But really, feminism in its purest form is the “belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities,” as Watson stated. Our societal narrative should depart from the misunderstood convention of gender equality by shifting toward a modern philosophy that fosters conversation between men and women and paves the way for equal treatment and opportunity.
Sexual assault, rape, domestic violence and any other harm towards another individual is a complex issue to approach, in part because of the attitudes and beliefs held by many in society about women. General examples of victim blaming are common in everyday conversation.
“Look at the way she was dressed.” “What do you expect when you wear something that short?” “Just don’t take the photos.” “You shouldn’t have been walking alone.” You hear many people make these comments when it comes to violence towards women. It’s utter nonsense.
The idea that women should be held responsible for the attacks committed against them is completely outrageous. Instead of society teaching women how to avoid potential dangers, men need to be held accountable for the manner in which they conduct themselves and treat others. Why then, when it comes to sexual violence, do we consistently victim-blame?
A common rule of thumb given to men is to treat any woman as they would treat their mother or sister. Though well-intentioned, that philosophy is completely anathema to the spirit of gender equality. It implies that familiarity is the sole reason to treat a woman in a civilized manner. You should not respect a woman just because you respect your mother or sister or other familial female figure. You should respect a woman because she is a human being who should be treated equally and given the same opportunity and treatment as anyone else. Women are not delicate creatures who should be thought of as fragile. Women are human beings. Feminism shouldn’t just be a fight left to women. Feminism is gender equality that involves men and women working together towards one goal.
Another recent event that highlights gender disparity is the 88th Miss America pageant, which was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey last week. The Miss America Organization claims to provide over $45 million in scholarships for women. It claims to foster intelligent, knowledgeable and involved citizens who are models for society. But since when does intelligence or dignity involve a bikini competition? And, despite being an organization that predicates itself on scholarships, the Miss America organization paid only $500,000 in scholarships in 2012, according to Esquire. Today, pageants still objectify beauty with the façade of offering an academic future.
Emma Watson spoke for everyone at the United Nations last Saturday. She said what most think but are too afraid to publicly express. In the past, if a young woman had written a speech like that, she would have been viewed as “that indie, hipster girl.”
But that’s the past. Men and women should engage in substantive conversation because feminism is not a female issue, it’s a human rights issue. It’s about time men step up their role in supporting it.

Sometimes, a racially related compliment can unintentionally serve as an insult. An article from The New York Times’ TV critic Alessandra Stanley has been the most recent example of this social phenomenon. In her Sept. 18 review of ABC’s newest show How to Get Away with Murder, Stanley called two-time Oscar nominee Viola Davis “less classically beautiful.” Though Stanley later defended her piece by saying that the main point of her piece was to praise director Shonda Rhimes for “pushing back so successfully on a tiresome but insidious stereotype,” her statement about Davis shows that there are still walls to overcome when discussing standards of beauty.
Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
 
With the power to widely distribute images in TV and magazines, the media has long set a mold for the face of beauty. More often than not, African American women have not been considered beautiful, a notion rooted in the long history of racism in this country. Referring to Davis, Stanley wrote, “The actress doesn’t look at all like the typical star of a network drama. Ignoring the narrow beauty standards some African-American women are held to, Ms. Rhimes chose a performer who is older, darker-skinned and less classically beautiful than Ms. [Kerry] Washington.” Though she acknowledged that there are unfair beauty standards for women of color — and also a preferred look for African-American women — Stanley seems to be aligning with those same unreal standards.
Stanley could have praised Davis for being on a network show despite the actress starring in feature films. She could have praised Davis for being the lead of a show when there are so few women in that position. Instead, she chose to call the an acclaimed actress “less classifcally beautiful” than the lighter-skinned Washington, shifting the conversation to her race.
Another point of contention with the article is its name — “Wrought in Rhimes’s Image.” For one, the article incorrectly stated that the executive producer Shonda Rhimes, who is also a black woman, was the creator of the latest show that placed another African-American woman as its lead. The fact is that a white man, Peter Nowalk, created How to Get Away with Murder. Yet that was not the most upsetting part of Stanley’s assessment of how black women are portrayed in the media.
Stanley did not have to use harsh comparisons and misconstrued ideas to get across a point. Davis’s beauty and professional accomplishments should stand for themselves if we are truly comparing African-Americans with their white counterparts.
When TV critics evaluate shows, their assessments should be based on the viability of plot. It should not center on the racial makeup of the characters. That’s what makes shows similar to How to Get Away with Murder, such as Rhimes’s Scandal, so interesting. Viewers are drawn into the plotlines. A character’s race is just one of his or her many attributes.
Though the article, with its wild claims and opinions, might not be cause for Stanley’s termination, it does show that changes need to be made when discussing standards of beauty. The New York Times’ culture editor Danielle Mattoon wrote on Monday, “This is a signal to me that we have to constantly remind ourselves as editors of our blind spots, what we don’t know, and of how readers may react.”
The only way to make these necessary changes in the way we think of African-American women and what makes them beautiful is to talk about it.
Stanley’s assessment of the latest show from Rhimes’s production company reveals how much work still needs to be done when it comes to race relations in the United States. The mere fact that it sparked such widespread conversations, however, shows that dialogue and understanding are achievable, so that when TV watchers tune in, they can be in tune with beauty standards that should reflect our multicultural world.

Change is on the horizon in college sports, as universities will have the option of paying athletes beginning in 2016.
This comes after U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ruled in favor of former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon in his case against the NCAA in August. Once athletes’ college careers end, they could potentially be paid through a trust fund that is to be set up.

There is no doubt this will have benefits for athletes. Finally, these student-athletes will get some compensation for all the money they bring into their respective universities and the NCAA, and be able to get through college without “going hungry”, as former Connecticut basketball guard said following the team’s National Championship victory.
Nonetheless, this change could forever alter the landscape of college sports, especially college football. One of the reasons people love college football is because it’s not the same as the NFL, in part to the many traditions the sport evokes and because of the culture surrounding the many colleges programs, rather than just the individual.
If you just take some time to watch the intro to “College Football Live”, you will hear and see fight songs, rowdy fans, and be able to observe the over-arching legacy of a college program.
Many big-time players are able to become very famous rather quickly in college football; for instance, Texas A&M quarterback Kenny Hill was all over ESPN after throwing for over 400 yards against South Carolina in the first game of his collegiate career.
Despite the great amount of attention those such as Kenny “Football” have received, a player can get in trouble for expressing his/her individuality. While NFL players, like Aaron Rodgers, are famous for touchdown dances or signature moves, a college player who celebrates or so much as unnecessarily dives into the end-zone can be penalized by the referees. 
This may seem unfair, but after all, it’s college football. But in the future with program’s potentially paying players, the thin line between an individual and the team may become blurry.
Many players have already acted like they are entitled to certain privileges including former Aggie’s quarterback Johnny Manziel or last year’s Heisman trophy winner in Florida State QB Jameis Winston.
What will happen when big-name players for big-name programs know that will be paid for their services regardless of the outcome of the game? It very well may become more difficult for some players to maintain their discipline and focus on the team when they know they will be getting paid potentially thousands of dollars.
Another reason people love college football is to see Cinderella teams or underdogs upset the Goliath’s by wining big-time bowl games against big-name power five conference opponents like when Boise State beat Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl or when TCU beat Wisconsin in the 2011 Rose Bowl.
Nevertheless, the powerhouse football programs may further distance themselves from the smaller ones with this recent court decision. Many highly-ranked recruits out of high school may start making their decisions based on which program will potentially pay them the most, and the Alabama’s, the USC’s and the Texas’s of the world will be able to offer them what they want, leaving the Boise State’s at an even greater recruiting disadvantage than they are at now.
Paying college athletes is probably the right decision, but college football and its programs must be very careful in order to maintain their identities.
