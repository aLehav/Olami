The Undergraduate Student Government discussed meeting with project managers over community vaccine outreach, Office of Student Accessibility Services accommodations at coronavirus testing sites and announced new advocacy campaigns during Tuesday’s Senate meeting. 
Speaker Ruben Romeo began the meeting by addressing USG efforts to provide assistance and relief to various groups on campus, including the USC Burmese Student Association, the Afghan community and efforts to help with east coast disaster relief. 
Sen. Hunter Hinson and Sen. Arie Abija are assigned to east coast relief and will be meeting over the next few weeks to assess how USG can help efforts, Romeo said. Romeo is also attempting to recruit Senators to communicate with and help the Burmese Student Association and Sen. Tommy Nguyen and Russell Augustin are attempting to “tangibly help” the USC Afghan community.  
Following Romeo’s address, Chief Funding Officer Adenike Makinde announced ongoing USG advocacy efforts for students, including textbook exchanges, technology exchanges and justice equity and inclusion workshops to train staff, faculty and “ourselves.”
Senior Executive Aide and COVID-19 Response Committee Chair Katelyn Lee provided updates on ongoing efforts regarding USC‘s coronavirus policies and concerns such as information on coronavirus case location and what students should do when they feel sick. USG has taken efforts to communicate policies with the student body, answering questions on the USG Instagram through the stories feature and hosting monthly meetings with Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman.
“That’s been really great to see, students sending in questions … Whether that’s gameday cases or policies regarding guests in dorms and a lot of miscellaneous questions that come in,” Lee said. 
In her previous meeting with Van Orman, Lee said she raised concerns about accessibility issues at testing sites and how the University can ensure all students can safely access testing.
“Even though there is a policy in place that people with OSAS accommodations don’t have to wait in line, that’s not something that people are aware of,” said Lee in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Even so, it feels awkward to try to cut in line, so I think there’s some issues.”
In the meeting, Lee said the Jefferson testing location is faster and more accessible to students with accommodations. 
Advocacy liaison Timothy Wang and Nguyen, who initially brought attention to accessibility concerns, have also worked with Lee to make testing sites more accessible and provide resources to aid with any complications that may arise, including long lines.
With the approaching flu season, Lee also announced a campaign with Keck Medicine to encourage flu shots appointments to avoid risks to student health and prevent strain on hospitals.
“​​There’s been increasing research on co-infection and how that could impact a student’s body,” Lee said. “We want to make sure that students are protected from the flu as we want them to be protected from COVID.” 
At the end of the meeting, Sen. Hinson said he and Sen. Nivea Krishnan recently met with Student Basic Needs to discuss the Trojan Food Pantry, which is currently closed due to “understaffing and reopening issues within Student Basic Needs and the University.”
Despite the closure, Hinson said students can reach out to Student Basic Needs for local food pantries and emergency dining hall swipes.

USC students seem to hold a shared hostility toward the administration. As the students’ common enemy, the administration has been on the defensive for many issues, including pass/no pass policy, tuition cost and coronavirus regulations. Since the school has not listened to complaints in the past, students have resorted to taking big actions to voice their concerns to the administration — publicizing large petitions, writing articles and speaking to the media to pressure the school into hearing their voices. 
In Fall 2020, Professor Greg Patton was placed on leave for saying a Chinese word that sounded similar to an English racial slur during a lecture. At first, USC sided with the students’ complaints about Patton’s inappropriate use of language. 
However, in less than two weeks, the story took the media by storm, with many stating USC’s decision was inappropriate. Stories appeared on well-known news websites including CNN, NPR and the Los Angeles Times. More than 25,000 people signed a petition that demanded Patton be reinstated as a professor of business communications. Only after extremely negative coverage did USC address students’ concerns, admitting that Patton’s use of the Chinese word was valid. 
This example is only one of many situations where the USC administration would not listen to students until the issue was covered by the media, which, consequently, made it into a bigger issue. For example, students have had problems with SJACS for years, but USC did not take any action until articles, memoirs and petitions circulated. Students should not need to take such large actions to communicate their concerns to their own school. 
The reason USC is so plagued by sensational news stories is not because the students are causing the problems, but because the administration refuses to listen to concerns until they become big media stories. By taking student interests seriously, the school can not only better assist students, but also nip these issues in the bud before they gain negative coverage. 
There needs to be a way for people to communicate with the administration directly instead of relying on USC’s public relations team to find their stories online. Students should be able to directly express their concerns to USC, who in turn should prioritize listening to them. 
A more transparent and honest communication channel would resolve many of the current conflicts today. The school should provide a feedback form where students can express their opinions freely, and USC should read and consider each one. With recent concerns over the school’s handling of coronavirus, students feel more nervous than ever. Many are worried about the long testing lines, USC’s contradictory regulations and hybrid classes. 
Students shouldn’t need to talk to media stations to be heard by their own school; the complaint’s validity shouldn’t be dependent on whether it comes from one student or all the country’s news outlets. Student complaints are real and shouldn’t be devalued just because the school isn’t receiving public backlash for those issues. The University needs to depart from optical promises and actually commit to properly addressing students’ concerns. 
USC needs to take students’ concerns seriously because they care about students, not because the media pressures the school to do so. The administration needs to evaluate these issues based on how they affect students, not how the issues affect their public image.

In her fourth studio album, singer-songwriter Kacey Musgraves tracks the dramatic progression of emotions following her recent divorce from fellow country musician Ruston Kelly. 
Released Sept. 10, the album arrived alongside a film of the same name, featuring appearances by Eugene Levy, Princess Nokia, Victoria Pedretti and more. 
Entitled “star-crossed,” the album is a thematic reversal to the lovestruck musings of Musgraves’ previous album “Golden Hour,” which heralded the joyousness of falling in love. The glimmering and effervescent “Golden Hour” is speared and disemboweled by “star-crossed,” which Musgraves called “a modern tragedy.” 
The albums contrast one another narratively and visually. The “star-crossed” aesthetic centers around bedazzled medieval armor and piercing, bright colors, whereas “Golden Hour” was defined by its warm tones and flapping butterflies.
As opposite as marriage and divorce may be, there is a definite sonic familiarity between the albums. A mix of upbeat synth-pop and slower acoustics, “star-crossed” confirms that, from bride to divorcee, Musgraves remains herself. 
The changes of pace and style from song to song contribute to the story that the album tells: the chaotic tumult of emotions that emerge, in no particular order, post-breakup. “star-crossed” finds its relatability within its scattered feeling, as Musgraves pinballs between anger, nostalgia, regret and hope.
All together, the songs fling listeners back and forth between feelings of triumph and vulnerability — an emotional progression all too similar to coming out of a relationship.
The first and titular track of the album, “star-crossed,” instantly establishes the album’s goal of telling a dramatic tale of heartbreak and recovery. Stacked vocal harmonies, a haunting Latin guitar progression and angelic harp accompany Musgraves’ first lyrics, “Let me set the scene/Two lovers ripped right at the seams.” 
The songs that follow capture every moment and every feeling that Musgraves experienced following that severance from a lover. 
Musgraves addresses the mixed depiction of emotions directly in “justified,” which claims her right to heal in her own way. “Healing doesn’t happen in a straight line,” Musgraves sings. “If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle/(…)/Then I’m more than just a little justified.” 
The broad array of feelings defended in “justified” is supported visually in the “star-crossed” film, where jump cuts are used to show Musgraves in varying states of well-being while at the wheel of a car. Musgraves is at one moment dead-eyed and tear-streaked, then jubilant and carefree the next.
The fun of the album comes from Musgraves’ moments of triumph. In “cherry blossom,” Musgraves compares herself to a beautiful but short-lived flower — gorgeous while she’s there, but gone all too soon. “I’m your cherry blossom, baby,” says Musgraves. “Don’t let me blow away.” 
A similar energy is found in “breadwinner,” where Musgraves seems to have conquered the divorce by realizing the faults of her ex-lover. “He wants your shimmer to make him feel bigger/Until he starts feeling insecure,” sings Musgraves. 
The fun, energetic Murgraves then gives way to a more solemn one, as triumph fades to vulnerability. In “hookup scene,” there is an underlying sense of regret surrounding the relationship’s end. “If you’ve got someone to love/And you’ve almost given up/Hold on tight despite the way they make you mad/‘Cause you might not even know that you don’t have it so bad.”
The song “good wife” may best capture the conflicting feelings of relief and sadness associated with the end of a relationship. A cheeky satirization of what makes a “good wife” gives way mid-song to a painful revelation that Musgraves, though acknowledging the harmfulness of gender stereotypes, wishes she could have made the love last. 
“God help me be a good wife,” sings Musgraves, through autotune, “‘Cause he needs me.” In the film, this song is played over visuals of brides-in-training, adorned in maid outfits and rigidly practicing their ironing and table-setting skills. Clearly a satirization, the song then breaks down into its vulnerable moment with Musgraves’ wistful declaration: “I don’t want to be alone.” 
Musgraves advertised the album as being “told in three acts,” and it’s the third act that rescues the album from ending as a mournful breakup tale. “keep looking up” “what doesn’t kill me” and “there is a light” all place Musgraves on an upward-looking trajectory, confident in her value and hopeful that good things await her beyond this era of a love that didn’t last.
Some listeners have felt underwhelmed by the album, claiming that what Musgraves marketed as a complex, drama-filled tragedy turned out to be a tame and tidy recounting of a standard breakup. 
It may not be “Romeo and Juliet,” but the fate of Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers is notoriously aggravating anyway. With Musgraves’ tale, we end on an uplifting note of the triumphs that await her in the future, which hopefully we’ll be dancing to someday. I’d take Musgraves over Montague any day, theatrical advertising included.

The Dallas Cowboys may have lost their season opener, but they’ve sure got a quarterback. 
Dak Prescott looked like the early-2019 MVP candidate version of himself Thursday night when the NFL opened its season with a matchup between the Cowboys and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
Prescott, who is coming off of an ankle injury that prematurely ended his 2020 season, threw for 403 yards and three touchdowns. This is a welcoming sight for Cowboys fans after the team struggled mightily in 2020 after Prescott went down in week 5. 
From the beginning of the game, Prescott impressed:On the Cowboys’ opening drive, which started on their own 2-yard line, Prescott delivered a beautiful 28-yard pass to Pro Bowl receiver Amari Cooper. Prescott continued to shine for the rest of the game. 
The Buccaneers were a nine-point favorite, and the Cowboys were a vintage Tom Brady game-winning drive away from stealing the season opener. 
The Cowboys’ receiving corps certainly make Prescott’s job easier: Cooper, CeeDee Lamb and Michael Gallup are perhaps the best wide receiver trio in the NFL. Cooper was Prescott’s favorite target, ending his night with 139 yards and two touchdowns. Lamb also finished with over 100 yards and a score. 
Where the Cowboy’s offense fell short was in the running game. Pro Bowl running back Ezekiel Elliott only managed 33 yards on 11 carries. The Cowboys have a recent history of a dominant offensive line, but this was the first game for right tackle La’el Collins since his offseason hip surgery, and that was apparent. 
Before Prescott’s nasty ankle injury, he was among some of the best quarterbacks in the league. Five games into the 2020 season, he was an early MVP candidate averaging 370 passing yards per game. His strong performance recently earned him a four-year, $160 million contract extension, despite concerns over his longevity after the injury. 
Now the Cowboys know the deal has the potential to pay off. In a wide-open NFC East, which only took seven victories for the Washington football team to win in 2020, the Cowboys are a favorite to come out on top. 
After the question “Is Dak ready?” was answered Thursday night, the Cowboys have plenty of reason to remain optimistic. Performing so well against such a dominant pass rush and solid secondary and coming within two points of defeating the defending Super Bowl champions is no small task. Not only is Prescott a mobile quarterback with a great arm, but his quickness allows him to turn busted plays into points. 
Prescott could be in a great position to win MVP this season, not to mention Comeback Player of the Year. Matthew Stafford, Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes are all primed to have excellent seasons themselves, and could easily add this year’s trophy to their collection. However, with such a loaded receiving corps and a promising offensive line, Prescott, too, will have strong weapons at his disposal. While a flailing defense isn’t beneficial to the Cowboy’s chances of winning close games, it could provide Dak with opportunities to prove himself by coming back late in games. 
While Prescott is on a potential path to the MVP title, Dallas as a whole is still flawed. Ezekiel Elliott struggled behind an injury-ridden offensive line last year, and needs to prove that he is still a Pro-Bowl-caliber running back. The Cowboys have a subpar defensive line and a secondary that is among the worst in the league. While it isn’t hard to see the Cowboys making the playoffs, their defense will have to show significant improvement in order for them to compete with the likes of the New Orleans Saints, the Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC title. 
Prescott’s comeback from injury should be celebrated: his broken ankle was a devastating injury and there was concern that he wouldn’t be able to return to his status as a top-10 quarterback. But Thursday night, he showed that he can compete with the very best. Whether you’re a Cowboys fan or not, the NFL is a better league with Prescott back.

“Eddie On Aux” is a biweekly series on a few songs that intrigue me. They don’t have to be earth-shattering or terrible, just something interesting enough to warrant writing about. It is not a recommendation of what to play in the car to impress your friends, despite what the title suggests. 
Baby Keem — “16”
Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar are “range brothers’’ now, whatever that means. Lamar proved to the world that he, too, can become a meme, and Keem has the talent to be a crossover pop star, as he showed on “16,” the closing track of his debut album “The Melodic Blue.”
Over DJ Dahi’s danceable, yet nostalgic, production, Keem sings his heart out, crooning lines like, “Won’t you think about you and I/Just grab my hand and look me in the eye.” What’s missing in lyrical depth is made up for by Keem’s talent; he turns platitudes into a convincing argument. Though “16” doesn’t have quite the self-deprecation of a typical Juice WRLD song, one could imagine the late artist delivering the same sad-pop track.
This turn to pop is a good development for Keem’s musical outlook, whose discography so far has mostly alternated between boisterous raps and moody ballads. Lately, he’s been associating with Lamar more often, and the Compton rapper is featured on three of his songs. But Keem doesn’t need to emulate his cousin. He’s a solid lyricist in his own idiosyncratic way, and his appeal transcends genre. 
King Krule — “Out Getting Ribs” (live)
The London singer/producer/multi-instrumentalist born Archy Marshall has been one of the most tortured, inventive artists of the past decade. He was only 16 years old in 2010 when he wrote and released “Out Getting Ribs” to Bandcamp under the moniker Zoo Kid—because he was only a kid back then. But most teenagers don’t draw inspiration from Jean-Michel Basquiat, and most teenagers also don’t begin a song deadpanning, “And hate, runs through my blood.”
Most artists spend a lifetime developing a voice that comes instinctively to King Krule. His music reads like poetry, and it demands close listening. Over the years, he’s expanded his musicality to encompass lo-fi hip-hop, punk, jazz and any subgenre that has “-wave” in its name. This exploration of sound is Marshall’s method of finding new brushes to paint the same pictures — like the throes of a depressed psyche submerged in deep waters, or the hopeless youth stumbling around a bleak, gray cityscape. 
The live version of “Out Getting Ribs,” revisited 10 years later in concert, is even more satisfying than the album version. Without the artificial polish of a studio recording, the simple guitar riff that propels the song sounds even better, and the layers of drums and Ignacio Salvadores’ baritone saxophone adds an improvisational touch. Mostly, Marshall has a great feel for the environment, and lets the crowd pulse with the peaks and valleys of the timeless track.
Kanye West – “Life of The Party” (leak)
“Life of the Party” is an amazing song — it would’ve been one of the best tracks on “Donda” had it made the album, and it would’ve been one of the best songs Kanye West had made in his career. It features a signature Kanye flip of a soul sample, a rare appearance from André 3000 and a recording of DMX with his daughter that sounds like it came straight from his camera roll. West’s probably the only artist in the world that has the clout and range to collect these clips, like a despot obtaining fine jewels. 
But “Life of the Party” was left off “Donda,” supposedly because of Andre 3000’s feature that conflicted with West’s “no profanity” policy. Absurdly, André was the one who understood the assignment; he reaches deep and delivers a compelling verse of confession and questioning, one that seems genuinely dedicated to his late mother. The same can’t be said for West who gets sidetracked to take unnecessary shots at Drake. Ironically, if the two artists hadn’t continued their tiring and unnecessary beef, this song likely wouldn’t have come to light. 
Snail Mail – “Pristine”
Some people credit Olivia Rodrigo for making angsty punk popular again, introducing Gen-Z to the Avril Lavigne and Paramore types that were millennial favorites. Snail Mail, born Lindsey Jordan, takes from the same influences as Rodrigo, but with a bit more lo-fi and a little less gloss. Like Clairo, she makes indie rock that can also charade as bedroom pop. 
But, unlike some of her more well-known counterparts, Snail Mail is still working on finding the right audience. It won’t be long though — behind her guitar is a vulnerable, relatable personality. “Pristine” sounds personal, but also like it could’ve been written in any introverted college kid’s diary, slightly overwhelmed and tired from the social experience. “It just feels like the same party every weekend, doesn’t it? Doesn’t it?” Jordan sings. I’m sure some of us feel the same way.

Clay Helton’s reign as head coach of USC is over just two games into his seventh season. Helton’s time in charge will be remembered for a long-awaited Rose Bowl win, USC’s first losing season since 2000 and overall largely inconsistent play. 
Season 1: 
8-6 overall record
After three seasons as USC’s offensive coordinator, Helton took over five games into the 2015 season when the University fired former head coach Steve Sarkisian. Even though Helton ended up losing two games in the regular season to Notre Dame and Oregon, he took down No. 3 Utah. He took the Trojans to the Pac-12 championship and Holiday Bowl but ended up losing both, leaving the Trojans unranked at the end of the season.
Season 2: 
10-3 overall record
After a shaky first season as head coach, Helton vastly improved his second season in charge. First, he named Max Browne as the starting quarterback to kick off the 2016 season. However, after the Trojans posted a 1-2 record in their first three games including a season-opening 52-6 loss to Alabama, Helton decided to give the starting job to freshman Sam Darnold. 
This change turned the Trojans’ season around as they won nine of their remaining 10 games, with the only loss coming in Darnold’s first game against Utah. Helton and USC defeated two top-five teams in his second season as head coach, beating No. 4 Washington and No. 5 Penn State in the Rose Bowl. At the end of the season, USC was ranked No. 3 in the AP Poll. 
Season 3: 
11-3 overall record
Coming off the spectacular 2016 season, USC looked to compete at the highest level once again with potential national championship hopes. Helton and the Trojans maintained a relatively strong regular season again in 2017, only losing to No. 16 Washington State and No. 13 Notre Dame. USC faced Stanford again in the Pac-12 championship, but this time Helton and company pulled out a win to take the team to the Cotton Bowl. Unfortunately, the Trojans easily fell to No. 5 Ohio State, 24-7. USC finished at No. 12 in the AP Poll.
Season 4: 
5-7 overall record
After an exciting 2017 season, the Trojans were left with big shoes to fill after losing Darnold and running back Ronald Jones II to the NFL. Helton named freshman JT Daniels as USC’s starting quarterback. 
The Trojans started the 2018 season off with a 43-21 win against UNLV but struggled the rest of the season, losing to all the Pac-12 teams in California, as well as No. 5 Notre Dame and No. 9 Texas. Helton and USC’s 5-7 overall record marked its first losing season since 2000 and the Trojans finished the season unranked. 
Season 5:
8-5 overall record
Despite a disappointing 2018 season, Helton returned in 2019 with a revamped coaching staff looking to make some adjustments. Daniels returned as starting quarterback with freshman Kedon Slovis as backup. However, after Daniels suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first game against Fresno State, Helton put Slovis into the game where he led the Trojans to a 31-23 win. Slovis started the next game, leading USC to a 45-20 victory over No. 23 Stanford. The Trojans finished 7-2 in conference play and made it to the Holiday Bowl where they lost to No. 16 Iowa 49-24. USC finished the season ranked No. 22. 
Season 6: 
5-1 overall record
USC and Helton faced an easier and shortened schedule in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Helton kept Slovis as the leading signal caller. Fans were not in attendance and the season started much later than usual, with the first game played Nov. 7. The Trojans managed to get a close 28-27 win against Arizona State to open Helton’s only undefeated regular season as USC head coach. 
Helton and USC added wins against Arizona, Utah, Washington State and UCLA to bring the Trojans to the Pac-12 championship. USC ultimately lost in disappointing fashion to Oregon by a score of 24-31. 
Season 7: 
1-1 overall record
Helton put up an impressive 30-7 win against San José State to start off his final season. However, in the following game at home, the Trojans unexpectedly lost to Stanford, 42-28. The Monday following the game, Athletic Director Mike Bohn fired Helton. 
Helton’s Trojans won the Pac-12 in 2017, his only conference championship as head coach. His overall record at USC was 46-24.

Associate head coach Donte Williams will take over as interim head coach of USC football, USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced on Twitter Monday. The decision follows former head coach Clay Helton’s firing the same day and begins USC’s “national” coaching search.
Widely regarded as one of the nation’s best recruiters, Williams will now lead the Trojans in their remaining 10 games this season. Prior to his role as interim head coach, Williams held positions as associate head coach, cornerbacks coach and defensive pass game coordinator for USC. 
“This season is just getting started and we have the opportunity to really do something special with this team and this program,” Bohn wrote in a statement Monday. “Donte is an experienced and well-respected coach who is renowned for his ability to develop relationships with student-athletes, and I appreciate his willingness to take on this challenge.”
A native Southern Californian, Williams went to Culver City High School and Pasadena City College before his coaching career. He grew up watching the Trojans play on television. Now, he will be the one on screen leading USC.
His college coaching career began at junior colleges such as Los Angeles Harbor College, El Camino College and Mt. San Antonio College. After 10 years, he was named cornerbacks coach at Oregon before joining the Trojan coaching staff in 2019. During his tenure at Eugene, Williams was named top recruiter in the Pac-12 of the 2020 cycle by 24/7 Sports. 
In recent years, Williams has been part of USC’s quest to “Take Back The West,” a campaign to retain homegrown talent. Williams played a prominent role in bringing five-star and No. 2 recruit in the nation Korey Foreman to USC last summer. He also helped jump the Trojans’ recruiting ranking 50 spots for the class of 2021. 
“Successful time here: I see all the guys I coached get their degree. That’d be first,” Williams said in a Q&A with the Daily Trojan last fall. “The second is to win a national championship, so that’s more of a team goal. The third thing is all these guys that play in these games for us and play at those spots, that they get drafted and make their dreams come true.”

The USC School of Dramatic Arts plans to renovate the United University Church building — transforming the 80-year-old building that has been a center for religious events, administrative offices, the Haven Outpatient Center and the Good Karma Cafe into a “vibrant new home” for the school, SDA Dean Emily Roxworthy announced at the 75th anniversary celebration last week.
The five-story building’s renovations are slated for completion by December 2023 and will include two new performance venues, a new office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, an audio design lab, digital media suite, new classrooms, rehearsal spaces and a cafe and courtyard. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life Varun Soni wrote that, while religious programming has not been offered at the United University Church for “the past several years,” the church played a “central and inspiring role” at USC.
“Not only has it provided liturgical and worship services, as well as pastoral care and spiritual counseling, but it has also been in the frontline of the struggle for social justice, equity and inclusion, peacebuilding, LGBTQ+ advocacy and support, and community service,” Soni wrote. 
According to the SDA announcement, the new renovations will attempt to preserve the building’s “historic feel” by retaining the original ceiling, rose and stained-glass windows, and trusses, while incorporating sustainable design.
Xavier Valdez, a sophomore majoring in theater with an emphasis in acting, said he looks forward to a unified space for all of his classes and for SDA to catch up to the other arts colleges at USC, such as the School of Cinematic Arts, which have their own buildings. 
“There’s definitely a lot of feelings every now and then about how SDA, while still being just as successful as a lot of the other art schools in terms of alumni and things like that, really doesn’t seem to get as much love as the other ones do,” Valdez said. “So, to finally be able to have our own space to feel like we’re catching up … [that] is a feeling that we definitely needed.” 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Roxworthy said the new building will allow for greater collaboration between students and faculty. 
“The combination of old and new is a perfect metaphor for training USC students in the ancient art of theatre within the context of our Hollywood location,” Roxworthy wrote. “The location in the USC Arts Corridor will enable unprecedented levels of interdisciplinary collaboration with our fellow art schools.”
Javi Casanova, a sophomore majoring in theater, said he is currently in a class that changes locations every day because of the lack of dedicated space for SDA classes. With the new building, SDA will “finally” have a space that recognizes the work of their students, Casanova said.
“[The current SDA buildings] are really sort of afterthoughts, especially compared to the School of Cinematic Arts just literally right down the street from us,” he said. “It feels great to know that we’re getting some recognition from the University for our work.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, Presbyterian and United Methodist previously owned the building for decades before USC’s purchase in 2015. Before, the University rented the space and used it for religious groups, writing programs, the Thornton School of Music and the faculty senate. 
While Valdez is excited for the new renovations, he wants to ensure that the current programs in the building are continued. 
“I really hope that no matter what SDA is going to be able to find a place to transport those … because to have those pieces disappear would be a huge loss for the school and for honestly the community,” Valdez said.
Soni said the sale of the United University Church building represents a larger trend of declining religious identification in American life, one that extends beyond USC. Despite the sale, Soni said he feels that the University values the religious and spiritual lives of its students. 
“I know the spirit of the building will endure,” Soni said. “That’s because religion and theater overlap in so many significant ways — in building community, bringing people together to change hearts and minds, creating meaning-making rituals, telling new stories and sharing new experiences, and developing empathy for other perspectives and worldviews.”

In 1965, Harvard mathematics student Jeff Tarr created the first computer-powered dating service, with 8,000 punch cards and an elephant-sized IBM processor. “Operation Match,” whose popularity was spurred predominantly by the participation of young female students, utilized an examination consisting of 75 questions ranging from music taste to “likelihood to kiss on a first date” and “sexual experience ranking.” 
Thirty years later, in a coincidental twist of fate, Jeff Tarr’s daughter, Jennifer Tarr, would go on to marry the OkCupid founder, Christopher Coyne — the unknowing pioneer of the algorithmic dating companies of the 21st century. 
Enter Tinder: Started by USC alumni Justin Mateen and Sean Rad, Tinder is the undisputed leader of the dating app ecosystem and is the highest grossing app of 2019. A cultural icon of college campuses, Tinder found its place during the 2010s tech startup boom because of its quirky yet simple matchmaking system and  its infamous signature feature — the swipe. 
As life on college campuses slowly returns to normalcy, Tinder is raring for a comeback after an entire year of online dating and social isolation. So, what is the magic behind Tinder’s algorithm?
Tinder’s matching algorithm is like holding up a strange mirror to its users. Austin Carr, a reporter at news outlet Fast Company, had the exclusive opportunity to obtain a briefing from Tinder data scientists about the inner workings of their matching system. He learned that the algorithm utilized an “Elo score,” which surgically assigns a number to each user based on the self-learning algorithm’s perceived beauty of them. One’s Elo score would be determined through the synthesis of their collected left and right swipes. 
Combined with geography, age and gender preferences, Tinder would generate lists of suitable matches that would be self-improving in nature — that is, matches would supposedly become more and more accurate with more samples collected. After years of operation, Tinder amassed swaths of Elo scores and developed a numerical index for attraction based on these scores. 
In 2019, Tinder announced that it updated its algorithm. Scrapping the Elo score for a less competitive system, their new algorithm supposedly matched users based on similar swiping histories and common user profiles. But did this really change Tinder’s impact as a whole? 
Regardless of whether the company uses an artificial numerical value or data based on past matching history to assess compatibility, Tinder’s ethical dilemma remains the same: whether or not society as a whole benefits from using a for-profit company’s algorithm to influence their dating life (Remember, Tinder was the highest grossing app of 2019). Looking closer reveals some insidious realities. 
Tinder undermines the freedom of “personal preference” by relinquishing one’s ability to both choose matches and also receive a fancy dinner. 
For one, Tinder automatically pre-generates a list of candidates every rotation — your fate has been decided by the company from the very start. Crucially, Tinder unintentionally promotes the excuse of racial preference. It eliminates great matches that probably would have occurred if the Tinder algorithm wasn’t used in the first place. 
Computer science researchers at Cornell University warn of the growing role of dating apps in reinforcing racial biases: “Men who used the platforms heavily viewed multiculturalism less favorably, and sexual racism as more acceptable.” 
Additionally, they found that “Black men and women are 10 times more likely to message white people than white people are to message Black people” when using these dating apps. The study puts into perspective how a seemingly harmless social experiment can backfire on a society that hasn’t reached full racial equity. 
Does this mean that Tinder as a whole is negative? After all, what would be the classic kickback story without Tinder shenanigans? While Tinder successfully brands and markets itself as a fun and spicy alternative to the contemporary dingy bar meetup, evidence once again suggests the contrary. 
The Center for Humane Technology ranked Tinder as the ninth most likely app to leave users feeling unhappy, with Grindr placing number one. Moreover, a study from Queen Mary University of London found depressing rates of reciprocal interest: 10.5% for women and just 0.6% for men. 
The truth is that — at its current state — Tinder is probably not for everyone. It’s alarming that 2019’s highest grossing app left more users feeling insecure and unhappy rather than encouraging them to put themselves out there. 
While Tinder’s revenue and user base grow each year, Tinder is not the future of dating. This is because algorithms are fundamentally opposite in nature to one of the most important factors in human relationships: unpredictability! 
Relationships are founded on coincidence, circumstance and the miraculous intersection of two unknowing people’s lives. It’s the connection formed through two people experiencing the noise of life. While Tinder undoubtedly connects people together, the true spirit of connection remains firmly in the chaotic process of stumbling on each other at coffee shops and learning about coincidental common passions at organization meetings and during times of happiness and celebration. 
Ultimately, the personal consequences of using Tinder are dependent on the user’s perception of themselves and dating apps. However, this does not give Tinder an excuse to forgo improving their company to create more racially inclusive and open algorithms. Tinder needs to recognize that they play a role in shaping popular culture, especially on college campuses. As their presence grows, so must their responsibility in ensuring Tinder is not a platform for promoting sexual racism and Eurocentric beauty standards.
