Men’s tennis had a strong showing in the ITA Southwest Regional Championships, the last of five tournaments on the road this season. 
USC picked up momentum with wins in both singles and doubles play. In the round of 128 of singles play, three Trojans secured three victories followed by five victories in the round of 64, four victories in the round of 32 and three victories in the round of 16. Following the round of 16, junior Samuel Rubell beat Arizona sophomore Herman Hoeyeraal 6-3, 7-5 in the quarterfinals to advance to the semifinals where he lost a competitive match to Pepperdine sophomore Pietro Fellin 6-2, 6-7(7), 6-3. Junior Stefan Dostanic also got a quarterfinals victory as he beat freshman Alexander Hoogmartens of UCLA 6-4, 6-4 to advance to the semifinals. Dostanic, however, had to retire from the match at 6-1, 1-4 because of an ankle injury. Dostanic has been ruled out for USC’s next tournament. 
“We’re going to hopefully know a little bit more come the weekend,” said Head Coach Brett Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “The ankle’s a little tender but the swelling wasn’t too bad.”
The Trojans also had a very strong showing in doubles play as they opened with a win in the round of 64 and went on to secure three wins in the round of 32 and three more wins in the round of 16. 
In the quarterfinals, USC won all three of its matches as graduate student Paul Barretto and junior Ryder Jackson beat junior Drew Baird and Alexander Hoogmartens of UCLA 8-2, Dostanic and Rubell beat junior Victor Castro and senior Joe Tyler of San Diego State 8-6, and senior Bradley Frye and freshman Peter Makk defeated sophomore Kai Brady and redshirt sophomore Phillip Jordan of UCSB 8-7 (5).
 In the semifinals, two pairs of Trojans competed against each other as Dostanic and Rubell took down Barretto and Jackson 6-1, 6-2. 
 “When our guys play against each other [the coaches] back off and let them go and … do their thing and let the best man win,” Masi said. 
In the doubles championship, USC’s Dostanic and Rubell took down Revelli and Zahraj 6-3, 6-4. Frye and Makk, the last USC duo in the semifinals, retired their match because of a back injury to Makk as UCLA freshman Giacomo Revelli and senior Patrick Zahraj won 6-2, 2-0.
Makk is in the middle of his first season at USC after his successful high school tennis career in Budapest, Hungary where his highest ITF Junior ranking was No. 22 and he competed in several European championships. Because of his back injury, he will most likely not be competing this weekend. However, the recovery process has been successful so far. 
“He hurt his back pretty badly, but he’s starting to feel better as well and hopefully we are going to get him on the court here at the end of week,” Masi said. 
USC will come into the tournament short-handed with injuries giving other players a chance to showcase their abilities.
 “I definitely wish we had more guys being able to participate … we are a little banged up at the moment,” Masi said. “We have practiced a lot over the last month. To get these guys to compete week after week here for the last three weeks of the fall is super crucial.” 
Barretto and Jackson will be the only two players in action this weekend. This season is Barretto’s first with the Trojans as a graduate transfer after three years at Cal 2017-2019 and the 2020 season in which Cal did not compete.
In the 2020-21 season, Jackson had an overall record of 6-2 in singles matches, 4-2 in singles dual matches, 2-8 in doubles matches and 1-7 record in doubles dual matches. 
Next up for USC will be the Southern California Intercollegiates at David X. Marks Tennis Stadium with teams such as SMU, UC Santa Barbara, San Diego and UCLA competing.
 “It’s always obviously fun to play on your courts and not have to travel … but nothing is going to make them excited like a duel match would,,” Masi said.
The tournament begins Friday Oct. 29 and continues until Sunday Oct. 31.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault, drugging and violence.
Students will be able to choose a pass/no pass grading option for Fall 2021 courses until Dec. 3, the last day of classes, Provost Charles Zukoski announced in a communitywide email Thursday. The grading option was reinstated after it was available to students for the past two semesters. 
The decision comes after “challenges for many [students],” including “intermittent academic disruptions” related to coronavirus testing and class modality, such as when students and faculty must use asynchronous teaching following coronavirus exposures, and “a range of social and political struggles,” including “social justice issues and protests” and the Jan. 6 “riot at the Capitol,” the Provost’s Office said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.  
The email also mentioned the allegations of sexual assault and drugging at fraternities on the Row, including one report of sexual assault and six reports of drugging at Sigma Nu last week. The reports resulted in multiple days of student protests outside of the Sigma Nu house, as well as a march from USC Village to the Row. Since then, incidents of sexual assault and drugging were also reported at other fraternity houses, places off the Row and at other unspecified locations. 
Students will have the option to request a grade of “Incomplete” in a course, rather than the typical requirement of waiting until after week 12 of the semester. The University is also extending its withdrawal deadline until Dec. 3. 
Zukoski also announced the creation of USC Academic Advisor Connect, a “new triage service” for students who feel they need “additional support with advisement, advocacy, or help navigating institutional resources.” The service, which launches Monday, will provide students advisors to work with in evaluating their course options in response to their “specific circumstance” serve as advocates with other campus partners for students in “more complex scenarios.” 
In an email sent to faculty Monday, Zukoski encouraged faculty members to provide compassion and care to students “who may be experiencing emotional trauma and stress” in light of the recent sexual assault reports, and to “adopt appropriate modifications” that allow students to complete their coursework. 
In his email to students, Zukoski wrote that the University hopes the flexibility and new advising resource will help students “progress toward [their] academic goals, make lasting connections, and thrive.” 
“In these tumultuous times, please let us remember the importance of civil dialogue, mutual respect and the essential importance of caring for each other,” Zukoski wrote. “These are hallmarks of the USC community.”

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence. 
The Undergraduate Student Government issued a statement Wednesday night addressing the recent reports of drugging and sexual violence at Sigma Nu and other fraternity houses in an email to students.
The statement expressed USG’s support for survivors of sexual assault and laid out a set of demands for University administration. Demands put forward include accountability for perpetrators, institutional reform and supportive resources for students. 
USG criticized the lack of response from the University since the reports were logged last week, calling the administration’s actions “woefully inadequate in protecting those affected by these crimes.” In the statement, USG wrote that USC’s lack of support for survivors of sexual assault, which it identified as an issue in the past and present, is “unacceptable.”
“There has been sparse follow-up communication from the University, and little information has been made widely available about these events,” the statement read. 
According to the statement, former Sigma Nu President Ryan Schiffilea has been placed on academic suspension and has been detained. The Los Angeles Police Department told the Daily Trojan in a phone call Wednesday that Schiffilea was brought in for questioning but no arrest had been made.
USG wrote that it would like to see the administration “implement oversight” for the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council, and “hold their members accountable.” The statement called for USC administration to compile lists of students who are members of the fraternities required to disband, to publicly disclose how long the University has been aware of the reported crimes at the fraternity houses, and to expel all students responsible for these crimes.
The statement mentioned the organized marches and protests that have been ongoing starting last Thursday, following an email from the Department of Public Safety Wednesday night informing the community about drugging and sexual assault cases at Sigma Nu and calling for sensitivity in the discourse that the events facilitate. 
“In these conversations, we urge students to be respectful and thoughtful in their discussions,” the statement read. “We do not tolerate victim-blaming.”
Following the initial DPS email Wednesday, more cases of drugging and sexual assault have been reported in the DPS Daily Crime Log and a communitywide email Saturday. Cases reported Oct. 25 included a sexual assault that took place at the Zeta Beta Tau house and a drugging at Chi Phi Eta Delta. Additional cases reported in the Crime Log from Oct. 26 included a sexual assault and drugging incident, both at unidentified locations. 
The statement condemned the “victim-blaming advice” and “insensitive language” in the “casual” crime alert email sent by DPS last Wednesday. Enclosed in this email were several “safety tips” for reducing the possibility of experiencing a crime, including using the buddy system, ensuring drinks are kept within sight, and walking in well-lit, populated areas. 
An email sent Friday by President Carol Folt and interim Vice President of Student Affairs Monique Allard addressed these concerns. 
“We also understand that some of the safety language in the TrojansAlert disturbed people,” the email read. “Some TrojansAlert messages are required by the Clery Act to contain specific information related to crime prevention. In the coming weeks, we will look at ways to improve that language.”
As part of its demand for extended provision of resources in support of students, USG said it would like to see the University increase funding for its Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Program and mandate the supply of drug test strips at social events held by the University. 
“The University should use these demands as methods to begin earning back the trust of those who it placed in harm’s way through inaction,” the statement read.
A demonstration involving students and faculty will take place Friday, Oct. 29 on the Row.

For Nickey Woods, seeing a 2017 Southern New Hampshire University commercial was an experience in which she realized the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion. A University official spoke at a commencement in the commercial, calling on graduates to stand up if they were a first generation college student, a mother or in a military family, before saying that “the world in which we live equally distributes talent, but it doesn’t equally distribute opportunity.” 
The commercial, coupled with Woods’ own experiences as a student and observing her son’s educational experiences, made diversity and inclusion something Woods, who now serves as the Gould School of Law’s first ever Assistant Dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, has always been mindful of. 
Knowing Gould was the first top-25 law school to offer a required race and equity course coupled with last year’s events relating to race and social justice, Woods was not surprised to see the creation of the position she would later occupy at the school. Although Woods hadn’t originally planned on applying for the role, after further research, she said she thinks the role is “consistent with USC’s culture journey.” 
“What it signaled to me was Gould is serious about these issues related to DEI,” Woods said. “I think it makes a lot of sense to create a position like this, particularly within the law school, where you’re training people to go out and advocate for things and concepts and ideas related to social justice.”
Woods received her bachelor’s degree in psychology from UCLA and her master’s degree in education with an emphasis in cross cultural teaching from National University. She began her professional career as a teacher in an independent study program in the Long Beach Unified School District, where she attended school growing up. 
For Woods, working with high school students who were having difficulties in the typical high school environment encouraged her to delve deeper into DEI within education. 
“If I’m in an environment where I see things that aren’t right, I feel compelled to do something about it or try to work to make sure that systems work more fairly for everyone,” Woods said.
Calling herself a “Brujan,” — a combination of Bruin and Trojan — Woods worked as the Assistant Dean for Diversity, Inclusion and admissions at UCLA for six years, after receiving her doctorate in educational leadership with an emphasis in educational psychology at the Rossier School of Education. Her role at Gould differs from her previous role at UCLA and involves an element of the law in addition to DEI efforts. 
“In thinking about how DEI manifests in the law school, it’s really how it manifests anywhere, because it’s just working on thinking about the issues that come up when people are engaging with each other,” Woods said. “Because I’ve always had a really strong lens in terms of justice and fairness and social justice, I’ve probably always been a closet attorney, and this role is a really good fit for me.” 
Since joining in mid-June, Woods has met with multiple student groups and faculty members to discuss her new role.
“Because it’s a new position, I wasn’t stepping into a role that somebody else had previously occupied, and I was able to really have this blank canvas,” Woods said. “I’m a lot busier than I thought I would be, but I love being busy and I love collaborating and meeting with people and really thinking about DEI in an innovative way.” 
As for her own aspirations for the position, Woods envisions “three broad but interconnected areas of DEI” – knowledge and skill development, community culture and climate and assessment planning and evaluation – and has worked toward these goals in a multitude of projects, including training lecturers on creating more inclusive classrooms and planning DEI events for Gould students.
“I was able to create a vision for what each of these three broad areas would look like, and it was great because what it’s allowed me to do is undertake initiatives and goals that fall under these categories, and a way that I’m able to communicate on a consistent basis what DEI looks like in Gould,” Woods said. 
Woods also plans on implementing new programming at Gould, such as a benchmark assessment to gauge where the community sees DEI efforts currently. 
“We’re going to use the results of that to inform and guide our DEI efforts for the remainder of the academic year,” Woods said. “We’re also looking at launching a DEI dialogue series, where we invite people from the legal community that do great DEI work back to Gould to talk with students.” 
She also works closely with Gould’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Fellows, four law students who support the DEI office to advance initiatives throughout the law school. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Gould Dean Andrew Guzman wrote the school is excited to welcome Woods, who “brings extensive professional expertise, along with cultural competency, a caring approach and an authentic warmth to our law school community.” 
“[Woods] has shown a tremendous understanding of the sensitivities and challenges of DEI work within an academic setting, and the strong desire to further the law school in its path toward being not only diverse but also a more inclusive place, where all students feel at home, supported, and can succeed,” Guzman wrote. 
Laura Riley, assistant professor of lawyering skills and assistant director of academic success, works with Woods to co-chair the diversity, equity, inclusion and anti-racism faculty committee.
“I love that [Woods] has a background as an educator and she also has a background in DEI from her doctoral work at Rossier. So she understands both the organizational leadership piece plus the academics plus the DEI components,” Riley said. “I just think that combination will be really valuable to the Gould community.” 
Woods said she’s “really looking forward to collaborating with others on campus,” and continuing conversations with USC Race and Equity Center Executive Director Shaun Harper and Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer Christopher Manning. 
“The Gould community has been really receptive of this position thus far, and … [I’m] really excited to be here,” Woods said. “I’ve only been here a few months, I think we’ve only scratched the surface of all the great things that we’re going to do.”

No. 10 women’s soccer enters the home stretch of the conference season with a home game against UC Berkeley as USC looks to continue its hunt for the Pac-12 title. After two consecutive draws against Washington State and Washington, the Trojans look to return to their prolific form against the Bears.  
The Trojans enter their ninth game of the Pac-12 season as conference leaders, as they hold a thin one-point advantage over second-place No. 9 Stanford who has 19 points. 
Despite sitting in sixth place, Berkeley is in the midst of a winning streak of its own as the Bears managed three victories on the bounce, all of which were earned with a clean sheet. Freshman forward Karlie Lema is in prolific form as she has scored two goals in her last three matches, one of which was an overtime winner against Arizona. 
“Cal is an extremely organized team,” Head Coach Keidane McAlpine said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Their goalkeeper [Julia Ortega] is extremely good, so they will be a difficult team to break down.”
USC was without marquee players in its draw against Washington on Sunday, as senior forwards Penelope Hocking and Jada Talley were out of the starting lineup. Junior forward Hannah White and freshman forward Simone Jackson provided vital assists in the 2-2 draw against the Huskies as they were called up to replace the veterans. 
“The players that came in, especially Hannah White and Simone Jackson, were extremely good,” McAlpine said. “It goes to show the depth we have in our team … I would expect those others and a few more players to step up and give us some great minutes.”
Junior forward Croix Bethune has three goals in her last three matches, two of which proved necessary in the draw against Washington. Bethune is the team’s leading scorer and assister this season, operating as an instrumental part of the midfield. She managed a hat trick in USC’s triumphant 5-0 victory over Berkeley last season. 
“I expect [Bethune] to continue doing what she has done and will continue to do,” McAlpine said. “For us, we need her to be that kind of player in order to be the best version of ourselves.” 
USC, Stanford and No. 5 UCLA will face each other in the last two matches of the season in what will be a nail-biting conclusion to the Pac-12 season. 
“You just have to go out and play and let things fall where they will,” McAlpine said. “I think we played a difficult schedule and the next game in front of us is going to be no different. In the Pac-12, there are no easy games … as long as we keep the simple things then we will be just fine in the game.” 
USC will host UC Berkeley at Soni McAlister Field Thursday at 3 p.m.

The NFL made the bold decision to give approximately all of its playoff caliber teams a bye this past week. I’m not sure that made logistical sense, but it did make fantasy football more interesting. It also reduced the amount of content for this column, but regardless, here are the Winners and Losers of Week 7. 
Winner: Wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase and the Cincinnati Bengals
Everyone told the Bengals to draft well-regarded left tackle Penei Sewell with the No. 5 pick in the last NFL draft. Instead, they took wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase. NFL Analyst Brent Sobleski rated the Bengals’ decision an “F,” writing, “Cincinnati’s mistake involves prioritization.” Journalists from both Sports Illustrated and The Athletic were kinder to the Bengals but hardly praised them. Both outlets deemed the selection deserving of a “B,” reasoning that, although Chase possessed elite talent for a receiver, left tackle presented a more pressing need for a Cincinnati team that let quarterback Joe Burrow, a gleaming, shining, shimmering symbol of hope, suffer a beating throughout his rookie season and eventually an ACL tear. And I, uh — OK, fine. I also thought the Bengals needed to take Sewell.
Oops! Sewell has not played particularly well so far, forcing the Lions to rotate him between left and right tackle. Meanwhile, Chase has performed like the best rookie wide receiver in NFL history. Seriously. He’s recorded 754 receiving yards in his first seven games — which is the most yards recorded during a receiver’s first seven games ever — and is on pace to post one of the five highest single-season receiving yard totals in history. On Sunday, he put all his skills on display. He torched a very good Ravens team for 201 yards and caught his sixth touchdown of the year. He utilized exceptional quickness to create separation at the line of scrimmage from Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey, who is one of the league’s best in pass coverage but didn’t look like it when guarding Chase. He also flashed his invaluable knack for picking up yards after the catch, turning a 7-yard slant into an 82-yard touchdown by spinning through what looked like the entire Ravens defense. 
Chase’s dynamic play has invigorated the Bengals offense, which ranks 7th in points scored and pushed Cincinnati to a surprising 5-2 record. Two of those wins came over their division rivals, the Steelers and the Ravens. Last year, the Bengals lost to both of those teams in their first meetings and won just one of their first seven games. This year, though, they’ve got Chase and every reason to believe their fast start can last.
Chase’s performance is also a reminder that for all our prognosticating and criticizing, sometimes the people on the inside are on the inside for a reason. The Bengals decision-makers ignored a torrent of external instructions, and they were right.
Loser: Lions Head Coach Dan Campbell
Poor Dan Campbell. Every week, he finds a way to make the Lions, perhaps the league’s least talented team, competitive — three of their losses have been one-score games. Still, the Lions are an NFL-worst 0-7. 
Campbell leveraged every trick in his book Sunday. The Lions took a 10-0 lead against the Los Angeles Rams, but it quickly faded, and they found themselves trailing 17-16 in the third quarter. Then, they ran their second fake punt and third trick play of the game. They gained three extra possessions due to Campbell’s aggressive play calls, which somehow all worked.
The Lions still lost 28-19. Campbell coached well, but running a team with Jared Goff at quarterback is like showing up to a gunfight with a knife. Goff threw two critical interceptions against his former team to hamstring the Lions’ chances of victory, reminding viewers that the Rams traded Goff to the Lions because he wasn’t good and that the Lions traded for Goff because of the first round picks attached to him. 
It’s hard to not root for Detroit. Campbell promised to “bite [other team’s] kneecaps off” in his introductory press conference, and he’s maintained that same infectious energy. After the loss to the Rams, he told reporters that “If this does not continue to sting and burn and taste like you-know-what, then you’ve got a problem … All it does is just piss me off even more, and it just motivates me to want to get out of this mess.” Sadly, the Lions just aren’t good enough. 
Winner: A Buccaneers fan
The media won’t stop talking about the Buccaneers fan who caught the ball Tom Brady used to throw his NFL-record 600th touchdown and, after a little haggling, grudgingly returned it. The fan did alright for himself. He’ll get season tickets for this year and the next, credit at the Bucs’ team store, and a couple signed helmets and jerseys from Brady. Brady will also give him a Bitcoin, because the apocalypse is encroaching and somehow those things are worth $60,000 a piece right now. Still, people think he should have kept the ball since multiple auctioneers have estimated its value at around $500,000 dollars.
I don’t know what he should have done with the ball and I don’t care. I’m much more interested in another exchange of memorabilia: Near the end of the fourth quarter, Brady spotted a fan holding a sign. The fan was Noah Reeb, a nine-year-old boy from Utah attending his first NFL game, and the sign read “Tom Brady helped me beat brain cancer.” Brady placed his hat on the boy’s head and offered him his hand. Noah shook it. After Brady turned away, Noah placed his head in his hands and cried.
The interaction serves as a poignant reminder that while sports won’t save the world or cure cancer, they provide real meaning and entertainment. In many ways, they function as art — something created with imagination and skill that expresses important ideas or feelings. In this instance, sports, as the best art does, brought people together. Brady, a 44 year-old man, shared his love for the game with someone 35 years younger than him. The moment between them was also a reminder that there’s nothing more valuable in sports than the bonding moments they spur.

Following strong performances in both the Women of Troy Invitational and the ITA All-American Championships at the beginning of October, redshirt freshman Snow Han headlined another tournament for women’s tennis at the ITA Southwest Regional in San Diego. Han defeated the nation’s No. 9 ranked player, San Diego State senior Bunyawi Thamchaiwat, in a comeback victory by a score of 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
Han entered the Southwest Regional with a tournament win already under her belt, having captured the Women of Troy Invitational singles championship two weekends prior. She shared the title with UC Santa Barbara sophomore Camille Kiss, who also went undefeated in singles. Han did not drop a set until her Southwest Regional quarterfinal showdown with Thamchaiwat, winning her first four matches by a cumulative score of 49 games to an opponent’s total of 13. Among those four opponents was the nation’s No. 44 overall player, Pepperdine sophomore Taisiya Pachkaleva. Han eventually fell to No. 53 junior Lisa Zaar of Pepperdine in the semifinals. 
Reflecting on her performance in an interview with the Daily Trojan, Han said that “playing [her] game and being patient” helped her be successful in the tournament. She noted that Thamchaiwat “is a pretty aggressive player” and that in order to comeback from a challenging first set, Han changed the momentum by “trying to keep up with her and play more rallies and [Thamchaiwat] started [to make] mistakes.”
No. 18 senior Salma Ewing had a notable outing as well. Ewing progressed to the quarterfinals of the ITA All-American Championships in Charleston, S.C. two weeks prior. In Charleston, Ewing defeated the nation’s No. 25 and No. 23 overall players, Duke senior Kelly Chen and NC State senior Alana Smith, both in straight sets, making USC the only school with two quarterfinalists after junior Eryn Cayetano’s run to the semifinal. After a bye in the Round of 128 of the Southwest Regional, Ewing defeated Hawaii senior Gitte Heynemans in the Round of 64 and LMU graduate student Eva Marie Voracek 7-5, 6-1 in the Round of 32. She secured her berth in the quarterfinals with another two-set victory, this time over Pepperdine graduate student Shiori Fukuda with a 6-3, 7-6 score.
Freshmen Grace Piper, Leyden Games and Sloane Morra as well as redshirt freshman McKenna Koenig all progressed to the Round of 64 to round out the tournament individually for the Trojans. Morra won in a 7-5, 6-0 match against UC Irvine junior Jenna Schlatter in the Round of 64 before suffering a 1-6, 0-6 loss to Pepperdine’s Fukuda.
The team also had two pairs reach the quarterfinals in the doubles draw. Ewing and Han and Cayetano and Piper defeated doubles teams from Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Northridge, respectively. En route to the quarters, Cayetano and Piper also faced UCLA freshman Kimmi Hance and senior Taylor Johnson, winning the one-set match 6-1. Both of the USC doubles teams exited the doubles bracket in close-fought matches, with Pepperdine’s Zaar and graduate student Victoria Flores topping Ewing and Han in a 6-4 match, while Cayetano and Piper took the LMU pair senior Wiktoria Rutkowska and junior Isabella Tcherkes-Zade to a 7-5 result. 
“I am excited about some of the improvements players on our team showed from the start of season,” wrote Head Coach Alison Swain in an email to the Daily Trojan. “In particular, I think our doubles is headed in a strong direction with our new players becoming more familiar with our system and college-level doubles.” 
The Trojans will be in action next with a trio of tournaments from Nov. 4-7:  ITA National Fall Championships, the Jack Kramer Invitational and the Thunderbird Invitational. Swain emphasized a strong team atmosphere in San Diego.
“The team went into this tournament with a goal of showing unity and support throughout the event even though it is an individual tournament,” Swain wrote. “Not only was that noticeable to our players when they were competing, but I think other teams noticed our unity as well.”

A chill is in the air; the leaves are a-changing and sweatshirts have become wardrobe staples. It can only mean one thing — fall is here, and spooky season is upon us. Although the holiday is known for its frights, it has also provided some of the best episodes from our favorite comedies. Maybe you want a break from horror movie marathons, or maybe you want to share some laughs with friends. Whatever the reason, I’ve compiled a list of the best horrifyingly hilarious Halloween episodes for you to watch, ranked by their IMDb scores.
10. 30 Rock “Stone Mountain” 
It’s Halloween at “30 Rock,” and Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy have to deal with predictable shenanigans from stars Jenna Maroney and Tracy Jordan. Liz and Jack travel to Stone Mountain, Georgia to find a comedian who represents “real America” behind the stars’ backs (and fragile egos), and Jordan avoids the “rule of three” after two celebrities pass away. The only two characters who commit to the Halloween season are writers Frank and Lutz, who try their best to get into a Halloween party. Although Halloween serves as a backdrop for the overarching plot, the episode as a whole is strong and offers a subdued take on the Halloween season.  
IMDb Score: 7.8
9. The Office “Halloween” 
While definitely a cult favorite, sometimes fans and critics don’t see eye to eye. In “The Office”’s first of many corporatized Halloween episodes, Michael Scott’s spirits are dampened as he struggles to decide which employee to fire. In classic Michael Scott fashion, it’s revealed that he waited until the last (and worst) possible day to make the decision. This episode, rife with one-liners and wonderfully low-effort costumes, truly let its characters shine as “The Office” grew into its own throughout the second season. Bonus points for Three-Hole Punch Jim.
IMDb Score: 8.1
8. The Office “Costume Contest”
In Steve Carell’s last Halloween episode before leaving the series, the Jim-and-Pam feels are at an all-time high. After it’s revealed that a new employee (Timothy Olyphant) ghosted Pam years ago, Jim abandons his dedication to ironic costumes to turn heads as Popeye to Pam’s Olive Oyl. The party planning committee also hosts a costume contest boasting a coupon book worth $15,000 as its grand prize, causing the employees to step up their costume games for the win. However, while the employees celebrate, Michael clashes with warehouse foreman Darryl for usurping his authority to take an idea to corporate.
IMDb Score: 8.2
7. Friends “The One With the Halloween Party”
Would it even be a listicle without a nod to “Friends”? Chandler and Monica host a Halloween party, and Monica’s attempt at a costume dedicated to Chandler’s favorite childhood book, “The Velveteen Rabbit,” ends in Chandler donning a bright pink rabbit costume. Oops. However, Chandler’s spirits are lifted when Ross shows up as “Spud-Nik” and jabs that his rabbit costume is no longer the worst. While Rachel vies for the neighborhood kids’ approval and Phoebe finds herself head-to-head with Ursula, this episode guarantees laughs.  
IMDb Score: 8.5
6. Brooklyn Nine-Nine “Halloween”
While it’s difficult to pick an episode that truly highlights the gang’s dedication to the title of “The Ultimate Detective/Genius,” the show’s first Halloween-themed episodes is also the best. Detective Jake Peralta bets a reluctant Captain Holt he can steal his Medal of Valor and pulls out all the stops to win. While later seasons added more involvement of the other precinct members, the rivalry between stickler Holt and childish Peralta proves why many hold this episode close to their hearts. Halloween hijinks run high, and this episode definitely delivers. 
IMDb Score: 8.5
5. Modern Family “Halloween”
This season 2 high point brings out the best of “Modern Family:” Claire Dunphy, a certified Halloween aficionado, makes it her mission to create the scariest haunted house, giving every family member a role to fulfill. But of course, things don’t go as planned. Winning an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, “Modern Family” shines as hilarity and heartfelt moments collide under spooky skies. 
IMDb Score: 8.5
4. Parks and Recreation “Halloween Surprise” 
As Leslie Knope struggles to find Halloween cheer at a costume party after her boyfriend Ben Wyatt gets a job offer that could strain their relationship, office punching bag Jerry Gergich finds himself in a hospital bed after a fright. Halloween doesn’t necessarily evoke romantic connotations, but “Parks and Recreation” shines in its ability to subvert stereotypes when pumpkins and ghouls serve as a backdrop for one of television’s most heartwarming proposals. 
IMDb Score: 8.7
3. Psych “Scary Sherry: Bianca’s Toast”
In this hilarious yet terrifying homage to urban folklore stories, a murder at a sorority house has psychic detective Shawn Spencer and his sidekick Gus wondering if the legend of “Scary Sherry” isn’t so fiction. After Detective Juliette O’Hara goes undercover to investigate, Shawn and Gus meddle in police procedure and hijinks ensue. Rounding out the show’s first season, the laughs, frights and jumpscares are at an all-time high in this underrated procedural dramedy.
IMDb Score: 8.8
2. Curb Your Enthusiasm “Trick or Treat”
Larry David learns the hard way to not mess with the youth. After refusing to give a treat to two uncostumed teens, Larry deals with the consequences of teenage revenge as his refusal to abide by societal norms puts him at odds with his neighbors and his friends. “Curb’s” funniest episodes are often its cringiest, and this episode doesn’t disappoint.
IMDb Score: 8.8
1. Community “Epidemiology”
After a well-meaning Dean Pelton serves Greendale Community College students cheap meat from an army surplus store, a school-sponsored costume party goes awry as a contagion transforms everyone into bloodthirsty zombies. Filled with witty jokes and pop culture references, this high-budget take on the Halloween trope is as suspenseful as it’s hilarious. 
IMDb Score: 9.3

As a business major that can pop and lock here and there under the right circumstances, I’ve always admired those who truly devote themselves to the art of dance as a form of expression.
This form of expression, however, can be challenging to pursue when one’s faith system specifically rejects dance as a proper practice. In Christianity, there is a troubling history of condemning dance in specific spaces — some even deem it an inappropriate means of connecting with religion. 
Xavier Williams, a freshman majoring in dance at the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, is intimately familiar with this conflict.  
For dancers such as Williams, an upbringing in the Christian faith limited his ability to freely express himself. Williams describes his upbringing in the South where, within his Baptist Church, worship was limited to reactions that the church allowed. This included clapping or vocalizing based on the feeling of “catching the Holy Ghost,” but dancing was a frowned-upon method of worship. 
Outside of the church, Williams found there was indeed a place for dance and worship. He recalls that his eyes opened when he was shown scripture from the book of Psalms, detailing worshippers dancing in the mountain of Zion. With this clear evidence in existence, it begs the question, why is dance as a form of worship depicted as evil? 
This form of worship is further solidified in Christianity with the concept of creation viewed through a dancer’s lens. Williams describes that since he believes we were designed by a creator, humans inherently should be creative.
This idea states that people all have the natural ability to convey stories through the power of creative expression. For Williams, this storytelling power can transcend barriers between our society’s distinct communities. He explains that since body gestures are universal, dance is “the opportunity to get away from the dialogue that can sometimes be problematic,” advancing messages in a format that is much more powerful than traditional ways of communicating. 
Xavier’s story becomes extremely important to discourse on Christian worship. As Xavier mentioned, his Baptist Church frowned upon the idea of utilizing dance as a spiritual connection to God, and they aren’t the only ones in the Christianity diaspora to do so. 
Kathryn Dickason, a postdoctoral scholar at the USC School of Religion, recites in her article “Why Christianity put away its dancing shoes – only to find them again centuries later” that King David in the Old Testament was said to have danced naked before the Lord, a true symbol of humility for his ranking of nobility, a celebrated trait in the religion of Christianity.
Despite this, the Protestant and Catholic communities declared dance to be a symbol of idol worship in the 16th century, which notably is a fundamental aspect of many traditional African religions before western colonization, according to Dickason. 
The condemnation of traditional dance customs in African religion is further demonstrated by the pentecostal rituals in Kinshasa, Congo before and after religious colonization. In Katrien Pype’s “Dancing for God or The Devil: Pentecostal Discourse on Popular Dance in Kinshasa,” the article states that the traditional pentecostal ritual in Kinshasa is said to be a dance which one enters “into a trance, a heavily charged bodily and spiritual state which is manifested by being overwhelmed by emotions … an ultimate surrender to a higher power.”
However, with the arrival of European catholic colonization, “Belgian Catholic missionaries” were televised and played on the radio, resulting in western Christian traditions becoming prioritized and the eventual condemnation of Kishasa’s initial ritual. 
Returning to our question, the presence of colonization caused the widespread condemnation of dance in Christianity. With this said, the ridicule of dance in Christianity does not lie in modern discourse, but rather, it is an attempt to wipe out the traditions of African culture by westernizing it entirely. 
With this, I have full confidence that dancers who practice Christianity such as Xavier will be able to re-introduce what dancing means to them — a spiritual demonstration, a form of empowerment against the consequences of colonization. Space should be made for dancing as a form of religious expression.

Last year on the first day of school, four music industry majors’ paths — or, rather, Zoom screens — aligned as they answered the call to revamp an abandoned organization called Music Industry Connections. Seniors Nina Tanaka and Jack Mangikyan, and sophomores Allana Taghioff and Cadie Nussbaum met remotely to decide how to run the club. But what started as a rebrand turned into a complete reimagined expansion within the music industry program.
“We all kind of came up with the idea of a record label because I had always gone into college knowing I wanted to do something with an on-campus record label,” said Nussbaum, a member of the promos team. “I was shocked to find out that [USC] didn’t have one.”
Now rebranded as 840 West, the organization allows  members to not only connect as students but also as their own respective teams and artists. Taghioff said she could make connections to the classroom through her work at 840 West as she learns how to apply her school studies in a realistic and professional setting. 
“I’ve never had a job in [the] music industry, and so you learn about these things in class, but when you’re actually put into it and you’re needing to make these calls and put on a show … That’s what class doesn’t teach you,” Taghioff said.
Student artists are able to put their curriculums to the test in professional settings while still having the support from the University, Nussbaum said. Similarly, Taghioff said she has enjoyed bringing more people on to the 840 West staff this year, now that classes are in-person. 
“I’m in a show on Friday; I play bass for my friend and that whole 840 West community was there, rather than just like two or three people. And so, I just feel like it is really great for those connection purposes,” Taghioff said. “And we’re all in the same boat — we’re all undergrad students with a passion for [the] music industry, so being able to come together in a safe space is really, really awesome and everyone is just so supportive of one another.” 
When 840 West’s meetings were still held virtually, each department only had one or two people. Since returning to campus, however, the label has added many new members, with teams now ranging from five to 15 people, Nussbaum said. One of the largest groups within 840 West is the arists and repertoire team, commonly known as A&R. This team listens to pitches and picks artists for the label. 840 West currently has only a handful of artists and is hoping to add new ones, something that requires a unanimous decision from the A&R team, Taghioff said. Even though the label is split into these different departments, Nussbaum said they still work as a larger unit.
“The nice thing about all of us being together rather than just having sub-meetings is that if I need something from another team I can just walk over and say, ‘Hey, what’s your plan for this?’” Nussbaum said. “One of our artists, Megan Winsor: She likes coming to the meetings a lot, so it’s nice when the artists are there; I can collaborate with her about what she wants on her social, how she wants to be represented through our social, just things like that.” 
This closeness is also one of the upsides to working in a smaller, university wide label, according to Nussbaum. While major record labels are forced to work though non-music-related tasks and jump through financial and legal hoops, student-run labels have a greater amount of flexibility as they are supported by the university. This agency allows them greater creative license. 
“The number one difference [between major record labels and student-run labels] is that we get to run it. There’s not a whole set of rules … and everyone is participating,” Nussbaum said. “It’s nice to have the freedom and collaboration to do what we want to do, figuring it out together.” 
Although the group is close, it is not exclusive; 840 West welcomes all majors to the events it hopes to host in the future, which can be found on its Instagram. 
840 West made its debut Tuesday at Surf House with Mid-Week Insomnia, a Halloween-themed concert. The event featured a DJ and five different music artists, some of which are already signed to 840 West. The line-up included Megan Winsor, Nic Skrabak, Tippy Balady, Frat Mouse, Alex Oliva and Biata as DJ. 
Among the crowd of Halloween costumes in front of Surf House’s porch-turned-stage, Mangikyan said, while he recognized many members of 840 West, there were lots of newcomers as well. This audience aspect, which was not possible during quarantine, is part of what made this first event so exciting. 
“I’m a music fan first and foremost,” Mangikyan said. “So I’m just excited to listen to good music, and of course meet everybody … and just embrace live music again, because we’ve been under quarantine for so long.”

The sound of burgers sizzling on the grill, the smell of coffee, the sight of a milkshake with two straws. Even for those of us born half a century after the 1950s, it isn’t hard to imagine the sounds, smells and sights of the classic ‘50s diner. Although the ‘50s are long gone, the decade’s diner remains an American dining centerpiece.
Not only have the original ‘50s diners remained functional, but chains such as Johnny Rockets also keep the era alive by opening new diners with that same vintage feel. The fast-food franchise opened its first location in 1986 and has since opened several locations throughout Southern California. With its neon color palette, tableside jukebox machines and ‘50s-style employee uniforms, Johnny Rockets has tapped into our American nostalgia.
Known for greasy food and flashy colors, the ‘50s-style American diner is a relic of the past brought into the present. For many privileged Americans, diners are places full of nostalgia, reminders of an era before modern technology and social media. In a world without time machines, diners offer customers an easy journey into the past, so they can spend at least a few hours remembering life before you could search any song on Spotify.
While some Americans may relish reliving the past, most do not have the same luxury. For many communities, the ‘50s were a decade marked by violence and oppression. 
In 1955, Emmett Till’s lynching dominated national headlines after several white men attacked and murdered him for supposedly hitting on a white woman. Although media outlets widely publicized Till’s murder, racially motivated attacks on Black men and women were common throughout the ’50s. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, at least 24 men and women were killed due to such attacks between 1950 and 1959.
Diners do not only immortalize a decade of oppression, but they also represent a segregated past that perpetuated violence against marginalized communities. Diners segregated their patrons and did not allow Black customers to sit at the lunch counter. To protest this segregation, four Black college students staged a sit-in at the lunch counter in a Woolworth’s diner on Feb. 1, 1960.
The Woolworth sit-in sparked similar protests throughout the country, which spread to over 55 cities. These sit-ins, along with the many protests during the ‘60s, incentivized Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which desegregated public facilities, including diners. 
Although the protests were successful, we cannot deny the beloved ‘50s diners represent a decade of turmoil. By ignoring their history and focusing on nostalgia, diners immortalize the past while repackaging a decade of violence as a fond memory.
Nostalgia is a dish best served with a side of privilege, which allows many Americans to look at the past and recognize the plight of marginalized communities. The coupling of privilege and nostalgia gave rise to former President Donald Trump’s well-known campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” This phrase implies America was great in the past, a bygone era to which Trump supporters wish would return.
For instance, in a video by “The Daily Show,” several correspondents attend a Trump rally and ask the attendees when they considered America to be “great.” Every one of the Trump supporters references a time in the past, from the day the country was founded to just after World War II. In response, the correspondent points out the different communities’ oppression at the time, from non-men’s disenfranchisement to slavery and segregation.
Although this oppression makes the past unbearable for many marginalized communities, these Trump supporters can look back with rose-colored glasses because of their privilege. Just like the ‘50s diners, Trump supporters keep a sunshine-and-rainbows version of the past alive in their minds. If they’re never forced to grapple with marginalized communities’ plights, they will never support progress over regress.
I love a grilled cheese with fries and a milkshake as much as the next person, so I would never argue that every diner should close its doors. However, it is possible to keep a cuisine alive without burying the evidence of our country’s sordid past. Rather than building diners that memorialize the ‘50s, we need to create accurate representations of the past that contextualize the era.
We are responsible for learning our history, both the good and the bad, and we can not repeat the mistakes of the past. Constant callbacks to the past, such as the ever-popular ‘50s diner, only hinder that progress. Nostalgia may seem innocuous, but marginalized communities continue to pay the price for our inability to look towards a better, brighter future.

Over the past several decades, learning management systems such as Blackboard and Canvas have redefined the teaching framework in colleges across the country. The days when students would turn in assignments by hand at the beginning of each class are gone. Instead, these platforms organize assignments, announcements and tasks for digital access at any time. 
In theory, learning management systems are a great idea. By expanding the classroom’s reach to a digital environment, there is not only greater connectivity between students and professors, but also convenience in facets such as access to course materials. 
These benefits, however, do not come without drawbacks. If these systems are mishandled, it only takes a few steps for connectivity to become intrusion and for convenience to become a burden. 
Imagine a class taught on Tuesdays and Thursdays at noon. Without services such as Blackboard or Canvas, professors will naturally expect students to submit assignments at noon before the beginning of class. With these systems in place, however, professors have begun to impose deadlines at times such as 5 p.m., 9 p.m. or even 11:59 p.m. 
The argument here is that these “extensions” are by no means generous. Short deadline extensions are not only unhelpful to students making edits to their work but also extend the school day into one’s personal time. In other words, they give a false sense of security that inevitably results in unhealthier study habits.
This extension of the school day is also confusing for many students. Several studies show that an appropriate work-life balance increases productivity, reduces stress and promotes higher quality work. Learning management systems, on the other hand, serve the opposite purpose. By forcing students to constantly be on-call for the next assignment or announcement, they merge work and home spaces, causing unnecessary stress to students.
Although homework is crucial to classwork success, with several professors prefacing their syllabi with statements such as, “For every hour of lecture, you should study for ‘x’ number of hours,” the line between class time and personal time should still remain separate. When these systems continue to make this balance even more ambiguous, students’ mental health and well-being suffer. 
Robert Brooks, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and co-author of “The Power of Resilience: Achieving Balance, Confidence and Personal Strength in Your Life” notes the importance of “unplugging” in our daily lives. According to Brooks, by experiencing quality time to its fullest and ignoring the work alerts and phone notifications, one will begin to develop a sense of resilience. Brooks goes on to note that those who are resilient are often in greater control of their lives and can better deal with adverse conditions, such as stress, effectively.
While it may be difficult to unplug completely from responsibilities, students can adopt a resilient mindset. By making active efforts to separate work and study spaces, both physically and mentally, students can begin to reclaim control over their education. In this way, students will directly play a part in the division and organization of their work, subsequently falling away from “reactionary” mechanisms to systems such as Blackboard or Canvas.  
Professors can also aid in this endeavor. In the midst of a pandemic, it is more important than ever for professors to pay extra care to their students’ personal lives. By assigning more reasonable deadlines and paying extra caution to their announcements or assignments’ repercussions on students, professors can enable students greater charge over their lives.
