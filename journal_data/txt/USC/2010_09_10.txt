After a long summer of training, the USC women’s cross country team will face its first test of the season when the squad travels south to the University of California at Irvine Invitational on Saturday.
2010 represents what should be an exciting year for the Women of Troy, and Coach Tom Walsh is eager to see what the team has to offer.
“You can’t tell where everyone’s at until we get on the field and compete,” Walsh said. “This will be a good indication of what we need to do going forward.”
After a 2009 season when the team constantly felt the burden of injuries and illness, Walsh is being understandably cautious in the early going in 2010. Some of USC’s top runners won’t compete this weekend, including senior standout Szofia Erdelyi, redshirt sophomore and UCLA transfer Shelby Buckley, and sophomore Kathleen Moloney. Buckley and Moloney are recovering from minor injuries, and Erdelyi, consistently the team’s strongest runner, is getting a rest due to an extended spring track and field season.
“We’re just getting Szofia ready for the Stanford meet in a couple weeks,” Walsh said. “She’s not sick or injured. We’re expecting big things from her as a senior.”
Instead, USC will send a talented mixture of youth and experience to UC Irvine and try to gauge what kind of impact the rest of the runners will have this year.
“It’ll be a good test for the others to step up and see if they can contribute as our number one, two or three runners,” Walsh said. “Especially since they’re not used to it.”
Seniors Christine Cortez, Dina Kitayama and Zara Lukens will lead Saturday’s team, along with juniors Leah Gaeta and Jessica Lundin. Rounding out the squad are sophomore Kelly Owen and freshman Jaclyn Wallace, who was the all-city runner up in cross country out of Venice High School.
“We’re going to ask the juniors to step up and be leaders on this team, as well as the seniors,” Walsh said. “This is the girls’ first chance to prove that they can do that.”
They’ll face some stiff competition from all over the state. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Cal State Northridge, Pepperdine, and host UC Irvine all annually field strong teams.
“It’ll be good competition for the first meet of the year,” Walsh said. “In the end, I’m not as interested in a team place as I am to see how the runners respond and how they look after a whole summer of training. I’m looking for improvement level.”
Walsh also admitted he’s hoping for a bit of the unexpected, in a good way of course.
“I’d love some positive surprises,” he said. “We’ve had two weeks to practice, so I’m excited to see what we can do come race time.”

The No. 8 USC women’s volleyball team looks to continue its winning ways when it faces the Virginia Cavaliers Friday at 7 p.m.
The Women of Troy have been nearly unstoppable so far this year. This past weekend, they won the Hawaiian Airlines Wahine Volleyball Classic with three wins, highlighted by their upset victory over No. 4 Hawaii in five sets Sunday.
Virginia is off to a strong start as well. The Cavaliers are currently 5-1 and began the year 5-0 for the first time since 2003. They have already won two tournaments, a feat the Trojans have also achieved this season.
Head coach Mick Haley admits he does not know exactly what to expect from Virginia, but regardless of what the Cavaliers do, he strongly feels the Trojans will be able to benefit from the opposing style of play.
“I think [Virginia] might be using two setters and six hitters, so that’s basically a 6-2 offense, and it allows them to run a lot of movement against our block, which would be great for us if they do that because we really need to practice against that,” said Haley. “I think we can accommodate though if we do the things that we need to do on our side of the net and continue to improve.”
Defense, along with passing and serving, have been the key items the Women of Troy have been focusing on. Fortunately, with conference play still a couple weeks away, the team still has plenty of time to improve.
“If we work hard in practice every day, if we can get better in the practice gym, we have a chance to be very good this year,” said Haley.
One of the team’s biggest strengths so far is its depth. Haley has had the luxury of using 14 players in matches so far this season. And the team is not only deep — it is also very young. The current roster includes six freshmen, a truth that may prove to be a factor in this weekend’s matchup.
“I think Virginia’s still young in that they had two good recruiting classes, so our freshmen against their freshmen and sophomores ought to be a pretty interesting battle,” Haley said.
Overall, regardless of any defensive struggles or inexperienced players the Trojans may have, Haley’s outlook on the team’s upcoming match only seems positive.
“I think it’ll be a good battle, but I feel, I feel good about where we are right now, and I feel good about playing Virginia this weekend,” said Haley.
He certainly has reasons to be confident. After the Trojan tournament victory in Hawaii, junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter was awarded with Pac-10 and National Player of the Week honors, providing the Women of Troy with another reason to feel good about their chances this season.
“I think you don’t want to miss watching this team, to tell you the truth, because every week is going to be something different I think, and you’re going to see somebody else step up, and I hope that happens because we’ll get to be a great team if everybody takes the challenge,” Haley said.

McAlister Field is a welcome venue this weekend for the road-weary USC women’s soccer team.
After successful consecutive road trips, the Women of Troy will host the Trojan Invitational, which invites three teams—No. 25 Auburn (4-1), Northern Arizona (0-2-2) and Cal State Fullerton (2-2)—to Los Angeles. Continuing their string of nonconference play, the Women of Troy will butt heads with another nationally ranked team, Auburn, Friday at 3:30 p.m. After a one-day respite, the tournament will conclude with a 1:30 p.m. matchup against Northern Arizona (0-2-2) on Sunday.
Standing tall · Junior midfielder Carly Butcher and the Women of Troy will return home this weekend for the first time in three weeks, as USC hosts the Trojan Invitational. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Despite the recent encouraging road trips, a theme evident in this week’s practices was the need to shoot purposefully and aim for corners. Offensively challenged so far in the early going, the Women of Troy have yet to score more than one goal in any game, and imprecise shooting has foiled many of their scoring chances.
To help the team visualize its shooting targets, coach Ali Khosroshahin stacked three hula hoops vertically on each side of the net during practice, ensuring that all four corners of the net were highlighted for oncoming attackers.
“We need to keep taking care of the ball,” Khosroshahin said. “We were better than we were all year [in that regard] this last weekend. However, the final third part of the field still needs work.”
The fact that the Women of Troy are finally approaching full health bodes well for the rest of the season, especially since they have weathered injuries to key contributors, most notably leading scorer Ashli Sandoval. Unfortunately, as the team continues to welcome back more players from the injured reserve, it lost junior defender Chelsea Buehning for the season to an ACL injury, for which she underwent surgery this past Wednesday.
Although the Women of Troy have yet to earn a top-25 ranking since the first weekend of the season, they are not overly concerned. Instead, they are using this opening deluge of nonconference games to prepare for a challenging conference schedule — a point at which one game can define a season.
“I think it’s good to play all of these games before we start our Pac-10 schedule because it gives us time to work on things,” Butcher said. “We want to get that No. 1 seed in the Pac-10 [postseason] tournament.”
Khosroshahin was more non-committal in his response—adhering to his philosophy of just focusing on his team.
“That’s just the way it’s done,” he said.
Combined with their usually stalwart defensive effort, the Women of Troy plan to put up some crooked numbers this weekend on the McAlister Field scoreboard. If their dormant offense erupts, they will begin to draw the attention of more national poll voters and even the attention of those Pac-10 teams that are discounting the unranked Women of Troy as a serious threat.

The hype reached its peak around Christmas 2005.
The talk was that this USC squad, with two Heisman Trophy winners in its backfield and two-straight AP national titles on its mantle, could be the greatest college football team of all time.
One game, against Texas in the Rose Bowl, stood between the Trojans and becoming the first team to win the AP national title three years in a row.
But 467 yards of Vince Young offense later, the talk of greatest of all time faded. The Trojans, losers for the first time in 35 games, were knocked off the peak of college football dominance.
But who was to know then how far the stars of that team would fall in the coming years?
As this week’s headlines alone have shown, life has been much less charmed as of late for the protagonists of USC’s last national title-winning team.
The quarterback, Matt Leinart, was the orchestrator of an offense that averaged 50 points per game during the regular season of his senior year. He ended his college career with two national championships and a Heisman Trophy.
Fast forward to this week, when Leinart was cut by the Arizona Cardinals after four less-than-stellar seasons with the team. Plagued by injuries and stuck behind Kurt Warner on the depth chart, Leinart made only 17 starts during his time in the desert.
This year was supposed to be Leinart’s time to shine. With his body finally healthy and Warner retired, the No. 10 pick in the 2006 NFL draft was set to take over the starting job.
Leinart was beaten out, however, by free agent pickup Derek Anderson and the club released the former Trojan on Saturday.
Signed Monday by the Houston Texans, Leinart will serve as a backup again, this time to Matt Schaub.
Leinart’s legendary running back combo, LenDale White and Reggie Bush, ran for a combined 40 touchdowns and more than 3,000 yards as juniors in 2005. Nicknamed “Thunder and Lightning,” the duo electrified the Coliseum faithful by averaging more than seven and one-half yards per carry during the 2005 season.
That success hasn’t translated to the NFL.
Let’s begin with Reggie.
Taken second overall by the New Orleans Saints in 2006, the former Heisman Trophy winner was expected to become one of the league’s biggest stars.
During his four-year career in the NFL, Bush hasn’t gained more than 581 rushing yards in a season — hardly superstar numbers.
And when his Saints team improbably won the Super Bowl this February, it seemed Reggie could relax a little over the summer, knowing he and his teammates had achieved the sport’s highest goal.
The NCAA had different plans.
The announcement of sanctions on USC’s football program, centered on NCAA findings that Bush took money from sports marketers during his time as a Trojan, led to a media firestorm and backlash against Bush from his former fans at USC.
This week, a report surfaced that the Heisman Trophy Trust planned to take away Reggie’s award for being the top player in college football in 2005.
Whether the report is accurate and Bush will be stripped of the nation’s top individual prize remains to be seen, but the story confirmed that Reggie’s reputation has been forever tarnished.
His former backfield teammate hasn’t had a better summer either.
White, drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the second round, seemed to have found his niche in the league as a power back, gaining more than 1,000 yards in 2007 and scoring 16 touchdowns a year later.
White failed to maintain his success, however, ballooning up to 265 pounds in 2008 and falling behind emerging star Chris Johnson on the Titans’ depth chart.
It seemed that White’s career would be rejuvenated when former Trojan coach and current Seattle Seahawks boss Pete Carroll traded for him in April.
Then came the news that White would be suspended for the first four games of the upcoming season for violating the league’s substance-abuse policy (White later admitted to smoking marijuana). Carroll cut White only a month after he signed him, leaving his former running back miffed.
Said White: “Pete Carroll? The same Pete Carroll who ran out on ’SC?”
White, picked up by the Denver Broncos, tore his Achilles’ tendon Sept. 2 in the team’s final preseason game and will miss the entire season.
Carroll, the coach who led the Trojans to seven straight Pac-10 titles, never quite recaptured the dominance of those teams from 2003 to 2005.
USC hasn’t appeared in a national title game since the loss to Texas, and last year the Trojans posted their lowest win total — nine — since 2001.
Carroll fled north, taking over the helm of the Seahawks, while USC was left to find his successor and sort through the sanctions.
Top wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett has had his fair share of struggles as well at the pro level. The man who set the Pac-10 record with 41 career receiving touchdowns as a Trojan has managed to score only once in three years with the Carolina Panthers.
The idea is not to bash the former heroes of USC football; quite the opposite, let this serve as a lament for what might have been.
Whether through injury, lack of discipline or poor performance, the stars of perhaps USC’s greatest dynasty have become a group of mediocre NFL talent.  Their college successes provide little consolation either — the record books that they rewrote together as Trojans now feature asterisks next to their names.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

Saturday’s USC football game against Virginia will not only offer Coliseum-goers great football, but also the opportunity to sample foods from the food trucks featured in The Food Network’s newest show, The Great Food Truck Race, hosted by Tyler Florence.
Gate 28 will serve as the converging point for four of the the seven trucks competing in the Food Network’s reality competition show. RaginCajun owner Stephen Domingue decided to arrange a meeting with his competitor’s trucks — Nana Queens, Crepes Bonaparte and Grill ‘Em All — at the Coliseum.
“Since I was on the food channel, I asked if we could bring the food trucks in and they gave me the OK,” Domingue said.
The day will give football fans the opportunity to be a part of Los Angeles’ food truck craze and also meet stars from the reality show. With a range of styles, the trucks are sure to meet a variety of culinary needs. Grill ‘Em All continues in the competition, while the other food trucks were eliminated in past weeks. Their food truck endeavors continue, however, as shown by this meeting culinary minds.
“It’s gonna be fun,” Domingue said. “It’s like a little reunion.”
To read about all the contestants, visit www.foodnetwork.com/the-great-food-truck-race
Excited to see the trucks will be at the game and the comments by Mr. Domingue were great, but the reporter fails to mention that Crepes Bonaparte owner Christian Murcia is a fellow Trojan…class of 2008 graduate of Marshall School of Business. An unfortunate oversight and point well worth mentioning in the Daily Trojan.
