When I first heard about the Museum of Jurassic Technology, I envisioned a room filled with early tools used by humans or, since I don’t think humans were around in the Jurassic period, early tools used by dinosaurs. I definitely did not picture dead mice on toast, space dogs and a tribute to trailer parks.
I learned about the museum from Mr. Mullen, my high school history teacher. Naturally, since he was my favorite teacher, I visited the museum immediately, enthralled by its pure weirdness.
Since that first visit, I’ve frequently brought up MJT in conversations about things to do in L.A., just so I can rave about it. From USC, MJT is easily accessible by taking the Expo Line to Culver City.
Warning: this article contains spoilers. To maximize museum enjoyment, stop reading now and go visit without knowing what to expect.
If you must read on, bring friends who know nothing about the museum and watch their reactions. As bad as it sounds, I spent most of my second visit laughing at my friends’ confusion.
My friends quickly realized that the museum has no discernible connection to “Jurassic technology” and speculated its true purpose. After examining a horn that the museum claimed “grew from the back of a woman’s head,” they were convinced it was a “museum of lies.”
Nearby, a wall boasted a common beetle, next to a telephone.
“Am I supposed to talk to it?” asked my friend, Taylor.
Placards offer prattling descriptions, leaving patrons searching long blocks of text for information. My friend Jodee repeatedly questioned the placement of a sign reading “Portrait of a Woman,” seemingly placed with a video of a lemur eating berries.
Somehow, the museum has everything and nothing at the same time. There’s art — radiographic image of flowers. There’s theater — the Borque Theater Mechanics guide to making a man into a rock. There’s science — a graph demonstrating the various states of matter. But unlike other museums, there’s nothing of recognizable importance. There’s no Warhol, no dinosaur bones, no famous historical documents. Instead, the stuff is important because the museum says it is.
Lured by the promise of tea and cookies, we rushed upstairs before fully examining first floor.
The tearoom is quaint, classy, and most importantly, it makes sense, offering a sanctuary from the museum’s oddities. An accompanying outdoor courtyard features live music, majestic archways and caged doves. By this point, my friends were thoroughly confused, so the tearoom served as a place for them to recover from their frustration.
As we entered the upstairs section, we were greeted with imposing portraits of dogs in a curtained, candlelit room with a somber atmosphere. The portraits featured the fallen dogs of the Soviet space program, including “the famed Laika,” the first animal to orbit Earth.
Perhaps the museum’s strangest section, “Belief, Knowledge, and Hypersymbolic Condition” celebrates strange beliefs and old wives’ cures. The section is also educational; we learned that bedwetting can be cured by eating mice on toast, and sprinkling urine on family members on New Years Day is good luck.
My personal favorite exhibit, “Garden of Eden on Wheels,” showcases mobile homes, prestigiously dubbed “land arcs” by the museum. Belongings from Los Angeles-area trailers are displayed as prominently as a Van Gogh piece. The “Mary Elliot Collection” is exactly that: Mary Elliot’s personal porcelain collection.
The “Garden of Eden” exhibit signifies the essence of the museum as a whole, which presents the ordinary in an extraordinary light and makes the obscure appear prestigious.
It was only after thoroughly exploring the museum’s nooks and crannies that we watched the introductory slideshow. If the slideshow offered a clear explanation of the museum’s purpose, it could have served as an apt conclusion to our evening. Instead, my guests were left even more confused.
The museum is an “educational institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic.” But, we definitely did not leave the museum with enhanced knowledge of the Lower Jurassic, whatever that means.
The slideshow recounts the original meaning of museum as “a spot dedicated to the Muses, a place where man’s mind could attain a mood of aloofness above everyday affairs.” And from the dim lighting to the assorted exhibits, the MJT definitely exudes a mood of aloofness.
“So it’s a museum about museums,” concluded Taylor.
David and Diana Wilson founded the museum in 1988. It has since garnered a cult following, following mentions in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times. Approximately 25,000 people explore the museum’s curiosities each year.
If you’ve read this far, don’t worry — I’ve left many of these curiosities unrevealed, so you can discover them yourself. If you’re still unconvinced to visit, follow the museum’s own advice: “The learner must be led always from familiar objects toward the unfamiliar.” Take a step away from the familiar and into the Museum of Jurassic Technology.

Andy Warhol’s exhibition, “Shadows,” on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles from Sept. 20 to Feb. 15, is the first West Coast presentation of Warhol’s vast painting made up of 102 collective parts.
MOCA presents a rare opportunity to see the 102 canvases, silk-screened and hand-painted with distorted photographs of shadows, the way Warhol intended them to be seen: in their entirety. The exhibit in many ways embodies the same impersonality that makes up the artist’s volume of work.  Critics of the artist like Christopher Knight of the Los Angeles Times have interpreted the “overblown installation” as “vapid and pretentious.” Knight fails to value the depth of Warhol’s irony, however, mistaking it for mere shallowness.
The repetitive and mechanical nature of the 6-foot tall, 4-foot wide panels is a complete manifestation of Warhol’s ability to captivate consumer culture with a mass production of “impersonal” pop art. Comparable to his mid-’60s exhibition featuring sculptures nearly identical to Brillo soapboxes or his silk-screened soup cans, “Shadows” reflects the artist’s desire to provoke audiences into questioning what art is, exactly. In fact, the photographic source of the shadows continues to remain a mystery widely debated among art historians.
Warhol’s persona is alive and well in the exhibit.  Using the same indistinguishable subject over and over again and the detached technique of the silk-screen, Warhol captures the mind-numbing reality ubiquitous in much of the American post-World War II art movement.
“Shadows” is a departure from Warhol’s iconic silk-screens of famous portraits such as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor and his experimentation with abstraction. Similar to Warhol’s other abstract works, including “Camouflage,” “Oxidation” and “Rorschach,” “Shadows” could be seen as a mocking tribute to abstract expressionists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko.
While it is certainly a fantastic opportunity to see the complete collection of “Shadows,” MOCA’s exhibition space undermines the full potential of the painting.  The large set of canvases is divided among two large rooms that fragment them, creating a monotonous, underwhelming atmosphere. The gallery places a great deal of thought into the selection of work from the museum’s permanent collection adjacent to the exhibit titled “Concrete Infinity.” The purpose of “Concrete Infinity” is to take viewers into the alluring, dark corners of Warhol’s “Shadows” aiming to conjure thoughts of “dancing bodies, ecstasy, and social and sexual encounter.”
When “Shadows” was first displayed in SoHo’s Heiner Friedrich Gallery in 1979, the boldly monochromatic paintings featuring the artist’s signature hues — midnight blue, carmine red and chartreuse — caused one observer to write:
“The show only looks good because it’s so big.”
The observer happened to be Warhol himself; his self-deprecation reveals even more about the abstract concepts behind the paintings that Warhol described not as art, but rather as “disco decor.”
The enigmatic nature of the paintings combined with their flashy duo-color facades are, as Warhol believed, meant to furnish the walls of a nightclub like Studio 54 or play backdrop to a photo shoot.  It is true; for some reason the seemingly insipid paintings are able to evoke a glamorous ’70s atmosphere. One cannot help but imagine themselves in a dimly lit club, filled with strung out models and enveloped by walls covered with “Shadows.” On their own, the paintings do not stand out for any clear uniqueness or meaning, but when you indulge in a mini photo shoot in front of them along with friends, you’ll have realized Warhol’s sardonic intent.

Last week, Duke University initially ruled that its historic chapel bell would be used for the call to Muslim prayer, or adhan, on Fridays. After pressure from evangelical influences, the university has since reversed course and will not allow the chapel to be used for the call to prayer. Prayers will still be held in the basement of the chapel and in the courtyard.
Duke’s course of action and final decision to not allow the adhan to take place at the chapel demonstrates a lack of religious plurality in a setting that is home to a diverse population of students. Furthermore, the timing of the decision, coupled with recent global events, fosters an attitude and culture of exclusivity toward Islam. Providing a religious community with a safe location for practice is an important aspect of religious tolerance and helps to include all walks of life on campus. The decision to not allow the call to prayer raises the question — what if it were a Christian call to prayer? Would a similar decision stand? Or if it were Jewish, Hindu or Buddhist? The decision against the adhan connotes prejudice and gives no compassion to the roughly 700 Muslim students on Duke’s campus. The bell now exclusively rings twice on Sundays, reverting to the university’s original plan, in observance of the Christian day of rest. Allowing religious prayers to take place on campus is a positive sign toward acceptance and a realization of the rights of others. Failing to give those of another religion the same treatment and respect is discriminatory and dishonest.
Duke has religious roots in the United Methodist Church but now prides itself on being unaffiliated with religion. If there is openness to all religions, then there is no reason to discredit the inclusion of a Muslim call to prayer. After the tragic attacks at the Charlie Hebdo headquarters in France and a common stigma toward Islam in general for the better part of a century, it is important to illustrate the acceptance of Muslims and not define Islam by extremists or radicals. Rather than currying favor with evangelical Christians or a complacent majority, Duke should have stood in the face of the Charlie Hebdo attacks and fought for religious pluralism, recognizing that the tragedy was the works of fanaticals and not Islam itself. It was never a more appropriate time to wield the power of acceptance. In an increasingly cynical world rife with ignorance, hatred and intolerance, the important and strategic action should be to open pluralism, acceptance and compassion. Duke only added insult to injury by initially ruling in favor of the adhan, only to reverse the action a couple days later. The university’s hesitancy and apprehension is an indication of the lack of confidence and belief in the multiplicity and diversity of the student population. Reversing the decision was in poor taste, and the Duke administration failed to remain cognizant of the long-term precedents it sets toward minority groups.
It is important in today’s world that ignorance be shed in order to begin to understand the world around us. Duke’s actions send the message that it does not accept those who do not fit its mold. Tolerance, and more importantly, an appreciation of different religions and cultures is at the forefront of attaining an equitable and all-inclusive society.
Allowing the adhan is not a sign of America succumbing to foreign powers. It’s an indication of America’s diversity, respect and inclusion of a variety of backgrounds and origins. It’s America’s unique distinction rooted in a melting pot of immigrants that makes it a land of opportunity for all.

I am convinced that the regressive, extremist interpretation of Islam has
turned us into a backward, perverse society. We repress our dark urges but they
find their outlet in frustration, jealousy, hatred, terrorism and the desire to
destroy the West. While the Islamic Paradise is sexual and permissive, it
cannot be attained through normal means because it is conditioned on death and
on killing innocent victims. The truth is that Paradise really does exist, but
only in the West. This is evident to any shepherd in the Middle East who has
access to a generator, a television set and a satellite dish.
The culture gap is frustrating and leads to a strong desire to copy the West
and even belong to it; but it also leads to a destructive envy of the West by
the radical Islamic ideologues, who hate music, dancing, democracy, Western
society, pluralism and the pleasures of this world.
It is hard to judge what goes on in the mind of a Muslim who, every Friday,
listens to the nonsense propounded by the Imam about jahiliyya and the
West. I am certain that the conflict leads every observant Muslim like myself
to feel a deep envy leading him to hate himself and the West, its progress and
achievements. The knowledge that, apart from the Holy Qur’an, we have not
contributed anything to the progress of mankind, beyond a collection of wars
and terrorist attacks, frustrates and depresses many of us. An internal
conflict grows as we realize that we are more than one billion strong, and that
we possess an enormous amount of the geography of the world, its fresh water,
its oil and its riches, but that to the world at large, we represent
backwardness and violence, and that the excuses of our leaders are couched in
empty, anachronistic terms such as “Western imperialism and
colonialism.”
How many church bells do you hear in Riyadh? Which religious group is burning churches and killing members of other religions? So don’t start spouting off about Duke, which was founded by Methodists, not being tolerant to the muslim religion. Get a life and get a clue. If the muslim students don’t like it then let them transfer to USC and let them adhan all they want.

On Jan. 15, Academy Award nominations for various film achievements were announced. During these announcements, the staggering lack of diversity, particularly in the acting and directing categories, was apparent.
As the list of nominees was read, a big question mark was put on the Oscar, an award that supposedly recognizes people, regardless of their race, for the contributions they have made to the world of cinema. In a year that produced monumental films such as Selma, a biopic about Martin Luther King, Jr., the Academy’s neglect of color reveals that criticism of the awards is deserved and that there is a need for new membership in the Academy.
Liliana Sedano | Daily Trojan
According to The Hollywood Reporter, this is the second time in nearly two decades that the 20 acting nominations went to a group of exclusively Caucasian actors and actresses. A similar nominee list occurred in 2011. Unfortunately, a homogenous group of people nominated for an Academy Award is not a new revelation, but it needs to be remedied.
The lack of diversity in nominations might have something to do with the Academy’s membership. The Atlantic states that out of the 6,000 voting members of the Academy, 94 percent are white, 76 percent are male, and the average age is 63.
This means that the membership might not reflect the critical acclaim of the year, leaving out a David Oyelowo for playing King in Selma or a Miyavi, who played a prison guard in Unbroken. Rather than plainly accept that Academy voters leave out actors who demonstrate great acting ability, audiences everywhere have to support actors of color and watch their movies to generate buzz, creating a conversation about why that particular film is essential. The Academy, in conjunction with audiences voicing their opinions, has to invite more than just white males into its demographic.
This Monday marked the annual celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Even in the contemporary world, King’s “I Have a Dream” speech can leave anybody with goose bumps. The way King describes a dream, his dream of a world where equality exists with no place for bias, discrimination and injustice, was revolutionary for his time. But the recent Oscar nominations have done nothing to contribute to this dream and, instead, have taken this world a step back by exhibiting a lack of diversity at such a grand level. This started with the absence of Oyelowo from the acting nominations.
That Selma was ignored is significant but the issue is even bigger than that. The American film industry is often looked upon by other countries as the dominating force. It embodies a paradigm of morality, integrity and justice, all while producing the most cutting-edge material. Therefore, every action that the film industry in this country takes is likely to set an example and have an impact on almost all the other film industries in the world. A lack of judgment in choosing nominations for such a prestigious award represents more than just a careless mistake.
Some argue that this year’s Oscar nominations are nothing but a coincidence. As an article in The New York Times pointed out, one could assume that last year’s Best Picture winner, 12 Years a Slave, 2012 Best Picture nominee The Help and 2013 Best Picture nominee Django Unchained are examples of films embracing more of a diverse population.
In the last few years, however, examples of movies that celebrate race and document hardships that people of color have experienced stop there. So, more than anything, there needs to be a collective effort to get these stories out. More funding, especially, should be allocated to these film efforts.
The dream is for the Academy to recognize the actors that deserve an Oscar. The dream is for the Academy to represent more than what a 63-year-old white male deems best in show.

EdMonth is a monthlong program at USC dedicated to raising awareness about the state of education in the United States. It will be hosting an event every Thursday from now until March to spark conversation about education on campus. The EdMonth theme this year is “Spark a Movement — from Classroom to Community.” The executive board hopes to bridge the gap between USC and the local community with its creative new plans for this year.
“It’s an annual tradition at USC and it started three years ago by a group of students in USC Program Board,” said Hannah Nguyen, the Executive Director of EdMonth. “It’s meant to empower [students] to become advocates for educational justice no matter what they go on to do in their lives.”
The first EdMonth only consisted of about five speaker events, in which students came to listen to educational leaders. The program has gained momentum over the past three years and the board plans to further the original mission of EdMonth while bringing more variety to their events this year. There will be more than 15 events in March, including the annual kick-off panel and a new signature event, an outdoor arts in education festival.
The arts festival will be EdMonth’s first physical exhibit. It will bring the work of more than 500 local students to the University Park campus and emphasize the value of arts and creativity in the U.S. educational system.
EdMonth has already hosted events such as “The Danger of Silence: An Evening with Clint Smith” at Ground Zero last Wednesday. Clint Smith spoke on his experiences as a teacher and advocated for the importance of youth empowerment, especially during the Black Lives Matter movement. The first seminar, DebatED, was also held last week. It consisted of a panel discussion about Teach for America featuring Dr. Julian Vasquez Heilig. Other EdMonth seminars that are part of the EngagED series will be taking place every Thursday until March.
The EdMonth board members plan on stressing student and community voices this year since they believed there was not enough local community presence in previous years. The board is striving to expand the EdMonth program each year with more speakers and larger events.
The program’s board has been working to expand the promotion of EdMonth to attract more people’s attention. Nguyen ahopes that their events before and during the month of March will stimulate ongoing conversation about the political and social issues surrounding education today.
“We want this to be a place where the community voice can be elevated,” Nguyen said. “So many students here at USC go to work or volunteer with the community and local students through JEP and other programs. We want to service a lens into that community to help people better understand the conditions of schools and empower them to further education and be a part of the movement.”

The Dept. of Public Safety released an update for the mobile safety application LiveSafe. The update, which took effect last Tuesday, allows students to call Campus Cruiser through the interface.
The SafeWalk feature that allows students to input their destination so that friends can track each other on a map has also been updated. Now friends can request a SafeWalk for someone else. The update should occur automatically on both Apple and Android devices.
The app still allows people to report emergencies and send tips about safety hazards using text messages, photos and video but now when people open the app the icon that used to be labeled SafeWalk is called StaySafe.
If students launch the StaySafe feature they can call campus cruiser or start a SafeWalk.
The app, customized for USC, was made available to all students, faculty and staff in November and there have been 4,700 downloads since, according to Jill Frater, business continuity specialist at USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning. The SafeWalk feature has been used 903 times.
“In speaking with the vendor of LiveSafe they’ve said we’ve done probably a better job than other universities in terms of the number of users downloading it after launch,” Frater said.
But DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said outreach is very much an ongoing process, and the department has a long way to go toward reaching its goal of every student, faculty member and staff member downloading the app.
“Last week I spoke to a large group of incoming grad students both at the University Park Campus and the Health Science Campus.” Carlisle said.
He added that community outreach officers have also gone to the private housing developments including the Lorenzo and University Gateway Apartments and spoken about including LiveSafe information in leasing information packets.
Some students including second-year global communications graduate student  Shijia Ouyang said as an international student from China, safety is a big concern, especially since the murders of Chinese nationals Ming Qu and Ying Wu in 2012 and Xinran Ji over the summer.
“I went to a lecture for international students where they told me they would develop an app in the future,” Ouyang said.  “I received the email [about the app] so I downloaded it but actually I don’t know how to use it. I wish I could find some instruction.”
Becky Teper, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she’d heard of the app but hadn’t downloaded it because she didn’t know enough about it to feel comfortable using it.
“I would consider getting it but I would have to see what the features were first,” Teper said. “I definitely think it will be effective in targeting students.  Most students have smartphones so it’s a good way for them to communicate with DPS.”
DPS Communications Supervisor Sandra Young said a large amount of activity that occurred in the month following the launch was students testing the app to see how the features worked, something the department encouraged.
“We haven’t received any type of priority one, which is emergency-type calls,” Young said.  “Last month it was more geared toward maintenance or service issues like people being locked out or people reporting anything they think is suspicious.”
DPS received 93 communications through the app in December, Young said.
Frater said there has been a great deal of feedback and helpful suggestions so far.
“We want to reach out whenever and wherever we can,” she said. “We want to continue to make it better and we want to continue to get that feedback.”

Undergraduate Student Government Commuter Senators shared progress on their proposal to create a lounge for commuter students on campus at the weekly Senate meeting Tuesday night.
The proposal, drafted in conjunction with the University Affairs branch of USG, was spearheaded by Commuter Senators Michael Johnson, Hayden Smith, and Brianna Thorpe.
“When you come to USC as a commuter, there’s no place to just relax and decompress between classes,” Smith said. “Although the libraries are there, it would be helpful to have a place that could also be used a social space to interact with other commuter students.”
According to the commuter senators, students who commute to campus daily often feel overlooked by peers and administration and disconnected from the larger university community. Long gaps between morning classes and evening classes can pose a problem for commuter students who have no place to go on campus between those times. The proposed commuter lounge would serve as a practical gathering place for these students.
The commuter senators hope that the lounge will benefit their constituents by increasing connectivity to campus and also providing a place for commuters to meet each other. The Senators plan for the space to have a microwave, refrigerator, lockers, computers and printers, as well as couches and televisions to facilitate a social atmosphere. The lounge would also feature monitors with campus news and traffic updates.
“The lockers would be beneficial,” Johnson said in a statement. “Commuter students are at a real disadvantage if they forget any materials at home. Residential or Greek students can run across the street and secure what they forgot, while we must either travel home in L.A. traffic and miss class or continue through our day unprepared.”
Smith first proposed the idea of creating a commuter lounge last April as a part of his campaign platform. During the last semester, the commuter senators collected feedback for the project from their constituents through social media and by tabling on campus.
According to the commuter senators, other top colleges such as Yale University, Duke University, New York University, Northwestern University, American University and Brandeis University have dedicated on-campus spaces for commuter students.
According to the senators, the exact number of commuter students is unknown and largely undisclosed by university officials.
“Every number we get is different … It’s sad that there isn’t clear evidence of commuter students’ impact on this campus. I think it is a indication of the lack of inclusivity for commuter students,” Thorpe said.
In order to minimize costs, the commuter senators expressed interest in utilizing existing campus resources to create the lounge space — specifically in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Smith and Thorpe stated that they had plans to meet with the director of the Tutor Campus Center in order to identify a possible room for the lounge. Until the Commuter Lounge space is designated, the commuter senators plan to create a resource guide that identifies locations on campus where students who commute can rest between classes.
Thirty-one percent of those surveyed reported a commute time of more than an hour. According to the commuter senators, the lengthy commute times do not necessarily mean that the student lives far from campus, but instead that traffic is heavy during their commutes. Of the 112 students surveyed, 104 reported commuting during rush hour periods. Nearly all of the students claimed that a commuter lounge would allow them to stay on campus longer during the day.
The senators also expressed concern about parking on campus for commuter students.
“It’s a problem when you come to campus, and then you go to your designated structure where you pay over $400 a semester to park, and there are no available spaces for you,” Smith said.
The limited availability of parking adds time to commutes and often causes commuters to get ticketed for parking improperly in order to get to class on time. Smith expressed interest in utilizing Park Assist technology like what has been used near the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica to alleviate traffic around campus.
As the senators’ terms come to an end in several weeks, the senators expressed hope that their successors will continue to move forward with the commuter lounge project.
“It would be extremely useful to get more user feedback … The one thing that people listen to is data because it show that what we are saying is not made up. It’s not just a personal anecdote. It’s a real problem,” Smith said.
I think this is a great idea. I commute from Fountain Valley and spend nearly 3.5-4 hours a day sitting in traffic. I would like to have a place to store books, jackets, snacks etc. I also find it ridiculous that I have to pay $1,000 a year to park in full parking structures.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics held a viewing and panel discussion of the State of the Union attended by about 250 people at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Tuesday night.
President Barack Obama began his speech looking back at the past 15 years that ravaged the nation with wars and a crippling recession.
“But tonight, we turn the page,” Obama said.
In the introduction, he outlined the nation’s improvement to a range of topics, such as the economy and education citing the best college graduation rate the nation has ever witnessed.
In his speech that focused on pushing for a progressively liberal economic agenda, Obama said this may be the first time in years that college students may feel confident in graduating and joining the workforce.
The president’s address also focused on the end of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the responsible actions that should be taken in order for armed conflicts to be a measure of last resort.
“When we make rash decisions — reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads — when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts,” Obama said.
The president also prompted the legislature to lift the ban on the Cuba embargo.
“When what you’re doing doesn’t work for 50 years, it’s time to try something new,” he said.
The panel for the discussion following the president’s address included Jessica Yellin, a former chief White House correspondent for CNN; Professor Robert Shrum, the Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics; Sarah Dhanaphatana, Daily Trojan assistant city editor; and Daniel Rothberg, former Daily Trojan managing editor.
The panel, mediated by the executive director of the Unruh Institute of Politics Dan Schnur, touched on topics ranging from the meaning of the color of the ties worn by Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner to the likely Republican reaction to the speech.
The speech demonstrated to be emotionally charged focusing on the positive State of the Union but also rallied for both sides of the aisle to work together on issues that have affected the majority of Americans.
“He hit the emotional high notes that can rally his base and remind people why he was elected,” Yellin said.
“It was a great opportunity for the president to talk about all of the great things he has accomplished and to describe all of the things that are on his agenda for this coming year and at the same time, he addressed working on both sides of the aisle,” said Andrew Menard, Undergraduate Student Government president.
Obama also discussed the recent proposal to make community college tuition free for students who maintain good grades and graduate on time.
“I agree with that,” said Menard referring to the president’s proposal on free tuition for community colleges. “At the same time, I think it needs to be done responsibly, which is what Congress will challenge him on.  I would like to see a plan passed that makes the most sense,” Menard said.  He stressed that education for as many Americans as possible would make a positive change.
Though the specific details of the plan have yet to be released, students at the event voiced opinions about the proposal.
“He should extend that and include a plan for university students as well,” said Sarah Collins,  a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and political science.
“He did mention that 40 percent of people go to community college but there is also a need for students working towards their bachelor’s degrees.  So I think the next step, if this were to get passed, is to focus on tuition rates for school systems like the UC’s.
The reaction of the republican-led legislature is expected to be as aggressive as the speech.
“I think for the most part, they’re going to keep on doing what they’re doing,” Collins said of the stalemate Congress has been in for the last few years. “Everything he said, the Republicans will at least partially criticize,” she said.
Professor Shrum described how after the president laid out his agenda, he spoke for the whole country. “He spoke about values,” Shrum said .
“We’ve laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let’s begin this new chapter together and let’s start the work right now,” the President concluded.
I figured the panel would have a liberal bias. Not open minded at all.

The presidential tickets for 2015-2016 Undergraduate Student Government officially announced their candidacies on Wednesday at midnight.
The tickets are as follows: current USG Vice President Rini Sampath and current USG Director of University Affairs Jordan Fowler; current USG Greek Senator Providence Illisevich and former Interfraternity Council Executive Vice President of Administrative Affairs Ehren Elder; and Devon Manny and Sharon Oh, sophomores majoring in animation and digital art.
The candidates all hold a diverse array of platform points, spanning from improving library hours to implementing a university fall break.
Some of Sampath’s and Fowler’s platform points advocate for the implementation of fall housing for spring admits, a mental health awareness campaign and improved campus disability access. Illisevich’s and Elder’s platform advocate extended dining hall hours on campus, improving campus sustainability efforts and extending class drop deadlines, among others. Manny and Oh, the only ticket with no previous USG affiliation, are campaigning on abolishing or minimizing the fraternity system, reducing USG and USC expenditures and having “dogs on campus at ALL [sic] times.”
All the candidates endorse improvements to the school’s current sexual assault policy, with Sampath and Fowler and Illisevich and Elder overlapping on issues such as improved disability access and expanding campus mental health resources.
Additionally, the senatorial positions were announced. The official candidates for Greek Senator are Sanjay Mahboobani, Chris Fong, Darian Nourian, Sean Salisbury and Ricky Oakley. Those for residential senator are Aaron Rifkind, Eric Dubbury, Giuseppe Robalino, Sabrina Enriquez, Rhea Lafleur, Dan Li and Alec White. Commuter senator candidates are Cassandra Aguayo, Bulk Lao and Jacob Ellenhorn.
Jan. 21 marks the beginning of a month-long campaign window for the USG presidential, vice presidential and senatorial candidates. Physical campaigning will officially begin on Feb. 3., with elections running from Feb. 10 through Feb. 12.
Candidates will be restricted from distributing physical materials and can only campaign through meetings with recognized student organizations, according to the 2015 USG election codes.
Christine Hennes, USG senior director of communications, shared that the organization has been planning for the elections since last spring, and they are anticipating a heavily contested campaign from all sides.
“The presidential candidates are all extremely qualified, and we really want to see how the election unfolds,” she said. “It’s going to be a very competitive race.”
Editor’s note: Darian Nourian, a candidate for Greek senator, is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan.

I’m thinking of a number between one and 10. Can you guess what it is by the end of this column?
I’ll give you a hint: it’s the number of teams I think should be included in the College Football Playoff format. A week after the CFP’s first season, it’s time to look back on how well it worked, what didn’t work and if any changes will come to the format in the future.
To start off, let’s assume that I’m only talking about even numbers. Organizing a single elimination playoff tournament with an odd number of teams wouldn’t make much sense.
We can also assume I’m not talking about two, seeing as we’re still talking about some sort of a playoff. Sure, the old BCS system put together some great championship game matchups but I don’t think there’s a single college football fan who wants the old way back.
Can you imagine the problem such a format would have caused this year? Between five one-loss teams and one undefeated team, only two could have been selected to play for the national championship. Would an unbeaten, defending national champion team in Florida State have been left out for two one-loss teams? Would Alabama, the powerhouse of the new millennium, be left out because of one conference loss? Would Oregon’s smashing of Arizona in the Pac-12 title game still not have been enough to make up for the narrow loss to the Wildcats earlier in the season?
It’s impossible to guess how exactly it would have played out, but at least one of those three that absolutely deserved to still be playing would have been left out. The Oregon team that dominated FSU in the Rose Bowl semifinal game likely would have been left out, the championship game would have likely matched up two teams that lost in their semifinals and the Ohio State team that won it all almost certainly would not have been included in the final.
Two is just not enough teams to capture everyone who can legitimately claim being the best team in the country. Plus, everybody likes the excitement of the additional playoff games, and any changes certainly won’t result in less TV time.
So how about four? We saw two perfectly interesting semifinal games and a very exciting title game matchup. To the excitement of any CFP selection committee member, the last team given an invitation to the playoff proved to be very deserving by winning it all. The regular season was still one of the most exciting ever, as any regular season loss seemed like it could knock a team out of the playoff, but the expanded format  got even more teams to be involved in the drama.
But there were problems with the four-team format. Both of them came from the Big 12.
TCU and Baylor were both perfectly qualified to take the fourth playoff spot. TCU’s one loss to Baylor didn’t look as bad as Ohio State’s to Virginia Tech, and Baylor’s signature regular season win over TCU looked better than Ohio State’s over Michigan State. But the lack of a Big 12 conference title game forced TCU and Baylor to settle as co-champions of the conference, while Ohio State smashed Wisconsin in the Big 10 title game. Both Big 12 teams were arguably better than Ohio State, but neither could separate well enough to claim to fourth and final spot.
It’s not shocking that there was some controversy with a playoff format that invites four teams from five major conferences to play for the national championship. There’s almost guaranteed to be a qualified but left out conference champion from the bunch. Could TCU or Baylor have upset Alabama and Oregon en route to an unforgettable national title? Absolutely, but instead of playing that scenario out on the field, Horned Frogs and Bears fans will just have to play it over and over again in their head.
Well then, why not bump the playoff number to eight? That seems to be the logical and popular next step. The playoff games were amazing, wouldn’t more of them be even more amazing? And with more teams, the better we know who the real national champion is, right? I would disagree on both accounts.
Yes, the playoffs are awesome, so  much more so than the old bowl system. But an eight-team playoff would have totally changed the excitement level of this season. As mentioned above, every regular season game involving a playoff contender felt like it could have made or broken that team’s playoff resume.
When Alabama lost to Ole Miss, I thought the state of Mississippi was sure to have the SEC’s representative in the Top 4. Alabama ultimately climbed back into the Top 4, but there was no doubt the Rebels had spoiled the dream season of in-state rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl on the last game of the regular season by handing the Bulldogs their second loss and knocking them out of playoff contention. When Michigan State took on Oregon and Ohio State, it felt like the winner was set for the playoff and the loser was set for a random bowl game. During the TCU-Baylor shootout, you knew the last team standing would be in perfect position to claim a spot and the loser have a very hard time recovering.
Of course, not all of those wins or loses turned out to be make-or-break. Alabama still made it after a high-profile loss; Baylor still missed out after a high-profile win. But the important part is that all of that was up in the air going into those games, and an eight-team playoff would have provided too much margin for error. Ole Miss wouldn’t have spoiled Mississippi State’s playoff hopes. The TCU-Baylor game would have felt like a battle for a better seed, not for an actual playoff spot.
Not only do eight teams dilute the regular season too much, but the added round of playoffs and extra teams competing in the playoff also increases the chances that some team other than the best team in the nation wins the national championship. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Any team can beat any other team on any given day, and upsets are what make sports fun.
But I think there should be some value in what’s earned over the course of an entire 12-game or 13-game season, not just a couple postseason games or even in one fluke upset. There’s no disputing that Ohio State deserves the national championship after beating two powerhouses in the playoff, but I’m not convinced that the Buckeyes were the best team in college football last year. If we could simulate those playoffs again 100 times, I think Ohio State would win less than 25 times.
Given the final CFP selection committee rankings, a two-loss Mississippi State and Michigan State team would have been added to the mix. Could anyone in their right mind argue that based off of their regular season performance, the Spartans or Bulldogs could legitimately be considered the best team in the country?
Again, maybe a system that encourages results like that is good. But I personally would be more excited about two dynastic, heavyweights going at it most years and really settling who was the best in the country.
So that leaves us with the number six. If four is not enough, but eight is too much, the logical next step would be right in between. In theory, this plan would have worked absolutely perfectly this year.
The top two teams in the ranking would get a bye in the first round of playoffs. The fourth-ranked and fifth-ranked team would go at it in the afternoon then the third-ranked and sixth-ranked team would battle in the nightcap. These games would substitute for the two former BCS bowls that wouldn’t be in the four-team playoff rotation — the Orange and Fiesta Bowls this year. These “wildcard” rounds would have to happen a week before the semifinals on New Years Day, but the NCAA should have no problem finding some TV time during the preliminary bowl season — heck, they could even capitalize on another major holiday and schedule both for Christmas Day!
The semifinal and final could then fall on the same days they did this year. Student-athletes’ seasons wouldn’t last any longer, they just wouldn’t have any sort of a winter break. Fans would get extra excitement, the top two teams would earn the advantage of a bye, there’d be less controversy over the selection and the regular season would be just as exciting.
With the current conference alignment, there will always be at least five teams from one of the major conferences claiming to be the best in the nation — and it became abundantly clear that the Big 12 needs to figure out a conference championship game. The sixth spot opens up the possibility that a mid-major underdog could hypothetically sneak into the playoff.
The Power Five conference championships would then become de facto playoff games, even more than they are now — a key point people pushing for eight teams should remember. Basically, everything would be settled on the field, with the exception of that final sixth spot. This year, the extra spot would have just gone to another Big 12 team, and the CFP could have perfectly reasonably ranked Baylor and TCU fourth and fifth to set up a crazy playoff rematch. Ohio State could have carried out the dismantling of FSU, the Big 12 winner could have given Oregon a real game, Cardale Jones’ I-Only-Play-in-Big-Games story would have had one extra chapter going into the Alabama game and it would have been the greatest college sports experience ever.
We could eventually see conference realignment where each conference gets one automatic bid to a playoff, and the recent Power Five conference vote on stipends shows there’s more to come on the power/money balance between the NCAA — could the Power Fives secede from the NCAA? That would all take much longer than one year, though you heard it here first if Boise State and Notre Dame join the Big 12 in the near future to make it big enough to split into two divisions.
Ultimately, the CFP was a great success in its first year, far superior to its predecessor. Commercialized expansion is bound to happen at some point, but because the current system really does work  well, moderation during expansion is crucial.

With expectations set high, USC women’s water polo star Monica Vavic is already off to a hot start in her final season with the program.
The senior was named the MPSF Player of the Week for the fourth time in her career on Tuesday, following her stellar play in the pool this past week.
The 5’8’’ driver out of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, netted a career-high eight goals in USC’s blowout 33-5 victory over Cal State Bakersfield on Jan. 17 at the UCLA Invitational.
The eight goals are the most goals scored by an MPSF player since 2007 and most by a USC player in more than a decade when Aniko Pelle accomplished the same feat.
She then followed that personal record-setting performance with six goals in the Women of Troy’s 24-3 win over Cal Baptist. With her 14 total goals to kick of the year, Vavic moved up to No. 6 all-time in career goals with 205 during her time with the program.
Her brother, Nikola, currently holds the all-time goal scoring record for the USC men’s water polo program with 254 career goals.
Vavic not only scored goals this past weekend,  but also served as a facilitator, dishing out eight assists in the two wins. She added to her standout performance on the offensive side of the ball by posting seven steals on defense in only five periods of play.
With that, Vavic’s team is currently undefeated at 2-0 as they move on to play in a variety of tournaments and matches throughout California, Hawaii and Arizona during the spring season.
After starting the season on a high note, one can find Vavic and her fellow Women of Troy teammates in the water starting again next month, Feb. 7-8, when the team travels to La Jolla, California, to participate in the Triton Invitational.

While many of his teammates already declared for the NFL draft, senior linebacker J.R. Tavai took one more opportunity to impress NFL scouts. Tavai played at the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl at the StubHub Center on Jan. 17.
The NFLPA Collegiate Bowl is an opportunity for players of all schools, as it joins them in one game to show scouts their potential. Tavai was the only Trojan to play in the game this year. Redshirt senior tight end Randall Telfer was invited to the event but was unable to play due to an injury during the Trojans’ Holiday Bowl victory over Nebraska. Telfer is rehabbing until pro day and the Combine.
Tavai’s name was announced several times for key tackles Saturday. He moved to outside linebacker in his junior year after playing on the line his first two seasons. Tavai finished out his last two years with 109 tackles, 21.5 for losses. He led the team in tackles for losses his senior season with 13.5.
Tavai said he felt good about the week and his NFL status.
“The whole process was great,” Tavai said. “I had a week of good practice. I learned a lot from new coaches. The whole NFLPA thing was an honor to play in. I had fun out here [and] got to meet some guys I played against. It has just been a great experience. I got to meet some scouts, too. The whole process was just tough. Overall, it was just a great experience and I’m thankful for the opportunity.”
Tavai demonstrated his versatility in the game, playing on the punt team and the defense.
“Overall, I think I did all right,” Tavai said. “I think I can work on some things.”
Playing and practicing multiple positions this week, Tavai emphasized one lesson he has learned throughout his time at USC.
“Overall, I just learned to adapt again. That’s something that I’m good at and that’s something that it takes to [be in] the NFL,” Tavai said.
Along with his power and relative quickness, scouts emphasized his will and motivation as his strengths. When Tavai was being recruited out of high school, Pete Caroll was the coach of the USC program at the time. Since then, three more head coaches have come and two have gone. Tavai felt the full force of the NCAA sanctions put on the school, and the reduction of scholarships has forced Tavai to use his skills at a variety of positions.
“In a program that was on probation for a little bit, we had different coaches, but I adapted, and I thought I had a successful career in college,” Tavai said. “Right now I’m gonna focus on the NFL, I’m gonna focus on the combine and pro day and I’m gonna go from there.”
Though USC has encountered adversity these past few years, the program may still be seen as beneficial when it comes to producing NFL players. Tavai sees the frequency of USC players to the NFL as an an advantage.
To make it to the NFL, Tavai will have to overcome his weaknesses, one of which scouts say is his history of injuries in college. He has had to sit out part of every year with injuries, including a hamstring strain, ankle sprain and broken foot. Nonetheless, Tavai believes his strengths outnumber his flaws.
“I’m not going to look at that, that way I guess,” Tavai said. “I have a lot more strengths than I do have weaknesses. I’m adaptive, I’m strong at the edge and I can set the edge. I’m very physical and if a team chooses me I’m gonna work hard to help them win a championship.”
Despite four losses in the 2014 season, two of which came when the team held a lead in the final minute, Tavai maintains that it was a successful season.
“It was a winning season,” Tavai said. “I’m glad I played with the band of brothers for one last game in San Diego. Opportunities come little, so the ones that come you have to take. The NFLPA game was a great opportunity just like the Holiday Bowl and I’m thankful for it.”
The Holiday Bowl may have been memorable for Tavai, but it was not his favorite moment of the season.
“[My favorite game of the season was] probably the Stanford game,” Tavai said. “I remember making a sack and just seeing everyone on the sideline jumping up for joy. That’s when I knew we had a good team and we could go from the stars from there. Unfortunately, we had some bumps and bruises at the end but that’s going to help the future.”
The moment Tavai is referring to is when he forced a fumble against Stanford in the final minute of the game to seal a key early season road victory. But as Tavai said, there were some struggles from that point until the end of the season. Despite these bumps and bruises, Tavai believes the future is bright at USC.
“Coach Sark’s gonna do a great job helping the team to work harder for a championship,” Tavai said. “Coach Sark came in with a new squad, new scheme, and he came in with aspirations for us. We definitely answered. We had fun. We had a group of guys that were new, some freshmen that came in and started. Overall, Sark was a great coach and is going to help that program a lot in the future.”

The USC women’s basketball team traveled to Westwood on Sunday to take on rival UCLA. They fell to the Bruins 71-60, and their record is now 11-6, 3-3.
The Women of Troy got off to a strong start against the Bruins, but UCLA seized the game behind a strong second-half effort, sending USC to a loss at Pauley Pavilion.
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama led the Women of Troy with 17 points and 12 rebounds for her fourth career double-double. Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert added 12 points, while senior forward Kaneisha Horn fell just shy of a double-double with 9 points and 10 rebounds.
UCLA’s Kari Korver led all scorers with 23 points. Nirra Fields finished with 14 points and nine rebounds, while Jordin Canada added 15 points and 6 rebounds, all in the second half.
“It was a tale of two halves,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “UCLA came to play the second half, and USC didn’t. We rebounded well in the first half, executed in the first half, played with a lot of intensity, and in the second half, I thought we were unfocused. UCLA got some momentum going and made some big plays down the stretch.”
The atmosphere was what can be expected of a crosstown rivalry game, with fans cheering on their teams and both sides giving it their all. The Women of Troy, looking for vengeance after suffering a 59-52 loss to the Bruins at the Galen Center, came out strong, jumping out to an early lead and managing to hold onto it despite constant pressure from UCLA. The Bruins only led for 45 seconds in the first half, as USC took a 32-26 lead heading into halftime.
Vaioletama led all players with 13 points and 7 rebounds in the first half. Horn added 9 points and 8 rebounds for the Women of Troy. Korver led the Bruins with 9 points at the half, while Fields had 7 points and 4 rebounds. Both teams committed 10 fouls and 9 turnovers and had similar field-goal percentages (38 percent for USC, 31 percent for UCLA), but USC had a 26-18 edge on the boards, including 9-6 on the offensive glass. However, USC struggled from behind-the-arc, going 0-for-9 on three-point attempts, compared to 3-for-10 for UCLA.
“Like coach said, it was intensity,” Vaioletama said about the team’s first-half play. “For us, it was getting out on their three-point shooters, and us executing and attacking their defense and rebounding. That was a big key for us. They’re lengthy and they’re very athletic, but we needed to box out and rebound down the stretch and we didn’t.”
The second half was a completely different story, as UCLA came storming out from the opening whistle. Korver scored UCLA’s first 10 points to cut USC’s lead to 40-36 while the addition of Canada into the UCLA rotation helped provide a spark for the Bruins. After a first half featuring only two lead changes, the second half had five.
Junior guard Brianna Barrett hit two free throws to tie the game at 60 with 3:06 remaining and the game looked to be going back-and-forth until the final buzzer. The Bruins seized the momentum, putting USC away with an 11-0 run.
UCLA dominated the boards after halftime, grabbing 28 second-half rebounds to USC’s 16 and shot 47 percent from the field to USC’s 33 percent. While the Women of Troy were able to knock down a couple of 3s, they finished the game hitting only two of 19 attempts.
The Women of Troy will look to bounce back at home against California (12-5, 4-2 Pac-12) on Friday, Jan. 25 at 7 p.m. and No. 11 Stanford (13-5, 5-1 Pac-12). They will then go back on the road to take on No. 9 Oregon State (16-1, 6-0 Pac-12) in Corvallis on Thursday, Jan. 31 at 2:30 pm and Oregon (8-9, 1-5 Pac-12) on Saturday, Feb. 2 at 5 p.m. All games will be available on the Pac-12 Network.
