College-aged women today have to make many choices. Deciding how to prevent pregnancy is just one of them.
Many women choose to remain abstinent or use condoms alone. Women who decide to seek a birth control prescription have another choice to make: Which option is best?
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
The most popular method used by women in their teens and 20s is the birth control pill, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
Taken daily and typically about 92 percent effective, the pill uses progestin or an estrogen and progestin combination to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus to prevent sperm travel.
The pill works well for a lot of women, but it’s hardly the only option. There are more effective alternatives that women should be aware of.
College is crazy and hectic, and remembering to take a pill every day at a specific time is difficult. If a woman forgets to take her pill even once, or regularly takes it off-schedule, she greatly increases her chance of pregnancy without a backup method.
These alternative long-term methods provide peace of mind and ease of use.
Long-term birth control methods such as the intrauterine device, the implant and the shot last longer and require less maintenance than the pill — and they are 97-99 percent effective.
The shot, known as Depo-Provera, is a progestin-only method that works the same way as the pill. The upside is that a woman only needs one shot every three months to prevent pregnancy. It costs about $75 without insurance.
The birth control implant is a small rod inserted under the skin in the upper arm. It slowly releases hormones that prevent pregnancy for a whopping three years. The rod is around the size of a match and can be removed anytime if a woman wants to become pregnant. It costs about $600 without insurance.
Lastly, the IUD provides pregnancy protection for five to 12 years and is inserted into the uterus right above the cervix. Mirena utilizes hormones and Paragard is hormone-free. The ability to become pregnant returns quickly if someone decides to get the IUD removed early. IUDs can be expensive without insurance, but they can last years — a definite perk.
Both the birth control implant and IUDs must be inserted and removed by a physician.
While we have introduced many contraceptive options for women, talk to your healthcare provider for more information to decide what is best for you.
Having sex comes with great responsibility. Choosing a birth control option is only part of that. Know the basics and ask for details. Be aware of the longer-term options available for women today.

You might want to think twice about putting forth Depo-Provera as a viable birth control method. It can result in severe side effects both while taking and coming off the drug. This blog post at re: Cycling provides links to women’s complaints about the drug, and a paper questioning it’s impact on young women’s health and well-being.

Just something else to keep in mind is, while these options might be more pricy up front, the cost per day might be cheaper then the pill or other birth control options.  Personally, I know that is the case with my IUD and one of the reasons I chose it.  However, it all comes down to what you are comfortable with and works for you. :)

Honors designations are unfair to transfer students.
If you are a graduating transfer student with a 3.7 GPA and you’re thinking of leaving with magna cum laude honors, think again.
Upon transferring, you are led to believe that you have been issued a blank slate. The separation of transfer GPA and USC GPA is understandable, since you are no longer a student of the previous institution.
But issues arise when the school decides to factor in your transfer GPA when determining honors assignment at graduation.
When determining honors status, the university takes into account the average of students’ residence work attempted and the combined transferred and residence work attempted. The honors award is then determined by the lower of the GPAs.
Students that transfer in with a lower GPA but boast a higher GPA while attending USC have the most to lose. If the university is trying to prevent transfer credits from providing an unfair GPA boost, why should it allow transfer credits to unfairly damage one’s GPA?
A revision in policy is needed. Though some may argue that transfer students receive less damage to their GPA because they did not spend as much time at USC, we have to remember that transfer students work just as hard to get to USC and continue to work hard during their residence here.
While the university boasts of integrity, honesty and fairness, transfer students continue to be cheated from their rightful recognition in receiving honors.

Right Matt, it’s not like any students get in as freshman, but choose to attend JC for 1-2 years since they’re prudent enough to understand the implications of an extra $45k/year of debt.
Oh wait… that happens quite often.
Boo hoo. You weren’t smart enough to get into USC as a freshman and now you don’t get an award from a school you are lucky to be getting a degree from in the first place. Cry me a river.

To most USC students, the idea of bulldozing the University Village and replacing it with a shopping mall, movie theater, public square and student housing sounds like a dream come true.
Students discussing the Master Plan at a forum last Thursday, however, raised some very valid concerns about the plan’s potential negative implications on both the student body and the community at large.
The motivation behind the plan makes sense: to provide students a nearby off-campus academic and retail space where they can feel comfortable, and to transform a commercial center badly in need of renovation.
The very nature of these aims necessitates a great deal of cooperation among the university, students, local business-owners and local residents.
Unfortunately, it seems that in the planning of the reconstruction, the concerns of only some of these parties have been taken into consideration. Most significantly marginalized are the current business owners in the University Village.
The Master Plan does not include measures that ensure their establishments will be allowed back. The university owns the land and is free to do what it wants with it, but it is under a certain ethical obligation to be a compassionate landlord.
The Master Plan hurts community members on the customer side of the spectrum as well. The plan states that the new space will have shopping, dining and entertainment options attractive to both students and community members but does not acknowledge that these two interests are not the same thing.
There is a huge disparity between the people inside the gates of this campus and the people outside. One group tends to have a greater ability to spend money on leisure; the other clearly has nothing close to those kinds of financial resources.
If too many pricey stores geared toward USC students are put into the new U.V., local residents will be forced to do their shopping elsewhere. Students who might have more diverse tastes or tighter budgets would find themselves in the same boat.
Though the Master Plan will create jobs for local residents, the vast majority will be temporary construction jobs.
On the student survey about the Master Plan that was emailed out last month, H&M and Forever 21 were two named examples of stores USC might include in the new space. Those living in the neighborhood around USC, some of whom have a limited English vocabulary, do not comprise H&M’s ideal hiring pool — it will most likely want to hire people from outside the neighborhood, who have experience in higher-end retail or who come from a demographic background that frequents their establishments.
Another worry expressed at the forum was housing costs. USC has made no specific commitment to keeping housing costs down, and when I think of the housing going up as part of the Master Plan, I cannot help but picture another Gateway apartments. Gateway is gorgeous, spacious, convenient — and rents for more than many USC students can afford. If the promised 5,200 new beds can boast quality and amenities, they too could end up costing $1,200 or more a month.
People living in other places in the neighborhood risk having their rents go up too, not merely because of the construction of more expensive housing nearby, but also with the infiltration of more expensive businesses in the area. Five more years down the road and home builders might be developing luxury condo complexes across the street from the mall. This will make rent more expensive for everyone, students and local residents alike.
Finally, what will this development do to the character of this neighborhood? Though it might not be the safest area of Los Angeles, I was initially attracted to the community around USC because of its cultural diversity and urban feel. I don’t just dislike the idea of The Grove in miniature going up across the street because I find it impractical and unfair, but because I find it out of place.
If USC were really paying attention to its neighbors, as it claims it has been, then the Master Plan would call for a development that renovates the U.V., certainly, but embraces the intrinsic character of the businesses and customers there.
I would love to see an abundance of ethnic eating establishments (not chain ones), garment stores and small grocery stores owned by locals, thrift shops and farmers markets like the one currently open on Tuesdays and Thursdays on University Avenue.
Ultimately, I hope to see a space constructed where students and community members come to interact with and appreciate each other more.
If the present vision of the Master Plan persists, however, I see just one more way USC will withdraw from its neighborhood. The university will boast a brand- new venue where students can live, study, shop and pretend that the locals don’t exist.
 
Francesca Bessey is a freshman majoring in narrative studies.
Who cares about the local residents? They murder USC students, as evidenced by the events of last night, and we should be doing everything we can to push them far AWAY from campus.
OMG U R SOOOOOOOO right EVERY local is a murderer!!!
Francesca, your points are right on. Anyone paying the least bit of attention to the history of USC in this area knows that community members from all backgrounds have long struggled against the university “renovating” around the neighborhood. It has almost always resulted in rent shooting up, local working-class home ownership opportunities dropping, students and community residents alike being forced into ‘more affordable’ and less liveable slumlord housing, and the same people being displaced because they can’t afford access to “new and improved” groceries, retail, living arrangements, etc. 
Furthermore, USC has made no promise that these so-called ‘new jobs’ this project will create will be SUSTAINABLE jobs – meaning that they would pay a living wage and that jobs would last more than the few years it will take to build. Because if we employ, as a previous commenter says, “hundreds, if not… thousands” of people in the short term, will they still have these jobs in the long term? Will the same folks we hire to build this extravagant project be able to even afford to shop or rent in the “new and improved” USC post-Master Plan? I doubt it, and so does anyone who has seen what happens when major research universities bully cities and communities into allowing these sorts of projects to go on. Look at New Haven, Harlem, Oakland, Princeton… I’m glad to see USC students voice their concerns, Francesca. Thank you for writing this very nuanced piece.
Also, for those who disagree with Francesca’s points, please examine this evidence (including that not-so-nice USC history I referred to), at your leisure.

So is your proposal that we keep the UV exactly the same so that the few thousand or so locals can pay lower rent?
I don’t get why people want to cling on to this outdated status quo. A renovated UV is going to be much bigger and bring more jobs. Any increase in rent is good for the community as it signals more cash flow from in the community, meaning more economic activity. 
You realize there are plenty, and I mean plenty, of other housing options available for locals, yes? But relatively almost a few dozen options for college students. Keep in mind, these are the same students who will be working high paying jobs, paying taxes and supporting the local low income workers. 
In any angle you look at this project, it’s better for the students and the locals. Any call for status quo has do far used outdated and mostly invalid arguments.
The call from community residents and the UNIDAD coalition is not to stop development. The call is to guarantee inclusion of local low-income residents in the development plan, rather than simply say it’s going to benefit everyone. 
Redevelopment and new investment is welcomed as long as it does not result in the worsening of ongoing displacement of local residents. The current draft plan will do just that – in effect replacing the current residents with different and wealthier residents. It is very possible for USC and the City to create a plan, without any delays, that include guarantees for local hiring, for initiatives and investments that will preserve and create affordable housing, and for the preservation and integration of existing local small businesses. 
The USC Master Plan is a tremendous opportunity for the University to demonstrate a genuine commitment to supporting the healthy growth and elevation of low-income communities.  In doing so, it would become a leader among universities across the country in yet one more very important realm.
The new UV will do nothing but good things for the community and USC itself. I cannot stand people who hold back progress for fear of being politically correct. This is long over due as it as — the community wants it as do the students and faculty of USC. The only bad thing about the project is that it can’t be built sooner!
The thinking that *not* renovating an outdated, pathetic looking shopping center is somehow helpful to the community and the students is regrettably just like the University Village: outdated and badly in need of a new perspective. 
Bulldozing the retail space as well as constructing the new one will provide the community around USC with plenty of job opportunities and income in the years to come, both as part of the construction effort as well as the new retail space that will sprout up. Sure, there will be temporary lay offs as the old space is vacated, but that temporary gap of a few years will more than make up what is yet to come.
The idea that since H&M or Forever 21 will not hire locals, we should halt a billion dollar project, is just idiotic thinking at best. H&M and Forever 21 might at max hire 30-40 people. This billion dollar project will hire in the hundreds, if not in the thousands in both the construction industry, as well as the housing/retail space that is created later on.
I’m sure the author’s comments are well-intended, but they’re also condescending and a little insulting. As one of those “marginalized” locals living outside the gates, I can tell you that many of us have been hoping for years that USC would upgrade the Village. If the current shoppers seem downscale, maybe it’s because of what’s being offered. We’ve lived within walking distance for 22 years, but we and our neighbors shop online, downtown, at The Grove or in Pasadena. Sure there are poor people in the neighborhood, but there are also many who would love an opportunity to shop locally at decent stores and go to decent restaurants. We don’t even mind if there are students there. They’re one of the reasons we live here, and while they do, they’re part of the community.

USG member salaries could be put to better use. 
Funding is an uphill battle for many student organizations, but for Undergraduate Student Government, it is a given. As an organization that is run by students and for students, why is it that so much money — our money — is spent on the subsidization of its members and not on its efforts to promote, sponsor and give a voice to more student organizations?
USG consists of more than 100 executive members and is therefore an employer of more than 100 students. As we all know, campus jobs are hard to come by, especially if you do not qualify for work-study.
USG is one of the only organizations on campus whose members receive a hearty pay. Nowhere on the USG website is it mentioned that USG members get paid, but why not? Would advertising such a perk not attract more students? Isn’t that what any organization would want? Maybe it’s because they want to attract students who are doing it because they want to and not because they’ll be paid. So then the question is: Why pay at all? There is no shortage of USC students who want to get involved, whether it is to improve their résumé or impact their community.
Our campus is filled with organizations such as Helenes, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council and our beloved Trojan Knights. Their efforts not only greatly impact our community — for the most part, they are also better known than those of USG.
Yet the members of these organizations commit time for no pay and with little subsidization. In fact, many on-campus organizations, whose impact is felt by students, turn to USG to get funding for events via the Discretionary Funding Board.
The board is no doubt a great resource for many on-campus organizations whose efforts are focused on furthering the community and the well-being of the student body (i.e. addressing the core of USG’s mission statement). This money, however, is a hot commodity and the leadership fund runs out fast.
If more money were spent on furthering on-campus student organizations through USG funding and less on the members of USG for their time, USG would already be achieving what it aims to do.
Why do we pay students to enhance the student body when most of the students who reading this already impact the campus but go unpaid and in need of funding?

As the Supreme Court seems once again poised to take up the topic of race-based affirmative action in college admissions decisions, America is reminded of the damage universities have inflicted in the name of multiculturalism.
Universities defend race-based affirmative action admission policies in the name of advancing diversity and promoting social harmony. But this branch of affirmative action has little social benefit.
Hye You | Daily Trojan 
In 2003, the Supreme Court decision in Gratz v. Bollinger prohibited universities from giving applicants automatic advantages based on race or ethnicity. A subsequent Supreme Court ruling affirmed, however, that colleges could consider both factors as part of a case-by-case assessment of individuals.
As a result, hundreds of prestigious universities across the nation have been able to award acceptances on the basis of race. An April 1 article in The New York Times found that even when laws restrict this practice, many universities find ways to get around them.
Race-based affirmative action is nothing more than legalized racism, which erodes the quality of education and undermines true hard work.
If administrators do not want to judge minorities by the color of their skin, they have to refrain from using race as justification in university admissions. They can no longer see race as an implied setback in society; it is certainly not indicative of a disadvantaged upbringing.
Asian-Americans, blacks and Hispanics don’t choose their race, yet almost every university unfairly tips admissions decisions in the favor of the latter groups, according to The New York Times.  To assert that differences in race make one group different from another is to imply that a person’s race comes attached with certain homogenous qualities and experiences.
Utilizing affirmative action to advance students from underprivileged backgrounds is much more reasonable than basing the practice on a factor as arbitrary as race. Indeed, a strong case can be made that prospective students from wealthy families have a much larger advantage in the college admissions process than students from families that are less financially stable.
Socioeconomic upbringing can very well determine the trajectory of a student’s college admissions process. Wealthier students have access to private tutoring, SAT practice tests and expensive college counselors. Relying on race, however, to imply socioeconomic disadvantages is akin to modern-day stereotyping.
Every college application deserves to be evaluated fairly and consistently. Using race to favor one student over another is not only unjust in practice. It is fundamentally rooted in an illogical and flawed premise.
The Supreme Court should affirm the irrationality of race-based affirmative action policies and pressure American universities to eradicate this absurd practice.
 
Ryan Townsend is a freshman majoring in business administration.
Reverse discrimination is not just an academic issue, but one in business as well.  Back in the 90’s it was a hiring practice among most companies to hire/promote women into positions of leadership and management, no matter their experience level, not their ability to lead.  Many men were overlooked for promotions, because the companies were forced to comply with governmental mandates to hire and promote more women.
Our country was built on the premise that if you are sdmart and do well, you’ll succeed.  And yes, there have been many women who were passed over for wearing a skirt, but times have changed.  we don’t need those mandates any longer.  We need to rid ourselves of affirmative action, as it has run its course and no longer needed.
“Our country was built on the premise
that if you are sdmart and do well,
you’ll succeed.”
Interesting! Which country are you from?
Great article! I completely agree

The Women of Troy fell to Pepperdine in a 1-4 loss Saturday. The Waves improved to a 6-0 record, while USC dropped to 5-2.
In the morning’s team competition, the pairs team of junior Katie Fuller and sophomore Natalie Hagglund was the only team to win, with scores of 25-23 and 24-22 in the No. 3 spot.
Playing in the No. 1 spot, Pepperdine’s Caitlin Racich and Summer Ross defeated USC’s sophomore Sara Shaw and graduate student Geena Urango 21-16 and 21-18.
“The most important thing to keep in mind when building a new athletic program is to slowly build a very strong foundation,” USC coach Anna Collier said. “Starting with this strong foundation will help build a better and more successful sand volleyball team in the future.”
During the afternoon competition, Shaw and Urango advanced to the semifinals by defeating Pepperdine’s Kellie Woolever and Victoria Adelhelm in the quarterfinals 21-18, 17-21 and 15-12.
Meanwhile, Fuller and Hagglund beat Pepperdine’s Lilla Frederick and Kim Hill in the quarterfinals 15-21, 21-14 and 15-10. Fuller and Hagglund then went on to defeat USC’s Shaw and Urango in the semifinals with scores of 21-17 and 21-19.
“I am very pleased we are doing well coming into a new sport,” Collier said. “I was not sure what to expect but I knew when watching the girls on the indoor team make it to the Final Four that I would have some great athletes to work with this spring.”
USC will participate next in the U.S.A.V Beach Collegiate Challenge April 14-15 in Hermosa Beach. The Women of Troy will play against Pepperdine, Hawai’i, Long Beach State and Loyola Marymount.
“These girls are winners. They had a winning season indoors and have brought that same mindset to the sand game,” Collier said. “They came into the season wanting to train hard and win, and thus far have been successful.”
Great new sport. Fight On Women of Troy. We Love You!!!
C U on da sand.

Playing its last regular season matches at Marks Stadium this weekend, USC took down the Arizona Wildcats then defeated the shorthanded Sun Devils for a perfect 7-0 conference record.
Heading into a three-game road trip against the Pac-12’s elite teams, the Women of Troy are riding a nine-game winning streak and have matched their best streak since 2003. Still at No. 4 in the country and looking to move up in the rankings, USC boasts an 18-2 record on top of its unbeaten Pac-12 streak as well.
While they may have a tough time taking on Cal, Stanford and UCLA — who all rank in the top 10, with the Lady Bruins leading the pack at No. 1 — the Women of Troy have carved out an extremely successful season thus far.
Against the Wildcats, USC reverted back to its early season woes as the team started off the match losing the doubles point. Despite picking up a win on court 2 by way of the No. 52 Valeria Pulido and Zoë Scandalis pairing, the Women of Troy would drop matches at 3 and 1, with Natasha Marks and Lacey Smyth taking down the No. 2 duo of Kaitlyn Christian and Sabrina Santamaria 9-8 (7).
Freshman Scandalis, now ranked 15th in the nation, would prevail for the game-deciding victory against Smyth in first singles, but not before gutting out a 7-6 (5) first set. Once the match was decided, junior Danielle Lao also had a strong victory on court 2 and Christian shrugged off a first set loss to recover for a win on court 4.
On Saturday, the Women of Troy squared off against a short-handed, yet upset-minded Sun Devils squad.
Unlike its match against Arizona, USC took the first two doubles games after the match on court 3 was won by default. On top of the third doubles match, ASU also had to forfeit matches on courts 5 and court 6 for singles because of a plethora of injuries to the squad.
The long-anticipated rematch between Scandalis and ASU’s Jacqueline Cako was a dud since Cako was out with an injury, but in her place was Michelle Brycki who would take the match 7-6 (2), 6-4.
The Women of Troy would easily take the matches on courts 2 and 3, but in four singles Christian had her hands full with Leighann Sahagun. Despite losing the first set 0-6, Christian displayed her usual grittiness and came back to take the match 6-1, 1-0 (10-5) after an intense tiebreaker.
With these two wins in the bag, the Women of Troy can focus the team’s attention on their arduous road ahead. This road trip will go a long way toward solidifying USC’s place among the nation’s elite. With the season ending in Westwood, the Women of Troy will look to exact some revenge on their crosstown rivals and take their place as the top team in the Pac-12.

The No. 1 ranked USC men’s volleyball team beat the No. 2 UC Irvine Anteaters for its 15th straight victory to the tune of a 25-22, 25-19, 27-29, 25-18 Senior Night victory in front of 1500 fans at the Galen Center.
Senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli led the way with 20 kills at a .390 clip on Saturday to allow the Trojans (20-4, 16-4) to control their destiny for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title.
For the team that starts two freshmen and has not settled on permanent top-seven starters, the Trojans went through a steep learning curve en route to their final bid.
Ciarelli was one of four seniors honored along with Steven Shandrick, Steven Mochalski and Jeff Carlson.
The Trojans avenged their 3-1 loss against the Anteaters (20-5, 16-5) from late January, when the Anteaters were the first-ranked team in the country.
The Trojans have only lost one match since then and have quickly risen to the nation’s top spot.
The Trojans continued their rotation of Maddison McKibbin, Tanner Jansen and Mochalski between one outside hitter and one opposite spot with great success. The trio combined for 20 kills while splitting time throughout the match.
Senior outside hitter Mochalski and middle blocker Shandrick added eight and five kills respectively. Shandrick also added 5 blocks.
The vaunted Anteater’s serving trio of Dan McDonnell, Carson Clark and Jeremy Dejno contributed six aces on the night. The Trojans, however, added emphasis on high-ball hitting to handle tough serves, which paid off as the Trojans finished with an overall hitting percentage of .287 to the Anteaters’ .206.
The Trojans outblocked the Anteaters 14.0-5.5 and held the Anteaters to a pedestrian .097 hitting percentage in the final set.
Freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers, the nation’s leading blocker, finished with a total of 7 blocks.
The Trojans also served up four aces of their own to keep the Anteaters off-balance.
If the Trojans win their last two matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge, they will win the MPSF title outright. The Trojans swept both teams earlier in the season.

Less than a week remains until the annual USC spring football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Trojans, however, are adjusting to a minor setback going into their final week of spring football practice.
Sidelined · With sophomore running back Tre Madden out, the Trojans will have to depend upon Buck Allen and Nelson Agholor. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Sophomore running back Tre Madden tore a ligament in his left knee following Thursday’s practice. Madden quickly became the sensation of spring practices after he switched from tailback to linebacker at the beginning of spring practice.
Before his season-ending injury, Madden was an easy fit into the running back corps since senior Curtis McNeal and sophomore D.J. Morgan were the only experienced players at the running back position.
Kiffin praised Madden Saturday for his versatility.
“[Madden is] one of the most valuable guys on our team,” Kiffin said.
Because of Madden’s injury, redshirt freshman Javorious “Buck” Allen and incoming freshman Nelson Agholor are expected to fill in at the tailback position. Allen, who comes in at 6-feet and 215 pounds, has stepped in for Madden’s absence.
Allen is still adjusting to the offensive schemes and pass protection.
“It is kind of overwhelming right now, but that is why I have coaches; they are here to help me,” Allen said.
Kiffin did not allow tackling during Saturday’s scrimmage at the Coliseum. Allen hoped that tackling would be included in the scrimmage.
“I can get hit and see how I feel,” Allen said. “[Saturday] I got back into a groove and got that running back feeling.”
Allen said that he will fully participate in Saturday’s spring game.
Allen has three practices remaining before the conclusion of spring football practice to prove that he can take up where Madden left off. Allen said that once he becomes more confident in his new role with the team, he believes everything will fall into place.
“Once I get fully healthy and gain confidence in myself, I feel like I can be that big back,” Allen said.
Running back coach Kennedy Polamalu is pleased with Allen’s performance thus far.
“He’s just learning to see the game a little quicker right now,” Polamalu said. “All the body parts are moving. He’s still looking around. He’s got those eyes rolling in the back of his head.”
Agholor, the 6-foot-one incoming freshman, will be another prospect for the tailback position even though he was recruited as a receiver. Agholor will officially join the team in the summer.
USC spring football practice will conclude Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at 1:30 p.m., where the Trojans will host their annual spring game.
[Correction: A previous version said the spring game began at 11:00 a.m.. The game begins at 1:30 p.m. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]

In a number of ways, it’s been a bit of a quiet spring for USC.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has taken fewer reps in order to allow redshirt freshmen signal callers Cody Kessler and Max Wittek to spend more time with the first team unit. Both are competing for the backup spot.
Junior All-American wide receiver Robert Woods, a preseason Biletnikoff Award candidate, has sat out of all 12 workouts while recovering from an offseason ankle surgery.
And in general, many of the eye-popping plays have been made by the defense.
In short, its spring practice and the highlight plays are typically few and far between, as is customary for many schools nationwide.
One of the bigger stories in recent weeks for USC has been the play of sophomore Tre Madden, a converted linebacker and special-teamer in 2011 who switched to running back to shore up a position that lacked depth.
This spring, the Trojans only have three scholarship tailbacks available — in addition to Madden — in redshirt freshman Javorious “Buck” Allen, senior Curtis McNeal and sophomore D.J. Morgan.
But on Thursday, things changed.
During the Trojans’ 11th spring-practice session, Madden attempted to plant his left foot, but instead fell to the ground — despite no contact.
Less than 24 hours later, Madden underwent X-rays, revealing a torn ligament that will require surgery and will force him to miss the entire 2012 season — a significant blow considering his strong play as of late.
“Probably one of the most valuable guys on our team,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said following Saturday’s scrimmage at the Coliseum. “We don’t have anyone like him. Nor do we have anybody coming in like him.”
The allure of Madden has always been his size. Listed at 220 pounds, he is roughly 30 pounds heavier than both McNeal and Morgan, who project to be atop the Trojans’ depth chart come the Sept. 1 opener against Hawai’i.
Madden tends to rely on strength, with a combination of speed; he has been clocked at running the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds.
In short, the former Mission Viejo High School standout is the big, bruising runner the Trojans have not quite found since LenDale White paired with Reggie Bush as the famed thunder and lightning duo in the mid-2000s.
Kiffin compared Madden to White at Saturday’s scrimmage, but “with longer speed and really good hands.” The comparison — though lofty — isn’t too far off.
“The sky was the limit and it will be when he comes back,” Kiffin said. “I think he will be a great player.”
Offensive coordinator and running back coach Kennedy Polamalu echoed a commonly held sentiment, at least among the coaching staff: Madden’s future is bright, still.
“In just my eyes and being around the position for 20-plus years, I think he would have been really special,” Polamalu said. “The nice thing is he has a redshirt and we’ll bring him back. People have come off the ACL [tear] and done well.”
Madden will stay at running back when he returns from the injury next spring. And considering McNeal is expected to graduate, that’s probably for the best. The position projects to be even thinner.
The Trojans are in need of depth, in part, because of scholarship restrictions preventing them from carrying more than 75 scholarship players.
Kiffin and company are still in search of that complementary back for this fall, and as the injuries pile up, so does the number of candidates.
Next in line? It appears to be Allen, the 6-foot, 215-pound redshirt freshman tailback from Tallahassee, Fla., along with incoming freshman wide receiver Nelson Agholor, who is expected to log carries at the position during fall camp.
At more than 200 pounds, Allen might eventually become the Trojans’ best bet at fulfilling that “big back” role for this season at least.
Returning from a hamstring injury, Allen’s first extended practice came during Saturday’s shortened scrimmage — speeded up, perhaps, because of Madden’s anterior cruciate ligament tear.
“I knew I had to help my team,” said Allen, who remarked that his hamstring was about 90 percent healed. “I knew I had to step up and make a move for my team.”
If Allen can fulfill that role, the Trojans would be more than welcome to factor him into the rotation in some capacity. After all, it’s an important one.
Granted, he hasn’t played much, battling injuries.
He redshirted last fall, as well — his first season with the program.
But the options are limited and finding that bruising runner is something of a necessity to some degree.
“You always want a finisher,” Polamalu said. “You want a guy at the end of the game. It’s nice to have that finisher so that the defense gets a break. So the quarterback gets the coverage he wants and that we need to see.”
Unfortunately for Polamalu and the rest of the staff, that search continues.

After capturing its last two road matches of the regular season, USC remains on track for a perfect record as the postseason looms ahead.
The No. 1 USC men’s tennis team (23-0, 3-0) tallied its 43rd consecutive victory after dismantling Arizona (5-14, 0-3) 6-1 Saturday in Tucson. The win came one day after a 5-2 win over Utah (11-8, 0-3) in Salt Lake City.
USC freshman Jordi Vives provided the clinching win over the Wildcats with his 6-1, 7-5 effort over Sebastian Ionescu.
Before Vives guaranteed USC’s final road win, No. 2 senior Steve Johnson and No. 53 sophomore Emilio Gomez each defeated their opponents in straight sets for the 3-0 USC advantage.
No. 23 sophomore Ray Sarmiento and freshman Roberto Quiroz added two more points for the Trojans with their singles wins, while freshman Eric Johnson fell 5-7, 5-7 to Carlos Bermudez for Arizona’s sole point of the match.
In doubles action, the three USC pairs swept the field for the sixth straight match to capture a 1-0 lead prior to singles play.
Before taking down the Wildcats in the 80-degree heat, the Trojans had defeated the Utes the day before in Salt Lake City, where they avoided the snowfall by facing off in an indoor stadium.
After a sweep in doubles play and two singles wins from Johnson and Quiroz, Gomez provided the winning touch over Utah with his 6-4, 6-4 victory over Devin Lane.
Sarmiento added another point for USC with a 7-6, 6-3 effort over Andre Vidaller before No. 13 senior Daniel Nguyen and No. 38 freshman Yannick Hanfmann both fell in a 10-point tiebreaker in the third set of their respective matches.
Sarmiento, who was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week for the second time last week, has six consecutive singles wins, with the last five all in straight sets.
“I’m playing well, [but] my goal is to peak in May. I just got to keep playing well, and I feel pretty good right now as a team,” Sarmiento said.
Quiroz is also streaking with 12 in a row, while Steve Johnson carries the heftiest streak at 55 consecutive singles victories dating to last January.
Despite the inevitable fatigue that comes with a back-to-back, the Trojans have welcomed the challenge with the understanding that the matches will harden the team for grueling postseason play.
“For me personally, there was a lot of fatigue in the second match, especially in the heat,” Sarmiento said. “This is great preparation. It presents a lot of challenges and, as a team, I think we did pretty well and came through.”
After taking its first four conference matches with a combined score of 25-3, USC will conclude the regular season and Pac-12 play against No. 5 UCLA (18-2, 4-0), No. 12 California (11-7, 4-0) and No. 11 Stanford (14-5, 4-0) at home.
The Trojans will begin their final three-game homestand against the Golden Bears on Friday at 1:30 p.m., followed by a clash against the Cardinal on Saturday at 1 p.m.

Call it walk-off weekend for USC baseball.
In their three-game homestand against California, the Trojans (19-10, 5-6) walked off against the Golden Bears (17-12, 2-7) on Friday and Saturday to win the series after dropping the opener Thursday.
All three games were decided in the ninth inning. On Saturday, it was freshman pinch-hitter Garrett Stubb’s walk-off walk with two outs in the ninth that gave the Trojans a 3-2 win.
Down to the wire · In the Trojans’ three-game series with California, each was decided in the ninth inning. In Saturday’s contest, freshman catcher Garrett Stubbs (above) walked with the bases loaded to give USC a 3-2 win. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans held a 2-1 lead heading into the top of the ninth, but the Trojan bullpen blew its second save of the series, allowing the Bears to tie the game. Senior right fielder Alex Sherrod led off the bottom of the inning with a single and advanced to second on a groundout. After an intentional walk, a groundout advanced the runners to second and third. With two outs, freshman left fielder Dante Flores was intentionally walked to load the bases and set up the force out at any base. But that left no room for error with Stubbs, who walked on five pitches to win the game.
It was the Trojans’ second walk-off win in as many nights. After being blanked for 8 2/3 innings Friday, sophomore second baseman James Roberts’ two-on, two-out, two-strike, walk-off single gave the Trojans a thrilling 2-1 win.
“It just felt good to be that guy,” Roberts said. “Before I even hit the ball I knew it was my time. I had to get this for the team.”
It looked as if the Trojans would squander another phenomenal pitching performance by senior ace Andrew Triggs, who went the distance, allowing only one run on six hits in a complete game, striking out eight and walking three.
“Andrew was spectacular,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “He was fabulous. He was able to get out of some jams, which was really impressive. In that eighth inning, that was huge when he got out of that jam.”
The Bears put two on with two outs in the eighth, but even having thrown 105 pitches, Triggs was still able to get out of the inning unscathed. He needed just seven to finish off his ninth inning at 112 total for the night.
“Triggs pitched his butt off and we rewarded him with a win,” Roberts said. “Based on how he’s pitched this whole year, he hasn’t gotten much run support, so we needed that for him.”
Triggs’ lone blemish came in the sixth inning, when the Bears scraped together a run with a pair of singles and a pair of sacrifices. Meanwhile, Triggs’ counterpart, Matt Flemer, took a perfect game into the fifth inning and left after 7 2/3 innings of shutout ball.
But senior first baseman Matt Foat led off the bottom of the ninth with a single. He was pinch-run for by the fastest guy on the team, sophomore outfielder Omar Cotto Lozada, who was bunted to second. After sophomore third baseman Kevin Swick was hit by a pitch, a sacrifice fly allowed Cotto Lozada to move to third. Swick then stole second and was pinch-run for by senior outfielder Garret Houts. With two down, it was all up to Roberts, who singled through the hole at shortstop to score the tying and winning runs.
“This year has been the walk-off hit year so far,” said Roberts. “The ninth inning has pretty much been our inning.”
The thrilling nature of the Trojans’ wins was welcome given the nature of Thursday night’s loss. Up 4-0 after five and two-thirds shutout innings by freshman Stephen Tarpley, the Trojan bullpen gave up two in the sixth, one in the seventh and two in the ninth; a crushing 5-4 defeat.
“There’s the ecstasy, there’s the agony of defeat,” said Cruz in summation of the weekend. “We know this group will compete. And that’s just what they did.”
Watched Thurs and Fri games from behind home plate. I wish Triggs and Matt Foat had yet another year to play, SC seems to be building something special! Triggs was an absolute monster in his 9 inning outing… I’m hoping it continues and that he is better rewarded in this year’s MLB draft! His win / loss record by no means indicates how good he really is!
Same for Tarpley, that kid could easily be sitting at 7 and 0. He was ahead on the count all night Thurs. and pitched awesome through 6.1 innings before a catcher interference call seemed to rattle his concentration. With all pitches originating in the SC dugout, I couldn’t help but wonder why so many “waste” pitches were called when he was ahead 0-2? 
Also wonder why Viramontes was pulled before the 9th with a 4-2 lead after he had just shut down the side in the 8th???
Fight On!

The California Psychological Association recently declared USC a psychologically safe work environment after the CPA determined USC met certain standards in employee involvement, safety and growth.
The university’s Center for Work and Family Life helped coordinate the application process for the CPA’s Psychologically Healthy Workplace Award, which the university carried out two other times, most recently in 2008.
Goal · The Center for Work and Family Life’s work with faculty and staff members helped USC meet standards in employee happiness. - Daily Trojan file photo
USC will formally be awarded the honor during the CPA’s annual meeting in Monterey, Calif., on April 21.
According to Linda Snouffer, the assistant director of the Center for Work and Family Life, the goal of the center is to provide support to all USC faculty and staff in order to help them through a wide variety of work-related and personal difficulties.
“The Center for Work and Family Life is the university’s employee assistance program,” Snouffer said. “We offer supportive services for the USC faculty and staff community and their families that can last from pre-employment through retirement.”
Additionally, Snouffer said the services the Center for Work and Family Life provides are vast and include an array of different services that aim to help employees maintain their mental health.
“Our core services include confidential brief, solution focused counseling for a wide range of personal and work-related concerns; consultative support for faculty, supervisors and departments; as well as a variety of programs and services targeted at helping faculty and staff preserve a healthy work/life balance,” Snouffer said. “Our licensed mental health professionals are experienced in helping individuals, couples and families address a wide range of personal and work related difficulties.”
To receive the award, Snouffer said USC was judged on a variety of criteria, and all employees provided their input concerning the university’s workplace policies.
“As part of the application process, USC was judged on its workplace practices, and five key award criteria [including] employee involvement, health and safety, employee growth and development, [recognizing] employees both individually and collectively and helping employees balance work and life demands,” Snouffer said. “In addition, an employee questionnaire was sent to all employees to receive their input on how the university’s workplace policies and practices help promote their health and well-being.”
The university applied for the recognition to further its status as one of the top colleges in the nation, Snouffer said.
“The Center applied for the award on behalf of the entire university,” Snouffer said. “USC has received the California APA’s Psychologically Healthy Workplace Award on two previous occasions; however, since last participating in the competition four years ago, USC has been identified as one of America’s Great Colleges to Work For by The Chronicle of Higher Education.”
Rachel Brauer, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said the recognition helps demonstrate the dedication of the university to using its resources to help its employees.
“It’s really great that USC [received] this recognition, because it shows the university’s dedication to maintaining a safe work environment,” Brauer said. “This award could be an asset to the university in the future, since many professionals could be attracted to work here because of the benefits the university offers.”

The Cadet Street Carnival, a three-day event hosted by the USC Dept. of Public Safety, wrapped up Sunday after hosting more than 40 rides and games that students and members of the community could enjoy.
The carnival serves as a yearly fundraiser for DPS’s cadet program.
“[The cadet] program is designed to give youth 12 to 21 years old an opportunity to learn about law enforcement and public
safety,” DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
The program has been in effect for several years and provides 96 hours of academic, physical conditioning and experimental classes.
“Students wear uniforms and assist officers with crowd control at football games,” Carlisle said.
Students are also required to maintain a certain grade point average and participate in weekly study halls.
“The DPS cadet program is a highly disciplined program and opens up lots of opportunities,” Carlisle said. “Some cadets have gone on to become law enforcement officers at DPS and others have received scholarships and grants for college.
The carnival began Friday on Hoover Street, blocking traffic between Jefferson Boulevard and 28th Street going both ways, and also re-routing city buses. The street reopened Monday.

Alex Banayan, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was hired after winter break as an associate with San Francisco-based venture capital firm Alsop Louie Partners to look for promising start-ups within the USC community. The hire makes Banayan, 19, one of the youngest venture capitalists in history.

Banayan will hold a part-time position with Alsop Louie and will continue as a full-time student at USC. Banayan will participate in a weekly conference call with the Alsop Louie Partners and will fly to San Francisco once a month.
“USC students now have an opportunity few other students have,” Banayan said. “It’s huge to have a venture capitalist on campus who will be so accessible so now students with ideas for start-ups can just shoot me an email and don’t have to try to pitch their ideas independently to venture capitalists in Silicon Valley.”
Venture capital firms invest in and financially launch start-up companies in return for a percentage of the business’s income.
“It’s like the movie The Social Network, where venture capitalist Peter Thiel gives start-up money to Mark Zuckerberg in return for a percentage of Facebook,” Banayan said.
Ashish Soni, executive director of digital innovation at the Viterbi School of Engineering, said Banayan’s position is a great addition to the opportunities that the university currently offers to its student entrepreneurs.
“Alex is slightly more accessible and less intimidating and will help USC students present their ideas to as many potential investors as possible,” Soni said. “Not to mention that Alex is a dynamic, charismatic and very polished individual who is a great representative for USC.”
Grace Huang, a freshman majoring in health and humanity, said the fact that Banayan is a student makes the thought of pitching an idea to a venture capitalist much less intimidating.
“It’s better for the student body because there’s a smaller age gap, and he understands what it’s like to be a student,” Huang said.
As Banayan admits, he does not fit the stereotype of a typical venture capitalist.
“The old rules of having to be a 60-year-old white male are gone,” Banayan said. “I’m 19 years old, the son of Persian immigrants and haven’t even taken the finance class at Marshall, yet somehow I’m on the phone hearing about multimillion-dollar deals.”
Banayan said it was not until after interviewing a president of Microsoft for this project that he decided to reach out to Ernestine Fu, 20, Alsop Louie’s associate at Stanford.
“So this past winter break I sent her an email, we got lunch and she presented me with this venture capital opportunity,” Banayan said.
Karen Kerr, senior director of new ventures and alliances at the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, said that having a presence on the USC campus will be an invaluable experience for Banayan.
“Being able to work with the experienced entrepreneurs and investors at Alsop Louie is a wonderful opportunity for Alex,” Kerr said. “In the venture capital business, the best way to learn is to do.”
Winnie Hui, a freshman majoring in business administration, said that Banayan’s position further expands the Trojan network.
“So many people here have new ideas and seeing the emphasis USC places on
networking, this is a great opportunity,” Hui said.
Banayan said he views this unique opportunity as a way to give back to his fellow students.
“I feel very grateful to be learning and getting so much, and for the next two years I want to be sharing this wealth of information with the USC community,” Banayan said.

Pinchas Cohen, a leading researcher and a former vice chair at the UCLA School of Medicine, was named dean of the Davis School of Gerontology on Friday by Provost and Senior Vice President Elizabeth Garrett on behalf of USC President C. L. Max Nikias. The appointment is effective Aug. 1.
Old school · The USC Davis School of Gerontology was the first professional school of gerontology and the first to offer a Ph.D. in the field. - Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
In addition to working as the school’s dean, Cohen will serve as the executive director of the Ethel Percey Andrus Gerontology Center, the school’s research arm. He was also named holder of the William and Sylvia Kugel Dean’s Chair in Gerontology.
Davis focuses on the study of different aspects of aging, ranging from its social effects to its biological effects.
Cohen’s research centers on mitochondrial biology and the significance of its role in aging. He is co-founder of CohBar, a biotechnology company working on using mitochondrial peptides in diabetes treatments.
Cohen’s work has been acknowledged by several organizations, receiving awards from the National Institute on Aging and the National Institutes of Health.
At UCLA, Cohen supervised teaching, training and research and worked in programs concerning age-related diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. Before his tenure at UCLA, Cohen worked as chief and professor of endocrinology at UCLA’s Mattel Children’s Hospital. He has also served as associate director of the UCSD-UCLA Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center.
Cohen serves on the boards of many professional organizations, including the American Federation for Aging Research and the Growth Hormone Research Society.
While working as a professor of pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA in 2009, Cohen was awarded a $2-million grant from the National Institutes of Health to fund his research in mitochondrial dysfunction, which has been linked to many diseases including Alzheimer’s, cancer and diabetes.
In addition to his research and teaching, Cohen, who has been cited in the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, has authored more than 250 papers in scientific journals, according to USC News.
Cohen received his medical degree from Technion School of Medicine in Israel with top honors and did his residency and fellowship at Stanford University. After his time at Stanford, Cohen spent seven years at the University of Pennsylvania.
Cohen will replace outgoing dean Gerald C. Davison, who announced his resignation at the end of August 2011. Davison said, at the time, that he believed a new dean could help the school continue to move forward.
Davison, who has held a range of positions since joining the faculty in 1979, will work on research and teaching at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences when his term is complete. Davison has previously served as interim dean of the USC School of Architecture, interim dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and chair of the Department of Psychology at Dornsife.

Los Angeles is stereotyped as an urban metropolis congested with traffic and clouded in smog, and unfortunately few areas successfully fight that generalization.
All natural · Taking a cue from architect and artist Lauren Bon, who planted millions of corn seeds near Chinatown in a project that came to be known as “Not a Cornfield,” the L.A. State Historic Park demonstrates that the city and nature can coexist. The park contains multiple trails and endless plant life, serving as a getaway from congested Downtown Los Angeles. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Even with all its urban hot spots, Los Angeles possesses some residents who appreciate nature and find it important to keep the city close to its roots. Before the city became the urban sprawl it is today, much of it consisted of nature growing wild and free.
Among those people concerned in retaining a focus on nature in the city is architect and artist Lauren Bon, who decided to tend to 32 acres of land near Chinatown in July 2005. Bon planted millions of corn seeds, and the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks soon began developing a park.
Bon’s creation became known as “Not a Cornfield” and though only a temporary project, it received attention from radio stations, blogs, newspapers and other media outlets. The project also went hand in hand with the organization’s Farmlab and Metabolic Studio, both of which were dedicated to fostering artistic expression and preserving nature. The programs were located in a warehouse that held public events including workshops.
Though you can no longer find a giant cornfield today, the project evidently left a lasting impression on the surrounding area. Today, visitors can experience a location very different from Chinatown, despite being so close to the bustling cluster of restaurants, stores and galleries. The large stretch of land on North Spring Street now serves as the L.A. State Historic Park.
Before you enter the impressively large area of land, you can see a couple of run-down cars filled with dirt and plants nearby. The cars are completely open, allowing the plants inside to receive sunlight and grow. One of the cars is decorated with painted figures and has two small trees growing where the hood has been removed. The two cars harken back to Bon’s idea of introducing a dose of nature to the city; the plants inside could represent the city’s move to use concrete rather than preserve the natural green areas of the landscape.
Above one of those cars, on the wall of a nearby building, a neon sign reads “concrete is fluid.” The sign is not the only of its kind; in 2007, the neon sign read “another city is possible,” a fitting phrase to put over the building. Before that, the phrase “artists need to create on the same scale that society has the capacity to destroy” also shone in neon.
The rest of the suites in the building house small rooms for businesses factories. Walking across from this structure, visitors encounter the large space of land now known as the historical park. The acres offer a few different trails that provide a rare opportunity to simply wander among nature.
Admission is free and there is little need to travel too far from Downtown Los Angeles, as evidenced by the fact that visitors can spot the Downtown buildings from the park.
The park itself now contains various types of plants, some labeled by rocks with writing on them. From afar, the landscape looks endlessly green, but the area is populated with people and a few interesting spots.
Walking along what could be the middle of the plot, visitors will encounter a zen garden-like area with white sand. A small path leads into the circular plot of sand with a circle of stones in the middle. The sand is calming and reveals many footprints, making the walk into the small area a communal experience.
The park also includes a few wooden benches for relaxation. The area feels more like a get-away than a typical park. And though visitors can spot the Gold Line Metro station train occasionally whizzing by, this park generally strays from the city atmosphere and lets visitors get lost for as little or as long as they wish.
From the environmental efforts of one artist to the attention of a city, the spot proves rewarding and enjoyable when compared to Los Angeles’ other underrated spots. When any Angeleno feels overwhelmed by the familiar sights and sounds of the city, the park’s open gates can offer quite the getaway.

History textbooks dictate what we know and the way we are supposed to learn about America’s past. But who makes them the authority to determine how we see or understand history? Director, choreographer and co-creator Dayna Hanson poses this question in Gloria’s Cause, a play at Downtown Los Angeles’ REDCAT.
Gloria’s Cause delves into the various aspects of American history as it explores performance art. It takes the audience to a place that is strange and almost unrelated to the chapters of our textbooks or what we perceive to be “true” history.
Stated in the audience program notes, the production of this fractured tale is “inspired as much by America’s maddening inequalities as by what we really, truly love about this country.” This statement holds true as all the play’s occurrences seem to take place at the same time, offering a fractured view that is at times almost incoherent and makes for a confusing but compelling retelling of the American Revolution.
And what exactly is Gloria’s Cause?
“The revolution,” Hanson explained in an interview with The Seattle Times in 2010, “was called the ‘glorious cause’ in the rhetoric of the day. For me, Gloria is a specific name for the anonymous forgotten player of the time, female or not. Whose cause was it, really? It’s the question that interests me more than the answer.”
This play was not conceived blindly. Research for Gloria’s Cause was conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with American history scholars who guided the creators through Revolutionary War-era documents and artifacts and advised them on race and class relations of that period.
Through monologue and narration, dance and music, singing and the exploration of sexuality, Gloria’s Cause utilizes performance art. It takes a satirical approach to social commentary. It even becomes a rock musical as the cast takes turns impressively playing instruments, singing and dancing.
Despite a video montage at the end of the production, most of the play focuses on the American Revolution’s forgotten players. It questions the ideas our forefathers fought for by unlocking what might have been their personal insights into what became the America we know today.
For instance, the play explores iconic moments of American history, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which is presented with the actors hunched over with only the top of their heads available for the audience to see; the audience, then, must rely on the actors’ voices and dialogue to examine the backroom debates over the wording of the document. This play seems to suggest that these ideas have become versions infused with more modernistic viewpoints.
For example, a Revolutionary soldier recounts the hardships he endured while fighting the war and the incompetence of his commanding officer in a way that revamps history and the heroic moments we know of the war.
The soldier confronts his officer, George Washington, who stumbles into the scene as a drunken mess, exemplifying his shortcomings. The scene forces the viewer to wonder how Washington led thousands of men into war with the English to fight for our country’s freedom.
Washington and the soldier even wind up fistfighting until a security guard tears them apart. This is one of many scenes where the audience is inserted into a time machine to view history in a modern setting. Even as the players remaster the events that put our country in motion, it is difficult to connect the dance movement to the performance’s overall narration and message.
This production stands apart as an atypical play. It doesn’t follow a consistent time or storyline, nor does it follow any particular pattern. There is no rising action, climax or falling action, yet it sucks the viewer in. Even the way the director chose to have the actors use microphones in some scenes and not in others forces the audience to pay close attention. Moreover, the audience cannot tell whether the play has concluded because of the ending’s ambiguity.
Like a drug-induced haze, the audience is inserted into the scattered minds of these nine artists through a retelling of history, even if it is not always one that everyone will understand.
The production shines in the way that it engages, informs and questions our history through art. How do we, the people who live in this country of liberty, justice and freedom, judge the way in which our rights were obtained? If given just the facts, unbiased and straight forward, how would we really appreciate history? What other stories about history could we form in our own minds?
The concepts are great, but the play could stand to have someone other than its creator serve as the director; it often feels like the audience is subjected to the artists’ stream of consciousness. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see where Gloria’s Cause goes as its concepts are further refined.

The lead-up to Springfest, planned annually by Program Board’s Concerts Committee, is always a time of intrigue, mostly because of one question: Who will perform?
Flashing lights · McCarthy Quad filled to the brim with revelers Saturday, and Springfest flaunted some nice production value: Headliner Wolfgang Gartner’s set featured a hypnotic show of lasers and lights. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
This year’s headlining act, Wolfgang Gartner, inspired divisive responses that ran the gamut of reaction. There was wide-smiling excitement from fans of Gartner’s throbbing, club-flavored brand of electronic dance music who knew the house-music veteran would put on an impressive show.
Then, there were those less familiar with the performer — “Wolfgang who? I hear they’re electronic?”
But Springfest isn’t just about the headliner. The event flaunted a long string of musicians that performed from noon on, including Jonny Come Lately and Black Crystal Wolf Kids. The show really got started, however, with alternative-rock band Anberlin. Though the quintet didn’t garner a particularly large crowd, the group of fans that did show up was a dedicated, feisty one that pushed up against the stage barrier with glee.
Crowd interaction was at a high, including a humorous incident involving a heckler — “Get outta here!” frontman Stephen Christian yelled at him after stopping a song midway through. And at various points during the show, guitarist Christian McAlhaney leaned out over the raucous crowd, pointing his mic stand out to those who were singing along.
The performance ended with a big grin from frontman Christian as he dropped the mic to the ground, sending a yelp of feedback as the last note. Almost immediately, the crowd started chanting: “One more song!  One more song!” Predictably, the band — sans bassist Deon Rexroat — came back for an encore with the slow-burn ballad “The Unwinding Cable Car.”  Christian’s voice shined in the finale as he held out a impressively long, perfectly in-tune note, his cuttingly clear tone reverberating across McCarthy Quad.
Offering a change of pace, dance crew I.aM.mE stepped up with a performance that featured sharp, impressive choreography. The sixth-season America’s Best Dance Crew champions lived up to their pedigree: Solo moments were particularly impressive, with a few highlights, including Di “Moon” Zhang’s intricate isolations and Phillip “Pacman” Chbeeb’s expert contortions and popping.
And could anyone have delivered better dance moves to dubstep? Some of I.aM.mE’s most impressive moments came timed with the shuddering, hammer-like boom of bass and synth screeching; the full-body twitching of the dancers elicited hoots and cheers from the crowd.
Though some of the group choreography lacked perfect synchronicity, the dance crew still left quite an impression and did so on an unfortunately small stage.
Seattle-based rapper Macklemore took the stage next with his producer Ryan Lewis and trumpetist Owuor Arunga, and nearly stole the show with his blend of whip-smart lyricism and a jagged, conversational flow.
Equally notable were Macklemore’s lengthy stories that he addressed to the crowd. Funny, honest and perfect as transitions between songs, Macklemore’s tales — including one involving his “drunk-ass Irish uncle’s” early support and a monologue in which he pondered the positive effects of dry-humping — showed off the rapper’s ability to connect with his crowd.
Not that he needed the dialogue — Macklemore’s rapping and incredible stage presence would’ve been enough to enthrall the audience, especially with tracks like “Otherside.” He might as well have been dripping swagger, not sweat; the crowd took note, swelling to fill the now-darkened quad.
Macklemore wasn’t the only star onstage: Lewis and Arunga were essential to the show, the former mixing and yelling rhymes with Macklemore as the latter blew trumpet cries into the night, swigging from a gallon container of Arizona Iced Tea. Arunga also couldn’t help but keep chuckling at an audience member’s pink panties (“Oh. My. Word,” noted a grinning Macklemore) that the rapper had hung from Arunga’s mic stand.
Considering Macklemore’s humor and outrageous stage antics, it’s no surprise that rapper’s last song, “And We Danced,” was a riotous bit involving a British alter-ego, a gold-sequined cape and a messy, mop-like blond wig. The crowd twisted and danced in an overflow of energy as Macklemore hip-thrust the stage floor with a sexual fury — a perfectly odd sight and fun beyond imagination.
And finally, it was time for the headliner. Gartner rose from behind the DJ booth and immediately jumped into his set, unleashing wave after wave of crackling synthesizers and the whooping yells of syncopated sirens.
The quad was packed, a frenzy of lights and lasers marking the silhouettes of slender girls in sheer T-shirts riding on the tops of male shoulders. The pervasive, humid scent of sweat-laced bodies wisped in the air, mingling with the char of marijuana and Marlboro Lights as Gartner effortlessly mixed drop after drop of thrumming bass.
Further away from the stage, glovers with sparkling LEDs on fingertips entranced small groups of people as others danced to the beat. Gartner’s set inspired even the most unlikely of people to join in the festivities: A Contemporary Services Corporation guard in full work dress burst into a bout of prodigious shuffling madness, drawing whoops and cheers from the circle that had formed around him.
Unsurprisingly, Gartner drew the biggest reaction for his remixes of well-known songs, including a catchy take on The Ting Ting’s “Hands” as well as a crafty melding of new beats with the Daft Punk classic “The Prime Time of Your Life.”
As Gartner’s final song hummed to a close, the crowd started chanting: “Wolfgang! Wolfgang!” With a gracious smile and clasped hands, Gartner saluted the audience and departed. The audience slowly trickled out of the quad, tired bodies illuminated only by the soft yellow of a full moon and the orange glow of Parking Structure X.
Then, from the night: “Everyone to Leavey to study!”
