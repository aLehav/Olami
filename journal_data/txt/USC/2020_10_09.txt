This year’s MLB postseason has me outraged.
I am writing this column about eight hours before my beloved New York Yankees — led by manager and former USC Trojan Aaron Boone — face elimination in Game 4 of the American League Division Series against the Tampa Bay Rays. With a heavy heart, I write in complete honesty that even though I am hurt and disappointed, I am not sure if I can say that I am surprised.
The Yankees had a hot start to this shortened 60-game season, then went cold after almost all of their starters got hurt (including outfielders Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton and infielders Gleyber Torres and DJ LeMahieu, just to name a few). When they were fully healthy again, the team had some good momentum going into the Wild Card Series against the Cleveland Indians, and they took care of business there. So far, so good.
Now, in my opinion, had the Yankees not become injured and cold in the middle of the season, they would be the first — and best — team in the American League. But the pitching rotation is weak (righty Luis Severino and lefty James Paxton are both injured), except for the $324 million man, righty Gerrit Cole, and even he does not look nearly as spectacular as he did last year.
Then, I looked at the rest of the league.
As far as I’m concerned, the Houston Astros should not have been allowed under ANY circumstance to even contend for a postseason appearance. But of course, Rob Manfred, who is arguably the worst commissioner in the history of Major League Baseball, decided to expand the postseason format to allow three more teams to make it, which now includes the Astros. And of course, Houston is on its way to the American League Championship Series.
Oh, and the Rays beat the Toronto Blue Jays in a two-game sweep while  allowing only 3 runs in total. Not good.
Of course, I must acknowledge that most of the Daily Trojan’s readers are (likely) Los Angeles Dodgers fans. So, luckily for you all, they look like the championship-caliber team that everyone has hyped them up to be so far. Good for you.
But here’s where my frustration lies with the Yankees: They’ve been doing this every year since they last won the World Series in 2009. Here’s a quick rundown of their finishes since then:
Notice a pattern? That’s right! The Yankees are contenders almost every single year, for 162 games, and then they choke in the postseason. We continually believe they are one of the best teams in baseball only for them to disappoint.
It’s hard, tiring and exhausting. I was speaking to some friends recently about this frustration, and their response was a good one: “Shawn, why are you so upset about the Yankees but you root for the Knicks and Giants every year?”
The answer is simple: I go into every basketball and football season with the lowest expectations for my teams, so I’m rarely disappointed. The Yankees, on the other hand, make us believe that they genuinely can win it all. Every. Single. Year.
And so because this happens every year, the shock factor slowly vanishes. It is for this reason that I am no longer overly surprised.
Game 3, an 8-4 loss, was so hard to watch that I actually changed the channel to watch the vice presidential debate after the sixth inning. I chose to watch politics over my favorite team in a playoff game. Yes, it was that bad.
But hey, maybe I’ll see this column installment as an icy cold take if the Yankees win two games in a row and advance. I hope and pray to whatever higher powers there may be that this is the case — though by the time you read this, their fate may already be sealed. As of the time of this writing, though, the historic, famed and revered New York Yankees are a disappointment to the game of baseball.

While putting my brother’s Netflix subscription to good use, I stumbled upon “The Laundromat,” a satirical take on the Panama Papers financial scandal. Though not extremely entertaining, the film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, made it apparent that USC’s representation in mainstream media only serves to enforce the negative stereotypes that surround us. 
The caricature in “The Laundromat” comes in the form of a recent graduate from USC, who enters the screen driving a BMW convertible, wearing a college hoodie and carrying a case of Dom Pérignon along with her Gucci handbag. As we see her walking around her house, better described as an estate, her graduation party preparation ensues featuring Versace dresses, crystal chandeliers, cardinal and gold canopies and a performance by the USC cheerleading troupe. For most of us, this isn’t a standard party, but then again, she isn’t your standard student.
The general conception of USC students being ostentatiously wealthy or incredibly spoiled is nothing new, nor is it completely wrong. But it does disregard most of the students’ experiences. Nearly two-thirds of “The University of Spoiled Children”’s Class of 2022 is receiving some form of financial aid. Though the school might cater to the whims of the elite, it houses thousands of students whose reality couldn’t be more different. Next to the student who spends $100 on new acrylics without batting an eyelash, it’s not surprising to find someone who is rationing meals in order to last the semester. 
It should go without saying that the spoiled, rich kid trope does not represent a majority of the student population, nor does it help the University’s unflinchingly problematic reputation. To everyone who has worked hard to attend USC, the ill reputation brought on by select students, the administration, and the media elicits frustration and resentment. 
At the core of this frustration is the college admissions scandal. I doubt it is an exaggeration to assume that every USC student has heard either a remark about paying our way in (no matter our financial situation), a suggestion to join the rowing team or a reference to USC’s creative and seemingly infinite acronyms. If you’ve heard them all in one conversation, congratulations! You’ve hit the jackpot. 
As we evolve from the University of Spoiled Children to the University of Second Choice to the University of Scandal & Corruption, I’ve found that the jokes get a little old. That is unless you’ve seen the “Saturday Night Live” sketch “College Admissions” that opens with a shot of our very own Doheny Library. The sketch focuses on five admissions officers discussing the students who will get to join the class of 2023. Sandra Oh, Cecily Strong, Kenan Thompson and other SNL cast members agree to accept students based on merit but end up accepting students who are heiresses with poor grades and fourth-generation legacies with criminal records. Seasoned with implications of racial bias, bribery and fraud, the NBC show makes a clear nod to our troubled reality. 
When I first watched this sketch in 2019, I found it hilarious and admired the use of humor to criticize what was happening at the time in the college community. Now, it remains a sad reminder that the perception of USC is not too far from reality.
Another “SNL” sketch shows an inmate at Chino Correctional Facility incredulously asking his fellow inmate Lori Loughlin, “You paid 500 grand for USC?” We also get a similar mention on the Netflix show, “#blackAF” where lead Kenya Barris refers to USC as the Harvard of the West, not because of our academic prowess but in regard to our elitist attitude. Considering that USC was ranked No. 24 in national universities by U.S News in 2020, it’s pretty clear that the corruption and scandal that surrounds us leaves no room for our education to be celebrated in the outside world. 
The Trojan community has an immense amount of pride and spirit, most apparent when UCLA and football are involved, but equally steadfast when it comes to our academic achievements.
It seems that for a University with the leading cinematic arts school in the nation, we are severely lacking in a positive portrayal of our school within the same field. For an institution that makes no secret of being featured in 69 films and 75 TV shows, shows that do mention USC, like “The OC,” “#blackAF” and “Gossip Girl” only serve to make it seem like a party-oriented, privilege-driven community where the only thing that matters is the size of your parents’ wallets.
As our representation remains unfavorable and our reputation worsens with every scandal, the most immediate way to correct this would be at the administrative level. In this case, change needs to come from the very top to address all the systemic issues that have created our current environment. 
Nevertheless, we must also hold ourselves accountable. We might not have control over the admissions process, the illegal transactions or the selection of athletes for the rowing team, but we need to take a moment to consider how we’ve contributed to this issue ourselves. There’s nothing wrong with throwing extravagant parties, driving expensive cars or drinking a $300 bottle of wine, but a problem arises when students with privilege, who are often chosen to represent us, aren’t sensitive to the circumstances of other individuals within our community. At the risk of sounding like a brochure, the type of change we need starts from encouraging a student body that celebrates and fosters inclusivity, diversity and a stronger connection to the Los Angeles community.

As many were two weeks ago, I was planted in front of the television in my living room, watching the first presidential debate of this year’s general election. While many comments made warranted reactions, one concept resonated with me as a view of education that contrasted my own. 
In response to a question about reforms that encouraged racial sensitivity training in schools and workplaces, the sitting president justified pulling back on these practices out of concern that they were instilling a hatred of our nation in the citizenry. 
Comparatively, it was a minute detail amid the slew of topics addressed that night, but it stuck with me as a view of the United States that I would never identify with because the color of my skin and my place of birth would never warrant me a seat among those who the U.S. was built for. 
It evoked a feeling of disappointment rather than resentment. In a sense, it was a realization that those that govern my future have no real regard for my past. 
Like so many within underserved communities, it has become admittedly difficult for me to feel anything but dissatisfaction with my country’s attempts to heal a chronic wound with insistence that it doesn’t exist in the first place. The current administration’s offensive strategy of erasure and denial breeds mistrust more than the truth. 
The issue of inclusion in the U.S. is one that affects the lives of immigrants and marginalized communities. Substantive inclusion initiatives are hard to come by and, so far, inclusion has become more of an optical on-paper concept than a lived experience shared by Americans as an integral facet of society. 
In the month of October, my people were given a heritage month. Hailed as an inclusive campaign intending to recognize the beauty of foreign culture and hyphenated American progress, the dedication of the months to underrepresented voices provides a way for the multicultural community to find a balance. 
In every regard, the merits of this idea are endless, but this initiative falls short in its reach. 
While I admire the sentiment and acknowledge the efforts made to be inclusive, the concept of the heritage month is not synonymous with reparation for past traumas. There is little to show that this movement has translated from the calendar into our daily lives. 
During these periods of increased accessibility to platforms, we should be coupling cultural appreciation with social change. 
To begin, we should be looking to the future. 
While President Donald Trump argues against a curriculum that encourages transparency about our racial history, I argue that that is precisely what our nation needs. For much of my childhood, Christopher Columbus was the hailed hero and founder of the U.S. In a similar fashion, world history was laid out before me through the lens that the U.S. was the savior of developing nations and the staunch defender of democracy. 
While this view is legitimate to some, it discredits the demographics that were stepped on in order to uplift U.S. exceptionalism. 
Similarly, while I was taught a history written by white authors, I was taught very little of where I might stand in this history.
Instead of my educators, it was my family who helped me uncover my history with the U.S. and how my people have developed alongside this nation. While it didn’t make me hate the U.S. as Trump suggested, it opened my eyes to the injustices in this nation that will not vanish despite the effort to hide them away. 
Beginning with how we educate future generations, these initiatives have the potential to become grassroots movements that have the power to mobilize whole communities. 
Beyond the heritage month, we need to see genuine appreciation for cultural diversity in the places where we live, where we study and in the media we see online. Representation in these spheres is paramount to coloring our world accurately and doing so is in the best interest of all demographics. 
Today, we see the effects of a 200-year standoff. Since the conception of this nation, there have been key cultures and populations excluded from the narrative and progress has been gradual in adding in more inclusive policy as the years go on. 
Instead of snubbing our complex racial history, a true heritage month would acknowledge the mistakes of past generations and not allow history to repeat itself. 
Beyond a heritage month, we should be striving toward a better nation that we might all see ourselves a part of. Instead of gifting us 30 days of inclusion, allow marginalized populations a seat at the table, a page in the history books and a place to call home that is accepting of our identity and history.

Amid a pandemic, the national reckoning on race and an approaching presidential election, 2020 has been a year like no other. Reactions to the police killing of George Floyd prompted numerous discussions on various social media platforms about topics such as systemic racism and police brutality. 
Countless creators, artists and activists — many part of Generation Z — have begun to publish visually appealing short guides on Instagram covering serious and often complex topics. Some posts might explain how to be a better ally or provide information on climate change and how to mostly stop using Amazon while others may oversimplify political issues. Regardless, if you search hard enough, there’s bound to be a post, explainer or guide that advocates for virtually any cause you can think of and likely with tens of thousands of engagements.
Wide chunky typefaces, bold gradient graphics, serif fonts and pastel color palettes define most of these social justice slideshows. These design choices, often co-opted from established brands, are intended to catch a user’s eye and prompt them to read the post. Their extremely digestible formatting makes posts easy to read but does not paint complete pictures of the issues being outlined. As a result, this trend has become an easy way for people to appear as though they are contributing to activism without actually taking action.
In tandem with social justice explainers, Instagram creates a space for very short-lived expressions of activism that are largely performative. Sharing a post to a story that expires in 24 hours is a remarkably easy virtue signal to feign solidarity with a movement or issue. Because Instagram is driven by sharing photos and not information, it is incredibly difficult to be anything but performative and reductive.
Professor Eve Ewing of the University of Chicago used the Instagram explainer template to criticize these graphics. She stated that they often oversimplify complex ideas in misleading ways, are not attributed to someone who can be held accountable for errors and frequently draw on the work of scholars and activists without credit.
These explainer posts particularly rely on the simplification of complex histories and ideas. That process of simplification and generalization to fit facts into 10 slides also largely depends on the ideological perspective of the creator, even when the post tries to position itself as non-ideological. When this is considered simultaneously with the use of eye-catching fonts, backgrounds or visuals, the presentation of grave topics such as racism or sexism might be seen as trivialized.
Many creators also work to verify and vet their posts, but as with anything on the internet, misinformation and disinformation are always lurking, especially in the polarized society that we live in. It is remarkably easy for a shoddily researched post that misconstrues a political idea to be given an air of false legitimacy because of its presentation. On a platform like Instagram, it is ever-important to be aware of how we consume and disseminate information that furthers a cause. 
The very nature and essence of Instagram renders it a categorically poor substitute for real activism. Sharing something on social media is barely an adequate measure of activism and posting should never provide a substitute for real activism. The trend of social media explainers has commodified activism and reinforces the dangerous idea that people do not need to take the time to actually educate themselves and flesh out the issues brought to light.
Regardless, maybe it’s better that these digital conversations are indeed happening than not at all. However, when saturation is paired with oversimplification and misinformation, it becomes clear that more work needs to be done. This form of activism is merely a stopgap before education and civic engagement and cognizance. Learning, particularly in these manners, does not end on Instagram — in fact, it ought to be just the beginning.

The USC School of Pharmacy and the City of Los Angeles have partnered to offer free flu vaccines at coronavirus testing sites. The move is an effort to practice a coronavirus vaccine rollout plan, increase health care accessibility for all L.A. residents and avoid a flu season exacerbated by both influenza and the coronavirus.
As of Sept. 22, free flu vaccines have been offered at mobile coronavirus test sites where residents are less likely to have cars or health insurance and will continue to be staffed each Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday, through part of December, according to Dr. Richard Dang, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy. Dang, who is the chair of the COVID-19 Task Force for the California Pharmacists Association, also oversees the free flu vaccination initiative. He said that he expects about 100 participants per day. 
“We know that it’s going to be an important vaccination to have because the upcoming months that we’re experiencing from September to March is what is typically known as our influenza season,” Dang said. “As the cases of COVID-19 could potentially continue to rise, we’re faced with what some people are calling a twindemic — having the epidemic of COVID-19 as well as influenza.”
While Dang said that influenza vaccines are even more crucial this year because of the pandemic, the idea for the free flu vaccines originated from discussions between the School of Pharmacy and Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office about L.A.’s preparations for the eventual coronavirus vaccine. They decided to administer free flu vaccines at coronavirus test sites in order to practice the operational rollout of coronavirus vaccines. Dang said that the pilot clinics are a “win-win because everyone needs to get a flu shot this upcoming season.”
Dr. Irving Steinberg, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy and pediatrics who is also the associate dean for faculty affairs at the School of Pharmacy, said that people can have COVID-19 and the flu at the same time, making it more important than ever to vaccinate and continue to practice social distancing, masking and hand-washing measures. 
“The other benefit in having an influenza vaccine is that it diminishes … the confusion between what a patient may be suffering in terms of influenza symptoms and what a patient may be suffering in terms of COVID-19 symptoms,” Steinberg said. “If you cover one with an available vaccine, now if you’re going to be suffering shortness of breath and fever and aches and pains, maybe you can be more assured that that’s not influenza because you vaccinated effectively. And that’s important because the treatment strategies are of course vastly different.”
In the past, the School of Pharmacy has offered free flu shots at health fairs in neighboring communities; however, this is the first time the school has collaborated with the city to provide vaccinations. The School of Pharmacy provides expertise and on-site medical volunteers, while L.A. Fire and Community Organized Relief Efforts assist with day-to-day logistics, safety and location of the clinics and non-medical volunteers. L.A. County provides additional expertise and doses of influenza as well, Dang said.
 “We’re hoping that these relationships will continue to thrive in the future because even after this year, after the COVID crisis and after the COVID pandemic, there’s going to be a continued need to receive annual influenza vaccines and other health screenings,” Dang said. “So, definitely looking forward to the future now that we have these strong relationships with these important partners.” 
Whitney Fakolade, a graduate student studying pharmacy, has been involved with planning the clinics, administering vaccines and educating patients on the importance of a flu vaccine. 
“As pharmacists, we see that it’s important for our community to know that we are accessible to them, to make sure that we can protect them and provide information for health, because most people having a primary care provider may not be a practical thing,” Fakolade said.
In L.A., coronavirus testing is offered at mobile sites as well as static locations with drive-up testing in places such as Dodger Stadium. Free flu shots are currently only available at the mobile sites, but Dang said there are plans to eventually expand to static testing locations as well. Once vaccine clinics have been expanded to static testing locations, Dang said that he hopes to conclude which model would be the most effective for administering COVID-19 vaccines.
For now, his team focuses on mobile clinics, which include tent and table set-ups at parking lots and parks to increase accessibility for people who may not have access to cars, according to Dang. Through the mobile clinics, the team can target particular areas where people with barriers to health care typically congregate. One example he brought up was a mobile clinic at the YMCA East L.A., where neighborhood residents were already picking up daily free meals and could get a free flu shot at the same time.
Dang said that the majority of the people treated so far have not had health insurance and belong to underrepresented populations who are typically from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. He added that the team “saw a pretty significant number of immigrant populations who may have been undocumented or maybe were in the process of getting documentation.” 
“The nice thing about working with a mobile unit is that they’re really choosing locations based on the needs of the community,” Dang said. “We have a really big focus on looking at health equity, and it became very evident when COVID testing first came out that there are certain populations that just don’t have access; that don’t have the ability to drive to some of these large testing locations. Even for those populations, they either don’t have health insurance or they don’t have access to reliable health care with a primary care clinic.”
In order to further the goals of accessibility, Fakolade said that pharmacists have implemented screening and registration tools in different languages, as many patients do not speak English. Most of the advertising has come from word-of-mouth and social media, she said.
“It’s very interesting because we have a set of patients that spoke Mandarin, and we had a student who was pretty good at Mandarin and the student asked them ‘Oh, how did you hear about us?’” Fakolade said. “And they were saying how they were reading that we were providing these services off of a Chinese blog that they subscribed to.”
Due to the nature of the mobile units, most of the dates are tentative up until a week before the clinics, Dang said, so people who want flu shots will be able to visit coronavirus.lacity.org/flushot for the most up-to-date information on where the clinics will be stationed each week.

When it comes to tackling complex issues of social justice and online hate speech, Aida Davani knew it would take a novel approach. With a background in computer science and continuing education in that field as a doctoral student, Davani understood that if she wanted to make an impact, it was time to start asking tougher research questions and investigate how human biases can influence artificial intelligence identifiers of hate speech.
“There are usually some main questions, and there are different research groups that try to enhance the answer … [and] enhance the performance of a model,” Davani said. “But I was more generally interested in asking new questions and looking into different concepts that haven’t been explored.”
In her most recent work “Hatred is in the Eye of the Annotator: Hate Speech Classifiers Learn Human-like Social Stereotypes,” which she presented at the Cognitive Science Society conference in August, Davani and her coauthors found that AI models reflect the biases of the people who created and trained them to identify hate speech in a process called annotation.
“[We] figured out there are some kinds of social biases and human biases that lead to this kind of imbalanced data set and bias models,” Davani said. “There are a lot of disagreements annotating hate, and [we] want to know if it’s because different people have different views or different social biases about those groups.”
Discovering this phenomenon required a uniquely interdisciplinary approach. Leigh Yeh, a 2020 graduate of the master’s in computer science program who previously co-authored a similar paper with Davani, explained how the project demanded a variety of skill sets and perspectives — namely, psychology.
“We all work in social psychology, and we all work in social science and we’re all from a variety of backgrounds,” Yeh said. “I did not start off in computer science. My background is in cognitive science. But, I remembered I want to help my community. I want to learn about how people interact.”
Davani echoed this, explaining that she herself had to make adjustments in the way she took on these issues.
“We have different backgrounds, we have different questions that we want to answer,” she said. “So our knowledge is like different pieces of the puzzle — we have to trust each other … When it comes to, for example, social phenomena, it’s not my area of expertise, and I don’t like to go ahead and put my ideals which are just based on my observation but not based on some solid background.”
The issue of hate speech and AI has become more prevalent in recent years. In 2018, 53% of Americans reported facing online hate speech, with 37% reporting severe attacks such as stalking and sexual harassment, according to USA Today. Currently, there is no universal method of regulating hate speech on the internet.
This has led many computer scientists to devote more research into the problem. Morteza Dehghani, an associate professor of psychology and computer science and Davani’s mentor for the past four years, believes that her work is a key part of expanding upon this scientific literature.
“She’s bridging between the two fields in order to both bring in abilities that computer science models and analyses at large scale can tell us about human behavior, but then also complemented from top down theories that, for the past couple of decades, people have worked on and developed on how biases can lead to prejudice into these models,” Dehghani said. “She’s essentially found a very good sweet spot.”
While AI and its more technical aspects are often misunderstood by the public, Yeh believes that this research has the ability to make a real positive impact on people’s lives.
“There’s a lot of scary things being said about AI, and I would love the public to know that there is a lot of good that can come from AI,” Yeh said. “It just takes motivated, smart and caring and empathetic people to get in this field and really utilize these tools for the greater good.”
For now, Davani encourages people interested in the field to challenge themselves to be more creative and holistic with their approaches to their work and research.
“Maybe just spend more time and ask questions about the data that you have, or the main practices that are usual in your field,” she said. “Maybe there is something that is not being understood because there isn’t a collaboration or there’s other points of view to it. It’s very important to be able to ask questions before trying the common practice.”
