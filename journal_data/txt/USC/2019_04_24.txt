The Trojan Marching Band elected sophomore India Anderson as its drum major Tuesday. Anderson is the first woman to be elected to the position in the band’s 139-year history. 
A tuba performance major, Anderson joined the band her freshman year after marching with her high school band. She said the role of drum major involves leading the band onto the field before every football game and giving pep talks to the rest of the members.
“The band means a lot to me just in my life and I’m really honored that the band has chosen me to lead them,” Anderson said. “Being drum major is great to further give back to the band in service and dedication.”
According to Brett Padelford, the band’s director of public relations, the band has been officially co-ed since 1971, when director Arthur Bartner — who will be directing his 50th season in Fall 2019 — spearheaded the policy change. Since then, Padelford said there have been four female drum major candidates, including Anderson. 
Padelford said that in recent years, the band has seen more women matriculants than men. 
“This was the students’ decision and I’m happy gender was not an issue in the selection of the candidate,” Bartner wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “I congratulate India and look forward to her leadership of the band this coming football season.”
Padelford said the top four drum major candidates performed for the entire band Tuesday. After marching to the Fight Song, each candidate gave a speech. After that, the over-300 member band took a vote, and staff members counted the ballots. 
“She had a great rapport with the students,” Padelford said. “She’s not only a great musician, but I think she’ll make a great leader.”
Anderson said she was first introduced to the tuba when her high school band director “forced” her to play in that section. After playing at USC, Anderson said she has come to love playing the tuba, even though it is less popular, because it stands out from the other instruments.
She said she isn’t sure if she’ll run for re-election in Spring 2020, but will continue to play music for as long as she can. 
“Inside the band, I would just like to continue to be a leader and an image that people look up to,” Anderson said. “I hope that I can embody traits that the band values.”

On April 13, a group of close friends gathered to celebrate Victor McElhaney’s 22nd birthday. He had planned a lingerie party, with no rules as to how little could be worn. If showing up naked was what made his friends feel liberated, then he was all for it. 
They spent the next day the way McElhaney typically spent his Sundays — at Leimert Park participating in a community drum circle with local musicians and dancers. It was a weekend of freedom, self-expression, community and music — exactly how McElhaney would have liked it.
But he wasn’t there.
A month before his birthday, McElhaney, a student in the Thornton School of Music’s jazz studies program, was senselessly shot and killed by four muggers in a liquor store parking lot about a mile and a half off USC’s campus.
According to his mother Lynette, he’d just been trying to go to an art show. 
Born with rhythm
From the moment McElhaney could sit up, he was drumming. At three years old, he would only say two words when people asked how he was doing: “I drum.” 
Like a pilot flies a plane, a drummer steers a band. They keep everyone on a beat and highlight the individuality of the other musicians. Drummers accentuate the guitar riffs and highlight the horn section rhythm, all while staying in control as the backbone of the band. A drummer’s vitality affects the way everyone plays, and it keeps the musicians in sync. 
“He was born a drummer,” said Lynette, an Oakland city councilmember. 
Growing up in Oakland, McElhaney specialized in drums, particularly African drums called djembe. But at USC, he played different types of instruments, including the bongo and congas in an Afro-Cuban band. 
“There’s a funk element to him, and he was also swinging hard,” Thornton professor Aaron Serfaty said. “He understood the jazz tradition really well. But he was also a hip-hop artist, so he was like a mix of two things.”
Serfaty described McElhaney’s talents as a stew, as a unique blend of elements that complemented each other well. 
“He was an amazing musician,” said Syann Cromwell, a close friend and junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and African American studies and ethnicity. “Rhythm was his essence, was his body. Everything was music.” 
McElhaney was also the glue of his family. His mother described him as the bridge-builder, always bringing people together and keeping the family close. As Lynette’s only birth son, he grew up as the youngest of five siblings, raised alongside a half brother from his father’s first marriage and three children who Lynnette and her husband fostered as their own. 
“Even though he was the youngest, in many ways he was the big brother,” Lynette said. “[He was] very responsible at an early age and took those responsibilities to heart.”
McElhaney was always comfortable around his multigenerational family, whether it was talking to his great grandfather or playing with his 2-year-old baby cousin. He advocated for his cousins to his aunt and uncle, acting as a liaison when problems between them arose. 
“He was the warmth in every circle,” Lynette said. 
Creating conversation
But McElhaney’s life skipped a beat on Dec. 20, 2015, when his brother was shot and killed in Oakland. Torian Hughes had just turned 17. 
Lynette and her husband fostered Hughes’ mother for one year when she was a teenager, and kept a close relationship with her and her son. When Hughes was in second grade and Victor was in third, Hughes moved in with the McElhaneys for six years.
About four years after he moved out, Hughes was shot in an altercation while trying to buy a gun for protection.
“[Victor] bathed with, laughed with, fought with, cried with, conspired to change the world with [Torian],” Lynette said. “And he was violently taken from our family before he could even reach manhood.”
While grieving the loss of his best friend, McElhaney pondered the conditions of poverty and the importance of mental health. These contemplations were only a small part of his deeper meditation on life’s injustices and how he could challenge them through art. 
McElhaney’s passion for people and his investment in their goodness helped him build an inclusive community at USC. Soon after his passing, the University held a memorial at Ronald Tutor Campus Center. By the start of the service, the main ballroom overflowed with students of every race and background, from all corners of USC, coming together for one reason: “Vic.”
“If he saw you for five minutes, he would make that the most impactful five minutes he could with whatever he was doing with his day,” Cromwell said. “Even if he could only give you a hug, it would be the best hug that you had ever gotten.” 
One night, Cromwell and McElhaney were bouncing ideas off each other when she mentioned she wanted to do more with Ground Zero Performance Cafe, a performance space on campus where Cromwell is a production manager. Through conversation, they came up with the idea of an art and culture celebration called First Friday. McElhaney encouraged Cromwell to follow through with the concept and give it a shot. The monthly event began this semester at Ground Zero, and it will continue through next semester and beyond, Cromwell said. 
“That’s just Vic,” Cromwell said. “His personality was literally to help you. If he saw a potential in you to do something, he would push you to do it. He wanted his people to know that they’re very capable and that he believed in that, and in them.”
As a natural extrovert, McElhaney’s specialty was starting conversations. But he couldn’t just talk about the weather. 
“He was very thought-provoking in normal conversation,” said Samuel Reid, a junior majoring in jazz studies and a friend of McElhaney’s. “He wasn’t really down for small talk. Small talk with him would usually get very deep.”
 McElhaney was the co-director of Brothers Breaking B.R.E.A.D., a Black Student Assembly organization that welcomes black men into a community to foster black male leadership. He felt comfortable bringing up the big issues that people avoided, such as racism, homophobia and misogyny. He challenged people to give their opinions, but he gave them the opportunity to explain why they felt that way. He wanted to create spaces where people could discuss difficult issues and learn from each other. 
Through another brainstorming session with Cromwell, he decided to start showing movies followed by a discussion of its major themes. He organized a screening of “Moonlight” at Ground Zero, at which he fostered an open conversation about identity and breaking down barriers in the first installment of a series called “Keep Me Grounded.” It turned into an event that many students remembered and spoke about at McElhaney’s memorial. 
“We definitely plan to continue that event in his legacy,” Cromwell said. “He shaped how those events will happen and will continue to happen. The legacy that he left behind just in that was very important.” 
He even turned spaces that weren’t meant for conversation into opportunities to talk about social issues and hear diverse perspectives. During a Latin band rehearsal with Serfaty, McElhaney brought up race relations, and the multi-faceted conversation among his peers lasted for two hours. Not one note was played during that rehearsal — only students expressing their opinions, observations and concerns could be heard.
“He was passionate about it,” Serfaty said. “He was very articulate, very intelligent. And he was intense.”
Leading by example
McElhaney enrolled at USC with the intent of studying afromusicology and the beginnings of both humanity and music. He was passionate about diving into his African roots and understanding the power of drumming vibrations to heal and connect people. He had one goal for his music: to change the world. 
For most, that’s a lofty goal that is often viewed as unrealistic. It’s in the back of everyone’s minds as an ideal they’ll never admit for fear of looking naive, looking dumb. But McElhaney said it out loud. He made it known because he knew it was going to happen. 
“I always thought he was 35 years old, the way he carried himself and the way he had formulated his approach to life,” Serfaty said. 
Serfaty noticed his confidence right away. McElhaney transferred to USC in Fall 2017 from Cal State East Bay with more musical experience than most other freshmen. He was never afraid to do things his way, but he was also aware of his natural leadership during rehearsals. When he started practicing and preparing early, soon enough the whole class followed suit. 
“He is going to change the world,” Thornton professor Peter Erskine said. “He’s going to make us all fight for less instruments of violence in our communities, in our cities.”
Gone too soon
When her son was killed, Lynette was in shock. 
“The night Victor was killed, I felt like someone had ripped every bone through my body,” Lynette said. “I couldn’t stand.”
Two days later, Lynette called for her son’s shooter to come forward at a news conference in Los Angeles after police told Lynette that they weren’t expecting the killer to turn themselves in. Lynette didn’t believe it or want it to be true.
But more than a month since the shooting, no suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made.
“Come forward,” Lynette said. “Get yourself some help. You need to be arrested until you stop hurting yourself and hurting others.”
She hopes the murderer feels enough remorse and guilt to come forward and seek help. Society never invested in her son’s murderer, she said, and that created a monster. 
“And the monster took my baby,” Lynette said.

Interim President Wanda Austin announced several changes to the athletic admissions process after the Justice Department launched an investigation into the University last month, according to a memo sent to the USC community Wednesday. 
The Department of Justice investigation followed an FBI investigation that revealed a college bribery scheme in which 33 wealthy parents paid to have their children admitted to universities like USC, UCLA, Yale and Stanford under false pretenses. 
“While we continue to cooperate with the government’s investigation, and while our own investigation led by the Office of Professionalism and Ethics remains ongoing, USC has greatly strengthened its process for reviewing applications of prospective student-athletes, effective this month,” Austin wrote.
The changes include more oversight in the student-athlete admissions process that the University will implement for student athletes considered for admission for the 2019-20 academic year, Austin wrote. 
Student athlete applications will now be reviewed by a head coach, senior sports administrator overseeing the team and the Office of Athletics Compliance before they are sent to the admissions staff, the memo said. 
According to the FBI investigation, former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, former water polo coach Jovan Vavic and former soccer coaches Ali Khosroshahin and Laura Janke helped create fake athletic profiles for the children of wealthy parents to ensure admission to USC. The students, who were admitted as athletic recruits, never played the sports for which they were accepted. 
Each team’s head coach will then confirm in writing that each student has been recruited for their athletic ability, the memo said. At the beginning and end of each academic year, each team’s athletic roster will be audited and checked with admissions lists,  the memo read. 
“Ensuring the integrity of our admissions process remains a top priority of University leadership,” Austin wrote. “I appreciate the patience of our community as we continue to work toward making our University stronger.”
The memo also provided an update on the students currently enrolled in the University who are tied to the bribery scheme. According to the memo, students have been notified of a review of their admissions status through Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards and most have completed their initial interviews. 
“The possible outcomes range from no finding of violation to revocation of admission and will depend on the facts of each case,” Austin wrote.    
The memo said though the University is being investigated by the Department of Justice for its student-athlete admissions process, USC’s internal investigation will “examine the wider scope of how students gain admittance to the University.”

As more people drop their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services, it has grown evident that the way audiences consume sports has changed drastically. Live sports has kept  the cable industry intact; after all, sports is one of the few forms of entertainment that can’t be binged and require appointment viewing.
Still, live sports alone hasn’t kept people from cancelling their cable subscriptions. According to Bloomberg, “Every minute, another six people cut the cord.” Instead of paying for cable, people have chosen to sign up for a variety of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu or Amazon. The inclusion of channels like ESPN or Fox Sports in cable packages used to be enough retain diehard sports fans, but that does not seem to be the case anymore. ESPN, once viewed as an indestructible behemoth, lost two million subscribers in 2018, according to The Hill. 
I experienced this shift for the first time this year. As a superfan of college football and pretty much every other sport (with the exception of baseball, apologies to Sam Arslanian), I assumed I would always need cable to watch games from the SEC to the Pac-12. But for the first time in my life, I didn’t have cable in my room, and so I turned to a variety of streams, both legal and otherwise. 
To be honest, it’s nice not having to pay for cable. But being a sports fan and not having cable makes for an exhausting venture. 
Streams are often unreliable, and the situation is made even worse by the notorious USC Wi-Fi. I’ve had games cut out right before game-tying field goals or vital free throws, as was the case during a Final Four game a couple weeks ago. Also, with people using a variety of streaming services, it’s become impossible to tell who is really watching the game live. I experienced this first-hand during Game 5 of the World Series, when a former friend barged in and spoiled the game’s last out. The possibility of “spoiling” sporting events was unheard of in the cable-era, but now it’s a real issue to be wary of, apparently. 
Adding to the annoyance, setting up streams seems for sporting events seems to take days, especially for high-profile events. By the time I established a stable connection to watch this year’s College Football Playoff National Championship, Clemson had already amassed a sizable lead, extinguishing any drama. It would have been wiser to try and get a table at Buffalo Wild Wings. 
In the streaming era, there’s also the common nuisance of having to switch between too many different streaming services. In the past, going from an NBA game on TNT to a college football contest on SEC Network required a few clicks of a remote. In this daunting new age, that becomes a 10-minute task, just to switch apps and sign into the new one. It’s now far more convenient to stick with one streaming service for an extended period of time, rather than channel-surfing to catch all of the day’s biggest sporting events. 
The advent of new technologies was supposed to make our lives simpler, but now there’s an overload of avenues to sports consumption. There needs to be a more centralized way for sports fans to watch sports outside of the overpriced, traditional cable model. 
A few companies are trying to transition live sports broadcasts into the new age. ESPN launched its ESPN+ streaming service a year ago, with a price tag of $4.99 a month. It’s an attractive price, and the company possesses a deep library of content, but the app’s dearth of actual live sports is a detracting point. 
Hulu might actually have the best shot at attracting sports fans. For $44.99 a month, users of Hulu TV gain access to sports channels like ESPN, CBS and regional Fox Sports networks all in one stop. It’s not cheap, but compared to paying $85-100 for cable, it’s a solid deal. 
Still, Hulu TV does not solve the root of the problem for sports fans; they still have to pay for unwanted channels such as Freeform or Oxygen (these channels were picked at random, and I apologize to any fans of the NBA and Pretty Little Liars). There needs to be a service that supplies all the major sports channels in one spot for a flat fee to end all this app-switching and bundling madness. 
With or without cable subscriptions, sports fans will always find ways to consume live events. Often, this is through illegal streams on Reddit, where people can find links to the exact game they want to watch. Unless broadcasting companies want to continue losing out to this alternative, it’d be wise for them to figure out how to adapt to the streaming age, while retaining the convenience cable offers. 
Every year for my column, I do a mock of what I think will happen in the first ten picks of the NFL Draft. Last year, I correctly picked three of the first ten picks, so naturally the goal is to double that total this time around. Let’s get started. 
 No. 1 Arizona Cardinals: Kyler Murray, QB Oklahoma 
No. 2 San Francisco 49ers: Nick Bosa, DE Ohio State 
No. 3 New York Jets: Josh Allen, DE Kentucky 
No. 4 Oakland Raiders: Quinnen Williams, DT Alabama 
No. 5 Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Ed Oliver, DT Houston 
No. 6 New York Giants: Dwayne Haskins, QB Ohio State 
No. 7 Jacksonville Jaguars: Jawann Taylor, T Florida 
No. 8 Detroit Lions: Rashan Gary, DE Michigan 
No. 9 Buffalo Bills: Andre Dillard, T Washington State 
No. 10 Denver Broncos: Drew Lock, QB Missouri

For many people, the idea of waking up at the crack of dawn to swim, bike and run for many miles seems ridiculous. 
But take it from Sarah Soutoul, the vice president of USC’s club triathlon team: It’s as daunting as you would expect when you first start doing it, but it gets easier under the right circumstances. 
“I never thought I would wake up at 4 a.m. to go work out, but my determination grew,” said Soutoul, a senior majoring in journalism, sitting in the stands at Cromwell Field as her teammates wrapped up their final practice of the season. “But triathlon is a mindset, and it has really helped me evolve on a personal level.”
The triathlon team was founded in 2002 by six students. Since then, the team has expanded to average between 70 and 100 members per year, seeing more growth particularly in the last five years. 
And with growth comes improved competitive ability. The club is part of the West Coast Collegiate Triathlon Conference, currently ranking in the middle of the pack in one of the best collegiate triathlon conferences in the United States. The club travels to scenic spots across California to compete, and had just returned from the USA Triathlon National Championship in Tempe, Ariz., where it finished 23rd out of over 100 teams. The team also competes in full-distance triathlons around the world and has earned sponsorships from companies like Clif Bar and InCycle.
The members competing in Nationals were selected for their commitment: Only those who showed up to practice time after time got the nod. But there’s something special about this club that makes people want to force themselves to wake up early, pack into crowded cars for hours on end and push their bodies through one of the most physically draining sports.
Balancing fun and competition
The team is far from a competitive, cutthroat environment. Anyone with experience in running, swimming or biking can join and is welcome to push as hard as they want. 
The team also functions as a social club with a familial atmosphere and regular team social events, including its annual fall retreat to locations such as Big Bear and Lake Arrowhead. 
“We pick places where we can train but also have fun,” Soutoul said. “We get to do something other than training: bonding, cooking, talking about our lives. It gives us a chance to get to know each other personally.”
However, there are high expectations for effort level when training and competing; the social aspect can be a way to fight through the pain.
“Our approach is to give 100% at the workouts and races,” said public relations chair Prithviraj Prabhu, a graduate student studying electrical engineering. “But we chill and bond right before and after.”
Team members said this relentless drive to improve doesn’t hamper team morale, however.
“The difficulty of the sport forces you to get motivation from the people around you,” Prabhu said. “It’s special to be a part of this group.”
In a sport as taxing as triathlon, Soutoul said it is important to stay positive to keep team morale high.
“It’s a painful sport, but the team makes it fun and easy to do,” she said. “Seeing the team have fun helps.”
Of course, with the fun comes the less exciting realities of maintaining a team. The club receives little funding from the University, so it holds fundraising events with the help of its sponsors. The club requires a lot of organization, which explains the 13-member executive board with responsibilities ranging from handling merchandise to philanthropy events. 
“We’re entirely student-run so we use volunteers and get a high level of activity,” said team president Calum Rickard, a fourth-year doctoral student studying applied math. “We need manpower, so we have a lot of positions.”
With the end of the semester and triathlon season quickly approaching, many of the team’s senior leaders, such as Rickard and Soutoul, will be departing soon. That leaves the future of the team’s leadership in flux. However, Soutoul said the team’s executive board is trying to set a good example for the team’s aspiring leaders. 
“It’s important to be on top of everything not only to make new members more comfortable, but to make them want to be leaders later,” she said.
A diverse array of students
It can be hard for international students to feel comfortable at U.S. colleges. The triathlon team, however, is home to myriad international students, all the way up to its executive board.
Rickard, Soutoul and Prabhu are all international students who got involved with the club as a way to meet people.
“I didn’t know anyone when I got here, but triathlon was how I met my friends,” Rickard said. “Now one of my roommates is a triathlete that I met here. It goes beyond the sport.”
Soutoul, who is from Cannes, France, said she was able to connect with the other members of the club because she found people like her. 
“As a transfer student, I used my interest in sports to meet people, and I felt really welcome at my first practice,” she said. “I just found people like me. Most of my best friends are from the team, and I spend most of my time with them.”
Prabhu, a native of Chennai, India, said the the team’s under-the-radar status makes it more inviting to international students.
“It’s not like football recruiters who go out and find the players,” he said. “[The club] can be a place for international students to find their own home.”
The opportunity to meet a diverse set of people goes beyond nationality, Soutoul said. According to Soutoul, a fair amount of the team is made up of STEM majors.
“I met Ph.D. students as an undergrad and STEM students I wouldn’t have had the chance to meet otherwise,” she said. “Our team members are ambitious, and it’s cool to be around other driven people.”
Creating a family
Triathlon certainly isn’t a spectator sport; it takes a long time to travel to meets, and it is largely a solitary competition. That means all the support comes from within the team.
“We’re just a lot of friendly individuals who bond through triathlon,” Rickard said. “The time we spend with each other, it makes us a family.”
The long hours spent together inevitably leads to some pretty special memories.
“I got a bike four months after I joined the team, and two months after one of my good friends invited me on a really long bike ride,” Prabhu said. “I was expecting something 40, 50 miles maximum, but we went on a 70-mile ride. It was like a six-hour ride, and we were just strolling through the canyons just looking at all the views. That was really memorable for me.”
Soutoul remembers her last collegiate race at Nationals during the final leg of a mixed-gender relay mini-triathlon.
“I was last in our group, so as I was approaching the finish line everyone was lined up cheering,” Soutoul said. “It was a great feeling.”
The team certainly resembled a normal collegiate athletic club at Nationals; Rickard recalls the team doing the SoCal Spellout and singing the Fight Song. They even came dressed up for a motorbikers theme, sporting wifebeaters and leather jackets. But this type of camaraderie isn’t necessarily common throughout the sport.
“It’s a unique way of doing triathlon because it’s usually so individualistic,” Rickard said. 
Despite the individualistic nature, the club has a team dynamic that pushes everyone to improve.
“Maybe you wouldn’t care about other people’s performances because you’re really competing against yourself,” Soutoul said. “But we give support, we’re not competitive with each other. This is something I will miss when I graduate, maybe the only thing. It’s going to be hard when I have to train on my own.”

No. 14 USC Lacrosse clinches regular season Conference title while honoring their seniors. 
USC women’s lacrosse rounded out its regular season play with a dominant 16-10 win over conference rival Arizona State to clinch the top seed for the Pac-12 Tournament. 
In what has become a team trend, USC was slow out of the gates, scoring its first goal 10 minutes into gameplay. However, the first goal opened the scoring floodgates; the Trojans outscored the Sun Devils 13-4 in the first half. Junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller led the Trojans with 4 goals, all from free-position shots. 
All four seniors being honored for their final home game started and had impressive performances for USC.
Senior defender Jackie Gilbert broke the school record for draw possession, collecting 17 on the day. Gilbert and the USC draw circle dominated the entire game: The final draw tally was 20-8 in USC’s favor. 
Gilbert has the 17th- most draw controls in the NCAA. This was the fourth time this season that she collected more than 10 in one game. Gilbert also had three ground balls and a caused turnover. 
Senior attacker Emily Concialdi added 3 goals, as well as her fourth hat trick of the year, for the Trojans in her final game at McAlister Field. Concialdi ends the regular season with 41 points, the second most on the team. 
Senior attackers Amanda Flayhan and Gabbi Klein made an impact as well. Flayhan had a goal and an assist, while Klein scored her first goal of the season and assisted on 2 other goals. 
The seniors were announced and presented with framed jerseys in a pre-game ceremony. 
“It’s a special moment to celebrate the seniors who put in four years of hard work, today was all about them,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. 
The Trojans are now one step closer to achieving their preseason goal of winning the Pac-12 Championship. The team is also a near lock to compete in the NCAA Tournament. 
“Luckily, it’s not over for us [and] we get a chance to compete for the conference championship, Munday said. “It’s great that we won the regular season, but we need to focus on our next game.”
This senior class is the final remaining connection to USC’s first varsity lacrosse team in 2011. This year’s seniors included players from the original team in 2011. Munday said he is thankful for the work ethic of this class in particular.
“They are special being a part of the group that had to buy into USC before the program had really had any success,” Munday said. “As a coach, I’m really grateful for their belief and buy-in.”
This senior class was able to navigate this team to a 14-3 record the year after a disappointing 10-8 finish that put them out of the running for the NCAA Tournament last season. 
This team boasts a stout defense, a balanced offensive attack with a medley of chaos-creating midfielders. 
USC had four players score 40 or more points for them this season. The biggest surprise of the season was the low scoring production from Miller, last year’s leader in points scored. Miller went scoreless in eight of the team’s 17 regular season games. 
After scoring 36 goals in each of her first two seasons with the Trojans, Miller was limited to only 20 goals all season. Her shot percentage also dropped below .400 for the first time in her career.  
However, Miller remained extremely productive and valuable to the Trojans, leading the team in ground balls and caused turnovers. 
USC will compete in the Pac-12 Tournament in Eugene, Ore. this weekend. They will play at 4:30 p.m. Friday against the winner of Thursday’s game between Arizona State and Cal.

It was nearing 9:30 p.m. Friday night at the Hammer Museum. Excited murmurs rose and fell as all around the room, college students waited eagerly, dressed in their assorted GOLF vests and donning crudely dyed hair. After several opening acts, the night was drawing to a close. Suddenly, the crowd erupted in cheers as baby-faced rock star Dominic Fike took the stage. 
Even though he has only six songs to his name, Fike managed to sign a multimillion-dollar contract with Columbia Records and has garnered praise from  industry titans like Diplo and Brockhampton, both of whom showed their support at the concert. And most importantly, Fike has built a strong and devoted fan base almost overnight.
Yet, for those who saw him perform live for the first time, the artist’s talent wasn’t immediately noticeable. Though his vocal performance was strong and the songs infectious, Fike’s apparent lack of enthusiasm left fans disengaged. Unlike most artists, however, he owned up to this shortcoming. Onstage, Fike admitted he hates performing largely because he is tired of these same six songs.
The show was also riddled with technical issues that were not only distracting, but also clearly frustrating for Fike. At one point, he even yelled, “Stop, stop, stop. I’m done,” before taking off his guitar and walking offstage. However, he returned immediately and said he was joking. 
From that moment on, the artist engaged with fans much more intimately. He played highly adapted versions of his songs, each one clearly distinct from the studio versions.
And between every few songs shouts of “Jada Pinkett” would cut through the room from either side of the crowd. Either those yelling in the crowd had been fans of Dominic Fike since his early Florida days or had liked his current music enough to seek out his catalog. 
Whether he was flattered by his fans’ commitment or excited to perform a song that felt less worn out, Fike eventually attempted to perform the track. To the chagrin of many fans, however, Fike failed, as he could not find the backing track.
Instead, he played an unreleased track. The highlight of the evening, Fike’s new song deviated enough from his current style to feel fresh but just similar enough to be distinctly Dominic Fike. The song underscored Fike’s songwriting talent better than any track on his EP “Don’t Forget About Me, Demos.” In fact, some parts of the track felt like they were more reminiscent of Fike’s pre-Columbia days. Yet, he still showcased his effortlessly smooth and powerful singing voice.  
More than at any other moment in the night, the energy of the room was palpable at the sound of Fike’s newest tune. At last, he seemed to truly enjoy performing as he enchanted the crowd, which oscillated between jumping excitedly and swooning uncontrollably. The lyrics felt sincere and dealt directly with his time in jail.
Despite the technical difficulties, delayed start and Fike’s disengagement, the concert was worth it, as it led to Fike presenting something he was proud of to his fans. 
After finishing his set, Dominic Fike — perhaps naively — said he would hang around for a while and grab drinks with people who were interested. In that exact moment, however, the crowd recognized the members of Brockhampton standing on the sideline and decided to bum rush both them and Fike. In the midst of shoving and jumping over chairs and tables, Brockhampton and Dominic were quickly escorted out. 
And suddenly it was quiet again. The sea of bodies quickly dissipated, and only the cold air and the anticipation for future performances were left.

The hardest part of a story to write is the conclusion — just ask any journalist. We’ll lazily tack on an articulate quote to do the work for us or spend hours composing a punchy closing line that lingers in our readers’ minds. As my time as a USC student and Daily Trojan columnist comes to an end, perhaps it’s why I’ve been dreading writing the ending to my own story, my final column. 
Coming to USC, I knew I was on a mission to identify my passions and chase the life I wanted with reckless abandon. The trouble was, I didn’t know what those passions were yet. A starry-eyed freshman, riding the buzz of studying abroad and starving with blind ambition, I became obsessed with making lists and planning my future (only later would I realize how futile that is). My Notes app is still stocked with catalogs of goals, reminders, assorted passwords and checklists of organizations to join — now relics of my former self. 
Over the years, most of those dreams have been discarded for grander ones. I didn’t end up minoring in business or becoming the president of the pre-law fraternity. I never interned at NBCUniversal or covered breaking news on-air. But that’s OK, because those were the bygone dreams of a girl who didn’t know who she was or what she wanted yet. Now that I am that person, I couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunities this newspaper and this column have given me to become her. 
The only thing I was as sure of then as I am now is that I needed to join the Daily Trojan. I applied to be a staff writer on the first day of classes and relished seeing my words in print every week. My editors unremittingly sent me across campus and across town to exhibitions and shows, leading me to inadvertently catch the art writing bug. After one fateful afternoon spent badgering curators and praying my iPhone photos would suffice, I was hooked. It was love at first byline. I haven’t looked back since. 
All of a sudden, my passions made sense, and a new set of dreams bloomed before me. And since then, I’ve done things and published stories freshman me would never have dreamed of. I eventually added a minor in visual culture — a subject that enchants me every day more than business ever could — and embarked on freelancing gigs, some of which brought me face to face with contemporary greats like Ai Weiwei. From profiling emerging artists to reviewing major exhibitions in L.A., it’s been a thrill to gradually grow into my own skin and document it all in ink.
Aside from being the reason I’m jokingly called an art hoe every other week, this column has been everything to me. I remember feeling like a fraud two months into writing it because I was afraid I’d run out of hot takes (alright, maybe they were lukewarm at best) or that I’d realize I was hardly qualified to preach about the complexities of the abstruse art world. But week after week, my ardor for the topic propelled me to keep wondering, learning and writing. I was driven by my fellow editors who supported me unconditionally, the professors who assigned my columns as course reading much to my bewilderment and the thousands of untold stories throughout art history that beckon and intrigue me. Looking back, “State of the Art” is one of the best things I’ve done at USC. 
It’s the reason I sit wide-eyed in every art history lecture, probing the words and images on the screen for a spark of inspiration (roughly 900 words worth). It gave me an excuse to spend hours scouring museum websites and allowed me to effortlessly keep a pulse on contemporary arts and culture. It’s grounded me in my passions and kept me sane when my GE and communication theory classes felt cursory by comparison. It’s why I challenge myself to dig deeper into every concept or phenom and search for meaningful connections between art and my own life. It has given me a cathartic platform to air my grievances and process my own psyche when I felt like I’d surely implode otherwise. 
Staring down the prospect of graduation, two weeks out and one year early, I am possessed by an odd, hollow nostalgia (as well as an equal and opposite lack of motivation to complete my remaining assignments). My time at USC was a five-semester blur of deadlines and laughs in the Daily Trojan newsroom, spontaneous field trips to the Arts District and more blissful nights with friends spent chasing our youth than I can count or recall. I’ll even treasure all the Monday nights I spent procrastinating and later panicking over this column. 
Interestingly enough, there is one list freshman me created that I have completed. Armed with my lifelong zeal for museums, I planned to fall in love with Los Angeles through its arts institutions and cultural hotspots. Slowly but surely, I checked places off my list over the semesters and never would have imagined that I’d be employed by some of them. That ache to discover and engage with art set me free and gave me a sense of purpose heading into the next chapter of my life. I knew I was onto something back then — and look what it’s led to.
Catherine Yang is a senior writing about art and visual culture. She is also the digital managing editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “State of the Art,” ran every other Wednesday.

Last week, USC Forward, a coalition composed of USC students, faculty members and community residents, held numerous demonstrations on campus advocating for accountability from USC leaders. In a time when the University is mired in numerous scandals, USC’s weak promises of change are beyond concerning. Tangible reform needs to take place at this institution, especially regarding accessibility. 
USC’s leaders need to focus on admissions for local low-income and first-generation students and allocate funds for scholarships for a designated number of them. 
Efforts to do so, including USC-run charter high schools, have fallen short, and programs like the Trojan Transfer Plan prioritize legacy admissions over local students who are just as qualified.
A proposal like this one for a “quota” of accepted low-income and first-generation students toes the line of affirmative action and constitutional legitimacy. 
However, the upper-middle class is still substantially over-represented in American public universities, including USC. A 2017 New York Times study found that the median income of a USC student’s family is $161,400, and that 63% of students come from the top 20% of society. 
Despite having one of the largest financial aid pools in the country, USC does not guarantee free or heavily discounted tuition for students from lower-income brackets — only 2.2% of undergraduate scholarship aid is granted through the University’s endowment. 
In addition to providing more opportunities for local students, USC should consider eliminating Trojan Transfer programs and reallocate those spots to low-income and first-generation students. 
Participants of the Trojan Transfer Plan are selected based on their ties to the university such as legacy status or being the child of an employee; this year, more than 400 legacy transfer students enrolled at USC. According to a report by Annenberg Media, many have some sort of connection to the University. 
Admission programs like this raise questions about transparency and unfair processes regarding  USC admissions. These two programs should be eliminated in favor of allocating spots and encouraging pipelines for low-income and first-generation students.
While the University has tried to address this issue, these efforts still fall short in truly addressing socioeconomic inequality. In 2012, the Rossier School of Education founded a charter management organization called Ednovate, operating five high-performing charter schools, touting a “100% graduation rate with a 100% college-acceptance rate.” 
However, these charter schools host their own issues that hinder students from success.
One online reviewer of East College Prep, which is operated by Ednovate, cited discrimination against teachers and students as one of the many issues plaguing the school. Rossier also attempted to turn around Crenshaw High School in 2007. The Wall Street Journal reported that the partnership dissolved after five years, citing frustration with the district’s oversight, disrespectful student behavior and different sets of goals among stakeholders, including balancing immediate test-score gains against community support of the school’s culture.
The University fails to prioritize students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and USC’s partnerships with Ednovate, QuestBridge and other initiatives are simply not enough. 
To foster lasting change in modern education, USC must consider eliminating programs that favor legacy students and focus instead on giving low-income and first-generation students more financial support.

From lawsuits filed against former campus doctors for sexual abuse to the college admissions scandal, USC has been ladened with countless issues. Just a little over a week ago, multiple activist groups, headed by the coalition USC Forward, have banded together to address some of these issues. The groups are calling for USC to take responsibility for its actions and provide assistance in a wide set of problems including admissions for low-income LAUSD students and support for displaced residents in the area surrounding the University’s campuses. 
While the group targets numerous key issues, one in particular stands out: housing. In an effort to rebuild the relationships USC has with the surrounding community, the University should deal with its own housing issues and prevent the problem at its source.
First, the protestors are calling upon administration to provide affordable housing for existing and displaced residents impacted by the expansion of its University Park and Health Sciences campuses, including the USC Village expansion project, new graduate school buildings and the surge in prices for student accommodations. The rising cost of living negatively impacts residents of South Los Angeles, stirring tensions between the University and the community.
While USC does need to spend some time remediating the effects and providing aid to community members, it must first address its overwhelming problem of both affordable and adequate housing for students on campus. Currently, the University can only support a small percentage of its student population, with only 30% living in USC-owned or operated property, according to the 2019 U.S. News USC profile. Compared to other Los Angeles universities, these statistics are disappointing: 48% of students live in campus housing at UCLA and 53% at Loyola Marymount University, according to their respective U.S. News profiles. Additionally, USC Housing is only guaranteed for freshmen and sophomores who applied as freshmen, with upperclassmen having to enter a lottery system to be guaranteed campus housing.
To combat the lack of campus housing for students and the consequent inflation of neighborhood housing costs, USC needs to increase the amount of housing it offers to students. USC should look to acquire private enterprises that already house students in the area. The University can surely afford this, having raised over $6.9 billion for University functions ranging from scholarships to development projects, according to the University’s 2018 financial report. USC Village construction is complete, but if the University continues to fundraise, it may lead them toward acquiring more student housing.
Located just half a block away from USC Village, University Gateway is an example of a prime location to take over. With 421 units, the building can roughly house more than 1,600 students. By purchasing this eight-story complex, which was acquired for more than $200 million by a Wisconsin public employees pension fund in 2012, USC would gain a substantial amount of housing that is close to campus and also appeals to students.
Converting complexes farther away from USC and providing transportation from those areas to USC is another viable option. This solution would allow the University to create more affordable housing. Chapman University has already done this by purchasing an apartment building and a hotel complex, each about 10 minutes away from its main campus. By purchasing more student housing, USC would incentivize students to live at University-owned structures. Students will no longer turn to privately owned off-campus housing options and rent costs will lower as student demand lessens. Local residents cannot afford the rent prices students are charged, but if the University provides more housing options for students under its own regulation, South L.A.’s housing costs could stabilize.
In essence, the effort USC can undertake to increase and improve campus housing will have a domino effect on both its students and the greater L.A. community. The University should prevent the displacement of local residents, and actually be a good neighbor for once.

Sustainability is one of my favorite words. The environment is basically my favorite topic. I love spreading the word and sharing what I’ve learned about climate change. I hope this passion has come across in my column. 
So far, we’ve looked at the minute choices we’re often faced with. Should you wear contacts or glasses? Should you hand wash your dishes or put them in the dishwasher? Should you drive 10 miles to buy that shirt in person or have it shipped to your house? 
These are just a few of the choices that we make each day that have an impact on our environment. They’re small things, but we have power over them. 
But there’s one thing we seemingly have no power over: the big policies that run our world. In terms of the way lawmakers are thinking about climate change, there are two main ways to go about saving our planet: mitigation or adaptation. 
Mitigation is changing our habits not only individually but also as a society to reduce climate change and its effects. It’s about decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are released into our atmosphere by changing the way we live our daily  lives. 
As the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change puts it in a 2014 report: “Mitigation is a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.”
“Enhancing the sinks” for greenhouse gases means increasing systems that already naturally inhibit those emissions. For example, the ocean, forests and soil naturally take carbon dioxide out of the air and store it. So, cutting down the forests isn’t exactly helping this effort. 
Mitigation is by no means a one-person job. The IPCC report notes that greenhouse gas emissions mix in the atmosphere globally, so having one nation cut back on its emissions is not cobducive to curbing climate change.
Rather, curbing climate change needs to be a global effort. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are already dangerously high, and these emissions are affecting our world. 
Carbon dioxide — the heat-trapping gas that’s responsible for much of the planet’s warming — stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Even if we stopped emitting 100% of greenhouse gases today, climate change would still occur.
That’s where adaptation comes in. Adaptation is exactly what it sounds like — adapting to the already changing climate. Rather than being diametrically opposed as they’re sometimes presented, mitigation and adaptation must be implemented hand in hand.  
Through adaptation, we can reduce our vulnerability to the effects of the changing climate, which include rising sea levels, food insecurity and more intense and frequent weather. 
Though climate change is a global issue, its effects are felt locally. Municipalities will need to improve flood defenses, plan for heat waves and wildfires and improve stormwater capture systems, among taking other precautions.
As the NASA website on climate change notes, our planet’s climate has been stable for 12,000 years. That stability was crucial in giving civilizations a chance to grow and thrive, including ours.
“Modern life is tailored to the stable climate we have become accustomed to. As our climate changes, we will have to learn to adapt,” the website states. “The faster the climate changes, the harder it could be.”
Keeping that stability is essential to the survival of human life. But the truth of the matter is, it doesn’t matter which policy options are best if politicians don’t institute them. 
That’s where our power as individuals lies. We should be putting people in office who are aware of these issues, and are aware of the fact that this is perhaps the most pressing issue of our time. 
It’s no longer possible to carry on “business as usual.” We must start mitigation immediately, and employ adaptation policy to deal with the fallout of our already detrimental actions. It’s critical for the future of our planet and the future of humanity.

Community activists, Los Angeles officials and individuals who have experienced homelessness joined in conversation with one another Tuesday to discuss policy initiatives and the impact of poverty. The event, titled “A conversation about LA’s homeless crisis,” was hosted by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professors Mary Murphy and Sandy Tolan. 
According to the most recent records from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, 50,000 Angelenos are currently experiencing homelessness. Around 9% of four-year undergraduate students in the U.S. have reported that they experienced homelessness in 2018. 
Tolan began the event by introducing the students who organized the event and their two-year project on homelessness reporting. The projects included stories of people facing evictions, individuals living in their cars and even a USC student’s struggles with remaining in a stable housing unit. 
Murphy mentioned her advocacy work with the homelessness initiative, which specifically centers its efforts on Skid Row. 
“I’ve been volunteering in Skid Row for 30 years, I’ve been volunteering for people experiencing homeless,” Murphy said. “This kind of panel where we have people who have experienced homelessness, people who are trying to solve the problem, this communion, this conversation is part of the answer.”
Panelist Diana Cruz was the first individual to share her experience with homelessness, particularly with evictions. She said her situation is not unusual; however, there continues to be limited resources and a lack of support for her as well as others.
“When I was young, [my family] was facing no fault eviction,” Cruz said. “Last year, the landlord served us another no fault eviction … If you don’t know what your resources are or if you are unable to put in the time to find these resources, your options are extremely limited.”
Craig Mitchell, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge and founder of the Skid Row Running Club described his organization as an opportunity for individuals to come together and form a community between people who experience homelessness and homelessness advocates. 
“[The club] provides a sense of community … They are estranged from their family, they have destroyed relationships in the process,” Mitchell said. “One of the fundamental things that all human beings needs is relationships. … [The program] is a partnership of people like me who are not [experiencing homelessness] and people who are.”
Janet Kim, representative of the SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, said that the program was established as a way to get to know the homeless community as well as break barriers and stigma surrounding the issue. 
“There’s all these things that we don’t think about that we take for granted [such as] mailing services, or internet, or electricity or transportation,” Kim said. “There’s a lot of misinformation as to the kinds of people experiencing homelessness — ‘Oh they don’t want to work’ or ‘Oh they’re all mentally ill,” and that’s just not true.”
Panelist Demetri Bryant, who has experienced homelessness in the Los Angeles area, said that people who have dealt with the same conditions have to advocate for themselves because no one else in the community cares enough to advocate for their rights. 
“When you’re a homeless person you need to be proactive,” Bryant said. “You need to be making an effort to do for yourself, and you can’t sit around waiting for people to do stuff for you because they won’t.” 
Murphy ended the panel by discussing the responsibility that journalists and students have to be aware of the homeless community.
“For journalists, one of the reason we did this class … is because this is a priority for journalists —  we have to expose this, we have to write about it,” Murphy said. 
Kelly Chung, a junior majoring in business administration, said that listening to different perspectives on the issue of homelessness provided helpful insight.
“I thought it was really helpful to get different perspectives from people who are working in politics, from people working in nonprofits and for the people [who have] experienced homelessness themselves,” Chung said.

Los Angeles Unified School Board District 5 candidate Heather Repenning came to University Park Campus Tuesday to hold a press conference in response to the national college admissions scandal. She spoke about her plan to collect money from the various defendants in the scheme to benefit underserved students like those in her district.
Repenning, 44, is running for the seventh board seat in a special runoff election against Jackie Goldberg, 74, who failed to earn 50% of the vote in the March 5 primary. According to L.A. School Report, Repenning’s platform is more reform-based than that of Goldberg, who is endorsed by United Teachers Los Angeles. 
“I’m running for this board because I care deeply that all students and all families have access to good schools, including higher education,” Repenning said. “The college admissions scandal has pointed out how deeply unfair the system is.”
Repenning spoke about her plan to form a college access fund for parents and universities involved in the scheme to contribute to. The fund would benefit test prep, scholarships and counselor hiring for LAUSD students. 
“I think that USC could be part of that fund,” Repenning said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “[It] could certainly partner with our local high schools … even if we had some of the graduate students here or even undergrads helping with this counseling gap.” 
A former aide to L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, Repenning said the high school requirements in her district do not currently match state university requirements, making it harder for students to meet admissions standards when applying to colleges. 
“I didn’t come to USC right after high school, I had to [go to] community college,” said Miriham Antonio, a junior who delivered opening remarks for Repenning’s press conference. “One of the reasons being that the resources weren’t there at LAUSD to help prepare me to go into a university like USC right after high school.” 
Repenning said colleges like USC need to investigate their admissions processes to ensure no one receives privileges because of their wealth or status. 
“They need to look at their legacy admissions programs, they need to look at their sports programs, and they need to look at how they’re providing financial aid,” she said in her speech, “so that our students who are working so hard in our public schools have a real chance at getting into those colleges.”
Daniel Hahm contributed to this report.

Former USC women’s assistant soccer coach Laura Janke and San Diego businessman Toby MacFarlane will plead guilty Tuesday for their involvement in the college admissions bribery scheme, according to a memo from the Department of Justice. 
Janke, who worked at the University from 2007 to 2014, will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering due to her involvement in creating false athletic profiles for students whose parents bribed athletics officials. MacFarlane, who paid $450,000 to have his son admitted to USC as a purported basketball recruit, will plead guilty to a count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, according to the memo.
According to a statement from USC, Janke left the University when a new coaching staff took over for the women’s soccer team. The U.S. Attorney’s office said she has agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation and will testify in trial if needed.
MacFarlane is among 13 USC parents indicted in the scheme — the most of any University named in the FBI affidavit. So far, 13 parents from eight universities, including USC, UCLA, Stanford and Yale, have pleaded guilty to the charges. USC parents Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli, who paid $500,000 to create false athletic profiles to have their two daughters admitted to the University, filed a not guilty plea April 15.
Janke helped create fake athlete recruiting profiles for some of the students who were admitted to USC through the scheme, including MacFarlane’s son. MacFarlane’s daughter was admitted to the University as a soccer recruit and graduated in 2018 without playing soccer. 
The Edge College & Career Network, a for-profit college counseling business founded by businessman William “Rick” Singer, is accused of running the student-athlete recruitment scam.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote that Singer emailed MacFarlane’s daughter’s high school transcript and college exam scores to Janke in October 2013 and soon after, The Edge College & Career Network wire transferred $50,000 and $100,000 on two separate occasions to a private soccer club controlled by Janke and another defendant named in the charges.
In 2016, Singer sent $50,000 to USC Athletics and in 2017, MacFarlane paid $200,000 to The Edge College & Career Network.
According to the memo, Janke and MacFarlane will each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of at least $250,000. 
Janke’s lawyer declined to comment. MacFarlane’s lawyer did not respond in time for publication.

The Undergraduate Student Government voted unanimously in a meeting Tuesday to pass a resolution to support California Assembly Bill 1510, which would allow victims of former campus doctors George Tyndall and Dennis Kelly who have passed their statute of limitations to present their cases. 
USC hired a San Francisco-based lobbying firm March 1 to oppose the legislation, which would grant lawyers a one-year window to revive cases that are time-barred by California’s statute of limitations, specifically for cases that occurred at a university health center.
For the first time this semester, USG presented and voted on a resolution in the same USG meeting. To pass the bill before the end of the semester, the Senate unanimously voted to halt parliamentary procedures to accelerate the voting process.
During the meeting, former Sen. Matthew Crane advocated for the Senate to move the resolution from “New Business” to “Old Business” in the meeting agenda, which allowed for the resolution to be voted upon the same day.
“If our own student body can’t vote in support of the sexual assault victims of our student health center, then what are we doing here as a student government?” Crane said. 
Crane co-authored the resolution with Sen. Haley Garland, Sen. Angela Chuang and former Sen. Michaela Murphy. Crane said it was essential for USG to pass the resolution to hold USC accountable for past administration’ actions and push for change from current leaders. 
“If we don’t say something against it, then [the administration] will get away with it,” Crane said. “We can’t do anything about what happened with the last administration. They kicked everyone out. They cleaned house. These people are still here.”
Murphy said it was critical for USG to pass this resolution to show support for victims of Tyndall and Kelly.
