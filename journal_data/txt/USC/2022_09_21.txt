The 50th Anniversary celebration of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism was held at Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday, and included speeches from Dean Willow Bay,  President Carol Folt and Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of the Annenberg Foundation Wallis Annenberg. A number of students and guest speakers also joined them. 
“Plenty of people thought the idea of a school for communication was a little bit silly,” Annenberg said while reminiscing during her speech.
Founded in 1971 with the support of the late University Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg, the school aimed to provide students with the tools to lead the world into a new age of media. 
Under the guidance of former dean Geoffery Cowan, the school officially integrated journalism in 1994. Ernest J. Wilson III served as dean from 2007 until 2017, during which he digitized the program for the modern age and helped open Annenberg Hall. Then, for the 2009 school year, the USC Board of Trustees voted to change the school’s name from the USC Annenberg School for Communication to the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Annenberg spoke about her philanthropy efforts and how communication and the spread of information has become more important than ever before since the school’s inception in the 1970s.
“If we don’t learn to harness [communication] and change it to our greatest ideals, our world could spin out of control,” she said.
Annenberg concluded her speech by underlining the school’s goals going forward. 
“Around the world, our most fundamental institutions — democracy, human rights and a free press — are under siege,” she said. “The way we fight back is by training and sustaining the next generation of leaders, journalists, and communicators. We’re not just teaching communication at this school. We’re teaching freedom itself.”
After her speech, Annenberg presented Dean Bay and former deans Wilson III and Cowan with a gift of $250,000 for their understanding of “what this school could be, and help[ing] it to change with the changing times.” Guests then made their way to an outdoor dinner. 
A number of students from various years and programs also spoke at the event. Ho-Chun Herbert Chang, a Ph.D. candidate in communications, discussed his research on generating algorithms that can better facilitate online conversations to preserve the integrity of social media.
“As social media grows more advanced, branching into virtual reality with AI bots, I believe it’s research like mine that will have an impact on decades to come to proactively design social media to preserve the truth,” Chang said.
He later elaborated on Annenberg’s future role in these changes.
“Annenberg is very-well positioned to lead the efforts that combine both research and algorithms and users to discuss things about social media,” he said.
Mariela Gomez, a first-generation master’s student in journalism, was born in Salinas, California to a family of farm workers. Growing up, she said, the news she watched did not reflect her community. 
“Crime news dominated the airways, failing to convey the resiliency, strength and thriving of my family and community,” Gomez said.
It was this experience that inspired her to go into journalism, wanting to bring more diversity to the field and broaden the scope in which stories are told. 
“I hope to see [Annenberg] continue singling out students with diverse experiences, races, class, gender, all of that,” Gomez said.
Mike Huckman, a guest speaker and Annenberg alumnus — who since graduating in 1983 has worked in broadcast journalism for nearly two decades — said the caliber of the program at Annenberg and its students impressed him. 
“I think it’s places like USC Annenberg where the future of communication, of journalism, of digital, of all these things is going to be reimagined over and over and over again,” Huckman said.
Folt echoed a message of continued dedication towards truth and transparency throughout the night during her speech and with the student press. 
“If we ever needed people to stand up to misinformation and disinformation, people to fight for truth, this is that moment, and we can’t lose sight of the importance of discovery in getting that right,” Folt said. “This school was built for that.”

Russia began its invasion of Ukraine 207 days ago. Since then, the invasion has become a protracted conflict, with Russia sustaining heavy losses but occupying swaths of Ukrainian territory in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. 
This dynamic has changed in the past couple of weeks with Ukraine’s military reclaiming territory and causing thousands of Russian troops to retreat after launching a counteroffensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. In just one week, Ukraine has gained more territory from Russia than Russia had been able to during six months of the invasion.  
Given the sheer amount of information coming from the war, as well as the tendency of both sides to present information in the best light possible, it can be difficult to figure out what exactly is going on in Ukraine at any point in time, said Robert English, director of the USC School of International Relations and an expert in East European politics.
“It can be difficult to get at the objective truth when everyone’s spinning,” English said. “But the only way to overcome that is to just have more and more sources of information to compare and contrast and over time you will learn what you should discount or what you should recognize as hyperbole or exaggeration. And, therefore, you’re able to put things in a better context than maybe six months or four months ago. It’s an art, learning to sift through and adjust for all the distortions or omissions.”
Professor English also said he believes there are realistic endgames for both Russia and Ukraine. 
“For Ukraine, it’s expelling Russia and getting back all or most of its occupied territory,” English said. “For Russia, it’s holding onto that territory. It’s not realistic that Russia could launch new offensives and push all the way to Odessa or resume attacks on Kyiv. That’s not going to happen.”
Back in February, the Daily Trojan spoke with Alex Chouliak, a Ukrainian student and junior majoring in business administration. In a recent interview, she said she has remained optimistic since the beginning of the invasion and is pleased with the support she received from her peers and professors within the USC community. 
“I’m glad that the professors are really understanding,” Chouliak said. “Last semester, especially, I had a few professors who really made sure that I knew that they were there for me, so I don’t have any issues with professors. I’m also thankful that I have a lot of friends at USC who understand my situation.”
Maksim Franko, a senior majoring in economics and mathematics, wrote a letter to the editor to the Daily Trojan urging the USC community, and the United States as a whole, to rally behind Ukraine and provide support. Franko also expressed optimism about Ukraine’s ability to successfully fight Russia. Six months later, he said he is pleased with the military aid that the U.S. has provided Ukraine, though he maintains Ukraine still needs continued U.S. support to be successful. 
“I think the U.S. has done a lot to help my country win this war, with billions and billions of dollars for military aid,” Franko said. “Without that, I don’t know if we would still be here, because that is a very substantial amount of help. I do think it’s a lot, but it’s not enough. I would still urge people to talk about this and urge their governments to do more.”
Both Chouliak and Franko, however, said they were let down by the University’s response. 
“With the administration, I don’t remember the last time I’ve been so disappointed in anything,” Chouliak said. “It’s been slightly over six months, and the only response I’ve gotten so far is them saying that, at the moment, we can’t do anything for you. I mean, the only thing that they’ve offered is mental health services. But, when you’re not sure if you can pay for tuition next semester, that’s not necessarily what’s on your mind.”
Though they can’t predict the war’s end, both Franko and Chouliak look forward to the possibility. 
“We all want it to end, so, hopefully, it really is happening,” Franko said.

The Undergraduate Student Government introduced a senate resolution in support of Armenian students at Tuesday’s senate meeting. On Tuesday, Sept. 13, Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked and unjustified invasion on sovereign, internationally recognized territory within the Republic of Armenia, resulting in 7,600 civilians being displaced from their homes and 207 Armenian servicemen and civilians killed. 
USG stands in solidarity with the Armenian student community and called for the Office of the Provost and President Carol Folt to release a statement to all deans and professors speaking on the state of affairs of Armenia, advocating for professors to provide support and accommodations.
“We have students on campus this past week [who] have tried to balance school and work, and this incident is very bad for their mental health,” said Eduard Ghazaryan, philanthropy chair of the Armenian Students Association. “We’re trying to get recognition [from the University] for students after a week of silence on this matter.”
Prior to this, president Hannah Woodworth presented status updates on her projects; the USC-Los Angeles Airport shuttle reservation requests have been submitted and are set for use for fall break. USG is currently finalizing the reservation portal. The number of shuttles will account for the responses on the reservation portal.
USG is also in the process of conducting qualitative interviews to determine how to best connect student organizations with its resources, meeting with eight out of twenty-five student leaders so far. They are also working to establish a new crisis response guide for what to do in the case of campus-wide emergencies. 
Executive councils will begin meeting in October. The councils — Social Impact Council, Fraternity and Sorority Life Council, Athletics and Recreation Life Council, Religious and Spiritual Life Council, Residential and First-Year council and ROTC and Veterans Council — bring student leaders together to discuss issues in their communities. A seventh council, the Academic Council, including representatives from each of the schools, will be established at a time “coming soon.” 
Amid rising heat waves, Woodworth has been in discussion with President Carol Folt about residential housing facilities that lack air conditioning systems. 
“For first-year students who are in residential housing and do not have access to air conditioning,” Woodworth said. “You’re not even allowed to bring your own personal air conditioner into your room. The issues are just going to escalate to be worse and worse with the current infrastructure on campus… we’re brainstorming ways that for the next few years we can better support students during these heat waves.”
Vice president Nivea Krishnan shared her personal leadership style, describing her guiding philosophy as transparency, equity and accuracy. 
“I want to make sure [my leadership style] is known because I think it’s very easy when you’re in high-level decision-making to lose that sort of personal connection,” Krishnan said. “I want to be transparent and make sure all students know where I stand, prioritize organizational access for underrepresented groups and create a culture of objective information sharing.”
Krishnan also presented updates about her projects, including prospective workshops with the Gould School of Law for students to learn about their rights as students. Currently, the project pitch has been drafted, and USG will be meeting with representatives from Gould on Thursday. Student Basic Needs is also hoping to open a new location for Trojan Pantry this semester in King’s Hall. 
Funding director Jake Stemmons presented the department’s goals to increase accessibility to funding by providing guidelines and office hours to answer any questions, as well as ensuring efficient turnover for funding applications and transparency in the funding process. 
The department held its first funding workshop last Wednesday. The workshop created a more personal space for registered student organizations and their members to ask questions regarding their funding. 
“We try to take a very holistic approach as long as [RSOs] follow the funding guidelines,” Stemmons said. “ We don’t want to insert our own personal opinions or knowledge on this decision; if an RSO wants to run an event that follows the guidelines, it’s not really our place to say no to that.”
Chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias shared that the advocacy department is preparing for Sex Week which will be Oct. 17 to Oct. 23, a week dedicated to sex exploration and promoting healthy sexuality. USG RSVP liaisons Alexia Sambrano and Alyssa Alegre are available as points of contact for RSOs to help facilitate RSVP workshops within the organization. 
Senator Sanjana Sambhwani shared her goals of trying to bridge the gap between USG and the student body, including having post-senate-meeting dinners, tabling on Trousdale Parkway and meeting with RSOs. 
Her projects for the semester include establishing a 24-hour/extended hours dining option, having a dedicated space on campus for commuter students and preparing for national transfer student week to provide transfer students an opportunity to get resources and meet other students.
The Senate unanimously confirmed the appointment of director of public relations Mustafa Ali Khan, a junior studying business administration, chair of the elections commission Omar Habhab, a senior studying political science, and elections commissioner Ethan Situ, a freshman studying economics, politics and philosophy. 
Senator Yoav Gillath asked Habhab about what he saw as the problem of the election process and what changes he hopes to make during the next election cycle. 
“The main issue I saw was transparency in how to access voting,” Habhab said. “There are a lot of students who do not know how to access voting and do not know how to vote … one of my main goals is increasing voter engagement and voter turnout.”

Members of VoteSC and the USC Center for the Political Future celebrated National Voter Registration Day across campus Tuesday, offering students free ice cream in exchange for their pledge to register to vote by scanning a QR code.
Natasha Tieu, a junior double majoring in history and economics and data science and president of VoteSC, hoped to bolster USC voter turnout in light of the approaching November midterm elections by setting up a table in front of Tommy Trojan with a sign reading, “Pledge 2 Vote, Free Ice Cream.”
“We’re at a critical point for our generation where a lot of us are coming into the age that we’re allowed to vote, and we are pretty civically passionate,” said Tieu. “A lot of us take to social media to express our opinions, whatever they may be. But a lot of us don’t actually take those opinions to the ballot box.”
After five years of campaigning for increased voter registration, VoteSC was honored this year by the federal government for being one of the most civically engaged campuses in the country.
“A bunch of college campuses have a competition to see how many students they can register to vote, and we always come in first place,” said Tieu. “We’re hoping to be first place again this year, and I think we’re on track to do so.”
President Carol Folt also arrived at the stand to speak with volunteers about their passion for civic participation.
“Voting is probably one of your most important responsibilities as a member of a democracy,” Folt told the Daily Trojan. “And if you believe in it, which I think we all do, we should be a part of protecting it.”
The results of the 2020 Presidential election inspired Aishat Tiamiyu, a sophomore majoring in public policy, to volunteer for VoteSC to ensure USC students’ voices are heard. Through her internship at California Common Cause, she hopes to increase civic engagement.
“I feel empowered,” Tiamiyu said. “Anytime a person scans a QR code, we say we’re saving democracy one person at a time.”
The USC voter registration rate for undergraduate students in 2018 was just over 75%, but members of VoteSC say there is still room for improvement in voter turnout.
“College is a really unique place because it encourages students to think for themselves without the pressure or consequences of the real world,” said Helen Sohn, co-director of external affairs and a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “So I think right now is an important time to get started and learn more about what’s going on with our government.”
Sohn intends to encourage students who wouldn’t normally have an interest in the political world to register.
“I feel like people in STEM [majors] typically aren’t interested in voting,” Sohn said. “I know that [in] the political scene, there’s a lot of heated debate. A lot of things trigger anxiety in people, but I want to destigmatize talking about politics.”
Alex Flores, a freshman majoring in public relations, said the stand is especially important following the historical and contemporary voter suppression in the United States and across the world.
“I am from a third-world country, El Salvador,” Flores said. “A lot of people over there do not have the right to vote. So when I got my U.S. citizenship, I always told myself I would vote every year because I have the right to do it.”
VoteSC is planning other civic education events as the midterm elections approach.
“We’re actually going to be hosting a series of info sessions for all USC students, where they can come and learn about issues on the ballot for this upcoming November,” Tieu said. “It will be nonpartisan—we’re just getting people facts.”
Jillian Fallon, a senior majoring in political science and public relations and chief programming officer at USG, volunteered at a registration stand in the USC Village.
“We’re unifying behind one voice, whether that be through a politician, through the president, or through USC,” Fallon said. “There are a million voices that contribute to those conversations…even though your voice seems small, every voice matters.”

Bing Theatre bustled School of Dramatic Arts students Saturday as they awaited the arrival of Mindy Kaling, creator and writer of Netflix’s “Never Have I Ever” television show. Kaling made an appearance as part of the kickoff for a 10-week intensive Multihyphenate Masterclass series, where she received the inaugural Multihyphenate Award, which recognizes artists who have taken on multiple roles within the entertainment industry and made the field more inclusive. The Masterclass event series invites USC students to learn about storytelling and supports them on their own creative journeys.
At Saturday’s event, Kaling was joined with other multihyphenated artists serving as guest panelists. Producer, entrepreneur and cultural commentator Franklin Leonard, artistic director, actor and theater-maker Sean San José, and film and television producer and executive Paula Wagner discussed how they contribute to storytelling efforts for inclusivity, what it is like being a multihyphenated artist and how they became multihyphenates. 
“Multihyphenates are unique because they create their own opportunities and diversify the stories we experience in entertainment. I thought a panel would demystify the process of becoming a multihyphenated artist for our students so that it seems like something achievable for them – because it is achievable for them!” SDA Dean Emily Roxworthy wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
Emmy Award winner and USC faculty member Colman Domingo led the panel and kicked off the event by describing his journey as a multihyphenate. He explained how his initial desire to pursue photography changed after taking an acting class in college — leading him to explore different roles within the entertainment industry. 
“I learned that progress for most artists is not linear and to definitely expect that for my career when I enter the entertainment industry, … [since] being a multihyphenate artist is all about trying new things,” said Maya Reddy, a freshman majoring in theater  who attended the event. “Everybody has that end goal in mind and wants to get there the fastest way possible, but it doesn’t always happen that way. Sometimes, the end goal changes, … but it’s inspiring to know that you can take the non-traditional route and still end up in a place of incredible success, just like Paula Wagner and Colman Domingo and all of these artists.” 
The program’s sessions were designed to help train students at the highest level and prepare them for careers in the arts and entertainment industry. Roxworthy said that some of the most successful young artists, including SDA alumni like Gabriela Ortega, who works for Disney, and James Morosini, who created his own feature film, are multihyphenates. 
“By diversifying their creativity and creating their own content, SDA students can create their own opportunities, so they’re not waiting by the phone for that big break to come calling,” Roxworthy wrote. “I’d say the number one goal of the program is to expose SDA students to the different skill sets they can take on, so they don’t have to wait by the phone ever again.” 
Students learned how to become multihyphenated artists and were exposed to different opportunities in the entertainment industry.
“I found the content and what I learned pretty inspiring because everybody who spoke came from a different background, … [yet] they have all been met with a lot of success,” Katie Klaskin, a sophomore majoring in theater, said. “[It was cool to know that] I don’t have to only do one thing within the industry for the rest of my life. I can explore my different interests.”
Many guest panelists, including Kaling, discussed representation in the entertainment industry and what it is like to be a minority in the field. When Kaling worked for NBC sitcom “The Office,” she was the only female writer on the show and had to adjust to the environment. Still, she wrote more episodes than her male counterparts over the show’s nine-season run. 
“She’s genuinely my idol,” Reddy said. “I feel very lucky as a woman of color, as a brown woman, to be entering into an industry in her wake because I didn’t see myself represented when I was growing up, but now, because of her work, I do, and I’m happy to be coming into an industry where I feel like she’s made a space for people who look like me.” 
In the coming weeks, students can look forward to hearing from artists like Rodric David, the founder of Thunder Studios, and Sibyl Wickersheimer, an associate professor of scenic design, who will also be featured in the Masterclass series. 
“I felt really fortunate that USC provided SDA students with this opportunity because there’s really no other school that has such great access to these people,” Klaskin said. “I think it was really great for us to be able to listen and learn from them and take what they say and try to apply it in some way to our own lives.”

I’m not going to start off this piece describing a heartfelt anecdote about me coming from a low-income, Mexican immigrant family, who persevered and made it to college. Why you ask? Narratives that focus on youthful and scholarly resilience dominate news headlines, which in turn erases the real, ongoing struggles that older undocumented immigrants face in the United States. 
In 2010, the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors or DREAM Act was passed in the United States House of Representatives but blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. The act sought to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented minors upon a clean background check, earning or working to obtain a college degree and having entered the U.S. before the age of 18. Regardless, the term “Dreamer” arose from legislative speech, which applied to anyone who would have qualified for the DREAM Act. Being a Dreamer became a movement, propelling youth to dream about a future in the U.S., educated and all. 
Following the failure of the DREAM Act, former President Barack Obama announced a band-aid solution to the ethical dilemma that concerned many in 2012 — the deportation of undocumented youth who lacked agency in the decision to immigrate to the U.S. at a young age. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program functions similarly to the DREAM Act, apart from one crucial measure: DACA lacks any clear path for citizenship. 
So, how has this shaped the 2010s? Although DACA was meant to be a temporary solution, it was still ground-breaking legislation. It allowed for undocumented youth to temporarily work, attend school and even get a driver’s license. But with such a legislative program, came an overload of the DACA success narrative. 
Every night my parents would watch the news, all sorts of outlets in Spanish. On air, they’d see a young person named Isidro or Lourdes or Joel or Citlali graduate from high school and attend a prestigious university with the intent of becoming a politician or an immigration lawyer or a political activist. All thanks to DACA, my parents know about Harvard. 
Considering there are more than 600,000 DACA recipients this year alone, DACA success stories are everywhere. Though, it’s not anyone’s fault for their success. Naturally, we crave a good story and often that means spotlighting the underdogs. The U.S. is built on broader narratives like these, which follow the beats of the once-loved, now rancid American Dream. News broadcasts, magazines and viral Twitter posts feed us any underrepresented success story and we eat it up. They give us these glimpses of hope, and by happenstance, we forget real issues that rot the wellbeing of many — the issues the older generation of undocumented immigrants endure. 
California farmworkers produce an astounding amount of agricultural capital, producing about one third of the U.S. vegetables. And working these fields are around 600,000 undocumented immigrants, about 75% of total farmworkers. They’re here and working without benefits or any security, and at the same time, facing environmental discrimination via rising rates of pesticide poisoning. According to a California Department of Pesticide Regulation, the number of pesticide poisoning cases in farmworkers disproportionately make up overall cases.
This is only one issue in a country ranging widely in biomes and population demographics and political climate. And as we dip between state lines and confront different issues — the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, hurricane conditions in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and the raging temperatures in the South West —  we can approach each issue understanding how undocumented immigrants experience it differently — often worse off. 
The lived experiences of this older undocumented generation often do not get to tell their stories. Nor do they seek help due to fear of deportation at any governmental interaction. Advocacy on behalf of this generation is minimal, and while DACA opened many doors for immigrants, it has also shut the door even tighter for older immigrants.
In 2015, Barack Obama intended to create a program similar to DACA in order to help the parents of childhood arrivals called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans or DAPA. DAPA would have provided the same benefits as DACA but was quickly challenged and stopped by the Supreme Court. Today, this potential program remains unknown and DAPA is known simply as a typo for DACA. 
DACA stories quell our concern for other discriminatory issues older undocumented immigrants face, and we fall into this continuous loop of the American Dream evolving and lying to our faces. While “dreamers” are allowed to dream, we must not forget those who aren’t granted such luxury and must continue advocating for them.

The dawn of 2021 marked the first time I ever disabled the notifications on my Apple News app. I dreaded coming across another depressing headline. It seemed like my newsfeed was inundated daily with terrifying pandemic statistics and tragic climate crises. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. The world was on fire, so I shut my eyes and held my breath. 
It’s easy to fall into the trap of believing that we need to update ourselves on the latest news stories night and day. Constantly reading the news is what keeps us informed, balanced and connected. Neglecting to do so would only make us feel guilt and ignorance. Right?
Wrong. Some psychologists have begun fighting back against the notion that individuals will feel worse if they maintain some distance from the endless news cycle. Because at the end of the day, no one should sacrifice their mental health to stay informed. In fact, limiting your news consumption can be an important act of self-care.
News stories are overwhelmingly negative and can provoke stress reactions from readers. Absorbing repetitively negative news day in and day out caused me nothing but sadness, anger, outrage and helplessness. After all, how much can we really influence the outcomes of most news stories we read?
Asking this question can help us start setting healthy boundaries. If you find that you can positively contribute to a cause an article draws awareness to, you should! If it’s something completely outside of your control, that’s okay too. The key is to evaluate your feelings regularly. If a story does nothing but make you feel helpless and brings your mood down, take a step back from the news. If a story offers an opportunity to help that’s within your means, take it and focus on the positive effect you were able to have.
For those of us who are less in tune with our emotions, setting time limits can help too. Maybe set aside a cumulative 20 minutes a day that you’ll dedicate toward the news. Constant proximity to negativity can have serious mental and emotional repercussions. Setting time boundaries enables you to find a balance between cutting yourself off completely and succumbing to the 24-hour news cycle.
And, here’s another thing to consider — despite the daily dose of turmoil, positive newsworthy events are happening every day. We often fall victim to negativity bias and focus more of our attention on the grim news stories. 
Psychologist Austin Perlmutter explains, “Due to the negativity bias, we preferentially consume negative content. We look for negative media, and news organizations — in a desire to maintain attention and viewership — emphasize negative stories.” 
When negative news seems to be all that is available to us, we tend to overestimate how often they occur. Perlmutter uses robberies as an example: when you find that your neighbor across the street was robbed, you might think that home invasions are a major issue and worry that you could be next. However, in reality, they’re relatively uncommon. 
What reinforces this even more is confirmation bias, a term in psychology that describes the tendency to find evidence that supports our beliefs rather than information that disproves it. The world occasionally does seem like it is on fire and only worse and worse things occur in society, but through conscious effort, it should be possible to seek out positive news stories too. And to prove it, I scoured the Internet for a story that just might lift your spirits.
The first positive news story that caught my eye couldn’t have been cuter. “Pups at the Park” at Dodger Stadium proved an absolute success this month, with hundreds of pet owners parading the field alongside their beloved dogs. The Labor Day festivities featured hundreds of dogs of all sizes, shapes and breeds for a night of contests and fun. 
Local pet celebrity Macho led the puppy parade. Macho, an adorable Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest dog to round the bases at a Major League Stadium.  
The dog costume contest was the standout of the night. If you’re ever feeling down, simply Google “Dodgers Pups at the Park Costume Contest.” You’ll be greeted with the smiling faces of countless dogs sporting Dodgers jerseys, bandanas, caps and more. Some contestants even dyed their dogs’ fur blue. 
We all need to learn how to take time for a moment of happiness. The stories we are fed don’t accurately reflect the state of the world in its entirety. It’s not always an easy endeavor, but striving for balance in your news consumption can do wonders for your mood. The positive stories are out there, in print and in real life.

Coach Jebreh Harris was quick to stress that the cross country team was not running at full strength in Saturday’s showing at the UC Riverside Invitational, where it finished at a lukewarm 27th out of 31 teams.
A handful of top runners didn’t race because of illness, and Harris has more broadly employed a strategy of “training through” the first couple regular season meets before the Pac-12 championship next month. 
Generally, “training through” a meet means that runners won’t taper their training in order to hit peak performance at that regular season meet — which could decrease the overall quality of training in the long run — and instead focus solely on building fitness and only tapering for post-season competition. 
A sport like cross country, where all conference teams are guaranteed a spot at the Pac-12 championship, tends to reward that training mentality.
The gun went off early on the chilly overcast morning, though the 6k course’s fast-narrowing start led to a tussle and fall toward the back of the 260-runner pack some 50 meters in — prompting the starter to recall the race. A frustrated backtrack and second gun later, the race was on in earnest.
Senior Janiah Brown was the first Trojan at the 2k mark in 106th place, quickly followed by senior Mihajla Milovanovic and freshman Lucy Westlake in what, at that point, was still a fairly large pack of runners. But the race strung out by the 4k split, and Westlake now led the Trojans in 116th place, followed by Brown in 127th and Milovanovic in 147th. 
Westlake would then go on to gain another 11 places, crossing the finish line in 105th place with a 22:02 final 6k time. Brown (123rd), Milovanovic (153rd), sophomore Vienna Gao (184th) and freshman Liyat Kebbede (199th) posted the rest of the squad’s scoring places. 
“First three women, I wanted them to go out and attack the first mile,” Harris said. “They executed the race the way we wanted them to.”
Saturday was the first career 6k race for Westlake, Kebbede, Gao and redshirt freshman Jacqueline Duarte — and the first ever USC race for the latter two.
“I’m proud of two of the young ladies’ first time putting the shield on, [stepping up] for some teammates who are not here today,” Harris said, referencing the shield emblem that adorns USC’s track and cross country uniforms.
Luckily for the Trojans, the Pac-12 championship on Oct. 28 will be on the same course as Saturday’s race, giving the team a preview of what that first postseason race might look like. The squad is scheduled to run again in mid-October at the Bronco Invitational in Sunnyvale, California, but for now, all eyes are on the Pac-12 meet.
“We’re in the heat of some deep training right now,” Harris said. “We’re gonna be alright.”

In May of this year, I lost my Hydro Flask water bottle. I spent my days at home hoping that I had left it in my apartment in Los Angeles, but when I got back in August, it was still missing.  
While I was Flaskless, I bought my fair share of aluminum water bottles from Seeds or Starbucks. Each time I grimaced at the fact that I was paying for water, something that I can obtain for free. But I suppose it is the container, not the water, that has real value. 
I would reuse it throughout the day, perhaps extending its usage for another day or two in an effort to avoid purchasing the most essential liquid in sustaining human life. But inevitably, the bottle would become burdensome at some point, and I would toss the skinny metal Smart Water bottle into the recycling. 
Luckily, a few weeks into this semester, I found it tucked away in a cabinet beneath my kitchen sink. I washed it a few times and added it back to the category of things I bring to campus every day, and no longer needed to waste money at Seeds — at least not on water.  
At the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, especially on days as hot as the home opener against Rice, bottled water is in high demand. Something about the combination of drinking beer and standing in the sun makes people crave H2O. Because generally you can’t bring a reusable water bottle into the stadium, there are plastic and aluminum bottles aplenty on game day. 
In April 2022, the University announced that they would end the sale of single-use plastics on campus and in the Coliseum in an effort to be more environmentally conscious — cue the aluminum water bottles that have sprung up almost everywhere on campus. 
“We know that plastics are harmful to the environment, to wildlife and to marine life. And by switching to eco-friendly beverage containers, we’re making a huge difference in protecting the planet, alongside our corporate partners,” President Carol Folt said in a statement announcing the decision. 
There is no doubt that this was a step in the right direction for a more sustainable campus. Mounds of discarded plastic have been found all over the planet’s oceans, and by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Plastic bottles account for 14 percent of all litter — not just plastic. The raw materials in a plastic water bottle are obtained by fracking, an oil extraction method that accounts for three percent of the amount of methane gas released each year. 
Even though some plastics are recyclable, only five to six percent of plastic used in the U.S. in 2021 was actually recycled, according to a study performed by environmental groups Beyond Plastics and The Last Beach Cleanup. That’s a three percent decrease from 2018, even as more people have become aware of the importance of sustainability. 
Using aluminum as a water container is a better alternative to plastic bottles, but it costs about 25% to 30%  percent more to produce than plastic. 
So good on USC for switching it up and perhaps spending a bit more in order to provide more sustainable options for people like me who have lost their water bottles. However, how much better is aluminum? 
Aluminum cans or bottles are infinitely recyclable, resulting in 65% of aluminum being recycled in America, compared to plastic’s abysmal five percent. However, the production of an aluminum can release twice the amount of carbon dioxide into the air as the production of a plastic bottle, as it requires using high amounts of electricity and releases perfluorocarbons, which are 9,200 times more harmful than carbon dioxide. So, while using aluminum (or aluminium for my friends from across the pond) is certainly better than plastics, it’s still not ideal. 
Bottled water is a $19 billion industry — it’s not going away. But, with giant budgets for marketing and advertising, surely some of these drink corporations could afford to explore other options. 
Boxed water might be one. The process by which boxed water is made produces half the amount of carbon as aluminum. The boxes used in the process are recyclable, but it certainly isn’t infinite like the recyclability of aluminum. The boxes are lined with aluminum and polyethylene, which are difficult to separate from the paper cartons. Many recyclers won’t bother recycling boxed water because the process doesn’t yield a product that is valuable enough to validate the expense. 
So, when it comes down to it, there really isn’t an ideal way to consume single-use water containers in a sustainable way. Corporations can and will try to find other materials that are less harmful and will certainly exaggerate the benefits of aluminum or paper containers in their marketing campaigns, but maybe the best solution is to find a reusable water bottle or Hydro Flask  and try not to lose it.
