“News, your photos are up! Tease is also done!”
Our job is seemingly rote. We come into the office at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. every Monday night through Thursday and at 12 p.m. every Sunday afternoon.
We sit down at our workstation, open Google Chrome and an ugly array of tabs (Google Mail, Google Drive, Trello, multiple Google spreadsheets with assignments, the USC Trojan Athletics website, and Instagram) and connect to the work server that all sections access to drop and lay out their pages.
An inconspicuous, shameless plug.
As the other sections get to work copy editing and planning their pages for text and graphics space, we begin to dig through a network of folders, scouring for photos requested by Lifestyle, News and Sports (in that order). Each photographer has their own folder, and within which are even more folders created for each event or story they are assigned. Files are downloaded in a flurry and after some communication with section editors, they get adjusted for print or converted to black and white if need be. Should a section need a cutout of an image for use in a feature or next to the masthead, we take care of that as well.
And we do that every production period.
Photoshop is bae.

“Go home.”
Any other person might think this to be some sort of tension between the photo editors, as though we want to see less of the other. But it’s quite the opposite reality, just a bit of camaraderie and an environment of inside jokes that make us all the more… human.
When a bout of sickness hit most students across USC, I was among the first to become tiredly sick and Ken followed quickly thereafter (and the rest of the newsroom in suit), so it became a running joke for us to tell each other to go home rather than work until as late as midnight. Even though we’re better now, we constantly tell each other to go home in cryptic ways, mostly as a token of appreciation for the hard work and effort we each contribute.
——————
Home is where the mound of papers is.
Our home, a.k.a. our newly claimed desk, has also been a recent addition to keep things interesting. Early in the semester, the Graphics desk took over a workstation I had known to be the Photo desk since I joined the Daily Trojan in August 2012 –– though in their defense, the computer there had always been labeled “Graphics Computer” and the desks with computers labeled “Photo Computer” had always been used by copy editors in a more remote portion of the newsroom.
Instead of moving to that corner, we took over a different desk that had been home to towers of paper trays filled with rarely used office supplies and a mountain of AP Style manuals and Adobe InDesign tutorials. We worked with this sore sight for a few weeks before I decided on a whim to convert our new home:
Home, sweet home.
Ken always sits on the left, and I sit on the right. In front of Ken rests a rather bare corkboard — we only have a California College Media Award for photography from 2005 and a newly drafted checklist. Between us rests some paper trays we adopted to store random papers we are given, and a sign that reads “Daily Trojan New! Photo Desk (Because Graphics kicked us out of our old one).” In front of me rests an accumulation of this semester’s newspapers for us to reference and a self-made “What People Think I Do” poster poking fun at our jobs.
It’s not much, but it breathes a bit more life into the mundane.
But even then, our life isn’t all that mundane. I applaud Anshu Siripurapu, our editor in chief, and Sebastian Vega, our digital managing editor, for emphasizing multimedia this semester. Our Instagram account has boomed thanks to some graphics created by digital team, but mostly, as I like to tell myself, because we’ve been posting images printed in that day’s paper featuring some article or piece of work. Photo stories are becoming bigger as we try to reimagine how the  Daily Trojan looks online.
On top of all this, there is something about Daily Trojan photo editors and staff photographers which makes this job the least mundane in the world.
The typical camera bag for your local, insane, photographer.
We come from a line of photo editors for whom journalism or writing aren’t necessarily the future of our careers. The first Daily Trojan photo editor I served under, Razan Al Marzouqi, was a communications major in the Annenberg School of Journalism. But before Razan, photo editor Ani Kolangian studied gerontology. And then, after Razan, Austin Vogel studied computer science, as did the editor succeeding him, Ralf Cheung (who would actually go on to serve three terms as he continued at USC for his Master’s of Science in Computer Science). After him came Maya Dondonyan, a transfer student from the Fashion Institute of Design Merchandise who started at USC studying Philosophy. 
And now there’s Ken and I. 
Ken spent his first year of college at the University of Hawaii at Manoa before coming to USC to study economics. I started at USC as a broadcast and digital journalism major before quickly switching to mechanical engineering right before settling on computer science. The pattern of diverse academic backgrounds holds true when it comes to our photo staff, with no school or area of study more represented than another. 
As photographers, we see the Daily Trojan as an outlet for us to put our skills to use, whether that’s through telling stories or informing the world visually. It’s how we express what we see creatively and factually. It’s how we get our fix of adrenaline by covering the heat of a game or the pressure of a breaking emergency. It’s how we share how we see the world, behind the desk or not.

The college experience is truly a unique one, especially when expressed through music. Whether it’s getting pumped up for a party, commiserating about a bad breakup or midterm, or just living the life of the young and invincible, music is an integral part of our everyday experience here in college. 
There happens to be a lot of messages related to collegiate life in many of our favorite song lyrics as well. Here are some “college experience” lyrics that many will find relatable. 
The title makes it a bit obvious but this song talks about all the romantic parts about college life. “You’re walking across campus / Cruel professor / studying romances” is just one of the lyrically poetic descriptions that accurately represent the college life. 
Of course one of our favorite rappers has to be on this list. Many of Kanye’s songs represent the ultimate party life (and are perfect for party/tailgate playlists), but this song is the perfect shoutout to college life. He makes a reference to several greek houses — “Alpha, step / Omega, step / Kappa, step / Sigma, step” is how he starts off this iconic college song. It takes it a step further by expanding on West’s choice of career in the music industry based on his experience at college — “Told ‘em I finished school and I started my own business/ They say, ‘Oh you graduated?’ / No, I decided I was finished.”
Honestly, for a lot of people, college is truly the time where you find yourself. Though this song isn’t directly related to the college experience. Lines like “Say what you wanna say / and let the words fall out / honestly I wanna see you be brave” express how as young adults, we’re at a critical point in learning who we are and are coming into our own. We are learning to stand up for ourselves, and learning to be brave. 
This is your classic, young and nostalgic song about lasting friendship. The line, “And all the walls that lead you there were winding / and all the lights that lead you there are blinding,” reminds us of the uncertainty of a  future that seems so far and yet so close, which is perfectly relatable to college seniors on the brink of entering the real world. 
Though often used as a party song, the lyrics in this one represent that struggle all of us college kids can relate to. We are all free in a way we have never really experienced before, and are learning what really matters. “I’m in the pursuit of happiness and I know / everything that shine ain’t always gonna be gold.”

The No. 7 Trojans, who beat the No. 10 UCLA Bruins in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament on Wednesday, failed to overcome the No. 2 Utah Utes in the second round Thursday night, falling 80-72 at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas. 
In the 8-point defeat, the Trojans were outshot inside and outside the 3-point line, outrebounded by a margin of 35-31 and were beaten in terms of ball distribution with Southern California earning just nine assists to Utah’s 22. 
Head coach Andy Enfield complimented the Trojans overall effort, but criticized the lack of defensive execution, especially with Utah sophomore forward Kyle Kuzma scoring a team-high 23 points and grabbing seven rebounds. 
”We didn’t play great tonight, but we played hard enough, especially in the second half to come back,” Enfield said, according to the Associated Press. ”Their players, like Kuzma, stepped up and had a big game against us and that’s what happens. You try to take something away or maybe their first or second option and if the third or fourth option beats you, then you lose.”
Pac-12 Player of the Year and potential Wooden Award candidate Jakob Poeltl was effective, scoring 14 points and helping with eight rebounds and two blocks. 
The Utes were especially keen on defense, limiting the Trojans to just 37 percent from deep and limited the previously potent freshman Bennie Boatwright and sophomore Elijah Stewart to a combined 8 points off of 3-of-16 shooting. 
As for the Trojans’ bright spots, sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin scored a game-high 24 points off of 9-of-16 shooting with two rebounds and a steal. Fellow junior guards Julian Jacobs and Katin Reinhardt added 16 and 13, respectively. 
And while the loss was hard for Jacobs, he emphasized the importance of moving on.
“It’s what our coaching staff and the entire community around this team has emphasized — keep fighting,” Jacobs told the Los Angeles Times. 
And while the defeat may have knocked the Trojans out of Pac-12 title contention, they still are in the running for the NCAA tournament. They find out whether they will earn a spot in March Madness on Sunday.
