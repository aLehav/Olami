It was revenge night Thursday for No. 15 USC as it faced a Stanford team that gave the Trojans their first loss of the season two weeks ago. 
Galen Center waited for a Trojan team to come out with vengeance in a season where it was off to its best start since 1971. Two hours later, on a night where crosstown rivals UCLA took sole possession of first place in the Pac-12, it played out like a nightmare.
USC crumbled in crunch time with only 4 field goals in the final nine minutes of the game, collapsing in a 64-61 defeat against the Cardinal. 
Down 5 points with 2:46 remaining in the game, a midrange jumper by junior forward Max Agbonkpolo, then a 3-pointer by senior guard Drew Peterson tied the game, sending fans to stand up and erupt in unison. 
Freshman forward Harrison Ingram gave Stanford the lead on the next play with 33 seconds left in the game. Junior forward Isaiah Mobley was then fouled while driving in, missing 1 of 2 free throws on the next possession with Stanford in control of the rebound.
The Cardinal hit 2 free throws, and Mobley missed the game-tying 3-pointer after a broken play, sending shockwaves throughout an arena with high hopes.
“We got a good look,” said Peterson in a postgame press conference. “I thought it was going in.” 
Peterson had a team-high 14 points along with 7 rebounds and 2 steals. Mobley had 9 points, 9 assists and 7 rebounds. Junior guard Boogie Ellis added 11 points — he hobbled off the floor with an injury at 4:48 left in the game, but returned to finish the game. 
The loss ends the Trojans’ streak of five straight home victories against Stanford. USC coughed up the ball 14 times, its seventh straight game with double-digit turnovers.
“I was disappointed [with] our upperclassmen. We left our feet a few times and made some errant passes,” Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “It was just frustrating because 14 turnovers is just a few too many … That’s on us as a team.” 
After shooting 34.6% from the field in the first half, Stanford shot a scorching 50% in the second. The Trojans also saw their percentage dip into the 30s after a hot first half. 
 For USC, the game began poorly, similar to its previous one against Arizona State. 
The Trojans came out sluggish, scoring their first point two and a half minutes into the game, while allowing a Stanford team that’s shooting 43% from the field on the season shoot 73% the first 10 minutes. 
“We missed 4 layups to start the game,” Enfield said. “It’s hard to get off to good starts when we miss 4 layups.  … We need to convert those.” 
Just like Monday night, Galen Center sat anxiously waiting for this team to show why it began the year 13-0. With seven minutes left in the first half, the Trojans came alive. 
A cutting dunk by freshman forward Kobe Johnson electrified the crowd and sparked a 17-3 USC run to close the half. The Trojans then held the Cardinal without a field goal for eight minutes.
Going into halftime down 6, Stanford came out on a 9-3 run to tie the game before USC regained the lead, only for the game to tie again with 10:42 left. The Cardinal sank into another scoring drought with no baskets for three minutes, but the Trojans didn’t capitalize, losing their lead for good with five minutes remaining. 
“There’s not a lot of games left, but there is a lot of games left,” Mobley said. “We just got to focus and fix what we need to fix and go from there.”
USC will look to bounce back against UC Berkeley at home Saturday.

In the manner of a true educator, two and a half years ago, Arieh Warshel decided he wanted to put out an instructive story. He published his book, “From Kibbutz Fishponds to The Nobel Prize: Taking Molecular Functions Into Cyberspace,” on Oct. 28 of last year.
In the book, Warshel, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry and 2013 Nobel Prize awardee for chemistry, recounts his childhood and adolescence in Israel. He grew up in a kibbutz, a way of communal life where everyone worked for everyone as part of the community. Life in the kibbutz did not emphasize learning in an academic setting, Warshel said, as there was no direct pass to a university, and children sometimes didn’t work at the same location. Warshel worked in the fish ponds.
“You’ll have to try to get the fish out and collect them … You fill the big pond much, much bigger than the USC swimming pool. You’ll fill it with very small carps, then they grow up after a year or two and then you take out the water,” Warshel said. “Then you come with [a] big net, and it’s very hard work, and [you] try to swallow the carps to big containers and then to a big tank.” 
Warshel joined the Israeli army in 1958 and, later, attended the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology for his bachelor’s degree. In 1969, he attended the Weizmann Institute of Science for his doctorate degree. Warshel said he wanted to attend university because it was rare in his community. 
“The [people on the kibbutz] did not want you to go to university because they needed you to continue working in the kibbutz,” Warshel said. “But I was among the few people who studied relatively hard [for the examination]. Very few people went to the examination [so they could continue their studies].”
Warshel originally had no idea what academic direction he wanted to go into, but while at university, he began to do experiments and found his interest to lie in biology and studying enzymes.
“When I started my PhD, I moved to a direction where we tried to use computers to study molecules and somehow this led to the understanding that you could use computers to model large molecules and proteins,” Warshel said. “And during the year, I started to realize that it is a very powerful approach.” 
Warshel began his research in Israel and England before coming to USC in 1976. Arriving at USC to teach chemistry, Warshal now continues his research in computational chemistry. 
Shina Caroline Lynn Kamerlin, a professor of structural biology at Uppsala University in Sweden, was a postdoctoral student under Warshel from 2007 to 2010 and said that he was the best principal investigator. 
“He’s just a great scientist,” Kamerlin said. “He’s really smart and stubborn and determined to kind of make things figure things out.”Anna Krylov, a professor of chemistry at USC and Warshel’s colleague, would describe him as insightful.
“When you talk to him about any problem, he will see some very important aspects of it, and sometimes, it will surprise you. He has this unexpected way of seeing things, so he has a kind of nonorthodox view on chemistry,” Krylov said. “You would tell him about a chemical problem and then he will see something about it that didn’t occur to you.”
Kamerlin first heard about the book when his assistant reached out to her asking to write the front cover blurb.
“I read the book during the summer and it was really good … And also what’s really nice is that he shares a huge amount of family photos when he’s very little all the way through,” Kamerlin said. “By the time I joined the [research] group, he was already in his mid 60s, so I’ve never met him as a young man. Seeing what he looks like as a kid and growing up, it’s always good to remember that everyone was young at some point in time.”
The book is targeted toward scientists interested in a biography and those hoping to progress science, Warshel said.
“The second half of the book talks in larger part on the scientific issues on how I solve different problems like designing drugs, understanding how vision works, how photosynthesis works in different fields and how to use computers and intuition,” Warshel said. “It is a combination of a personal biography and the emergence of computer simulations of biological molecules.” 
While Warshel’s book shares his personal biography, it also illustrates parts of his character. Kamerlin and Krylov both described Warshal as a humorous person and this was shown throughout the book.
“He might not necessarily like to perceive himself as funny, but I think he’s got a great sense of humor,” Kamerlin said. “That’s also the fun thing with reading the book because he’s got this sort of dry, very random sense of humor that I really appreciate.” 
After his book’s publication, Warshel continued to perform coronavirus-related research and publish papers on his discoveries. He published a paper Jan. 13 titled “Effect of Environmental Factors on the Catalytic Activity of Intramembrane Serine Protease.”
“I keep attacking scientific puzzles and problems all the time,” Warshel said. “At present, I am not trying to write another book, but maybe if Hollywood will call me to do a movie I will try.”

A habitual ride on an electric scooter ended in an ER visit and a semester off for Ty Kawamura. As he rode out of an alley on 28th St., Kawamura, who said he always follows the rules of the road while on an e-scooter, was hit and run over by an SUV. After spending the fall semester at home and healing from his injuries, Kawamura, a sophomore majoring in economics, said he won’t be riding e-scooters again.
According to interim Department of Public Safety Chief David Carlisle, e-scooter-related collisions have increased near campus over the past several years. DPS recorded 102 less total traffic and vehicle code infractions in 2021 compared to 2018 and 2019, during which an average of 278 infractions were recorded. However, Carlisle attributes the decrease in violations to the reduced presence on campus during the first five months of 2021 were held online. As in-person classes were not in session, DPS omitted statistics for 2020. 
The magnitude of the issue of e-scooter collisions is likely understated, Carlisle said, as most accidents go unreported. Since many of the reported collisions involved individuals riding e-scooters, Carlisle said he credits the increase, in part, to the rise in popularity of the motorized mobility devices. 
“We are concerned because what we observe is that students may not realize that, when they ride a motorized scooter, they’re supposed to follow the rules of the road,” Carlisle said.
The rules riders must follow, Carlisle said, include stopping at stop signs and red lights, yielding to pedestrians and not riding on roads with speed limits over 25 mph. Riding an e-scooter also requires a driver’s license, a fact which Carlisle said many students may not be aware of. 
E-scooters, either student-owned or rented through a scooter-sharing service such as Lime, Spin, Wind or Skip, operate at an average speed of 15 mph but can max out at speeds as high as 30 mph, according to e-scooter company Raine Co.  Elevated speeds and the tendency of riders to ride without helmets, which are only legally required for riders under the age of 18, render students who use e-scooters vulnerable and susceptible to potentially severe injury, Carlisle said. 
As a result of his accident last September, Kawamura suffered from a host of severe injuries, including skull fractures, broken ribs, a lacerated liver and a collapsed lung. The speed and subsequent risk of riding e-scooters, he said, is something that is easily, though wrongfully, overlooked by users. 
“It kind of seems less serious than it really is because you don’t really think you’re going as fast as you are,” Kawamura said. “I think people can think that.”
To help with the expenses of his treatment and recovery, Kawamura’s brothers at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, for which Kawamura served as treasurer, set up a GoFundMe page. The page has raised more than $26,000 at the time of publication to alleviate the costs of doctor appointments, physical therapy and surgeries for Kawamura’s family.
“It is truly a miracle and a blessing Ty is still with us today,” the page reads. “Every dollar pledged to this gofundme is a dollar spent in impacting the life of Ty and his family.”
James Moore, a professor of industrial and systems engineering and director of the University’s transportation engineering program, said traffic safety is “a longstanding problem” at USC. Moore, who has called North University Park home for 26 years, said changes to improve pedestrian safety in the past have involved streetscaping on Figueroa Street and pedestrian-exclusive cycles on Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue and have, “by and large,” proved effective. 
The recent trend of increased collisions, Moore said, might come as a result of lax behaviour on the part of both drivers and pedestrians. Moore said road users have become more reckless because of reduced traffic enforcement during the coronavirus pandemic and said speeds were “way up” as detected by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation Surveillance and Control System. 
“It may well be that we’re seeing riskier pedestrian behavior because there’s a perception of virtually no enforcement of infractions with respect to [the L.A. Police Department], and DPS doesn’t do traffic enforcement,” Moore said.
While unaware of the specific circumstances of rising traffic accidents, Moore said it’s reasonable to assume the heightened use of e-scooters near campus has driven the increase in collisions.
“Personal mobility devices put the riders, sometimes very quickly, in locations drivers don’t expect them to be,” Moore said. “If the riders are not going out of their way to inform drivers that they’re present or to behave in ways that the driver can predict, that could be a contributing factor.”
To prevent further collisions, Carlisle said DPS looks to educate students on the risks of using motorized scooters and similar mobility devices without proper safeguards. 
“Enforcement is a strategy that can be utilized within the right circumstances in order to reduce traffic collisions,” Carlisle said. “If this trend continues and we see students being hurt, then we will ask LAPD to help enforce the traffic laws around campus with the goal of protecting our students.”
Carlisle said he’d like to see students riding with more awareness and more attention to traffic laws that apply to them when they are on e-scooters and other mobility devices. 
“If [students] obey the rules and be courteous when they ride those motorized scooters and bicycles, we can reduce the number of collisions and prevent serious injuries from occurring,” Carlisle said.

Coronavirus positivity rates hit approximately 5% last week with approximately 2,000 new cases in the USC community, a USC spokesperson wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan Tuesday. The new positivity rate is a significant decrease from a 10.3% positivity rate for tests administered between Jan. 9 and Jan. 15 and an even bigger drop from between Jan. 2 and Jan. 8, when positivity rates were 14.79% and 12.48% for students and faculty, respectively.
Student Health anticipates cases to plateau or potentially increase slightly this week, then begin to drop sharply next week, the University confirmed to the Daily Trojan.
Booster rates increased, with 58% of USC students fully vaccinated and boosted. This marks a nearly 10% point increase from last week when 50% of eligible students were fully boosted and a 25% point increase from Jan. 3, when 23% of students were boosted. Students must upload their booster shots by Jan. 31. 
USC students who live on campus and test positive are transported to one of three hotels where they quarantine free of charge. The three hotels currently hosting USC students include the USC Hotel, the Hyatt House L.A. — University Medical Center and DoubleTree Hilton.
As the number of people in need of isolation increases, the University is working to reserve more rooms within the hotels, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said during a student health briefing Jan. 19. 
USC is also developing plans for when staff and faculty test positive and are unable to come to work and to combat understaffing issues, the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Wednesday. 
There is “a robust business continuity program requiring all schools and departments to have plans with strategies to address situations when there are impacts to staffing, facilities and technology,” the statement read.
Currently closed due to staffing shortages, the USC Pharmacy in the Student Union is redirecting students to the USC Health Center Pharmacy and the Lyon Center for vaccine appointments.

Diagnosed with a chronic illness during her second year at USC, Rachel Estrada almost gave up on her degree. She dropped out of college, as her disability prevented her from attending classes in person.
“I was struggling with severe fatigue — I had these chronic fevers and joint pain, muscle pain,” said Estrada, a senior majoring in philosophy. “There were times when I was just lying down in the lawn because my body was hurting that badly.”
But when Zoom came along with the pandemic, going back and finishing her degree became a reality. Estrada re-enrolled at USC, improved her grades, made the Dean’s List for the first time and was on track to graduate.
But virtual learning was never meant as a permanent addition. When USC announced early December a transition to in-person instruction for the first two weeks of the spring semester, there was no clarification as to whether virtual accommodations would continue through the transition. The Student Assembly for Accessibility and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation raised concerns via an Instagram post that USC may no longer be planning “to provide virtual accommodations (ex. hybrid option, recorded lectures) for [Office of Student Accessibility Services]-registered students.”  
“I heard that and I cried,” said Estrada about the Instagram post. “I was like, ‘I’m going to be one semester short of getting my degree,’ because, even with treatment, I’m just not able to physically [attend classes].” 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, OSAS clarified that virtual accommodations will continue in the midst of the omicron surge, “in order to minimize disability-related barriers and to ensure equal access.” OSAS said they had only notified a select few “students whose accommodations were set to expire,” reminding them of deadlines; Otherwise, registered students received neither confirmation nor denial as to whether virtual accommodations would continue. 
“As an undergraduate student that has been registered with OSAS, … I’ve never once received an email from OSAS stating that virtual accommodations were possible,” said Vincent Hsueh, co-executive director of SAA.
Before the University released clarification, some students, like Estrada, were left confused and unsure about whether accommodations would be provided for immunocompromised students and students with disabilities. 
“I thought I was going to have to drop out again,” Estrada said.
In addition to her symptoms, Estrada’s immunodeficiency meant in-person instruction was a tremendous risk. She takes immunosuppressive medications to treat her disability, which she said adds “additional stress” in worrying about contracting the coronavirus.
Estrada was not alone in her shock regarding the potential change in USC policy. A survey collecting student concerns, released alongside the post by SAA and SCALE, received upward of 1,000 responses in four days. 
“Most students were very concerned for their health and safety, especially in regards to getting COVID and … how campus life will be managed,” said Hsueh regarding the responses.
“USC left a lot of faculty, staff and students in a grey area, because … they haven’t made it really clear as to what [the in-person transition] pertains to,” Hsueh said. “Is this completely set in stone? Are there potential alternative routes?”
SAA initially planned to present the survey results to the Undergraduate Student Government at its Dec. 6 meeting before it was postponed indefinitely. It was only when Hsueh, along with co-director Kimi Zamora and USG vice president Lucy Warren, met with Associate Vice Provost for Institutional Accessibility and ADA Compliance Christine Street that he received direct clarification.
“I was then directly notified that there have been countless requests by students, requesting virtual accommodations through OSAS,” Hsueh said. “Only a select few have been approved for virtual accommodations. But those circumstances are very specific.”
According to OSAS’ statement to the Daily Trojan, this was business as usual. “OSAS’ overall accommodation process remains the same,” the statement read. “Accommodations are determined on an individualized basis through an interactive process.”
OSAS has yet to release public communication clearing up the confusion. In the meantime, Hsueh says SAA still has “continuously been receiving emails and requests from students to see whether or not virtual accommodations can be requested.”
Hsueh, a senior with a mobile disability, said he believes online learning and recorded lectures should be available as a permanent option. Under the current accommodations, it is “primarily up to the professor whether or not they feel comfortable offering their course via Zoom,” Hsueh said. “Not a lot of faculty members are entirely comfortable with the idea of being online again, especially as we return in person this semester.”
Even before the pandemic, Hsueh said he recalled some professors who would record their lectures and post them online. Hsueh said virtual lectures “definitely improved my experience at USC.” 
“If your education … has restrictions on it, then that directly negatively impacts the quality of your education,” he said.
Hsueh is not alone — he said SAA is even receiving emails asking whether there was “anything SAA can do on behalf of students to push for virtual classes to be available to not just students with special circumstances or disabilities but to the student body as a whole.”
Estrada also wishes online learning “wasn’t because of COVID,” but that it be available as “just an option.”
“People deserve to have the ability to watch every lecture that they missed,” she said. “There are a lot of people with illness that deserve to have the opportunity to go to the school of their dreams. They don’t deserve to lose that because they’re sick.”
Hsueh said he looks to “facilitate more dialogue in the student body,” in the hopes that “USC will make their statements more clear to students in order to avoid adding on to the growing concerns.”

hen “Hamilton” hit Broadway in August 2015, it caught the attention of theatre and non-theatre kids alike. A musical like no one had seen before — a diverse cast rapping the story of the Founding Fathers — Lin-Manuel Miranda’s work rose in popularity and with it grew the fans. 
Of course, when Broadway actress Amber Ardolino started making behind-the-scene TikToks of her life as a “Hamilton” swing (someone who understudies multiple roles), fans ate the content up. They flew to the comment section, filling it with questions and comments and even helped some of her videos reach as many as eight million views.  
One of Ardolino’s fan-favorite TikToks is a part of a recurring segment on her account in which she asks followers to comment which dance step she should do during the performance of “The Reynolds Pamphlet.” While most of the show is meticulously choreographed, dancers are given a chance to freestyle during this particular song. 
Followers suggest anything from a trending TikTok dance to the itsy bitsy spider. And to prove that she performed the most highly requested dance, Ardolino would post a video clip from that night’s performance. 
An entertaining segment that seems like all fun and games accidentally sparked a massive debate in the comments section over the ethics of Broadway bootleg recordings after another “Hamiton” star, John Devereaux, posted a TikTok with this caption:
“When management says you can’t record any of the show but you see a cast member blowing up on Tiktok for doing exactly that.”
The Broadway bootleg debate is as old as time. In many theatre circles, recording a Broadway show is frowned upon. It makes sense; bootlegging in general, is in fact, illegal. Camera glares or flashes can be extremely distracting to the people on stage. If people turn to Youtube to watch a Broadway show, that means less in-person attendance, and, in turn, less money in the performers’ pockets — and it is not like the arts get very much financial backing in the first place. 
While all of these frustrations are completely valid and understandable, there’s another side to Broadway bootlegging that Ardolino’s videos brought to light. There is a huge problem of inaccessibility when it comes to Broadway; the high prices of shows make the pool of potential audience members more “narrow” rather than “broad.”
Low-income communities rely on these clips, no matter how short, to get a taste of their favorite shows. However, many people disagree with this notion, such as Tony award-winning actress Stephanie J. Block, known for her work “Wicked,” “Falsettos” and “The Cher Show.” She tweeted:
“No. There is amazing theatre happening EVERYWHERE and at all price points, actually. There are discounts sites, there are two for ones, etc… Broadway is a special place and a special experience, but if planned for and saved for, it can be enjoyed. Speaking from my own life.”
While she does have a point, all of these discount tickets, lottery systems and two-for-ones are probably in high demand, even for those who can afford at value prices for shows. Not only that, not to discredit any of the amazing work that is happening at local theatres, people want to see the “real” thing. They want to see the big-budget productions of “Hamilton,” the versions that come from the cast recordings they are consuming on their walks or commutes. 
Many fans in Ardolino’s comments suggest that this is the case. And fans shared these sentiments in the comments of Devereaux’s video, after Ardolino, unfortunately, took down all of the TikToks including clips of the show. 
One user, @rosatheswiftie, commented:
“It’s giving…broadway is reserved for the elite and us poors shouldn’t get to see even a clip.”
Another, @melissabecraft, said:
“Not here for the drama. She makes Broadway feel relatable and fun to people who can’t experience it!”
The truth of the matter is that Ardolino’s videos were in no way equivalent to bootlegging full productions of the show and should not be treated as such. The criticism of her content was a little aggressive, but they were also significant in sharing everyday people’s opinions of the inaccessibility of Broadway. 
If anything, Ardolino’s video created free marketing for “Hamilton” but more importantly, it provided a safe and exciting community for theatre fans. It gave them a connection to the actors and made them feel like the bright lights of Broadway were not so far from reach — a feat I think benefits the Broadway world perfectly.

Rules Don’t Apply Records lit up The Virgil Friday night to celebrate the latest EP release from artist Life On Planets, “Nomad Lyfe.” The celebration featured a lineup of performances from a few of the label’s incredibly talented artists.
The evening’s roster ended on a high with an incredible performance by Life On Planets, the stars of the evening. The night also included some underground artists that fans of dance music might not recognize, such as Baby J and the incredible Astronomar. 
The Los Angeles local Marlon Lumba, better known as Astronomar, helms RDA as its label manager — and comes with receipts (as the kids say). With over 10 years of music production experience under his belt, Astronomar formed his style of dance music in resistance to mainstream EDM sounds. His previously released EP “Ya’ll Know” and track “High & Tight” are great examples of that approach and quintessential listens for any techno aficionado.
The same can be said for his new prodigy Phill Celeste, otherwise known by his stage name “Life On Planets.”
“Obviously, [Celeste’s] music is awesome,” Lumba said. “I love the tracks. These tracks were already in the pipeline before I got involved with the label, [but] it was fun to help piece stuff around … The music was already there [to] build around, and it’s super fun to have that approach.”
Lumba, while innocuous and genuine, alludes to a music production industry that can at times obfuscate a track’s source at the expense of underrepresented artists. In the case of RDA, tracks produced by label artists are celebrated for their authenticity and collaboration. 
After the soundcheck and a quick stop at the bar for a drink and some popcorn, audience members got a chance to chat with Life On Planets, or “Life — that’s just my name, Life!” 
“My inspiration was a lot of my father’s music, for ‘Nomad Lyfe’ in particular,” Life said. “Growing up we would listen to his mixtapes — like Cameo, Gap Band, Slave , all that funky stuff. He would have stuff sped up or slowed down, and I would hear all this insane music, all these crazy guitar solos and groovy beats.”
The influence of his crate-digging father certainly rubbed off on young Life and inspired the artist to become a professional multiinstrumentalist and DJ. But before ‘Nomad Lyfe,’ he had reserved the Life On Planets discography for strictly house music, not inspired genre fusions.
“I had never tried to incorporate any of that in my music thus far,” Life said. “I was trying to combine what I do with this house music stuff now with some of that funk stuff and sprinkle a little bit of trap and R&B soul on top.”
In 2020, Life and many other DJs turned to streaming platform Twitch to combat coronavirus shutdowns and continue to work during the pandemic. Though typically used to livestream video games, artists garnered massive audiences during live performances on the platform. Streaming on Twitch inevitably led Life to being billed on stream alongside RDA co-owners and equally badass performers Sam Walker and Gavin Royce, better known as their stage moniker Walker & Royce. The duo is best known for works like “Dance with Me” (co-produced with Chris Lake) and “Rave Grave” (co-produced with VNSSA).
“We were on the same bill, and after that my manager [said] ‘Walker & Royce heard you and want to maybe do a collab,’” Life said.
When asked why RDA was the label he chose to release his latest work, Life simply said, “the internet!” “the internet!” Life found that his ability to release music under RDA allowed him to maintain a level of artistic freedom that the proliferation of live-streaming was allowing artists now. That focus stems from his desire to keep his music globally and sonically accessible, which has been especially important during the coronavirus pandemic.
“They’re just so open,” Life said. “A lot of these other labels try to focus on one type of sound or one particular thing. ‘Nomad Lyfe,’ — It’s a record that has these housey influences and a lot of other influences, it’s not a strictly club record.”
The rest of the evening went along without a hitch as each performer took the stage, and despite coronavirus still going strong globally, fans and fellow entertainers in the crowd enjoyed the cathartic release that nothing else like a good night out dancing with friends could do.

At the conclusion of the three-day Southwestern Invitational in Westlake Village, Calif., the Trojans finished near the bottom of the leaderboard with a combined score of 29-over par. 
USC finished behind Pac-12 schools Arizona State, UCLA and Washington. The Sun Devils won the entire tournament. 
The invitational included both team and individual competitions among 12 schools. USC has won the tournament seven times, most recently in 2019.
Before the final round of competition, USC ranked ninth in the overall team leaderboard, bringing a score of 1-under 287 to move to 10-over 586. However, the Trojans shot 19-over par Wednesday — the second to lowest finish of all the schools. 
Sophomore Shane Ffrench had the highest overall score for USC, shooting 6-over par over three rounds. He played his season-best 2-under par in the second round then concluded with 5-over par Wednesday. 
Ffrench finished as the highest scoring Trojan in the player leaderboard at 31st. He was voted in the 2021 All-Pac-12 Newcomer Team after last season. 
Freshman Jackson Rivera had a strong display going into the last day of competition after back-to-back rounds of 1-under par. He tied for 12th in the player leaderboard at 2-under 142 after six birdies on Tuesday and team-best eighth round of par or better. 
Even though Rivera led the Trojans after the first day of play on Monday, he shot a 9-over par Wednesday to finish tied for 34th in the player leaderboard. Ffrench managed to take over Rivera on the leaderboard.
Although senior Cameron Henry also notched 1-under 71 Tuesday he finished with a 7-over par on Wednesday for a final score of +13. 
Ffrench birdied five of seven holes on Tuesday and finished with a 2-under par performance, tying for 29th place. Henry tied for 41st place at 6-over par after three straight birdies between holes 15 and 17. 
Making his Trojan debut as an individual, junior Parker Sisk tied for 48th in the player leaderboard after two straight days of shooting 2-over par. 
Sisk and sophomore Krando Nishiba tied at 33rd after Monday. However, Nishiba shot a 7-over par in the second round and 3-over in the final round to tie for 40th with a score of +10. Freshman Gavin Aurillia finished with 16-over par after shooting 4-over Wednesday. 
USC’s next tournament is the John A. Burns Invitational in Hawaii Feb. 17 to 19.

This year’s Australian Open featured a plethora of former Trojans taking center stage competing in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. USC had the most former collegiate athletes compete in the tournament this year with seven former Trojans taking part. Here are the ex-USC tennis players from this year’s Australian Open and their results.
Kaitlyn Christian — Women’s doubles
Playing in her 16th career Grand Slam tournament, Kaitlyn Christian started the new season with her doubles partner Lidziya Marozava. Christian’s best finish came during the 2019 Australian Open, where she reached the third round in the tournament. 
In the first round, Christian and her partner matched up against Petra Martic and Shelby Rogers. It was a hard fought two-set match lasting nearly two hours, but Christian and Marozava lost to Rogers and Martic 7-4 in the tiebreaker.
Giuliana Olmos —
 Mixed doubles and women’s doubles
Giuliana Olmos was busy at the Australian Open this year, competing in both women’s doubles and mixed doubles. Coming off of a trip to the quarterfinals at last year’s Australian Open, Olmos and her partner Gabriela Dabrowski were the No. 6 seed going into the tournament. In the first round they won in straight sets, not letting up a break. In the second round Olmos and Dabrowski faded away, losing an intense three-set match.
Olmos and her partner Marcelo Arevalo faced off against the No. 1 seed and defending French Open Champions Desirae Krawczyk and Joe Salisbury for the mixed doubles draw. Olmos and Arevalo were able to pull off the upset, winning in a third set tiebreaker to knock off the top duo. In the second round, Lucie Hradecka and Gonzalo Escobar beat Olmos and Arevalo in straight sets, ending Olmos’ quick, yet exciting tournament. 
Sabrina Santamaria — Women’s doubles
In Sabrina Santamaria’s fourth straight trip to the Australian Open, she competed in women’s doubles with Miyu Kato. In the first round, they faced a challenge against the No. 4 seed duo Samanta Stosur and Shuai Zhang. 
In what turned into a long match, Santamaria and Kato fell in a three-set bout that would end Santamaria’s tournament early after she progressed past the first round two of the last three years at the Australian Open.
Robert Farah — 
Men’s doubles and 
mixed doubles
Robert Farah, currently ranked No. 10 in the world for doubles, came into the tournament with his partner Juan Sebastian Cabal as the No. 4 seed. Farah has a history of success at the Australian Open, reaching the final back in 2018. Farah and Cabal handled business in the first round of men’s doubles by winning in straight sets. In the second round, Farah and Cabal started where they left off, winning the first set. However, as the match progressed, the two let up and ultimately dropped the match. The duo that beat them, Matthew Ebden and Max Purcell, has since gone on to make the semifinals for men’s doubles.
Farah also competed in mixed doubles with Nicole Melichar-Martinez, who is ranked No. 14 in the world for women’s doubles. Farah and Melichar-Martinez lost in straight sets 6-4, 6-4 in the first round. Unable to break their opponents, the two exited the tournament early on.
Emilio Gomez —
Men’s singles
In his first career Australian Open, Emilio Gomez went through three rounds of qualifying matches. He handled the first two rounds swiftly, not dropping a single set in the process. In the qualifying match final, Gomez faced off against Thomas Fabbiano. Gomez started off strong winning the first set 7-5 but then dropped the second set. 
In the final set, Gomez officially secured himself a spot in the tournament, winning 6-3. In the first round, Gomez got matched up against Marin Cilic, who currently ranks No. 27 in the world. Cilic defeated Gomez in straight sets, ending his tournament run.
Yannick Hanfmann — 
Men’s Singles
Yannick Hanfmann also completed the qualifying stages to secure a spot in the tournament. After securing a win in the first round, his final two qualifying matches were close until the very end. He went on to win his second-round match in straight sets, with each set ending in a tiebreaker. The final qualifying match took the same course, and Hanfmann squeezed his way into the tournament.
Hanfmann set his sights on his first round matchup against Thanasi Kokkinakis. Carrying over his momentum from the qualifying rounds, he defeated Kokkinakis in straight sets without dropping serve. In the second round, Hanfmann matched up against 20-time Grand Slam singles winner Rafael Nadal. Hanfmann’s run came to a close, as Nadal cruised on to the next round. 
Steve Johnson – 
Men’s Singles
A two-time NCAA singles champion, Steve Johnson made his ninth career appearance at the Australian Open. In the first round, he matched up against Jordan Thompson in what would end as a five set thriller. The first two sets both ended in tiebreakers with each player taking a win, but after dropping the third set, Johnson would handle business the rest of the way. 
Johnson finished the match winning the last two sets 6-3, 6-3, securing a spot in the second round. In the second round, Johnson took on Jannik Sinner who is currently ranked No. 10 in the world. Johnson would end up losing to Sinner in straight sets as he bowed out of the tournament.

If you were lucky enough to have made it to the “Regenerate” event at the USC Fisher Art museum last October, you’ll be familiar with the Arts and Climate Collective. A collaboration among USC Arts in Action, the USC Office of Sustainability and USC Annenberg Innovation Lab, the group provides funding grants and a common forum to help student artists produce sustainability oriented projects.
After the success of its inaugural group of grantees last spring, the organization assembled its Fall 2021 cohort, which organizers say features an even greater variety of art forms.
“I feel like with this cohort, it’s so special because of the wide range of projects there are,” said Diana Salinas Vargas, ACC’s 2021-22 intern. “When we were reading applications, it was so difficult because everyone had such unique projects.”
Salinas Vargas, a junior majoring in public policy, helped plan “Regenerate” and is fascinated by the intersection of sustainability and art. She serves as a firsthand account of the first cohort’s success in achieving its goal of climate advocacy through art.
“I’m honestly very new to the sustainability world, the environmental justice world,” Salinas Vargas said. “But when I went [to ‘Regenerate’], I was like, ‘I feel a part of this. I feel included.’ There was no moment I felt like an outsider … I understood the urgency of solving these problems, and I think that’s where ACC entices [me] the most, making it accessible through the art.”
Other members of the collective were similarly pleased with the outcome of last semester’s projects. Hannah Findling, co-director of the ACC, expressed her satisfaction at the turnout for “Regenerate.”
“The only thing I was upset about was that we had to turn students away,” Findling said. “We had a big space, but because of COVID, the numbers were slashed way down … That really showed us how much desire there is in the student body to have those types of spaces and events.”
Looking forward to this next semester, the collective has approved grants of $1,350 for 18 projects, providing 20 students with funds to pursue their work. The approved works span across University departments and encourage collaboration among artists across mediums.
“I would say that our first cohort stuck a little bit closer to more traditional forms of art activism [like] films and podcasts,” Findling said. “With this new cohort, it’s a lot more diverse, there’s a huge range in types of projects. We’ve got everything from paintings and sculptures to people doing multimedia zines and interactive websites to people creating different types of platforms and poetry.”
The range of media also speaks to the universality of climate change and environmentalism, especially to artists of younger generations. It serves as an example, Findling said, of how varied the paths are to getting involved with environmental activism.
“I think it really illustrates how many different ways there are to be involved in and to work on this issue,” Findling said. “And [it brings] together people from so many different disciplines and art forms and backgrounds that all care about the same thing and have the same similar goals.”
Beyond connecting student artists with each other, the collective also works hard to platform voices from the community in their work and events. At “Regenerate,” renowned youth climate activist Nalleli Cobo spoke about her experience growing up in University Park, across the street from a toxic oil well. Her moving testimony reminded listeners of their place in the fight for environmental justice in South Central, and her calls to action combined with speeches from other community organizers called on attendees to participate in local campaigns.
Despite uncertainty around coronavirus precautions, the collective has a tentative date of April 20 for their Spring 2022 event. In speaking about their plans, organizers intend to highlight the presence of community voices in their next event.
“A lot of [environmental] issues are part of the surrounding USC community and sometimes USC has a lot to do with it, so we definitely want to bring [those] voices inside” Salinas Vargas said. “Obviously [community members] don’t owe [us] anything … but we would definitely love to further that [collaboration] especially in our next ‘Regenerate’ event.”
Findling concurs on that focus, emphasizing the importance of spaces dedicated to communication and expression. The directors of the ACC, she said, are committed to encouraging expression not just among its cohort but for all University students. 
“USC is huge,” Findling said. “A lot of people care about this issue and find art as a way that they can express that and contribute to [combating] the issue. But it can be a little bit hard to do on your own, whether logistically, emotionally or all the different meanings of what it means to do it on your own versus do it in a group. And so, my recommendation would be [to] find your people, the people that inspire you, and give you that hope and that drive to create and to build.”

No. 15 men’s basketball team will face Stanford at home Thursday at 8 p.m. The Trojans will look to take down the team that handed them their first loss of the season two weeks ago. 
USC has won their previous three games, with their most recent victory Monday against Arizona State. The Trojans looked dominant in their 47-point second half despite a slow start. 
Senior guard Drew Peterson led the team with 16 points and junior forward Max Agbonkpolo continued his hot streak with 12 points and 6 rebounds in just 16 minutes of play. Agbonkpolo has averaged 10 points per game in 18 minutes per game over the last three contests.  
“Everyone’s really excited to play Stanford again,” Agbonkpolo said. “It was our first loss this year to them, so we’re ready to give it back to them.”
USC announced that fans would be allowed at home games once again as classes returned to in-person Monday Jan. 24. Agbonkpolo, who has started roughly half of USC’s games, said fans returning to Galen Center will boost the Trojans.  
“The fans definitely help a lot,” Agbonkpolo said. “The only games we lost were two without fans, which is funny to me … The fans being [there] tomorrow, you’re going to see a different team tomorrow for sure.” 
USC’s defense allowed Stanford to score 75 points in their last meeting. The Cardinal led in scoring by freshman forward Harrison Ingram and junior forward Spencer Jones, who each had 21 points. 
“Our defense has been much, much better in the last three games,” USC Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “That’s the type of defense we expect.” 
Stanford is 1-2 in their last three games, with losses to Washington and Arizona. They gave up a 15-point lead against Arizona State, but came back to win the game 79-76 Saturday. 
“Stanford has a lot of experience,” Enfield said. “We didn’t play very well on the road against Stanford … Give them credit, they played very well and they beat us.” 
Junior forward Isaiah Mobley continues to star on both sides of the ball. The 6-foot-10 junior has put in his best performances at home, increasing his shooting accuracy by roughly 13% and scoring 4 more points on average than in away games. Mobley had 16 points in USC’s last game against Stanford and looks to improve on their last outing against the Cardinal.  
“We just [need to] be intense the whole time,” Mobley said. “I feel like if we do that, if we’re urgent on both offense and defense I think we’ll be fine.” 
In their loss to Stanford, USC shot a mere 28.6% from the 3-point line. While the Trojans’ height allows for plenty of scoring in the paint, Agbonkpolo, Peterson and junior guard Boogie Ellis will look to shoot more accurately than they did at Stanford. The trio went a combined 23% from behind the arc. 
The Trojans have faced issues with fouling this season, committing 14.7 personal fouls per game. Sending Stanford to the free throw line proved a key factor in USC’s loss, and playing disciplined defense will be important for USC to win. 
With the Pac-12 Tournament approaching, USC is beginning to think about the postseason. 
“[Enfield] has made a point, starting with Arizona State, like ‘it’s separation week,’” Mobley said. “There’s not too many games left in the Pac-12 … so we just [need to] keep winning and doing what we can to set ourselves up to be in the best position for March.”

As the 75th anniversary season of the NBA approaches its halfway mark, these former USC stars have stood out for their respective teams.
Power forward/center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
Evan Mobley currently averages 15 points and 8.1 rebounds per game for the Cleveland Cavaliers, making him one of six rookies since 2000 to average at least 15 points, 7 rebounds and 2 assists per game.
Cleveland’s No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 draft, Mobley ranks third in scoring average, first in rebounding and first in blocks among all first-year players. He has 10 double-doubles this season, one of which came in the Cavaliers’ 95-93 victory Monday with 15 points, 12 rebounds and 5 assists.  
Mobley’s impact on the Cavaliers has emerged as a front-runner for Rookie of the Year.
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
A dark-horse MVP candidate, DeMar Derozan has recently picked up slack due to the absences of guards Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso. The 6-foot-6-inch tall, 220 pound guard averages 26.3 points, 5 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game this season.
DeRozan’s scoring has jumped around 5 points per game from last season. He exploded with a season-high 41 points, along with 5 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals Sunday in a 114-95 loss to the Orlando Magic. He has scored 30 or more points more than 12 times this season.
Derozan now plays alongside former Trojan teammate, center Nikola Vucevic, as well as former crosstown rival guards Zach LaVine and Ball. 
Power forward Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
Onyeka Okongwu’s availability has been limited while recovering from an offseason shoulder surgery, but his minutes per game have roughly doubled from his rookie season. Since returning, he has averaged 9.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per game in the last 14 games.
On the defensive side of the ball, Okongwu clocks in 1.8 blocks per game in his limited time, which would put him in eighth place in the league if he played enough games to qualify. His presence in the paint should continue to increase as he heals from his injury.  
Guard Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets
This season, Kevin Porter Jr. averages 13.2 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game in a point guard role for a struggling Houston team. Porter’s growth as a point guard has helped a Rockets offense that ranks 27th in the league in offensive rating.
In the Rockets’ last game against the Utah Jazz, Porter Jr. was two assists short of a double-double. He contributed 15 points and 8 assists in 31 minutes in the 116-111 win.
Porter Jr. has shown up in the clutch this season, hitting multiple long-range shots late in games. Against the Washington Wizards Jan. 5, Porter Jr. hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to propel Houston to a 114-111 victory.

Omicron isn’t the only plague ruining 2022: Coldplay fans, commitment issues and snarky comments from mothers are equally, if not more, malignant. 
Many things deserve to be abandoned in the past, but if Coldplay’s music, which probably should’ve been left in 2012, has somehow managed to creep into the present, bad habits are even more prone to be carried into the new year.
One thing that certainly hasn’t been abandoned is “Advice from Dr. Blingspice” where I — a self-proclaimed therapist who knows everything about everything — generously provide my input in other people’s business.
​​My crush is trying to get me into Coldplay, and I don’t have the heart to tell him that their music slaps on mute. What should I do?
Everyone is bound to have at least one flaw, and fortunately, being a Coldplay listener is sometimes a forgivable one. It takes a lot of courage for their fans to come out, and we can at least give credit to Chris Martin for “Clocks.” 
Your suffering should be their suffering. The most ideal thing to do is have them endure one of your questionable music choices and make it an “eye for an eye” situation. Everyone has at least one music artist they listen to that raises some eyebrows; these include Halsey, Bhad Bhabie and RuPaul, just to name a few. Play these for your crush, and if he stays, he’s a real trooper.
Alternatively, assuming your crush is someone sculpted by God, it’s possible to look past his Coldplay tendencies and pretend you love their songs. If you really want to sell the lie, make sure to do the one, two, step to “Viva La Vida.” Either you force your crush to listen to your terrible music taste too or you force-feed yourself Coldplay’s discography for the sake of love.
I’ve been seeing this guy for over a month, and we like each other. We spend almost every day together, but I’m not ready to be a girlfriend yet and kind of want to see other people. What should I do?
As a self-proclaimed therapist, it’s not only my job to give counsel but also to read people when they make mistakes. 
It’s okay to admit you have commitment issues as long as you disclose it early in the entanglement. However, if you’re leading the poor man on for an entire month, you should tell him your intentions sooner rather than later. We have more means of communicating than ever, it’s time for you to put them to use. While I endorse being sexy and mysterious, relationships are no place for ambiguity.
The only solution is to confront him about your end goal for the fling. If his intentions align with yours and he has commitment issues too, you’ve hit the jackpot. If he’s looking for your hand in marriage, it’s unfortunately time to bid farewell and get back on the dating apps.
I am going to see my long-distance boyfriend, and my parents made me promise not to sleep with him. Little do they know I already did months ago. My mom says I’d regret it because it was too soon. I don’t regret it. I do want to be able to talk to her about my relationship with him and be honest about that. Plus she picks apart every little thing about him that she dislikes. She says, “You could have done worse.” Like what? He’s my first boyfriend, and we’ve been dating for almost a year now.
There’s a lot to dissect, but luckily, my faux doctorate in Other People’s Business trained me for situations like this.
Mothers are skilled in snarky comments, so don’t take them to heart. Unless there’s a reason to dislike your long-distance boyfriend (e.g. he listens to Coldplay) you don’t need her validation to feel like your choice in men is tasteful. If there are redeeming qualities, she’ll eventually recognize them.
Snarks aside, you’re a college student with autonomy. Your parents should not be intruding on your sex life or concerned with whether or not you’ve slept with your boyfriend. Everyone’s a little nosy but there are boundaries; parents and sex is one of them. As NeNe Leakes once said, “It’s getting weird.” 
In an ideal world, we’d all be open books with our parents, but unfortunately, there are always topics you can’t talk to them about without their judgment looming over you. In your case, time will hopefully work in your favor and your mom will see the pros in your long-distance relationship.

Recognizing the importance of mental health has been a long-winded battle within communities that have historically placed it on the backburner. Too often, struggles of mental illness go undiagnosed and untreated in communities of color. For the Latinx community, these types of struggles are often written off as “fake.” 
About one-third of Latinx people who experience mental health issues are treated, in stark contrast to the 50% of non-Latinx people who do opt for treatment, according to the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The question still remains: Why? 
As a Latinx person, I know firsthand how mental health is handled, particularly in a Mexican American household where the issue of fearing to ask for help is often untouched.  The words “mental health” had never been uttered growing up in my household, and it was not until high school that I was able to gauge what mental illnesses were and how one could receive a diagnosis and treatment. The first time I stepped foot into a therapist’s office was in college. I did so quietly, not informing family or friends about the mental health journey I was about to embark on. 
Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon journey Latinx community members deal with. As covered in Oprah Daily, only 20% of Latinx people talk with their primary care physician about mental health, and only 10% ask for help. According to a Salud America! research review, this is worse for the younger populations, with 22% of Latinx youth dealing with depression — which only accounts for those who have openly expressed their struggle. 
The trauma of being first generation and carrying the burden of success placed on one’s back has severely hindered my own ability to advocate for myself and normalize the emotions I deal with on a daily basis. It took being hospitalized alone in Los Angeles for the avenue of talking about mental health to open in my house. 
Mental health struggles are often written off as normal feelings one should deal with alone. The notion of taking medication is even more frowned upon than recognizing mental health in the first place. Therapy is stigmatized to be for “locos.” It took a lot of unlearning to realize that medication is meant to treat mental illness and is sometimes the only way to lead a normal life. 
To just “be happy” or “think happy thoughts” are ideas I’m sure many others have heard. Simply sitting down and describing how mental illness is a result of chemical imbalances was tough for my parents to grasp. Even family closer to my age asked when I would be off my medication and urged that to be a goal I set for myself.
It is scary to talk about mental health, even more so when family and friends treat it as a hush-hush subject for the majority of one’s life. An additional barrier is the inaccessibility to mental health treatment for Latinx communities. People whose first language is Spanish or prefer to receive information in Spanish have a small pool of mental health resources that can cater to their needs.
In the United States, only 5.5% of mental health practitioners are licensed to give treatment in Spanish, out of the 18% of psychiatrists who are Latinx. In California, 39% of therapists are Latinx, but only about 23% of them can offer care in Spanish. 
When talking about Latinx issues like Catholicism, “machismo,” or generational trauma, it’s hard to find the right words in English and even more difficult for a non-Latinx person to fully gauge the level of importance “Latinidad” has on one’s mental health.
USC has begun to address that gap by offering therapy in spaces like the Latinx/Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs, Asian Pacific American Student Services and the LGBTQ+ Student Center, with professionals who identify with those communities. However, making an appointment can often be difficult as the needed surge for mental health treatment has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Even taking the step to make an appointment can seem like an internal battle, especially when doing it alone for fear of judgment from family. Although many will opt to undergo this process alone, it is important to note that other Latinx community members are feeling the same way and there are peers at USC, such as myself, who have been in that same position. Feeling the support of other Latinx people and seeing more Latinx professionals in the field is an important first step in destigmatizing mental health — one that I hope this article begins to stimulate.
