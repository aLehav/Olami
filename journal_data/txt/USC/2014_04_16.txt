Korean Culture Night was held at Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday night and consisted of a play “Save Our Souls,” as well as several performances by various Korean students and Korean student groups at USC.

“S.O.S was a really engaging tale that opened my eyes to the horrors that happen behind the scenes in sex trafficking,” said Jonathan Seo, a freshman majoring in accounting.
Over 30 USC staff members and actors were involved in the production of the show. This year’s Korean Culture Night was not only used to promote Korean culture, but also to raise awareness about the issue of sex trafficking.
“For the past three years, Korean Culture Night at USC has always been centered around the theme of hope — hope for the boy from a family of illegal immigrants in 2012, hope for the Korean adoptee finding her identity in America in 2013 and, this year, hope for both the victim and the victimizer in sex trafficking,” said Rachelle Song, executive producer of Korean Culture Night.
The event not only drew USC students, but also attracted the parents of students involved in the show, as well as Korean students from other nearby universities such as UCLA. The show featured Wayne Park as Bryant Choi, Sophiea Kim as Robin Huhr, Kevin Lee as Luke, Joshua Moon as Han and Alice Han as Grace.
“USC Korean Culture Night was not only a great performance with wonderful talent, but it also emphasized the importance of being aware of our surroundings and being actively a part of ending human sex trafficking in our society,” said April Kang, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
With excellent performances from all actors and actresses and several particularly moving scenes, the play proved to be an eye-opening experience for many members of the audience.
“I personally felt like the performance was great, with lots of eye-opening and thought-provoking parts, but it did drag on for a little,” said Samuel Joo, a freshman majoring in computer science.
Korean Culture Night was divided into two acts with a total of 15 scenes. It also featured Off the Grid, one of USC’s dance groups, and Haneulsori, a traditional Korean drum and instrument group at USC.
“Some may say that one night of highlighting this issue won’t do much, but we disagree,” said Rachael Lee, the executive director of Korean Culture Night 2014. “One night can open the eyes of many people who may not have known how prevalent sex trafficking is in our communities. One night has the potential to inspire a person to rise up as a leader of a movement. So our aim for Korean Culture Night is not a simple night of entertainment. We want to use Korean Culture Night to say something, to open eyes.”

On Wednesday, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation hosted a rally at Tommy Trojan for the 18 students that participated in a sit-in outside President Max C.L. Nikias’ office Tuesday afternoon.
Free speech · SCALE members Matthew Shoemaker and Julia Wang speak in front of Tommy Trojan about their experiences in Tuesday’s sit-in. – Matt Lemas | Daily Trojan
The event, “Trojan 18 Rally: We Will Not Be Silenced,” consisted of testimonials from those who took part in Tuesday’s protest — a demonstration against USC’s continued business relations with JanSport, an apparel brand whose parent company, VF Corporation, SCALE claims is directly linked to numerous factory collapses and worker deaths.
The 18 students remained outside Nikias’ office for four hours, and at Wednesday’s rally, those who were inside expressed great discontent with how campus administration dealt with the situation.
“The thing that I learned yesterday was I have never been more ashamed of going to a university where our president refuses to listen to its students,” said SCALE member Julia Wang during the rally.
Those who participated in the sit-in yesterday noted that administrators threatened the students with phone calls to parents, revocation of financial aid and suspension. Francesca Bessey, a junior majoring in international relations, specifically called these threats as a blatant use of “scare tactics.”
“I had my parents called because I was ‘behaving badly,’ ”Bessey said at the event. “What we’re really dealing with is an intentional use of scare tactics to intimidate [us] and emotionally intimidate our parents.”
Bessey humorously recalled that the last time her parents were called for “bad behavior” was when she was nine years old, and that USC’s actions showed a lack of respect for the students’ maturity.
“This university does not think that we are adults — that they have to respect and deal with us and actually address [our concerns],” she said.
SCALE member Sarah Newell also offered her testimonial from the sit-in, and expressed hope for a brighter future where student’s voices will be heard.
“No student should ever feel ignored, no student should ever feel disrespected or feel like we don’t have a voice or the ability to make change — we’re not going to stand for it,” Newell said at the rally. “We will continue to fight until every student on this university feels like they have a voice.”
Following the testimonials, SCALE members left Tommy Trojan and walked to Bovard Auditorium hoping to deliver another letter to Nikias’ office detailing their requests. Upon the group’s arrival, the doors to Bovard were locked.
“You can’t get into a public building at our own university,” said Faiz Jaspar Abu-Jaber, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “For some reason, USC seems to think we are so terrifying, that we are so evil, that we are not allowed to enter the hallway outside of the secretary’s office outside the office of our president.”
In response to yesterday’s sit-in, Vice Provost of Student Affairs Dr. Ainsley Carry emailed a statement to the Daily Trojan detailing that the university does not work with licensed vendors in Bangladesh, and that opposition to current policies was led by a “relatively small number of students.”
“No USC licensed vendor is producing USC merchandise in Bangladesh,” Carry wrote. “A relatively small number of students have requested that USC use tuition money to support organizations and causes that have nothing to do with USC.”
After the rally, Newell told the Daily Trojan that SCALE has never accused USC of currently working in Bangladesh and that the things Carry wrote were explicitly false.
“Personally, we’re offended by [Carry’s statement,] because                 Dr. Carry has accused us of spreading mistruths in the past and now he seems to be doing it himself,” Newell said. “SCALE has never claimed that USC is currently working in Bangladesh … We are not asking USC to give money to any causes or organizations that don’t relate to USC — this is [about] Trojan dollars going to brands that kill workers and all we want is a stop to that pipeline.”
SCALE member Hannah Nguyen made it clear that this was not the end for the organization. She said they will continue efforts to work with USC in the future.
“I am absolutely hurt, I am absolutely disappointed [by the university’s actions,]” Nguyen said during the rally. “But I am also incredibly fired up for what’s going to happen next because we will be back … we have integrity, we have the truth, we have justice on our side and we will win.”

The Undergraduate Student Government senate struck down a resolution this week in support of a federal bill that would allow tax-deductible donations for Greek housing.
The author of the resolution, Tara Campbell, a junior majoring in political science and broadcast and digital journalism, believes USG’s actions are indicative of a bias against the Greek community.
“The sense I’m getting is that people don’t like anything that benefits Greeks — they see Greeks as a privileged community,” she said.
Campbell is going to Washington D.C. to lobby in support of said bill, The Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act.
“Right now, if you give a donation, it’s not tax a deduction,” Campbell said. “This means many people who would ordinarily give a donation, don’t.”
The act currently has bipartisan backing in Congress. If passed, it would allow nonprofit organizations such as sororities or fraternities to receive tax-deductible donations from alumni or supporters.
Campbell claims USC has the funds and obligation to improve housing, but frequently, fraternities or sororities who are owned by national chapters do not.
“A lot of Greek houses at USC don’t have simple things like fire sprinklers,” Campbell said. “It’s a safety issue.”
Senators who voted against the bill, however, thought that Campbell’s assessment of the resolution as a “safety issue” was misleading.
“The main reason I didn’t support it is that the angle with which it was presented contrasts with the bill itself,” said Residential Senator Aziz Akbari. “There’s nothing in the actual bill talking about safety.”
The resolution claims that tax-deductible  donations would encourage “charitable contributions,” which could be applied to safety systems. There is no stipulation, however, that this has to be the case.
In response to the concern that fraternities and sororities do not have adequate safety systems such as fire extinguishers, Akbari said that the amount Greek houses would gain from tax breaks would exceed the cost of repairs.
“Most of these renovations are one-time costs,” Akbari said. “And the tax breaks would be around forever.”
Another concern was that the benefits of such a resolution would extend to only a small portion of the student body.
Though USG has no obligation to support the resolution, Campbell believes that USC stands to benefit from it as a school with a relatively high amount of Greek students.
“I did extensive research — 9 percent of [the] student body lives in Greek housing and a quarter of students are Greek,” Campbell said. “Those are, quite frankly, outrageous numbers.”
Campbell went to USG two weeks ago to propose the resolution, and USG president, Andrew Menard, spoke briefly in support of it. Campbell said she was very optimistic about the resolution’s chances, and was surprised that it didn’t pass.
“I presented it [and] not really any questions were had,” Campbell said. “It seemed like [the outlook] was optimistic. I’m shocked and disappointed by the undergraduate senators.”
Campbell believes that the senators’ decisions reflect an unfair, anti-Greek bias.
“Even if you’re non-Greek, odds are you’ve still been to a party or eaten at a Greek house,” Campbell said.
Senators who voted against the bill contend that they did support the idea as well Greek students in general, just not the wording of the resolution.
“Safety is a big issue for us, and we support safety, but the worry is that the money from tax breaks would go towards other things,” Akbari said.
Campbell sees the USG Senate’s decision as indicative of a widening rift between Greek and non-Greek students at USC.
“I have a signature from the vice president of federal relations at USC in support of this bill,” Campbell said. “They are signing letters to our representatives. I would have been able to say, ‘My student government supports this,’ but now I can’t.”

Undergraduate Student Government hosted a wide variety of student leaders at a dinner on Wednesday night for a gathering of the “Council of Presidents.” The event, which was co-hosted by Delta Omicron Zeta, a co-educational leadership fraternity, brought together student leaders from across campus organizations for a chance to cooperate and network.
Fine dining · Keynote Speaker Kelly Porter, a USC alumnus and managing director at Woodside Capital Partners, speaks to the audience about the important of perseverance. – Kevin Fohrer| Daily Trojan
The aim of the event, held at the Radisson Hotel, was to provide an opportunity for student leaders to mingle, exchange ideas and collaborate. Though USG has hosted similar events in the past, this year was the first time the gathering was hosted as a formal banquet Different representatives from over 80 organizations were in attendance.
The dinner featured distinguished alumni guests — including leaders in business, law and news media — as well as a keynote speaker.
The event began with brief introductions from leaders in DOZ as well as USG, including newly-inaugurated vice president-elect Rini Sampath.
“We’re here to celebrate the accomplishments of numerous organizations,” Sampath said.
The event included a brief overview of the organizations at USC as well as a list of their accomplishments this year.
Samantha Brown, a senior majoring in psychology and president of USC eSports, also noted the achievements of the different organizations represented. “It was interesting to see all of the organizations and their accomplishments,” Brown said. “It definitely puts into perspective what our organization has done compared to them.”
USC eSports is a competitive gaming club with over several hundred members. The club has hosted three tournaments this year, the most of any year, including a USC-UCLA rivalry tournament, according to Brown.
The majority of the event comprised of the interactions between the students of various organizations and distinguished alumni.
Joridan Barash, a freshman majoring in french horn performance who also serves as president of the Sack of Troy, a satirical news magazine at USC, noted that the opportunity to speak with alumni was beneficial.
“It was really nice to talk to people from clubs that aren’t similar to mine,” he said. “There’s a lot to learn from people of different organizations. But most of all, I enjoyed talking to the alumni. I even got some specific advice in investments.”
Michael Reilly was one of the distinguished alumni at the event. He graduated from USC in 1985 with degrees in finance and Spanish, and also earned an MBA from the Marshall School of Business in 1986. He currently serves as the chief investment officer of the equities division at TCW Group, an investment firm located in downtown Los Angeles. He noted that USC has developed its enrichment experiences since his graduation.
“I had a tremendous experience attending USC, and there were many opportunities at the time I attended,” Reilly said. “But now that I come back to campus and see such a diverse group of enrichment activities, study abroad, alternative spring break, and all of the different ways students can network and get leadership experience and volunteer in the community is just really impressive. I think that that is going to prepare them very well as they go out into larger society and undertake leadership roles out in the professional world.”
Tyler Makin a president of USC Racing, appreciated talking to other students who had passion for their organizations. USC Racing is a club that builds race cars from scratch and competes against over 80 teams from all over the world.
“It’s always cool to get together with some other student leaders and see the other people at USC who are really passionate about at least one thing,” Makin said.
The event concluded with a speech by keynote speaker and USC alumnus Kelly Porter, who graduated from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 1985 and later earned his master’s degree as a Sloan fellow from Stanford University. He currently serves as managing director at Woodside Capital Partners, an investment bank based in Palo Alto, Calif.
He began his speech with  light-hearted jokes about USC rivals UCLA and Notre Dame. He also touched on more serious topics, however, describing setbacks in his own career path, which included stints at the Home Shopping Network and Fox Cable Networks, after his graduation from USC. He offered advice to aspiring leaders in attendance.
“I can promise you that in your career and your life, you will experience some real obstacles, some of which will probably be enormously debilitating,” Porter said. “When that happens, be resilient, pull yourself up by the bootstraps, and be relentless.”

The Mountain Pacific Sports Federation schedule will come to a dramatic end this weekend for USC women’s lacrosse, with the team needing to beat either Oregon or Stanford to qualify for the conference tournament. Luckily for the Women of Troy (7-6, 5-2 MPSF), both games will played at home.
Friday’s contest against the Ducks (8-5, 4-1) will be played at McAlister Field, while Sunday’s matchup against the Cardinal (11-2, 5-1) will take place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It will be the first time since the opening game of USC’s inaugural 2012 season that a lacrosse game will be played at the Coliseum.
The Women of Troy started strongly in MPSF play, winning their first five conference games behind the offensive firepower of sophomore attacker/midfielder Caroline de Lyra, who leads the team with 35 points.
A pair of heartbreaking one-goal losses to Colorado and Denver, however, put the team’s chances of matching its 2013 fourth-place MPSF finish in jeopardy. Still, a win over Oregon or defending league champion Stanford would put USC in the MPSF tournament for the second straight year, an unexpected result for a two-year-old program.
Friday’s contest should pit Oregon’s high-flying offense against a more defensive-minded USC team.
The Ducks’ Shannon Propst has put up an otherworldly 60 points in just 13 games, while her teammate Carly O’Connell has notched 54. The pair should be a tough test for sophomore goalie Liz Schaeffer and the USC defense. Sophomore defender Courtney Tarleton, who leads the Women of Troy with 13 forced turnovers, will also need to be at her best.
Last year, USC defeated Oregon, 12-10, in Eugene, Ore.
Sunday’s game will be a matchup of similarly balanced playing styles.
Though the Cardinal’s Rachel Ozer is the team’s leading point-getter at only 32, the team features five other players with  more than 20 points.
De Lyra has also spread the wealth this season for USC. Three freshmen, attacker Annie Ruland and midfielders Alex Moore and Michaela Michael, have tallied more 20 points. The group will have to keep performing well to get past a Stanford defense that allows less than nine goals per game.
The Women of Troy face off against the Ducks at 4 p.m. on Friday, while Sunday’s matchup will begin at 1 p.m. and be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.
Sunday also marks USC’s Senior Day, where the team will honor Ceilidh Meagher and Elizabeth Eddy, the team’s only seniors. Meagher has appeared in five games and recorded one assist this season, while Eddy has played in 12 games and scored one goal.
Last year, Stanford topped USC, 17-12, in Palo Alto, Calif.
After this weekend, the Women of Troy will travel to the Midwest to finish off the regular season, a trip that will include the first ever lacrosse game played at Wrigley Field. The matchup will take place on April 26 and feature powerhouse Northwestern, the alma mater of USC head coach Lindsey Munday.

After facing a tough loss last Friday, USC’s baseball team bounced back to win the weekend series 2-1 against the Utah Utes. The Trojans’ pitching staff only gave up two runs in each of the three games, marking a significant improvement from previous series.

The Trojans gave the Utes a thorough beating on Sunday, winning the conference match 13-2 and achieving a season high of 19 hits. Seven different Trojans had multiple hits at the plate while four had multi-RBI outings. Sophomore shortstop Blake Lacey went 2-3 at the plate and drove in 4 RBIs.
The Trojans hope to extend their winning streak into this weekend’s series against Pac-12 rival Arizona at Dedeaux Field. The Wildcats currently hold a 17-20 overall record and a 6-9 Pac-12 record, the same conference record as the Trojans. Arizona holds the No. 8 spot in the Pac-12 standings while the Trojans occupy the No. 7 slot.
Senior starting catcher Jake Hernandez believes that the success from last weekend’s series win will positively impact the team’s mindset entering tonight’s game.
“We’re feeling pretty confident going into this weekend’s series,” Hernandez said. “We know what we have to do and what we have to accomplish to win big. It was really huge for us to take 2 of 3 from Utah in terms of confidence in our abilities.”
The Trojans did not have a game this past Tuesday, so the team has had more time to prepare and rest up before tonight’s matchup. USC has been concentrating on cleaning up their infield game as well as gaining better control of the batter’s box.
“This week in practice it was really all about focusing on staying on top of the ball at the plate,” Hernandez said. “We really need to work on creating more line drives instead of hitting pop-ups to avoid giving Arizona easy outs.”
USC faced a major slump in terms of hitting a few weeks ago, causing them to lose important games and entire series. The Trojans have recently turned it around, however, having multiple games with double-digit hits against Utah, Arizona State and Washington.
The Wildcats have also been hot at the plate recently, especially coming off of a hugely unexpected series win over No. 22 UCLA this past weekend, taking two of three wins from the reigning NCAA champions. Arizona’s total team batting average is .299 compared to USC’s .271. The Wildcats currently have four starters batting over .300, led by Scott Kingery, who brings a .390 average into tonight’s matchup.
Despite this, USC might have the advantage in pitching when assessing the numbers. The Wildcats currently have an unimpressive total team 4.93 ERA as opposed to the Trojans’ 3.75.
Ultimately, Hernandez feels that the team who plays the smartest baseball, both offensively and defensively, will win the series.
“To win this weekend, we’ve got to stick to what we do best, which is getting guys over and staying focused at the plate,” Hernandez said. “We need to concentrate on making better pitch selections as well as getting out there early for ground balls while out in the field. We’ve just gotta stay within ourselves.”
The Trojans will host the Wildcats at Dedeaux Field this weekend. Junior Wyatt Strahan will start for the Trojans in tonight’s match. The Villa Park, Calif. native will throw the first pitch at 7 p.m., which will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks, as will tomorrow and Saturday’s 7 p.m. games.

On Tuesday, as predicted by just about everyone, coach Steve Sarkisian named Cody Kessler as USC’s starting quarterback.
This news comes as no surprise to anyone who has watched spring ball this year (or read my column last week).
“He’s earned it and he deserves it,” Sarkisian said of Kessler.
Indeed, last season’s starter was visibly better than his chief competitor, redshirt freshman Max Browne. Kessler demonstrated not just a better understanding of a new playbook and an ability to make throws, but also a better innate feel for the game — adjusting to pressure, buying himself time in the pocket, quick decision making — obvious qualities that may not be as flashy as a cannon arm, but are equally important.
“Cody is very decisive right now,” Sarkisian said. “He knows where he’s going with the football. He’s got a great deal of confidence.”
This decision, Sarkisian stressed, reflects their play this spring and this spring alone. Kessler would start “if there was a game on Saturday.”
Here’s the thing though. There’s not a game on Saturday. Or the next Saturday or any Saturday after that for more than four months. Even the spring “game” this Saturday is going to be more practice-like than anything else, as the Trojans simply don’t have the numbers to complete a full scrimmage.
So Cody Kessler is the starter for now, and deservedly so, as Sarkisian said. He will be the singular voice leading the Trojans throughout summer workouts — a decidedly better situation than last year. But that does not at all guarantee that Kessler will start under center on Aug. 30 against Fresno State.
“When fall camp rolls around, [Max] is gonna come and swing away at [Cody] again and give Cody his best shot,” Sarkisian said. “And Cody will either respond like he’s done this spring, and continue to get better, or Max will pass him. That’s the beauty of being at USC and the beauty of competition.”
It’s not as though Browne played poorly this spring, by any stretch. Kessler simply played better than him, and that was plain for all to see.
“Cody and Max both know this competition is gonna wage on,” Sarkisian said. “Max isn’t just gonna go away, he’s gonna keep competing and keep working.”
Last year, both Kessler and former quarterback Max Wittek admitted to pressing too much as their battle to claim the starting spot dragged on two full games into the season — and after seeing the progress of Kessler throughout 2013, that is plenty obvious. This time around, Kessler was informed of his good news before practice on Tuesday. And according to Sark he responded with his best practice of the spring, probably due in part to having that weight lifted from his shoulders.
It is a good thing for USC that a starter, any starter, has been named. It gives the team a sense of direction and definitive leadership heading into the summer, when they are prohibited from interacting with coaches on the field.
Max Browne has all the tools. He will push Kessler in the fall, and more importantly, he will be given his fair shot to do so. But for now, Cody Kessler was the obvious choice. And it’s a good thing Sarkisian made it.

When will Max Brown transfer?
Fight on!
Let’s go SC!

Junior guard Byron Wesley, the Trojans’ leading scorer and rebounder last season, announced Wednesday on Twitter that he will graduate from USC this summer before transferring for his final season of basketball eligibility, sending shockwaves throughout the USC community.
Moving on · Junior guard Byron Wesley averaged 17.8 points per game and 6.4 rebounds per game last season while serving as USC’s captain. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
“First and foremost I would like to thank the Trojan family for all of the love and support they have given me these last three years. I’d also like to thank my coaches for helping me become a better player, my teammates for all of the great memories, & fans for the support,” Wesley said in a series of posts. “This was the opportunity of a lifetime & I couldnt [sic] be more thankful. I will be a Trojan for life & I’m most proud of that! Fight On Forever!”
After playing in all of USC’s games in his first two seasons — and starting all but one — Wesley was suspended for two games this February for a violation of team rules and was left out of the starting lineup for three other games. He averaged 17.8 points and 6.4 rebounds in head coach Andy Enfield’s first season at USC, which yielded just an 11-21 record, including a 2-16 mark in Pac-12 play and a first-round loss in the conference tournament.
The Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native also served as team captain and led the team in minutes per game, with 34.6. He scored a career-high-tying 31 points in the Trojans’ victory over Washington State in March.
Wesley’s announcement comes several weeks after freshman forward Roschon Prince declared his intention to transfer to Long Beach State. With Wesley and Prince gone and center Omar Oraby, guard J.T. Terrell and Pe’Shon Howard set to graduate in May, USC will enter next season without five out of its top seven scorers from the 2013-14 campaign.
“We wish Byron well and we thank him for his valuable contributions to our program,” said head coach Andy Enfield in a statement. “He had a very productive career here and I am sure he will do well wherever his career takes him.”
Before coming to USC, Wesley was rated the No. 1 player in California.
Wesley’s transfer also means that freshman guard Kahlil Dukes and sophomore guard Brendyn Taylor are the only USC high school players recruited by former coach Kevin O’Neill to not switch schools during their collegiate careers. O’Neill was fired in January of 2013, midway through Wesley’s sophomore year, and was replaced by interim head coach Bob Cantu.
Since Wesley is graduating a year early, he will be able to play immediately for whichever school he transfers to, per NCAA rules. Wesley’s departure also means that USC will have no seniors on its roster next season, barring any incoming transfers. Instead, the Trojans will have to rely on junior forward Strahinja Gavrilovic and junior guards Chass Bryan and Brendyn Taylor for veteran experience — even though the trio had just eight starts combined last season, and Bryan is a walk-on.
There’s a possibility that Wesley’s vacated scholarship could be given to Bryan, who provided speed and a steady hand off the bench last season while averaging 9.2 minutes and 1.6 points per game.
Sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt, who’s set to make his USC debut this fall after transferring from UNLV last year, tweeted, “I just wanna wish my brother @byron_wesley the best of luck in the rest of his career! Hate seeing u [sic] go bro but just know I support u [sic] 100%!”
It’s unknown where Wesley will transfer, although it seems likely he desires to go to a successful Division I program after suffering through 65 losses compared to just 31 wins during his USC career.
Wesley also expressed discontent with the Pac-12 conference when the organization released its list of honorees this season, leaving Wesley off completely. Wesley was the sixth-leading scorer in the conference and was 14th in rebounds per game.

Though it was just the regular season finale, Wednesday’s USC women’s water polo match had a NCAA tournament game type atmosphere surrounding it. The No. 3 Women of Troy (22-2, 5-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) squared off against visiting crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA (23-3, 5-1) in a crucial playoff-seeding matchup.
Super saver · Senior goalie Flora Bolonyai tied USC’s all-time saves record in the Women of Troy’s 6-4 loss to UCLA Wednesday night. The Hungarian’s 838 career saves earn her a share of Bernice Orwig’s record. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
As Senior Day ceremonies came to an end, the Women of Troy’s attitude drastically changed. All the smiles and cheering immediately ended, and it was all business beginning with the opening whistle.
Unlike many other games this season, offense was scarce for both teams. Physicality, however, was not. Capitalizing on an early USC penalty, the Bruins got on the scoreboard first as a skip shot found its way past senior goalie Flora Bolonyai. This did not deter the Cardinal and Gold, though, as junior two-meter Eike Daube sent a scorcher into the corner to net the score at one.
Daube, who entered the contest with 35 goals on the season, has collected 10 goals in the past three games.
Entering the second period, both defenses remained poised and in control. Following a tough foul by freshman driver Ioanna Haralabidis deep in the USC zone, UCLA was awarded a 5-meter penalty shot. Bolonyai, though, remained strong in the cage and tipped the rocket just wide.
With just over two minutes to play in the half, the Bruins ended the scoring drought, as a shot from the top of the formation bypassed the USC defense and sneaked in the bottom-left corner. Trailing once again, the Women of Troy responded as they had in the first quarter. While on a 6-on-5 powerplay, junior driver Monica Vavic drilled a shot across the cage to even the score heading into intermission.
“I was left open and I wasn’t afraid to shoot. I think that we were hesitating on our shot selection and that’s what ended up making us take shots we didn’t necessarily want,” said Vavic, USC’s No. 7 all-time leading scorer. “The shots that I missed were the ones that I hesitated and was not aggressive when shooting. The ones I made, I just went for it. I was confident and aggressive.”
Out of the break, the Women of Troy exhibited a stroke of brilliance on the offensive end. Just 20 seconds into the second half, senior driver Kelly Mendoza used positioning directly in front of the net to punch one through and give USC its first lead of the game, 3-2. This lead, however, would not last long.
Less than a minute later, the visiting Bruins responded with some luck. Exhibiting strong ball movement, a UCLA shot ricocheted off a USC defender, redirecting it into the goal to even the score, 3-3.
The Bruin’s scoring did not end there. With less than two minutes to play in the third period, a bounce shot skipped over Bolonyai’s head to pull UCLA ahead. Only a minute later, a scrum in front of the USC cage left the ball sitting alone. Kodi Hill scooped in another for the Bruins to end the period leading the Women of Troy, 5-3.
“[Playing from behind] takes us out of our confidence and you start second guessing yourself,” Vavic said. “We did comeback and tie it and go up by one. We just need to make defensive stops after we score.”
Trailing heading into the final period for just the second time this season, the Women of Troy did not back away.
Left alone up top, Vavic found the back of the net for the second time to pull USC within one. But the quick Bruin counter-attacks remained an issue. Only 30 seconds after Vavic’s deep shot, UCLA responded once again with a rip across the cage to increase their lead. The Bruins would hold onto the lead, finishing off the Women of Troy, 6-4, ending USC’s five-game home winning streak.
“You can take losses two ways: sometimes they can break a team or you can learn a lot and they can make you in the end,” said senior co-captain Kaleigh Gilchrist. “Hopefully we can learn a lot from this loss and keep improving into conference play.”
In the losing effort, Bolonyai registered 12 saves, tying her for most in program history.
USC will be back in action next weekend, as they host the MPSF conference tournament as the No. 3 seed behind Stanford and UCLA. The Women of Troy understand how to use this loss as fuel to return to their winning ways.
“We had a lot of great opportunities and we just need to finish them. It’s a tough loss, but it just fires you up to work hard,” Gilchrist said. “You got nine days until MPSF and the NCAA. We’ve got a lot to work on, but we’ve got time.”

Sunday, April 20, 4:20 p.m. Upright Citizens Brigade
Theatre Hollywood
Though the day is originally meant to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his crucifixion — which is some pretty heavy stuff — this year, Easter doubles as the day of celebration and consumption of cannabis. For those taking part in a little debauchery, this lineup will deliver more than a few giggles: a panel will discuss things you only discuss when in an altered state of mind and a group of comedians will re-enact favorite scenes from film and television. All of this is sprinkled with music, an appearance by Saturday Night Live veteran Jerry Minor and, of course, snack food.
THE AMAZING ACRO-CATS
Thursday, April 17 -Sunday, April 20
Mainstage at Santa Monica Playhouse
Finally an event that combines everyone’s two favorite things: cats and the circus. The Acro-Cats, a troupe of more than a dozen rescued and stray cats, will be performing their circus-themed routine this Thursday through Sunday at the Santa Monica Playhouse. This is the perfect event for cat lovers, circus acts or, strangely enough, rock music. The performance will end with a routine by the Rock Cats. The act will be led by Tuna, the cowbell-playing band leader, and features chicken Cluck Norris on percussion.
DOWNTOWN EASTERFEST
Sunday, April 20, 2 p.m.
Grand Hope Park
This all ages, free Easter event hosted by the New City Church of LA is sure to get you in the holiday spirit.

Will there ever come a day when being human is a personal choice?
Ghost in the machine · In Wally Pfister’s newest release Transcendence, Dr. Will Caster, played by Johnny Depp, discovers a way to upload his conscious mind into a computer that will carry on his work after he succumbs to an assassin’s radiation-laced bullet. – Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
In just a few short decades, the advent of digital technology has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with the world around us. Social media has connected us in ways that range from the wondrous to the unnerving. The online frontier has rewritten our laws — attempts to curtail online piracy have proven about as effective as the War on Drugs — and demolished cultural and geographic barriers with indelicate haste. We’re all global citizens now, baptized in a sea of infinite data — some of it useful, most of it prurient and superfluous.
As a society, we have proven ourselves more than willing to sacrifice our privacy for the ability to indulge any and every whim at the click of a mouse. But how much farther can we go? How much farther should we go?
The movement isn’t confined to the digital world, either. The fields of genetics, neuroscience, robotics and nanotechnology have also reported exponential advances in the last ten years. Many scientists believe humanity’s march of progress is actually a collision course with an event known as the singularity, a hypothetical point in time where a manmade artificial intelligence will surpass the combined cognitive abilities of the entire human race, resulting in a future dominated by immortal, omnipotent beings that will be essentially indistinguishable from gods. Wally Pfister’s twisty techno-thriller Transcendence envisions such a future while providing viewers with the marginal comfort that our future overlords will bear an uncanny resemblance to everyone’s favorite scruffy eccentric: Johnny Depp.
Transcendence centers around Dr. Will Caster, played by Depp, a renowned A.I. researcher who believes that humanity is destined to take responsibility for its own evolution. Along with his equally brilliant wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall from Iron Man 3) and his best friend and fellow scientist Max (Paul Bettany), Will — who seems very loosely based on real-life futurist Ray Kurzweil — is on the cusp of creating a sentient machine that can absorb the collective intelligence of our entire species while wielding the full spectrum of human emotion. Will’s controversial experiments have made him the target of numerous humanity-first extremist groups, and after an assassination attempt leaves him dying from radiation poisoning, he instructs Evelyn and Max to upload his conscious mind into his creation so he can experience “transcendence” for himself.
The procedure appears successful at first, but it wouldn’t be a Hollywood sci-fi movie without a few nasty complications. For starters, the new Will Caster doesn’t appear to share the original’s humanitarian sensibilities. In fact, the program’s primary goal seems to be the ruthless, relentless acquisition of knowledge, which it gathers at a frightening rate after Evelyn unwisely allows it access to the Internet. As the thing calling itself Will becomes increasingly megalomaniacal in its demands and objectives, Evelyn finds herself faced with a heartbreaking decision. Should she upload herself and embrace the inevitability of a post-human reality or force-quit the final vestige of the man she loves?
Transcendence marks the directorial debut of Pfister, the Oscar-winning cinematographer who has worked with Christopher Nolan on all of his films with the exceptions of 1998’s post-film school effort Following and the upcoming wormhole odyssey Interstellar. Their connection likely accounts for the pedigree of the movie’s supporting cast, including Nolan regulars Morgan Freeman as a fellow A.I. researcher named Tagger and Irish actor Cillian Murphy as Buchanan, the intrepid FBI agent assigned to track down Will’s murderers. Kate Mara, late of Netflix’s House of Cards and Josh Trank’s reportedly troubled Fantastic Four reboot, also appears as a beautiful but dangerous member of R.I.F.T., short for Revolutionary Independence From Technology, an anti-tech protest group who might have had a hand in plotting the assassination.
Newcomer Jack Paglen wrote the film’s script, which first gained the attention of Pfister and Nolan after it was featured in the 2012 survey of “The Black List,” a list of popular but unproduced screenplays published annually by development executive Franklin Leonard. The powers that be are evidently pleased with Paglen’s work, because the young scribe has already been tapped to write the sequel to Ridley Scott’s Prometheus, still tentatively titled Paradise, as well as a proposed follow-up to Blade Runner. The concept behind Transcendence isn’t exactly original; in fact it borrows rather liberally from everything from the Matrix and Terminator movies to an old episode of Batman Beyond called “Lost Soul” that dealt directly with the idea of mind-to-machine migration as a method of conquering death, but that doesn’t mean the film won’t prove popular, especially given Depp’s involvement and an opening weekend where the only major competing release will be the abysmal-looking horror comedy A Haunted House 2.
Another reason to support Transcendence is the fact that it represents Pfister and Nolan’s latest effort to advocate for the superiority of film stock over the cheap, murky digital cinematography favored by the vast majority of their industry peers: You see, the signs of the singularity are everywhere! Only a handful of movies are shot on film anymore, but the difference is often striking, particularly when viewed on IMAX screens. So at the risk of sounding like a Luddite (or an undercover R.I.F.T. operative), go see Transcendence and rage against the machine one more time before we merge with it forever.

When I lived at the Castle Chess Club in the Twin Cities in Minnesota, virtually nobody believed that a computer would ever beat the best human at chess.  Less than a decade later IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world chess champion.  Today, I can find hardly anyone who believes a robot will beat an average human at soccer by the end of the decade.  Or, how about a robot being as social as a human in ten years?  Humans typically underestimate the rate of computer progress, probably because it has never happened before, and it is hard to visualize exponential change.
You probably won’t believe this but a little over a decade from now, a desk top computer will have the computing power of a human brain (given that Moore’s Law is followed, which is a pretty safe bet, and may even be too conservative after some of the breakthroughs I’ve been following lately).  By 2040, a super computer will equal the processing power of all human brains combined!  The Singularity is coming – faster than you think.  What the Singularity will bring, who knows.  Imagine hundreds of monomaniacal AIs smarter than Einstein working on various problems that have bedeviled mankind like aging, faster than light travel, unlimited production, transmutation, etc.  We are on the cusp of creating a utopia.

Gandhi once said that, “the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” With that in mind, Professor Mark Marino’s WRIT 340: “Arts and Humanities” class has decided to expand their studies beyond the classroom and give back to the USC community through random acts of kindness.
The project, “SC Deeds,” is a service-oriented Facebook page on which students can post videos of their good deeds and nominate their friends to do the same. The program originated a few years ago when Marino, fondly known to his students as “Coach,” incorporated a service project into the curriculum as an exercise in personal growth and addressing issues in the surrounding community.
“There’s been a move among writing classes to incorporate service-learning,” Marino said. “I see it as a terrific opportunity to challenge the students’ critical thinking and creativity in addressing social needs locally and beyond USC’s borders.”
The focus of the entire class is “arts and humanities” and is designed to “explore the mediums and formats now allotted by technology and webspaces,” as student and business administration major Justin Nguyen described it.
“The class is very web-based and aims to create an impact on and through writing. With an online movement such as SC Deeds, we can positively impact our immediate community through video and text posts that serve as a conduit for positive change,” Marino said.
The class includes students in a wide variety of majors, from economics major Velvet Arriola to biology major Shannon Rindahl to communications major Berkeley Cavignac. Though the service project is not required, the students believe that it is a good opportunity to join something that should be a part of everyone’s life.
“The community service does help with personal growth,” Arriola said. “And being part of something that makes a difference can be really fulfilling.”
She’s not the only one in the class who feels that way.
“It’s just a good thing to do,” said Jimmy Quinones, a business administration major. “Writing is rarely an in-class activity so we are able to use some of our class time to try and make the world a better place.”
The class debated various ideas for what to do for their service project, including supporting veterans to volunteering for the American Heart Association, but when Tamara Flosse, a student majoring in environmental studies and business administration, suggested the concept for SC Deeds, they knew they had found the right one. Because the concept allows the community to get involved, the amount of service is unlimited and can possibly include the entire Trojan Family.
“My idea was that using Facebook friends’ nominations could start a trend at and around USC,” Flosse said. “God knows there are a lot of people in need around here. This is utilizing the simple fact that if a lot of people do a little we can get to considerable results. There would also be some sort of snowball effect, hopefully.”
The page has over 379 likes to date and about 24 videos uploaded since it debuted on March 31. Deeds that have been recorded so far include picking up trash on Figueroa Street, donating blood and leaving quarters on top of parking meters for the next driver. Some videos are short and to the point, others are funny and entertaining, but every deed shows how easy and rewarding it is to perform an act of service.
A favorite of Jordan Larsen’s involved an important problem.
“My favorite was the one where someone drove her friends home from a brunch where they had been drinking,” she said. “Drinking and driving is a serious pressing issue. This student saved her friends the cab fare and her actions promoted safe and responsible drinking and helped a friend out.”
Another video gave a little love to the security guards that stand on the corners to keep this USC community safe.
“My favorite involves helping out workers in the community with cold drinks on hot days or hot drinks on cold nights,” Quinones said. “Those guys have tough jobs so they need some love.”
The page requires very little to get involved. Most videos are less than a minute long, and doing a good deed and posting it is open to everyone.
“We are really hoping to reach as many people as possible, and so far it’s really been a matter of selecting the right people,” Flosse said. “It’s a little soon to tell, but so far I think SC Deeds has been doing pretty good considering we only have a presence on Facebook.”
The students believe a page like this is incredibly important in the hectic life of a college student, where it is incredibly easy to get caught up in daily life and forget to look out for the well-being of others. SC Deeds allows students to take a step back and think about others.
“Community service is important in anyone’s life because if you’re not giving back, then you’re just taking.” Quinones said. “The world would not be too fun to live in if everyone was just a taker.”
The class is hoping that their page will start a trend of good deeds that will motivate the USC community not only campus-wide, but in the surrounding community as well.
“We hope that the USC community and beyond will see this act as a noble effort to spread good deeds throughout campus,” Cavignac said. “By paying it forward in real life [and including] an online presence, we hope to make this go viral and keep the good deeds rolling.”

For Lauren McGoodwin, there’s no better feeling than helping others find satisfying careers.
Who run the world? · Lauren McGoodwin was inspired to build the Career Contessa website after focusing her Master’s thesis on millennials and career resources. – Photo courtesy of Lauren McGoodwin
“They don’t tell you this, but career happiness will matter for the rest of your life. It’s the place where you spend the majority of your time,” McGoodwin said.
McGoodwin is the founder of Career Contessa, a website dedicated to guiding and inspiring career-driven women who want to learn about how other career women got started in their careers and how they can effectively switch careers. Unlike traditional career websites that pump out articles every day such as “Here are the top 10 resumé tips,” or “Here’s what you should wear to an interview,” Career Contessa tries to offer important information from real-life experiences.
“Career Contessa is about real women with real stories who provide information that, in my opinion, simplifies the whole job search,” McGoodwin said.
Ever since she experienced what it was like to be at a job that wasn’t right for her, McGoodwin knew that someday she would help others in the same situation.
When McGoodwin started to work on her Master’s thesis for Annenberg’s Communication Managment, she decided to focus on millennial women and career resources. As a millennial herself, McGoodwin knew that this would be the perfect opportunity to speak on behalf of others about the gaps in career education and inspiration online.
“I wanted to dive deep into what career resources are out there in this area that really fit the millennial generation,” McGoodwin said.
As part of her thesis, McGoodwin prototyped a website with the research she had done. But throughout the process, she had the idea of turning this website into an actual resource, and began to create mockups for what would be Career Contessa.
“Ultimately, I decided that this was a resource that was really applicable … when you graduate and can’t figure out what it is you want to do, sometimes you feel a little hopeless,” McGoodwin said. “I don’t think millennials lack ambition, but we might have a problem with getting direction.”
In March 2012, McGoodwin finally realized that Career Contessa was something she wanted to focus more energy on. Between working as a full-time recruiter at Hulu and building Career Contessa from the ground up, McGoodwin had a lot on her plate. But after months of anticipation, the website launched in October 2013.
After starting this project on her own, she brought in two friends of hers, Mallory Benedict and Carrie Waller, who were just as passionate about the vision for Career Contessa as McGoodwin was. Rindi Zavodsky, who oversees special projects at Career Contessa, joined later on to help as well.
“It’s about the content we produce,” McGoodwin said.
So far, the website has more than 50 “contessas” that are featured, and each contessa has a blog post dedicated to her experiences as a career woman. Notable contessas that are included on the running list include Ramya Raghavan, head of politics and causes for Google+; Cynthia Samanian, product manager at Path; Alli Webb, founder of Drybar; and others.
“I think when you hear from real career women and their stories, that’s more helpful when it comes to thinking about jobs,” McGoodwin said.
What makes Career Contessa more personable than other career websites is that the articles make these powerful women into more than just the positions they hold — the articles bring out their personalities through vibrant photos in their workspace and fun facts that make all of these women relatable. The articles show readers that, even though these women already have great jobs, they all had to start somewhere.
“I know women coming out of college who are extremely bright and skilled and can do anything, but sometimes … you just need a starting point,” McGoodwin said.
As of right now, Career Contessa is solely focused on publishing quality content. Though the website has a “Jobs” page, there’s no special advantage if you apply from the website. But McGoodwin has plans to change that.
“We’re adding some new features that are going to be more actionable,” McGoodwin said. “We’re trying to make it so that when you go to Career Contessa, you’ll say, ‘I’m inspired to take action,’ and also, ‘I can take action on this website’ as well.”
On the other hand, to stand out as an applicant, McGoodwin has accrued a lot of knowledge on what other recruiters want to see, being a recruiter herself.
“A lot of times, I get calls and requests from people who are recent graduates who say I’m good at everything, I’m interested in everything and I really just want to work for Hulu,’” McGoodwin said. “You have to have some thought in the industry and the company … Become an expert.”
But down the line, be it wielding her expertise in recruitment or continuing to meet more inspirational career women, McGoodwin has many plans for Career Contessa.
“I really hope that in five years, Career Contessa will have become a well-known resource for people … whether they want to meet other like-minded career women or find jobs,” McGoodwin said. “In five years, I hope that we’ll be able to just help people connect and find career fulfillment and the job that they want.”

I read the Greek Life supplement in the April 15 edition of the Daily Trojan and appreciated the candor with which the writers were able to tackle some of the goings-on within the fraternity and sorority community. As a volunteer for a national fraternity, I spend much of my spare time mentoring Greek leaders and helping develop positive values-based leadership skills. One of the areas I spend time talking to students about is stereotypes within the fraternity and sorority community, and how such stereotypes impact the community. So I was surprised to see the assertion of one of the sorority members that negative portrayals of Greek members are “often based off false opinions from those outside of the Greek system, as well as media coverage that only highlights the negative.” If this is believed to be a problem, then how can it be solved?
Mr. Horton presented the answer to addressing the need to change perceptions about the Greek community: involve more non-affiliated members so they realize how good the community can be. As an insider, it’s often hard to imagine how people don’t know about the good things that fraternity and sorority members do for the community. But how many non-affiliated students are invited and involved in the chapter-based philanthropy events? Or participate in off-campus service events? People’s negative assumptions about Greek life change when they witness values-congruent behavior and negative assumptions are reinforced when they witness incongruent behaviors. If we truly want to change perceptions, then more events need to involve non-affiliated students. When I look around campus in 2014, it feels much the same as 1994, when only Greek members wore t-shirts for the various philanthropy events held throughout the year. Imagine the positive opinions formed if 10,000 more students attended these same events and then wore their pride on their sleeves?
We can’t ignore the very real negative behaviors that impact all of our chapters, regardless of council, that get highlighted in the media. I always tell students that it is not news when people live up to their values, it’s a basic expectation we have for our Greek community. If we want to change negative perceptions, then we need to recruit members who won’t engage in those behaviors. Then, the media will have to focus on something else. So until we present behaviors that can truly counteract false opinions, that honor the rituals of our organizations, we should care less about whether opinions are false or true and instead look to improve every organization that sports Greek letters. We all benefit from reinforcing values congruence and sharing these behaviors with all USC students.

On Wednesday, The New York Times published a scathing expose revealing glaring oversights in the investigation of rape allegations against Florida State quarterback and 2013 Heisman Trophy award winner Jameis Winston. The piece, written by Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Walt Bogdanich and posted online to The New York Times’ website, revealed that Tallahassee police did not take a DNA sample of Winston or even interview the Seminoles’ quarterback in their investigation of rape allegations.
Ethan Rechtschaffen | Daily Trojan
The difficulties of pursuing the case are clear: Winston admitted to having consensual sex with his accuser, but refused to speak with Florida State University officials or the police on the advice of his attorney, David Cornwell.
What’s troubling about this case is not the issue of whether or not Winston actually committed rape — it’s the simple fact that Winston had sexual intercourse with a woman who was clearly intoxicated and that woman had filed a police report, identified the perpetrator and the police prematurely closed the investigation without doing its due diligence.
At the time the report was filed, the woman alleged that she had “blacked out” at Potbelly’s, a Tallahassee bar where there were more than 30 video cameras installed. The amount of footage from Potbelly’s surveillance cameras that Tallahassee police requested to aid in the investigation of the rape charge: zero.
It’s no secret that football holds near-sacrosanct importance in the South. Jameis Winston was the phenomenally gifted football player who was taking the Seminoles to the promised land; his accuser, apparently too jumbled in her accusations to be taken seriously. The responsibility of the act of intercourse itself, however, is on Winston.
When Winston pursues a female with the intent of engaging in sexual intercourse, he opens himself up to the possibility that the female may withdraw consent at any time. It’s certainly understandable — in a sense that’s unnerving to almost everyone, the writer of this article included — that the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback may feel entitled to introduce himself to a woman with nothing but intercourse in mind. But the fact of the matter is that Winston’s accuser was clearly incapacitated by an excessive consumption of alcohol.
For a program to investigate such serious matters so lightly, despite the fact that intercourse occurred, is particularly disturbing. Florida State officials had every reason not to do their due diligence in the investigation of the accusations against Winston. They were riding a BCS National Title wave, coasting to national prominence with each improbable victory and lucrative marketing presence in a multi-billion dollar college football industry.
The city of Tallahassee had every reason to not investigate the star quarterback of their prized local football team. Effectively, by their lackadaisical show of effort in the carriage of justice, they have failed miserably as officials of their jurisdiction. The job of Tallahassee law enforcement is not to protect the fiscal interests of Florida State University football, and the job of Florida State University is not to protect its highly profitable athlete, but all of its students.
No single athlete, no matter how significant, should be considered above the law. The due diligence of a rape investigation is not solely for the sake of closure — its primary function is to bring criminals to justice and protect the interests of the constituency. Florida State University and the city of Tallahassee, in failing to do its due diligence in uncovering what exactly transpired that night between Winston and his accuser, is sending a message to its students and citizens: If you happen to be drunk, and then the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback of your football team has sex with you, it’s not worth looking too deeply into it while opening an investigation that could possibly hurt his performance.
This treatment of a victim of a crime as time-sensitive and delicate as rape is an absolutely appalling error in judgment, and Florida State University should be subject to a federal investigation. The state prosecutors were effectively at the mercy of a paltry set of evidence provided to them by a bungled police investigation in their efforts to prosecute Winston. But Winston was too instrumental in the Football Bowl Subdivision moneymaking machine, too quickly becoming a national darling, to be felled by such “shaky” allegations.
Those who saw video footage of Winston and his friends cheering the decision by the Florida state prosecutor’s announcement to not press charges will forever have that image indelibly marked in their minds. Here was a scholar-athlete sitting on top of the world, who was off the hook for a massive blunder he made one night in his off-campus apartment. Everyone in Tallahassee was rooting for Jameis Winston that fateful day — everyone except his accuser and the criminal justice system.

Joining a Greek organization was the best decision I have ever made.
Though I encourage candid discussion of Greek life, I have several criticisms of the articles published on April 15. First of all, I joined a sorority my freshman year because I saw the value that Greek life provides, not because I am “challenged” at finding a community on campus as the Daily Trojan implied. In fact, I am a part of many communities on campus in addition to Greek life. Secondly, as the financial manager for both my chapter and now the entire Panhellenic community, I can say with confidence that Greek life is not reserved for spoiled children that must “buy friends.” I have worked with many young women who pay for their own dues, and I myself live in the chapter house because it is far cheaper than living in any other off-campus housing. These “rich-kid” stereotypes are unfounded.
The defining benefit of Greek life for me is the leadership aspect, and the Daily Trojan did not emphasize this enough. Personally, I started as the Director of Finance for my chapter and now serve as Vice President of Finance of the Panhellenic Council. As an accounting major, these experiences have greatly defined my college experience. I have been able to hone relevant skills and refine my leadership abilities, all while making lasting friendships in the process. These opportunities have proven to be invaluable to my personal and academic development. Furthermore, I can speak to the leadership development within the chapters and in the community overall. You would be hard-reached to find a sorority or fraternity member who had not held some sort of leadership position at any point in their college career. Whatever you’re passionate about — event planning, philanthropy, finance or marketing — there’s a leadership outlet in Greek life that can help you pursue it.
This is not to say that the Greek community is perfect. We are flawed. We are, however, open to criticism and are not complacent. We brainstorm new solutions every single Panhellenic meeting. As stated in the Daily Trojan  article, “The ROW: More than stereotypes?,” relations with the university have faltered as of late. To combat this, the Panhellenic Council recently added a new position, Vice President of External Relations, for the sole purpose of cultivating relationships with administration and other organizations on campus. This and various other Greek actions (including the new Social Policy, the sexual assault panels and the increased values-based recruitment) prove that the Greek community strives for continuous improvement.
I love the recent openness about Greek life in the Daily Trojan, and many wonderful points have been addressed. But the conversation would be incomplete without a thorough recognition of the leadership benefits that Greek life can offer and a correction of false stereotypes. Even though the community is imperfect and has much to improve upon, I can wholeheartedly assert that joining a sorority was the best decision of my college career, and that it will continue to benefit me throughout my life.

When a rare lunar eclipse turned the moon crimson on Monday evening, the night sky appeared in a totally different way. The blood-red moon had not appeared for three years and reminded many watchers of the potential of the night sky to truly captivate with beauty.

Here on Earth, writing an opinion column usually starts with whatever headlines are making rounds on the national news. Has Congress done something silly today? Did they vote — or not vote — on a key piece of legislation? These things usually inspire my ramblings about domestic politics, so I was unsurprisingly at a loss for words (and ideas) when Congress adjourned for a two-week Easter recess last Friday. I found the motion of the celestial bodies to occupy just as much print space as the motion of our nation’s lawmakers.
Though the two-week Easter break for Congress is fiendishly long and likely undeserved, we as jealous readers and writers might take a less cynical approach. Given that Congress in session is nearly as productive as Congress out of session, this might seem strange, but I digress. Like the red moon, Congress’s two-week recess is an opportunity for the usual critics (myself included) to reflect on something else.
The bombing of the Boston Marathon last year was the largest attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. Three people died, and another 260 were injured. A memorial event Tuesday that was held ahead of the marathon next Monday brought survivors, friends, family, Bostonians and people of all different backgrounds together to remember and pay tribute to those who were injured or lost their lives, and those who took extraordinary actions under such traumatic circumstances.
One of those individuals was Carlos Arredondo, a modern American hero who rushed toward the blasts to offer any assistance he could to those whose limbs had been severed moments before. Arredondo and all of the first responders embody the spirit of compassion and heroism. They remind us that in our darkest hours, we are not without hope.
Come next week, many, especially the families of the injured and dead, will bitterly regret the actions of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Chechen brothers suspected of planning and executing the attacks. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother, awaits trial in November. Though Tsarnaev is accused of committing an unspeakable act of horror that permanently altered the lives of so many families, it’s a testament to the principles this nation was founded on that he is being given the due process he deserves. The trauma of 9/11 caused this nation to abandon many of those principles, but when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev takes the stand in a court of law in front of a jury of his peers in a few months, it will signify that this nation no longer diminishes our values in the wake of tragedy.
The significance of a lunar eclipse from an astrological perspective is that the lunar eclipse signifies a time of reflection: as the moon begins to wane, it marks a time to think back on previous events, namely ones that occurred during the time the moon was growing to become full. It is said that decisions and accomplishments that happen during this waning phase take on a special meaning for the future.
When Ronald Reagan was shot outside the Washington Hilton and rushed into surgery at George Washington University’s hospital, he looked at his surgeon and wryly remarked, “I hope you are a Republican.”
The surgeon didn’t blink, and calmly replied, “Today, Mr. President, we are all Republicans.”
This reflection on the Boston bombings and the heroes that emerged to help their fellow Bostonians might be my last bit of political positivism for a while, especially as the midterm elections season reaches full swing. Nevertheless, it is one that we should cherish, and one that will hopefully remind us that we are all Americans before we are Republicans or Democrats, especially as our hopeful candidates and already-elected officials begin to trash each other with attack ads. Next Monday, as thousands of runners and supporters take back the finish line that was ripped from them just one year ago, let’s put down the attack ads for a day, and remember that what binds us together is more important than that which sets us apart.
Like the red moon reminded its viewers that the night sky can be seen in a different light, the actions of everyday Americans immediately after the Boston bombings and to this day remind us of this potential for togetherness. At this particular point in the year, that is a nicer thought than 800 words on why Congress should take a shorter spring break.
