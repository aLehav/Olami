Naren Chitty, the founder of the Soft Power Advocacy and Research Centre at Macquarie University in Australia, visited USC on Monday to speak about the role of power and the importance of soft power in contemporary diplomacy.
Before founding the research center, Chitty, who has a doctoral degree in international relations from American University, spent time as a public diplomat in Washington, D.C. and currently teaches at Macquarie University. In addition to researching soft power and public diplomacy, Chitty also advocates the use of ethical soft power. In international relations, hard power is usually the use of military force. Soft power is distinct from hard power in that it is less concrete and stems from outside perceptions of a country’s behavior.
Throughout the presentation, Chitty discussed the definition and usage of soft power and elaborated on the ethical use of soft power. Combining his own personal experiences with academic theories, Chitty addressed how the use of ethical soft power can solve social and political problems on an international level.
According to Chitty, cooperation works as a positive feedback mechanism for soft power in that it strengthens soft power, which would in turn foster stronger international relationships. Soft power resulting from smart cooperation can be utilized to alleviate poverty, form strategic trade alliances and foster political freedom.
Though political scientist Joseph Nye formally defines soft power as “the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments,” Chitty set the mood of the presentation by reflecting upon the definition through a Confucian perspective.
“Never seek outcomes for others that you would not seek for yourself,” Chitty said. “That is my interpretation of what Confucius would have said if he was to be asked about what soft power was … Symbols of good governance include perfect good will, gentleness and benevolence to all righteous creatures.”
Though Confucianism is an ancient philosophy, Chitty gave modern interpretations of Confucian ideals that correspond with the concept of soft power. Based on Confucian philosophy, soft power requires that governments learn about the right form of governance within the broader value structure of their societies, espouse and promote such governance, become established with a recognized social position and share authority with other established figures.
“Buddhist culture … spread ideas of soft power during the last hundreds of years,” Chitty said explaining the role of Buddhism in the concept of soft power.
Included in Chitty’s presentation were also ideas regarding how soft power can be multiplied and applied to nurture international relationships. According to Chitty, reciprocation and cooperation are the tools involved in using soft power since the concept of ethical soft power focuses heavily on mutualism.
“In the case of current relationships between [the three countries] Australia, China and India, and [the countries] China, India and Nepal, cooperation to nurture a third party can result in three-way growth,” Chitty said.
Overall, audience response consisted of questions from students and faculty applying current and past diplomatic issues to Chitty’s ideas. Chitty’s talk promoted the use of soft power as an appealing, albeit complex, method of international diplomacy.

A new iPad and iPhone game app in development by a team of USC alumni aims to help users experience historical events in an interactive setting.
The game will be called Thralled and will allow users to take on the persona of a runaway African slave in 1700s Brazil. Gamers lead this protagonist, named Isaura, through multiple levels with the eventual goal of attaining freedom for the character.
The design lead, Miguel Oliveira, who graduated with a degree in interactive entertainment in 2013, believes that gaming is an effective way of engaging people with history. He hopes that his game will instill empathy for past slaves for those who play it.
“Interactive media has the potential to involve players in a more intimate way and create a sense of empathy that can only come from direct involvement,” Oliveira said. “It has the potential to explore a wider array of emotions, and most game developers ignore that.”
The gamer must successfully overcome obstacles while ensuring that Isaura’s baby does not get taken by shadow creatures. This is particularly challenging as the gamer must put down the baby in order to perform most basic actions. This aspect of the game is meant to recreate the constant fear a runaway slave would have experienced on his or her escape route to freedom.
Oliveira came up with the idea for Thralled as a solution to the lack of education about the history of slavery in his native Portugal.
“Portugal was the pioneer of the transatlantic slave route. What strikes me is that no one ever talked about it. I was not taught it in school. I don’t see it in any popular depictions of Portuguese history,” Oliveira said.
The game has stirred up controversy among some students, who felt that turning the history of slavery into an interactive game trivializes its importance.
“Media technology is not the way to educate young people about the history of the African-American experience. I find it hard to believe that this would ‘create empathy’ among players,” said Maya Richard-Craven, a sophomore majoring in creative writing.
“Maybe so, but faceless characters on a screen cannot connote the emotions, feelings and stories of real people –— a people that went 200 years without the right to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness,” Richard-Craven said.
Julia Wang, a senior majoring in neuroscience, had less of a problem with the use of slavery in the game than she did with the objective of the app.
“I think it’s super well intentioned, but the impotence falls upon the woman to free herself as opposed to the institution,” she said.
Others, however, believe that the game will be informative to people who might not understand what it means to be a slave.
“First-person playing gets as close as you can be. It’s the most realistic way to feel [like you’re in] another’s shoes,” said Zach Suite, a freshman majoring in interactive entertainment. “I definitely think it’s the best way to do it.”
After the completion of Thralled, Oliveira hopes to develop other games that allow people to interact with different periods of history.

On Monday morning, the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ School of International Relations hosted a conversation on international security and business in the Middle East.
Middle East expertise · James B. Smith, the former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, discusses U.S. security interests in the Middle East. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The panel featured Amer Kayani, Minister Counselor for Commercial Affairs for the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia; Janet Breslin-Smith, former professor at the U.S. National War College; and James B. Smith, U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
Kayani, who lives in Saudi Arabia and focuses on the Middle East’s economy as a part of his job, emphasized the parallels between economics within the Islamic religion and capitalism.
“Both [Islam and capitalism] permit private ownership of property, allow freedom of enterprise [and] support free markets in a competitive setting,” Kayani said.
Kayani noted that currently, governments in the Middle East have taken over these free markets and have been unable to keep up with the growing demand for jobs.
Anywhere from 50 to 70 percent of a Middle Eastern country’s population is 24 and under; this age group has recently graduated from college and is looking for jobs, which the government is unable to provide.
“Because state-owned enterprises have failed to create jobs, the leadership in these countries have come to realize that they need to open up the market … to allow small and medium-sized enterprises to come in and play an active role in job creation,” Kayani said.
Smith, who also lives in Saudi Arabia, noted the growing tension between ruling officials and upset citizens who cannot find jobs.
Smith noted that, for the first time in Saudi Arabian history, there are “self-forming groups of citizens” that can be seen coming together to help each other rather than relying on the government. He said one of the fears of ruling officials is that citizens will come together and form rebellions.
“The social contract in the region has always been one where the government provides and the population is thankful … but here we saw a different dynamic at work [in Jeddah November/December 2009],” Smith said.
Breslin-Smith, wife of Ambassador Smith and a USC alumna, talked about her experience living with Saudi Arabian women and learning what life “look[s] like from their point of view.”
Women in Saudi Arabia, though segregated from men due to Islamic tradition, are graduating at higher rates than men in the Middle East, and therefore are becoming a growing sector of the job market, said Breslin-Smith.
After college, approximately 70 percent of women are unemployed, and those that are employed tend to flock to online jobs they can do remotely, which allow them to remain segregated from men in their working environments.
From a business standpoint, Kayani noted that many industries are hiring only women workers, since women are unable to be seen in public during the day and therefore cannot take breaks to go outside, do not have obligations to take family members to appointments and are unable to drive during lunch breaks.
All three panelists agreed that the politics in the Middle East are “painfully slowly” changing as a result of unhappy populations who are becoming more educated and receiving less help from their governments.
Students found the panel to be  vibrant in its discussion of the Middle East.
“I thought it was very informative,” said Mina Rizk, a senior double majoring in Middle Eastern studies and political science. “[Smith] had a couple of good points that I myself didn’t agree with, but I’m sure he knows more than I do.”
Emily Kennedy, a sophomore majoring in international relations, found the discussion to be closely related to her studies.
“I was able to see the ideal application of my degree,” Kennelly said. “It was especially useful because it pertained to my concentrations, Middle East and women’s studies.”

Musical icon Sir Elton John captivated students Monday night at Bovard Auditorium with a performance of songs from his latest studio album in an international effort to promote music education.
Rocket man ·Iconic singer/songwriter Elton John, pictured at a prior performance, performed at USC’s Bovard Auditorium on Monday in an event sponsored by Visions and Voices and the USC Thornton School of Music. – Photo courtesy of Magic 107.5 FM
John’s performance came from a partnership with his label Capitol Records, USC Thornton School of Music and the Visions and Voices Arts and Humanities Initiative.
John’s visit to USC is one of his only two performances at a university, and the only one in the United States. John previously performed at his alma mater, the Royal Academy of Music.
Chris Sampson, the vice dean of the division of contemporary music at Thornton, said Capitol Records reached out to the university because it was a school of similar stature to the Royal Academy of Music.
Sampson said the experience of students seeing John perform and interact with him them directly was incredible.
“The value of his trip is hard to calculate,” Sampson said. “It’s immeasurable. Just to be able to see that level of professionalism is priceless. The opportunity to get insights and talk with such an iconic music figure is so rare.”
The show had three segments: performances of John’s songs from past albums, a question and answer portion and a debut of five songs from his newest album, The Diving Board, which is set to be released on Sept. 24.
When he addressed the audience, John used humor and personal anecdotes to promote his belief that music is a fluid and ever-evolving art form.
“My newest record is by a 66-year-old man and not a 26-year-old man singing ‘Rocket Man,’” John said. “It’s more mature.”
Though John’s latest album will be his 30th solo album, he stressed the said the work of young artists has had a huge impact on his career.
“There is a certain energy in this audience now: youth,” John said. “I pay tribute to the young. I have faith in the young and I love listening to new music.
Some students said that they gained a deeper insight into John’s artistic process by listening to him talk so frankly during the question and answer portion.
“It gave me an idea of what’s going on in his head and how you release an album at this point in his career,” said Mannat Kaur, a first year graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in global medicine. “I think it’s great that he’s receiving inspiration from newer artists and reinventing himself in his more mature album.”
In addition, John encouraged students to listen to every genre, ranging from gospel to hard rock. John said when he was younger growing up in the United Kingdom, American music was one of the greatest influences that led him to learn how to play the piano.
“Music has been a constant champion of life,” John said. “It’s been everywhere I have. From my lowest point to my highest point.”
John’s belief of supporting the younger artists despite cultural and musical differences translated into the organization of the show, which incorporated students from the Thornton School of Music. Sampson said during orientation over the summer, Thornton students from the Thornton Symphony and the Thornton Chamber Choir were asked if they would like to perform with John. The students were then selected based on which instruments were needed for the performance.
“Elton brought his complete band,” Sampson said, “but what they needed were choirs and members of our symphony to take that sound to the next level.”
In addition, students who filled the packed audience in Bovard felt the night was a meaningful experience.
“Being able to see anyone so influential to the music industry is necessary to a music student like myself to remind me to always pursue my studies and dreams in this field, and to always draw from all the music around me,” said Drew Mikuska, a sophomore majoring in music composition.
Some students, such as Alex Hoffman, a freshman majoring in film and television production, said that despite John’s long track record of successful idols, at the event they were able to see a rejuvenated artist.
“He’s inspired by younger artists and extremely open to development in music and conversation,” Hoffman said. “He doesn’t sound like someone bitter about getting older.”
Sampson said the next big name performer to come to USC will be the Beach Boys on Oct. 25 for Parent’s Weekend.

Today is the second anniversary of the Occupy Movement of 2011, and despite divided opinions on the protest, a little perspective on it seems warranted. It was a social justice movement that relied on grassroot movement. Fittingly, 99%: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film, the documentary on the protest, takes an equally collective approach.
Featuring interviews with the initial supporters, participants, documentarians, critics and a member of the “hacktivist” organization Anonymous, the film attempts to represent the different ideas and motives behind the movement and show its significance for today. Ultimately, though, in much the same way the actual movement’s message became cluttered and ambiguous, the documentary, too, suffers from the same problem.
It starts off with a montage of demonstrations similar to the Occupy protests that have occurred around the world. These demonstrations are tinged with a sense of irony though, as illustrated by the clips showing the promise of the Arab Spring of 2011. The film never gets around to actually reflecting on how other, more focused movements can result in unexpected, even disastrous outcomes though (Libya, Egypt and especially Syria).
Once the documentary moves to Zuccotti Park, the original location for Occupy Wall Street, the message of the film becomes a bit clearer, but only because the issues it brings up are something most people read in headlines during the protests.
It makes a point to show how the free market was systematically manipulated by the corporate infrastructure, that has created a class conflict that continues to grow today.
The documentary makes a point to show that the activists weren’t just protesting the big banks and their contribution to the market crash of 2008, but the fact that they have had record profits as the middle class struggles to get full-time jobs. It’s not just the student loan crisis, or the severe financial penalties placed on Americans struggling to keep up with their inflated rent. The film wants to show that America is in a very serious and important moment in history, and these are things that citizens have not only a right to know, but the right to to act upon it.
The severity of the issues that the Occupy Movement tried to bring to the forefront seems to only undermine the overall structure that the demonstration took. That’s not to say that it wasn’t commendable that the movement tried to take the approach that it did.
The documentary does a good job of showing that it wasn’t just a bunch of old hippies and delusional lazy liberals (it has a section bringing up the skepticism and bias that the major news channels had about the movement) but that it was a true collaboration stretching across several generations and professions. The sense of community is shown as the movement’s strength, but the film brings up that the lack of a hierarchy or true sense of organization made it difficult to get their point across.
Footage was taken from a multitude of filmmakers and participants — the film lists four directors and six co-directors and had contributions from nearly a hundred different collaborators — and through this we’re able to have a direct viewpoint of the first days in Zuccotti Park, the Brooklyn Bridge incident where more than 700 people were arrested, the infamous showdown at Occupy Oakland and the nationwide crackdown.
This idea of a decentralized documentary was perhaps appropriate to show for a decentralized social movement, but, it was unable to overcome the disjointed feeling of the myriad of voices it attempted to capture. The film has some powerful segments, even if it’s essentially preaching to the choir, but it doesn’t really bring anything new or revealing to the table. It doesn’t come to a direct consensus about what made the Occupy Movement different from the other movements happening across the world or what impact it had.
The most interesting tidbits of the film are the ones that don’t actually involve the Movement; it almost undermines itself by presenting how impaired they were by their own unclear message, in spite of the power of the issues they were trying to represent. It feels like 12 fascinating mini-documentaries smashed into one cluttered documentary.
It’s been nearly two years since the demonstrations waned, and we’re still left deciding what, if anything, they accomplished. It can be argued that the movement did bring this dialogue to the forefront, which is commendable, but certain segments of the film make the brutally honest point that bringing up the dialogue is not enough to deal with the issues. The recent election year certainly didn’t seem to be  influenced by Occupy Wall Street and, again, that point feels like a missed opportunity on the part of the filmmakers.
Though 99%: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film accurately captures the collective spirit of the movement, it fails to contribute a truly objective perspective. The film doesn’t present nearly enough context or suggestions about for dealing with the issues at home. It’ll certainly speak to people who deal with these issues, but it leaves the viewer with no resolution.

Let me start by saying this: Apple is not going under.
Even though Apple’s stocks are nearly half what they were worth just a year ago, let’s not forget that earlier this year, Apple disclosed that it currently has $137.1 billion in cash. That’s certainly not chump change.
But it’s still hard to think that all is well with the Cupertino-based company.
My loyalty to Apple was put to the ultimate test after the 2013 World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June.
I wasn’t there in person, but as I sat at my computer going back and forth between rapid-fire tweet and live stream, the mixed reactions that the keynote was generating were all too palpable.
The name that was revealed for Apple’s newest operating system, Mavericks, came completely out-of-the-blue. Mavericks, the name of a surf city in California, is the first of a new line of California-inspired OS names.
It seemed silly then, and though the name change came off as a joke, it was more likely done because 1) Apple had run through its list of OS cats and/or 2) Apple is desperately trying to be hip again.
The other, bigger update that was unveiled at WWDC, of course, was iOS 7. Joining the flat design bandwagon, designer Jony Ives introduced one of the most “unique” updates for iPhones yet. With its neon color palette and obnoxiously bold native apps, the announcement of iOS 7 was certainly unforgettable.
Not everything showcased during that keynote was terrible, of course. In fact, features such as tagging files within Mavericks OSX and a newly extended battery life among other updates were impressive. Let’s not forget the reveal of the sleek, cylindrical Mac Pro.
Fast forward to Sept. 10.
Tim Cook took the stage wearing a black collared shirt — a possible homage to the late Steve Jobs — and began with the usual Apple spiel. Numbers, accomplishments, more numbers. The first big announcement — the iPhone 5C — was nothing revolutionary, thanks to photos that had leaked weeks earlier.
Designed by — who else — Ives, the iPhone 5C is just as bright and colorful as the iOS 7 icons. These phones, made out of plastic instead of the usual glass and aluminum combo, will start at $99. Just because the iPhone 5C is cheaper, however, doesn’t mean that Apple had to make these phones look the part.
Later in the event, the iPhone 5S was introduced, coming in gold, silver and space gray — targeting what looks to be a completely different audience.
For a brief conference, the announcement of these two phones was a lot to take in. And though they’re different, and strange, in true Apple form, great specs were listed, including a brand new 64-bit processor for the iPhone 5S. And yes, Touch ID — Apple’s tech for fingerprint scanning, storing and deciphering — became official.
Despite my criticisms, it’s hard not to get giddy about these grand events Apple puts on. Even though Apple has been the butt of innovation jokes for a while now, Apple is still getting as much press as it did when Jobs was at the helm of the company. And though not all their products  are perfect, Apple always finds a way to wow people, be it through significantly improved features such as battery life or something as cool as Touch ID.
Apple’s original charm, however, has definitely started to vanish. Skeumorphism — i.e. mimicry in design, such as the game center’s green “velvet” background — on iOS 6 didn’t look too shabby. Yes, in a way it did look a bit old-fashioned, especially compared to Google +’s sexy flat interface. And yes, the pressure to innovate becomes even greater with each press and developer conference.
But instead of phones for the time being, why not focus again on its already successful innovations? To date, Apple has sold more than 200 million Macs. Why not think up a new laptop to introduce to the market? And even though all other Apple products have outsold Apple TVs, there’s a lot of untapped potential here as well, especially as we transition to the next generation of Internet television.
Though I’ve never been a die-hard fan, I miss the old Apple. I get that Apple is trying to reinvent itself. But every time I see something that’s so uncharacteristically Apple, such as colorful iPhones, I can’t help but wince a little.
Every now and then, I see bits and pieces of the Apple I used to know. The website, for instance, is as flawless as it’s ever been. One of the better examples of e-commerce, the Apple website combines simple and effective copy and pristine graphics to create an effortless user shopping experience.
Branding is still a strong point, too. Remember the Apple 1 computer that sold for nearly $400,000 at an auction? That’s the magic of Apple.
Innovation won’t get any easier from here on out. As markets start carving their own niches and as more and more phone companies get in on the profits, Apple will need to do all that it can if it wants to remain a leader in phones and computers.
As much as I’d like to recommend that Apple go back to basics and as much as I dislike some of the newer products that are coming out, halting innovation would not be a good idea. Apple has always been innovating, ever since the days when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak (and Ronald Wayne, to some extent) started toiling away in Jobs’ garage.
So continue innovating, Apple. Some kinks still need to be worked out, but a much-needed winner is on the way.
Just don’t expect me to switch over to iOS 7 any time soon.

I’d have to disagree with you on your claim that colorful iPhones are not reminiscent of the “old Apple.” iMac, the computer that began the Apple wave of the last decade or more started with a number of different colors. In fact, Apple’s logo was a rainbow-filled version of the current logo until 1998 (when the iMac was first introduced in multiple colors). I would venture to say, instead, that the “new Apple” came to be in the early 2000s, and this new colorful iPhone harkens back to the “old Apple.”

Fond memories of classic Southern comfort food, inspired by Chef Dave Northrup’s childhood, stirred the opening of his new restaurant, Roadside Eats, a southern styled sandwich shop located on Sunset and Vine in Hollywood.
Fried green tomatoes · The BLT at Roadside Eats can be ordered with tofu substituted for the bacon (pictured above). The restaurant offers various vegetarian-friendly options in addition to its heartier fare. – Alegra Hueso | Daily Trojan
Conveniently located a swift 25 minutes away from the USC campus, just off the 101 freeway, Northrup’s vision presents Southern comfort food with a twist, serving healthier versions of the calorie-laden fare he grew up with for his fast-casual Roadside Eats. The cavernous, vintage meets sleek stainless steel counters of the 2,000 square-foot dining area fits with the fast-paced southern meets Southern Californian gastronomy that Roadside embodies.
The unique blend of the two cultures, is one of the main details that sets Roadside Eats apart from any other southern styled sandwich shop. Not only is every delectable ingredient between the buns made in-house, with fixings to accompany Roadside sandwiches and salads ranging from stick-to-your-ribs Baked Beans with Trimmings to creamy or vinegar-based Coleslaw, but whatever the customer wishes can be ordered sans bread, or “Greens-Style,” turning any sandwich into healthy salad with a house-made vinaigrette or buttermilk ranch dressing on the side.
To add to the Californian effect, not only can items on the menu be turned “Greens-style” but a variety of vegan options are offered as well. The Fried Green Tomatoes BLT is a tasty example. Normally served with crispy smoked bacon, the Fried Green Tomatoes BLT sandwich can replace the bacon with succulent smoked tofu, with fresh lettuce, crisp fried green tomatoes and zesty tobasco aioli all between two hearty slices of buttery Texas toast. It’s simple but mind-bendingly good and comes highly recommended by the servers.
The prominent glass deli case in the front of the eatery is filled with good-looking, garden-fresh vegan and vegetarian options with picnic-style sides and salads, a selection that rotates with the season and will feature options such as the fresh, summer-tasting Watermelon and Edamame salad, and perfect for fall, the Baby Kale and Roasted Butternut Squash.
Other tasty sandwich options include the Griddled Patty Melt, which is infused with pimiento cheese, sweet grilled onions and freshly sliced tomato, and the crunchy and unique, Pecan Fried Chicken, served with sliced tomato, lettuce and sweet maple mustard. Salads include Nana’s Potato Salad, a traditional mayo-based potato salad with pickles and chopped celery and it’s humorous SoCal counterpart, Not Your Nana’s Potato Salad with roasted fingerling potatoes, tangy capers, lemon and fennel. There’s also Summer Succotash, Field Peas and Summer Tomato that has black-eyed peas, unique pimento and oregano relish with sweet bite-sized tomatoes. Available sides include crispy French fries (plain or spicy), classic baked beans, and creamy or vinegar-based coleslaw. Sandwiches and salads can be personalized with such add-ons as fried egg, thick cut bacon, pickled red onions or spicy chow chow, a Southern relish made with jalapeños, bell peppers, onions and green cabbage, but be forewarned, the add-ons can get a little pricey.
Roadside Eats is capable of delivering strong flavors and unique takes on classic dishes, such as the Cajun-Glazed Shrimp Po’ Boy, made with sweet and crispy shrimp, with sliced tomato, lettuce and red onion, but occasionally Roadside’s meat dishes are produced drier than anticipated. For instance, the Texas Cheesesteak has the reputation to be a savory, mouthwatering sandwich with melted white cheddar, sweet roasted peppers, smoked onions and spicy chow chow, but tastes better with the homemade Steer Sauce and or the homemade BBQ sauce. Such an addition can spark the taste buds of any hungry customer, but most likely won’t make the patron want to order the formerly popular dish again.
In the dessert department, Roadside Eats offers up some bite-sized, sugary fried pies in three classic southern flavors of cherry, apple or peach — with or without a cup of soft-serve ice cream on the side. Though the pies are very sugary, sweet and delicious, they won’t spark the fancy of any customer with a large sweet tooth. Still, they make for a great mini snack.
A fusion of two cultures is a clever way for entrepreneurs and chefs to create a profit in a culturally diverse environment. Memorable flavors, large portions, creative combinations and average prices, are a convincing way to bring back customers and of course, a dash of great BBQ sauce doesn’t hurt, either.

A Noise Within kicked off its 2013-2014 repertory season Saturday with a play about a great leader searching for meaning and justice in the Middle East. No, this is not the dramatized version of President Barack Obama’s dealings with Syria; this is Pericles, Prince of Tyre, one of Shakespeare’s most epic works.

Pericles follows the life of a young prince in pursuit of a wife. After a series of mishaps, he falls in love with a virtuous princess, they marry and all is well. When his wife dies in childbirth, however, his entire life quickly falls to pieces. But since this is a Shakespearean comedy, the ending provides a happy resolution and, of course, a wedding.
For theatergoers in the early 17th century, when this play was first produced, seeing the story of Pericles would have produced the same exhilaration that summer popcorn flicks like Pacific Rim inspire today. Pericles is a Jacobean summer blockbuster complete with sweeping romance, heartbreak, incest, mystical healing, goddesses, prostitutes, hit men, pirates, two shipwrecks — two! — and lots of jousting.
“All this in one play?” one might ask. “But, how?”
Well, it’s a strain. Successfully weaving together scenes in disparate locations and meandering thematic elements was a task the Bard himself struggled with. Some scholars even posit that Shakespeare only wrote approximately half of Pericles, collaborating with another (apparently inferior) playwright on the first several scenes. Between the awkward 14-year time jump that occurs in the middle of the play and the seemingly haphazard scene order, it’s damn near impossible to keep this play from feeling disjointed.
The creative team behind this production of Pericles, however, pretty much pulls it off. They achieve a sense of cohesion through two brilliant directorial choices. The first is the casting of powerhouse A Noise Within regular, Deborah Strang (who absolutely carried last season’s stunning production of The Grapes of Wrath as Ma Joad) as the story’s narrator, Gower. Strang shoulders the role of storyteller with darkly comedic panache, trudging around the theater like a gothic Mary Poppins with a suitcase full of severed heads. Gower’s exposition-heavy monologues are helpfully pantomimed by a troupe of creepy white-clad ballerina/clown/mimes who wear signs with character names and end up providing the audience with a sort of roadmap to each scene. The consistency established by Strang’s Gower is compounded by the significant use of double-casting. Using the same actor to play two different roles can be obnoxious or confusing if executed poorly, but when done well, as in the case of Pericles, double-casting can provoke metaphorical analysis of character relationships. Jason Dechert, for example, portrays both the regal young Pericles and the Russell Brand-esque pimp who buys Pericles’ daughter, Marina, thereby shedding light on the variety of paternal figures in her life. Similarly, Jules Willcox portrays Thaisa, Pericles’ wife, for the first half of the play before returning as Marina for the play’s duration, highlighting the notion that Marina is nearly identical to her mother in both appearance and demeanor, but also raising some questions about the quasi-romantic bond between this father and daughter pair.
In addition to killer performances by the aforementioned actors — it is no small feat to switch between character mindsets mid-play — the bizarre ballerina/clown/mime ensemble provides gorgeous movement and dance that saves this production from falling into the cut-and-dry tedium of some productions of Shakespeare. They stole the show a handful of times, especially during the sex scene, which would be uncomfortable if it weren’t so beautifully performed, and the somehow hilarious “horse dance” during the jousting tournament scene.
As is always the case with A Noise Within productions, every technical aspect of the play was of top-notch quality. The impressive set consisted of a looming wall of whitewashed doors, drawers and cabinets snugly fit together Tetris-style, with opening panels to create multilevel picture windows for ensemble members to appear. The rich jewel tones of the elaborate costumes stood in intriguing contrast to the light backdrop and similarly bright lighting scheme, making for some arresting stage pictures. The sound design was near perfect, aside from a brief lapse into a melodramatic string ballad during the tearful reunion of Pericles’ family.
Pericles marks the first installment of A Noise Within’s season that focuses on the theme of “Lost & Found.” The rest of the season promises to be at least as excellent as Pericles, including Molnar’s The Guardsman, Samuel Beckett’s Endgame, A Christmas Carol, Tartuffe by Moliere, Macbeth and William Inge’s Come Back, Little Sheba. Though the journey all the way to East Pasadena can be lengthy, the superior quality productions at A Noise Within are always worth the trek.
With the first day of autumn fast approaching, indulge in one last dose of summer blockbuster-style fun while still feeling high-brow with Shakespeare’s Pericles.

On Saturday, former USC outfielder Nick “Chili” Buss became the 109th former Trojan player ever to reach the pinnacle of baseball and earn a promotion to the major leagues.
Buss earned his call-up with the local Los Angeles Dodgers after having an extremely impressive season for the Triple-A affiliate the Albuquerque Isotopes. He appeared in Saturday’s game against the San Francisco Giants as a pinch-hitter for left fielder Carl Crawford in the bottom of the third inning, and his first at-bat resulted in a flyout to center.
The Michigan native remained in the game and notched his first major league hit in the bottom of the fifth inning, singling to right field.
The Trojan alumnus followed that performance up by making the first start of his career on Sunday, going 1-for-4 in a tough 4-3 loss for the Dodgers against their bitter rivals.
Buss was drafted by the Dodgers in the 35th round of the 2006 MLB draft out of San Diego Mesa College but chose instead to play at USC. Two years later, the move paid off, as he was drafted in the eighth round by the Dodgers in 2008, earning himself a heftier signing bonus and improving his chances of making it to the show.
During his time at USC, the left-hander played in 110 games and had a .293 career batting average. He then entered the Dodgers farm system and played five years there before finally earning his major league chance.
His performance with the Isotopes was particularly impressive, as he batted .303 with 17 home runs and 100 RBI in 131 games, which garnered a selection as a member of the Pacific Coast League All-Star team.
“It was very exciting. But surprisingly I felt calm,” Buss told the Los Angeles Times after his debut. “You get so used to stepping into the batter’s box. It was probably a little more nerve-wracking on deck than it is once you step in there. It’s just back to business as usual.”
Buss becomes the second Trojan to be called up to the majors this season, following current Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim second baseman Grant Green, who earned his shot earlier in the summer with the Oakland Athletics before being traded to the Angels in July. Green and Buss were teammates for two years in 2007 and 2008.
Buss’ call-up makes him the ninth Trojan currently playing in the majors, an impressive feat for USC, considered to be one of the premier baseball programs in the nation.

Don’t believe everything you read. At least, that’s how the saying goes.
Because if you read statistics about USC’s defense in 2013, you would believe that the Trojans had one of the top defensive units in all of college football.
So far this season, USC ranks eighth in the nation in points per game allowed at 10.0. The team is second in the NCAA in rushing yards allowed per game (43.7), fourth in total yards allowed per game (212.3), second in sacks (12.0) and sixth in interceptions, which is particularly encouraging given the amount of uncertainty surrounding the Trojans’ secondary entering this season.
But remember: don’t believe everything you read. Numbers might never lie, but they don’t always tell the whole truth.
Hawai’i, Washington State and Boston College, the three opponents USC has faced this season, all finished 2012 ranked 102nd or worse in scoring offense, and only the Cougars finished higher than 100th last season in total offense (96th). So, no, as impressive as USC’s defense has been, it hasn’t really seen a formidable opponent yet in 2013.
All of that will change Saturday when Utah State comes to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Last season, the Aggies, playing in the now-defunct Western Athletic Conference, which is a non-BCS automatic qualifying conference, ranked 21st in the country in total offense and 26th in scoring offense en route to an 11-2 record and a respectable No. 16 spot in the final rankings of the Associated Press poll.
This season, the results have been even more staggering, though they should be taken with an enormous grain of salt. Utah State is eighth in scoring offense and 12th in total offense, but those numbers are bolstered by wins against overmatched Air Force and FCS Weber State. Utah State’s lone loss this year came against the Pac-12’s Utah, but the team still racked up 487 yards of total offense.
But the reason Utah State poses such a threat to the stout USC defense is mostly because of one player: junior quarterback Chuckie Keeton. At 6-foot-2 and 200 lbs., he’s physically imposing and a dangerous open-field runner. He leads the Aggies in rushing yards this season and has more than 1,000 yards rushing for his career. He ranks ninth in the nation in passer rating this season, and finished 17th in that category in 2012.
USC fans most likely shudder at the thought of going up against a dual-threat quarterback, and rightfully so. The list of running gunslingers that have burned Trojan defenses in the past decade is an impressive one: Texas’ Vince Young in 2006, Washington’s Jake Locker in 2010, Arizona’s Matt Scott in 2012 and every Oregon quarterback from 2007 onward: Dennis Dixon, Jeremiah Masoli, Darron Thomas and current Ducks signal-caller Marcus Mariota.
Making matters worse for USC is Keeton’s penchant for rising to the occasion against the big boys of the BCS. In his four career games against BCS automatic qualifying teams, Keeton has completed 67.6 percent of his passes for 924 yards, thrown six touchdowns and no interceptions and rushed for 279 yards on 55 carries (5.1 yards per rush) and three touchdowns. Simply put, Keeton shows up ready to play against higher competition.
Utah State’s offensive proficiency can be directly attributed to Keeton’s arrival. In 2010, the year before Keeton’s freshman campaign, the Aggies averaged 22 points per game and amassed 4,168 yards of total offense. In 2011 and 2012, they averaged 33.6 and 34.9 points per game, respectively, and had nearly 6,000 yards of total offense each season.
The purpose of all these gaudy statistics is to show that USC’s defense will finally face a worthy adversary this Saturday. Coming into the season, questions surrounded the Trojans’ defense: How would Pendergast’s new scheme work? Would the secondary improve? Could the team still pressure the quarterback with only three down linemen?
Those questions have, for the most part, been answered. But now the main question that remain remains is simple — is this for real?
We’ll find out on Saturday. If the USC defense can stymie a gifted quarterback the likes of which it has consistently struggled with time in and time out in recent years, then I’ll go all in on this Trojan defense. If the defense can force some turnovers and keep Keeton and Co. out of the end zone, then you can call me a believer.
Until then, color me skeptical.

Following a much-needed 35-7 win against Boston College last Saturday, the Trojans now set their sights on the Utah State Aggies (2-1), who are coming off of a 70-6 bashing of FCS school Weber State.
Rave reviews · Just three games into his career, freshman running back Justin Davis has impressed with 172 rushing yards and two touchdowns. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Impressive improvement
After combining for a mere 136 passing yards in his first two games, redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler impressed against the Eagles, completing 15 of 17 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns.
Earlier in the season, many argued that either Kessler or redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek would play better if given the jolt of confidence of being named the starter, and Kessler’s play on Saturday indicated that might have been the case. In his first game after being named the official starter, Kessler led the offense with ease and finally highlighted the talents of star junior wide receiver Marqise Lee. The pair connected for an 80-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter.
“The one area that was so broken the week before in our team seemed to get fixed,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “We’ll just continue to improve.”
Keeping up with Keeton
Unlike the Trojans’ shaky offensive start, the Aggies have experienced smooth sailing, boasting the eighth-highest scoring offense in the nation behind junior quarterback Chuckie Keeton.
In three games this season, Keeton has completed 78.1 percent of his passes, good for an average of 307.7 yards per game. He also leads the team in rushing, with 62.3 yards per game, and has thrown 12 touchdowns. Last year, Keeton set single-season records for Utah State in touchdown passes, completions, completion percentage, passing yards and total offense.
Kiffin admits that Keeton is the biggest threat the Trojans have yet to face this season.
“[Keeton is] a running quarterback who can throw the ball, who can scramble, who can do everything,” Kiffin said. “These guys have lit up the scoreboard for years.”
Indeed, the Aggies have posted 70 and 52 points in their last two wins, and Keeton has arguably established a spot in the Heisman race, with help from Utah State’s athletic department, who have popularized the hashtag #Chuckie4Heisman.
The clash between the Aggies’ eighth-best scoring offense and the Trojans’ eighth-best scoring defense is sure to impress.
Run along
Prior to the start of the season, Kiffin’s depth charts were a source of confusion for most, with most positions seemingly having co-starters. Now, three weeks into the season, he seems to have finally straightened things out, most notably at the running back position.
After three consecutive 100-yard games to open the season, a feat not accomplished by a Trojan since Heisman trophy winner Marcus Allen did it in 1981, redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden has been named the official starter at the running back position.
In the loss against Washington State, Madden carried the ball 32 times and was admittedly banged up afterward. The pressure on him was alleviated against Boston College with the help of freshman tailback Justin Davis, who rushed for 96 yards against the Eagles. Davis is now listed as the second stringer and has been the biggest contributor of USC’s crop of freshmen, followed by safety Su’a Cravens.
“We’ve got a number of guys — inexperienced guys — that now are playing for us, doing well, and we want to take them to the next level,” Kiffin said.
Senior tailback Silas Redd was left off the most recent depth chart and hasn’t been fully participating in practice, as he is still recovering from last spring’s knee surgery. Though he has been unable to contribute on the field, the success of the younger running backs has been partially attributed to his leadership.
“[Redd] has been helping us all out,” Davis said. “He’s been helping tremendously. I was a little flustered when I got here in the spring, and he took me aside and calmed me down a little bit. He’s been that guy for me and he’s helped me along this path.”

The first thing people mention is his offense.
And how can they not?
Piecing together · Men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield has injected life into the Trojans’ floundering basketball program, most notably with the commitment of five-start point guard recruit Jordan McLaughlin. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Florida Gulf Coast University’s high-octane, up-tempo style of play captivated the nation last spring, as their impromptu Sweet 16 berth — by way of defeating powerhouses Georgetown and San Diego State, no less — validated the distant notion that successful college basketball teams can still be exciting.
Mere weeks after Florida Gulf Coast was eliminated, Enfield was hired by USC Athletic Director Pat Haden in April to bring that excitement to a basketball program that had inspired little enthusiasm in the Trojan faithful.
But while his system’s dunks and 3-pointers garnered most of the attention, USC men’s basketball coach Andy Enfield is also enamored with how to ensure Player X is open for that lob attempt in transition, and how to put Player Y in an optimal position to break down the defense and kick out to a teammate.
For Enfield, results matter, of course — what coach doesn’t love winning? But it’s the process and journey to the result that’s most important.
Enfield has cultivated a nuanced approach to developing his players’ skills, which stems from his experience in the mid-to-late ’90s as a shooting coach with the Milwaukee Bucks and an assistant coach with the Boston Celtics.
“There are a lot of different breakdown drills we do,” Enfield told the Daily Trojan in late August. “We just emphasize it, and we work on it and we teach. I don’t allow players to go through practice doing it the wrong way.”
If Enfield sees a player shooting with improper form, or executing a play the wrong way, he’ll immediately stop practice and correct the mistake. It’s a meticulous habit, but also a significant reason why Enfield’s players execute his game plan so effectively.
“Repetition without teaching only gets you to a certain level,” Enfield said.
To get to the next level and ultimately compete for Pac-12 championships, Final Four berths and a national championship, the Trojans have to first learn Enfield’s offensive system — a challenge given the stark contrast between FGCU’s roster last season and USC’s this season.
“We’re going to play a similar system,” Enfield said. “When I say similar, it’s going to be the same concept. We’ll adjust some of our playcalling and some of our screening action to use our strengths.”
Those strengths include 7-foot-2, 270 lb. center Omar Oraby and 7-foot, 250 lb. center           D.J. Haley (a transfer from Virginia Commonwealth University). While neither player is the prototypical Enfield big man — his rotation at FGCU featured athletic, spry players 6-foot-9 and below — Enfield welcomes the challenge of handling more traditional, back-to-the-basket big men.
For the second straight season, few teams boast as monstrous of a frontcourt as the Trojans, and Enfield plans to use that to his advantage.
“I’d be crazy not to get those guys the ball in the paint because they’re very good,” Enfield said. “They have great hands and good footwork. But they can still set ball screens.”
And that’s where the famed “Dunk City” highlights could come in.
“We run a 4-out, 1-in motion, where they can still set ball screens and run to the rim for lobs, dunks or bounce passes,” Enfield said.
Despite the relative youth of the roster, Enfield feels another strength of the Trojans will be the experience of their key players.
Returners Oraby, guard J.T. Terrell and guard Byron Wesley figure to start and assume significant leadership roles considering their familiarity with the program. Transfers Haley and point guard Pe’Shon Howard (Maryland) also bring experience from established programs.
The biggest unknown is the group of freshmen — guards Kahlil Dukes and Julian Jacobs, and forwards Nikola Jovanovic and Roschon Prince — four players who will likely tilt USC’s season one way or another.
“We’re going to need the four freshmen to contribute,” Enfield said. “It’ll be interesting to see how they adjust to the college game, how much they improve and when they’re thrown into the game situations starting in November, how they perform.”
With so many fresh pieces, including a newly assembled coaching staff and potentially six untested rotational cogs, Enfield has refrained from setting goals for the upcoming season. Instead, he plans on letting his players decide their own expectations once official practices begin on Sept. 27.
“I think if you set your goals too high or too unrealistic, I don’t think it helps you achieve [them] or stay focused throughout the season,” Enfield said.
“But I’m a big believer of if your goals are not necessarily the end result, but how you’re going to get to a certain result, I think those [goals] are much more attainable because you have control over how hard you work on a daily or weekly basis.”
That doesn’t mean Enfield lacks a long-term vision, though. Atop his list: creating a program with “sustainability at the national level” and being “a top-25 team every year.”
Which is exactly what he was hired to do back in April.
When USC Athletic Director Pat Haden spoke of Enfield at his introductory press conference, Haden emphasized the importance of USC basketball establishing relevancy for the first time.
Five months into the job, Enfield’s tenure is off to a promising start.
Five-star point guard Jordan McLaughlin committed to the Trojans on Wednesday, bypassing opportunities to play at UCLA, Kansas and Indiana. The move signifies a major coup for the Trojans in the local and national recruiting scene, and is a sign that Enfield’s transformation of the basketball program has already begun.
“I don’t know what people think outside our program, but I’ve been very impressed with our players as individuals and as a team, and the atmosphere our coaching staff has created around here and the Galen Center,” Enfield said. “It’s a pretty exciting time.”

Recently, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services announced its plans to launch a blood test for lead poisoning to settle outrage and fear over the toxicity of a local Vernon car battery recycler, one of the largest facilities of its kind west of the Mississippi. Plant operator and Georgia-based battery maker Exide Technologies will pay for the tests. Though this seems to be a step in the right direction, the tests will not be effective in serving the public properly. A scientific study is necessary.
For a plant that has been around for 30 years recycling 22 million lead-acid automotive batteries annually, the events of the past year point downhill. According to the Los Angeles Business Journal, California regulators ordered a temporary shutdown of the plant earlier this year on April 24.
They were prompted by a report issued by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which had found that the plant was emitting a hazardous level of arsenic and carcinogens in the air, threatening 100,000 nearby residents. Subsequently, the Department of Toxic Substance Control conducted an investigation that found hazardous levels of toxic metal in water discharges from facility pipes. The contamination of the soil and underground water supplies are still being determined.
In June, however, Exide won the right to reopen in Los Angeles. County Superior Court’s Judge Luis Lavin stated that the public would not suffer by allowing the lead recycler to gain more business. But a proper investigation would provide the hard statistics and evidence needed to properly assess the plant’s safety.
Exide’s plant in Frisco, Texas had stirred a lot of concern among residents as well. Blood testing for lead exposure near the plant had also been offered to residents, but the data reported said that of the 608 samples analyzed, 575 did not contain detectable levels of lead. Yet, upon closer examination, the tests done in Frisco have so many flaws that could possibly be repeated in the Los Angeles plan.
Dr. Cyrus Rangan, the director of the county public health’s bureau of toxicology, told the Los Angeles Times that he expects to find nothing out of the ordinary for the L.A. tests because there are not many “people with a lot of symptoms of lead poisoning.”
But that’s exactly the concern. Leading poison, according to Mayo Clinic, is difficult to detect; there are no symptoms until levels become hazardous, or in other words, it’s too late. Thus, a one-time testing project will not show the true nature of the situation. Moreover, though treatment of lead poisoning removes the metal from bloodstream, traces of it remain in the bones, sometimes causing cancer and neurological damage. The effectiveness of the tests also depends on how many people come forward to participate. Thus, the measure should be better publicized.
The possibility of these tests coming too late is very real. In fact, the results from the South Coast Air Quality Management District alone should be reason enough to shut down the plant permanently.
According to the Times, its report states that there were elevated levels of arsenic emitting from the plant that threaten the lives of more than 100,000 people. The same risk assessment gauged that from Boyle Heights to Huntington Park, more than 250,000 people faced a chronic hazard from arsenic.
Blood tests could be a good start, but to really get to the bottom of this for real answers as to whether or not the plant is life-threatening, efforts must be more genuine and serious. This round of tests shouldn’t just be about allaying concerns but about assessing actual risk. What the city needs is an extensive epidemiological study comparing lead levels in representative samples of residents from multiple distances from the plant. It’s time to put people before profits.

She can’t stop. Miley Cyrus refuses to stop displaying her sexuality, whether she twerks on stage or swings nude on a wrecking ball in her latest music video. Though her single sits at the top of the iTunes chart, she ends up simply being a topic of discussion and voyeurism. In the end, she does not deserve criticism for her sexual expression.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
Cyrus is one of many female pop stars that has shed her teen-pop and tween appeal for a more mature and extremely sexualized image. And like big teen acts such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, it is no secret that Cyrus has received negative reactions from the general public to the music community. This negativity represents a double standard regarding sexuality in our culture.
Demeaning comments about her physique and dancing ability are inappropriate and grotesque at the very least. What about male artists such as Robin Thicke, who have executed similar stunts? Let’s think back to Cyrus’ performance during the Video Music Awards. The image that has garnered a significant amount of media attention is Cyrus dancing on Robin Thicke’s groin. While dancing with Thicke, Cyrus twirled around a foam finger, licking it and rubbing it on and between her own legs, as well as Thicke’s. Despite the fact that both were performing a raunchy dance number on the stage, Thicke left the awards show without criticism from the media — even though he is married with a child and nearly two decades older than Cyrus.
Furthermore, his record-breaking chart topper, “Blurred Lines,” features an interesting sexual video of its own. All three of the women in the original video were topless. And though there was a great deal of backlash from the feminist community in regard to the video, mainstream entertainment media wholly ignored it, besides suggesting that it was the reason for the single’s success. A “clean version” (in which the models, instead of being topless, were covered in see-through tops) was issued, but no other reprimand or media frenzy occurred. So why then did Cyrus receive such widespread criticism for both her performance at the VMAs and her new video?
The differences are power and gender.
Unlike the women in Thicke’s video, the public knows Cyrus. What’s more is people can’t stop themselves from comparing her to her clean image as Hannah Montana — the innocent tween pop star.
On the other hand, the women in the “Blurred Lines” video are unknown models and thus viewed as mere sexual objects. Not only do we relegate them to the status of sexualized beings, but as they prance around Thicke, Pharrell Williams and T.I. in the music video, they fall a rung lower to passive sexual figures. During her performance at the VMAs, there was nothing passive about Cyrus. She might have been dancing on Thicke, but she was in complete control, and that is why people have taken offense.
It has taken decades for people to become comfortable with female sexuality, but for many, such an idea is still a foreign concept. Cyrus is in control of her sexuality, but as a familiar figure, she represents the idea of the women in our lives — our daughters, mothers and sisters — being strong sexual beings. To some, the female sexual identity is supposed to be tucked away — hidden behind closed doors — but Cyrus pushes the limits of our concept of women.

I would say that most readers would Hope that your 1st daughter behaves this very same way.
And what will you honestly do about it?
Stand by and Hope for the “best”?
If this was your own flesh & blood?
You liberals ALL have a serious lack of: Discipline, Common Sense, Decency, & Morals.
Good luck with your daughter “discovering” herself among those who would pervert & devour her.
You, too, Kyron Richard, deserve the same exact abuse that she would get.
It’s the Only thing that will bring you to your senses.
Oh, please.  Who gives a flying wrecking ball?
Can we all be intelligent adults and admit BOTH Robin Thicke and Cyrus looked like desperate, talentless hacks? It is hilarious when some women feel they have to defend the actions of Cyrus in the name of equality. It is especially pathetic when they do so because a male in the same situation was not equally berated. Rather then judge the female on her own merits – these so called modern feminists want “equality” regardless how low that might set the bar for both men and women. If anything, this article should not be titled “Miley Cyrus does not deserve ridicule” it should be titled “Miley and douchebag Robin both deserve ridicule”.
Hey women – stop trying to create a society where you misconstrue “equality” with meaning “the same”. Of course biologically men and women are different. To say otherwise is absurd and illustrative of why political correctness has gone too far. Too all the people defending Miley as a beacon of expressive female sexuality – you sound stupid and naive. At best – if you convince people to see your point what have you accomplished? Do you really want more people to agree with you and encourage young women to spread their legs in front of millions of people while they dangle their tongue out like a rabid dog?
Let’s face it – Miley Cyrus is not very attractive, full of talent or interesting. the only way she can stay in the spotlight is to spread her butt crack and be outrageous. No one would pay to just hear her sing. Don’t we want to encourage young women to nurture talent so they can stand on the merits of actual accomplishment instead of Kardashian-esque notoriety?
Lastly – I think the only reason we have people defending Miley is because they want to play the role of the contrarian. I am sure if a bunch of men applauded Miley’s performance and demanded more “performances” of ass-crackery, the feminists would be crying that we should be condemning her act.
So very well.said! You are one journalist yhat believe in equality. Thank you
