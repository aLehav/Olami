USC track and field released the 2019 schedule on Tuesday for both the indoor and outdoor teams featuring both a number of repeat appearances from previous years as well as a few new competitions for the Trojans to put their talent on display.
The indoor season kicks off for the Men and Women of Troy in Albuquerque, N.M. at the Dr. Martin Luther King Invitational, an event in which USC took home 17 top-three finishes, including seven victories combined between the men and women’s squads. 
In the following weeks, the Trojans will make a few visits to colleges as they will compete in the Texas Tech Invitational and return to the Tyson Invitational hosted by the University of Arkansas. In Fayetteville, Ark. last year, USC took first in four different events, including an impressive performance by senior Randall Cunningham, who won the men’s high jump after he cleared 2.25 meters in his first jump.
The University of Washington will again serve as the site for the MPSF Indoor Championships in late February. In last season’s final event before NCAAs, USC managed to take team titles for both the men’s and women’s teams, comfortably beating out UCLA, Stanford, Oregon and 15 other squads from various schools.
At this year’s NCAA Indoor Championships, hosted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Trojans will look to build off their massive success in 2018 when USC broke three American and two world records at the tournament. At the center of these records was Michael Norman, who managed to break the world record in both the men’s 400m as well as the 4x400m relay. As the lone returning member of that historic relay team, sophomore Zach Shinnick will have high expectations for himself once again when the Trojans take center stage in early March.
While the indoor track and field schedule is packed with early season storylines, the outdoor slate promises to be just as exciting. To kick off the season, USC will host the Trojan Invitational, an event which resulted in 11 wins for its athletes a year ago including two for current sophomore Chanel Brissett, who was victorious in both the 100m hurdles and the 100m dash.
The following week, the Trojans will travel to Miami, Fla. to again compete in the Power 5 Trailblazer Challenge. After hosting last season, as well as taking home six wins each on the men’s and women’s sides, USC will look to compete against elite schools such as Ohio State and Ole Miss.
The Power 5 event will also mark the final time that the Trojans travel east of Tucson, Ariz. before the NCAA championship, as the remainder of their schedule keeps the team very close to home. Most notably, the Men and Women of Troy will compete at the Mt. SAC Relays in Torrance, Calif., where the team set two school records in 2018. It will also play host to the USC-UCLA Dual Meet on April 28. In last year’s Crosstown Cup matchup, USC swept the men’s and women’s meets on the backs of strong performances by freshman Earnest Sears III and redshirt junior Dior Hall among other event winners that day.
The month of May will be solely devoted to USC’s quest for Pac-12 and, eventually, NCAA Championships as the team will spend two weekends in Tucson, Ariz. competing against the conference’s best before traveling up to Sacramento, Calif. for the NCAA preliminary competitions. In 2018, Lyndsey Lopes had a particularly dominant run through the Pac-12 Championships, placing fourth in the heptathlon and winning the women’s high jump after clearing a jump at 1.79 meters. Lopes became the first USC conference champion in the women’s high jump and would go on to be named an honorable mention All-American in the event.
To end the season, the Trojans will travel to Austin, Tex. to compete at the national championships, where the women placed first as a team and the men set three collegiate records while taking home a fourth place finish in 2018. 
While last season’s standouts including Michael Norman and Kendall Ellis have since graduated, the Trojans are still well positioned to make headlines once again in 2019.

I’m looking forward to the day when average, run-of-the-mill sports fans make tired jokes on Twitter about how long they “slept on” the WNBA.
Truthfully, most of America has been sleeping on the league since its inception in 1997. I’m just as guilty of this as anyone else —  professional women’s basketball has been around since precisely 14 days after I was born, yet I didn’t watch an entire game until this summer. 
Even for women who love basketball, like me, the WNBA hasn’t always been seen as a viable way to enjoy the sport. I remember one of my teammates in high school joking that her boyfriend had switched on a WNBA game one night, figuring she would know the teams or at least enjoy passively watching. My teammate — our starting point guard, who hoped to play in college — laughed and told him to switch it off since it “wasn’t real basketball anyway.”
Obviously, that was ridiculous. But the idea that women’s sports are somehow inherently inferior to the men’s side of the game remains insidiously powerful, and it’s something that has held back the advancement of many leagues. 
Until this summer, that is, when the WNBA sparked a sudden wave of exuberance surrounding its latest season. The fervor partly came from NBA rookies and other players, who vocalized their support and enthusiasm for the women’s game. Some of it was fueled by popular media figures like Shea Serrano, who took to Twitter to voice his newfound (and often explicit) love for the Las Vegas Aces all summer.
But the main source of excitement surrounding the league was the game itself. Women’s basketball — believe it or not — is exciting as hell to watch, and this summer it hit a new level. From Liz Cambage shattering single-game records to the explosive impact of A’ja Wilson in Las Vegas, the women’s game is the best it’s ever been. If you were ever thinking of becoming a fan, now is the time.
Attempting to convince someone to watch something new is one of the hardest things in the world. When it comes to TV shows, I feel like a crazy person ranting on and on about why “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” or “The Good Place” necessitates watching right this second. With women’s sports, it’s even more difficult to put into words a defense because, at its core, it seems ridiculous to defend something that is inherently fun to watch.
Most basketball fans can find something to love about the WNBA. The brand might not be as strong as its male counterpart, but it certainly boasts all of the same qualities. 
Big name players? Check that off with players like Maya Moore, Candace Parker and Brittney Griner. Heated rivalries? Catch about six seconds of a Lynx vs. Sparks game and you’ll get every amount of grit that anyone could hope for from a rivalry. Jaw dropping plays? Basically guaranteed if Breanna Stewart or Skylar Diggins-Smith is on the court.
There’s no point in debating whether there’s some disparity of talent or play between the NBA and WNBA, because the base line is so damn good. If the WNBA is fun to watch, who cares if the NBA is “better” by some degree? The disparity of talent between leagues doesn’t keep basketball fans from switching the TV effortlessly from NCAA to NBA every spring.
At the end of the day, my point is: If you don’t watch the WNBA, at least respect it. Real NBA players like Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James regularly praise the women’s game for its high level of talent. DeAndre Ayton almost cried when he met Diana Taurasi. If respect exists between the two leagues, it should definitely exist between fans of both leagues as well. 
Respecting women’s basketball just makes sense. And now is the time to do it, before becoming a fan just seems like a bandwagon effort.

Redshirt sophomore Trevon Sidney lunges to nab a ball during Wednesday’s practice. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With only nine days left until the first kick off of the season, spirits were high on Howard Johnson Field Wednesday night.
The trio of quarterbacks battling for the starting position saw their highest tally of touches so far in practice, but the evening was dominated by a series of scuffles that distracted from a solid performance for the offense.
Redshirt junior safety Ykili Ross and redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns stopped practice early on with a heated shouting match, with Ross finally storming off the field and taking a lap to cool off. He did not return to practice after the confrontation, but spoke to head coach Clay Helton and remained on the sidelines to watch practice. Helton said that Ross “just got upset” and that the issue will not be a problem for either player moving forward.
Tensions continued to flare as freshman offensive tackle Liam Douglass and redshirt freshman outside linebacker Hunter Echols threw punches at each other during one-on-one drills, and second-year stars junior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. and sophomore safety Bubba Bolden later went head-to-head, tackling each other to the ground before the fight was broken up. Despite the increased chippiness, the mood at practice didn’t seem to faze the coaching staff at all.
“It was awesome,” Helton said. “Didn’t it make practice more fun?”
Young players continue to stand out
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Trevon Sidney stood out throughout practice, snagging two one-handed grabs and snatching a lengthy catch in the end zone. After several seasons of struggling to get snaps, Sidney’s flashy play in practice seems to signal his readiness to become a solid contributor to the offense.
On the opposite side of the ball, freshman cornerback Olaijah Griffin stood out as well, making an interception off redshirt sophomore quarterback Matt Fink and later almost grabbing a second before tumbling out of bounds. In the absence of Jack Jones, Griffin’s performance continues to be a sign of encouragement for the secondary.
As part of the opening activities, Helton invited students from across campus to watch the team on Wednesday, and gathered them on the field after practice concluded to talk about the upcoming season.
Injury report
Redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Bernard Schirmer was forced to leave practice after suffering what appeared to be a shoulder injury. He left early on to receive examination from trainers, and will undergo an MRI to confirm that there isn’t an injury. Schirmer transferred from junior college amid controversy in March after making headlines for knocking out a referee in a game.
Senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware was not in attendance at practice as a precaution due to soreness in his knee. Freshman running back Markese Stepp returned for limited reps while still recovering from a concussion, and senior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga returned to full activity.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last October, approximately 80 residents living in seven apartment complexes on Exposition Boulevard received eviction notices, requiring them to leave their homes within 90 days. Two real estate investors, Chung Suk Kim and Hae Jung Kim, purchased the buildings for $8.5 million and immediately began planning to renovations exclusively for USC students. After protesting the evictions for 10 months, the tenants now face an uncertain future and possible eviction.
While unjust and undeserved, the terms of these evictions are not illegal because the apartments were not protected by the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance. The evicted tenants, who are mostly working class families from disadvantaged backgrounds, were not given enough time or payment to find new places to live, according to the Los Angeles Tenants Union.
This is not a new phenomenon by any means. USC’s presence is notorious for bringing in new development,  and consequently gentrifying the surrounding neighborhood, displacing people — particularly, people of color — to make way for students who can pay higher rates for housing. Real estate investors see a major opportunity here, as they can secure a hefty dime from USC students if they buy and remodel buildings in the area, pushing out poor and working class people in the process.
After the completion  of USC Village, the University promised to donate millions of dollars to the Los Angeles Housing Department. This donation would ostensibly go toward ensuring affordable housing in the local community. However, the impending evictions on Exposition Boulevard indicate that we have yet to see any kind of positive changes.
Landlords know they can charge USC students higher rates than local residents. But these people deserve stable, affordable housing, and we should not simply allow investors to kick out our neighbors for students’ sakes. While USC claims it is taking steps to aid the housing crisis around campus, it needs a more direct plan; otherwise, this displacement will continue. 
Los Angeles is seeing one of its largest rent strikes in modern history occurring in the Westlake area, where a group of landlords imposed rent hikes despite horrid conditions like faulty sewage pipes and pest infestations. About 200 families living on South Burlington Avenue currently refuse to pay their rent in response to these unaffordable rent increases. 
The reality is that Los Angeles faces a dire housing crisis. USC is an expanding institution; it leaves a huge mark on its community and is in no way exempt from culpability in the urgent issues of displacement and homelessness.
As USC students, we are the demographic  developers, and landlords would rather have us as conduits for gentrification rather than the working class people who already live here. By using us, they are effectively pitting our interests against those of our neighbors’. The eviction letter from the Exposition real estate investors even stated that the vacant apartments would be marketed toward USC students. Students should feel ashamed to be associated as a reason for these evictions. 
USC students care about our community in different ways. While we already reach out to our local institutions, we must also make housing stability a priority for our neighbors if we truly want our community to thrive.
While the evictees’ futures on Exposition remain unclear, the USC community must rethink how it impacts the housing crisis in this neighborhood. The tenants have had little political success fighting the Kims — in fact they have yet to secure a meeting with their councilmember. But USC has significant political bargaining power and could use it to fight for rather than against the victims of displacement.
If USC students pay tuition to this school, we should have a say in how it operates. If we don’t want to see our neighbors displaced, we must put pressure on the school’s administration to protect them. Our University has the ability to improve and enrich the lives of its neighbors. 
Displacing our neighbors is not a solution to crime and poverty. It breeds only homelessness and desperation among already vulnerable households, many of whom have lived in the area much longer than the average University student. If anything, allowing landlords to buy up surrounding buildings and evicting their tenants will instill a sense of resentment for USC.
As a community that strives for justice, USC must focus on investing in the economic security of local residents who established their lives in the area long before many of us even knew we would be spending four years here. All L.A. residents deserve adequate housing, not just the ones who pay tuition to USC. 
We have a choice to either fall victim to our stereotype as thoughtless rich kids disrupting a vulnerable community or to otherwise stand with those people unjustly evicted from their homes. By choosing the latter, not only will we present an obstacle to future displacement but we will also kickstart positive changes in the community by acknowledging and valuing its people’s rights to live here.

I am writing to the editor to plead that the University of Southern California require access to naloxone in higher-risk areas of our community, including University-affiliated Greek organizations. Naloxone, commonly referred to by its brand name Narcan, is a lifesaving drug that reverses the effects of opioid overdose, and is believed to save thousands of lives annually.
The first time I saw someone overdose in front of me, I was 17 years old. It was early dawn, and I was volunteering at a Boston homeless shelter, preparing breakfast with some of my classmates. A man collapsed, his skin turning a pale gray. Before I even understood what was happening, a female shelter employee was administering Narcan through a nasal spray while another employee called an ambulance. I had lost friends to opioid overdoses, but I had never witnessed one until that moment. 

When the press recently started to cover the opioid epidemic in Southern California, I was taken aback. I was raised in Massachusetts, and I have been aware of opioid abuse for as long as I can remember. I have lost close friends to accidental and preventable overdoses, and I have lost others to addiction. When certain publications began explaining what Narcan is, I was stunned. I first learned about the drug in middle school health class, and was taught how to administer it in high school. I couldn’t fathom a world in which Narcan’s uses were not known. It was almost as if the people of California refused to acknowledge it as a solution because that meant we first had to acknowledge the opioid problem. 

According to the World Health Organization, naloxone is considered an “essential medicine” because of its highly beneficial impact. A single dose of generic naloxone can be purchased for $20–40, and includes all necessary components to fully reverse the effects of an overdose. According to the Food and Drug Administration, naloxone has proven its effectiveness beyond reasonable medical doubt. It also poses no negative health effects if administered when unnecessary. There is no risk in having doses of Narcan available in areas where people may experience overdoses. 
Although we are facing a public health crisis, we are also afforded an incredibly inexpensive and simple short-term solution to this issue. The majority of states have passed legislation legalizing to the purchase naloxone with or without a prescription. It can legally be administered by any individual, with or without medical training. Those who administer the drug are protected under California law against civil and criminal action, commonly referred to as “good samaritan” laws, allowing for faster emergency response time. Narcan, and most forms of naloxone are packaged as nasal sprays, and can be administered as easily as common cold medicine. 

What I am suggesting falls into the category of third-party access, which means certain individuals who are not abusing opioids are in possession of Narcan in the event that another individual overdoses. It is not an unprecedented suggestion. In fact, the Clinton Foundation and Adapt Pharma, the manufacturers of Narcan, are working together to provide free Narcan to high schools and colleges across the United States in an effort to increase awareness of the drug and its benefits. There are no recorded studies showing that access to overdose reversal medication, such as Narcan, encourages drug abuse. 

As we continue our education, it is important to remember that we are never completely aware of the plights of our friends and classmates. At many events on or near campus, non-USC students are allowed to enter or participate, and we likely know even less about those individuals. This is why I am pleading the case that the University require all affiliated Greek life and high-risk school sponsored events have accessible naloxone. It is inexpensive, easy to use, effective and has no harmful side effects if administered unnecessarily. There is no reason we should not have this lifesaving medicine on hand, and there is every reason we should. 
No life is untouched by the reaches of opioid addiction. It is a silent killer of our community. Many people fail to acknowledge the staggering impact that addiction and abuse has on the Trojan Family. At this critical juncture, it is imperative that we do our part to ensure the wellbeing of our fellow students and our community. Anything less than that could be deadly.

When living and studying at an institution like USC, it’s easy to forget the outside world. As students, we’re usually attending classes in fancy buildings and learning from esteemed professors. We also have easy access to a vast array of resources, from things as basic as Wi-Fi to things as complex as research databases.
The setting in which our learning takes place is relatively ideal. The university system is constantly working to improve our access to educational opportunities. And that’s amazing. Most of the students here are passionate about learning, and USC allows them to learn about nearly everything they desire. 
At the same time, our idyllic institution exists in an almost separate world from the surrounding neighborhood. Just a couple hundred feet away from the beautiful red brick architecture that defines USC is a community of families and individuals who, for the most part, are living without the privileged prospect of attending a private university.
If you stay close to campus for most of the year, that community doesn’t have to enter your consciousness very often. It’s easy to stay within the confines of the red bricks, especially when they convey familiarity and safety. 
But last year, I got a firsthand look into the community surrounding USC and some of the issues it faces when it comes to education. I taught at Hoover Intergenerational Care, a preschool located next to the Caruso Catholic Center. I was there almost every weekday for USC’s Americorps Jumpstart program, which provides language and literacy education to the kids. 
Having the opportunity to work with toddlers through Jumpstart and watch them grow is a truly a rewarding experience; I was able to see the impact of my presence in the classroom by the end of the school year. 
Being at Hoover felt antithetical to being at USC for me; not a single one of my students was white, while about 30 percent of USC students are white. And none of my students were paying to go to preschool: Hoover is a state-subsidized school for low-income families. At USC, families pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for an education, a cost that would be unfathomable to the low-income families living just off campus. 
And yet, the kids at Hoover are still lucky. Because they live across the street from a major university, they’re getting tons of additional help. Student-teachers like me are volunteering their time; the medical schools are providing them with free basic health care like dental check-ups; and when they’re older, and they may be able to attend the 32nd Street/USC Magnet School, where their education will again be bolstered by USC’s resources.
But there are kids just like them all across the United States who aren’t getting the same resources.
I firmly believe that education — from preschool to college — is highly determinative of an individual’s future success. If we aren’t investing in our children’s education from an early stage, we’re setting children up to remain disadvantaged for the rest of their lives. For the most part, the kids who lack access to a great education already come from low-income or minority backgrounds.
While political discussion has become a more commonplace occurrence on social media, education is still a topic that is largely excluded from public discourse, unless U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos pulls some stunt that lights up Twitter and inspires a smattering of sensational headlines. So throughout the semester with this column, I want to talk about what America needs to do to fix our education system. 
And not just at the preschool level with kids like the ones I taught at Hoover. Education is a formative experience that spans about two — maybe even three — decades of people’s lives, and there are systemic flaws at every level.
I want to discuss the ways we can support bilingual students: We can’t teach them English, but must also encourage them to use and value the other languages they grew up with in early education. I want to talk about the importance of diversity among teachers, especially in elementary and middle schools. I want to explore school disciplinary practices and the school-to-prison pipeline prevalent at many high schools. 
Education at USC is important, too — I want to talk about college affordability and access, so the kids at Hoover who live in the shadow of our towering red bricks can one day see themselves attending USC or a similarly prestigious university. I want to discuss barriers preventing entry into academia, and how bias makes it hard for women and people of color to become tenured faculty. 
Education matters because it provides a bedrock foundation for future success. We can no longer champion the American dream or the rags-to-riches philosophy because it isn’t realistic. But I believe that if we can give low-income and minority students the same access to education that more privileged students have, it can set them up to make their American dreams really come true.

Stanley Kalu, a senior majoring in writing for film and television, won The LAUNCH Million Dollar Screenplay Competition for his screenplay “The Obituary of Tunde Johnson.” His film explores the life of a wealthy, black high school senior who continually faces the obstacle of police brutality. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The LAUNCH, an international screenplay competition, puts the question of “what would you do if you had a million dollars” to rest.
Late last year, writer and producer — and USC alumnus — Jason Shuman approached his colleague Zachary Green with a proposition from philanthropists Chuck and Marni Bond: a screenwriting competition for college students that would give them the means to bring their film ideas to life. 
Green and Shuman brainstormed the best use of the money and came up with The LAUNCH Million Dollar Screenplay Competition. Students over the age of 18 and enrolled in a two-year, four-year or graduate school program are eligible to submit their screenplays for a $1 million prize to go toward production costs.
“We thought that if we had the ability to try to give back just a little bit and to have this screenplay competition for college students to be able to find new, undiscovered talents and be able to help them break in the business as well as pay for the rising cost of college would be an amazing thing to do,” Green said.
According to Green, hundreds of screenplays were submitted from 208 colleges and universities in 37 countries and 33 states from the United States. The submissions were evaluated by the LAUNCH Board of Advisors, ScreenCraft and technology platform Coverfly.
Out of those hundreds, USC student Stanley Kalu’s was chosen.
“Everyone read the top 25, and we all met for a meeting and it was a pretty wonderful discussion of how touched and impressed and moved everyone was by Stanley’s screenplay,” Shuman said. “We talked for a long time about which one should win and when it came down to it, it was pretty unanimous that everyone was excited to help Stanley tell his story.”
Kalu, a senior majoring in writing for film and television, was born in Nigeria and has lived all over sub-Saharan Africa. He came to the United States to attend USC and began writing “The Obituary of Tunde Johnson” in his screenwriting class as a sophomore.
“I wrote it in one draft and had been sending it out places. It did pretty well last year … but I didn’t win anything,” Kalu said. “This year I still had it and I just kept sending it out and I finally won something.”
“The Obituary of Tunde Johnson” tells the story of a wealthy, black high school senior who is subjected to an endless loop of police brutality. 
“I moved a lot in my life,” Kalu said of his inspiration for the screenplay. “I moved all over Africa, and what that does to a person and their perspective is you’re constantly being introduced to new spaces.”  
Kalu was shocked by American culture and institutionalized racism when he arrived. He came to America during a time when police brutality was prevalent, following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. 
But he was also surprised at how accepting American culture is to the LGBTQ community.
“Where I’m from, our queer culture is really subjugated rather violently,” Kalu said. “I thought it was really, really, really beautiful to see the culture embrace … the idea of homosexuality and being queer and being proud of [that] fact.”
It was experiencing and interacting with these elements of American culture that inspired Kalu’s script.
In addition to winning the $1 million to produce his film, Kalu is receiving a $50,000 educational grant. The remaining seven finalists will also be receiving education grants, and second- and third-place winners will be landing representation. 
Production for “The Obituary of Tunde Johnson” is set to start  this October.

The Trojan Marketing Group recently collaborated with the American Cancer Society of Los Angeles to develop a digital campaign in the Los Angeles area. The campaign was created to promote ACS’s “Road to Recovery,” which provides transportation for cancer patients who need to be driven to treatment centers.
Since last September, TMG has been working closely with ACS to convey the program’s message. According to Dan Witzling, executive director of ACS’s Los Angeles chapter, the goal of the campaign is to increase awareness of how volunteering can create more affordable transportation for those diagnosed with cancer. 
“At the most basic level, the need is that there are more cancer patients that are requesting rides and treatments than what we have been able to provide and that is through any means,” Witzling said. “Next to the cost of treatments, transportation is one of the single highest barriers to care.”
To recruit new drivers through the campaign, TMG began with market research to determine why individuals are not currently volunteering. At the end of their research, the group concluded that the perception of volunteers being “held to the standard of saints” prevented others to not envision themselves as eligible to volunteer, according to creative director Hannah Nowak.
 With this new insight, Nowak and her colleagues began planning for the digital commercial towards their targeted age group of caregiver-type females ages 35 to 55 in the Los Angeles area.
Video producer Kris Nguyen coordinated with the other TMG members to host an on-campus casting call in March to promote to Los Angeles-area casting agencies for the roles. Nguyen shared how the project provided insight into how to create a full-scale advertising campaign.
“It was an illuminating process because it was the first time for me doing something for a client this big and with a project that requires a lot of attention to detail [… and] learning how to deal with clients and how they spend their money,” Nguyen said.
After researching and brainstorming, TMG practiced pitching their final concept in front of a panel of industry professionals and professors to provide constructive feedback before the final pitch to ACS Board of Directors. The final video features two separate mothers helping their children get ready in the morning before school, and while one of the mothers is out on the road, she picks up the second mother to take her to her cancer treatment.
“They really try to emphasize in the campaign that both of the moms are struggling in the morning,” TMG vice president Emily Heuring said. “It is not perfect, it’s rushed, they are helping their kids with their homework like they are not some superhero — they are like a mom.  We wanted people to be able to relate with both of them so that they felt like they would be good enough to do this themselves.”
This is the first time TMG has worked with the ACS; however, the group has collaborated with other clients including start-ups, clothing brands and food industries. Nowak explained how on each project, the group specializes on the particular industry they are marketing for with a clear demographic. For this campaign, TMG had to determine what the ideal messaging and demographic of the campaigns should be.
“To have to do that for each different campaign is always really unique, but for this campaign specifically, it was really difficult for us to find what type of demographic we actually want to get,” Nowak said. “We could target Uber drivers -— they have free time, like they are willing to drive — but we needed something more nurturing. I think that was the most unique part of the campaign to find that type of person. And people that are willing to donate their time.”
After months of pitching and reviewing the corporate structure of the ACS, Witzling shared the finalized video that will be launched soon. Distribution will start in Los Angeles with aspirations to expand the advertisement campaign nationwide.
Witzling looks forward to the release of the campaign and reflected on his positive experience working with TMG to forward the message of the ACS.  
“Coming from that level and what they were able to do at a very highly professional level,” Witzling said. “The volunteer board was very impressed, the staff was impressed definitely at the level of some other major marketing concepts that we’ve seen in some very advanced companies we get involved with. They definitely took great pride in their work and you could see that and we were pretty pleased with the outcome.”

Sophomore Katherine Ho had 24 hours to submit a demo after being asked by music producer Ben Bram. She performed Coldplay’s “Yellow” in Mandarin for the film “Crazy Rich Asians.” (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
When audiences rushed into theaters Wednesday for the release of “Crazy Rich Asians” — a comedy that has gained significant attention for its representation of Asian culture —  the song they heard accompanying the final scenes was sung by a USC student.
The daughter of Chinese immigrants from Thousand Oaks, Calif., Katherine Ho is a sophomore majoring in biological sciences and minoring in songwriting.
Her song “Liu Xing” (“Shooting Star”), a Mandarin cover of Coldplay’s “Yellow,” appeared in the final act of the film, marking the end of a dramatic scene between characters Rachel Chu and Eleanor Young. 
Ho said it was significant to her in the larger context of Asian American representation in Hollywood, particularly in the first major movie with an all-Asian cast since “The Joy Luck Club” was released 25 years ago.
“To me, the Mandarin lyrics tell a story of taking a leap of faith to pursue a dream or person/thing you love,” Ho wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “On a broader level, for me, this song embodies what it means to be Asian American. Getting to put a Mandarin twist on one of my all-time favorite Western songs was a sort of musical marriage between the two cultural worlds that have shaped my identity.”
Ho delved into the world of music at a young age. She started playing classical piano at age five and began taking voice lessons at nine. Since then, Ho has been singing and dancing in every annual production of the Chinese New Year show in her hometown.
Her first professional singing job was as a children’s choir singer in the film “Valentine’s Day,” before she went on to start a YouTube channel in eighth grade dedicated to covers, live performances and original songs.
In high school, Ho performed in choir and music clubs, competed on Season 10 of NBC’s reality television competition, “The Voice,” and attended an a cappella summer camp for three years.
In January 2017, Ho received a phone call from Ben Bram, one of the camp’s founders, asking if she could sing in Mandarin and if he could submit her work for a film/TV project. Ho had to submit a partial demo of Coldplay’s “Yellow” in Mandarin within 24 hours. A few days later, after she started losing hope in the opportunity, Ho received a email saying she got the job and immediately called her parents to share the good news. 
“I couldn’t believe that I would have the honor of being attached, even in a minor way, to the same project as my idol Constance Wu,” Ho wrote. “My mom and dad were super proud and happy — they have always unconditionally supported my singing, and I think the fact that I got to sing in Mandarin made it all the more special.”
While lots of practice went into preparing herself for the recording session, it wasn’t until about an hour before that a Warner Brothers executive called Ho and told her the song was for “Crazy Rich Asians.”
Ho said that despite the song’s significance in the film, it almost didn’t make it in the final version. After Coldplay initially rejected the proposal to use the track, the film’s director, John Chu, who graduated from USC in 2003, wrote the band a letter on what the song meant to him. 
“He explained how their song transformed “yellow” from a derogatory, ugly, negative term to a beautiful, magical one that re-defined his self-image,” Ho said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Following the release of the film, many viewers have reached out to Ho to share their emotional experiences when listening to the song. 
“One of the most memorable messages I have received is from a 26-year-old Chinese American who told me that the song was ‘the first time in my life I thought that this language, the language of my family and my culture, was beautiful.’” Ho wrote. 
Alongside Ho, several other Trojans were involved in the making of the film.  Cheryl Koh, who graduated in 2018 with a degree in business administration, sings the opening and remixed  the credit song “Money (That’s What I Want)” with Awkwafina, while Kina Grannis, who graduated in 2007 with a degree in social sciences sings “Can’t Help Falling in Love” during the wedding scene. 
Ho said she felt grateful to be a part of a “historic” film. 
“Seeing people that looked like me represented on screen was honestly quite an eye-opening, emotional experience whose value is hard to put into words,” Ho said.

Following a summer submerged in USC scandals and a year of increasing awareness about sexual misconduct, feminism has risen to top of the pot. Looking at the headlines, one could say that the push for gender equality has become more prominent, if not stronger, than ever before. 
On Aug. 27, the day after Women’s Equality Day, the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment (SAGE) will host USC’s first ever Feminist Involvement Fair, a biannual forum to raise awareness for gender empowerment, at McCarthy Quad from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. A variety of on- and off-campus organizations will be present — including Planned Parenthood L.A., the Feminist Majority Foundation and the Gender Studies Department. There are also many unexpected organizations on the list; many of them are not overtly focused on gender issues, but their participation is a reminder that gender issues comprise the basis of so many other issues, and taking steps toward gender equality can help in resolving other societal issues. 
USC’s Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, which oversees 26 Asian Pacific American member organizations on campus, is one of the organizations participating in the Feminist Involvement Fair. Women of color tend to be forgotten and underrepresented in society, making women’s rights minority rights as well. Many of feminism’s flagship issues — the gender wage gap, reproductive rights and gender discrimination — disproportionately affect women of color more than their white peers. The inclusion of groups that fight for minority representation, like APASA and Black Women for Wellness, is an acknowledgement of these issues.
USC Women of Cinematic Arts will also be present, helping draw attention to gender equality in media and entertainment. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the subsequent #MeToo movement, the film industry has been rocked with the sudden exposure of the countless cases of gender inequality and sexual harassment and violence. Our film school and various industry-related organizations like USC Women of Cinematic arts have become instrumental in fighting gender inequality on campus. Prominent donors  like director Bryan Singer have gone unacknowledged by USC and its programs because of sexual misconduct allegations. But cases like Singer’s are indicative of the nature of sexual assault — though it is a feminist issue, it is also one for all genders. Gender empowerment is needed in all circles of society and industry, and organizations like the Women of Cinematic Arts are helping to promote equality not only on campus, but also for USC’s own representation in society and industry.
USC’s Environmental Student Assembly is also participating in the Feminist Involvement Fair. But environmental issues appear to be isolated from other societal issues — it is thought that they are solved through innovation, technology and collective lifestyle choices. However, environmental dangers affect not only minority groups, but the reproductive safety and health of women around the globe, as poor air and water quality has proven detrimental effects on female reproductive health. The presence of USC Environmental Student Assembly is a reminder that feminism is a global issue, just as environmental protection is, and both affect each other in different ways.
A more overtly feminism related club is USC Family Planning, which works to provide information on various facets of family planning, such as  reproductive rights, contraception and sex education. Though its services may seem intuitive, many students are unaware of this campus resource, and its participation in the Feminist Involvement Fair will hopefully raise awareness and provide important information to those who need it. 
This event is a laudable step toward awareness on our campus, and brings forth so many otherwise forgotten issues. The wide-ranging Feminist Involvement Fair successfully shows that feminism does not stop with #MeToo exposes and Women’s Marches — it affects all marginalized groups, and requires constant, steady action toward progress.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Come fall semester, USC is overrun  with wide-eyed freshmen. But as the school year begins to run its course, these students will not be able to participate in a number of social activities. That is because students are now prohibited from participating in Greek rush until they’ve completed at least 12 units at USC. While this newly effective policy may have detrimental repercussions for Greek organizations, freshmen may now have more opportunities to engage in other facets of campus life during their first semester at USC. 
There are some drawbacks to Greek life that are important to note no matter which semester one decides to rush, but that’s not to say all Greek life is bad. Overall, waiting a semester to rush might actually be a good thing. 
Most new freshmen have probably just become independent from their parents for the first time. Some are only hours away from home, but others may be multiple time zones away. Regardless of distance, now that they are free of parental supervision, it’s the perfect time for freshmen to reinvent themselves by getting involved in new groups or throwing themselves back into tried-and-true favorites. USC has a plethora of clubs and organizations for anyone to join, and no matter one’s passion, there is probably already an established club for it. 
Now is also the time to branch out and meet new people everywhere. The friends you make this way may even be more natural and genuine than the ones made under the semi-forced circumstances perpetuated by rush. That’s not to say Greek relationships are less genuine, just that they result in a different kind of bond. While Greek organizations market themselves as “families” and “homes” and claim spring rush will be a detriment to incoming students’ sense of loneliness, the reality is that friends can really be found anywhere on campus. Further, with rush beginning the first week of the semester, the “grouping-off” or alienation of those in different houses or those who are unaffiliated becomes apparent very quickly. With an extra semester to lay down roots and make other friends before rushing, one is likely to have a community of individuals who cares about them across all reaches of campus if and when they do decide to rush.    
While at USC, one’s primary goal should be to be a student. The intensity of rushing while adjusting to a new academic schedule can be a harmful hindrance to one’s college transition. Having a freed-up first semester to work on one’s scheduling and academic workload is more important than most people think. Learning how to prioritize and still make time for the fun things will be vital later on in life. Sure, one might not get this practice down to a tee by the end of their first semester, but they may have a good enough grasp of it to take on the time commitment of rushing in subsequent semesters.
One might even reconsider rushing at all. While Greek life isn’t inherently tainted, there are many negative aspects to think about before heading down to 28th  Street. The first thing to be wary of before going to any fraternity party is that while they are “pro-consent” organizations, Greek life is notorious for sexual violence.  At USC, on average, just under 30 percent of women report having been sexually assaulted. Granted, not all of them are associated with the Greek system, but both men and women involved in Greek life are more likely to be involved.
  Another factor in the argument against rushing is the cost. While initiation fees at public universities start as low as $20, initiation at USC can cost up to about $100 at a minimum. With fees commonly reaching $4,000 a semester, Greek life is another indicator of the class divide at this University. While USC may abide by blind admissions when it comes to a family’s financial need, the University still upholds this tradition that puts in stark contrast who is paying full tuition and who isn’t. And while some of our letter-clad classmates mean well or they just really don’t know why anyone wouldn’t rush, making everyone wait a semester gives those same classmates a chance to assimilate with the rest of the student body and get along as if it were the real world. 
Lastly, propaganda aside, realistically only about 15 percent of the school’s population actually  successfully rushes and is accepted into a Greek house. In 2010, out of an incoming class of about 8,000, only 1,800 people rushed with only 1,200 receiving a bid. Of course this year will be different, but even given those previous odds, the slim statistic is pretty disappointing. Moreover, the exclusivity those in the system so often tout can only be partly attributed to their own the discriminatory nature of the process. In reality, they should fess up and admit that not that many people are interested in Greek life. The real world isn’t Animal House. By waiting a semester, one can decide if a “family” that is this small and selective is really one they’d like to join.
However, Greek life has its merits. If someone does decide to rush, they will potentially gain lifelong friendships and professional connections. In the meantime, they will have built-in social relationships and plenty of activities to pass their college days. Moreover, and on a very promising note, according to a study by Cornell University, of the approximately two percent of Greek alumni in the U.S., 80 percent have gone on to be Fortune 500 executives, 76 percent serve in Congress and 85 percent became Supreme Court Justices. 
Despite all these merits, freshmen should still consider waiting until later semesters to reap the benefits of the Greek system. Ultimately, the University made the healthiest decision for everyone involved, even those not involved.  
A viable alternative to Greek rush is to join a fraternity for special interests such as film, community service and law. These organizations offer many of the same social and professional benefits to their members. 
But with regard to Greek rush, the University has already spoken — and its decision is a good one. Freshmen will now be able to take extra time to find themselves, their friends and their independence before deciding which Greek letters to don, if any, instead of feeling swept into the system from day one. Thus when freshmen do rush it will be on their own volition and they will have adapted enough to college life to be prepared to take on the extra challenges of rushing and (if they’re lucky) pledging.

The summer movie season of 2018 was exciting despite its fluctuating lineup of films. Big blockbusters performed impressively at the box office, but there were also a few intriguing films not in the limelight that are worth revisiting.
Avengers: Infinity War
This giant, $2 billion hit is one of the franchise’s best, and conflict has never felt more palpable or urgent. Instead of bringing Marvel’s 20+ heroes into one giant action set piece, the Russo brothers smartly separated groups of heroes and gave them their own B-plots. This decision helped pace the movie, providing some intriguing pairings, like Thor and Rocket Raccoon or Iron Man and Star-Lord. Josh Brolin’s performance as Thanos is the emotional core that held this somewhat messy film together and elevated it above the franchise’s mundane entries. The first installment of a two-part cinematic event, “Infinity War” is the culmination of Marvel Studios’ first 10 years of cinematic universe building.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
Twenty-five years later, the magic of Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park” has disappeared, and it appears that the remaining cast and crew are simply going through the motions with this passionless new entry “Fallen Kingdom” isn’t even as nostalgia-pandering as the last movie, which begs why it was made — except for obvious monetary reasons. A few interesting scenes couldn’t save the movie from its one-dimensional stereotypes and hilariously bad dialogue. The film hints at the potential for a  franchise that has long overstayed its welcome. Yet, “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” is a must-watch for fans of the original, even if only for another glimpse at its roaring dinosaurs.
Mission: Impossible – Fallout
Tom Cruise continues to push the boundaries of an action movie star at 56 years old with his own stunts in this franchise’s latest installment. Having previously scaled the Burj Khalifa and hanging on a plane taking off, fans know Cruise can do anything, despite his age. Like many of his movies, however, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” suffers from Cruise’s status as an A-list Hollywood star. Because he mostly relies on his public image, he cannot make Ethan Hunt a compelling character, which is highlighted within the intimate scenes that  weigh the movie down to an average one. 
Crazy Rich Asians
The $35 million (and counting) romantic comedy hit of the summer, “Crazy Rich Asians” is a breath of fresh air from pulse-pounding action set pieces and intense, introspective dramas. Paired with director Jon M. Chu’s masterful filmmaking, the diverse, talented cast elevates this movie from other romantic comedies. The glamorous scenes of Singapore and nuanced look into themes of cultural tradition, family and sacrifice, made this a breakout movie for so many rising stars, including first-time actor Henry Golding, British actress Gemma Chan, quirky comedian Awkwafina and “Fresh Off the Boat” star Constance Wu.
First Reformed
From the screenwriter of “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull,” “First Reformed” is a deeply intense look at the conflicting relationship between religion and politics. The movie addresses these themes through a slow-burn story and carefully crafted conversations, requiring the audience’s full attention. Director Paul Schrader pushes the cast to their limits and delivers great performances from Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried and Cedric the Entertainer while Alexander Dynan’s cinematography provides the most gorgeous imagery since “Blade Runner 2049.” Not for the faint of heart, “First Reformed” resonates long after.
Eighth Grade
Former YouTube star and stand-up comedian Bo Burnham provides a snapshot of middle school with this directorial debut. Veering away from the John Hughes 80’s movies, “Eighth Grade” is reminiscent of “Lady Bird,” with its  execution as a coming-of-age story. Burnham portrays the students, especially its star Elsie Fisher, as awkward and unsure of life. And Fisher’s dynamic relationship with her on-screen father Josh Hamilton provides the most sincere moments of the film. Audiences will find at least one element in the movie they can relate to through Burnham’s authentic direction.
Sorry to Bother You
After the cultural phenomenon of “Black Panther,” other like-minded individuals crafted love letters to Oakland that were much more authentic and engaging. As one of these love letters, “Sorry to Bother You” is easily one of the most original films of the year, as it is difficult to classify it in one genre. With insane twists and an Oscar-worthy performance from Armie Hammer (who feels reminiscent of Christoph Waltz’s Hans Landa), Boots Riley’s voice as a director shines brightly, as he creates a truly bizarre and energetic experience.
Blindspotting
A film nine years in the making, “Blindspotting” is the best movie of the year. Childhood friends Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal delve into current-day Oakland, discussing topics like police brutality and gentrification. They approach these topics with brutal honesty, while  balancing the movie’s lighthearted tone. Taking a part from their rap careers, Diggs and Casal create upbeat characters who provide levity as they traverse through the changing environment. Despite underperforming financially, “Blindspotting” deserves more mainstream attention.

For some, the start of university life can be daunting. It’s important to utilize the many resources available to new students. (Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan)
The beginning of college is an exciting yet nerve-wracking time: students can rebrand themselves, make new friends and explore campus. And while some students transition smoothly into this new chapter of their lives, others have trouble adjusting.
Here’s a list of things every incoming freshman should know for an enjoyable and rewarding start to their college years.
Many events offer unique opportunities that are not found anywhere else
While the number of clubs and events on campus can be overwhelming, attend as many as possible. The University welcomes people and opportunities that are not readily available in the outside world. From famous YouTubers to former presidents, there are always exciting people to see give talks and meet right on campus.
It’s normal to question and explore other academic routes.
The fear of choosing the wrong major is daunting, and many students go through that indecision about the majors they chose in high school. Whether the reason for indecision is a bad class or the realization that the major did not live up to expectations, there is nothing wrong with exploring new opportunities and choosing from various options. In the end, students will be much happier switching majors until they find the right fit than struggling for our years in a major they dislike.
College writing takes some getting used to
Expectations for written assignments in high school and college can be vastly different. For those struggling to pass the notorious WRIT 150, the University has a writing center on the third floor of Taper Hall that is open to all students. Here, students can have their essays edited, improve their resumes or even just practice writing with the help of writing advisors. 
McCarthy Quad hosts a farmer’s market on Wednesdays 
For those who get tired of eating the same food in the dining halls every day, the farmer’s market is a chance to find something fresh and new without having to leave campus. Get in line to enjoy poke, pad thai or pupusas from the different vendors. The market also offers delicious fresh fruits and other items such as jewelry, spices and knickknacks. 
Don’t be afraid to go to professors’ office hours
Transitioning from a 30-person class in high school to a 200-person lecture in college can be daunting, and it may feel difficult to get to know anyone in the class, let alone the professor, which is exactly why freshmen should make the effort of getting to know teachers. They’re people too– talk to them about their lives and careers.
You don’t have to drink or smoke to make friends
It may seem like everyone on campus is partying. At times, the pressure to drink or smoke can be overwhelming, but know that many students don’t drink or smoke at all. This is a respectable decision that clubs, organizations and classmates completely accept. Without alcohol, there are still countless ways to make friends and participate in your own college experience, so make decisions based on your comfort.
It’s okay to feel insecure and unsure about college
For many new students, it takes at least a few weeks or even months to settle into college life, so it is common to feel no sense of belonging early on.  In this period, join as many organizations as possible, explore new hobbies and do not be afraid to meet new people. Overtime, that close-knit community will start to develop again and the feeling will start to go away.
Four years pass by quickly
If it felt like four years of high school passed by quickly, then the four years of college will feel even shorter. It could be the period one claims was the best time of their life, so do not waste any time languishing in the dorms and pushing back events thinking there’ll always be more time to do something. Don’t think a class is impossible because only upperclassmen seem to be in the class, and don’t avoid joining an organization because its members seem intimidating. Four years are going to go by very fast, so students should reach out to people they find interesting.

Directed by James Morosini, “Threesomething” was released on Tuesday and is available on most streaming services like iTunes, Google Play, Amazon and Vudu. (Photo courtesy of Morosini Sonenshine Productions)
One night, three friends — Charlie, Isaac and Zoe — agree to have a threesome. However, the decision affects them all in different ways after the fact. Two fall in love; two test their limits. All three arrive at a more honest friendship.
Written by Morosini and fellow alumnus, producer and co-star Sam Sonenshine, “Threesomething,” which was released Tuesday, began as a passion project. Yet, the friendship-driven film saw an official selection at the Cinequest Film Festival, as well as a teaser that went viral with eight million views. 
Already a well-known name in the industry, Morosini previously starred in multiple seasons of “American Horror Story,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” after graduating from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts. His co-star, Sam Sonenshine, also had multiple acting credits to his name, including the television series “Switched at Birth.” 
Prior to the film’s conception, Morosini and Sonenshine took to the drawing board, discussing the feasibility of their ideas and reviewing logistics and resources.  Soon after, the two filmmakers brought in their friend, actress Isabelle Chester, who plays Zoe in the movie. The trio thought about where they all were in their lives and how they could incorporate it into their film, thus landing upon the core narrative of “Threesomething.” 
Morosini and Sonenshine as male directors developed much of the storyline through their discussions with Chester because they wanted to integrate the female perspective into the story. 
“Involving actors in crafting the story is somewhat unconventional but added so much and was one of my favorite parts of the process,” Morosini said.
Not only did Morosini seek narrative advice from his actors, but he also encouraged them to improvise, drawing upon Lynn Shelton and Joe Swanberg’s works for inspiration. Morosini said these directors were critical in helping him conceive “Threesomething,” as he wished to capture the same authenticity and realism that Shelton and Swanberg demonstrated in films like “Laggies” and “Drinking Buddies.” 
He also explained why the film’s low budget was an important component of his vision.
“We were making a small rom-com, where the value exists in its authenticity, so spending money on a massive crew was obviously not in our interest,” Morosini said. 
The pair also emphasized the importance of shooting for extra days to perfect the scenes rather than having fewer days with more elaborate setpieces and big-name talent. Overall, the film took only 20 days to shoot, with some pickups and reshoots.
“[On a bigger set] there are hundreds of people involved, whereas on something like ‘Threesomething,’ there’s five people,” Morosini said. “Someone can have an idea, and you can change gears quickly to explore it and […] capture lightning in a bottle.”
Morosini’s amenable mentality was reflected in the film’s depiction of love and marriage. For instance, the director veered away from the typical scripted setting of movies and vouched for having the characters talk in real time, including colloquial elements like pauses and stutters. 
“What was important to us was capturing the basic messiness of human expression and interaction, and its misinterpretations and sloppiness,” Morosoni said. “We all want to sound smart and feel special. We stop being who we are by trying to be who we think we should be. And I think for many people, including myself, nothing brings this up more than sex.”
The pair tried to portray marriage in a similar manner, as “Threesomething” presents the phenomenon in ways that would typically be deemed unconventional. Morosini mentioned that most people only have a loose understanding of the fact that the film is supposed to be based off what they’ve heard from movies, television or stories. 
“They want so badly to be in the moment and feel the grandiosity of a moment like marriage, that they’re making all these arbitrary decisions manufacturing excitement and big feelings,” said Morosini.
While this was a loose framework for the movie’s message, Sonenshine expressed how he cares more about people having a good time watching the movie instead of fully understanding the movie’s themes. 
“In terms of spectacle and big setpieces, hopefully people watching ‘Threesomething’  feel like they saw an emotional spectacle,” Sonenshine said, “or [that] they see certain moments and say, ‘That’s an emotional set piece’”
Audience members now have a chance to watch the movie, which is available for streaming on most major services like iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, and Vudu. 
The School of Cinematic Arts will also hold a special screening of the film in the Ray Stark Family Theatre on Thursday.

Freshman quarterback JT Daniels winds up to throw a ball at practice on Tuesday at Howard Jones Field. He’s competing with sophomore Matt Fink and redshirt freshman Jack Sears for the starting spot. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With just 10 days left until the season opener, head coach Clay Helton remained hesitant to announce the winner of his three-man quarterback competition between true freshman JT Daniels, redshirt sophomore Matt Fink and redshirt freshman Jack Sears. Helton’s decision got even more difficult on Tuesday with Daniels, widely believed to be the frontrunner after his impressive performance throughout training camp, throwing two interceptions in 11-on-11. 
“The same thing it’s always been – decision making, timing, accuracy,” Helton said, when asked what the factors will be in his choice. “We can fix timing and we can fix accuracy a lot better than we can fix the decision making. The guy that makes the best decision and goes to the right guy with the ball the most often is going to have the best chance to lead us to victory.”
Helton acknowledged that Fink has the most experience running the offense since he’s the oldest, yet needs improvement on understanding protections and knowing where his hot routes are. Helton also said that Sears has stood out with his solid arm and athleticism, but still needs to understand the whole offense better. Most notably, however, Helton remained bullish on Daniels. 
Speaking about Daniel’s interceptions, Helton attributed the turnovers more to the savvy play of USC’s veteran defensive backs, noting the Daniels’ timing and decision making were correct. 
Helton also downplayed the importance of the mock games.
“It’s more of a mental game … trying to get substitutions and working on certain situational stuff,” he said. “There’s not as many full speed routes being thrown.” 
Helton reiterated that point by saying Saturday’s final mock game will hold little weight in his final decision. 
“[The focus is] trying to make it as gamelike as possible,” Helton said.  “Substitutions, changing personnel groupings, situations on the QB … all the things that happen in games that make you mad as a coach, and being able to see who’s ready and who needs more time to develop.”
 
Decision Date
Unlike the QB competition two years ago between Sam Darnold and Max Browne, which Browne initially won, Helton isn’t under any pressure to give Fink or Sears a chance due to seniority. The general consensus has been that Helton is tempted by the prospect of having Daniels under center for potentially four years, but it appears now as if he is genuinely undecided. Helton explained that he wants to sit down with all three individually and talk to their parents in a private setting first out of respect and honor to all of the guys before ultimately making the announcement. 
 
Fink’s mindset
Despite speculation that he would look to transfer if he did not win the starting job, Fink emphasized that he remains committed to the program. 
“I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else,” Fink said. “I honestly think this is the best spot for me, and at the end of the day, I’m just going to be the best teammate I can be. I’m a USC Trojan for life, no doubt about it.”

While scrolling through my Twitter feed, I came upon a video interview of Kevin Love and ESPN reporter Jackie MacMullan. Usually, I wouldn’t stop and take time out of my day to watch Love speak. After all, now that LeBron James has left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Los Angeles Lakers, Love doesn’t have that much relevance in my life. 
However, I looked at the screen and saw a beautiful graphic of a player holding a basketball with the text “stigma” standing out. I then read the tweet, which was a quote from Love’s interview. 
“Everybody’s going through something,” Love said. “Success is not immune to depression. I’m trying to change the stigma, not only for people in sports, but all over.”
That caught my attention. When was the last time we really heard athletes speaking out about mental health? Athletes are supposed to be the people with the toughest mindsets. Athletes are supposed to be invincible. In today’s world, professional athletes are supposed to have all the money in the world. How could they possibly be dealing with mental health issues?
Intrigued, I watched Love’s interview and read Part 1 of MacMullan’s five-part series on mental health in the NBA. In her article, she interviewed some of the biggest names in the NBA like Paul Pierce, Chris Bosh and USC alum DeMar DeRozan — all of them speaking about their own individual mental health issues.
DeRozan, was one of the first players to speak out on their mental health. 
“This depression get the best of me,” DeRozan tweeted in February. 
A week later, the 29-year-old former Trojan did an interview with the Toronto Star detailing his struggles. 
“It’s one of them things that no matter how indestructible we look like we are, we’re all human at the end of the day,” DeRozan said. “We all got feelings . . . all of that. Sometimes . . . it gets the best of you, times where everything in the whole world’s on top of you.”
As a sports fan, it’s sometimes difficult to imagine some of these superstars you look up to feel vulnerable. Yet, right in front of us, some of the biggest stars in the NBA are revealing their struggles.
The pathway to becoming a professional sports athlete is a long and strenuous one that takes a lot of dedication and a lot of pure physical ability. However, to make it to the NBA, or the NFL, or the MLB, must have tremendous physical ability, while also having fantastic mentality. 
That’s what makes players like Love and DeRozan standout that much more. Love pointed out that some nights before games, he would think about the worst things that have happened to him over the past decade. He would spend more time with a negative mentality than with a positive mentality. Yet, he was able to not only compete each night, but also play at an All-Star level for most of his career.
Some people will call Love and DeRozan soft for the rest of their careers. Some people will never understand their struggling with such issues. After watching Love’s interview and reading MacMullan’s article, my perception of Love couldn’t have changed more. I went from thinking of Love as LeBron’s sidekick to realizing that he is one of the toughest and most talented guys in the entire league.
While Love and DeRozan have great mindsets, they over-analyze their bad performances more than any other athletes because of their struggles. Over-thinking is a great motivator sometimes, but it can also take over someone’s life.
The NBA is a tough league known for great trash talking. Love and DeRozan just exposed themselves and opened themselves up to great amounts of it. People now think they can get inside their heads and call them soft or weak. 
But at the end of the day, there is nothing soft about them. They’ve overcome struggles to continue playing basketball. They’ve been forced to put up with that fight everyday. These challenges are certainly exhausting. While it may get to the best of them, like it did with Love last year against the Hawks, on most occasions they win the battle and are able to play basketball at an elite level without us seeing the brutal fight constantly occurring in their heads.

The Trojan football team has been hit with its fair share of injuries over the last few weeks as training camp has nearly run its course. Although a number of important starters have missed time, they’ve been lucky enough to avoid any potential season ending injuries up to this point. Here are some of the players still out due to injury whose absence could affect the starting lineup in Week 1:
Porter Gustin 
Predator Linebacker
Gustin came into this offseason with enormous expectations, as one of the leaders of the team and one of its most talented members. However, the edge-rusher’s training camp was cut short by a meniscus tear three days in. Fortunately, Gustin’s injury doesn’t seem to be severe; coaches are optimistic that he could be ready to play by the opener against UNLV. In his absence, redshirt freshman Hunter Echols and redshirt junior Christian Rector have traded snaps at his spot with the first team. Look for both players, especially Echols, to spend time there if Gustin does miss games or has his workload managed.
Cameron Smith 
Inside Linebacker
The two-time team leader in tackles missed a majority of training camp due to what head coach Clay Helton described as a strained hamstring. All indications point to the injury being relatively mild, with the coaches repeatedly stipulating that Smith has been held out more for precautionary reasons than anything else. He’s been doing some drill work over the last week, and should be in line to make a full return this week. In Smith’s absence, junior Jordan Iosefa, the starter at outside linebacker opposite Porter Gustin, was moved into his “Mike” linebacker spot while freshman Kana’i Mauga assumed Iosefa’s position. At this point though, there’s no reason not to think Smith won’t be the one lining up in the center of the defense come Sept. 9.
Michael Pittman
Wide Receiver
After a breakout second half of last season and a tremendous offseason, Pittman is expected to be paired with redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns as the team’s two starting outside receivers. However, an AC joint sprain has kept him out of practice for the last week and a half. Redshirt sophomore Josh Imatorbhebhe filled in for him, until an ankle injury he suffered in the first scrimmage gave Amon-Ra St. Brown the opportunity to play there instead. Pittman should be a full-go at some point this week, and barring unforeseen complications, he should be starting Week 1 If his shoulder does continue to affect him, however, St. Brown has shown enough to warrant faith in him as a starting outside receiver.
Austin Jackson/Clayton Bradley  
Left Tackle
Bradley and Jackson have spent the whole offseason jockeying for the nod as the team’s starting left tackle, and it seemed like Jackson had earned the position before both players were left injured. Jackson has been held out with a rolled ankle while Bradley is dealing with a tweaked back. Both Jackson and Bradley should be healthy for the opener. In their absence, redshirt freshman Jalen McKenzie has taken the majority of snaps with the first team at left tackle.
Ykili Ross
Strong Safety
Ross was expected to compete for the starting strong safety position with sophomore Bubba Bolden before a hamstring issue knocked him out early in camp. His return timeline may be a bit more behind  senior Cameron Smith, who suffered a similar injury on the same day. However, he should be ready by the season. In his absence, Bolden has performed well with the first team, and it’s unlikely that Ross will supplant him immediately after returning. He could find his way into a role as a preferred backup however, spelling Bolden at times and stepping up in the case of an injury.
