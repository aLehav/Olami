Attendees of Friday’s inauguration ceremony said they enjoyed President C.L. Max Nikias’ speech for its inspiration, direction and representation of the university’s accomplishments and future.

Students said they were impressed by Nikias’ remarks and recognized the importance and uniqueness of the new presidency.
“It was really a celebration of the best and the brightest USC has produced and hopes to produce in the future,” said Olivia Gardner, a freshman majoring in biochemistry.
Students also said they were able to relate to Nikias and felt that he had an understanding of the goals and desires of the student body.
“It was a great opportunity for the whole community to show support for our new leader,” said Margaret Ivey, a senior majoring in theatre. “I loved what he had to say about uncertainty being the beginning of a new adventure. It resonated with me being a senior and going off on my own adventure soon.”
Rosezetta Upshaw, a third-year graduate student studying law, said she valued Nikias’ vision for USC and welcomed his embrace of the entire USC community.
“His speech was great. It sounded like he really had a plan for USC and our future,” Upshaw said. “As a Berkeley alum, this is the first time I truly feel caught up in the Trojan spirit.”
Faculty and staff applauded Nikias’ plan to continue to uphold USC’s long-standing traditions, while simultaneously leading USC into a new era.
“He inspired a high-level goal, very far reaching and demanding. If we strive toward that goal we will be a better faculty and a better school,” said Ted Berger, professor of biomedical engineering.
At the same time, faculty and staff said they appreciated Nikias’ understanding of the adversities the university is encountering in the wake of the global financial crisis.
“The remarks were very enlightening,” said Tom Wright, a laboratory supervisor on the Health Sciences Campus. “He seems to have a very enlightened perspective of the global economy and the future of the university.”
Nikias stressed the importance of the school adapting to the globalizing and evolving world, which Kimberly Freeman, a part-time professor at the School of Policy, Planning, and Development, said she found inspirational.
“The president’s remarks about where the school is located allow the school to improve in a globalized way. The school can’t afford to not have an eye on its international opportunities,” Freeman said.
Alumni said they respected Nikias’ recognition of former President Steven B. Sample’s achievements and admired Nikias’ goal to integrate Sample’s accomplishments into his own vision.
“It was very nice that Dr. Nikias mentioned how much Sample had done and that he is going to build on that,” said Marilyn Kezirian, an alumna who received her bachelor’s degree in 1960.
For some alumni, such as Meredith Drake, an alumna from the class of 2010, Nikias brought new light to the school’s figurehead and deeply rooted traditions.
“His speech was incredibly inspiring. He weaved classic Greek tragedies into contemporary traditions,” Drake said. “Tommy Trojan is a mascot, but you rarely get the opportunity to really think about it as a deep symbol of the university that could inspire people.”
Nikias’ emphasis on the Trojan Family  and fostering of individual successes also struck the attention of Peter Kezirian, an alumnus of the Gould School of Law class of 1989.
“It reflected the magic that USC has a strong sense of community and it also stressed the individual as a leader in the immediate community and globally,” Kezirian said. “The blending of the individual and community is uniquely USC.”

President C.L. Max Nikias was sworn into office Friday morning, during a ceremony that brought together Trojans both young and old to celebrate the 11th USC presidential inauguration.

Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
“Today, we live in a time of great anxiety. The wisest experts cannot find an agreement on what the future holds for our society,” Nikias said. “Education is what helps us to be fully human and to appreciate the full range of human experience.”
The ceremony began with processions from members of the USC community, including student delegates, half-century Trojan alumni, staff and parents. Third-graders from the Lenicia B. Weemes Elementary School also marched in the ceremony.
Faculty from every school in the university processed to the stage in Alumni Park, followed by Nikias, his wife, Niki Nikias, and their daughters, Georgiana and Maria.
Edward P. Roski Jr., chairman of the USC Board of Trustees, officiated the ceremony.
“This inauguration you’re about to witness is truly an historic occurrence. It’s only happened 10 times in the last 130 years,” he said. “The last time we saw a new president, there was no one texting during the ceremony or taking pictures with their cell phones. We didn’t have cell phones.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Chris Cheng and Graduate and Professional Student Senate President Jenny Novak made remarks as well, commemorating Nikias for his efforts to connect with students.
“We promise to work with you to take our innovation beyond the lab and the studio,” Novak said. “To make a difference in the communities we call home, starting right here at USC where we will shape this campus into a dynamic residential community.”
The university hosted John Hood, the former vice chancellor of Oxford University, who spoke about Nikias’ accomplishments and his journey to become president of USC.
“I assure you, it is USC’s essential character — today and in the future — that has been consuming President Nikias’ thinking and that will guide his collegiate agenda,” Hood said.
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the university played a key part in the history and culture of the city.
“When you see the procession of flags come through as they did a few minutes ago, it is not hyperbolic to say this is a city where the world comes together,” Villaraigosa said.
After former President Steven B. Sample inaugurated Nikias, fireworks launched from behind the stage to commemorate Sample’s passing of the University Medallion. The new president then gave a speech about his journey to USC and his vision for the future.
“As a child, I grew up reading the various legends of the ancient city of Troy,” Nikias said. “No one worked harder than the Trojans, no one was more determined than the Trojans. And their will toward greatness could even bend the will of the gods in their favor.”
The history of the Trojans in ancient civilization was a foreshadowing of the Trojans’ strength today, he said.
“Troy would grow into the great city of Rome. Rome — the home of the mightiest and the most enduring of all empires,” he said. “That was the destiny that Trojans began to claim.”
The future of the university, he said, lies in the intellectual potential of students and the rich cultural environment surrounding USC. Nikias said one of his plans was to make the Health Sciences Campus as residential and bustling as the University Park Campus.
“My own commitment to you is to run the next marathon at a sprinter’s pace,” Nikias said. “We can make incredible progress in just the next few years.”
Though Nikias said there was no way to anticipate the future landscape of higher education, he was sure USC would serve as an “intellectual crucible” in the years to come.
“Consider the voyage that still lies ahead,” he said. “Uncertainty is the beginning of adventure.”
At the end of the inauguration, Trustee Ming Hsieh announced a $50 million gift to the university to go toward cancer research. The Annenberg Foundation will also donate $50 million to build a new building for the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.

You don’t have to hop on a plane to Penny Lane, Abbey Road or Strawberry Fields to get your John Lennon fix, thanks to the “John Lennon, Songwriter” exhibit now open at L.A. Live’s Grammy Museum.
The collection includes items ranging from Lennon’s original handwritten lyrics to a pair of his signature wire-rimmed glasses and exclusive interviews with widow Yoko Ono.
Visitors can get an interactive experience at the Beatles-era mixing console where musically inclined (or not) Lennon lovers can add their vocals to hits like “Beautiful Boy” and “Give Peace a Chance.”
On the way out, museum goers (including Ono herself) share their hopes and dreams for a better tomorrow on cards with the pre-printed phrase, “Imagine a world…”  Many draw peace signs, hearts and jot down popular refrains like “All you need is love.”  Others share specific dreams of equality for people of different sexual orientations and socioeconomic statuses.
In distinctly elementary school penmanship, one child writes, “Lennon lives on.”  With this exhibit, he does.
The exhibit — which opened Oct. 4 in anticipation of what would have been Lennon’s 70th birthday on Oct. 9 — runs until March 2011.

Senior Zsofia Erdelyi led the USC women’s cross-country team to a third-place finish at Saturday’s Cal State Northridge Invitational by claiming first place overall in the 6K race in Van Nuys, Calif.

Erdelyi’s fifth career first-place finish came in relatively easy fashion, as the senior standout crossed the finish line more than eight seconds ahead of her closest competitor. Erdelyi took the overall lead with just more than a mile to go before cruising the rest of the way.
“It definitely looked pretty easy for her,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “I was happy with the way she picked it up in the second half of the race and finished strong. There’s definitely more in her than there was at this time last year.”
The race represented a strong team performance by the Women of Troy, as the squad’s second and seventh runners finished only 35 seconds apart. Ironically, Erdelyi was the only runner of those seven for USC who failed to record a personal best time on Saturday.
“I always say you’re only as good as your fifth or sixth runner,” Walsh said. “We wanted to make sure we closed the gaps between our runners and we did a good job of that on Saturday.”
Senior Christine Cortez bested her personal record by 20 seconds and finished second for the Women of Troy and fourth overall. Junior Leah Gaeta followed Cortez with a 12th place finish, with senior Dina Kitayama close behind in 18th place.
Senior Zara Lukens rounded out USC’s scoring runners by finishing 25th overall. Junior Jessica Lundin and sophomore Kelly Owen came in 27th and 33rd, respectively.
Walsh had set a goal for his team to finish in second place at the meet. The Women of Troy fell just short of that goal with 56 points, one more than second-place Cal State Fullerton and 14 more than meet winner UC Riverside.
“That was the only disappointment I had,” Walsh said of the near second-place finish. “It ended up being a matter of one [individual] place. Overall, I thought we competed very well.”
USC will next compete at the Titan Invitational in Fullerton, Calif., before heading north to run in the Pac-10 championships in Seattle, Wash. The Women of Troy’s early-season success has their coach thinking the team could surprise when the runners toe the line in Seattle.
“We’ve had two good races in a row,” Walsh said. “We’re bringing in a lot more momentum to the Pac-10s than we have the past couple of years. We’ve stayed healthy, and that’s given us a chance to be successful.”

The gloomy weather in Southern California followed the Women of Troy up to Oregon as they struggled to string together any consistent play over the weekend.
Overlooked · Senior defender Karter Haug and USC struggled early against Oregon State and could not rebound, losing the match 1-0. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
Facing the Oregon State Beavers (10-1-1, 2-0-0) to kick off their road trip, the Women of Troy (8-4-2, 1-2-0) came out lethargic and couldn’t recover, falling 1-0.
“The first half, we were just casual observers in the game and it took us [until] halftime to figure out what Oregon State was doing,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said.
The second half would prove to be much better as the team picked up its intensity and started to play with more energy, rattling off 10 shots on goal.
To its misfortune, none of the shots would fall as Oregon State Beaver goalkeeper Colleen Boyd denied shot after shot. Though the Women of Troy were on the attack constantly, it was Beavers forward Chelsea Buckland who found the back of the net in the 83rd minute of regulation, giving her team a 1-0 lead and the victory.
“I think today we might have underestimated them and we came out really flat,” said senior defender Karter Haug. “It was a hard loss to take, but hopefully our team can learn from this and bounce back.”
In the second game of their road trip, against the Oregon Ducks (4-7-3, 0-2-1), the Women of Troy (8-4-3, 1-2-1) managed to play to a 1-1 tie.
“We knew this game was going to be tough [because] Oregon hung with UCLA,” redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval said. “We knew we needed to play smarter and more tougher.”
In the first half against Oregon, a slow start plagued the Women of Troy again. The Ducks managed to strike first in the game, scoring in the 30th minute of the game when forward Jen Stoltenberg knocked in for her 10th goal of the season.
“We need to figure out how we can begin the game with more urgency and that seems to be the biggest obstacle for this team right now,” coach Khosroshahin said.
Despite multiple corner kicks and other opportunities on goal, the Women of Troy couldn’t find the back of the net in the first half and went into halftime trailing 1-0.
Going into the second half, the Women of Troy picked up their play. In the 69th minute, a foul on goalkeeper Lindsay Parlee gave the team a penalty kick. Haug shot wide right, however, and the score remained 1-0.
But the Women of Troy would get another opportunity in the 81st minute when they were awarded another penalty kick — this time, Sandoval found the back of the net, knotting the game up at 1-1.
The goal left the Women of Troy with a loss and a tie over the weekend, but despite the results Khosroshahin is encouraged by the team’s development.
“A loss and a tie isn’t what we hoped for, but it was a necessary experience to face two tough opponents in our conference,” he said. “Our team is growing and we still are learning, and as long as we’re learning and figuring stuff out, I think we’ll be fine.”

With seven teams ranked in the top 25 entering play this weekend, it is clear the Pac-10 is a hard conference to play in. Coming away with conference victories can be quite difficult, even against those few unranked teams.
Misfire · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter (pictured here against Cal) and USC committed 31 unforced errors against Arizona State in the loss. - Jesse Bowman | Daily Trojan 
The No. 5 Women of Troy learned that lesson Friday, as they lost to Arizona State 3-1 in four sets, 29-27, 25-23, 14-25, 25-23. The Sun Devils had lost 28 straight matches to USC prior to this weekend but were able to come away with the victory on a night when USC committed a season-high 31 hitting errors.
Many of these errors were charged to junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter and freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana.
“They made unforced error after unforced error,” said USC coach Mick Haley. “If they don’t stop doing that, we’re not going to be able to get better.”
Fonoimoana did finish with a season-high 20 kills, but she and Jupiter combined for 17 errors on the night.
One major factor Haley attributed as a potential source for his team’s somewhat ineffective execution was the team’s travel schedule.
“I think we’re not going to be able to go in and play on the same day that we travel because they’re just too young yet. They can’t get that right yet,” Haley said. “I pretty much have to take the blame for that little bit.”
After suffering an upsetting defeat on a night when Haley described his team as being “in a fog” for most of the match, the Women of Troy did not have much time to hang their heads, as they had to face No. 25 Arizona in Tucson on Saturday.
Fortunately, the Women of Troy were not eager to let one loss turn into two, and prepared themselves for a tough match.
“A good night [of] sleep and a chance to clear our heads made a lot of difference,” Haley said.
After dropping the first set 19-25, the Women of Troy woke up, taking the next two sets, 25-17 and 25-18, and eventually edging out the win against the Wildcats.
“When we lost that first game, we really weren’t playing, but the second game [USC] really took charge,” Haley said. “I thought we got tired in the fourth, so that kind of caused some concern, but really, the fifth game was a well-played game on our part and gave me a lot of hope that we’re still improving.”
USC ended up winning the match in five sets (19-25, 25-17, 25-18, 21-25, 18-16). It was the first time the Women of Troy had won in Tucson in three years.
“We passed so much better,” Haley said, when comparing Saturday’s match to Friday’s. “We had over 40 sets to the middle tonight … [and] took a lot of pressure off of [outside hitter Katie] Fuller and the outside.”
Junior middle blocker Lauren Williams hit .565 and recorded 13 kills, while freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard had 10 kills and a hitting percentage of .435. Both had no errors.
As this weekend proved to the Women of Troy, making it through the Pac-10 schedule is not going to be easy. All the team can really do to prepare is return to the daily grind of practice and work to become even more disciplined.
“We’ll continue to focus on our passing and continue to improve on our aggressive serving,” Haley said. “Keep working hard. Keep improving.”

The story: The Trojans rebound from two consecutive last-second losses with a 48-14 romp of California at the Coliseum.
The Golden Bears’ defense entered the game as one of the best in the nation and the best in the Pac-10, but it didn’t look the part on Saturday.
Early impact · Freshman wide receiver Robert Woods had yet another standout game, catching seven passes for 116 yards and two touchdowns. The first-year starter has been a consistent threat for the Trojans. - TIm Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans exploded for 602 yards and 42 first-half points, continuing their stellar offensive play. USC gained 391 of those yards in the air against Cal’s sixth-ranked pass defense that was allowing only 148.8 yards a game.
Meanwhile, USC dominated on defense for the first time this year. It was a statement game after two straight weeks where the defense gave up late drives that ended in losses. Cal gained 245 total yards, the majority coming against the Trojan backups.
Player of the game: Matt Barkley. The sophomore quarterback logged his second five-touchdown pass performance of the season (the first was against Hawai’i). Barkley was 25-of-37 for 352 yards with no interceptions.
“As a team, from offense to defense, I think we played our most complete game,” Barkley said. “It was really good to see everyone in each phase of the game on point.”
Freshman wide receiver Robert Woods hauled in two Barkley touchdowns, as did senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson. Senior wide receiver David Ausberry caught one.
For the second time this season, Barkley tied the single-game USC record for touchdown passes in a game.
He had a chance to break it on USC’s second drive of the third quarter. Barkley completed a pass to Woods near the goal line and Woods extended for the pylon but came up just short. After a delay of game penalty, Barkley took three shots to the end zone but came up empty.
USC coach Lane Kiffin said there was a concerted effort to get Barkley the record.
“Yeah, I was just tired of it being tied,” Kiffin said. “One of these days we’re going to break it.”
You knew it was over when: With USC already up 35-0 late in the first half, redshirt junior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris intercepted a pass from Cal quarterback Kevin Riley and returned it to the Cal 26-yard line. With 26 seconds remaining, the Trojans could have sat on their comfortable lead.
Instead, they kept their foot on the accelerator and completed their dominant half with yet another touchdown, an 11-yard pass from Barkley to Johnson.
Play of the game: Harris’ interception. Not only did the defensive tackle confirm the thrashing, but he also showed he has decent hands.
Riley tried to sneak a screen past Harris, but the 6-foot-4, 305-pound former high school tight end reached out and caught the ball like a receiver.
“I’ve still got good hands,” Harris said. “I haven’t caught a ball since high school.”
Getting defensive (finally): USC’s defense has been heavily criticized for its play this season. It gave up huge chunks of yards against Hawai’i, Washington and Stanford, and it was helpless to stop late drives the last two weeks that set up two heartbreaking endings.
This week, it came full circle. The defense was nearly perfect in the first half, shutting out the Bears while giving up just 64 yards.
The Trojans forced two turnovers (sophomore safety T.J. McDonald got the other interception) and sacked Riley twice.
The defense was fed up with their critics.
“We take that personal,” McDonald said.
So what changed? Nothing scheme-wise, according to McDonald. The Trojans were just in better position.
“We just were able to get lined up and play,” he said.
The what-ifs: After such an emphatic performance, it’s worth mentioning that the Trojans could easily have been undefeated heading into their bye week and then their home showdown with No. 1 Oregon.
If a few plays had gone differently in the previous two weeks, USC could be sitting pretty at 6-0. The Trojans showed how good they can be when their defense plays well.
“I think all three games [Washington, Stanford and Cal] are exactly the same except for one thing: We played really good defense in one of the three,” Kiffin said.
The downside: Reserve senior running back C.J. Gable left the game with a knee injury in the fourth quarter. Kiffin said Gable probably blew out his knee and would likely be out for the season.
“The kid walks by [after the game], can barely walk, and he says, ‘Coach I’m sorry I couldn’t finish today,’” Kiffin said. “That says a lot about him.”

When USC faltered a week ago on the road at Stanford, a multitude of issues plagued the Trojans in their 5-3 loss: inaccurate shooting, a lack of focus and an inability to contend with a more physical Cardinal team.
Seven days later, in a matchup with conference rival Cal, the inexperienced bunch shored up many of those lagging issues, but instead, new problems presented themselves, namely on the defensive end.
Just short · Junior driver Peter Kurzeka and USC went down 5-0 early to Cal and, despite a furious rally, could not come back. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
“We struggled with communication in defense, and [Cal’s] players did their job,” said junior goalie Joel Dennerley. “Every single one of our guys was making a mistake, and they capitalized on that.”
Trailing No. 2 California 8-2 at the end of the second quarter, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (15-2, 1-2) found itself in a widening hole against an offense that couldn’t miss, eventually falling 12-9 despite a late surge of their own.
“We just didn’t come out the way we should’ve,” said freshman driver Nikola Vavic. “We were ready, but things were just going their way. There wasn’t much we could do about it.”
While the offense sputtered in the early goings, Cal took advantage of a series of defensive miscues on behalf of the Trojans, working their way to a 5-0 lead before Vavic finally put the Trojans on the scoreboard with 28 seconds remaining in the first frame.
Yet, even with their limited offensive production, USC had an even greater difficulty stringing any goals together. Following Vavic’s goal, the Trojans turned the ball over on subsequent possessions, while the opposing Golden Bears made scoring look routine.
After it’s five-goal outburst in the first period, Cal continued its success, scoring three more goals before halftime to balloon its lead to a six-goal margin.
“They’re a good offensive team and have some good shooters, but for me, personally, it was a really disappointing game,” Dennerley said. “I let in some easy goals and it’s something I need to fix this week. It allowed them to get on a roll, and I take responsibility for this game in that regard.”
But Cal’s scoring shouldn’t come as a surprise, as it features two attackers in Ivan Rackov and Luka Saponjic, who presently rank among the leaders in scoring nationally.
“When you give them time and space, they’ll put their shots away,” Dennerley said. “It was good offense by them.”
Rackov made a point to let Dennerley know how proficient the Bears were offensively. Following his hat trick-clinching goal late in the second frame, Rackov pointed at the Trojans’ goalie, holding up three fingers and rotating them from side to side.
But Dennerley shrugged it off.
“I try not to worry about that,” he said. “Players just try to get a psychological advantage and will talk crap to you. He’s a good player and a good shooter. He’s always going to get goals and our job is to stop him. We didn’t do that.”
Luckily, the Trojans experienced a late scoring barrage of their own, to at least make the game competitive. Despite an 8-2 deficit at halftime, USC tallied seven second-half goals, with five coming in the fourth period.
“This was a team we beat before, so we know we can play against them,” Vavic said, who finished with three goals on the day. “So, in the second half, we just knew we had to relax. They were just getting some lucky plays here and there, and we weren’t.”
But as expected, such a lead was hard to overcome.
“This game was really important, but we still have a long way to go in the season,” Dennerley said. “Depending on how things go, we can still be on top come the end of the year. We just need to focus on preparing for next week and fixing what happened today.”

Prior to Saturday’s game, the month of October had not been kind to the Trojans’ status in the collegiate football world.
Between two heartbreaking field goals, a plethora of missed opportunities and all of the lost hype, the Trojans found themselves tied for seventh place in the Pac-10 and sitting on the national media’s back burner with little momentum and even less to play for — at least in a tangible way.
It didn’t help that Saturday’s matchup against California — another team struggling to find its stride — showed little prospect in its own right; a win for the favored Trojans would be expected, and a loss would just continue the downward spiral for a program burdened with seemingly never-ending hardship.
The Trojans not only responded to the adversity, but took their small opportunity against the Golden Bears and turned it into an audible message that had not been heavily broadcast yet this season — “We are still here.”
In a flash of brilliance from both the offense and defense, USC turned Saturday’s matchup into a punishing release of pent-up energy, frustration and desire, pummeling a helpless Cal team so handily that it took two hands to count the Trojans’ first-half touchdowns.
The sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley-led offense, containing one of the most dynamic players in college football in freshman phenom wide receiver Robert Woods, continued to light up the scoreboard, but it was the defensive effort that headlined the performance. The unit held Cal to three first downs in the first half, intercepted Cal quarterback Kevin Riley twice and posted its first first-half shutout of the season.
Even the special teams joined the party, as senior kicker Joe Houston — who has been much maligned through the first six games — nailed both of his field goal attempts from 27 yards, and coverage teams blanketed the field and took away any chance for the Golden Bears to gain momentum.
For Trojan fans, there’s probably no way to sum it up better than USC sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard did: “It felt good.”
But good feelings and a sense of relief are not all that came out of USC’s win Saturday. The game presented a fork in the road for both teams, and the Trojans proved that they were not going to settle for taking the same path to the land of obscurity and five-win seasons as their ailing opponent.
I don’t want to call it a statement win. At a time of absolute turmoil for a football program steeped in tradition and a winning history, this was more than that. It was a game that will help define what the coming years will be like for a team that has hardly looked like the Trojans that won two (one according to the NCAA) national championships since 2000.
You might be thinking I’m putting too much weight on a simple win over our perennial second-in-line punching bag to the north (don’t worry Washington State, you are still No. 1), but to fully understand the situation for the Trojans, an examination of the conference status quo is necessary.
USC is no longer the king of the Pac-10. Even if Trojan fans could still find an argument for that point after going 9-4 last season, it was all but squashed in the first two weeks of October. And with the coup d’état has come a bum-rush of contenders all looking to pounce on the opportunity to find their place at the top.
Add the fact that USC is an ineligible contender for the next two seasons, and it’s easy to see how the guys on College Football Live could forget about the Trojans and the dynasty that once existed in the late 2000s.
Yes, after losing to Washington and Stanford, USC has only a glimmer of hope to take first place in the Pac-10 this season. But the difference between finishing in third place and eighth place is everything the Trojans have left to play for — to prove that, although the style of play has changed, the foundations of a great team have not.
With the new caravan of coaches and players coming in, 2010 represented a potential schism between the Trojans of last decade and the present team. In rebounding from two tough losses to beat conference foe Cal, especially in the manner they did, a connection was established with the success of the past. The Trojans showed that they still have the necessary tools to remain the team they once were, even if they must simultaneously deal with a monumental program shakeup.
It was only one win. Still, a loss Saturday could have sealed a disastrous downfall for USC’s coaching, recruiting and national relevance — the key ingredients that have made Trojan football what it is today.
Fortunately, instead of allowing that to happen, coach Lane Kiffin and the Trojans decided somewhere around 12:30 p.m. Saturday that it was time to pay homage to the last decade of USC football.

It had all the markings of a game from a previous era. The blowout, the sacks, the big plays and the USC football team huddled in a circle dancing up and down after scoring its sixth touchdown — in the first half.
Handing out points · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley (7) hands off to junior tailback Marc Tyler. Barkley, with 352 yards passing and five touchdowns, led a Trojan offense that jumped to a 42-0 lead before halftime that all but sealed the victory over Cal in the Coliseum. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Everything was going so well that half of the Song Girls took a few plays off at the beginning of the second half to fix their makeup.
USC (5-2, 2-2) demolished a Cal (3-3, 1-2) team 48-14 that was coming off a big win over UCLA in a game attended by far less than the announced attendance of 72,386 at the Coliseum.
Though the offense put up 602 yards, the defense stole the show.
“We finally played our style of defense,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It was great to see, especially with Malcolm Smith out and not playing. We had guys step up and performing.”
It’s no secret that the defense has played far below expectations thus far this season, but it found its heartbeat Saturday.
The defense didn’t allow a first down until two minutes and 45 seconds into the second quarter and forced four three-and-outs, which is two more than it forced that last two games combined.
“We knew we weren’t playing well [this year],” sophomore safety T.J. McDonald said. “We had a lot of trouble in the past on third and fourth down getting off the field and we put ourselves in good situations today with third and long.” 
From the first snap, the defense looked like the unit of old. Defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin was calling more blitzes on first and second down than he’s done this year and the defensive line was stopping the Cal running game and forcing Cal quarterback Kevin Riley to beat them with his arm, which he didn’t do.
“We knew that if we could make them one-dimensional and get them in situations like that, we would capitalize on that. When they start throwing they can’t really be themselves,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “The pressure we got with the D-line was great.”
USC finished with six tackles for loss, two sacks and two interceptions, including one by redshirt junior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris as he snuffed out a screen pass with 43 seconds left in the first half.
“We had a defensive line slant and they let me through,” Harris said. “Something didn’t feel right and I saw the quarterback throw it and it went in slow motion. I was like, ‘No way.’”
That interception led to sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley’s fifth and last touchdown of the day as he found senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson in the front corner of the end zone on an 11-yard pass with eight seconds to spare.
That put USC up 42-0 at the half.
As the halftime score showed, the offense picked up right where it left off last weekend in Stanford. USC scored six touchdowns in its first seven drives and only punted the ball once all day — when it was up 7-0 in the first quarter.
With freshman tailback Dillon Baxter out and senior running back Allen Bradford operating at 80 percent according to Kiffin, the onus was on the passing game.
“We put the game on Matt [Barkley] like we did last week and Matt, [freshman receiver Robert Woods] and [Johnson], the three of them responded,” Kiffin said.
Barkley shredded the sixth-ranked passing defense in the nation, throwing for 352 yards and five touchdowns, all to Johnson and Woods.
Johnson caught seven passes for 45 yards and two touchdowns, but it was Woods who led the Trojans in receiving for the second week in a row. He had seven receptions for 116 yards and two touchdowns as he topped the 100-yard receiving mark for the second time in as many weeks.
“He’s [former USC wide receiver] Stevie Smith, but he’s faster,” Kiffin said. “He’s put together two big games and really played great when we’ve given him a chance. We just didn’t do a good job earlier in the year giving him the ball.”
With the offense operating at a high level, and the defense playing well this week, the Trojans look to be in good shape as they hit the bye week before welcoming No. 1 Oregon to the Coliseum in two weeks. For the defense to perform well, sometimes it’s just about getting back to basics.
“We were able to just line up on the field and play,” McDonald said. “No shifting or anything. We’ve been able to do what we’ve been doing since we were little. It was a lot of fun.”
FIGHT ON!!! Beat the Ducks!!
When my dad was alive, he would walk out in disgust and trim the roses whenever SC fumbled, was penalized when the Trojans were driving or stopping an opponant’s drive, or a vital pass was dropped.  He had a bunch of well-trimmed roses.  John McKay used to downplay the importance of emotion in a football game but if we use “intensity” instead, well, intensity can mean focus, greater quickness off a snap, and, once again, blocking and tackling with a little meaning on the side.  On Saturday, SC played with intensity against Cal, and dad would have stayed the game.  Welcome home, Trojans.
Nice win for the team.

Many collegiate basketball programs celebrate the beginning of fall basketball practice by packing thousands of students into their stadium for Midnight Madness festivities.
The first official USC basketball practice Friday, on the other hand, was only witnessed by a handful of media members, scouts and university officials as a result of the Trojans’ new stricter basketball practice admittance policy.
Though there may not have been a lot of fanfare at USC’s first practice, the Trojans started off the season with an intense and productive three-hour practice.
“I thought they did a great job today,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We were able to get a lot of stuff in. For a first practice I thought it was really, really good.”
USC will be eligible for postseason play this year, after self-imposing a postseason ban on the basketball program last season, stemming from a violation of NCAA rules. As a result, the players are competing for more than just pride this season.
“Everyone seemed pretty hungry,” sophomore forward Evan Smith said. “Everyone got after it and played physical. We had a lot of great competition.”
Friday was the first official practice for USC’s four freshman. O’Neill’s initial freshman recruiting class, which includes guards Maurice Jones and Bryce Jones, and forwards Garrett Jackson and Curtis Washington, will make the team quicker than last year’s squad.
“We had a bunch of guys that overachieved last year and showed strong character,” O’Neill said. “I hope that carries over to this year’s group, which has a little more speed, quickness and talent.”
Many of the Trojans appeared to be stronger and in better shape than they had been last season, thanks to Shaun Brown, first-year strength and conditioning manager.
“Shaun Brown has whipped us into shape,” Smith said. “He has gotten us to the point where we can play up to the level that coach expects us to. It will really pay off at end-of-the-game situations. We want to put in the work necessary to win.”
The speed of the team, combined with the inside presence of forwards senior Alex Stepheson and junior Nikola Vucevic, will shape the style of the team.
“The No. 1 thing we are going to have to do well is to play well defensively,” O’Neill said. “I think we are also going to be a good running team. I think that [point guards] Maurice Jones and Jio [Fontan] will make us a much better up-tempo and fast-breaking team than we were last year.”
The Trojans will hold the Cardinal & Gold Scrimmage on Oct. 23 at 12:30 p.m. at the Galen Center.
Is that sexy Lil Romeo still on your team?
Or did he get kicked off the team?
He needs the love of a strong sexy sista.
Is this Trojan team on probation too?

Despite the clouds covering the city Friday evening, it was a star-studded night in Los Angeles for the Democratic Party.
California gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown spoke at UCLA with just a few weeks to go before the Nov. 2 election, bringing with him some of the state’s and nation’s most prominent Democrats: Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, San Francisco Mayor and candidate for state lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom and former President Bill Clinton.

The rally was one of many stops high-profile Democrats have made across the country in recent weeks in an attempt to drum up support for the party.
“Are we going to take back California?” Villaraigosa yelled to an already-screaming crowd as the other Democrats took the stage shortly after 8 p.m.
The three spent about an hour speaking to thousands of listeners gathered in UCLA’s Dickson Court, trading compliments and slamming their opponents in an effort to rally a higher youth turnout on Nov. 2.
“It is not enough to have voted for a new president if you will not help him govern and stick behind the members of Congress who stood for him,” Clinton said. “What you must do is pick leaders who know how to be both frugal and in the future business. You’ve got to put California back in the future business.”
The future was a common theme throughout the evening, as all three men spoke to interests particular to a college-aged audience: the environment, the economy and education.
A product of the University of California system himself, Brown emphasized the need for public higher education to be available to all students, regardless of their backgrounds.
“[We need to] get every kid in this school that can qualify,” Brown said. “Everyone. Whether they’re documented or not.”
Clinton emphasized the importance of green technologies in revitalizing California’s economy, saying both Brown and Newsom would continue their support of such technologies, unlike their opponents.
Clinton alluded to Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman and her proposal to suspend AB 32  — a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions —  until the state unemployment rate drops.
“You stick with this greenhouse gas commitment you got; don’t you repeal that,” Clinton said. “It is the key to your economic future.”
The best place for California’s future, Newsom and Clinton said, is in Brown’s hands.
“We are lucky in this state,” Newsom said. “Jerry Brown has nothing to prove to anybody. He was twice governor of our great state, he has held every key office, he has accomplished more than folks like me could every dream of. But he’s willing to take the years where he could be writing a memoir and instead, he’s going to be writing the future of our great state.”
“One thing you can count on: I’m not writing any damn memoir,” Brown said, to laughter and cheers from the crowd.
Brown has been a political opponent to both Newsom and Clinton during his years as a politician; he opposed Clinton in the 1992 presidential primary and ran against Newsom in the Democratic primary for governor — during which Clinton endorsed Newsom.
Their past differences were put aside on Friday, however, as the three sought to get a bigger message across to the audience: Young voters need to show up on Nov. 2.
“I’ve lived my life. It’s been great. I just want you to have the same chances I did,” Clinton said. “I am pleading with you; you need to go out and tell everyone who is not here tonight that any college student in the state of California that doesn’t vote in this election is committing malpractice on your own future.”
Clinton’s appearance at UCLA — along with President Barack Obama’s upcoming visit to USC on Friday — sends a strong message to student voters, said Aaron Perman, a senior majoring in business administration who is the vice president of USC College Democrats.
“The college demographic is a lot of what drove Obama to win and was the backbone of the volunteer effort,” said Perman, who attended the rally at UCLA. “I think it’s recognizing that and recognizing that students still have a lot of things to care about. It shows students, ‘Hey, you really can make a difference.’”
Michael Maulano, a junior majoring in political science and finance director of the College Democrats who also attended Friday’s event, agreed.
“It’s an extremely important election for youth,” he said. “The problems facing the country and the issues we face today are certainly not going to wait. They’re going to affect us for a long time.”

Amid the pomp and circumstance that took place at the inauguration of President C.L. Max Nikias on Friday came the announcements of two major donations to the university.
Two members of the USC Board of Trustees donated a total of $100 million toward university advancement. Ming Hsieh presented a $50 million gift to fund a permanent endowment supporting research and development in nanomedicine for cancer. In return, the university plans to create the USC Ming Hsieh Institute for Research on Engineering-Medicine for Cancer.
“With this extraordinary gift, Ming Hsieh joins USC as a partner in the fight against cancer,” Nikias said in a press release. “What is exciting about the USC Ming Hsieh Institute is that it bridges our two campuses. This kind of creative collaboration is our best hope for dealing with this devastating disease.”
In Nikias’ inauguration speech, he said one of his top five priorities for the university is to unite the community under one identity in order to increase excellence and research.
“Our Health Sciences Campus and the University Park Campus represent one unified USC. Though they are seated at different ends of Downtown Los Angeles, they must have one character and one shared identity,” Nikias said. “Let’s make no mistake about it: When it comes to doing good for the world, we believe there is a USC way of doing it. … We must place this USC stamp on the intellectual and social revolutions that lie ahead.”
The USC Ming Hsieh Institute will advance nanotechnology in the realm of cancer research by bringing together USC’s world-class engineers from the Viterbi School of Engineering with scientists and physicians from the Keck School of Medicine and the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, Hsieh said in a press release.
“It’s my hope that their efforts will lead to better survival rates, longer remissions, new treatments and cures for this horrible disease that leaves an indelible mark on so many,” he said.
Hsieh, a USC alumnus, has contributed about $85 million to the university in the last five years.
Edward P. Roski Jr., chairman of the Board of Trustees, announced the donation of an additional $50 million from the Annenberg Foundation during the inauguration ceremony. The gift will go toward construction of a new state-of-the-art building for the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism on the University Park campus.
“This gift opens new frontiers and dramatically accelerates the school’s progress,” Annenberg Dean Ernest Wilson wrote in an e-mail to Annenberg students and faculty. “We plan for this cutting-edge building to serve the public interest as well with gathering spaces that encourage students, faculty, guest lecturers and members of our diverse local community to convene to share ideas and socialize.”
Preliminary plans for the new building, to be named Wallis Annenberg Hall after Wallis Annenberg, chairman of the Annenberg Foundation and the longest-serving member of the USC Board of Trustees, detail a 90,000 square foot, multi-story building with the latest technologies and equipment at the corner of McClintock Avenue and West 34th Street. A construction timeline has yet to be determined.
The Annenberg Foundation and Annenberg family have donated about $350 million since Walter H. Annenberg’s founding of the school in 1971.

It’s the usual story. A band starts off with a dream in mind, rehearses for hours, lands a few gigs and hopes to catapult to stardom.
Big time · Studies Have Shown... is the band’s first album. - Photo courtesy of Moving Picture Show 
Moving Picture Show took the same trajectory as dozens of bands before them, playing show after show in locations spanning from USC’s very own Ground Zero Performance Café at a Haiti benefit concert to the White Eagle Café and Saloon in Portland, Ore.
Add to its list of accomplishments a coveted spot on KROQ’S Locals Only show hosted by Kat Corbett as well as a track on Rock Band, and the band now has solid ground to get its career running.
And all of this comes before the official release of its debut album.
For Matt Kap (vocals/guitar), Jeremy Nesse (bass) and Scott Manley (drums), the album, Studies Have Shown…, drops not only for the enjoyment of waiting fans but will also reveal whether this rapid preliminary success comes with true merit. It will ultimately show whether the trio can stay strong with the critical ears of radio waves and music fans. Are they ready for the blazing lights of bigger venues?
Certain tracks on the album leave the listener with some uncertainty about the band’s personality. The album includes a soothing, heartfelt track, “By Now,” that is blended seamlessly with a radio-friendly chorus and a melancholic yet sweet tune.
To add to this commercial persona, the CD also includes a cover of the ’80s Peter Gabriel track “Games Without Frontiers,” complete with a confidently heavier sound and the repetition of the title in flowing French.
But what separates the band from the cliché act of covering a well-known song and following a popular song structure is its confidence even when playing quieter tracks. Though the album sometimes seems to delineate a band struggling to find its identity, several tracks shine through, proving that Moving Picture Show means serious business.
“Silent Types” starts off anything but silently. It begins with a cacophony of noise that nonchalantly nosedives into the calmness of guitar strings and a soft melody. This is perfectly paired by a characteristic experimentation with words that create lyrics that craftily express worn sentiments and repeated subject matter.
The angst and frustration over common things such as lost love remains intact in the tracks but the lyrics still stand out. Kap honestly relates the complication of speaking through simple lyrics, So the summer time / does the talking for us both / don’t start drama / drama could make me / choke on commas / I wanna say things.
An unexpectedly deep voice melded with the soft timbre of an acoustic guitar introduces “It’s Time to Get What You Want,” a melody characteristic of a Grey’s Anatomy soundtrack. The band continues to stray away from the usual as Kap proclaims the very existence of commonality, Fighting some cliché / but you’re still here fighting with the back of your mind / and everywhere you look / are enemy lines. A tambourine sounds launches the song into its full musical range while Kap sings Don’t you stand there / pretending everything’s fine.
Although sometimes overly preachy, the track again shows an attempt to hone in on complex emotions and get through to someone that just does not listen.
The pearl in the album comes in the track with the least appealing title. “Uhuh Uhuh” serves as the best example of the band and is a well-thought tune. It starts off with an inviting beat and an intriguingly distorted voice that instead of taking away from the lyrics helps add a good degree of emotion.
The “uhuh” in the background is merely a deep, almost indiscernible timbre. The trio’s penchant for heavy-sounding blues chords and dance influence shines through. The bass and drums keep the feet of listeners moving and Kap’s abandon helps add emotion to the song even in spots where the lyrics become blurred and difficult to capture.
The product is not perfect, but the effort is sincere. The lack of a self-conscious sound, the confidence of obliterating the ever-friendly appeal of Auto-Tune and the group’s cohesivesness show that the band has potential.
Like any band, the key lies in grasping this potential and grabbing the attention it is garnering in the ever-changing and fickle world of music and running with it.
So can Moving Picture Show hope for mainstream success with the pressure of following up their initial success and the appeal of their official album release? Does the CD show the guys advancing in the music world?
As Kap adds at the end of “Uhuh Uhuh,” “Yeah, something like that.”

You’ve probably never noticed food bloggers before.
But if you look around, they are everywhere — from fancy bistros, cafes and celebrity chef-owned restaurants to food festivals, food trucks and the latest hole-in-the-wall hot spots.
They lug their fancy DSLR cameras or whip out surreptitious iPhones, snapping away at anything and everything edible, from sloppy burgers to $48-per-plate meals the size of an ice cube.
And then, in their own private space, they type, upload and hit publish.
Love or hate them, food bloggers hold impressive clout within the foodie community. Imagine Anton Ego from Ratatouille, the feared pencil-nosed food critic with a pen sharper than his nose — except in this digital age, with the omnipotence of the Internet and fancy technology.
Within Los Angeles, we have our own share of food bloggers — average people who work stealthily to share their untrained-yet-passionate knowledge and experience in the craft of eating.
EATER LA
la.eater.com
Eater LA is the ultimate news feed for foodies. All the food-related news that’s fit to post, it will — preferably with a jab of snarky attitude.
It’s one of several sites on the Eater network, updating a dozen times a day with fresh content — from dining reviews, restaurant opening alerts and updates on food news and trends, to gossip about celebrity sightings in restaurants, discussion on Top Chef hosts and contestants, and a list of Eater’s favorite food-related articles around the Web.
The best thing about Eater LA is the sense of community. It’s proud to be an Angeleno blog and you feel it — loud and clear. A recent post sent out a cry of outrage about a Michelin guide director’s comment that “the people in Los Angeles are not real foodies.” The community joined together in denouncing the director’s claim.
Indeed, it is this infectious Angeleno pride enveloping the readers that leaves them with a happy buzz that cannot be achieved with just food.
QUARRYGIRL
quarrygirl.com
Who says vegans don’t eat well? Quarrygirl will dispel all misconceived ideas of morose carrot-munching vegans by seeking out the best vegan food — sometimes in unexpected places.
Besides the obvious vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Los Angeles, the author’s vegan horse isn’t too high for her to visit omnivorous restaurants as well, and that includes food trucks.
Drool as the author raves about food truck Fresh Fries’ hummus fancy fries, which are sweet potato fries topped with hummus, smoked paprika and sesame seeds, or about the luscious cupcakes from Babycakes.
Quarrygirl doesn’t make compromises — the blog is clear about its vegan principles, but that just means it is even more aggressive and passionate about sharing available vegan options to readers, be they the hardcore vegan or the curious omnivore.
MATTATOUILLE
mattatouille.com
It might be more accurate to call USC alumnus Matthew Kang a food writer, rather than a food blogger.
Kang doesn’t have a fancy camera; he shoots all his pictures with his trusty iPhone. Food porn isn’t the main draw of his blog, however. His words, which ooze with sensual hunger images, are more intense and tantalizing than any two-dimensional photograph could be.
Although Kang visits restaurants, snaps pictures and talks about his experience just like any other blogger, his prose reads like fiction — allowing his readers to experience his meals so they don’t leave hungry, but full of the tastes, smells and joys of the delicious experience he describes.
TEENAGE GLUSTER
teenageglutster.blogspot.com
Javier Cabral, the author of Teenage Glutster, is no longer a teenager. In fact, he turned 21 in January.
But Cabral has moved up the foodie ladder with great stride and already has his own full segment on the L.A. episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, a mention by The New Yorker and even a close brush with a several million-dollar lawsuit for blogging about his guest appearance on the second season of Hell’s Kitchen.
Mischief and antics aside, Cabral’s talent lies in wheedling out a hunger for inquisitive gastronomical romps from his readers while testing the limit of his speedy metabolism. You might see some fancy cocktail events on his blog, but you will mostly find him grubbing at unique places around the neighborhood, sometimes at ungodly hours.
As a second-generation Mexican-American, Cabral knows and delights in regional ethnic cuisines, especially those from his roots. His discovery of an Oaxacan restaurant called Moles La Tia in East Los Angeles (where he lives) turned the place into a foodie sensation, the restaurant was then also followed up by Pulitzer Prize-winning food guru Jonathan Gold.
MIDTOWN LUNCH
midtownlunch.com
Midtown Lunch is the broke college student’s ultimate guide to eating out. Founded by former New York resident Zach Brooks, the blog has now crept its way to other urban lunch spots in the nation, finally reaching Los Angeles this January.
You won’t see indulgent multi-coursed meals here — what ordinary person has time for that during their lunch break? Midtown Lunch does not waste calories on junk either. It deviates from generic chains or salad bars to inform its readers that yes, it is possible to get a good, cheap meal without resorting to Yoshinoya or wilted salads.
One particularly helpful method Midtown Lunch uses is a breakdown of its reviews using the “+” and “-” signs, essentially the pros and cons of each place. The “+” category is spoken as someone who loved the place, and the “-” of someone who disliked it, allowing the reader to see both perspectives.
The food blogging trend has taken off. Some people think food bloggers are just self-glorifying gluttons, while others believe they do a public service by providing free information and visceral foodie experiences. As long as there are hungry readers out there, however, food blogs are here to stay.

The 1960s weren’t all about psychedelics and hippies. The decade had a certain charm to it — magic that can be traced back to the emergence of the electric guitar.
Photo courtesy of MVD Entertainment Group
The guitar symbolized freedom and rebellion for a generation seeking to escape from the political and social unrest of its time. Through improvisation and experimentation, guitarists reached a sense of reality that Americans hungered to be a part of.
To this day, many people feel a mysterious desire to pick up a guitar and shred. Eric Clapton is one of the leading figures that brought the electric guitar to the forefront of  youth culture in the 1960s and was a huge innovator on how the instrument is played today. The documentary Eric Clapton: The 1960’s Review explores what the decade was like for the young guitarist and reveals the story behind his rise to fame.
The bulk of the documentary details Clapton’s involvement with The Yardbirds, John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers and Cream and Blind Faith. It was with these bands that Clapton built a huge following and was propelled into stardom. Clapton was always known for his virtuosity and fluid style, but throughout his career he struggled to find the right band to properly showcase his talents.
Is it possible to capture the energy and feeling of the 1960s in two hours? This documentary makes a valiant effort. Clapton’s story is told through interviews with former band members, experts on his career and of course the man himself. It features rare archived photos and footage of Clapton when he was just beginning to pursue music.
The documentary’s story isn’t anything new: it tells the tale of a musician just starting out, trying to make his way in the world. The movie shows Clapton at an early age, listening to records to try and find the sound he liked.
Yet, what makes the film unique is the man himself. Clapton’s musical history, from his raw talent with the guitar to his involvement in many influential bands of the 1960s,  makes the film intriguing. Were he a lesser musician, the movie might fail, but Clapton’s charisma carries the documentary, particularly his search for musical identity.
During this time, musicians with similar tastes were able to communicate with each other through the albums with which they were most passionate. Often the connection that musicians had through music they loved was the catalyst for starting their own bands. In this period of growth for Clapton, he was essentially picking up the influences that would later define his sound.
For Clapton, it was all about the blues.
Clapton was attracted to the purity of blues music from artists Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Robert Johnson, who provided the guitarist with the feeling he wanted to convey in his own way.
He dealt with many of the issues that plague musicians to this day. He had to find a way to buy a guitar, transport his equipment, find like-minded musicians to play with and figure out the best way to showcase his talents. Clapton was able to do this by joining what would become some of the most legendary bands of the generation.
Many people know Clapton from his hit songs, such as “Layla” and “I Shot the Sheriff.” What a lot of people might not know is that he didn’t start writing songs until later in his career. The 1960’s Review examines the very beginning of Clapton’s career as a guitarist, leading up to who he would eventually become.
Being such a blues purist, Clapton found himself bouncing from band to band, looking for the right sound while still being regarded as one of the elite guitarists of the decade. This documentary features that struggle and how Clapton dealt with it throughout the period.
The documentary aims to be a historical and educational reference rather than entertainment. The DVD is 120 minutes of old footage and has narration comparable to a video that might be shown in a classroom setting, not a concert film.
Despite this, Eric Clapton: The 1960’s Review is a detailed glimpse into the early stages of a legendary artist. It is an extremely informational film for any die-hard fan interested in diving deeper into the life of Clapton and some of the most formative years of his life.

After a BP oil drilling rig caused one of the worst environmental disasters in history, President Barack Obama’s administration declared a moratorium on any offshore drilling in the affected Gulf of Mexico area to help the devastated ecosystem recover.
But just six months later, the administration has decided to lift the moratorium and allow companies to reapply for offshore drilling permits.
Lifting the moratorium, however, doesn’t seem to benefit anyone.
William Brown | Daily Trojan
The environmentalists are outraged, saying the area hasn’t healed yet.
It hasn’t.
The businessmen and oil magnates are outraged, saying they won’t be able to obtain a permit for several weeks because of new, harsher standards.
They won’t.
No one seems satisfied.  
Someone is always bound to complain or find a flaw with all things related to public policy, but in this case neither side benefits. The Obama administration is just angering the involved parties.
Many view lifting the moratorium as a strictly political move in a crucial election year as Democrats scramble to secure seats in many states.
Obama himself will be traveling across the country to convince people to vote for Democrats — for evidence of this, we need to look no further than McCarthy Quad on Friday, where Obama will speak at a rally to support incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who will host a fundraiser in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
By reopening the Gulf to offshore oil drilling, the Obama administration seemingly forms an alliance with big business and oil companies that caused the oil spill.
Lifting the moratorium is a creation of contrived politics. It shows a failed attempt at bipartisanship, where politicians attempt to please everyone and end up pleasing no one.
Politicians should know that just one policy change will not win over voters in a heated election year. Of course, there will always be the few exceptions among businesses or individuals that will be happy with the early lift, but the majority will simply be frustrated.
The effects of the spill were felt from the ocean floor to the economy — thousands of jobs in the Gulf disappeared. But this policy isn’t the solution to those issues; it is the Democratic Party grasping for straws to save seats in Congress.
The Democrats even appear to be failing in their efforts to please big businesses; various websites have expressed concern that although the moratorium has technically been lifted, a “de facto” moratorium has replaced it.
This means that those in charge of approving permits to allow offshore drilling will take several weeks to complete the process, which means that it’s possible people will be kept out of work until the moratorium was supposed to be lifted anyway.
This is intended to encourage undecided voters who prioritize job creation and economic development to vote democratic. But how much value have the Democrats really placed on job creation by changing a policy that was bound to expire in about a month anyway?
Lastly, we can’t ignore the fact that lifting the moratorium doesn’t help the environment recover any more than the economy. More than 400 different species in the Gulf are in serious danger; the water is heavily contaminated with carcinogens and the full extent of the damage to the ocean floor is still unknown.
Yes, the local economy is slumping because of the temporary loss of jobs. But lifting the drilling moratorium isn’t any more appropriate a solution to that struggling economy than it is to the struggling environment.

Sir ,Madam
I am as any individual I don’t think that BP or any company has ability to drill oil well down in such deep, because of not having equipment and tools to do so, until they do get such method and tool they have not to ply with fire, and do disaster to our nice world and human rinse. All what BP done in Mexico gulf oil well explosion most mistakes, even at start they astonished and they don’t know what to do and they haven’t any thought to understand my comment. They asked me and trained me to write what they called a white paper, hey said they had another comment like this ,they where mixing, and now I found they start to understand my comment and they say proudly they do apply that comment on oil well at North sea east UK. Happy New Year to such western oil company they apply such idea without asking the producer.

Everything I need to know about self defense I learned from a dog-eared copy of The Outsiders.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
The last time I read that rumble-filled chronicle of teenage angst was in grade school, but I still remember a passage in which one of the many poorly named characters fends off an oncoming gang with a broken soda bottle.
When I moved to the west side of campus my junior year, that passage inspired me to walk around with an empty Perrier bottle in my pocket for a few months — I had received dire warnings from multiple people that the west side of campus was dicey.
I stopped carrying the bottle around when I realized my life wasn’t West Side Story, and that — like in most areas surrounding USC — if you don’t venture out by yourself at 3 a.m., you should be fine.
But you don’t need to encounter roving members of the Jets to realize that the area west of Vermont Avenue doesn’t enjoy as heavy of a university security presence as the rest of campus. For that, the community suffers.
The Department of Public Safety has done a commendable job of reducing crime on and off campus in the last few years.
The department’s annual security report released in September showed a sizable drop in reported incidents between 2007 and 2009. On-campus robberies, for example, plummeted from 20 reported incidents in 2007 to only one last year. The number of off-campus burglaries also dropped.
Another feather in DPS’ cap has been the deployment of Contemporary Services Corporation officers in North University Park last year; the yellow jackets act as a crime deterrent and their presence calms students late at night.
Though DPS has taken great strides to make North University Park a safer area, it now needs to turn its attention west of Vermont.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle explained that most students live north of campus, so DPS places the majority of its resources there.
“USC doesn’t own student housing west of Vermont,” he said. “We wanted to best utilize our resources where the students are most likely to be. We analyzed that area based on student foot traffic patterns, student housing and also where crimes have occurred.”
Carlisle also noted that recently more students have been moving west of campus in search of affordable housing, or, in my case, proximity to a Taco Bell.
Because of this, DPS patrols all areas surrounding campus. At this juncture, however, CSC personnel remain stolidly to the north.
It’s time for DPS to re-evaluate its use of yellow jackets. USC is still transitioning from a commuter to a residential school; thus, students will continue to require housing. This will only push higher numbers to the west side.
Though the majority of students do live elsewhere, there is still a substantial student population in this area.
In fact, those same yellow jackets would be an asset to non-USC affiliated residents as well; the entire community could reap the benefits of additional security.
The area around USC has made vast improvements. But it’s time for DPS to take the next step and acknowledge the Westside residents.

Yo, When I lived in the hood outside USC, I never got robbed because I was strategic with my Shizzle. Here are some tips that helped me:
1) If you are walking far into native territory, wear low key or baggy clothes. Many gangsters wear such clothes because it is easy to conceal a weapon, and thus they will be more cautious if you are wearing the same (see the teach the dougie rap video). If tight jeans or skimpy dresses are worn, thugs are less worried because they can easily see that you pose no threat, and that you may be in estrous.
2) Avoid wearing gangster apparel or walking with a gangster attitude. Wearing too much blue or red will prompt challenges from gang members, as will a gangster-like arrogance that will prompt local thugs to test that attitude. A track member may have been shot for this reason a few years ago. 
3) Trust your instincts and manipulate the instincts of others. If you think people are sizing you up, they probably are. Years of evolution have sharpened your perception, so you should trust it unless you are reallllly high. But like you, the local thugs also have instincts, and they can be fun to play with. One way of doing this would be to act in a way that an undercover policeman might, which would cause the thugs to abandon their criminal maneuvers. How do you do this? You could wear an ear piece or head phone in one ear, and pretend to talk into your wrist or a hidden microphone in you collar. If you are good at imitation or kinetic aping, walk with that stern and steady body language that most cops have while on duty. You can also flash discreet signs to others that appear to be some cop code. This could be touching your nose twice in a pronounced movement or coughing 3 times in an odd manner. Note: Never say that you are a cop. That is illegal and could get you into more trouble then getting fondled by young hoods. The goal here is to make a half-wit thug think they outwitted the cops and abandon their criminal venture before it started. I have done this many times, and funny has it is to picture someone doing these things, it always works for me, though if you look really un cop like (say, if you had Justin Bieber hair) and have no theatrical talent then you probably should avoid this tip.
4) Carry a fake wallet.  Get a cheapo wallet from the 99 Cents store and load it up with those fake credit card offers you get in the mail, and various other crap to make it look used. Make sure no information that can be traced back to you is in there. Sprinkle in some random business cards and 3 bucks, and you have something to toss if you get robbed. When the thugs go after the wallet you should start yelling and running away or prepare to engage if you are cornered and have the means to defend yourself and legally validate your actions in court.
Well, I hope these tactics help, but it is always best to avoid confrontation and call for help so that DPS can do their duty when things get crazy.
as somebody who lived over there it would have been nice to see yellow jackets and DPS more often.  even in daylight i was approached by a suspicious person. it was scary. i have lived west and north of campus and it was like day and night. granted both areas are not “safe”, you still feel a lot more comfortable north of campus. 
rule of thumb: when the sun goes down get your car!
Listen, regardless of whether you reside to the north of campus (everything south of the 10 FWY and maybe a couple streets north of Adams), you got to realize you’re in the nine-triple-zero-seven. You gotta be on your toes. This ain’t nine-oh-two-one-oh. SC’s in the ‘hood, and there ain’t denying that. Gentrification = BS. It’s an urban area, and it ain’t south Orange County or the real Westside, like the one our “beloved” neighbors are located at. 
Don’t trip, be cool, don’t floss your expensive gear i.e. iPods, iPhones, etc. while walking alone at night, or by your lonesome…because DPS can only do so much.
I think you’ve got the bottom line down.  In my three years here I’ve yet to run into trouble, mainly because I never asked for it.  I know people, however, who have not been so lucky, and while none of those people have any real horror stories to speak of, they’ve been intimidated before.  The question is, “Did they deserve it?”
Well, you tell me if using an iPad while obnoxiously laughing at a public bus stop is “low key”.
I don’t think that DPS should put CSC staff over there, at least not yet.  The area north of campus is a lot more densly populated with more apartment buildings and students than west of campus.
I think the first steps for west of campus would be to:
1. Increase the amount of street lighting.  I believe USC puts money forward to improve the street lighting north of campus and it has been built up for some time.  The lighting is much more closely spaced than on other streets, because of this it safer to put CSC security in the area.
2. Increase use of video surveillance.  DPS has been adding security cameras to street light poles and USC housing in the north portions.  While they still are doing this they should add cameras to the west side also.  There have been a number of crimes committed on Vermont (it seems everytime we get a trojan alert e-mail or text its on Vermont).
3. Begin using DPS officers on the chariots and bike officers in that area on random patrols.
I think they’re should be an improvement, but that it needs to be done in small steps just like it has been done on the north side for some time now.
