I remember I was in fifth grade when I decided to stop saying the Pledge of Allegiance. Maybe the words lost their meaning after I’d been rotely reciting them every morning for nearly six years. Maybe it was due in part to the hyper-visibility I felt every time someone asked where I was from, despite the fact that I’d been born and bred in the States. Maybe it felt too disingenuous to avow my dedication to a country that doesn’t completely feel like home.
Although my passport has always bore an American seal, my nationality has always felt up to contest and questioning. There were the neighbors in my cul-de-sac who didn’t want to play with “the stupid Chinese kids” and the teachers who assumed I wasn’t fluent in English. There were the cashiers and waiters who talked down to my parents because of their accents and the constant pressing questions about my heritage. Somehow, these inquirers never seemed satisfied with me merely saying I was American or offering up my hometown; they would persist until I begrudgingly admitted that my parents were from China. I was always careful with my words but it always felt like I had to tread the delicate line between the answer that was expected and the objective truth about my citizenship. 
For the record, after nearly 20 years of growing up here and speaking only this language, yes, I am an American citizen. Aside from cheering on our athletes in PyeongChang, South Korea and loving the cities I call home, I still feel largely alienated from this country that is supposed to represent me. I feel uncomfortable in crowds chanting “USA!” like mindless automatons. When I see people’s hands on their hearts, beaming with pride, I can only think of the ways this country has told me I was different and unwanted, and how I don’t feel enough of a connection to the flag to venerate it. Much of the intended symbolism behind the stars and stripes of our flag — whether it is nationalist pride or the American Dream itself — I take with a grain of salt. 
It is art that has taught me I am not alone in this experience. In art, the American flag is more than just a symbol of patriotism — more often than not, it is a symbol of dissidence and a blatant subversion of hegemonic values. Art history and politics have been inextricably intertwined in the remediation of flag iconography, often with a heretical twist. In both art and politics, the flag is a rare and sophisticated motif, rife with symbolism. The fascinating dichotomy central to many of our contemporary debates surrounding the flag — including President Donald Trump’s 2016 declaration that anyone who burns a flag should be stripped of their citizenship and his condemnation of  NFL free agent Colin Kapernick’s refusal to stand during the national anthem — have been evident in art for countless decades.

Most famously, out of the crux of Cold War America came Jasper Johns’ Flag — a seemingly mundane rendition of an everyday object created with painted shreds of newspaper pulp dipped in encaustic. It is meek and unassuming on the surface but carries a whole host of connotations specific to the artist’s experience. And for Johns, a gay man living under a McCarthyist regime, that meant a closeted critique on the lie manifest in the American flag: Imperialism disguised as nationalism, oppression masquerading as freedom under a deceitful banner of red, white and blue. Johns endured backlash from patriots who deemed his work disrespectful due to its unorthodox and messy medium but, amazingly, deflected controversy by claiming he meant nothing by it. 
Similarly, African American artist Dred Scott created a flash point for conservative scorn when he displayed an American flag on the floor of an exhibit as a doormat on which patrons walk on. It was a move that President George H. W. Bush called “disgraceful” and culminated in Scott and three other protesters burning the flag on the steps of the Capitol that same year. Scott’s provocative statement led to a landmark ruling in freedom of expression that protected the right of anyone to reinterpret the flag as they chose — but most importantly, it exposed a highly sensitive spot in the American psyche that our current socio-political landscape seems determined to tap into again. 
Johns and Scott, among others who saw their differences metastasized and ostracized here at home, saw right through the star-spangled facade of everything the flag represented — or rather, everyone it excluded from representation. Throughout art history, the genre of American flag art has refused to celebrate patriotism but has used the symbolism of the flag to say quite the opposite. In Johns’ case, as an artist known for his mass flag reproductions, he ridicules the ironic absence of emotion in perpetuating an image to the point that it is meaningless. 
I feel the same way. When we talk about the flag, we cling to its metaphor and create constant discourse surrounding how flags, as symbols, should be treated and revered. But to many, the nationalist attachments of the flag motif are a double-edged sword and to these artists, they are a goldmine for renegade art. In art, activism takes precedence over blind love of country. 
I pledge allegiance to the flag and to the wholly inclusive America that doesn’t yet exist, but that of which Johns and Scott wanted so desperately to be a part.

Mathematics professor Neelesh Tiruviluamala is the highest-rated professor at USC, according to the user-generated ranking platform RateMyProfessors.com. His profile reveals tags that recognize him for his “amazing lectures,” his “caring” and “hilarious” nature and his ability to provide students with “good feedback.”
RateMyProfessors.com is a user-generated ranking and review platform, similar to Yelp and TripAdvisor. Mahira Raihan | Daily Trojan
Large block letters at the top of Tiruviluamala’s page show that 100 percent of his students who were surveyed would take a class with him again, and according to the site’s metrics, Tiruviluamala has garnered a perfect score from the 56 reviews he has received.
Because students are able to read and write reviews of virtually any educator across the nation, Rate My Professors has amassed more than 19 million reviews of various teaching professionals since. Founded in 1999, the site says its mission is to do “what students have been doing forever — checking in with each other … to figure out who’s a great professor and who’s one you might want to avoid.”
At USC, students are encouraged to complete end-of-semester online course evaluations, which provide officials insight into faculty’s teaching effectiveness and are associated with promotions and tenure decisions, according to Vice Provost for Academic and Faculty Affairs Elizabeth Graddy. However, students are not able to access their peers’ evaluations or generally view a professor’s rating.
Students like Kayla Brown, a freshman studying health promotions, turn to Rate My Professors as a resource in determining professors who would offer her a valuable learning experience, and she hopes USC would consider publicizing students’ course evaluations.
“Some [students] have good experiences and some have bad experiences [with a professor], but if we’re all reporting those experiences, the sample data is just a larger pool,” Brown said. “Versus Rate My Professors, you’ll find two, three, maybe four to five posts. So if we have a bigger view [on the course], I think that will be immensely helpful.”
Although Brown acknowledges Rate My Professors’ shortcomings to provide a holistic perspective of a professor’s class, she considers it a preparatory overview before she decides to register.
“It’s actually influenced my class choices,” she said. “I definitely prefer [knowing how professors are], because then I know what I have to do to do better [in the course]. So if I know that one professor is a really hard teacher, then I know from the beginning to stay on top of the readings.”
BIAS
With the ubiquity of these public review forums — such as Yelp, TripAdvisor and Rate My Professor — a culture of shared opinions and reviews has developed online.
Yet, these sites can be influenced by a voluntary response bias, in which users with extremely positive or negative experiences dominate the review process, according to a New Yorker article on workplace reviews. Similarly, students unfamiliar with a platform like Rate My Professors, or indifferent to its effects, might be entirely absent in the survey results.
The higher merit of USC-admin-istered course evaluations still does not eliminate bias in students, Graddy said, and they are not released publicly due to the University’s privacy concerns.
“What we do know is that there tends to be, in most of these evaluations, a bias against women and faculty of color, and so that’s problematic in our office,” Graddy said. “We’re trying to figure out how we can improve our instrument. I think the question is how do we try to keep improving the instrument itself to make it more specific. So, the more specific it is, the less likely, I think, those biases are to come in.”
The questions on USC’s evaluation form aim to measure similar metrics on Rate My Professors’, such as clarity and approachability outside of class, yet are more specific and address the strengths and weaknesses of the professor.
Though the evaluations are supposed to be mandatory, response rates have fallen dramatically since they switched from paper surveys to electronic forms, Graddy said.
“One of the things we’ve observed now is more incivility in the responses since they’re online,” she said. “There are some things that would disturb you in these course evaluations … and I wonder if students would write them if they knew they’d be made public.”
ACCURACY
Rate My Professors’ accuracy garners mixed reviews among academics. Like Brown, Tiruviluamala noted the site’s reviews are highly subjective and leave out important information about a teacher’s overall teaching style from an academic perspective. He compared the site’s popularity to social media comments; a new phenomenon to the digital generation.
“[Teaching] is not like a movie; it’s a 15-week linear algebra course,” he said. “It’s different from what [an academic] would look at. Does this person push students that’s good for them long term in ways they don’t even know?” 
A professor’s teaching style — how “hard” or “easy” they are — can affect a student’s academic career in the long run when they’re learning harder concepts, according to Tiruviluamala.
In addition, gendered language in teacher reviews can also skew results seen on the site, according to a 2015 data compilation by Northeastern University professor Benjamin Schmidt. In his analysis of around 14 million Rate My Professors reviews, Schmidt said male teachers were more likely to receive positive words than their female counterparts, and female teachers received more reviews with fashion-related words.
Despite potential implicit biases and the platform’s crowdsourced format, some students feel the anonymous platform provides a space for honesty. Elizabeth McAtee, a freshman studying classics and philosophy, politics and law, believed the site is a good indicator of a professor’s teaching style and class demeanor. 
“I think not necessarily every single detail about Rate My Professors is 100 percent accurate, but the overall impression that it gives of a certain person can be useful in determining what a professor is like or what class you should take,” McAtee said.

On a Wednesday morning, Cameron Casillas sits in the quaint, yellow kitchen of the El Centro Chicano office in the Student Union Building. His face is lit up from the glow of his laptop screen and a microwave whirs behind him as he types.
El Centro Chicano offers tutoring, networking opportunities, student advocacy, personal support and other resources for members of the Latinx and Chicanx communities at USC. Photo from USC website.
“Honestly, I first started coming because there’s a microwave,” said Casillas, a senior majoring in human biology. “Sometimes it’s kind of hard to take food from home because I commute.”
When Casillas transferred to USC two years ago, El Centro Chicano was one of the first communities that made him feel at home, he said.
“I’m kind of a quiet person, normally,” Casillas said. “But here, I found several people who were very, very easy to approach me, to make me feel welcome, especially as a transfer student. So that helped me a lot to fit in and get integrated here.”
El Centro Chicano at USC was founded in 1972 during a time when the Chicano population was rapidly growing in South Los Angeles, as well as in the pool of USC applicants. Today, El Centro Chicano offers student advocacy, tutoring, networking opportunities, personal support and assistance for Latinx student groups all with the primary goal of empowering the Chicanx and Latinx community on and off-campus.
“We are a place that orients our students and makes them aware of so many amazing resources at USC from offices, departments, programs, club/organizations, faculty, staff, fellow undergrad and graduate peers,” Billy Vela, the director of El Centro, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “El Centro Chicano is also a place that welcomes from our very diverse community and we love seeing students who are not Chicanx or Latinx who have found a home here too.”
Victoria Perez, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, said she first learned about El Centro when she was a freshman living on the Latino floor of her residence hall. Earlier that year, she’d attended an open house held by Vela. This year, as a sophomore at the University, she feels that the El Centro office has quickly grown into a home base for her on campus to get work done.
“[Vela] was really, really understanding in letting us know it’s a safe space and a lot of people are coming from specific neighborhoods and specific backgrounds where we’re just more comfortable around our own people,” Perez said. 
In an effort to broaden the inclusivity of the program, the Central American Network released a petition on Feb. 12 requesting for the removal of “Chicano” from its name. According to the program’s petition, this request for a name change is not meant to “attack or diminish the Chicano culture or movement,” but rather to continue to uphold the program’s principles of “inclusion, pride and democracy.”
“The current Latinx community on campus consists of people with varied cultural identities, who practice various religions or none at all, who represent all facets of the LGBTQIA+ community, and who may or may not identify as ‘Chicano,’” the petition states.
In response to the petition, Edgar Sanchez, a freshman majoring in computational neuroscience, said that like Perez, he believes that the current program title with the word “Chicano” is a large part of what makes the program special. 
“Personally I think that’s what gives this place its identity, so it would be a shame to have that taken off,” Sanchez said. “But I definitely think that no matter what the name is, the people that belong here are the one that make this place.”

Receiving psychotherapy treatment can be challenging for those who don’t have the time or means to go to a physical clinic. The Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work’s Telehealth program recognizes this need and tries to subvert the issue — the online clinic uses a “face-to-face” method of video conferencing between patients and psychotherapy services to provide evidence-based clinical interventions.

Founded six years ago by Dworak-Peck Dean Marilyn Flynn, Telehealth has a multitude of online counselors that partner with each client to develop a care plan, including research-based interventions to help them meet their individual and family goals. These interventions align with Dworak-Peck’s emphasis on practice that yields tangible results, while crossing barriers to entry with healthcare. 
“There was a resistance or reluctance in some ways to bring that service or to bring the treatment directly in to people’s homes,” said Nadia Islam, Telehealth clinical director. “There were concerns around safety, privacy and so on, and that’s really what we took on as our challenge, because if we couldn’t reach people in their homes, there was still that barrier of needing to get to [them].”
Telehealth’s main purpose is to allow clients to get help from the comfort of their own home, specifically for those who may not be able to afford traditional counseling, or patients whose lifestyle or job requires them to move often.
“It offers an option for individuals and families who are not able or willing to present in person in a therapist’s office,” Islam said. “There are tons of people who have mental health needs and they could benefit from treatment but they don’t know how to connect those dots because of employment barriers, transportation barriers, mobility issues … Telehealth gives them the option to access behavioral health care in their own homes, provided they have access to technology and a private space.”
The program relies on a video conferencing platform designed to follow federal security guidelines. During a regular meeting, the client and counselor connect from different locations via a computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone. 
Clients also have the option of meeting therapists in person for the first few sessions to get to know them first and become more comfortable. 
“Once people have met individually in person it makes it so much easier,” said Marleen Wong, executive director of the Telehealth Clinic. “The relationship is started and then they are familiar with how to communicate on the internet.”
Telehealth currently has 30 licensed clinical social workers and Master of Social Work interns in California, which are organized into different treatment teams led by a clinical supervisor or faculty member. 
Wong hopes the program can continue to grow, including its goal to provide service to college student populations. 
“We’re looking at contracts that could serve other populations for free,” Wong said. “If there were a contact for university services … where there undergraduates wanted to be served, or the whole student body for that matter, they could simply just contact us … and we could connect them right away and get those services started.”

USG announced that Senators Debbie Lee and Blake Ackerman won the USG presidential election by a margin of approximately 100 votes in Tuesday’s senate meeting. Lee will serve as USG president and Ackerman as vice president for the 2018-19 academic year. 
Graphic by Emily Smith and Terry Nguyen | Daily Trojan
The Debbie & Blake ticket received 49.19 percent of the votes cast last week, while the Mai & Brianna ticket received 46.7 percent. The rest of the votes, totaling 190, were abstentions. There were 4,627 votes cast this year.
The senate election results were also shared during the meeting. The incoming USG Senators are Will Sherman, Gabriel Savage, Shayan Kohanteb, Max Geschwind, Meagan Lane, Amy Chong, Manda Bwerevu, Matthew Crane, Jillian Halperin, Michaela Murphy, Jacquelyne Tan and Diviya Gupta.
The results are unofficial, though, until all financial paperwork for the candidates is submitted and reviewed. Furthermore, the director of campus activities must finalize the results once the review is complete.
Lee, when asked how current President and Vice President Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan can aid her and Blake in their transition, noted the initiatives the current administration will bequeath to them.
“I think Austin and Morgan have completed a lot of initiatives, but I also know that they have a whole board of initiatives on the way,” Lee said. “So I think not only will the transition be us learning how to take on the position but also a transition of projects that they’ve worked on.”
Ackerman emphasized that he and Lee want to work with and hear from all students, including those who voted against them.
“I think, most importantly, Debbie and I said during this election that we want to listen first,”  he said. “We want to hear from students, and students don’t have to agree with us. We want to listen to everyone. We want to hear their voices.”
Lee hopes to foster more diversity within USG so that it can be more representative of the student body.
“I think that Austin and Morgan have done a great job in a lot of areas,” she said. “But, I think something new that we can bring to the table is cultivating an organization that actually holds itself accountable to diversity.”

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Time management can be a battle when you’re committed to a hectic course load, a part-time job and several extracurricular activities. But it can be done. The key is to develop effective habits, while simultaneously giving yourself room for flexibility. By doing so, you can accomplish your goals without compromising your intended level of success — or even your sanity.
Try implementing these five strategies to reap the benefits of operating at maximum efficiency.
Know your daily rhythm.
You know your mind and body best. You know which times you’re most energetic, and which times you’re most lethargic. For instance, knowing that my self-motivation level is at its peak in the morning means I’m able to schedule studying for the beginning of the day in order to increase efficiency and productivity. However, I lose much of that motivation after lunch, which is why I’ve scheduled most of my classes and work shifts in the afternoon. Having more structure in the afternoons makes me more productive. Scheduling your time based on your daily rhythm helps your work flow and saves energy.
Set timers.
What would normally take me an hour without a timer, can take 30 minutes with one. When provided with a time crunch, I’m less susceptible to distractions and feel more obligated to complete the task within the allotted time. Also, for many, the hardest part of getting anything done is actually getting started. When I sit down, I set a short timer for about 20-40 minutes and decide to start working. Once the timer goes off, I don’t have to stop  if I’m not done with my task, I can keep going. But once you set the timer and get into the groove of something, you’ll be more inclined to keep working until you’re finished.
Schedule guilt-free breaks.
These are real breaks, not procrastination breaks. An example of a procrastination break is watching a show while mentally draining yourself through guilt. If you take breaks, incorporate them into your schedule. Based on your preferences, you could schedule several short ones or a couple of long ones. Either way, you’d be more intentional about your time, preventing procrastination, and keeping you from feeling guilty.
Identify time-wasters — and make time for them.
Whether it’s a phone call or checking your email, some trivial tasks can be a means of procrastination. Although you might perceive them as productive work, they tend to be short distractions that add up quickly over the course of a day. By recognizing which of your tasks are time-wasters, you can set aside some “blank space” in your schedule for them. Save the mundane and the mindless for lower-energy times. This way, you’re still able to get it all done, and at no cost to the bigger priorities.
Prioritize by importance.
If you have a long to-do list, there is a good chance that some of the items can wait. By prioritizing your most important work and doing them first, you can be more flexible if new tasks come up.
Most crucially, it is important to remember that while balance is key, so is flexibility. Neither of these is a one-size-fits-all. To account for your personal preferences is to avoid being a slave to time. You know yourself best to set the most realistic expectations. Thus, rather than trying to change how you operate, use this knowledge to your full advantage and plan accordingly. Only when you work within your capacity will you feel in control of all the time at your disposal, and also yield the best results.

For most people, traveling with friends is one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences. Especially with a 3-day weekend and spring break in the near future, it’s on everyone’s minds. You’ll get to spend days or weeks with your favorite people and run on a schedule that your group will usually agree on. However,  trips with friends have their fallbacks as well. Maybe someone backs out at the last minute, or you can’t all agree on plans or an appropriate budget, leaving you with packed bags and unfulfilled wanderlust. For times like these, allow me to introduce solo traveling.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Often daunting and unappealing on the surface, solo traveling isn’t something most people are dying to do, especially for young adults. But it can be rewarding in myriad ways that differ from traveling with friends. Your day is dictated entirely by your own schedule, your own pace and your own preferences. You don’t need to compromise your meal choices because your friends want something else. And most of all, you can meet people that you wouldn’t have otherwise met and have conversations you wouldn’t otherwise have started. But, of course, it’s natural to be a bit afraid: What if you get lonely? What if something happens to you? What if you get lost? Fear not, here are some tips to help you get started and ease your worries:
1) Book your lodging early, and book it at hostels. It’s natural that solo traveling can lead to loneliness, but if you’re staying in a hostel, you can take solace in the fact that there will be many other solo travelers. So seize the opportunity and strike up conversation. This is a perfect opportunity to create a small network while abroad. Since almost everyone shares a common love for food, ask them to grab a bite or to go out for a drink, maybe even venture together to that cool touristy spot you’ve been eyeing. You’ll be surprised with how interesting and friendly people can be around the world, and hostels provide you with a place to meet other travelers like yourself. As far as choosing a place to stay, I prefer booking through Hostelworld.com. It shows the best rankings and the most convenient locations. Pro-tip: avoid Booking.com. They’re known to inflate their prices and show unrealistic pictures. 
2)    Pack lightly. It may be difficult to downsize to a smaller piece of luggage, but trust me, you will thank me later. The last thing you want is to have way more than you can carry, which will make getting to your destination inordinately more difficult, especially if you’re traveling to multiple cities during your trip. Your three-day weekend or upcoming spring break trip is not the time to bring that shirt you bought a year ago that you’ve never worn, just because you might wear it but you know you probably won’t. Bring a pair of comfortable shoes and a pair of nice ones. Overall, be realistic.
3) Start your day early. Even in smaller cities, there are a ton of things to do and an infinite number of people to meet. Wake up early, eat breakfast and make a (loose) plan for the day. Make sure you have your bag packed, your phone charged and anything else you need. You’ll feel like you’re wasting your day if you sleep in until noon.
4) Embrace the fact that you’re alone. Let yourself spend hours in a park taking pictures if you want to. Sometimes it’s not all about how much ground you covered, but about the little moments you’ll remember and talk about well after the trip is over. Stroll leisurely, take your time and strike up a conversation with a local, or someone who looks like they may be traveling alone, too.
5) Don’t forget your portable charger. This one is pretty self-explanatory. You don’t want to be somewhere at night, desperately needing your phone, just to find out that it’s dead.
Now that you’re a little more comfortable with the thought of traveling alone, the only question left is, where do you want to go? With Spring break right around the corner and multiple long weekends, the options are truly endless! 
For longer breaks,  I recommend major European cities such as, Madrid, Berlin, and Amsterdam. With the help of trains, traveling between cities becomes quick and easy. For shorter 3-day vacations, California itself has a ton of cool spots– Big Sur, Sonoma Valley, Santa Barbara, and major cities like San Francisco, as well as a ton of natural parks. So, save up a bit of money, do a little too much planning and get traveling!

I transfered to USC for my sophomore year and although I live only 30 minutes away from campus, this school felt like an alien planet. My first semester I knew no one, had no idea how to get around, and made the grave mistake of cutting myself off.
I think we tend to emotionally disconnect from insecure situations, like starting at a new school. I spent my first semester reading a book during lunch and driving home after my classes. I was socially isolating myself as a defense mechanism. I felt like a transfer student.
However, all it took was one person to make me feel like I actually belonged. 
I was, what she called, “aggressively friended” by someone who I’m still best friends with today. She came up to me after French class and said, “Hey, let’s go to the Grove together.” I almost said no because I was so nervous. Within days of having this new friend, the campus opened itself up to me. She showed me her favorite spots to hang out, eat, study, and get coffee. Places that make a campus feel a little more like home.
From then on, I started to love doing my homework at the Coffee Bean at the cinema school and studying by the Fertitta fireplace. I discovered a hidden gem at Good Karma: a buffet filled with entirely vegan options that only costs $10. During the days when I am too tired to function, my go to nap area is the couches in the student union. These are just a few of my favorite spots here at SC. 
I was lucky to be a local transfer student, but for those of you from out of state, make LA feel more like home by finding new places to hang out that make the city seem smaller. Some of my personal favorites are Verve and Bluebottle in downtown, as well as Wurstkuche and Zinc in the arts district. My favorite places to eat on campus are Good Karma, Seeds, and the Fertitta sushi and ramen bar. Now that we have the beautiful new Village, try my favorites like Cava, Dulce, and Sunlife Organics. If you’re feeling fancy and want to get off campus for a bit, a well-kept secret is the sushi restaurant called Sora in the new Intercontinental Hotel. If you ask for the booths in the back you’ll be seated right up against a window, 69 floors up with a view that cannot be beat! 
If you’re looking for fun things to do around LA, visit Olvera Street (the oldest street in the city), get a table at the Hollywood Improv Comedy Club, or walk around the Venice canals during sunset – you can even rent a little boat. 
Although finding my favorite spots on campus helped make me feel more at home, getting an on campus job helped me find my family. I work at the Dornsife Office of Advisement and Student Services and it was the last place I expected to find my closest friends, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. I found fulfillment and happiness through getting involved; two things every student looks for in college. If you’re interested in coming to work with our great team, come visit our office at GFS 315. We’ll be hiring new interns in the fall. 
Aside from getting an on campus job, there is a multitude of ways to get involved, including clubs. Once admitted, students have the choice of choosing from over 800 student organizations, nearly guaranteeing success when looking for something that interests you. Two clubs I would personally recommend are the Trojan Knights or Helenes, two of USC’s spirit and service clubs. In addition, Greek life is another great way to meet people and have fun. USC offers several fraternities and sororities to choose from. If you’re feeling more on the creative side, contemplate writing for the school newspaper and yours truly, the Daily Trojan. 
Lastly, USC Transfer Student Community is a new club on campus. Created by transfers, the club is designed to connect newly admitted students to the Trojan Family. They meet every Monday in Leavey Library, room B16 to show transfer students all of the ways that they can get involved on campus. Go check out their Facebook page to learn more. 
Most importantly, know that no matter how hard it may be right now, USC will feel like home and soon enough you’ll have a family to enjoy it with. 
Who knows, maybe I’ll aggressive friend you.

Swipe left if it’s a no go. Swipe right if you’re down. From Tinder to Bumble, dating apps are a pretty prevalent force on college campuses, but are they ruining the magic of the organic way of meeting someone? Some people may argue that dating apps take out the romance of a “meet cute” aka the scenario in which the movies show a couple meeting in a zany, destined-to-fall-in-love-star-crossed-lovers way. 
Dating apps also rely heavily on judging someone solely by their appearance and maybe a couple clever sentences in a bio they write. These characteristics may seem superficial, but I argue that we do these EXACT same things in real life. We all know that first impressions are everything. In my everyday life, I am interested in a guy if I find them visually attractive. Blue eyes, dark hair, 6 feet tall boys are my weakness (what can I say, I’m human). Once I see that, I’m done. Those first couple of things he says to me is his time to shine and that’s when I judge if I’m interested (or if I’m swiping left in real life).
 Dating apps are also a great outlet when you need a little confidence booster. It’s nice to know when you’re feeling a little too single on a Friday night that someone out there thinks you’re hot. You also have the chance to say the most outrageous things to guys and laugh at their responses while hanging with your girls.
As a single girl on USC’s campus, I’ve developed a technique on dating apps that has proved highly effective. Let me break it down for you. The key to Tinder and Bumble is to use the settings to your advantage. Put the distance to only 5 miles away then swipe through and you will find yourself basically on an app for the single people at USC. On Bumble, hit up these boys or girls with the “I’ve always had a thing for guys/girls with (insert a characteristic they have here).” My go to is complimenting their eye color or the sport they play. Easy, simple, and ends up with a response every time. 
More often than not, the guys I swipe right on end up knowing one of my friends and if not, I now know that this cute guy that goes to USC is single. Then, the next time I see him at a party, I have a flirty conversation starter and I know he’s on the market. Not only that, I know he’s swiped right on me and thinks I’m cute. The hard part is over my friends. 
My advice to USC students is to not overthink these dating apps and don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.  They broaden the market for available guys or girls and if you end up meeting your future spouse then you can thank me for the encouragement. Happy swiping friends!

Q: How does a college student deal with depression? Please don’t say contact the Counseling Center.
Hecuba is ready to answer any and all of your questions
There are so many reasons freshman year is a difficult time for everyone, and the most important thing to realize is that it’s not easy for anyone. But just by recognizing that you’re hurting, that your struggle is valid, that you are taking steps to deal with what you’re going through and move forward shows just how strong you are.
Many freshmen — myself included, back in the day — start college fresh off of the happiest year of their life. Senior year of high school is all about bonding and basking in your years-in-the-making friendships for an epic, final chapter of memory-making. You start college with the mindset that you must immediately replicate not only those friendships that took years to build, but also the void of leaving behind close family members, and that unrealistic expectation is a set-up for disappointment. Social media and the notorious fear of missing out, better known as FOMO, all make it seem like your fellow freshmen are having so much more fun or are so much farther along in their friendships and relationships than you are, which only adds to the pain.
Of course, there are so many other sources for mental health struggles among college freshmen. You might be used to excelling in your classes and other pursuits, and if you’re not able to live up to your standards for yourself in your college classes or extracurricular activities, it’s natural to react negatively. And there may be many other personal, individual factors for everyone. Depression is much more common than you might believe. More than 36 percent of college students report suffering from it, which means the number is probably higher even than that. You’re definitely not alone, if that’s any comfort.
But of course, just because depression is common among freshmen, don’t think that doesn’t make you and your experiences unique. Everyone is different, and has different needs. That being said, here are some ideas you may want to consider trying.
Being honest and just talking about your problems, or saying the words “I have depression” aloud isn’t easy for anyone, and certainly not for those just getting acclimated to a new environment. Don’t expect conversations about mental health to be easy, but know that you’ll be stronger and healthier for engaging in them.
For starters, arrange a time to talk to your RA. RAs definitely understand and recall what it was like to be a freshman, and while they’re also full-time students and may not always be able to make time, they can have honest conversations with you about their own experiences, and are trained to talk about your options with you. Some students find mentors, role models and even lifelong friends in their RAs. If that’s too idealistic, at the very least, it’s important to have someone to check in on you and see how you’re feeling every now and then. Either way, just talking about your feelings, thoughts and experiences with someone who may have gone through it before you will relieve all kinds of stress, and could be enlightening for you — to explain your experiences in words and in a manner that invites understanding always is.
Before going further, take a step back and assess if your depression or other mental health ailments are affecting your academic performance. If they are and if a particular class is stressing you out, arrange a time to talk to your professor about what you’re going through. Believe it or not, most professors want nothing more than to see you succeed and will be supportive and accommodating. It’s important for them to know if and why you’re not able to do your best in their class, or if you might need some extra time, help and support. In addition to talking to your professor, also arrange to talk to your academic advisor about options that may be more fitting for your mental health. 
And now, as predictable and perhaps cliche as this last piece of advice maybe, it’s important that you try talking to your friends — whether they go to USC or not. It’s hard to open up, but you never know who might be able to relate to your experiences. Tell your friend that you don’t expect them to have the answers, but that listening to you, checking up on you now and then and just being mindful and aware of what you’re going through would make a big difference. Based on your background or where you’re from, there might be great stigma associated with mental health; again, don’t be hard on yourself for feeling nervous, guilty or even embarrassed in talking about what you’re experiencing. You can’t help how you feel, and you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. If a friend is meant to be in your life, they’ll be compassionate and respectful, and if not, you are better off without them. 
Lastly, as someone who has gone to Engemann seeking counseling services and experienced firsthand its limited resources, I understand why you sought advice about other options. But in addition to all of these ideas, if you are comfortable doing so, I still highly recommend completing an online form, doing the phone intake and seeing how you feel when counseling services finally become available some weeks later. In the intake alone, you are asked questions that help just by setting you up to try to explain your feelings and situation in words; this can be eye-opening for you.
If you’re not quite ready to talk to anyone just yet, don’t worry — we all move at our own paces and just being mindful and self-aware is a huge first step. Reflect on your life and what you enjoy or don’t enjoy each day by journaling. If that’s not an option due to your busy schedule, meditate in bed before sleeping. Try to engage in neutral activities that clear your mind, such as coloring books, drawing, taking walks or knitting. Think of an old childhood hobby, or anything you once or think you might be able to enjoy doing for fun, and to satisfy no one else but you; try and make time for this activity. Making time is easier said than done, but it could make all the difference, so at least give it a shot. And, of course, practice self-care: Each day take a step back to see how you’ve been eating, how much sleep you’re getting and so on and so forth. It’s hard to achieve good mental health without putting good physical health first.

Democratic strategist and esteemed campaign manager Joe Trippi discussed his insider perspective on Alabama Senator Doug Jones’s campaign, the internet’s role in politics, and the future political scene with USC’s Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Bob Shrum. The conversation, one of several in the Institute’s semester-long speaker series, was held at Tommy’s Place.
Photo by Mahira Raihan | Daily Trojan
The discussion began with insights into the Doug Jones campaign, where Trippi served as media strategist and senior advisor. When asked how Jones, a Democratic running in a deeply Republican state, managed to pull off an upset victory, Trippi responded that it was Jones’s message, not data analytics or allegations against his opponent, that won him the race.
“He hit a chord with republican women, with college educated republicans, younger republicans, who were getting tired of the chaos and the division and the hostility, and were willing to vote for a democrat for the first time in their lives because he so exuded that urge to work across party lines and find common ground,” Trippi said.
Trippi also dismissed the notion that the sexual misconduct allegations against Jones’s opposition played a significant role in the race. If anything, he noted, they made the race more partisan, something the campaign was trying to avoid. Their goal was to tap into the bipartisan hunger to come together as a country in the face of the hostility, not demonize one side.
After discussing the Jones campaign, Shrum shifted the conversation to the internet’s role in politics. Trippi, who essentially pioneered the internet campaign with his work on Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential run, expressed the internet’s great potential, while maintaining its harmful ability to isolate and the ease with which it can manipulate people. He used the Jones campaign to illustrate this last point.
“If you look at the hacking and the bots, I mean in the Jones campaign, we were tracking 10,000 bots that were posting 65,000 posts per hour, all doing fake yearbook, and things like that,” Trippi said. The ramifications, though not quantifiable, could in theory swing an election.
Despite this danger, Trippi praised the internet for being an immensely efficient low-dollar fundraising mechanism and for engaging more people in the democratic process.
According to Trippi, the internet, and more specifically social media, gave President Trump’s campaign its edge.
“Trump understood how much power social media can have to engage people who don’t normally participate in the process,” Trippi said, “using social media to directly communicate to 17 to 18 million people…in a process where only 25-30 million total were going to participate in the Republican primary,” let him reach out to voters directly, significantly boosting his campaign’s success.
On a broader note, Trippi gave his input on the current state of politics and his predictions for the future.
“The energy right now, Donald Trump is fueling two things: massive energy with democrats…and a growing unease with a significant enough segment of the Republican party and Independents,” Trippi said
From Trippi’s perspective, Trump has created anger in the Democratic base and exhaustion in his own party. This lead Trippi to predict Democrats not only winning the House of Representatives in the 2018 election, but taking the Senate too.
As the conversation came to a close, Trippi revealed his immense hope in the youngest generation.
“My optimism comes from your generation [addressing the audience, mainly students].” He pointed out that Millennials are now the largest generation, so their electoral power will soon pass other generations, and that young people have the capacity to pressure today’s leaders, as seen in Florida in the wake up the Parkland school shooting.
Max Ellis, a freshman majoring in political science, said Trippi’s hope in his generation had the biggest impact on him.
“I’ve always looked at it personally as who’s going to be the next big face, who’s going to be the next big figure or leader for our country…but him saying that it could be a whole generation was pretty informing,” Ellis said.
