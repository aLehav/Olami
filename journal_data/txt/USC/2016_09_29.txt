Josh Kun, a cultural historian and professor of communication at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, believes that, at their core, historically separated communities actually have a lot in common.
Photo courtesy of the MacArthur Foundation Let’s get creative · Josh Kun studies pop culture — with a focus on music — in Los Angeles, along the Mexican border and in the Jewish-American community. He teaches communication at Annenberg.
“When you look at any cultural object or artifact from history, what you are looking at is things that are real intersections and crossovers of experiences,” Kun said. “And I try really hard to work to respect all of the lives, stories and engagements that encounter the exchange with any particular moment of cultural history.”
Last week, Kun was selected as one of 23 recipients of the MacArthur Genius Grant, a gift of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Kun will be awarded $625,000 in equal quarterly installments over five years. The MacArthur fellowship is awarded to individuals who have shown exceptional creativity in their work and promise to continue to do so. The foundation’s Selection Committee invites external nominators to suggest candidates by writing a letter to the program staff, describing their reasons for the nomination.
“While our communities, our nation and our world face both historic and emerging challenges, these 23 extraordinary individuals give us ample reason for hope,” MacArthur Foundation President Julia Stasch said in a statement. “They are breaking new ground in areas of public concern, in the arts, and in the sciences, often in unexpected ways. Their creativity, dedication, and impact inspire us all.”
Kun will not receive the award money until next year, but said that he is going to use the time until then to help strategize and think clearly about the kinds of projects that he is going to launch in the next few years. Kun also has plans to be able to use a part of his winnings to fund scholarships or grants for young people working in the same field as he does.
“I am very honored that the foundation saw in my work some traces and reflections of that idea of exceptional creativity,” Kun said. “I try very hard to do work and expand it with new methods and new kinds of practices across disciplines and fields to help scholarship be as public as it can be.”
Throughout his life, Kun has worked as a journalist, researcher, essayist, curator and professor focusing on pop culture in Los Angeles along the U.S.-Mexico border and among the Jewish-American community. Kun earned his Ph.D. in ethnic Studies from UC Berkeley and served as an associate professor of English at the University of California, Riverside. At USC, he directs the Popular Music Project at Annenberg’s Norman Lear Center and founded the USC Annenberg Distinguished Lecture Series on Latin American Arts & Culture.
Kun also works as an editor for the International Journal of Communication, co-editor of the book series Refiguring American Music for Duke University Press and co-curator of Crossfade Lab, an Arizona-based conversation and performance series. He has authored numerous books and had his writing appear in publications including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, American Prospect, Los Angeles Magazine and LA Weekly.
At present, Kun is in the middle of a project with the Getty Foundation for their initiative called the “Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA,” which aims to explore the Latin American music in discourse with Los Angeles. Kun is currently editing an anthology of writing about the history of American music in Los Angeles, as well as curating a series of public musical events to take place next fall.

USC women’s soccer continued its hot streak on Thursday, as the No. 9 Women of Troy traveled to Oregon and beat the Ducks 3-1 for their eighth consecutive win. Redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme set a new program record by going 729 minutes without conceding a goal, handily beating the previous high mark of 655 minutes.
Sarah Kim | Daily Trojan Right out of the gate · Junior midfielder Sydney Sladek scored just a minute into the second half against Oregon, the first of two quick strikes.
The Women of Troy went end-to-end with the Ducks throughout the game, with both teams’ offenses challenging the opposition’s backline. But the Trojan front applied consistent pressure to the Oregon defense and looked threatening from the start.
USC broke the deadlock when redshirt senior Katie Johnson fought off a gang of Ducks and threaded a pass through the Oregon defense, releasing redshirt junior Alex Anthony in the penalty box. Junior goalkeeper Halla Hinriksdottir cut Anthony down, giving the Women of Troy a penalty. Senior Morgan Andrews stepped up and froze Hinriksdottir from the spot to put USC in the lead 20 minutes in.
Neither side scored for the rest of the first half, and the Women of Troy entered the intermission holding a 1-0 lead. It took less than three minutes after the restart for them to land the knockout blow to the Ducks.
Sophomore Leah Pruitt set up USC’s second goal when she charged down the left flank in the 46th minute and sliced the ball to Sydney Sladek at the edge of the 18-yard box. The junior midfielder uncorked a laser, hitting the top right corner to double the lead.
Almost immediately following Sladek’s goal, Andrews notched her second score of the game with another long-range effort from outside the 18-yard box. Pruitt got behind the defense and passed to Andrews, who took one touch on her teammate’s cutback before firing past Hinriksdottir again. Barely into the 47th minute, USC had suddenly tripled its half-time advantage.
Oregon responded to the Trojan outburst, ending Prudhomme’s shutout streak in the 76th minute. Sophomore Taylor Kuroda pounced on the loose ball when a corner pinballed around the penalty box, and she scored a consolation goal for the Ducks. Despite the end of the streak, Prudhomme still enjoyed a strong day in net, recording five saves, and the Women of Troy comfortably saw out the 3-1 victory.
The win put USC at 8-2 on the season and 2-0 in Pac-12 play. Arguably one of the hottest teams in the country right now, the Women of Troy will shoot for nine in a row on Sunday, when they travel to Corvallis to take on Oregon State.

The men’s water polo team, after finishing third place in the Mountain Pacific Invitational at UC Berkeley last weekend, will compete in the Lancer Invitational Friday against the Concordia Eagles and Fresno Pacific Sunbirds before coming back to USC on Saturday in a rematch with the No. 4 Pacific Tigers.
The No. 3 Trojans (9-1) suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of the Cal Golden Bears, falling 10-8 after trailing 8-3 in the fourth period.
Along with Cal’s home crowd presence, the Bears were able to control the game defensively with 24 straight minutes of perfect defense. Despite two straight wins against top-25 teams in Santa Clara (21-4) and Long Beach State (9-4), the Trojans defense failed against a balanced Cal attack that put up 6 goals in the first half.
In the tournament’s finale, Pacific was down, but never truly out. After USC surged ahead with a 3-0 lead, the Tigers mounted a comeback to put the game within a single goal. With USC’s 4-3 lead in the third period, junior driver Grant Stein and the Trojan offense scored four unanswered goals to win the game, 8-3.
Stein, USC’s leading scorer in the game with 2 goals and an assist, said after the third-place victory that Pacific’s offensive attack gave the USC defense some trouble.
“We knew they were wanting to get back at us after beating them last year. They have some European players that can shoot the ball pretty well, and we were definitely watching out for their lefties that can post up,” Stein said. “They’ve adopted a system similar to us at USC where after they get scored on. They use complicated centering plays that features driving motions and setting picks. Most other teams aren’t used to that.”
Head coach Jovan Vavic, who utilizes centering plays quite often, changed up his defensive approach accordingly on Sunday. The center-less strategy worked to perfection in the fourth period as the Men of Troy shutout a powerful Tiger offense that bested both Air Force and Stanford this past weekend.
But before the Trojans can play Pacific, they must first travel to Riverside Friday to play Concordia and Fresno Pacific.
Concordia, a small school in Irvine, possesses some size on their roster. Albeit unproven early in their regular season, the Eagles possess big athletes in 6-foot-7, two-meter Matthew Lange, 6-foot-5, two-meter and driver Josh Mundell and 6-foot-3 attacker Julian Meyers.
The last time USC and Concordia faced off, the Trojans trounced the Eagles with a barrage of goals in a 25-6 win that featured scores from 11 different players.
After Concordia, the Trojans will take on Fresno Pacific in the final game of the tournament.
With an 11-8 victory over No. 17 San Jose State, Fresno Pacific (4-4) has seen varied success in 2016.
Leading the way for the Sunbirds is team MVP David Maes, who has scored a team-high 22 goals off of 51 shot attempts with 14 steals. Behind Maes’ big arm is goalie Dillon Robinson, who has 64 saves as opposed to 68 goals allowed in six games.
Excluding their wins over San Jose State and Whittier, FPU has fallen to top-25 teams UC San Diego and Santa Clara by margins of 8.6 goals per game.
Even if Maes has a big game for Fresno, the USC offense could be too great for the Sunbirds to try and stop.
Saturday’s contest versus Pacific at home will be the game to watch. Though USC bested Pacific in their Sunday game, 25-goal scorers Engin Ege Colak and Luke Pavillard could sneak a couple past USC junior goalie McQuin Baron.
Opposite Baron will be Alen Osmanovic, who sports 145 saves, 5.6 goals against per game and an 11-2 record to his credit. Even if USC defeated Pacific on Sunday, the Tigers still have nine wins against top-25 squads and could drop USC.
USC’s junior utility player Mihajlo Milicevic hopes that USC’s home advantage could take Pacific entirely out of the game with their physicality and crowd support.
“They’re a very disciplined team, so it’s very hard to try and defend them. Besides that, they don’t have a big gun, and we are in better shape, so we can swim much faster than them,” Milicevic said. “It’s always nice to play at USC. I love it. We have a big crowd; it’s huge for us and it’s definitely an advantage.”

I’m not a fan of making comparisons in sports, whether it’s between players, coaches or teams. It’s absurd to compare players (LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan) or teams (the 72-win Chicago Bulls vs. the 73-win Golden State Warriors) who played in completely different time periods. But here’s one similarity that’s fair to point out across all sports and all eras: Historically great franchises are always expected to be great.
That’s a roundabout way of saying that USC football, for all its recent embarrassments and struggles, is and will always be a historically great program. And, by extension, whenever it is not great, everyone stops and stares.
Tal Volk | Daily Trojan Hot seat Helton · Clay Helton is off to a rocky start in his first season as the permanent head coach as USC has started off with a 1-3 record.
I’m working my way through Steve Delsohn’s new book, Cardinal and Gold: The Oral History of USC Trojans Football, which weaves a detailed story of the past 40 years of USC football, starting with former head coach John McKay’s departure in 1975. It’s a fascinating read, and it’s incredible to think that for decades on end, the Trojans were essentially a lock to make it to the Rose Bowl. Anything less was a disappointment, and 7-4 seasons would have alumni and boosters grumbling, wondering what the hell was going on.
That same grumbling is probably happening right now, with the team off to its worst start in 15 years and head coach Clay Helton beginning his career with four losses in five games. The conversations behind closed doors are likely not very pleasant at the moment, with people coming to grips with the fact that USC is indeed a team with a losing record.
It’s a parallel that I find striking when thinking of two long-running and dominant NBA franchises: the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers. Both franchises represent the pinnacle of basketball dynasties, yet both have had to undergo rough rebuilding periods in recent years. The Celtics have worked their way out, while the Lakers are still in the midst of it, but for both franchises, it started by acknowledging that — at least at the moment — they were not “great,” and needed to dedicate time to create change.
The Celtics are perhaps the model of how to start anew. After respected head coach Doc Rivers left for the Los Angeles Clippers in 2013 and the original “Big Three” era of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett came to an end, Boston hired Brad Stevens, a 36-year-old, baby-faced, unproven college coach to take over the hallowed position once held by Red Auerbach. It was a move that puzzled many — and a 25-57 debut season didn’t help — but given leeway to mold and shape the team, Stevens’ Celtics improved the following year, and last season finished with a 48-34 record to become one of the up-and-coming teams in the league.
The Lakers took a little longer to acquiesce after the debacle that was having Steve Nash and Dwight Howard come join Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol. They fired Mike Brown five games into the 2012-2013 season and inexplicably had Mike D’Antoni and Byron Scott run the team for three years under the illusion that they were still great and Kobe wasn’t on his last legs. But by hiring Luke Walton to coach in the post-Kobe era, the Lakers are taking a page out of the Celtics’ book. Walton is also 36 and relatively unproven. He did coach the Warriors briefly last season while head coach Steve Kerr was out, but this is his first test with a rebuilding team and a franchise finally recognizing that returning to greatness will be a process.
The hope is that USC will learn that as well. It’s true that there are differences between the college and pro games; you can’t tank in college for a higher draft pick, and you have the drawback of key players declaring for the draft every year. But the concept is the same: Just because the Trojans used to be a dynasty does not mean you can push a button and make USC great again.
This is a program not too far removed from heavy sanctions, has undergone four coaching changes in three years and has not been to a Rose Bowl in seven years. Helton has certainly done himself no favors with a mediocre start, but the Celtics didn’t fire Stevens after his first season and odds are the Lakers won’t give Walton the axe after his inevitably rough debut with a young roster.
The criticisms of Helton are valid. His in-game decisions have been routinely questionable, he has failed to utilize the full potential of the talent he has and under his watch, USC has disappointed in primetime game after primetime game.
And unlike the Celtics or Lakers, the Trojans are not in “rebuild” mode but instead supposed to compete for a Pac-12 Championship — but there we go with the inherent expectations again. Yes, old alumni and boosters grew up in an era where USC winning the Rose Bowl was just another season, but this is 2016, not 1979 or even 2008.
Everything is different — from the coaches to the players to the athletic director — but the naïve mindset that USC will keep “fighting on” and should always be a winning program just because it is USC is getting increasingly frustrating with every loss that points to the contrary.
Whether or not Helton is the right fit for USC at the moment is a separate topic. But instead of yelling, “Fire the coach” at the first sign of adversity, fans should look in the mirror and ask if their insecurity is based on the assumption that USC’s winning history should make it immune to losing and if what this program needs right now is another coaching firestorm.

When the USC football team makes its return to the Coliseum Saturday to take on Arizona State, it will be entering a stretch in which it plays four of its next five games at home.
Tal Volk | Daily Trojan Potential big blow · Offensive tackle Zach Banner could miss Saturday’s game against ASU with an ankle injury. It would be a substantial loss for an offensive line looking to maintain a strong run attack.
The Trojans (1-3) rounded out their week of preparation for the visiting Sun Devils (4-0) with a final practice on Thursday evening at Howard Jones Field.
Banner Headlines Injury Report
An ankle injury kept redshirt senior tackle Zach Banner mostly inactive throughout this week’s practices. While Banner did take the field for Thursday’s practice, he mostly stayed non-active in USC’s walkthrough-type workout.
Helton announced that Banner will be a game-time decision Saturday and is currently at “about 80 percent” health wise.
Banner’s ankle issue is another example of the injury woes the USC offensive line has undertaken this season. Junior center To’a Loebendahn had his 2016 season ended by an ACL/MCL tear and senior left tackle Chad Wheeler missed time earlier this season due to a heel injury.
Redshirt senior Jordan Simmons and sophomore Chuma Edoga have been splitting time during practice at right tackle should Banner not play against the Sun Devils Saturday.
Freshman cornerback Jack Jones is expected to play Saturday despite an ankle injury earlier in the week, according to Helton.
Sophomore running back Dominic Davis has been ruled out against ASU with an upper thigh contusion injury.
The Offense Cannot Settle
USC and ASU’s offenses have been polar opposites this season, production-wise. The Sun Devils possess the highest-scoring offense (48.8 PPG) in the Pac-12. Meanwhile, USC has the lowest-scoring offense in the conference (22 PPG).
Ball-control and the sustaining offensive drives have been main points of emphasis for the Trojans in preparing to face ASU.
“This is a game that I don’t think field goals are going to be good enough, and we’re stressing that to the offense,” head coach Clay Helton said. “The team that doesn’t turn the ball over and really performs best in the red zone is likely going to win this game.”
The Sun Devils have proven they can be explosive offensively for all four quarters; they scored 31 points in the fourth quarter in their 51-41 victory over Cal last week. USC must maintain the pace offensively throughout, it cannot afford to score only 3 points in the fourth quarter like it did against Utah last week.
Run Game Will Be Key 
ASU enters the Coliseum Saturday night with the third-best rushing attack in the Pac-12, averaging 236.5 yards per game  on the ground. Juniors Demario Richard and Kalen Ballage make up the Sun Devil backfield.
The USC defense will need to make a turnaround against ASU this Saturday, as it has surrendered the 10th-most rushing yards in the conference, allowing 194.8 yards a game on the ground to opposing offenses.
USC’s defensive line will be without sophomore Noah Jefferson this Saturday. Helton announced that Jefferson will be absent from playing in games until November as he deals with injuries and catches up academically.
The Trojans’ defense will be tasked with the duty of containing versatile ASU sophomore quarterback Manny Wilkins and the Sun Devil offense. In ASU’s win over Cal last week, Wilkins was 21-of-30 passing for 290 yards and a touchdown through the air; he also rushed for 72 yards and three scores.
“I think the biggest thing for [the defensive line] this week is not only stopping the run, but containing the quarterback I think is going to be huge,” Helton said. “When I look at Manny [Wilkins] and what he does, he’s just as dangerous in the dropback pass game running the ball as he is on designed runs.”

Sarah Kim | Daily TrojanDo the JuJu · Junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster broke out of his early season slump going for 89 yards on eight catches against Utah.Friday. Smith-Schuster leads the team in touchdowns with two.
On Saturday, the football team continues its difficult schedule, playing their second undefeated team in as many weeks. In just its second home game of the year, USC (1-3) will face an unranked ASU (4-0).
This will arguably be the toughest game the Sun Devils have played so far after playing Northern Arizona, Texas Tech and Cal at home as well as one road game against the University of Texas at San Antonio.
ASU has been handling its business and USC put a heavy focus on its defense during this week’s practices. The Sun Devils have the top-scoring offense in the conference while averaging 48.8 points per game. This is also the seventh-highest offensive average in the FBS.
Additionally, the team is averaging 21.7 points in the fourth quarter, meaning USC will have to seal the deal if they get an early lead, something they failed to do last week against Utah. The Sun Devils have scored all 18 trips they have made to the red zone. This offensive barrage will be a challenge for a USC team that ranks seventh in the conference in total defense.
The men behind the scoring flurries have been redshirt sophomore quarterback Manny Wilkins and a strong running back corps, including juniors Demario Richard and Kalen Ballage.
“I’m beyond impressed with Manny Wilkins and his pocket sense of being able to create off pass attempts,” head coach Clay Helton said. “He’s as good as I’ve seen thus far in that area.”
Wilkins has thrown for 1,085 yards with 5 touchdowns and three interceptions while going 84-125 on the season. He is also the second-leading rusher for the Sun Devils having accrued 312 yards on 56 attempts with 4 touchdowns.
“One of the things that stands out to you immediately is their up-tempo offense,” Helton said. “They are putting up 80-plus plays a game.”
The high-tempo offense has translated into a high-scoring machine and the top two running backs will pose a problem for the Trojans if their front seven struggles to stop the ball they way it did against Utah. Richard has 356 yards on the season and is averaging 3.9 yards per carry. He also has 1 touchdown.
One of the most dynamic performances in the country this season came from Ballage who tied the FBS record for most touchdowns in a game after scoring 8 against Texas Tech. Ballage is averaging 6.4 yards per carry and has 285 total yards to complement his 9 touchdowns on the year.
Part of containing the explosive offense will involve quarterback pressure, something the team has focused on this week after failing to register a sack against Utah last week. Due to the pace of the Sun Devils, Helton said he expects to see more playing time from freshman defensive ends Connor Murphy and Oluwole Betiku and junior inside linebacker Olajuwon Tucker.
Offensively, redshirt freshman Sam Darnold is starting his first game in the Coliseum, and even though he admitted to feeling some nerves before last week’s game, he is preparing as normal for Saturday’s matchup.
“They’re a really good football team, a really good bunch,” Darnold said. “Obviously late in games, what you saw in that Cal game with two late interceptions, that was obviously huge for them. It’s a great football team, we’re just looking to execute and play our style ball.”
The Sun Devils have the toughest run defense in the conference, allowing only 95 yards per game, but have the worst pass defense, giving up 404 yards per game. Helton said he wants senior tailback Justin Davis to get 20-25 carries this game, but if ASU stifles the run game, Darnold will have to find his receivers.
Against Power-5 teams, the Trojans have not thrown for a touchdown this season, but there were signs of life in the air against Utah with Darnold connecting with top receiver junior JuJu Smith-Schuster for eight catches and 98 yards.
“The whole game plan wasn’t set up around me, but there were plays that were made for me,” Smith-Schuster said. “A lot of the plays were nine-yard stop routes and with the defense they were playing, I was allowed to get the ball more.”
Smith-Schuster and company face the Sun Devils in a 5:30 p.m. clash in the Coliseum. The game is also being televised on FOX.

Photo courtesy of Jessica MajorProduction value · Seniors Zachary Roozen (left) and Jonathan von Mering (right) will perform in the play A Lie of the Mind. The 1985 play by Sam Shepard explores themes of love, abuse and family dysfunction.
The USC School of Dramatic Arts will perform Sam Shepard’s “savage masterwork” A Lie of the Mind this weekend.
The 1985 play is set in Montana, and opens with a troubling picture of protagonist Beth’s abuse at the hands of her husband, Jake. The effects of his abuse rip through both of their families and lead to an intense stand-off. Shepard blows up small-town jealousy and resentment into a four-hour deep exploration of domestic violence and mental illness with characteristic wryness and incision.
Stage manager Jessica Major, a senior majoring in theatre, spoke about her excitement for the design of the play.
“It’s a very simple set, but it’s perfect for the production,” she said.
The play centers around stark characters and bleak, unfiltered dialogue. An especially notable set piece is an illuminated moon — an important symbol in the play — built by USC students, which hangs ominously above the stage.
All of the actors and crew involved in A Lie of the Mind are students in this year’s senior BFA class. Shepard’s play was selected because the same class workshopped the play during their freshman year. Now, they have a chance to revisit the play as a cast using the skills that they have honed at the School of Dramatic Arts.
The play presents a formidable challenge to actors.
“It’s a black comedy about two families that really have no idea what’s going on,” Major said. “It’s a dark production.”
But the cast is excited to perform their capstone project. Major expressed her pride in the work that the students have put into the thematically challenging play, promising attendees many great moments of spectacular acting.
Seasoned actor and playwright Alan Freeman, a retired Occidental College professor, worked this semester as a part-time faculty member to direct A Lie of the Mind.
Major expressed that working with Freeman has been a rewarding experience for the students.
“He’s retired now, so our play is his sole focus. He’s given it everything,” Major said.
Freedman’s credentials include having served as the producing artistic director of the award-winning Occidental Theater Festival and more than 70 assorted directorships. His familiarity with the off-Broadway scene that brought up Shepard and his experience working with college students has served USC’s production of A Lie of the Mind well.
Major hopes that the play will have good attendance this weekend, since it is one of the first two productions of the fall season.
“I think everyone should come see it, even if it’s just to learn something about Montana,” she said.
USC’s run of the play began Thursday night and continues with four performances this weekend at the on-campus Scene Dock Theatre, including matinees on Saturday and Sunday. The Saturday afternoon performance will be followed by a lecture from acclaimed USC professor and resident playwright Velina Hasu Houston, who will speak about the play’s representation of gender issues as well as the stylistic links Shepard’s writing shares with the American poetry tradition.
Tickets are $5 for students, $8 for faculty and staff and $12 for general admission. Times can be found on the School of Dramatic Arts’ website.

Sydney Park | Daily TrojanMilk and honey · Poet Rupi Kaur enchanted audiences with a live reading of her most well-received poems at Bovard Auditorium Thursday night. She ended the night with a book signing after her performance.
At 7 p.m., a long line of students stretched along Trousdale Parkway for a night of snapping, listening, singing and crying with poet and spoken word artist Rupi Kaur.
The event “An Evening With Rupi Kaur,” was a live reading and book signing from Kaur’s New York Times bestselling book Milk and Honey. The event was hosted by the USC Academic Culture Assembly for USC Mental Health Awareness Month, a flagship program that “aims to raise awareness for mental health and fight the stigma associated with mental health.” The evening was also co-sponsored by the USC Women’s Student Assembly.
Kaur came on the stage and started the night with the excitement of teenager, but a wisdom way beyond her 23 years.
“Everyday a new person is becoming inside me, I think this is what growth feels like,” she began, with a soft and slow voice, referring to how detached she felt from the version of herself who wrote Milk and Honey in 2014. “What do you say when the book with your name on it is so beyond your name, how do you reflect on a creation so natural it spilled out of you like blood?” 
Kaur answered her own question, “When the poems came like poets, I pulled the words out of me. Like the remains of a gunshot. I had no choice.”
The night was divided into four parts. The first was heavier, focusing on sexual abuse, rape and trauma.
“I am so tired of doing things your way.  Sun can’t stop the storm from coming. The tree can’t stop the axe,” Kaur said, in an exasperated tone. “I can’t blame me for having a hole the size of your manhood in my chest anymore. It’s too heavy to carry your guilt, so I’m setting it down.” 
The other parts were more lighthearted and geared toward healing and self-love.
“A lot of people always ask me, especially if being South Asian, if it’s always taboo to talk about sex on stage,” Kaur said.
The audience cheered. Kaur mentioned how people don’t know why it’s necessary to say these things. She said it’s necessary because after a traumatic experience there’s survival and love is proof of it.
“It won’t not be love at first sight when we meet, it will be love at first remembrance,” she sighed. “’Cause I have seen you in my mother’s eyes when she tells me to marry the type of man I want to raise my son to be like.” She advised women out there to know what type of man they are looking for and that if he compares other women, he is the wrong person.
“If he can’t help but degrade other women when they’re not looking, if toxicity is central to his language, he could hold you in his lap and be soft,” she said. “Honey, that man could feed you sugar and douse you in rose water but that could still not make him sweet.” The most magical and riveting moment of the night was when Kaur recited her poem “Questions,” with blue lights swirling around like snowflakes and classical music blasting throughout Bovard Auditorium.
Her poems serve as a platform for helpless voices and as a reminder that after destruction, it is possible for one to piece themselves together back again.
Rupi Kaur took her audience on a journey of hurting, loving, breaking and healing. Not only did she charm the audience with her voice, humor and sensitivity, but she also gave an even greater message — the importance of finding sweetness in bitter moments.

On Sept. 28, 2015, Oh Wonder performed their first-ever American show to a crowd of just under 250 people. Exactly one year later, the duo performed a sold-out show Wednesday at The Wiltern to a crowd of over 2,300.
 It is crazy the difference a year can make — that was a big theme of the show. Duo Josephine Vander Gucht and Anthony West thanked the crowd at least half a dozen times during the set for everyone’s support. While Oh Wonder’s relative unfamiliarity with the scene was obvious, it added a certain charm to the show.
 By opening with “Livewire,” then quickly moving onto “Dazzle,” Oh Wonder snagged the crowd’s attention quickly after an underwhelming opening act by Kevin Garrett. 
While Garrett had considerable musical talent, his performance, which consisted of him standing adjacent to the audience playing a keyboard, left much to be desired. People in the crowd, who were clearly there to see the headliner, shuffled around on their phones during his 20-minute opener.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanTechnicolour beat · London-based alt-pop duo Oh Wonder wrote, recorded and released a single every month on Soundcloud leading up to the release of their self-titled debut Oh Wonder. Josephine Vander Gucht and Anthony West have been praised for their nontraditional approach to making the album.
In comparison, Oh Wonder’s first two tracks immediately caught the audience’s attention. After each song, Vander Gucht giggled into the microphone and beamed smiles out at the crowd.  
She was ecstatic to be playing throughout the entire set. This happiness and excitement was reinforced by the speech she gave after the next two songs, “Lose It” and “Shark.” 
“You are all very special,” she said. “There are tiny seeds of magic inside all of you. From small goals to massive adventures, anything is possible.”
Unfortunately, the girlish charm that made Vander Gucht so likeable didn’t work the same with West. He spoke once during the show, after their next song, “Without You.” West sounded slightly exhausted, but perhaps he was a little shy. 
After performing a variety of their most popular songs during these first half of the show, Oh Wonder slid into a bit of a rut. “All We Do,” “Landslide” and “Plans,” came next, and the crowd’s energy began to wane.  
The pair’s performance of the three songs were good, but should have been spaced between other high-energy songs to keep the audience more engaged.
The Wiltern’s architecture and high ceilings were a beautiful setting for the show — and the set design on stage didn’t try to compete. Large, LED letters that spelled out the duo’s abbreviation “OW” stood behind the two singers, while five vertical light poles were spaced on either side of the stage. While the lights created a cool photo opp, it also allowed for the audience to place more focus on the duo’s music.
Then, the musicians had a surprise up their sleeve — a never-before-heard song. The unnamed ballad was slow and emotional, about the pains of leaving friends and family to travel and tour around the world.
“All my friends … can I beat within your heart?” Vander Gucht and West sang.
And, perhaps as a testament to how loyal their fanbase is, shushes ran through the audience as everyone listened (and attempted to record) the brand new song.
Afterward, Oh Wonder performed “Heart Hope,” “Body Gold” and “Drive,” which they claimed were their last three songs of the night. But the audience wasn’t ready for the duo to leave, and they weren’t one to leave its fans disappointed.
After a dramatic pause, Vander Gucht and West popped back onstage for a double encore of “Midnight Moon” and “Technicolour Beat.”
During “Mightnight Moon,” a confetti cannon went off, the floor-rumbling bass beat of “Technicolor Beat,” coupled with the heartbeat-imitating lights made it an ending to remember, even if overall the show lacked an interesting stage design.
Oh Wonder didn’t need gimmicks to carry themselves. The music talent held by both members — who played keyboard in addition to singing for the entire show — was evident. The music was by far the most important element of the show, and it was beautifully performed  in a concert hall with amazing acoustics.

False eyelashes are the equivalent to the killer leather jacket or pair of shoes you need to wear when dressing up — simple on its own, yet capable of turning you from “clean” to “on-point.” Better yet, accessories like these not only make you look good, but also feel good. 
So when my dear friend — who I will call Jackson for the purpose of anonymity — tells me to put my “falsies” on, he’s essentially telling me to mentally prepare myself for some type of environment that will require extra social energy for a couple of hours.
Last weekend, Jackson told me to get my falsies on and an hour later, we went to a party. It was 11 p.m. and Jackson was game — he was hoping to get some drinks in and I was excited to witness the chaos of a college party. As I walked in with both leather jacket and falsies on, my expectations were immediately met.
String lights, red cups and blasting music. There were circles of people throughout the backyard, either yelling at each other over the music or just laughing together. To my right, I saw a few couples tucked away in a dark corner, getting friendly with each other or just eating each other’s faces. “Maybe the party ran out of chips?” I thought. To my left, a small table with drinks was surrounded by people taking shots together. But before I could further assess the scene and make way to investigate whether this party really ran out of food or not, “Mr. Dude” came my way. 
Caught off-guard and a little confused, Mr. Dude ignored my confused look and proceeded to initiate a conversation. Throughout his speech I thought to myself, “Why are you talking to me? Where are your friends? Where are MY friends?” 
As my initial joy from having expectations met slowly melted away, I was angry that Mr. Dude just ruined my energy. I didn’t come here to actually mingle, I came to observe and be with my friends. Mr. Dude was still talking. I don’t actually recall saying much besides, “No, you can’t kiss me.”
My intention for the night was to people watch, specifically Jackson hitting on girls and getting rejected (hopefully something Snapchat-worthy, too). Yet, the unwarranted encounter with Mr. Dude threw me off. I wasn’t trying to meet new people, but this guy and others kept approaching me with whatever they thought was interesting enough to engage me. 
I find it ironic that when I want to meet and mingle at parties, it becomes very difficult to meet people. But when I don’t want to have any attention on me at parties, people end up overwhelming me with meaningless conversation. On a bigger scale, why am I receiving attention from guys when I’m not looking for romance?
I believe Mr. Dude may have been attracted to my false eyelashes and leather jacket, or more importantly, that I was wearing my confidence on my sleeve. In these moments of not seeking, there was no need to impress anyone or put up a facade of being more than who I really am. 
My favorite outfit is this — comfortable. While falsies and leather jackets may be some of my favorite things in my closet, there’s nothing more flattering than fitting into what feels most in tune with myself. Confidence is also like my favorite perfume — while it can’t be store-bought, when it’s spritzed into the air I’ve found that it’s also a scent that other people are really into, too. It’s these things that allow me to not be too conscious of myself and rather be focused on the people and environment around me.
The best part of it all, however, is that comfortable and confident are a packaged deal. The two are pretty much synonymous; being comfortable and okay with yourself is a type of self-love that allows you to embrace your quirks and personal characteristics. So forget fretting over wearing something that Zara or Urban Outfitters may sell to be just for “you,” dig into the closet that you’re naturally equipped with and own it.

A recent article from the USC News website highlighted a nonprofit mentorship program entitled Teens Exploring Technology, which is making great strides in inspiring young minority males to pursue careers in technology. It has technology and coding programs, some of which meet at USC over the summer, which aim to teach young men the leadership, professional and interpersonal skills needed to succeed as adults.
What is so incredible about a program like this is that it is the notable absence of minorities in STEM fields. The STEM field is made up of a disproportionate amount of white and Asian males compared to minority males and women of all races. Women make up nearly half the workforce, but have just 26 percent of science, technology, engineering or math jobs, according to the Census Bureau. Furthermore, African Americans make up 11 percent of the workforce, but just 6 percent of such jobs, and Hispanics make up nearly 15 percent of the workforce, but hold 7 percent of those positions. 
One possible reason for this huge gender and racial gap in technology and engineering fields is the harsh stereotypes that prevent minorities and women from wanting to enter the field, as well as having access to an education that would provide them with the skills necessary to do so. Even those who are able to enter the field lack the proper mentorship and role models to look up to, which results in many choosing to leave the profession more often than their white and Asian male counterparts. 
One of the challenges faced by many lower-income African Americans and Hispanics is their limited access to a good education. A recent study showed that over half of Hispanic 4-year-olds are not enrolled in any preschool classes. While more than 60 percent of black 4-year-olds are enrolled, most of them are in programs of low quality. Some of this limited access to a quality education stems from entrenched stereotypes about who does well in science and math in classrooms. Too many teachers give up too easily on them simply because they are not expected to do as well as white students. Moreover, boys are more likely to spend more time in the community, with their peers, which leaves them more open to involvement in things like gang violence, another hindrance to education. 
Despite those challenges, many minorities still enroll in science and math programs in college, but fewer of them earn a degree in those programs within five years — 22.1 percent for Hispanics and 18.4 percent for blacks — than whites (33 percent) and Asians (42 percent), according to a study by researchers at UCLA. Many of those who leave are simply ill-prepared for the rigors of college-level math and science. Others feel socially unwelcome because they make up a tiny minority in largely white and Asian science and engineering departments. 
These negative stereotypes not only affect minorities’ entrance into the STEM field, but women’s as well. According to Ariane Hegewisch, a director for the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, young girls do not get as much of an opportunity to use computers as boys do in elementary schools. When making choices about their majors and careers, many young women rule out engineering and computer science partly because they are uninterested, feel ill-prepared for them or because society tends to identify the STEM field as male-dominated. Women who pursue careers in the STEM field are much more likely to leave the profession than men. Furthermore, the women who graduate with degrees in engineering and computer science are less likely to be employed than men.
In many cases, women seem to have internalized society’s belief that they are incapable of mastering these fields as well as men. Psychologists from Stanford University, among other scholars, have found that female students who are made to believe that math ability is innate have lower scores and are less likely to study math than girls who believe that math skills can be acquired through hard work. Another study showed that “female college students got more questions right on math tests when they were told beforehand that ‘college students are good at math’ than when they were told ‘women are bad at math,’” which suggests stereotypes undermine women’s performance.
The lack of minorities and women in the STEM field is largely due to negative stereotypes that discourage these populations from entering technology and engineering professions. These stereotypes inhibit students’ academic achievements and educational opportunities to succeed.
Improving the representation of women and minorities would enrich American scientific research and development, because they will add a different perspective to workplaces currently dominated by white and Asian men.

Julia, 
For starters, you are a history, social sciences major, and it’s obvious they’re not STEM. So you don’t speak from experience. Secondly, all my Asian American friends from high school who had honors/AP math and science classes, who went to top undergrad schools like Ucla, Cal, UC SD for the trite “pre-med” didn’t make it. Even they struggled through B,C,P,M classes.  Your assertion is specious. The race card, social pressures, stereotypes, etc. do not discourage “disadvantaged” minorities from STEM. They lack strong fundamentals in math and science. Even the kids from “advantaged” backgrounds i.e. suburban high schools, get beat up in collegiate STEM classes.
You should get off the race-card bandwagon. This whole student activism, identity politics stuff is just over-the-top….And if you were a STEM major, I doubt you’d write this piece.

USC might have a drinking problem.
Yesterday, we published an article, “To the Brim: How USC is fighting a stubborn culture of binge drinking,” detailing the ways the University hopes to stem the tide of dangerous drinking behavior that is putting students’ lives at risk. 
Based on numbers collected from a 2014-2015 AlcoholEdu Impact Report, nearly a third of undergraduates are participating in “high-episodic” drinking, classified as five or more drinks in males and four or more drinks in females in a short time period, by 45 days into the semester. And in the first few weeks of this semester alone, there have been nearly 50 instances of alcohol-related transports. Most of these cases involved first-year students under the legal drinking age. 
But these numbers can only frame part of the problem. Numbers can’t identify why a pervasive binge-drinking problem exists. Numbers can’t offer solutions. The University aims to fill that void with revised policy, regulation and alternative programming. Parents and outside spectators look to administrators to see how USC is going to fix student’s dangerous habits. The agency there, however, is severely misplaced. 
The problem is not a lack of enforcement or rules. The problem is us. 
See, USC can always do more. More rules, more activities, more policing and more education. 
But at what point do we, as students and members of this campus community, take some of that responsibility? At what point do we tell ourselves, “It’s time to change?”
It’s time. We need to stop relying on others to tell us how and when to change, and take actual steps toward a healthier relationship with alcohol.
Most of us don’t come to college with this behavior — not even close. Incoming freshmen don’t arrive at USC with an innate binge-drinking culture mentality. In fact, according to the aforementioned report, 59 percent of incoming freshmen arrive as non-drinkers. But at that 45-day mark, it’s down to 44 percent.   
At USC, it is undeniable that drinking is embedded in our campus culture. On game days, tailgates happen directly under the windows of freshman dorms as early as the first weekend of fall semester. Parties abound throughout both the Row and off-campus houses that often cater to both underage and excessive drinking behavior, offering those living under University housing jurisdiction a place to escape from residential policy. 
It’s on us, then, to create an environment where we all work to reduce dangerous binge-drinking activity. It’s on us to create a culture where taking five shots before heading to the main event isn’t considered the norm. 
This can all be done in small but monumental ways.
To create a safer community, students should embrace the amnesty policy, which allows for reporting of alcohol-related incidents without the threat of punishment, and keep other people safe as well as ourselves. We’re all affected by binge-drinking culture as students, and when we see our peers drink too much, we can’t choose to ignore the signs to avoid disciplinary action. 
Alcohol poisoning comes in many forms. Recognizing what it looks like, how to prevent it and what to do if you encounter it are fundamental to eradicating a stubborn drinking culture.
And when students do drink, consider the happy medium between sobriety and blacking out. Pacing the party is much more beneficial than front loading all of your alcohol intake at the pregame. 
Ultimately, the power lies with us to reverse the momentum on a dangerous drinking culture that has pervaded university life for two decades. The question now is, are we up to the task?

Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
Most people who study abroad don’t do it for the academics. They do it to expand their horizons in other ways — to travel, to live independently, and to immerse themselves in another culture.
But there’s another compelling reason to study abroad, and that’s to be a student of another place — of another institution, of another country, and of another people.
This past week, I’ve been slammed with work. I’ve had to write four papers and make a presentation on topics ranging from the implications of Brexit on Scotland’s economy to the prospects of Scottish independence.
And it’s been fantastic. They are all reminders that just as studying abroad can be culturally and individually enriching, it can also be a place of intense academic enrichment as well. For a public policy and economics student like me, to learn about political economy in a place as intellectually interesting as Scotland is a blessing. Since I’m in the Parliamentary Programme, all of our classes are geared toward preparing us for our internship at the Scottish Parliament, which starts in a couple weeks. That means that our classes are a bit like an intense bootcamp about issues in Scottish and UK politics.
To be learning about cutting-edge issues in Scottish politics to which the world is paying close attention — Brexit and the possibility of an independent Scotland, for instance —is a great intellectual feat.
There is such an inescapable culture of scholarship here in my classes at the University of Edinburgh. Professors are intensely interactive with students, class isn’t long but relies on close individual reading, and the professors engage students fiercely by asking and answering questions. When I conduct research for my papers, I keep seeing the names of my professors pop up in interviews at various publications, and I’m reminded that they are the world’s leading scholars in Scottish politics.
It’s something that makes me so excited, as a student and a scholar, to be a sponge in every way — culturally, socially, politically and academically. Cultural involvement lends itself to more academic involvement, and academic engagement informs the way I interact with the culture around me. It’s an experiment that relies on great immersion of every proportion.
Sonali Seth is a junior studying public policy and economics in Scotland this semester.
Good article. After graduating from USC in 1992, I attended the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain. I picked a program where I was totally integrated in the Spanish culture and language. It was a bit challenging at first, but I picked up Spanish quickly and have used my experiences there in my professional career.

I chose probably the worst time to go vegan in my entire life – a month into my freshman year at college. I mean, seriously? Did I actually consider the fact that I had to eat out of the on campus dining halls…..? Clearly not, and I quickly realized that living off peanut butter toast and sugary granola with soy milk wasn’t so sustainable…
That said, I was more motivated by my decision to go vegan than I was by EVK’s way-too-cheesy-cheese-pizza, and begun to expand my sources of affordable vegan food around LA. 
And wow, did I find a lot!
So, without further ado, it’s time I spread this love onto all you vegan/vegetarian/foodies here at USC! Every two weeks I will bring to you another amazing location of vegan food right here in LA for you to go out and enjoy for yourself!
To start things off with a bang, I did as I always do: dessert first.
Introducing, Pressed Juicery – Freeze!
Yes, Juice Press has now created a frozen juice bar, where you can get all your greens or chocolatey juices in fro-yo style, with healthy toppings such as granola, berries, coconut flakes, cacao syrup and so much more…
Photo Courtesy of Annie Hickey
These treats are super affordable (I know, ‘pressed juices’ have a reputation for being so overpriced, but these desserts are seriously worth every penny), and they’re so good for you, too! All the ingredients used are those that would be in their actual juices (i.e., cleansing and delicious), plus you can top it and design it however you like!!
Unfortunately, not all the Pressed Juicery locations are equipped with the incredible Freeze machines, but given our steaming hot weather right now (sorry, is it Summer?), I can 100% guarantee that you will not regret making the effort!
All of the Freeze locations are listed here! 
So go off, enjoy your desserts, take some totally Instagram-worthy snaps, make everyone jealous, and keep an eye out for the next location of delicious cruelty-free indulgences!

In July, Fergie released the music video to her new track, titled “M.I.L.F.$.” Now, this isn’t the American Pie acronym as we know it — Fergie has redefined M.I.L.F. as “Moms I’d Like To Follow.” Though Fergie claims the message of her song is about “empowering women who do it all,” the music video ironically hypersexualizes women and their consumption of milk.
 Similar to Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda,” the Fergie video features a concupiscent “Milfman,” who lusts after dancing celebrity moms. However, the message of female empowerment gets lost in the overwhelming parts of the video that, absent of sound, can be mistaken for high-class porn.
 What really caught me off guard was the allusion to “Got Milk,” the American advertising campaign that vigorously promoted the consumption of cow’s milk through celebrity ads from 1993 to 2014. After an abrupt ending, the song resumed for its last hurrah, as a TV appeared with a twist on the iconic “Got Milk” campaign reading “got milf?” Following this message was what seemed to be a revival of the “Got Milk” campaigns — Fergie seductively poured milk all over her body while the other mothers drank milk and sported the infamous milk mustaches, perpetuating the myth that cow’s milk is a vital source of calcium and protein for bone and muscle growth.
 In contrast to the school curriculums that necessitate dairy as part of the food pyramid, Fergie taught her students about alternative milk substitutes as she played the role of a (sexy schoolgirl) teacher for a nutrition class. The list on the board included the terms almond, coconut, rice, hemp, soy, dairy, protein, calcium and calories.
Though it’s unclear whether Fergie intended to endorse dairy — they could have been consuming almond milk — the lascivious use of the milk alluded “Got Milk” and the support of money-hungry dairy companies.
The dairy industry is horrific. Since female cows only lactate when they’re pregnant or have a newborn to feed, dairy workers repeatedly artificially inseminate them starting at the age of 12 months to continually keep them pregnant. Confined to what the industry calls “rape racks,” the workers send tubes with bull semen up the female cow’s vaginas. Sometimes the workers even stick their fists inside the cows to loosen the area.
When a female cow gives birth, the vicious cycle repeats itself. Female cows are taken from their mothers and raised to be milk machines, and male cows are slain before being sold as veal. The anguish the mother cow faces after having her babies torn from her sometimes results in days of continuous moans as she searches for her newborns.
The habitual insemination of female cows results in premature aging, exhaustion and mastitis — inflammation and sometimes infection of the udder. Pus and blood is commonly found in cow’s milk and is filtered, but not always completely. In the U.S., 750,000 somatic cells are allowed per milliliter. Somatic cells, which in this case are mostly white blood cells, are the same as the pus that erupts from a giant zit.
After usually four to five years of incessant exploitation, the female cow collapses, and is then taken to the meat industries to be slaughtered and sold as meat. 
Aside from the explicit abuse, dairy has time again proved to be detrimental to our health. In fact, the USDA, responsible for creating the food pyramid guidelines, had a team of their scientists look into the scientific basis of the claims made in the “milk mustache” ads. The department revealed that milk doesn’t actually benefit sports performance. It also stated that dairy is linked to prostate cancer and heart diseases and causes digestive problems for 75 percent of people with lactose intolerance (maybe because humans aren’t meant to consume cow’s milk!). Finally, a more well-known fact is that countries with the lowest rates of dairy and calcium consumption — Africa and Asia, for instance — have the lowest rates of osteoporosis.
Needless to say, you can get all of the calcium and protein you need from plant-based sources, such as kale, spinach, almonds,tofu, tempeh, tahini, beans, bread and broccoli.
While Got Milk’s campaign should have been called Got Beastiality or Got Pus, Fergie was spot on with “Got Milf,” as she’s proved with her 112 million Youtube views that sex sells.
However, had Fergie continued to extend upon the message of female empowerment, she could have sparked social change for females — both women, by delving into the celebrities’ success as leading figures — and cows, by advocating for plant-based milks.

Toronto-based pop singer Shawn Mendes answered questions and performed an intimate show for fans at the Grammy Museum on Tuesday night to promote his sophomore album Illuminate.
Two years ago, Mendes released his first single “Life of the Party,” which made him the youngest artist ever to debut in the Top 25. Since then, he has toured with fellow singers Austin Mahone and Taylor Swift, released two albums and is preparing for an international tour in spring 2017.
“There are these random moments for me, and I just got overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. You don’t feel it walking off the stage,” Mendes said during the Q&A session. “You feel the adrenaline and excitement, but you don’t feel the actual mass of what’s happening to you.” Mendes has performed on the highest grossing tour of 2015, and one of the highest in history — Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour.
“Every time I step on a stage and perform, it feels like the first time,” he said. “I feel like every aspect of me as a human being I leave on that stage every night. That’s what makes it beautiful, but that’s what makes it so hard at times.” The 18-year-old’s nerves were evident when he answered the host and audience’s questions. However, the moment that the guitar came out, an air of maturity overcame the musician and his powerful voice and talent echoed throughout the room.
Mendes played eight songs to the intimate crowd at the Clive Davis Theater inside the Grammy Museum. The artist’s talented hands glided across the piano, as he performed renditions of the two songs that made him famous — “Life of the Party” and “Stitches.” He then brought out an acoustic guitar and performed “Three Empty Words,” a song depicting the story of two people falling out of love.
 After a stripped down version of “Like This,” Mendes brought out the electric guitar for the two edgier songs that signalled a departure from his previously strictly pop ballads: “Ruin” and “Don’t Be A Fool.” Following this was the highest energy song of the night, “Treat You Better,” during which Mendes was dancing around the stage, laughing with the audience, obviously having the time of his life. He concluded with a mellow, emotional performance of “Mercy,” in which he showcased the development of his voice and the maturity in his range.
Mendes spoke about his creative process and why he believed he found his success as an artist.
“The only difference between me, and [my friend] Scott, from my hometown, who plays guitar and is great at singing, is that I was willing to accept creativity and accept what came out of me, without being judged.” Mendes said. “We just sit in [the studio] and you can’t sing a wrong song, sing a wrong melody, play a wrong chord. You just let it come to you, and that’s when true art is created, when you’re no longer critiquing yourself or worried about what other people are saying.” 
Mendes cited singer Ed Sheeran as his biggest inspiration. Sheeran has influenced Mendes from the very beginning of his career.
“I was obsessed with his songs, his lyrics, his stories,” he said. “When I met him a long, long time ago, he said to me, ‘It’s not a game; if you want to be successful, just work hard.’”
He also noted Swift as a role model for his work ethic.
“Even at the top of the game, No. 1 artist in the world, she works harder than anything else,” he said. “No amount of success that allows you to stop working hard.”
Mendes’ performance was proof of his potential to make strides in pop music and the music industry.

It was a light bulb moment for Brendan Sindell.
 It clicked shortly before he decided to attend USC for his Master’s degree in business administration, and that spur-of-the-moment idea has now evolved into his lifestyle for the past five years. USC alumnus Brendan Sindell is the founder of House Beer, a Los Angeles beer company established in 2013 with a mission to provide its consumers with tasty, high-quality brew.
 When asked how the idea came to him, Sindell said beer has always been something in the back of his mind. His undergraduate college experience was at UCSB, and he dubbed it “a party school.” Yet, Sindell took a thing or two out of the college party scene that contributed to his future start-up: his acquired taste for beer.
 At every college party and sporting event, beer was always in high demand. However, one thing was missing for him —  it just wasn’t good beer. To Sindell, it was unsatisfying alcohol bought in copious amounts with no purpose other than to get people drunk.
 The light-bulb moment came to him one summer day, during a conversation with a fellow beer enthusiast. After receiving his undergraduate degree, Sindell was working at an investment advisory firm, with graduate school the only clear destination in his future. He hadn’t thought about launching his own craft beer before, but soon after that fateful conversation, the idea grew on him.
 “I wanted to create beer using great ingredients — beers that were great for drinking, high in quality, but also something that won’t leave you too full,” Sindell said.
 For two years, Sindell taught himself all he could about the beer industry while brainstorming his start-up, applying for graduate school and handling work.
 In the beginning, it was all a blur: talking to the right people, asking questions, researching about beer — a daily routine that led to the advent of House Beer.
 Graduate school had always been in the equation for Sindell, and he had his mind set on Marshall’s masters program. As a Los Angeles native, he wanted to build a professional network around Southern California, and USC provided that perfect opportunity for a burgeoning entrepreneur. He began attending night classes in 2012 while spending the day working on the start-up. Sindell attributes many successful aspects of House Beer to his time at Marshall.
 “I learned everything from pricing strategy, positioning my product in the marketplace, to managing a team of people,”  Sindell said.
 It’s helped him tremendously, he acknowledged, though there were rough patches at the start of his journey.
 “When you’re 23, 24, trying to figure out how to start up a company … there’s all this red tape and licensing behind alcohol. It was definitely overwhelming at times,” he said. “I didn’t have anyone to turn to.” Sindell’s family weren’t beer connoisseurs. In fact, his mother hates beer and his father, a retired professor, wasn’t into beer or its business aspects.
 It was a different story with his siblings. In the beginning, his older half-brother Derek Wilson pitched in financially as Sindell put in some of his own money, and they drew some funds from friends and family. Sindell’s two brothers and friend Keegan Gibbs are his co-founders, and together, they found the team that would make up House Beer.
 “Initially, it was finding people who believed in me and who believed in the brand,” Sindell said.
 Though House Beer is now expanding, their mission remains the same: high quality, refreshing drinkable beer.
 Despite its growth in the last three years, he remains humble on his progress with House Beer. “It’s still a start-up,” he said. “It’s a roller coaster for sure.”
 To Sindell, House Beer will continue to be a work in progress, with uncertainties coupled with successes. There are moments when he feels like he’s on top of the world, and then days when the reality of working in a million-dollar beer industry comes crashing down on him.
 “That’s the life of an entrepreneur,” Sindell said.
 He’s looking forward to what that life has to offer, but his entrepreneurial roots will always stem back to the Trojan Family.

While Oxford is most known for the birthplace of rock legend Radiohead, the city recently gave birth to a fresh, alternative rock band — Foals.
The band graced the stage at the Hollywood Palladium Tuesday evening, performing a lively and unforgettable show. With sounds very similar to the Arctic Monkeys, The Wombats and Arcade Fire, Foals fits perfectly into the alternative rock scene that has built many successful band careers. Kiev, a dreamy indie rock band from Orange County, and Bear Hands, a post-punk indie band from Brooklyn, performed opening acts prior to the concert.
The five-person band began in 2005 after their respective bands broke up, with lead vocalist and guitarist Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan coming from the math rock group The Edmund Fitzgerald, guitarist Walter Gervers and bassist Jimmy Smith coming from the group Face Meets Grill, and the addition of keyboard player Edwin Congreave.
Since its inception, Foals has released four albums, including Antidotes in 2008, Total Life Forever in 2010, Holy Fire in 2013, and its most recent album What Went Down in 2015, which contains the hit song “Mountain at My Gates.”
As Foals emerged onstage they started the night with an instrumental introduction, tantalizing the audience and building the energy as they soon transitioned into a rock-and-roll interlude. Heavy drums and bass filled the room, with colorful strobe lights flashing to every drum beat, getting the crowd jumping around with excitement.
Amanda Verdadero | Daily TrojanFriend or foal · Alternative band Foals performed at the Hollywood Palladium on Tuesday evening. The band released its fourth studio album, What Went Down, in 2015. Lead vocalist Yannis Philippakis (above) engaged with fans by crowd surfing through the audience.
The energy kept expanding as the band played “Olympic Airways” from their first album, causing the audience to clap along to the dreamy guitar riffs and sing every word. This then merged into the bassline of the groovy hit, “My Number.” If fans weren’t singing along before, they certainly were during “My Number,” chanting back the “ohs” to each chorus and dancing along to the infectious bass line. Frontman Yannis Philippakis worked the crowd with his stellar rock and roll moves and crazy guitar solos.
“Nothing in my domestic sphere, my normal sphere, exists any more [during a performance],” Philippakis said in an interview with the Guardian. “But it’s definitely something I know is there — it’s not something I’ve invited in. It’s not role play, it’s from within me.”
Philippakis’ sincerity resonated, especially during slower songs like “A Knife In The Ocean,” where stunning lighting and carefully crafted melodies helped the audience connect to the band’s vulnerability.
Overall spirits remained at a high throughout the night, with the band jamming out together and dominating the stage. Yet, the night could not be complete without Philippakis’ signature stage dive into the audience during the band’s encore performance. The band’s contagious energy seeped into the audience, even inspiring a fan to follow the frontman’s lead and crowd surf, ultimately ending the night with a bang.

A suspect who broke into a student apartment earlier this week is currently being held by LAPD under charges of burglary.
At around 5 a.m. on Sept. 26, Josiah Payne, 27, broke into a student apartment on West 27th Street and fled with some belongings, according to the Department of Public Safety. 
Payne seems to be suffering from a sort of mental illness, as his reportedly strange behavior was not the result of drugs. He is not affiliated with USC.
 The victim of the theft and a witness said that the man entered while they were asleep and proceeded to search through kitchen cabinets. 
They proceeded to lock themselves in the bathroom and call 911.
 Payne was also observed carrying a knife and vandalizing a fifth-floor study room in the building. 
 When DPS officers reviewed a surveillance video from the apartment complex, the DPS detective sergeant recognized the suspect, who was then detained and sent for mental health evaluation. Payne is currently in the custody of LAPD. 
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle emphasized the importance of reporting suspicious activity to DPS, as well as taking other measures to increase safety. 
“What I’d like to emphasize to students is that safety is a shared responsibility,” said DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. “We want students to do their part to stay safe, and that means… making sure to hide their valuables, lock their doors at night, and just take reasonable precautions to stay safe. If they see something that doesn’t seem right, [then] it probably isn’t.”

Following a nearly yearlong, nationwide search, Ambassador David Lane has been chosen as the next president of the Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands. Lane previously served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies in Rome. He succeeds USC Annenberg professor Geoffrey Cowan, who stepped down in June after serving six years as the inaugural president of Sunnylands.
“Sunnylands has the potential to bring people together across ideological boundaries,” Lane said. “People are willing to let down their guard, put aside some of their assumptions and biases and be more open. The goal is to link the great experts and evidence and research that’s out there and help ensure that it’s being translated into policy.”
Sunnylands is the sprawling, 200-acre desert estate in Rancho Mirage, California, which served as the winter home of Ambassador Walter Annenberg and his wife Leonore, after whom the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is named. Following their deaths in 2002 and 2009, respectively, the estate’s board of trustees established the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands, a retreat center for government officials and private sector experts. Dubbed “Camp David of the West” by Cowan, and in the spirit of the Annenbergs’ vision for the estate, Sunnylands has hosted several high-profile meetings, including a 2013 summit between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a 2014 meeting with Obama and King Abdullah II of Jordan and the 2016 U.S.-ASEAN Leaders Summit featuring Obama and leaders from 10 nations. Countless retreats featuring Supreme Court justices, congressional leaders, filmmakers, musicians, artists and experts in various industries have also taken place there.
USC has maintained a relationship with Sunnylands through Cowan, Annenberg, the School of Cinematic Arts and other USC-Sunnylands hybrid employees such as Geoffrey Baum, who served as managing director of the USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy for many years and currently serves as the chief communications and marketing officer at Sunnylands. Lane said he will maintain that institutional relationship.
“We will continue to collaborate with the various Annenberg institutions, as they make a natural fit,” Lane said. “It’s less that anything formal is necessary, but more that there’s already a rhythm of collaboration with USC that has certainly served Sunnylands well and, I assume, has served USC well.”
Lane said he wants to continue Sunnylands’ reputation as a place to bring people together, particularly congressional leaders.
“It’s no surprise there hasn’t been a great congressional convening over the last few years, because that piece of our government especially has been so broken in terms of bipartisan cooperation,” Lane said. “These may be famous last words, but I at least intend to try to do something there. We can start with some initiatives where there’s bipartisan support and try to model what cooperation looks like.”
As ambassador, Lane led strategy-setting and governance of six multilateral agencies focused on food security, agricultural development, poverty alleviation, development finance and rule of law promotion. He advocated for inclusion of a “justice and accountable governance” provision in the UN’s recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals aimed at fighting poverty, inequality and climate change through 2030. Before being appointed ambassador, Lane served in the White House as assistant to the president and counselor to the chief of staff. Before that, he was president and CEO of the ONE Campaign, the non-partisan organization co-founded by singer Bono to fight extreme poverty and preventable diseases.
“David Lane was an exceptional ambassador to the UN Agencies in Rome,” said José Graziano da Silva, director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, in a statement. “His optimism regarding our ability to reach common objectives on eradicating hunger, reducing poverty and sustainably managing our planet’s resources was a compelling influence among member countries. This helped greatly in building consensus and confronting our shared challenges.”
From 2001 to 2007, Lane led public policy and advocacy efforts at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. During the Clinton administration, he served as chief of staff to the Secretary of Commerce and executive director of the National Economic Council.
“David is a bridge builder,” Melinda Gates said in a statement. “He brings people together to find policy solutions to some of the world’s biggest challenges. He knows the policy backwards and forwards, but he’s also creative about getting things done.”
