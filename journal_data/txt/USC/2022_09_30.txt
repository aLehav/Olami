I don’t like sports. My apologies to my sports bro friends who might be reading this article, but I really don’t — maybe it’s my lack of knowledge or my lack of care, but I don’t really enjoy watching people sweat as they run up and down courts or fields, and I’ve never understood the rules of most popular sports on TV. 
But, as is obviously a trend with many things in my life, when the K-pop world began to intersect with that of the sports industry, I suddenly became intrigued. 
While I didn’t know beforehand that the Golden State Warriors would be in Japan this week to play two preseason games against the Washington Wizards, I definitely did on Monday — when BTS member Suga posted a photo posing with a custom Warriors jersey on Twitter that has since gained over 400,000 retweets and 1.4 million likes. 
On Thursday, Stephen Curry posted photos from their meeting at the Warriors’ practice — photos I’ve seen all over my own Twitter feed and that more than one of my sports fanatic friends sent to me. 
Apparently — shocker! — K-pop idols like sports. With K-pop fans stereotypically being very invested in the hobbies and interests of their idols, whether it’s their favorite sports, their music recommendations or their pets, the virality of K-pop idols’ interactions with the sports world really isn’t something that shocking. 
It seems like almost every time an idol is spotted at a sports game (or even just mentions something sports-related), tweets and photos of the idols watching and cheering circulate quickly among their fans. In fact, I still remember seeing BTS for the first time at the (now) Crypto.com Arena in 2018, and Suga joking in his ending ment that Kobe Bryant was in attendance at the concert. Suga was also spotted at a Los Angeles Dodgers game in 2019, and NCT’s Taeyong, Mark and Johnny led a t-shirt toss at an L.A. Clippers game later that year. NCT’s Chenle and Mark were even spotted in the Warriors’ “Dub Hub,” a virtual game viewing experience that live streamed videos of viewers onto Chase Center’s video screens. 
It’s not uncommon for K-pop idols to appear publicly at sports games — NCT 127 and ENHYPEN both threw first pitches at L.A. Dodgers games in 2019 and 2022, respectively, and P1Harmony’s Keeho sang the Korean national anthem at a Major League Soccer match between LAFC and the Seattle Sounders last year. 
Perhaps the most shocking example of the intersection of the K-pop and sports worlds is that of GOT7’s BamBam and Warriors player Andrew Wiggins. Last January, BamBam, who also serves as a global ambassador of the Warriors, tweeted a voting endorsement for Wiggins to be selected as a starter in the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. The tweet, which garnered over 40,000 retweets and almost 71,000 likes, caused a severe spike in votes that resulted in Wiggins’ unexpected selection. 
It’s interesting to note the level of engagement that these interactions receive from both K-pop and sports fans alike. While I have little to no interest in sports, I always get a weird boost of serotonin whenever I see pictures or videos of my favorite idols interacting with athletes. Perhaps it’s because I get really happy seeing my idols enjoying their hobbies and getting to meet people they admire and follow personally, but it could also be 
because I love the exposure these meetings bring to an extremely different demographic of people. 
Although, let’s be honest — K-pop fans and sports fans really aren’t that different, with both demographics competing for close seats at events, buying their favorite artists’ or teams’ merchandise and forming communities with other fans. While unexpected, the connection between K-pop and sports is one that I think actually makes a lot of sense. 
In fact, it’s not that this exposure isn’t reciprocated — K-pop fans around the world are learning about and beginning to care about the athletes and teams that their favorite idols like, for no reason other than that their idol is a fan too. 
So, while I wouldn’t call myself a sports fan just yet, maybe I’m considering learning a little bit more about it. And to all my sports bros reading this, maybe it’s time for you to learn the names of the members of BTS too.

When RISE Consulting president Kevin Arackaparambil first started at USC, he aspired to be a part of the University’s infamously selective consulting clubs. Unfortunately, he didn’t get into a single one. 
“I wanted to join a consulting club because there are a lot of cool professional experiences that people talk about,” said Arackaparambil, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration. “But then, it’s so hard to get into them. And then, especially when I didn’t get into any of them, I was like, ‘Wow, I’m paying so much money in tuition, and here I am unable to participate in the experiences that would help me advance my academic and professional career.’ I think it is a problem here at USC.” 
Designed for students who are interested in consulting to gain hands-on experience in the field while working with third-party clients, consulting clubs also offer a chance to go through the casing interview process: a process where the interviewee must solve a business scenario in a time-pressured environment. The Marshall School of Business’ recognized student consulting clubs include 180 Degrees Consulting, Association of Innovative Marketing Consulting, Consulting Club, International Consulting Club at USC, Los Angeles Community Impact, RISE consulting and TAMID at USC.
The clubs also boast low acceptance rates: Out of an application pool of approximately 160 students, RISE accepted between 10 and 15 applicants to join in Fall 2022 — somewhere between six and nine percent.
The application process for many consulting clubs includes a written application and individual or group interviews, including behavioral, market sizing and/or case questions, matching the typical application process for consulting jobs outside of college. 
180 Degrees Consulting is the largest student organization in the world that does nonprofit consulting, with about 150 chapters around the world. The club’s USC chapter works directly with nonprofits in the Los Angeles area to help them in whatever area they need, 180 Degrees Consulting president Shruti Shakthivel said. 
“The reason why we have a robust recruitment cycle is because our projects are really involved,” said Shakthivel, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “If we’re going to be working with nonprofits and ask them for their time, we want to make sure that whatever we give them is the highest quality and the same thing for all the consulting firms. If companies are paying them millions of dollars to solve a problem, they need to be staffing the smartest minds that they can find.” 
Consulting clubs typically take on about two to 15 new members each semester to maintain their size of about 30 to 60 people in the club as a whole.  
“We don’t want to create an atmosphere of competitiveness,” Shakthivel said. “Within our organization, it’s very clear that no one’s ever competing with each other and throughout recruitment. We want to keep it that way. It’s honestly just about what we’re able to sustain.”
The competition to get into the clubs could also be due to the symptoms of post-coronavirus pandemic college life, Shakthivel said, as students are now searching increasingly for a community and a sense of belonging on campus. 
“I think there is an increasing sense of competition for all organizations,” Shakthivel said. “I’ve seen that trend, honestly, across all organizations that I’ve been applying to and been in just because more people want to get involved.”
The competition in getting into consulting clubs on campus reflects the difficulty of getting into the industry. According to online interview preparation resource CaseCoach, one of the top consulting firms, McKinsey, gets more than a million applications every year, but the firm hires less than 1% of them.
“When I talk to people who are in consulting who have these full-time jobs, it is this game,” Shakthivel said. “You need to network and you need to know the questions to ask and you need to know the right people, but that’s consistent across all industries. It’s not specific to consulting. I think consulting just gets a lot of the heat because it’s such a desirable job.”
Despite the competition needed to get into these clubs, they also provide many resources and hands-on experience for their members. The Marshall Consulting and Strategy Club offers a wide range of resources: networking events, information sessions, access to different case books and help from alumni, said Parvathi Bindhu, a second year master’s student studying business administration and a member of the Marshall Consulting and Strategy Club.
“I don’t think I would have been able to do half as good as I am doing right now if not for the members and mentors of the club and all the resources that they could have made available,” Bindhu said. “I was really not that great when I started off last year during my first year but I am a lot more comfortable now.” 
Despite its competitiveness, the application process — as well as involvement in the clubs themselves —  foster skill growth among students as they prepare for the workforce, Shakthivel said. 
“I’ve personally applied to all of the consulting clubs,” Arackaparambil said. “The process was very scary, but kind of [a learning process]. After my first case, which I just absolutely failed, I saw what they were looking for, and it helped me practice, improve and get better.”

Ah, midterm season — a period that seems to expand beyond the confines of the middle of the term into a never-ending work session from week four until right before finals. As more and more assignments and tests pile up, it’s easy to burn yourself out. It’s important to take some time for yourself, and maybe have a few laughs along the way. Whether you love sitcoms or talk shows or suffer through “Saturday Night Live” every week like me, the classic stand-up special can provide some comfort to everyone. 
Stand-up has produced some of the greatest comics and jokes ever. However, when it’s bad, it’s really bad. This list is meant to help you skip over those monstrous waste-of-an-hour specials and discover some specials filled with nonstop laughs. So, without further ado, here are the most delectable, scrumptious stand-up specials you will ever have the chance to feast on. 
Julio Torres’ “My Favorite Shapes” — HBO Max
Julio Torres is an absolute icon. Although you may not have heard his name before, you probably know some of his work. He is the brains behind Ryan Gosling’s’ “Papyrus” sketch on “Saturday Night Live” — a cult classic featuring an extremely melodramatic performance about the “Avatar” poster. 
Torres’ ability to turn the mundane into a whimsical, engaging fantasy is what makes “My Favorite Shapes” such a special watch. The special is literally about his favorite shapes. However, what Torres considers a shape is certainly eccentric, with shapes including the curtain between first class and economy and a cactus voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda.
The entire special is absurd, and may often feel like a fever dream, but through this special, Torres invites you to escape your world, and just briefly, step into his fantastical visions. 
James Acaster’s “James Acaster: Repertoire” — Netflix
As one of the wittiest stand-ups to ever join the scene, Acaster simply never misses. One of the greatest contestants to ever grace the “Taskmaster” screen (a recommendation for another day), nothing but greatness could be expected from him. 
“Repertoire” is a stand-up series: four separate shows that are tightly interwoven — leading to a showstopping finale. The shows, “Recognize,” “Represent,” “Reset” and “Recap” all showcase Acaster playing different characters including an undercover cop and a man about to enter witness protection. Acaster mixes absurdity and cleverness flawlessly in these absolutely hysterical episodes.
If you’ve never watched stand-up comedy before, or even if you’ve just never liked it, this is the special that will change your mind. Although, everything you watch after it will probably pale in comparison to Acaster’s one-of-a-kind wit.
Catherine Cohen’s “The Twist?… She’s Gorgeous” — Netflix
Catherine Cohen just gets it. She says it best herself in an interview with Vogue. It’s comedy for “girl’s girls… girls of any gender.” She’s loud, glittery and says exactly what she is thinking — even if that includes her inappropriate thoughts during her 10 a.m. Chipotle trips. 
Often labeled as “annoying,” Cohen owns the label and even plays into it. A song featured in her special, “Look at Me,” is the anthem for everyone that is simultaneously debilitatingly insecure and extremely egotistical.
A small caveat to this recommendation: after watching the special, you may find yourself picking up some of Cohen’s distinct (albeit fabulous) mannerisms. 
Rose Matafeo’s “Horndog” — HBO Max
Just like Catherine Cohen, Rose Matafeo is deeply relatable. As a person also traumatized by the discovery that flat feet weren’t the norm, Matafeo’s ability to basically tell my life story was almost scary. Still, her absolute genius writing makes up for it. 
Another classic “Taskmaster” contestant, Matafeo is the type of comic you want to be best friends with while simultaneously being slightly intimidated by her intelligence and confidence. In her special, she talks about her love life and being a late bloomer, speaking as if the viewer has been friends with her for years. If there’s a day where you’re feeling especially down, “Horndog” will be there to give you the hug you so desperately need. 
Jerrod Carmichael’s “Rothaniel”  — HBO Max
I’ve written about “Rothaniel” before, but I couldn’t write this list and not include it. “Rothaniel” will be one of the most defining stand-up specials of this decade. Carmichael transforms the usual stand-up special — a person on a stage with a mic stand — into an intimate performance art piece. The camera zooms in close to Carmichael’s face, almost uncomfortably so, as he divulges into the deepest aspects of his being. 
While the special addresses serious themes such as homophobia and family trauma, humor is woven into every bit. Balancing dark themes and comedy is not an easy task, but Carmichael is an expert of the craft. He turns his special into a performance art piece. “Rothaniel” proves that the future of comedy is Carmichael. 
Daniel Sloss’ “Daniel Sloss: Dark” – Netflix
Okay, here’s one for all of you “edgy” humor folks. As the name suggests, Daniel Sloss’ work is not afraid to get dark. In this jam-packed hour, Sloss speaks on religion and disabilities — both times toeing the line between jokes and obscenities. Just like Carmichael, Sloss is an expert in the balance between intense social commentary and humor. 
“Dark” is part of a two-part special entitled “Daniel Sloss: Live Shows.” While the second hour, “Jigsaw” is certainly worth a watch, “Dark” is truly a special that draws you in. By the end of the whirlwind hour, you will be hurt — both from laughing too hard and from Sloss’ stinging observations.

USC’s second annual Green Week is just around the corner, and the Office of Sustainability is looking to expand on last year’s sustainability efforts and awareness through seminars, on-campus activities, student organization initiatives and the unveiling of new sustainability projects. 
This year’s carousel of activities will kick off with the Arizona State-USC zero waste football game this coming Saturday. Both students and general attendees can expect extra pre-game festivities in and around the Coliseum, large commemorative banners strewn around campus celebrating the University’s sustainability achievements and goals and a halftime video address from University President Carol Folt.  
Ellen Dux, associate director of the Office of Sustainability, said the office is proud of the work surrounding the zero waste game and other major events held at the Coliseum.
“Football games at the Coliseum, and really at this point, any events over 10,000 attendees, are run as zero waste events,” Dux said. “[This] means we’re routinely diverting above 90% of waste from landfill to either compost or recycling.”
Mick Dalrymple, USC’s chief sustainability officer said he’s excited about the progress his team has made.
“I’m excited that Green Week is coming up again and how people are rallying around, doing and bringing stuff to the table,” Dalrymple said. “It really shows how sustainability is getting woven into all the different corners of campus.”
Dalrymple made several new announcements in a communitywide email Thursday afternoon, including a new postdoctoral fellowship program. The new venture hopes to “accelerate sustainability research, train future leaders and support discovery and implementation of innovative solutions to sustainability problems.”.
The office also announced the USC sustainability hub, which provides community members with live, sustainability-related data regarding energy usage, building expenditures, campus greenery and transportation. The site also provides information on sustainable resources around campus, including water bottle refill stations, LEED-powered buildings and multi-stream waste bins. 
USC Research has moved into stage three of the Urban Trees initiative. A joint partnership between the City of Los Angeles and USC, the program aims to guide the growth of greenery throughout South L.A. Researchers have now begun to identify places in both East and South L.A. where trees can both provide cooling and improve air quality and health. 
A variety of on-campus clubs will also host events throughout the week. The Arts and Climate Collective will host “Regenerate,” an art festival intended to inspire and support climate justice within the local community at the USC Fisher Museum on Oct. 3 in collaboration with Visions and Voices and the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab. The event will showcase a myriad of ACC student projects, screen climate justice films and host a sustainable art workshop. Environmental justice activist and Anagnos Culture of Liberation award winner Nalleli Cobo, Director of Community Engagement at the USC Keck School of Medicine Jill Johnston and USC Professor of design China Adams are slated to speak at the event. 
While the ACC is yet to finalize which projects it will have on display, the focus will be multidisciplinary.
“We hope to show films, we hope to show visual art, we hope to show fashion,” said Natasha Nutkiewicz, an ACC grantee, intern and senior majoring in theater.  
Founded under the President’s Working Group on Sustainability, the ACC hopes to leverage University resources through funded student projects to raise awareness of the climate crisis. 
“We want to empower students to use all their tools and all their unique visions to fight this climate emergency,” Nutkiewicz said. 
Both the USC Peace Garden and USC Garden Club will host open gardening hours for students interested in getting their hands dirty. The Peace Garden will focus on adding native greenery to their plot outside the Shrine on Wednesday, while the gardening club will resume standard operations during their Friday timeslot. 
USC’s Students for Environmental Action, a student-led organization advocating for environmental sustainability and advocacy, plans to host several events throughout the week in a similar fashion to last year, including a forest clean-up and local tree planting exercise. 
“We prioritize taking action by not only incentivizing individual action but also coordinating giant group efforts,” said Cory DeWitt, a sophomore studying computer science and the Environmental Student Assembly’s co-president. 
While DeWitt is looking forward to the plethora of events, it’s the conversations they inspire that make the effort worthwhile. 
“As long as you’re talking about these issues, that’s the most important thing,” DeWitt said. 
Clover, another student organization aimed at promoting veganism, environmentalism and “reducetarianism,” will hold its annual vegan mac and cheese bake-off to further encourage vegan exploration.
“We talk a little bit about sustainability relating to veganism and stuff like that, but in a fun way that’s a little bit more approachable,” said Dominic Borrelli, co-president of Clover. “We might sneak a couple of other events in there as well.”
While Borrelli said he is content with USC’s immediate efforts toward going green, he also called for more accountability from the USC Board of Trustees.
“Our Board of Trustees primarily works in industries that are at odds with environmental progress,” Borelli said. “Most of them work for major corporations, even some of them are oil and gas companies … I think we need to overhaul our Board of Trustees.”

USC announced the new Bachelor of Fine Arts in game art in the School of Cinematic Arts and the technical game art minor in the Viterbi School of Engineering for the 2022-23 school year.
The game art major requires 52 units of cross-disciplinary courses that involve using visual expression and technical animation with a collaborative cohort. Required courses cover topics ranging from 3D and character modeling to workshops on game design and digital media. Students must also enroll in the advanced games project course to fulfill a year-long capstone project that involves working with a 10-person team to pitch and create a game.
Within the major, students can declare a concentration in character animation, environmental design, visual effects, 3D pipelines or interactive animation.
Professors from SCA and Viterbi joined forces to develop and finalize the game art curriculum in Fall 2020. The schools allowed students to enter the major as internal transfers beginning in Spring 2021.
“The three pillars are often thought of as design, code and art,” said School of Cinematic Arts Academic Program Manager Sam Roberts. “We were teaching at an excellent level the first two and we didn’t have a degree program for the third … We made the decision because there’s a lot of parts of making art for games [and] animators are potentially one of the most needed.”
Students enrolled in the majors in SCA’s Interactive Media & Games Division share a large number of classes during their freshman year, which helps to replicate the collaborative nature of game development in the industry. Roberts said that game development jobs function “between spaces,” making it integral that students have an introductory education across several disciplines within gaming.
Twenty freshmen are currently enrolled in the major alongside a dozen upperclassmen that joined as internal transfers. Roberts said he seeks to expand the class size and add more electives and specialties once the major increases in demand. As of now, the professors have devised a number of classes within the animation department specific to real-time animation used in game art.
“There’s a limited number of programs [elsewhere] that teach animation and digital assets from an explicitly real-time interactive point of view,” Roberts said. “Students who’ve gone through our program come out having worked in these pipelines, with running games in their portfolio, where they made digital assets in the fashion that the games industry requires.”
The professors simultaneously worked to redesign pre-existing courses to better fit the game art narrative. One of these courses — ITP 215: Introduction to 3D Modeling, Animation, and Visual Effects — teaches students the technical underpinnings and pipelines that go into games.
Viterbi engineering and computer science games professor Scott Easley modified the course to focus on a hands-on approach to teach students basic Maya, a 3D modeling, texturing, rendering and rigging software that has a stronghold in the game industry.
“Everything students work on from day one contributes to their final,” he said. “They build an object, they learned modeling, we’re in the throes of building a car, we then texture the car to look realistic. We then make the wheels move. We then put it on the desk. Everyone makes a prop in their dorm, and then we all code that from that big mound of information and everyone makes a little table full of objects. The final is to film that car winding its way through the objects according to a storyboard.” 
Willem Lent, a freshman majoring in game art, chose USC because of its unique game art program and was impressed with the faculty’s role as both professors and developers working in the gaming industry. He said ITP 215 is his favorite class this semester.
“Professor Easley is very personable,” he said. “He’s very understanding. He’s very fun. The class is very productive, but it doesn’t really feel like I’m just sitting in there and taking notes or learning, it’s very hands-on. I have no prior experience with 3D modeling before, but I’ve already come so far with the software in the few weeks that we’ve been working.”
ITP 215 fulfills the requirements for both the game art major and technical game art minor. Easley, along with faculty in SCA and Viterbi who have worked to implement these new degree pathways, aspires to help existing artists adapt to the world of 3D modeling.   
“My hope is that [my class] gives them a taste of taking their existing skill set and having them comfortably go into the world of 3D with it,” Easley said. “If I can bring those walls down and say, ‘it’s actually no less complex than things you’ve already mastered,’ then a whole new generation of digital artists can become 3D modelers, can become environment modelers, can do whatever they want.”

“Watched by all, seen by none” is the tagline for director Andrew Dominik’s “Blonde,” Netflix’s new NC-17-rated, polarizing portrait of Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe. The phrase is undeniably ironic, not because it is untrue, but because, over the course of the film’s nearly three-hour runtime, Dominik turns his central subject into a spectacle — a sad, sparkling vestige of a woman whose life is painted in brushstrokes of anguish. Although it claims to be a sincere portrait of Monroe’s life, the film invites the audience to bear witness to her misery, even indulge in it, making for a hellish retelling of the Marilyn myth.
“Blonde,” based on Joyce Carol Oates’ novel of the same name, is essentially a fictionalized ode to the idea of Marilyn Monroe: her life, her lovers and her low points — of which there are several. Ana de Armas stars as Monroe in a captivating performance that is perhaps the sole redeeming quality of “Blonde,” a representation she injects with so much emotion that, if not for the disturbing and distasteful nature of the film, would be impossible to look away from. If de Armas was compensated per tear, she would be one of the highest-paid actresses of 2022. 
De Armas’ embodiment of Monroe is so believable that one occasionally feels as though Monroe herself has been resurrected, although, as she breathily insists in one scene, “Marilyn Monroe only exists on the screen.” The film acknowledges that the public has long possessed a fascination with fantasy, depicting the tempestuous media frenzy Monroe was at the center of. Throngs of reporters and raucous fans attempt to see her, to touch her, but never to know her. 
That’s not to suggest that the filmmakers had malicious intent. De Armas confessed that she and the “Blonde” crew visited Monroe’s burial site in Westwood to ask permission to tell her story. 
“Everyone felt a huge responsibility, and we were very aware of the side of the story we were going to tell — the story of Norma Jeane, the person behind this character, Marilyn Monroe. Who was she really?” she said. 
What de Armas and the crew really should have asked for, though, was Monroe’s forgiveness. 
Watching “Blonde” will make you want to take a long shower — probably the only cure for its lingering stench. It spares no uncomfortable detail when it comes to showcasing the ways in which Monroe was mistreated and routinely exploited by the men in her life. From being raped by a studio head referred to only as “Mr. Z,” to being physically abused by her partner Joe DiMaggio and thought of as nothing more than a booty-call by John F. Kennedy, Monroe is reduced to a mere object. You can now add Dominik to the list of men who have treated her as such.
Dominik proves to be a rather self-indulgent director by capitalizing on the deep-rooted romanticization that has become routine when recounting Monroe’s life story. The film focuses heavily on Monroe’s body, engaging in blatant objectification  — de Armas is topless for a solid chunk of it — rather than making the effort to venture inside its central character’s mind. In doing so, “Blonde” and its creator engage in the same patterns of behavior that they claim to condemn. 
It is for this reason that “Blonde” plays out more like a horror film than a fictionalized biopic, or, rather, a speculative dive into Monroe’s soul. It is about the ghosts of a woman’s past haunting her adult life, although in this case, the phantoms have persisted well past her death. 
Ultimately, “Blonde” doesn’t celebrate Monroe’s legacy; if anything, it actively dishonors it. The result is an extended cinematic nightmare that perpetuates a harmful fantasy about a very real woman, a woman whose legacy extends far beyond the shade of her hair.

If you were to stand next to sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry, it would be almost impossible to ignore the physical traits he possesses. Gentry stands at 6-foot-6 and weighs 200 pounds, but what may be most intriguing about his physique is his 7-foot-1 wingspan.
Gentry cites eighth grade as the year he had a growth spurt, sprouting from 5-foot-11 to around 6-foot-3. 
“I started playing linebacker because of my confidence in myself,” Gentry said. “I’m confident in how I play and I’m not really letting outside noise affect me.”
That young, growing Gentry took full advantage of his rare combination of height and length to excel in athletics, playing football and basketball at Saints Neumann Goretti High School in Philadelphia. Gentry loved both sports, but decided that committing to football full time would give him the best opportunity to play at the collegiate level.
“My coach explained scholarships to me,” Gentry said. “It’s harder to get scholarships in basketball and I didn’t have as many scholarships for basketball as I did for football.”
A linebacker and defensive end, Gentry had a breakout season his junior year, totaling 15 sacks, 2 interceptions and 3 fumble recoveries on defense, along with 2 touchdown catches at tight end.
In July 2020, Gentry announced his commitment to Arizona State University.  Hailing from Philadelphia, Gentry knew receiving an offer from a Pac-12 school was something he could not pass up.
“Not many people from the east coast get a Pac-12 type of offer,” Gentry said. “It was really important to me to have confidence in myself to know that I’m an impact player.”
Gentry had 45 tackles, 5 tackles for loss, one sack and two pass deflections in his 12 games played as a freshman for the Sun Devils. After one season with ASU, Gentry sought a fresh start and transferred to USC this fall of 2022, wanting to be a part of the storied USC football tradition.
“I wanted to go somewhere to start history and somewhere where there was already history,” Gentry said. “I wanted to start somewhere new and start somewhere different.”
Throughout his career so far, Gentry has developed the mentality of playing with something to prove every time he steps onto the field.
“I’m just trying to get better every day,” Gentry said. “I don’t want to feel like I’m proven or respected ,and I don’t want to feel like the team or defense is respected. I’m really just trying to get the team to the best that it can be.”
Gentry has already proven himself to be one of the most impactful members of USC’s defense. He recorded 7 tackles in his debut game against Rice, and increased that total to 10 against Stanford. Facing Fresno State and Oregon State, Gentry had 15 combined tackles and was able to make his mark most evident in clutch fashion during USC’s thrilling win in Corvallis last Saturday.
Gentry nabbed his first interception of the season in the second quarter, picking off Oregon State quarterback Chase Nolan at the 30-yard line to preserve a 7-0 Trojan lead. On OSU’s final drive, Gentry was also able to deflect a pass, one which was ultimately intercepted by defensive back Max Williams to seal the victory for USC. Whenever Trojan players and coaches are asked about Gentry, they remark his distinct effect on the game — one which was obvious on Saturday against the Beavers.
“It’s definitely unique, I’ve never played next to somebody with that kind of length,” linebacker Shane Lee said about Gentry’s abilities. “You can’t throw a short ball when Eric’s there, you’ve just got to throw it up.”
Over his short time at USC so far, Gentry’s teammates and coaches have become impressed with him not just as a football player, but as a leader on the defense. When it comes to press conferences, Gentry is usually soft-spoken, saying no more than he needs. However, when on the field with his teammates, Gentry is among the most vocal players on the team.
“Eric brings a lot of energy,” Lee said. “He’s always yelling, screaming and trying to get guys up. He’s always trying to spread positive energy and attitude throughout the defense and throughout the team. Since he’s gotten here, he’s been trying to bring guys together and help us propel this thing forward.”
Gentry’s coaches and teammates have seen him improve more and more each week since he began playing at USC.
“He’s making more routine plays,” Head Coach Lincoln Riley said. “He was making the splash plays when you looked at his film last year and he was making splash plays early on in camp. You can see how his length affects the game and the physicality he plays with. Now he’s doing it with less mistakes and making solid plays.”
One coach that has gotten to watch Gentry as close as anyone this season is defensive coordinator Alex Grinch. When looking at Gentry’s film, it is difficult not to think about the kind of potential he has going forward.
“On film, he stood out as a run and hit type of guy,” Grinch said. “You see the good stuff and I think with all guys there’s question marks, but by and large he’s answered them. Just wait until he gets good.”
USC was able to beat Oregon State by finding a way to escape a low scoring and scrappy defensive battle. The Trojans’ offense has seen firsthand how the defense, and Gentry in particular, is improving as the season goes on.
“You just see him maturing week by week,” redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington said. “He’s grown so much from when he first got here compared to now and he’s going to grow much more.”
Gentry is very aggressive on the football field, stating that he never liked offense and always wanted to play defense because of the physicality and challenge it presents. When asked what players he looked up to, he picks guys like Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons and Arizona Cardinals linebacker Isaiah Simmons.
Parsons has been a player to whom Gentry got to pay particular attention, as both are originally from Pennsylvania — they’ve even played on the same 7-on-7 team. 
Despite sharing similarities with some of the best NFL athletes, Gentry has a humble mindset: When it comes time to play, he believes, those who focus the most on hard work will become the game’s best players.
“I’m not really worried about any intangibles,” Gentry said. “That’s just how I am; I have the heart.”
Gentry transferred to USC with a goal of making history. Based on how promising he has looked so far, he is well on his way to doing just that for the Trojans.

The Los Angeles Lakers went down in flames to end the 2021-22 season, waving the white flag en route to an uninspiring 33-49 record. After a drama-filled season that rivaled “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” fans of the Purple and Gold hoped — and deserved — to see some semblance of a winning product with training camp around the corner. 
However, an offseason ripe with head-scratching moves from the front office made it abundantly clear that the team was more committed to being a reality show than raising banners in Crypto.com Arena. 
So, ladies and gentlemen, grab your popcorn, because season two of ‘Keeping Up with the Lakers’ is just weeks away. 
At the focal point is everyone’s favorite star, Russell Westbrook — the Kim Kardashian of the show, if you will. All signs pointed to a nasty yet very necessary breakup between the two parties at the season’s end, sealed and stamped by his standoffish exit interview. 
When asked about whether LeBron James and Anthony Davis let him be himself on the floor, Westbrook scoffed, claiming, “That wasn’t true. Let’s be honest … I was never given a fair chance just to be who I needed to be to help this team.”
With an inevitable breakup on the horizon, general manager Rob Pelinka shopped Westbrook and his 47 million dollar expiring contract through the offseason. A week could barely go by without a new trade rumor popping up. Gordon Hayward? Kyrie Irving? Buddy Hield? Myles Turner? Bojan Bogdanovic? Westbrook probably had his bags packed, heavily anticipating his new destination.
Every general manager was fully aware of the tire fire that had taken place within the Lakers organization during the season. With apparent knowledge that the Lakers had backed themselves into a corner, the leverage play was to juice the organization of all their assets, namely their 2027 and 2029 first-round draft picks.
With offers on the table and the chance to take accountability for perhaps the worst trade in Lakers history, the front office opted to deflect blame to LeBron’s sports agency and stand pat. While choosing to run it back with a formula already proven to fail, Pelinka prioritized two future first-round picks, who are probably in their early teenage years right now, over a generational talent in LeBron James going into his 20th season.
Currently a few days into training camp, it is clear that Westbrook will be a Laker this season. So how can the organization maximize the 33-year-old’s skill set while ensuring the former All-Star isn’t a detriment to their success?
For starters, it’s important to create an environment where Westbrook is comfortable, surrounded by teammates he is willing to fight for. So Pelinka scoured the market, trading 21-year-old Talen Horton-Tucker, who LeBron previously called “HIM,” for … Patrick Beverly? *checks notes* That can’t be right!
Beverly and Westbrook have notoriously had beef since the 2013 season, when Westbrook suffered a season-ending knee injury at the hands of Beverly in the first round of the playoffs. 
Since the play, which Westbrook deemed “dirty,” the pair has repeatedly bickered during their on-court matchups over the past nine years while taking shots at each other during press conferences. This grudge eventually birthed one of the most iconic quotes and memes of all time. After a regular season matchup between the two, Westbrook told the media, “Pat Bev trick y’all, man, like he playing defense. He don’t guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing.”
Westbrook better hope Beverly isn’t tricking anybody, as the two will don the Purple and Gold and most likely see minutes on the floor together. Whether or not this pairing translates to wins, one thing is certain: This makes for some fantastic theater.
But Beverly is just one player on a roster of 15 guys. In a wing-driven league, surrounding Westbrook with lengthy wings that can play defense and shoot the long ball could be a recipe for success. So, Pelinka combed through the free agent market and picked up … two non-shooting wings? 
Troy Brown Jr. and Juan Toscano-Anderson, albeit lengthy, 6-foot-6 forwards, are neither proven shooters nor primary defenders. The Lakers front office also opted to bring back Dennis Schroder after he failed to produce in the first round of the 2021 playoffs during his first go-round with the Lakers, his fit with Westbrook being clunky at best. 
With Westbrook, Beverly, Schroder, the returning Austin Reaves, newly signed Lonnie Walker IV and a finally healthy Kendrick Nunn, this crowded backcourt is just one of the many ingredients that may lead the Lakers down a stairway to turmoil. 
Almost like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, the Lakers will run back the Westbrook experiment once again. But, in the wise words of Kris Jenner, “When you feel like something is really wrong, it’s usually wrong.”

No. 5 USC finished fourth at the MPSF Invitational in Stanford, Calif. last weekend, taking wins over No. 17 Fordham and No. 7 UC Davis but losing to crosstown rival No. 2 (T) UCLA and No. 2 (T) Cal. 
In their two losses of the tournament, the Trojans ended only one goal short of their opponent in both games. USC lost to UCLA 13-12 and to Cal 11-10. 
After playing neck-and-neck for their entire semifinal game, USC couldn’t catch up to the Bruins and conceded their first weekend loss. The Bruins finished second overall in the tournament, losing only to Stanford in the finals. This is USC’s second loss to UCLA this season, and they still have at least one more matchup against the Bruins to go in the regular conference season. 
USC’s matchup for third place pitted them against Cal, their first matchup of the season thus far. Despite being shutout in two out of four quarters against the Bears, the Trojans fought their way back from a three-point deficit to take the lead entering the fourth quarter. However, that lead quickly drowned after two successful 6-on-5 possessions by Cal, and the Bears took the third place slot in the tournament. 
“Our 6-on-5 conversion up to that point in the tournament was actually very good, but again in that last quarter if we had scored two goals and if we had stopped them, we would have won the game,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric. 
After this weekend’s competition, four specific Trojans have continued to show consistent and significant offensive achievements. Graduate student Massimo Di Maritre, who has earned MPSF Newcomer of the Week two out of the three weeks this season, leads the Trojans in individual points with 32 goals. Marcus Longton, senior driver, continues his streak of scoring in all 14 games this season, the only Trojan to do so this year. Redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt rose in the ranks of all-time scoring for USC men’s water polo, now holding No. 14 with 148 career goals in total. 
Freshman utility player Andrej Grgurevic has kicked off his first season on a high note, scoring 13 goals in 11 games. Last weekend alone Grgurevic scored five goals total; once per matchup against Fordham, UC Davis and UCLA and twice against Cal. 
“It’s definitely a step up when you play them, like mentally and physically,” Grgurevic said about playing top four teams like UCLA and Cal. 
As a freshman, Grgurevic is getting more action than most, and the competition is already heating up. 
“Both UCLA and Cal are both very quick, strong, fast teams and always keeping up with them is a challenge,” Grgurevic said. “As a team it was definitely [defense]… I feel we did a very good job throughout most of the game, it was just a few slip ups that we had that cost us, in the end, two big wins.”
Pintaric agreed and emphasized the work that he is putting into improving the Trojans’ defensive strategy. 
“We are allowing too many goals, and this is the work in progress that we have been facing and working on the most,” Pintaric said. 
In addition to cracking down on defense, Pintaric is looking forward to opening up his offense in games this weekend and in future conference matches. The Trojans have officially finished their tournament play for the season and are now moving into conference matchups until December. 
“We’re going to try to see if we can give more opportunities to other players,” Pintaric said. “We have 29 people on the roster, and we’ll see if there is a possibility and room to see other players in action,” Pintaric said. 
The Trojans will head to Santa Barbara, Calif. to face No. 8 UCSB on Friday, and then return home for a matchup against No. 9 UC Irvine on Sunday.

After a long defensive battle in Corvallis last Saturday, the Trojans were able to escape with a victory in nail-biting fashion, winning 17-14. USC will return to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday to face a struggling Arizona State University team.
Historically, USC has had success against Arizona State, boasting an all-time record of 24-14. But in their previous matchup, the Trojans lost 16-31 in Tempe. The game featured both junior quarterback Kedon Slovis and freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart, who combined for 220 yards, outdoing ASU’s 145 yards through the air. ASU’s run game was dominant, however, posting 282 yards on the ground along with 4 touchdowns. Both teams look very different now. 
In a perfect microcosm of the cyclic rotation of the transfer portal, redshirt junior quarterback Emory Jones, who transferred to ASU from Florida over the offseason, has taken the reins from junior quarterback Jayden Daniels, who now plays at LSU. 
In his first game of the season, Jones recorded 152 passing yards to go along with 48 yards and 2 touchdowns on the ground in a 37-point blowout of Northern Arizona University. 
Senior inside linebacker Shane Lee spoke on the Sun Devils quarterback’s rushing and passing ability in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
“I think he’s a great quarterback,” Lee said. “He’s a dual-threat guy, he does both well. So we definitely got to be on our Ps and Qs with him.”
Still, Jones has struggled against the ferocious pass rushes of Oklahoma State and Utah, who combined for 8 sacks, 2 interceptions and a completion rate below 60 percent between the two games. 
Heading into this week’s matchup, USC football Head Coach Lincoln Riley has confidence in his team’s run game, especially redshirt senior running back Travis Dye, who racked up 133 rushing yards and a touchdown against Oregon State. 
“[Dye] ran the ball well. He’s a very consistent competitor. You know what you’re going to get out of him every single day,” Riley said.
Dye is averaging 7.3 yards per carry and 10.6 yards per catch this season, showing his ability to contribute in multiple ways to USC’s high octane offense.
USC went up one spot in the national rankings after their win and currently sits at No. 6 in the country. One main factor to their success is not only their dynamic offense, but their stellar defensive play. On the season, USC has recorded 14 turnovers (11 interceptions and 3 fumbles), tied for first in the country. 
Lee attributes the defense’s success last Saturday to their mindset and responsiveness as a unit. 
“Every game we go out, every day we go out, we just try to put our best foot forward,” Lee said. “You try to put together complete practices, complete games. There’s always something to fix, to learn and to build off of. So we went out Saturday and we put our best foot forward and that result is what we got.”
Lee has been a stalwart of the USC defense this season, making a team high of 12 tackles against Oregon State. The Alabama transfer also has a sack and an interception on the season. 
While USC has seen improvements in their defensive front this year, their attention must be focused on ASU’s potentially lethal rushing attack, spearheaded by graduate running back Xazavian Vallady. In just four games, Valladay has put up nearly 400 yards and 4 touchdowns while averaging an exceptional 6.5 yards per carry. 
On the other side of the ball, the Trojans’ offense has been excellent thus far, posting an average of 42.3 points per game while averaging 7.1 yards per play. On the season, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams has been superb for the Trojans, averaging 263.5 yards per game with a perfect touchdown to interception ratio of nine to zero and a quarterback rating of 85.1, 10th in the country. In last week’s contest, however, Williams struggled to throw the ball against Oregon State’s strong defense, recording season lows in passing yards, touchdowns and completion percentage. Still, junior wide receiver Jordan Addison commended his leadership skills. 
“We need [Williams] on the sideline because no matter how the game is going, he’s going to make sure he’s level headed,” Addison said. “He’s ready to make that play at any given time, so having him on the sideline makes me want to go out there and make plays for him.” 
Riley shared a similar confidence in Williams’ ability as a quarterback. The coach and quarterback duo have been together since last season, completing the year at the University of Oklahoma with an overall record of 11-2. Riley does not consider last week’s performance an indication that Williams has lost his mechanics or his abilities as a quarterback. 
“He just had one of those nights where he wasn’t his best throwing-wise,” Riley said. “Saw things pretty well, had a couple of missed decisions but just missed a few throws. That’s going to happen. He’s as gifted as they come.”
Despite last week’s clutch win, Riley believes that the team needs to keep improving if they want to continue their ascent into college football relevance. 
“I think just refocusing us on operating the way we need to, coaching better, playing better,” Riley said. “I know it sounds kind of boring but it’s the truth. We need to coach better, we need to prep our guys better and we need to play better and play more precise.” 
Addison also felt that the team needed to stay focused in order to win their next matchup. 
“We’re going harder this week,” he said. “You know, coming off a great win against a great team, we have to make sure we’re preparing and not let this game coming up slip past us.”

The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education hosted a webinar Wednesday for universities, including USC, to share their approaches to measuring sustainability literacy and culture on their campuses.
More than 5,000 USC students, postdoctorates, faculty and staff participated in USC’s first annual sustainability survey in April. The survey was conducted to help the University inform sustainability engagement and education programming on campus and establish a baseline to measure the University’s progress toward its 2028 “Assignment: Earth” engagement goals, and its results were released in August. 
On average, respondents scored 61.5 percent for 10 general sustainability literacy questions and 52.3% on sustainability behavior and culture questions. The survey found more than 50% of respondents had a moderate or strong interest in learning more about sustainability practices and 47% of respondents were interested in getting involved with USC sustainability efforts or groups but had not yet done so. More than 50% of respondents indicated that they “usually” took actions to be more sustainable, such as reducing energy use and plastic waste and conserving water and paper.
The University first took AASHE’s Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System assessment — a self-reporting framework which helps universities assess their sustainability performance — in 2021, earning a silver rating. 577 universities, including all the UCs, have STARS ratings, which are based on performance credits earned in areas such as academics, engagement, operations, planning and administration and innovation and leadership. 
The webinar started with a brief overview of two STARS credits universities can pursue through sustainability literacy and culture assessments. STARS AC-6 requires a survey focused on knowledge of sustainability topics and challenges, while STARS EN-6 requires a survey on sustainability values, behaviors, beliefs and awareness of campus sustainability initiatives. Universities can administer both surveys to the entire campus community directly or by representative sample. 
USC kept in mind both meeting STARs requirements and measuring progress based on USC-specific goals when designing its sustainability survey.
“Definitely utilize your survey to fill in data gaps, and not just those AC-6 and EN-6 credits,” said USC Office of Sustainability data analyst Julie Hopper. “In addition to STARS, we implemented a survey to measure progress on our other sustainability goals at USC.”
Hopper described the process of developing, distributing and reporting USC’s sustainability literacy and culture survey along with representatives from three other institutions — Weber State University, Ramapo College and Williams College.
Highlights from Weber State’s survey included a need to work on inclusion of social justice in understandings of sustainability, a lower frequency of civic and political engagement among sustainability behaviors and higher concerns about the climate than national levels. Through Ramapo College’s survey, students and faculty recommended the university find ways to embed sustainability in the curriculum. Williams College’s survey is still collecting responses. 
From development to distribution, Hopper noted that the survey process took four months. The Office of Sustainability staff and interns reviewed sustainability surveys from more than 30 STARS-reporting universities to select common questions, which they modified for further clarity and relevance to USC. Staff also created additional questions to incorporate into the survey to best serve USC’s sustainability goals. 
The survey then went through rounds of feedback and revision. Select USC students, postdocs, staff and faculty reviewed the initial and final survey drafts. After incorporating their feedback, the Office of Sustainability team sent it for external review to sustainability staff at Arizona State University, California Institute of Technology and the University of California, Los Angeles. 
Once the team completed the survey and launched it in USC Qualtrics, they distributed it by emailing the entire university community, encouraging USC organizations to share it with their members and putting up signs around campus. Each participant also had a chance to win one of 20 $100 USC Bookstore gift cards as an incentive for completing the survey. 
After the survey closed at the end of April, the team cleaned, analyzed and visualized the data using tools such as Qualtrics, R and Excel. Hopper said that the university was transparent about the data and its limitations. 
The University also created tailored reports for specific populations like Keck Medicine, which Hopper recommended other universities do with their survey results. 
“That way you’re really honing in on the interest of those population groups at your university,” Hopper said. “Know your audience, when you’re doing those tailored reports, think about what’s important to them. What can they do with this information, and distribute specific results to those with power to implement change.”
The University’s survey, along with Weber State’s, assessed both sustainability literacy and culture. Weber State’s survey was based on a broad definition of sustainability. 
“We define sustainability holistically, very much environmental, social, and economic realms are all included,” said Alice Mulder, director of the Weber Sustainability Center.
Weber State’s survey questions included developed and tested knowledge and attitude questions such as Assessing Sustainability Knowledge and the Six-Americas Super Short Survey. 
Williams College also developed its sustainability survey following reviews of existing sustainability literacy and culture assessments, including Ohio State’s ASK, the SULI test, and surveys developed by Colby, Furman, Cornell, ASU and College of the Atlantic. 
Williams considered combining the sustainability literacy and culture assessment into a single survey to “reduce survey fatigue,” but ultimately decided to develop a separate sustainability culture survey.
“We decided after going into [the review and research] that we would separate the two surveys,” said Tanja Srebotnjak, director of Williams’ Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives. “We felt in particular that it would require more immersion into the sustainability culture, research and literature for us to fully capture the state of the art and transfer it meaningfully to the Williams College context.”
Williams shared the correct answers to its sustainability literacy questions after respondents submitted their form, which USC did not. Whether or not to share the correct answers afterward was a point of discussion for the attending universities.
“We’re biasing the results, potentially for the next year if we use the same survey questions, and we do want to be consistent with our survey questions so we can compare across time,” Hopper said. “[But] at the end of the day, is it bad that they know the answer because now they’re educated and so it’s okay if they score better, which I’m kind of leaning towards but very interested in this question. It’s such a great question.”

There are many words I use to describe myself: incredibly sexy, wildly smart, a comedic genius, always humble and of course, if you’ve read my column before, totally fabulous. But disabled? That’s a new addition. 
 The word “disability’’ was a word that gave me the same feeling as hearing the word “beefy” — uncomfortable. My discomfort isn’t because I believe the word “disabled” or “disability” is bad, derogatory or dirty — in fact, it’s quite the opposite. It’s a term and community for which I have deep respect, but a label I never dreamed I’d identify with myself. 
As I trudged through my traumatic multi-year healthcare journey, I used other words to describe my lived experience: uncool, not it, excruciating, fucked up and unfair. However, disability was not among them, and that was on purpose.
I was terrified of identifying as someone with a disability because I hadn’t been for 20 out of my 24 years of life. Who was I to take that term as my own? I also believed my poor health was temporary, and I’d bounce back like a Brentwood mom’s freshly done cheek implants. 
 First came the phase of skirting my way around using any term entirely. If I didn’t use them, none of this would be real. But my diagnoses are incurable, so there was no finish line; my new life required managing and living with them. 
 Then came the issue of convincing myself I wasn’t disabled enough to call myself disabled. I thought it was a term that applied only to visible disabilities. I got it in my head that in order for a disability to be real, you must see it, and by see it, I mean someone using a wheelchair, cane or other assistive device — and mine’s invisible.
It’s hard to admit, but it became clear that I’d fallen victim to internalized ableism. I realized I’d been socialized to question peoples’ disabilities if they didn’t fit a stereotypical archetype — even my own. Not to mention, it was hella confusing to be so sick yet stand in the mirror looking the same as I always had. I also have the privilege of passing as able-bodied, which amplified my discomfort with identifying as disabled.
Oh, and I tried the whole “differently abled” and “handicapable” thing, but both felt wrong. They felt like a new, trendy way to make able-bodied people more comfortable about their aesthetic anxiety over disabled people. In fact, in my first few columns of Chronically Catherine, I identified with the term “differently abled” because I thought that was the most politically correct term to use. That’s what all the able-bodied people in my life said so that’s what I should say too, right?
 Not exactly. I quickly started to pick up on the fact that “differently abled” was a confusing term. Differently abled suggested I lost certain abilities and gained other abilities. I lost the ability to be upright all day, but I wasn’t gifted with a new ability in its place, like the ability to fucking echolocate or grow gills. I have a dis-ability — I lost an ability. 
 Ultimately, two years into my diagnoses and health journey, I simply got tired of having to explain my health conditions and how they impact me. It took too much effort to paint a picture of all the challenges. I realized one word could convey it all immediately. 
 Once I started to identify as someone with a disability, a huge weight was lifted. Uttering that one word communicated the gravity, severity and immediacy of my lived experience. Do I get bitchy Karens coming up to me in the parking lot like, “Why are you parking in a handicap spot, you don’t look disabled”? Yes, I do, and truthfully, I live for those moments just so I can shatter the disabled stereotype and maybe expand the mind of a Karen. 
 Disability doesn’t have one face, shape or name. People with disabilities are unique, diverse and vastly different from each other. It’s an umbrella term, and fun fact: People with disabilities are the largest minority group in the world, and they are discriminated against, marginalized and face specific socioeconomic barriers simply because they have a disability. It’s also the only minority group anyone can join at any time. 
So, to those out there who think disability is a dirty word, it isn’t — it’s an accurate descriptor. And as far as being afraid to utter the word? Don’t be. The more we include it in our common vocabulary, the more normalized the term becomes.
 A final tip: Not everyone with a chronic health condition, wheelchair, cane or service dog may identify as disabled, so take your cues from them. Pay attention to how they refer to themselves, and if you aren’t sure, ask! Say, “How should I refer to your health condition?” or, “How do you prefer I refer to your lived experience?” For some, “differently abled” may be just what they need right now, or perhaps another term satisfies their identity. Or, they may not feel the need to identify in any specific way. That’s okay too. 
 Being disabled is not the entirety of my identity, but for me it has provided relief and created a community for me. But no matter your condition, the disabled community is yours and welcomes you no matter how you identify.
 But I swear to God if you come around me and say “beefy,” prepare to be asked to leave, you dirty-mouthed harlot.

Whether or not I’ve fully processed it, I am reaching the end of my college career. As I’ve taken most of my required courses to graduate, I am left with nothing but freedom (in the form of open electives). For my upper division communication elective, no class piqued my interest on the fall registrar more than Los Angeles: Communication and Culture, taught by Josh Kun. Through this class, we’ve explored the complexities of L.A. as a whole, discussed the paradoxical nature of the city and addressed many of the myths surrounding it. However, none have stuck with me quite like the paradigm of the L.A. anti-intellectual. 
For many, L.A. is a city of glitz, glamour and triviality. This is a phenomenon explored in many texts and films since the inception of the city. How could you be serious in a place that has beach weather for three quarters of the year? In a city where movies are made and celebrities run amok? In a city that isn’t so much a city, but a conglomerate of neighborhoods connected by nothing but arduous freeways?
For those who aren’t from here, Angelenos can seem like, as put best by Eve Babitz, sons and “daughters of the wasteland.” However, Babitz, in her books, revels in L.A. and its supposed unseriousness. What’s so wrong with endless sunshine? What’s so wrong with having a good time? Babitz, a native Angeleno,  was a prolific writer and novelist. Yet, at the time her books were published — during what should have been the most pivotal years of her career — the public was dissuaded from her books and her lifestyle. She was scorned for flaunting partying and promiscuity with her books taken out of print. Babitz is just one example of what many believe to be the plague that L.A. brings upon its citizens. In short, the city has been touted for a lack of intellectual activity, for unaligned priorities for one reason or another, and USC’s priorities as an institution plays into that culture. 
USC claims to be a liberal arts institution, requiring each and every student to take a diverse range of courses in addition to their major courses as a baseline of education. However, from what I’ve witnessed, most students just scourge and rage about requirements and treat them as just that: requirements. Once the general education courses have been completed, one’s courses are all for one’s major or minor and for the rest of your undergraduate career, this is all that matters. Depending on your field of study, it quite often happens that classes serve as instructions on how to do one’s job, as opposed to simply being learning for learning’s sake. In another one of my communication classes, one of my other electives that had no pre-professional emphasis at all, my professor reported that in her worst course evaluations, students complained that the course wouldn’t help them get a job. But, we often forget about the soft skills and knowledge outside of our little major bubble that we gain from stepping out of our required classes.
For those within less specific areas of study, typically those underneath the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, it feels as though USC pushes career fairs and job opportunities towards lines of work that are more likely to produce income than fulfillment. Career fairs are filled with consultant firms and sales positions — meanwhile, the School of Cinematic Arts has a running Google document linking internships akin to a glorified Substack. As I can attest, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism has extremely diverse and proficient career services, but not every student is in Annenberg. 
This narrative is one that affects the student body. Questions like “What are you doing?” and “Where are you working?” take far precedence over “What are you studying?”. Pre professional fraternities mix socialization and jobs. There’s a common sentiment of insecurity over LinkedIn posts and the feeling of not doing enough, as someone will always have a better internship, a better job, and it will be five months earlier than you have even started applying. When all of this is going on, when you’re constantly stressed about bolstering your resume, classes can begin to feel like an afterthought, things to be pushed to the side in pursuit of locking in career opportunities to be concurrent with one’s education or secured for a seamless postgraduate transition. Work hard, play hard, run yourself into the ground and get a job or perish. 
Do not get me wrong. All of these resources are extremely coveted, and are a luxury and privilege to have access to. For many, higher education is an opportunity to obtain a more lucrative career than a high school degree would offer. But, at times it seems that we forget that education is education, and not just a means to an end. In this day and age, money is a necessity. But while we are still undergraduates, let’s focus on expanding our arsenal with all the knowledge we can before we jump right into job interviews and become yet just another cog in our country’s capitalist machine.
