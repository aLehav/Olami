After their gut-wrenching loss to Cal, USC men’s basketball travels to the Pac-12 mountain schools to play Utah on Thursday night and Colorado on Sunday.
The Utes (11-4, 2-1) are 8-1 this season at the Huntsman Center, taking their only loss to the University of San Francisco on Dec. 22. Despite the loss of incumbent Pac-12 Player of the Year Jakob Poeltl, who was selected in the first round of the NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors, Utah returns an immensely deep roster. Head coach Larry Krystkowiak’s arsenal includes nine players earning at least seven minutes per game, including six players averaging double digits on the season.
Yet again, Utah is led by experienced forwards. Junior Kyle Kuzma averages 14.8 points and leads the team with 9.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game. Six-foot-10-inch junior David Collette starts in the frontcourt alongside Kuzma. The Utah State transfer debuted as a Ute less than a month ago and scored in double figures in every game this season. He leads the Utes offense in scoring (15.4 points per game) and shooting percentage (.662).
In the past, Krystkowiak’s teams have been known for their half-court prowess but slow pace of play. This year, however, the Utes average as many possessions per 40 minutes as the Trojans. This is one reason why the Utes average 80 points per game. Another is that they shoot 58.3 percent from inside the arc — the sixth best in the nation. The Trojans must protect the rim or else Kuzma, Collette and company will have a field day. 
With sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright out until at least February with a knee sprain, USC will continue to expect large contributions from the forwards — freshman Nick Rakocevic and redshirt senior Charles Buggs. Both alternate in and out of the rotation whenever the other picks up a foul, and each has struggled enormously with foul trouble. Rakocevic averages 6.75 fouls per 40 minutes and Buggs an even worse 7.3. Utah’s bigs will undoubtedly challenge the duo, and they cannot afford to foul cheaply. 
Sunday’s challenger Colorado (10-6, 0-3) also defends its home court well, going 7-1 thus far this season. The Buffaloes play their Pac-12 home opener Thursday night against UCLA. 
Colorado plays slower than Utah, and they average six fewer points. The team features a talented backcourt but one that has a meager 1:1 assist-to-turnover ratio. Senior guard Derrick White leads the team in scoring with 15.8 and with 4.1 assists, but he also turns the ball over 2.8 times per game. Fellow senior Xavier Johnson averages 14.7 points per game, and he lit up Arizona’s defense with 26 points on Saturday. 
Like Utah, Colorado fields a deep roster. Coach Tad Boyle rotates five bench players, and he starts five upperclassmen, including four seniors. USC is a much younger team and will have to play smarter than the experienced Buffs and win the turnover battle.
Junior guard Jordan McLaughlin looks forward to the challenge of achieving bounceback victories. 
“We will prepare like we did this week for the Bay games,” McLaughlin said. “Since the Oregon loss, we’ve had some of our hardest practices of the year. Next week should be fun.”

Following a narrow defeat against Penn State, the USC men’s volleyball team looks to take all the positive aspects from their game and build on them in order to be victorious at home against Long Beach State on Wednesday.
“We did things at a level that we could win,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “Next to add to that is a little bit more flow and transition, a little better route, a little smarter swing and a little bit more physicality or intelligence.”
The Trojans will have to find a response for Long Beach State’s sophomore outside hitter TJ DeFalco, who leads his team with 37 kills in three shutout victories. 
While teams in other sports can rely on the advantage of containing a player with a double-team, the net prevents that type of defense in volleyball. Because of this, the goal becomes less of stopping DeFalco from performing, but rather responding to his performance on the Trojans’ side of the net.
“He is just going to do some things that are going to be great because he is that caliber of a player,” Nygaard said. “But if we can consistently put a good, strong block and defense in front of him, not allow him to get little chip shots out or tips and we maximize every single opportunity, then we will put the pressure back on them to perform.”
With senior Lucas Yoder’s career high 33 kills against Penn State — which almost outpace DeFalco’s total for the season — his power at the outside hitter position will be key in helping the Trojans to a victory for both this game and for the rest of the season.
“He played at a level that was, for what I think of his ability, at the standard,” Nygaard said. “I think that is what he is capable of on a consistent basis.”
As the 49ers are currently 3-0, it will take a team effort in order to finish each set strong. At practice, Nygaard focused on making sure that his players were more focused on reinforcing their system than their opponents’ ranking or record.
“My belief system is that if you are doing what you are supposed to be doing, they can play the best match of their lives and we still should be able to take of it,” Nygaard said. “It is a tough match-up, that is no question. They play a real good style of volleyball, but I happen to believe that if we are taking care of our stuff on our side of the net we should have a good outcome.”
Even with the graduation of four seniors at the end of last season, the team has continued to evolve in Nygaard’s second year as head coach. The addition of eight freshmen also ensures that this progress does not stop at the end of the season when more seniors graduate.
“I am extremely proud of the work we are putting in,” Nygaard said. “I am getting some guys who are becoming workhorses for USC.”

It’s now over a week since it happened. The college football season also officially ended Monday, after Clemson completed a comeback that rivals even ’SC’s. We’ve even had a couple of Trojans declare for the NFL draft already, adding a bittersweet touch to an otherwise perfectly rosy season. 
It’s now perfectly acceptable for Trojan fans to start looking ahead to the 2017 season. As sports editor Julia Poe pointed out last week, there are an endless number of reasons to already be excited about what the program has next in store. 
Personally, though, I’m still soaking in the Trojans’ epic Rose Bowl victory. Maybe it’s my overly nostalgic inner senior showing again, and I’ll officially transition into full-on 2017 hype soon enough. But for the time being, I’ll still be reminiscing on the most recent win more than I’ll be thinking about the next game. 
I don’t need to rehash any specific moments from the game one more time — I’m sure you watched it, too. But the significance of USC’s performance against Penn State is something that I still think is worth talking about because it truly was remarkable within the context of USC’s recent program history. 
For those of us Trojan fans who were spoiled and grew up right at the ascent of the USC Golden Age — basically, anyone who is a current senior and got a Rose Bowl win as the cherry on top of our undergraduate football experience — we got to see a lot of USC victories in major bowl games. Six, to be exact. 
In fact, my first real memory of watching a USC football game while being old enough to appreciate and be invested in the implications of the result was the 2003 Orange Bowl, when the Carson Palmer-led Trojans resoundingly beat an overmatched Big Ten opponent in Iowa. Throw in another Orange Bowl victory, plus an absurd four Rose Bowl wins — all in a seven-year span — and that’s more BCS bowl victories than I can count on one hand.
Every single one was by double digits. Every. Single. One. In fact, each one of those six bowl wins was by at least two touchdowns. Iowa in the ’03 Orange Bowl was 38-17; Michigan in the ’04 Rose Bowl was 28-14; Oklahoma in the ’05 Orange Bowl was a glorious 55-19; Michigan Rose Bowl Round No. 2 in ’07 was 32-18; Illinois was just happy to be there in a 49-17 ’08 Rose Bowl mismatch, and the ’09 Rose Bowl was another sound 32-18 win for the Trojans over Penn State. Of course, the one bowl loss in that span is arguably the most famous out of any of the games  — yep, still hurts — but a mere single exception in that span doesn’t take away from how remarkable that run was. 
So going into the Rose Bowl, there was a tiny bit of a feeling that maybe, finally, USC was due for a regression in its unheard-of recent bowl success. But that was quickly overtaken by the old Arrogant Nation sky-high confidence. 
USC had gotten its vintage swagger back. By the end of the season, the Trojans could walk into any stadium in the country with the unequivocal belief that they would win — because they were USC, and they probably would. Throw in some pre-season rankings bias on my part, resulting in some skepticism that Penn State really was on Michigan or Ohio State’s level and capable of running with the Trojans, and my confidence was through the roof. Not that USC would find a way to win against Penn State, but that USC was just definitively better than Penn State, like it was against anyone else. The outcome would never be in doubt. Why would it be?
The term “Fight On” has been a brand of the school, and especially the football program, for as long as I can remember. But in my generation, it was not an actual call to battle. It was just a trademark, the signature USC salute, like a “Hook ’Em” at Texas or a “War Eagle” at Auburn. It never meant what the literal message conveys. It never meant anything. We just said it. We all did, all the time. 
But USC football during the peak of the Pete Carroll’s dynasty never symbolized the comeback spirit. The Trojans weren’t the epitome of the “never give up” mentality. USC football was just better than everyone. The offense was faster, the defense was stronger, the coach was cooler, the band was louder and the team was just better. I can’t remember a single time during that seven-season stretch when the Trojans didn’t go into a game favored. They didn’t need to come back. They just won. 
That’s what makes this Rose Bowl victory so special. It wasn’t just a Hollywood ending, the conclusion to a storybook season. It’s a coming of age journey for a program and its fan base. If anything, USC football’s reputation during its post-sanction rebuilding phase was the opposite of fighting on, noted for as many blown leads in Utah and surrendered Hail Marys as upsets over Stanford. When head coach Clay Helton talked about how his players “fought on” all of the Rose Bowl and all season, this was really the first time that term was actually warranted to describe this program. 
Now I know that the ultimate success of a program in American sports depends on championships. If you ain’t first, you’re last. That will always be the expectation with a program like USC, as it should. But there is still plenty of pride to take in winning a game known as the “Granddaddy of Them All.” Before we start mentally chasing after the next one, let’s soak in this one. 
So until at least Signing Day, I don’t want to talk about how high USC will project in the preseason AP Poll, how easily redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold will run away with the Heisman or how much we want junior Adoree’ Jackson to stay for one more year. OK, fine, I’ll admit it, I’ll probably cheat on that one and check Twitter incessantly until he announces, but I would be just fine with him ending his Trojan career on a Rose Bowl win.
When I walked into the bookstore on Monday to get my supplies for the semester, they were still looping highlights of sophomore kicker Matt Boermeester’s game-winning field goal to the audio of Pete Arbogast’s radio call. And there I was, standing in line, buying two legal pads, and getting the chills.

Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold continues to rack up silverware after a breakout rookie season, this time being named first-team Freshman All-American by the Football Writers Association of America on Monday.
Darnold adds the accolade to his Rose Bowl offensive MVP, Archie Griffin Award and Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year honor. He is the second USC signal-caller in history to be named to the team after Todd Marinovich in 1989.
During a season that catapulted the 19-year-old into national relevance, Darnold racked up more than 3,000 passing yards to go with 31 touchdowns (and just 9 interceptions). His historic Rose Bowl performance was the cherry on top, as he threw for five scores and accounted for nearly 500 yards of offense. He didn’t throw a single incompletion as he led the fierce Trojan comeback in the fourth quarter.
The FWAA also selected head coach Clay Helton as the First Year Co-Coach of the Year alongside Virginia Tech’s Justin Fuentes. Helton’s job security was under scrutiny after USC’s slow start to its 2016 campaign, but a nine-game winning streak to end the season (USC’s longest since 2008-09) put all doubts to rest.
Achieving a famous Trojan trifecta for just the 13th time in the program’s history, Helton led his squad to wins over UCLA and Notre Dame this fall in addition to their Rose Bowl victory.
Helton also coached his team to wins over both eventual Pac-12 finalists, Colorado and Washington — the latter of which was later selected to the College Football Playoff. In addition to his first-year coaching honors, Helton is a finalist for the Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award, which will be handed out on Wednesday.

In the afterglow of Clemson’s national championship victory Monday, the Associated Press released its final rankings for the 2016-17 college football season. The list placed USC as the No. 3 team, marking the program’s first return to the top five since 2008. 
The distinction, however early, is a final mark of the massive turnaround led by head coach Clay Helton. The AP ranked USC only beneath Clemson and Alabama, and ahead of Washington, Oklahoma and Ohio State.
This year’s team entered the season ranked No. 20 before taking a brutal 52-6 beating at the hands of Alabama to open the season in Arlington. The defeat dropped the Trojans out of the rankings, and subsequent losses to Stanford and Utah took the team even lower as they fell to a 1-3 record.
But then the Trojans started winning. After righting their record to above .500, a mid-season 26-13 stunner over No. 4 Washington took the team to No. 15 and a rivalry win over Notre Dame lifted them into the top ten. USC rounded out the season ranked No. 9 when they took down No. 5 Penn State in a thrilling Rose Bowl finale.
The top-three ranking comes as a continuation of this turnaround, which began with the decision to start redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold. The next step lies in which recruits sign with the Trojans on Feb. 1 and how the Trojans can continue to build.

Following the tragic deaths of Star Wars icon Carrie Fisher and her mother, Debbie Reynolds, the Oscar-nominated singer-actress, HBO took a tender look back at the women’s close relationship and their illustrious careers in the documentary Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.
Though Bright Lights did spend some time reflecting on Fisher’s and Reynolds’ famous roles, directors Fisher Stevens and Alexis Bloom gave viewers access to the private rather than public aspects of their lives. This was done through an extensive archive of home videos and interviews, which give the audience a deeper insight into these women than one can glean from tabloids or movie screens.
Bright Lights’ focus on the intimate aspect of their relationship stripped away the typical glossy images of Fisher and Reynolds as international sensations and simply revealed them as people. Rather than regurgitating a record of their awards and distinctions, Stevens and Bloom crafted character studies that revealed the intelligence and strength of these women, who both shared a charm and sense of humor that made their interactions delightfully entertaining to watch.
By the end of the documentary, the audience is profoundly moved by the intensity of the mother-daughter relationship; although their personalities were vastly distinct (Fisher was blunt and outspoken whereas Reynolds embodied the “classy” persona of Old Hollywood), the women were tirelessly supportive of one another and shared a deep understanding. Bright Lights leaves viewers with an intimate portrait of the sweet and incredibly strong relationship between Fisher and Reynolds, best friends who also happened to be some of the world’s most renowned stars.
However, most of the downsides of Bright Lights occurred when the directors attempted to give the audience an overview of the lives of their distinguished subjects, which included looking back at both the highlights of their enormous careers and the major moments in their public lives. Because of the expanse of ground to cover, many parts of the film came across as rushed and perfunctory, as if the viewer were skimming a Wikipedia article of Fisher and Reynolds’s lives rather than getting to know them on a deeper level.
The storytelling of Bright Lights suffered due to this excess of material in other ways as well. Though parts of the documentary feel rushed, many others consist of padding that both needlessly increased the length of the film and diverted the viewer’s attention away from the most intriguing aspect of the film: the relationship between Fisher and Reynolds. 
The scenes that revealed their intimacy — such as Fisher crying over her aging mother’s debilitation or the two sharing a conversation — are much more memorable than Fisher signing autographs or Reynolds’ showcase of Hollywood memorabilia. This failure of the filmmakers to select their footage more discerningly and to identify the meat of their subject led to a meandering narrative with an unfortunate lack of focus.
Though Bright Lights is often unfocused, the documentary is a gentle and sweet humanization of two global stars, remembering its subjects with fondness and revealing the best parts of their personalities. The HBO documentary allowed viewers to look back on Fisher and Reynolds not only as legendary performers, but also as human beings who loved and supported each other through the best and worst of times. For both their monumental talents and their loyalty to one another, they will be sorely missed.

Weezer’s first album, Weezer, also nicknamed “The Blue Album,” saw universal acclaim both critically and financially. Songs like “Buddy Holly” and, my personal favorite, “Undone — The Sweater Song” shot to the top of the charts and found love among their new fans.
It seemed as if grunge would finally be dethroned because alternative rock was on the rise with a band like Weezer — from there, the future could only get brighter. At least, that’s how it should have been before critics nearly derailed the band’s career.
After the first album, frontman River Cuomo struggled with the drawbacks that came with fame.  As a result, he wanted the next album to reflect the inner demons he had to battle and give fans an insight into the dark thoughts that rattled around in his brain constantly. Compared to the success of their first album, Pinkerton was panned by critics and fans alike. Even Rolling Stone readers called it “the third worst album of 1996” when it was released.
 Since then, people’s perception of the album has changed. And as a matter of fact, it is now hailed as one of Weezer’s better albums. However, the initial negative reviews caused irreparable damage to the band’s psyche. Cuomo has been quoted saying he “never want[ed] to play those songs again.”
 The underlying question is whether or not music should be reviewed in the first place. Pitchfork and Rolling Stone made their millions by being critics of music, telling people whether or not they should spend their money on the work an artist has put out. For an album like Pinkerton, these reviews are critiquing artists’ personal lives that are manifested through their music, which is likely their livelihood.
 And of course, there are endless sources to find reviews of music, from the entrepreneurial Forbes to the cancerous comment sections of YouTube videos. But most of these reviewers likely have never even picked up an instrument before and couldn’t tell you where “C” is on the piano (hint: it’s a white note). What gives them the right to judge the work of someone who makes music professionally? What gives me the right?
 Truthfully, I think people forget that a review is an opinion of the reviewer. The reviewer, if they did their homework, sat down and listened to a song or album multiple times, made note of all the nuances they possibly could and thought about how all of the instrumentation, production, concepts, lyrics (if any), sequencing, mastering and other elements came together to form a work of art. Finally, they give their honest opinion about it. This is where looking at music with a critical eye gets tricky.
I’m sure everyone’s had a moment where they’ve played their favorite song among friends expecting a vehemently positive reaction but gotten an indifferent “Yeah, this is good, I guess” response instead. People simply have different tastes in music due to their background or experiences they’ve had in life.
 The saying “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure” is aptly applied to music preferences. Over the break, I showed a friend of mine “Bad and Boujee,” a song I think is one of the best, if not the best song, to come out of that abomination we call 2016. My friend, however, thought the opposite and has no problem telling me that I’m an idiot for liking something with a line that goes “You know we winnin’/Yeah, we is not losin’.” Likewise, one reviewer will find your favorite song the greatest thing to sweep the nation and another will say it’s the salt of the earth. So who’s right? Who has the right to say if music is good or bad? Who had the right to say that Pinkerton, despite its insight into the dark corners of a celebrity’s life and the intimate themes it imparts on its audience, is a piece of garbage that never should have seen the light of day?
The easy answer is nobody and everybody. Everyone has a right to form an opinion about the music they listen to, and provided that they truthfully process the songs and albums they hear to come to a thought-out conclusion, everyone can say whether or not they like whatever an artist puts out. But what they say shouldn’t be taken as a universal fact, but rather, for what it is: an opinion. And everyone, myself included, forgets that from time to time.
Even artists can get in a tizzy over a bad review of their work, as a music journalist claims he was assaulted by a member of the Wu-Tang Clan a few years back over a negative review. Reviews aren’t the final say over whether or not something is good or bad, just a jumping -off point for you to make your own opinions.

Of those who watch The Bachelor, there are two types of people: viewers who truly enjoy and are invested in the series, and viewers who tune in every other week or so and hate themselves for it. Until last week, I existed wholly outside of this spectrum because I didn’t watch The Bachelor and thought, with great sanity, that I never would.
 Why? It’s hard to say. Maybe it’s because the show’s women, with their bright primary-color evening gowns and fake eyelashes and ever-present smiles (most noticeable when they’re trying to maintain their composure), seem to be the antithesis of everything I am externally. Maybe it’s because I call myself a feminist, and I thought for sure that this country doesn’t need a reality show where dozens of women compete for a man.
 I’m still not sure if we need a show like The Bachelor. But I do know that last week after watching my first episode, I realized I was wrong for a few reasons about ABC’s corporate love-fest. The newest season’s premiere starring Nick Viall had just aired, and my friend and I were surfing Hulu for something to watch. We thought, “why not?” Neither of us had seen The Bachelor before. Now seemed as good a time as any.
 For those who don’t yet know, The Bachelor is a reality TV show where 30 women vie for a man’s affection. Every week, a few women are eliminated until there is one left, and the bachelor proposes marriage. In the female leading spinoff, The Bachelorette, men compete for one woman’s hand in marriage. The Bachelorette premiered one year after its mother show, and the shows — along with the spinoff Bachelor in Paradise — compose an empire in the world of television.
 Clearly, The Bachelor is less about love than it is about making marketable television. Actually, it’s probably accurate to say that The Bachelor isn’t about love at all. It’s about a lot of things: drama, betrayal, heartbreak and sex, but love doesn’t come close. For the majority of the show, the happiness the contestants feel is temporary: one fleeting moment with Nick before he is whisked away to make eyes at or date or kiss another person.
 Maybe the women on The Bachelor realize this, and maybe they don’t. But to assume that they’re all in the dark, that they all have the same reason for playing, that they’re all the same kind of person, is demeaning and reductive to women everywhere.
Steven Kramer | Daily Trojan
 It’s easy to just hear of the concept of The Bachelor and think, “Oh, those ridiculous girls.” But everything is ridiculous on The Bachelor, not just the women. The set, with its dim lighting and faux-hominess, is ridiculous. The big limo and roses and evidently bottomless wine bottles are ridiculous. And Nick, the bachelor himself, is the most ridiculous.
 Nick, who was runner-up not once, but twice, on The Bachelorette. Nick, who is handsome and well-spoken but who we all know has invested his entire heart and all of his dignity into this ABC sham. Nick, who believes that this last run has to be the one where he finds the girl he’s always been looking for.
 There might be a double-standard here, and the girls (now down to 22 of them) are here to dismantle it. See, The Bachelor doesn’t just generate competitiveness, it requires it. Sure, to be picked for the show you need to be pretty. But as any first-time Bachelor viewer learns 10 minutes into an episode, when everyone in the room is pretty, looks don’t really matter anymore. To make it to the altar, you have to be determined and cunning and strong.
 Call Nick a player, but the women are the ones playing the game.
 Perhaps another stereotype The Bachelor receives criticism for is its pittance of women against each other. After all, despite airy talk of finding love and worrying over broken hearts, this show is a game. And it’s cutthroat. But here’s another thing to consider: Women should be able to be fierce, resourceful, competitive and sexual without being criticized for those qualities.
 Finally, the girls themselves: They are indubitably their own individuals. There is Jaimi, a 28-year-old New Orleans chef, who told Nick that she once had a girlfriend and a relationship that didn’t work out, too. And there’s Rachel, a Dallas lawyer who is also the first black contestant in Bachelor history to receive the coveted First Impression rose (which basically means Rachel is here to stay).
 Admittedly, The Bachelor is not quality television. In fact, it is pretty bad television. But that doesn’t make it immoral or unprogressive or demeaning to women. In fact, it’s the opposite: The Bachelor survives because of strong women. Their insistence that they know Nick is The One for them, if he would only just realize it, is certainly naive but also unquestionably brave.
 Playing The Bachelor takes guts, fire and a fierce sense of self-confidence that no one — not other girls, not yourself and least of all Nick — can beat down. And to be able to don your best evening gown (or shark suit), strut onto a television set, and state with all your strength that your future husband is on the other end of this spectacle? In the realm of romance, what’s more ambitious than that?

Art will take over Downtown as the LA Art Show, a showcase of modern works, comes to the Los Angeles Convention Center Wednesday.
 Since the LA Art Show’s inception in 1995, the show has grown to cover 200,000 square feet, and will feature 90 galleries and 20,000 works of art this year. The show has attracted about 70,000 visitors in the past and generated $30 million in sales, and this year will be no exception for the highly anticipated event.
 The show will open Wednesday evening with a premiere party that will give attendees a special sneak peek of the show. The party will include a reception and private viewing of many of the works to be featured in the LA Art Show, including paintings, sculptures, photography, videos, performance art and more.
 Additionally, the party will offer cuisine by Chef Jeffrey Nimer of Haute Chefs LA, Oysters OX and Nespresso, as well as performances by the Whitney Myer Trio and others. Tickets for the Opening Night Premiere Party range from $125 to $250, with proceeds from the event going to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
 This year, the LA Art Show features some of the most diverse range of exhibits, with many international works from countries such as China, France, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain and the U.K.
 “In recent years, the arrival of emerging artists and the opening of some of the world’s finest galleries and museums in Los Angeles has turned the city into a hub for contemporary art,” said Marisa Caichiolo, the LA Art Show’s independent curator, in a statement on this year’s event.
 Caichiolo noted, however, that there will be a larger focus on art from Latin America to create a dialogue between art and ethnic communities and cultural institutions throughout Southern California.
 “To reflect the world’s changing art trends and the importance of Latino heritage in Los Angeles, this year’s LA Art Show is engaging with the Getty to highlight its 2017 Pacific Standard Time LA/LA initiative, a rare opportunity to discover and enjoy the vast and rich world of Latin American and Hispanic art for thousands of visitors, viewers and art lovers,” she said.
 Among the thousands of pieces at the show, some of featured exhibits will include “The Art of Luis Buñuel,” presented by Luis Buñuel Film Institute to pay tribute to the legendary Mexican filmmaker and artist who created work highlighting social injustice, cruelty, religion and eroticism.
 Also featured are “Dichotomy Bifurcation,” an award-winning video painting by Lindsay Scoggins — who has received much acclaim after her YouTube success — and “Submerge.” a laser installation by Marc Brickman.
 Single-day general admission tickets are available for $30, and four-day passes come at $60. There is also a $5 discount for both types of passes if purchased online. 
 The art show will take place from Wednesday to next Monday. More information can be found online.

At the end of 2016, Republican congressional leaders announced their intent to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and slash funding for Planned Parenthood. Opponents of reproductive rights have already taken bold steps since the election of the anti-abortion Trump-Pence administration. State legislatures in Indiana, Texas, Ohio, Oklahoma and others passed more than 60 restrictions on access to abortion in 2016 alone and are slated to vote on additional restrictions immediately in the new year. In light of these threats, through ballots, education, activism and — ultimately — staying informed, millennials can and must use their voices to fight for everyone’s continued ability to access reproductive healthcare.
Numerous liberal thinkers and leaders, from political talk show host Bill Maher to former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, suggested the failure of the Democratic Party in this election was rooted in the purported focus on “identity politics” and social issues instead of the frustrations of the working class. The most dangerous aspect of this analysis is that it suggests identity-related issues, such as reproductive rights, should be ignored to advance a political party at the direct expense of women of reproductive age across the nation. Futhermore, this perspective ignores the fact that access to reproductive healthcare is an issue of high importance to many Americans, especially young adults. The ability to control one’s body is linked to upward mobility and educational success. President-elect Donald Trump has demonstrated alarming apathy for women’s ability to access safe, legal abortion. Perhaps most prominently, Trump suggested women should be punished for having abortions. Vice President-elect Mike Pence notoriously defunded Planned Parenthood in his state of Indiana and redirected funding for low-income families to anti-choice organizations. In November, House Speaker Paul Ryan identified birth control as merely a “nitty gritty” detail of healthcare policy.
Despite these challenges to women’s ability to access crucial healthcare, the issue of reproductive rights continues to be dismissed. Such a perspective ignores, for women from all walks of life, the importance of access to the resources necessary to control their bodies. To access reproductive healthcare, financially dependent and low-income women, many of whom are millennials, rely on the government to acknowledge their struggle and make reproductive resources a financial priority. The Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate is the source of 67 percent of insured American women’s free birth control and 80 percent of Planned Parenthood’s millions of patients, on top of access to breast exams, pap smears, STD testing and other reproductive health services from the organization.
Indeed, recent reproductive healthcare initiatives have enjoyed considerable success. A study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in August revealed that wider access to contraception had substantially decreased teenage pregnancy and birth rates between 2007 and 2013. Under President Barack Obama, the national abortion rate dropped from 16 abortions for every 1,000 women to 12.5 from the beginning of the Bush administration, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. 
On top of this, in 2015, economists predicted that defunding Planned Parenthood would cost the federal government $130 million every 10 years, with young women paying the price — and unable to access basic healthcare. Investing in contraception and sexual health education for young women directly results in fewer unwanted pregnancies, abortions and poor and often single mothers becoming trapped in poverty after being forced to drop out of school.
Roe v. Wade itself can no longer single-handedly ensure that women’s dignities and rights as born, incontrovertibly living humans will be prioritized over fertilized eggs and fetuses. Only the continued advocacy  of politically active women can guard against this influx of legislative and cultural opposition to reproductive rights. Despite being most vulnerable to these attacks on the ability to make the choice, young women also wield far more power than they are led to believe. 
Roe v Wade will be overturned within the next 4 years, because the gaslighting of the left to make you feel good and secure in your decision to murder your baby over rules caring for the rights of a human life.  RvW was approved when there weren’t that many types of birth control; however, today there are so many forms of birth control that a woman can use to take care of her body, her life, her emotional spirit, that abortion is no longer needed.  Abortion is also legalized genocide, and do you want to be a part of that movement? Really?  Forget the religious issues a lot of folks have to deal with; it’s the fact that the alt-left, which comprises most of the Democratic Party over the past 50 years, have put out messaging to young women that it’s OK to have unprotected sex, because you can always have an abortion.  Why not take control over your healthcare in a positive way, instead of a negative and hateful, cruel selfish manner?
There are so many couples out there that cannot have children, such as sterile couples and same sex couples that want to have a child!  You can take care of 4 souls by keeping the baby.  Yours, the baby’s, and the couple.  Isn’t that a much better way to add karma to your life, than ripping a human being, your baby, from your womb?
Think about it, kids.
You are being gaslighted by the left, over and over again, to believe that it’s OK, when in fact abortion, for the sale of birth control, is not OK, just because it’s legal.  It will be repealed soon, and the law will allow for abortion to be used when the life of the mother is at stake….  not the health of the mother.

The 115th Congress is already in session, and before making final decisions about healthcare and tax reform, a different change may soon be made. After a video of Democratic congressmembers protesting gun laws with a sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives was published on social media, House Speaker Paul Ryan proposed earlier this month that legislators  should be fined for publishing video and photos from the House floor on their social media platforms. This repudiation of social media platforms for disseminating ugly truths is a threat not only to journalistic freedom and integrity, but also to democracy.
Though President-elect Donald Trump’s use of social media has been in the spotlight recently, another phenomenon that greatly affected the election must be considered — voter presence on social media and the dissemination of political views on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.  Both proved to be instrumental in facilitating political discussion and presenting unique and valid perspectives.
As their main news provider, social media occupies an extraordinary part of the lives of millennials. Now, it is also an essential part of the democratic process.
In this untraditional news cycle, the traditional news media has been criticized heavily. The New York Times has since published an apology for its sub-par reporting during the election and offered a recommitment to the values it stands for. Several other publications, including the Los Angeles Times, The Huffington Post and Forbes, attributed the failure of the news media to elitism, lack of diversity in the newsroom and other issues.
However, while traditional news outlets focused on sensational op-eds, social media increasingly took on the role of furthering democracy. Facebook encouraged users to vote by using banners to remind them to register to vote, providing information guides for ballots and encouraging them to post about the importance of voting. Additionally, because of the prevalence of political discussion on Twitter, millennials felt engaged in and informed about the election, though that did not translate directly into record-breaking voting rates.
Citizens received information about their candidates quicker than ever before — in part because of social media. Citizens  on Facebook and Twitter were constantly exposed to political discourse, even while simply scrolling through their feeds. The phenomenon of “stumbling upon news” meant that more citizens felt that they were informed about the election — there was just no way around it.
In coming election cycles, Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets must focus on revamping their algorithms to truly ensure that social media evolves into a productive, respectful and less divisive forum for discussion. Currently, social media certainly has its faults, but it has the potential to be one of the most dynamic mechanisms of democracy in our generation. The voice of a politically engaged teenager in Kansas can be just as loud as that of a Republican congressmember’s, and such a powerful tool must be utilized effectively.
In the age of social media, attaining balanced and truthful news is both the responsibility of the consumers and the producers. Because of the increasing number of content producers and the burgeoning market for confirmation bias, there will always be fake and partisan news. It is up to ethically committed publications and educated citizens to break through this unfortunate trend and return to the original purpose of journalism: seeking the truth. Social media outlets have a unique potential to advance this purpose and present their users with a well-rounded, diverse and educated set of viewpoints to inform their political decisions. In The Elements of Journalism, Tom Rosenstiel and Bill Kovach claim that journalism should aim to provide “a forum for public criticism and compromise.” Additionally, the authors say that journalism must educate the electorate in a manner that allows them to make informed decisions. Social media accomplishes these objectives admirably well, and attempts like those of Ryan to censor it ought to be starkly repudiated.

The USC Shoah Foundation will implement 100 Days to Inspire Respect, an initiative aimed at providing teachers easy-to-use tools to address important and sensitive classroom topics. Starting Jan. 20 and ending on April 29, the plan was inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who announced an aggressive 100-day agenda after assuming office in 1933. 
100 Days to Inspire Respect concentrates on middle and high school students and their teachers. Weekly themes will include hatred, racism, civil rights and immigration. Each day, a new IWitness learning activity will be released by USC Shoah Foundation’s Education Department. Multimedia from the Institute’s Visual History Archive, the world’s largest repository of testimony from survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust, will also be provided to teachers and their students on a daily basis.
IWitness is a free educational website with over 1,500 video testimonies, multimedia activities and digital resources. The platform encourages students to participate actively in a type of learning that connect students with the past, engage them in the present and motivates them to build a better future. The IWitness program also encourages students and teachers to enter its annual Video Challenge, in which they compete for over $10,000 in prizes.
Kori Street, director of education at the USC Shoah Foundation, emphasized the power of testimony to make an impact and familiarize students with the importance of testimony as a valuable source of knowledge.
“By completing the learning activities we built around clips of video testimonies from genocide witnesses, high school and middle school students learn about the need for compassion and the importance to make a positive contribution to civil society,” Street said.
Though the mission’s goal is directed at middle and high school students, Street emphasized that USC students can contribute to the initiative as well by watching the testimony, sharing their ideas for further projects and modelling respectful behavior.
The first three days will emphasize the power of testimony to educate the community and connect people. The remaining days will address themes of countering hatred and intolerance. Participating students will familiarize themselves with the different types and expressions of hate, tolerance of competing perspectives and the means by which people are excluded and labeled “othered.”
Succeeding the 2016 presidential election, intimidation and coercion has been reported by teachers across the nation. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there have been over 900 reports of harassment and tyranization in schools. California had the largest number of hate incidents with 99 reports, followed by New York with 69 and Texas with 57. 
Street touched on the importance of this campaign in relation to America’s current political tide.
“Fake news, cyber-bullying and face-to-face bullying are all manifestations of rising divisions and rising hatred and racism,” Street said. “But I think it is important to note that we are not focusing on political partisanship. This isn’t about the President-elect, it’s not about parties. It’s about saying, ‘You know what, we all need to be respectful and empathetic and knowledgeable and engaged.’ We need to find our way back to when we could have political or personal dialog and differences without it descending into an inappropriate Twitter war.”

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum officially accomplished its goal of producing zero waste last month. It is now the largest NFL stadium and the second largest college stadium in America to become a zero waste facility, second only to Ohio State University’s Ohio Stadium. 
Despite having over 1.2 million stadium guests this season, the Coliseum diverted over 400,000 pounds of waste to be recycled, repurposed or composted, accounting for 90 percent of the Coliseum’s waste production. Since the remaining 10 percent of foreign objects are unable to decompose, 90 percent is the industry standard for “zero waste.”
The Coliseum uses a triple-source process to achieve the standard of zero waste. First, attendees sort materials into the service products placed throughout the Coliseum provided by Legends Hospitality. An on-site crew of 80 to 100 staff members sorts further. From the Coliseum, the Athens Services’ waste collection and recycling service facility further categorizes, then recycles, composes and repurposes these materials. These three levels create a set of safety nets, allowing for sorting mistakes and double-checking to ensure that the maximum amount of waste is sustainably disposed. 
“Whether they know it or not, our fans are helping us with every decision that they make,” said Brian Grant, the Coliseum’s director of operations. “It’s entirely a team effort.”
Developing and implementing the Zero Waste Initiative provided considerable challenges to Coliseum coordinators. The Los Angeles Rams, who are tenanting the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum until their stadium in Inglewood is serviceable, received an average attendance of over 70,000 fans this season, according to data by ESPN. This created heavy workloads for Coliseum staff. 
On the same weekends that Trojans games and Rams games were played, waste-disposal time frames were cut to as little as eight hours. On the other hand, the Coliseum has hosted two Olympiads, two Super Bowls and one World Series over the past 93 years. 
“If we can get a stadium that’s almost 100 years old to zero waste, that’s a pretty huge challenge,” Grant said. 
As of now, it is too soon to determine the effects of the program on the Coliseum. Partners such as EcoSafe and Athens Services have helped achieve this sustainability goal by providing products at reduced costs and cash assets. 
Waxie, a Coliseum partner and California-based sanitary corporation, provided financial assistance and reduced-rate janitorial supplies. Grant hopes to prove that the costs of sustainable activity has potential to equate to the costs of contemporary waste systems. 
“With the addition of recycling commodities, we can actually hopefully prove to the nation that these zero-waste programs can actually be cost-neutral,” Grant said. “If other stadiums look at the Coliseum, I hope they see a model that involves a stakeholder theory-driven program that focuses on using resources to make the best decisions possible. Anything is possible when you get the right, committed individuals into a room with a common goal.” 
Ultimately, the Coliseum plans to continue striving for progressive, sustainable action, and hopes to set an example for similar stadiums across the country. Athletic Director Lynn Swann hopes to continue implementing this system of waste management in the upcoming years, as well as supporting new efficient and creative projects that promote progressive and sustainable action. 
“We’re proud to be a part of a program such as the Zero Waste Initiative at the Coliseum.” Swann said. “This is an opportunity for USC Athletics and our fans to lead the way in terms of taking ownership of our environmental impact on game days. Our University, fans and alumni should be proud of the success of this program.”

Benjamin Henwood, an assistant professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, has formed a team of experts to conduct research related to homelessness in Los Angeles.
In Los Angeles County, approximately 47,000 people experienced homelessness in 2016, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. Around one third of this population was chronically homeless. Often, these people are desperately in need of permanent housing to alleviate health and safety concerns.
According to Henwood, the rising average age of chronically homeless people has contributed to the increase in age-related health problems they have.
“People who experience chronic homelessness … are an aging cohort, and they’ve been on the streets for quite some time,” Henwood said. “Twenty years ago, their average age was in their 30s, and now their average age is in their 50s. It’s clear that these people have gotten older, but the services environment hasn’t changed with them.”
In addition, Henwood said that homeless individuals tend to age rapidly due to the harsh environment they live in. Many who would ordinarily not yet be prone to geriatric health issues are suffering from them at a relatively young age.
“Though the average age [of chronically homeless people] is around 50, because of the hard life they’ve led, from a physical standpoint they actually 10 or 20 years older,” Henwood said. “Their life expectancy is about two decades shorter for someone who has experienced long-term homelessness.”
Similar to elderly people, who often face the choice of staying in their current residence or moving to an expensive nursing home with full-time care, chronically homeless individuals often desire to maintain their independence, Henwood said. 
Henwood explained that, though providing them with a home is certainly an achievement, other services performed by permanent housing providers in Los Angeles, such as preventative health measures and treatments for age-related health problems, can allow them to live a more independent, healthy life.
Henwood and his team seek to identify ways to bridge the gap between available health services and those living in permanent housing without access to them. Henwood said that simple solutions, such as a screening process to identify conditions and treatments required, can drastically raise residents’ quality of life.
Moreover, according to Henwood, most of these permanent housing locations for the chronically homeless have health professionals either on site or a short walk away. Therefore, the screening process would allow caseworkers to analyze residents’ potential health issues quickly and refer them to appropriate doctors for treatment or prevention. Thus. the screening serves as a way to pair residents with resources more efficiently.
In addition to the screening process, apartment retrofitting can serve as an effective way to prevent health issues in the future, according to John Lahey, the project coordinator and a graduate of USC’s Masters in Social Work program. Lahey said that simple things like handrails and soft floors installed in units can substantially alleviate the risk of serious injury due to a fall. These, as well as other modifications that can be done to individual apartments as needed, are easy and affordable ways to prevent some health problems from ever occurring.
The first six months of the project will be spent collecting data, followed by focus groups and eventually leading toward helping the Skid Row Housing Trust — the largest provider of permanent housing for the homeless in Los Angeles — implement their findings.

The severe drought in California forced Catalina Island to enter Stage 3 water rationing last Sept., causing a 50 percent reduction in its water allotment, according to the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center. That’s when Elizabeth Shakhnazaryan, a freshman majoring in economics and environmental studies, decided to install 25 additional rain barrels on Catalina Island.
 On campus, Shakhnazaryan works as an ambassador in the Environmental Student Assembly. But Shakhnazaryan’s drive for environmental advocacy started at a young age.
 “My dad would help me collect recycling stuff from parks,” Shakhnazaryan said. “What I used to do then was personal, but after coming to college, I [saw] so many incredible opportunities to expand that and reach beyond just me.”
 Shakhnazaryan’s original ideas included composting, recycling clothes and installing sustainable landscaping at USC. She then met with Karla Heidelberg, a co-sponsor of the proposal and the director of the USC Environmental Studies Program, and Jessica Dutton, the director of special projects at the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies. These faculty members helped Shakhnazaryan devise the implementation of rain barrels on the island. 
 “Jessica brought up the fact that the people at the WMSC are really struggling,” Shakhnazaryan said. “The idea of installing the rain barrels served as an immediate solution to the problem the people on Catalina Island have been facing.”
The USC Green Engagement Fund offered $2,400 grant to support Shakhnazaryan’s project, with the ultimate goal of raising awareness about environmental concerns that affect the community. The grant will help Shakhnazaryan set up the rain barrels along with water meters used to measure the amount of water collected.
Dutton believes the 50 percent water rationing move is both an institutional challenge and an educational opportunity.
“Elizabeth’s initiative will have a significant and timely impact at the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center,” Dutton said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Her project gives us the rain barrels we need to collect and reuse more water at the island, particularly in residential areas.”
 According to Dutton, the initiative will also encourage student awareness and promote participation by all the visitors in the Wrigley Institute’s sustainability practices. 
 The WMSC has 16 existing rain barrels in the cafeteria and dorm areas, which are mainly used to do laundry and wash dishes. If the rain barrels have any extra water left, then the residents can utilize it for their personal use.
 “The additional water that the existing rain barrels had was usually in short supply and [was] used up very quickly,” Shakhnazaryan said. “But after the project [is] complete, they will actually have water to take home for their personal use.”
 Shakhnazaryan’s project will be used mostly by students and faculty at WMSC and for the staff that lives in the housing units at Two Harbors on the island. The 25 rainwater barrels will add up to 1,575 gallons of water, in addition to the water that the existing 16 barrels can hold. Shakhnazaryan hopes to finish the project in a couple of months to get as much water as possible before the start of spring.
 According to Shakhnazaryan, USC can also do a lot to improve the sustainability of the University by installing rain barrels on campus or increasing the number of solar panels on its roofs.
 “I want to do as many projects as possible,” Shakhnazaryan said. “I would love to work with Jessica and Karla again because they were very helpful and helped me put the project in its final form.”
 Shakhnazaryan encouraged students to email their representatives about environmental concerns and get involved with such initiatives by joining the Environmental Student Assembly and the Environmental Core at USC. She added that students can also receive funding from the Green Engagement Fund to implement their own environmental projects.
 Shakhnazaryan hopes to practice environmental law in the future, with her primary goal being to protect environmental interests. 
 “[The environment] is an issue which many put in the back of their heads, and that frustrates me,” Shakhnazaryan said. “It is an immediate problem, and once it becomes something that cannot be ignored, it’s going to be too late to do anything about it.”

A USC-led study aims to explain the neurological reasons behind the growing national political divide.
Conducted by the Brain and Creativity Institute at USC and Project Reason, the study shows how different parts of the brain are activated when an individual is presented a challenge to strongly held political beliefs.
The study gathered 40 self-professed “strong liberals” who were then asked eight political and non-political questions. While political statements came from a small pool of questions, non-political statements were tailored to each person. 
“We started with a series of beliefs that people had previously told us they believed really strongly, so we gave them a scale from one to seven and asked them how strongly they believed these things,” said Jonas Kaplan, lead author of the study and an assistant research professor of psychology at the Brain and Creativity Institute at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “All of these beliefs we showed them while inside the brain scanner were beliefs they had rated six or seven, so they were rated pretty strongly. Then after we [presented] the arguments to them, we asked them again how strongly they believed this.”
According to Kaplan, a change in belief was recorded if an individual modified their response from a higher to a lower ranking on the scale after the counterargument was presented.
This occurred while the participant was in a brain scanner, allowing the study to determine which parts of the brain were activated. Researchers found that the amygdala, insular cortex and default mode network were all triggered more when contrary thinking was presented against political questions than non-political ones. The researchers found that these regions were also activated in people less likely to change their minds.
“The insular cortex is a part of the brain that processes feelings from the body,” said Sarah Gimbel, a co-author of the study and a senior research assistant at the USC Brain and Creativity Institute. “We know from other research that it’s important for emotion and emotional salience — like how emotionally important something is to you. The fact that we saw increased activation in this region … shows us when we feel threatened or anxious or emotional that we’re less likely to change our minds about these strongly held beliefs.”
While the amygdala and the default mode network act as separate mechanisms in the brain, they share similar functions. When challenged, an individual becomes emotional and threatened, which Gimbel said reveals something deeper about politics and personal identity. 
“Activity when the political beliefs are challenged compared to when the non-political beliefs are challenged shows us that these areas of the brain have been linked to thinking about who we are,” Gimbel said. “It’s showing that these strongly held political beliefs have become a part of our sense of self and our sense of identity.”
The study may also have implications for similar kinds of thinking as well. Kaplan believes that the results are not confined to politics, but rather he uses politics as an example of a more general group of ideas that people resist changing their minds about.
“We used politics as a test case because we thought it would be difficult to change people’s minds about political things, and we were testing what happens when we resist changing our minds,” Kaplan said. “We don’t think this process is specific to politics. We think it’s probably more general to everything we think is important to us — so politics, religious beliefs and maybe beliefs about the USC football team if you’re a sports fan.”
No surprise in these data findings.  Political beliefs are indeed analogous to religious beliefs in that both clearly reflect a person’s individual ideas of right and wrong… and in turn, one’s identity.  Therefore any challenge to one’s political or religious view is a challenge to one’s identity, and obviously triggers a defense mechanism in whatever part of the brain controls these behaviours.  Accordingly, I’m always baffled by the belief that people should keep their religion out of their politics.  To do so is completely unnatural.  Most people’s politics are governed or shaped by their religion (or if not religious, then whatever system of morals or values they believe in).  If someone is able to hold a political position that does not comport with their religious or “value” system, I would suggest they live with a preponderance of opinion and a lack of conviction.  I believe this correlation helps explain the brain activity noted in the study.

USC alumni Jessie and Charles Cale have promised $15 million to subsidize and name a residential college in the USC Village, which will open in fall 2017.
The Jessie and Charles Cale Residential College will house up to 320 students and is one of the eight residential colleges located in the Village. The residential college system, implemented for the first time in the 2016-2017 school year, was created by USC Residential Education to help students form connections and build communities, according to the organization’s website. 
Jessie Cale earned a bachelor’s degree from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 1974, while Charles Cale earned a Master’s degree from the USC Gould School of Law in 1966.
Charles Cale is a former member of the USC President’s Leadership Council and a continuing member of the USC Associates. He was elected to the Board of Trustees in April 2016, and was a founding board member of the Women of Troy. In 2011, he and his wife financed the Charles Griffin Cale Director of Athletics’ Chair. 
“Their generosity will expand the horizons of our talented students by immersing them in the active intellectual and social life of the university,” said USC President C. L. Max Nikias, according to USC News.

When Lida Dianti turned on the news and saw Syrian children losing their homes, their families and their very lives, she wanted to help in a sustainable way. Her purpose became to give young Syrians something that could never be taken away from them: education.
Dianti founded the USC chapter of Students Organize for Syria in Fall 2016. The organization tutors students in English as part of their Students Teach for Syria program and co-hosts donation drives with UCLA to support families in El Cajon, a city near San Diego. 
The Syrian Civil War is currently in its sixth year, and millions have been displaced from their homes. Three years ago, the United Nations called the Syrian Civil War “the biggest humanitarian crisis of our era.” Because of the prevalence of information about the war, Dianti is adamant that the purpose of her club is not to raise awareness. 
“People know,” she said. “It’s 2017; we all have iPhones. People are well aware of what’s going on. I’m done having dialogue. I’m done raising awareness. I want action.”
Action is an understatement for Dianti’s role in the club. She spends all her free time on SOS, whether she’s picking up lunch ingredients for the kids, brainstorming ideas for new projects or driving down to El Cajon to help out — a trip she makes every weekend. The dozen or so families she works with in El Cajon know and expect her; they have her number, they know her name and they know her car.
The focus of Dianti’s club is education as she believes it is crucial for refugee children to continue their studies. As a senior majoring in international relations, she had been closely following the conflict. Over a year ago, she began tutoring a Syrian student, someone she still considers a very close friend. After meeting her, Dianti had a personal stake in the war.
“She changed my whole life,” Dianti said. 
Dianti wanted to start a tutoring program here on campus because of the high demand for English speaking tutors. 
In her experience, there are a variety of reasons Syrian children want English tutors. Primarily, students want to be prepared for placement exams so they can get into universities and make a life for themselves outside of their unstable country. Students also need English assistance to fill out applications for jobs, for asylum and for colleges. A third group simply wants to practice their speaking. 
“[When studying a foreign language], it’s very common that reading and writing is easy, but speaking, that can only come from experience and practice,” Dianti said. “The best way to do that is with a native speaker.”
Sofia Deak, vice president of SOS, first got involved as a tutor. 
“I had been looking for a way to help out with the crisis going on in Syria and have a lasting impact on the people who were suffering there,” she said. 
Deak then helped expand SOS’ work to El Cajon and coordinated volunteers for their donation drives, and has had memorable interactions with refugees on each trip. Families invited her in for Arabic tea or coffee (which Dianti raves about), and one family even insisted Deak stay for dinner. Kids hugged and kissed her after receiving gifts, and one man cried of joy after the volunteers bought glasses for him after he was unable to fill his prescription.
“He was grateful for something that we thought was small,” Deak said.
Deak has been studying Arabic for two years, but knowledge of Arabic is by no means a requirement for tutors or volunteers, given the high demand. 
“My Arabic is so bad, but they just want to hang out with you,” Dianti said of her frequent trips to El Cajon. 
She visits nine to 15 families each week and has gotten to know each family well. On Jan. 6, she took a young boy to In-N-Out, and they were laughing and eating together despite the language barrier. She would try to speak Arabic, and he wouldn’t understand. The boy would speak English, and she would get confused, but they would both learn a little as they laughed a lot. 
“It’s genuinely fun,” she said. “It’s like hanging out with family. They need compassion. They need to be treated like human beings because that hasn’t happened to them in a very long time.”
Dianti graduates this year, but she still has new plans for SOS in the works. Her latest is a program that allows USC students to improve their colloquial Arabic skills and allows refugees to earn some money. Students can study Arabic in school, but she feels that it’s focused on reading and writing formally, not conversing casually. Ideally, USC students could have Skype Arabic lessons from, for example, a Syrian mother with young children who can’t leave the house to work, and pay them $15 to $20 an hour. It’s essentially the inverse of the English tutoring program they have in place, but unlike the English program, there isn’t a huge demand for tutors. 
According to Dianti, the hardest part of working with refugees is making promises that are difficult to keep. She said the executive board has no shortage of passion and enthusiasm, but there is a shortage of volunteers, forcing the few dedicated members to overextend themselves and work long hours to ensure they don’t let the refugees down. And yet, they keep doing it, over and over.
“It’s the best thing I’ve done with my life, honest to God,” she said. “They just want people to hang out with, they want to meet Americans, they want to practice English, they want to feel like they’re a part of the community.”

With 1:27 left in the Rose Bowl and his team needing a touchdown to even the score, Sam Darnold had a decision to make.
USC, marching downfield quickly, had a first down at Penn State’s 27-yard line. Taking the snap out of the shotgun, the redshirt freshman quarterback surveyed the field. He surely must have seen junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster wide open in the left flat for an easy 10-yard pick-up. That would have been the safe, conventional play: A first down catch to temporarily stop the clock and set up in the red zone with plenty of time remaining to tie the game.
Out over the middle in the end zone was another option. Sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett had run a post route through the teeth of the Penn State secondary, but he was well covered; linebacker Cam Brown was playing Burnett shallow and safety Marcus Allen was back deep. Any pass would have to be pinpoint accurate, or else it would be a sure interception and a comeback-that-wasn’t.
Very few quarterbacks in the country at any level would have taken that throw over the conventional, no-risk first-down conversion.
But if we’ve learned anything about Darnold, it’s that he’s hardly conventional, and that a high-risk, high-reward play is essentially his bread and butter.
It didn’t take long for offensive coordinator Tee Martin to realize he had something special in Darnold.
The redshirt freshman’s first career start was a 31-27 loss at Utah, but he had played well. Darnold completed 18 of 26 passes for 253 yards and had his team in position for a win until a last-second touchdown gave the victory to Utah.
Listening in on his headphones upstairs, Martin saw a certain bravado in the way Darnold conducted himself both on the bench and on the field.
“For me, listening upstairs from what he was saying on the sideline, he has this macho leadership about him, a sense of confidence,” Martin said. “I think the guys feed off that. I thought he did a good job of managing the offense and making plays, too. There were some decisions out there that he made that was next-level type stuff.”
The following week, Darnold earned his first career win in a breakout performance at home against Arizona State. By halftime, he had 212 yards passing. He finished with 352w yards in the air for three touchdowns as the offense dropped 41 points on the Sun Devils.
His teammates started coming around to him, welcoming a revamped offense after the early-season struggles under then-starting quarterback Max Browne. Darnold’s dual-threat ability had become apparent.
“It was exciting to see a guy like [Darnold],” junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson said. “He can run the ball, throw the ball and run while he’s throwing.”
By now, head coach Clay Helton also probably knew the talent he had unleashed in Darnold. But the following week against Colorado, USC barely scraped by with a 21-17 win after the quarterback was responsible for three of the team’s four turnovers, fumbling twice and throwing his first career interception. Still, Darnold threw for 358 yards, his most of the season. And USC had just beaten the Pac-12 South leader.
So Helton didn’t make turnovers too much of a concern. He knew a quarterback as aggressive as Darnold would commit errors. He didn’t want Darnold becoming a robot. After the game, Helton reinforced that message to his quarterback, telling him to “drive it like you stole it.”
“You play the game with no fear and he does,” Helton said. “He does some things that people can’t do, so you let him do it.”
Lo and behold, Darnold came back strong the following week against Arizona and proved his coach right. Under the scorching Tucson sun, Darnold torched the Wildcats for five touchdown passes, throwing, scrambling and running circles all over the defense. Up big in the fourth, Helton pulled Darnold and the starters and put in the second unit. He expected the first-year starter — fresh off the best performance of his young career — to come off the field and give him a smile. Instead, he got a promise.
“Coach, there’s more out there,” Darnold said to Helton.
Specifically, Darnold was upset at a few deep balls that didn’t connect with receivers.
“You saw the long balls in the first half,” Darnold said. “Guys were open and I missed them.”
“He’s a perfectionist,” Helton added. “He’d be a great coach one day. He’s one of those guys that expects perfection and demands it of himself — as well as his teammates — and that’s important.”
Darnold answered his own call by dropping another five-touchdown performance the next week against Cal, and then led USC’s 45-20 rout over Oregon on Nov. 5.
That set up a date on the road with then-No. 4 Washington, an unbeaten team looking to ruin Darnold’s darling season. But the redshirt freshman stood his ground, out-dueling Heisman Trophy contender Jake Browning and silencing the raucous Husky Stadium crowd.
Both of his touchdown passes were vintage Darnold plays — tough throws to the back of the end zone and absolute lasers that were right on the money — but the one to redshirt freshman tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe to give USC a two-score lead in the fourth quarter would be a harbinger of things to come. On third-and-goal, Darnold rifled a pass over multiple defenders right into the outstretched arms of Imatorbhebhe, who hauled it in.
It was such a risky throw that redshirt junior defensive back Chris Hawkins thought it would be intercepted.
“It was one of the most beautiful passes I’ve ever seen,” he told Darnold on the sideline.
If he hadn’t by then, Imatorbhebhe definitely had gained complete faith in his quarterback.
“I don’t question Sam anymore,” he said. “I know he’s going to put it right where I can catch it, so it’s my job to catch it. He can make pretty much every throw on the field.”
The upset over Washington was the ultimate confirmation: This kid out of San Clemente was the real deal, and in a span of weeks, had gone from backup redshirt freshman to the quarterback of the future. But just for good measure, Darnold led the Trojans to blowouts over rivals UCLA and Notre Dame to end the season on an eight-game win streak.
And before USC’s postseason game, Martin had one more prophetic quote on Darnold.
“He’s going to push the defense and see how much he can get,” Martin said after the UCLA game. “He’s like a kid playing around the stove until he gets burned, but he’s going to pull his hand up. He’s like the kid who’s going to put his hand as close as he can again the next time.”
If it wasn’t apparent already, it’s clear that Darnold wouldn’t just settle for a simple little dump-off to the flat. Not if he can help it. And definitely not in the fourth quarter of a one-score game in the Rose Bowl.
No, Darnold didn’t care that he had plenty of time on the clock. Didn’t care that it was first down and not fourth down. Didn’t care that he was ignoring his best receiver for a wide-open reception and instead throwing to a well-covered sophomore who replaced the injured redshirt junior Steven Mitchell Jr. in the starting lineup earlier in the season.
Of course, he was going for it all. And of course, the throw was perfect, right over the outstretched arm of Brown. By the time Allen entered the picture, Burnett already had the ball and a foot in the end zone.
“How does he make this throw with that coverage?” marveled Kirk Herbstreit on the ESPN telecast.
Burnett credited his chemistry with Darnold.
“Me and Sam are always having talks,” he said. “I see what I see and what he sees around the field.”
Ultimately, though, the decision rested with Darnold to look off his top receiver and go for the deep ball. He said Burnett was supposed to “keep a straight line” on the play instead of run a post route.
“But just the player that he is, he made a play, and I saw him,” Darnold said. “So I’m happy I threw it to him and not the shallow (receiver).”
With that, the game was tied, and the rest is history.
If the Washington upset was the moment Darnold became a legitimate quarterback, the Rose Bowl was the game that propelled him to Heisman Trophy frontrunner next season. He broke Vince Young’s bowl record for total yards (473), along with the record for touchdown passes (5). He threw for 453 yards, eclipsing former USC quarterback Mark Sanchez’s mark of 400 yards in the 2009 Rose Bowl. He finished the season with multiple touchdown passes in nine straight games; the last USC quarterback to do that was Matt Leinart. And he’s just 19 years old.
If Sam Darnold followed the script, he probably would have set none of those marks. If he didn’t consistently go for the home run over the safety valve, USC might not have even been in the Rose Bowl. If he didn’t have that quiet confidence, that calm demeanor, that sense to stay poised and deliver clutch throws on the biggest stage, then we’re definitely not talking “USC” and “national championship” in the same breath next season.
Quite frankly, USC let Darnold be Darnold this season, and it was probably the best decision that could’ve been made.
“Certain animals are born certain animals, and you can’t change it,” Martin said.
In an ESPN interview after the game, Darnold was asked how he inspired a sense of belief in his teammates.
“I think just staying poised. I’m never going to change for anyone,” he said. “That’s just who I am.”

I’m certain that I was just one of the thousands of people who were fervently refreshing junior Juju Smith-Schuster’s social media accounts Saturday afternoon in search of an answer to the question:
“One more year?”
When the standout receiver tweeted that a decision on his senior season would be announced in “a couple hours” Saturday, it was 3:19 p.m. 
With eyes glued to my smartphone, I rapidly began updating my Twitter feed at 5:19 p.m. Everybody knows that “a couple” entails two hours, right? Nope, still nothing from the receiver concerning his decision. 
Then, at exactly 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, Smith-Schuster dropped the bombshell on Twitter: He will forgo his senior season and declare for the 2017 NFL Draft.
Smith-Schuster’s announcement-tweet included a letter to the Trojan Family. In the letter, he said, “I have loved my time at USC and wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world. Playing for USC was truly a dream come true, and I am proud of what we were able to accomplish in three years.” He also noted that USC will always be a huge part of him and that he sees the program is in a position to compete for a national championship. 
Looking back, there’s no question that Smith-Schuster will go down as one of the greatest Trojan wideouts in USC history. 
Statistically, Smith-Schuster ranks fourth all-time in career receptions by a USC receiver (213); he also ranks fifth all-time in Trojan history in receiving yards (3,032) and touchdowns (25).
And within his bundle of impressive statistics, there are countless JuJu memories that will be replayed over and over in the minds of Trojan fans for years to come. 
We’ll never forget the time Smith-Schuster, in the open field, pointed out Utah defensive back Dominique Hatfield before viciously stiff-arming him to the Coliseum turf as USC upset the then-No. 3 ranked Utes. Or how about the time in 2015 when he reeled in eight catches for 138 yards and a touchdown against Arizona — all with a pretty-much-broken right hand. In 2016, Smith-Schuester had a pair of three-touchdown receiving performances against Arizona State (Oct. 1) and Arizona (Oct. 15).
In last week’s Rose Bowl Game against No. 5 Penn State, Smith-Schuster made the play that sparked the Trojans’ 17-0 run over the final 8:15 of regulation to defeat the Nittany Lions. Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold found Smith-Schuster streaking down the sideline for a 27-yard connection that put the Trojans at the Penn State 3-yard line before USC proceeded to punch in a crucial late-game score. The catch, which Smith-Schuster made with one arm, was initially ruled incomplete, but the call was overturned and the catch confirmed upon further review.
If you asked me what play got USC back into that Rose Bowl, I would tell you that this catch in the fourth quarter by Smith-Schuster is what catapulted the Trojans back into the game.
No doubt, Smith-Schuster’s receptions and clutch performances (seven catches, 133 yards and a touchdown in Pasadena last week) have landed him a permanent spot in Trojan football lore. But, now looking back pensively, I feel that one of Smith-Schuster’s most pivotal plays may have been one of the few times he didn’t catch the ball when targeted.
No matter how you look at USC’s season, one cannot deny that Sam Darnold was the golden boy for the Trojans this year. Without the emergence of Darnold, there was simply no hope for the Trojans to even dream of a Rose Bowl berth.
We’ve all heard the story a hundred times over now: USC gets off to an anemic start offensively this season; redshirt junior Max Browne out as quarterback; enter Darnold.
Now let’s take a look at the timing of the quarterback switch and the role Smith-Schuster played in installing Darnold as the Trojans’ permanent signal caller.
Browne was replaced by Darnold after the Trojans suffered a 27-10 loss to then-No. 7 Stanford in Week 3. On a third down play in the fourth quarter against the Cardinal, Browne targeted Smith-Schuster for what would be his final passing attempt as the Trojans’ starting quarterback.  
A solid throw from Browne failed to connect with Smith-Schuster in the end-zone. The receiver was tied up with a Stanford defender in the process of trying to make the catch; he failed to reel in the ball with his one available arm and the pass fell incomplete.
The ball hits the turf. It’s fourth down, and Browne trots off the field for the final time as USC’s starter. The failure to reel in that accurate dart to Smith-Schuster’s hands just may have saved the Trojans’ season.
If Smith-Schuster somehow found a way to catch that pass, the whole course of the 2016 campaign would have been altered in an unknown manner.
It would be hard to imagine the USC coaching staff making the switch that they did in Week 4 for Darnold had Browne connected with Smith-Schuster on that play, which would have been a 46-yard touchdown pass late in the Stanford game. If Smith-Schuster found a way to reel in the pass with one arm — as was nearly routine during his time as a Trojan — who knows how long Browne would have gone in the season as USC’s head signal-caller?
In retrospect, most can agree that head coach Clay Helton’s switch to Darnold was the turning point of the Trojans’ season. Without the incompletion to Smith-Schuster in the late stages of the Stanford game, we may have seen more of Browne this season, and less of Darnold at quarterback.
And as harsh as it may sound, the longer Browne stood in as USC quarterback, the lesser the likelihood was of the Trojans making a bowl game in 2016, let alone the Rose Bowl Game.
No Darnold, no Rose Bowl: that’s a statement every USC follower should be able to agree with.
As strange as it may sound, Smith-Schuster’s drop on a September night in Palo Alto may have been the birth pangs of the Sam Darnold era — and the commencement of USC’s Rose Bowl run.
And with that, the Trojan Family collectively should be saying, “Thank you for everything, Juju, even the drops.” Whether it was making one-handed catches that left us scratching our heads, delivering bone-crushing hits, playing with crushed bones or even “JuJu-ing on that beat” on a Thursday night against Cal, you always left us wanting more.

Cal (11-5, 2-2) visited the Galen Center on Sunday to take on the Trojans (15-2, 2-2), and the Pac-12 clash lived up to the pre-game hype. Forty minutes of tightly contested basketball kept getting better and better, as both teams got hot from beyond the arc and traded scores tit-for-tat until the very end.
Although USC had the final possession, Cal had the last laugh, leaving Los Angeles with its first road win, 74-73, versus an AP Top-25 team since November 2014. 
“It was a great college basketball game. Both teams played extremely hard,” head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. 
With 5.2 seconds left and the Trojans down by one, Enfield called a timeout. He drew up a play for junior guard Jordan McLaughlin to take the ball all the way upcourt.
The captain did just that, dribbling behind the back and splitting a double team to extend his drive past half-court. McLaughlin made it all the way under the basketball, but three Bears suddenly pounced on him, and Ivan Rabb got a clean block from behind. While Cal’s Jabari Bird’s jump made contact in front of McLaughlin, the referees deemed that he jumped straight up and didn’t blow the whistle. USC had dropped its first home game of the 2016-17 season. 
Final play aside, the Trojans lost Sunday’s game at the free-throw line, where they went a measly 10-of-21. McLaughlin, a 89 percent shooter at the stripe this season, sank 3 of 8 — including two misses with 45.3 seconds to play and the Trojans down by one. 
After he missed both free throws, the game looked over for the Trojans. However, junior guard Elijah Stewart stole the ball in Cal’s backcourt to set up another Trojan possession. McLaughlin attacked the rim, but Bird denied him, swatting the ball out of bounds. 
McLaughlin inbounded the ball to sophomore forward Chimezie Metu, who slipped but recovered in time to hand the ball back to the point guard for a lay-up on the far side of the bucket. The Trojans led by one with 14.1 seconds to play. 
Rabb, Cal’s AP Preseason All-American, had been double-teamed all night by a host of Trojans, but on the Bears’ final possession, he was alone with Metu. The towering sophomore fouled Rabb with 5.2 seconds to play, and the Cal star drilled both free throws — the game’s final points. 
Rabb finished 6-of-10 from the floor with 17 points and eight rebounds. He had picked up his fourth foul with over six minutes to play, but he played smart in the final minutes.
Despite the loss, the Trojans can take away many positives from the game. Metu, to his credit, matched Rabb throughout the game. 
“I knew it was going to be a battle coming in. I was just going to play a good 40 minutes,” Metu said about guarding the Bears’ power forward. 
Metu shot 9-of-15 from the floor, including a run of five consecutive makes. He dominated Cal’s seven-footer Kameron Rooks, who was playing his second game back from a knee surgery. Credit is also due to freshman forward Nick Rakocevic, who played 24 minutes, mostly without foul trouble. Rakocevic eventually drew four fouls after picking up two in the span of 30 seconds, but he held his own against Cal’s physical front court.
For grad transfer Charles Buggs, the frustration continued. USC’s sixth man picked up three fouls in quick succession, forcing Metu to stay on the court for 38 minutes. The Trojans sorely miss sophomore co-captain Benny Boatwright’s 6-foot-10 frame, to say the least. 
Meanwhile, Boatwright’s replacement starter, freshman DeAnthony Melton, continued to shine with his extra playing time. Melton logged his best game of the season, contributing 13 points, a team-high seven rebounds, four assists, two blocks and three steals over 34 minutes. A reticent shooter this season, Melton looked comfortable on Sunday, going 4-of-9 with a pair of 3-pointers. As a team, USC shot 7-of-12 from downtown.
The Trojans face a tough road trip next week in the altitude against Utah and Colorado.

Senior Morgan Andrews was recognized in the top echelon of women’s soccer players on Jan. 6 at the MAC Hermann Trophy banquet. After leading her team to a NCAA championship title, Andrews became the second Trojan athlete to be named as a MAC Hermann finalist.
The honor is equivalent to becoming a Heisman finalist in college football. At the start of the season, Andrews was selected for a watch list along with fellow senior Kayla Mills. After finishing the season as the team’s second-highest scorer, Andrews was placed in the top three players in the nation.
West Virginia senior Kadeisha Buchanan won the prestigious award, and Stanford senior Andi Sullivan was the third finalist for the award. Buchanan is a regular for the Canadian national team, earning the title of Canadian Women’s Player of the Year and a nomination for the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2015.
Andrews’ selection among this level of competition reflected the growing success of the USC program throughout her time in the program. After transferring from Notre Dame, Andrews became part of the core that led the team to a national championship this year. She scored 24 points and notched four assists on the season, scoring the first goal in the final game against West Virginia.
When she first received the nomination, Andrews was adamant that her goals had nothing to do with individual awards. She had one goal, she said — a national championship. Everything else was just a fun add-on.
But after securing that ultimate goal, this honor was the final touch on a rollercoaster of a senior year.
“It’s the greatest honor any collegiate soccer player can earn,” Andrews said after her nomination. “When you look at the people who have come before, who have won it in the past, it’s pretty incredible to even be considered on that level.”

USC’s football team was not the only one who battled it out with Penn State at the beginning of the new year. The men’s volleyball team travelled to Columbus, Ohio for the Big Ten/Pac-12 challenge and took on the Nittany Lions.
Unlike the Rose Bowl matchup last week, however, the Trojans fell to Penn State on Saturday, suffering a narrow five-set defeat.
From the start of the game, the battle was set to be a long and tough one, as the teams went on to tie 20 times throughout the first set. It took a kill and a Penn State hitting error to clinch USC’s win at 32-30, ending the back-and-forth set. Senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder led the charge with 10 of his career-high 33 kills in the first set alone.
The Trojans’ momentum would not continue into the second set though as they struggled with both serving and hitting errors. The Lions were able capitalize on the mistakes, and they surged ahead and finished the set quickly without the same back-and-forth required in the first.
But whatever head coach Jeff Nygaard said to the team in the locker room worked, because the Trojans returned to the court for the third set looking like the team that had started the game.
It began much like the first, with neither team pulling away with the lead, battling for each and every point. It was Penn State that struggled with hitting errors this time, however, which allowed USC to pull ahead and ultimately win the set. 
The Trojans were ahead 2-1 and only needed one more set to win it all. Though junior setter Gert Lisha set excellently throughout the match, leading to his total of 57 assists, and Yoder provided strength on the outside, Penn State still rallied back from being down early to take the set, 25-23. This forced a fifth frame that would leave the Trojans with a defeat.
In the end, Penn State had more digs, blocks and service aces than the Trojans. This was seen most clearly in the final set, where the Trojans never regained the lead after the first point. This was due to the Lions’ redshirt freshmen Calvin Mende, who notched 25 kills and five blocks on the game, and senior Chris Nugent’s 22 kills.
USC showed its ability to be aggressive and make the plays that were needed, but not the consistency that would have led it to victory. However, with the increasing strength of freshmen opposite hitter Aaron Strange and Yoder’s unwavering power, the Trojans look to build on the positives in the coming weeks.
The men’s volleyball team looks to move to 2-2 as it takes on Long Beach State at the Galen Center on Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Former USC quarterback Matt Leinart was named to the College Football Hall of Fame Monday, making the three-time All-American the 43rd Trojan to receive the honor. Leinart was a focal point of USC’s early-2000s dynasty under Pete Carroll and led the program to two national championships, winning the 2004 Heisman Trophy in the process.
He captained the Trojans for two years and racked up 99 career touchdowns and more than 10,000 passing yards. USC went 37-2 when Leinart started under center, and he was named MVP of the Rose Bowl (2004) and Orange Bowl (2005) during his time at Troy. In his Heisman-winning campaign, Leinart also won the Walter Camp Player of the Year, AP Player of the Year and Manning awards — and he took home the Unitas Golden Arm Award and Pop Warner Award in 2005.
As his trophy cabinet reflects, Leinart set numerous records throughout his three years at USC, including 16 program marks and two NCAA records.
He was inducted into the USC Hall of Fame in 2007 and named to the Pac-12 All-Century Team in 2015.
After his Trojan career, Leinart was drafted in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft and spent seven seasons at the professional level. He now works as a college football analyst for Fox Sports.
Leinart was selected alongside 12 other Hall of Fame inductees this year (nine players), including decorated head coach Steve Spurrier, as well as former Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning, Georgia Southern tailback Adrian Peterson and New Mexico’s Brian Urlacher.
Leinart’s entry into the Hall of Fame establishes his legacy in the history of college football. He joins many fellow Trojans in the halls in Atlanta, including current Athletic Director Lynn Swann and Heisman winner O.J. Simpson.
Leinart joined the other members of the 2017 Hall of Fame class for an induction ceremony in New York City on Dec. 5. Following the event, he thanked his coaches, fans and teammates for their support and commitment throughout his four years as a Trojan.
“Everything I achieved in college was solely because I had the greatest teammates in the world,” Leinart wrote in an Instagram post.

This past weekend proved to be a difficult one for the Women of Troy, as the women’s basketball team traveled to the state of Washington only to drop two straight to Washington and Washington State. USC now stands at 10-5 with a subpar 1-3 record in conference play. 
“You never want to start conference this way,” senior guard Courtney Jaco said. “We wish we could have gotten a couple more wins, but we’re growing everyday and learning a little bit about ourselves.” 
USC’s road trip began on Friday in Seattle against No. 11 Washington. Despite an excellent performance from freshman guard Minyon Moore (18 points) and a major fourth quarter comeback spurred by Jaco (16 second-half points), the Huskies ultimately prevailed 77-67. Washington rode on the back of senior guard Kelsey Plum, a San Diego native, whose 34 points, five assists and five rebounds were instrumental in the team’s success. The 15-2 Huskies led for the entirety of the game. 
The Women of Troy searched for a more successful outing on Sunday, as they faced off against 8-8 Washington State in Pullman. Instead, they experienced a starkly uneven performance. Ending the first half with a 35-34 lead, USC scored just 22 second half points and went as long as four and a half minutes without scoring in the third quarter. The Cougars capitalized on USC’s offensive ineptitude on their way to a 74-57 win.
“I just think we weren’t moving the ball well and sharing the ball like we were in the first half,” Jaco said, explaining her team’s second half struggles. “We found Kristen [Simon] a lot down low, and I think we got away from that coming out for the second half.” 
For standout junior forward Simon, it was a bittersweet game. On one hand, her team ended up with a dispiriting 17-point loss to a mid-tier conference foe. On the other, she set a new career high in points (25) to go along with nine rebounds, all while being hobbled with a recent ankle injury. 
“[Simon] was our motor the whole game,” Jaco said. “If it wasn’t for her, I don’t really know what we would have done. Honestly it was surprising because she sprained her ankle really badly on Friday so we didn’t know whether she was going to play or not. She came out and gave that performance and gave that fight and kind of inspired us.” 
USC was unable to find any consistent offense outside of Simon. No other starter scored more than 3 points, and overall, the junior accounted for more than 40 percent of her team’s total scoring output. One positive, however, was Ivana Jakubcova, the 6-foot-6 transfer from Kentucky who showed off her range with two late 3-pointers. She finished with a second-best nine points. 
The Women of Troy will have a few days to try to correct some of the offensive issues that plagued them over the weekend. This week, they host a dangerous Oregon team (11-5) on Friday and then No. 16 Oregon State on Sunday. The Beavers are undefeated so far in conference play and sit at 15-1 overall. 
“Hopeful,” Jaco said, describing the team’s mood after losing three straight conference games. “We’re still in the beginning of Pac-12 [play], so thankfully we have a lot more games to a go — a lot more basketball to be played. We’re just looking forward to the next opportunity.”
