The Department of Economics hosted a symposium at Taper Hall Tuesday evening to discuss GAFAM — the five Big Tech companies dominating the market: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft — and the role of antitrust law in the industry. 
Leading experts from a variety of industries spoke at the event, including Fabien Curto Millet, director of economics at Google; Brijesh Pinto, assistant professor of economics of the practice of economics at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences; Ziyi Qiu, adjunct professor of law and adjunct assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Daniel Sokol, Carolyn Craig Franklin Chair in Law at the Gould School of Law and affiliate professor of business at the Marshall School of Business. Abraham Solovy, student -alumni liaison and former vice president of the Economics Association, moderated the event.
Panelists first discussed the areas in digital platform competition and regulation that require rethinking.
“There are two dimensions along which to think about this,” Sokol said. “The first thing is: What are the goals of antitrust? [Second thing:] What should the standard of evaluation be — consumer welfare or something else? I think there’s a little regulatory uncertainty about that.”
Pinto said he does not necessarily view the current situation as “a race between regulators and firms,” instead laying the responsibility on an “academic gap issue.”
“How do we think about things like the complexity of transactions you see in tech? How do you think about data and how it should be valued? There’s almost a sort of barter-like system, where you’re exchanging service for data,” Pinto said. “This discussion we’re having today is a bit of the microcosm of the conversation that we need to have with stakeholders from academia, industry and also [federal] agencies.”
Sokol said the pattern of the two-sided market — which he credited as conceptualized by 19th-century Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk — was not new, but rather appearing and reappearing through the years under different names. What is new, however, is the emergence of data as a driving force for monopoly.
“We’re getting all kinds of data. Data in many ways has become like carbon dioxide: We breathe it in, we breathe it out,” Sokol said. “The concern is few-fold: Number one, from an antitrust perspective, the concern is that the law has become too lenient to larger firms. Number two, the concern is maybe we focus too much on static effects, not dynamic effects. Number three, we are concerned that these cases go on for too long.”
Solovy also asked panelists to compare digital platform regulation with that of traditional industries, and to discuss the lessons to be learned from the latter.
“Digital platform is an industry that is very sensitive to innovation,” Qiu said. “Even for firms that are competing today, you will see [they carry] different business models, and their business model is not stable. It’s changing. It’s evolving over time.”
Millet, from Google, said that despite narratives that antitrust efforts have thus far failed, regulation remains important.
“We need regulation,” Millet said. “I mean, the regulation is now around the corner. And I do not want to contest this kind of move order. Societies decide how these things go. And us in private companies, we are here to ensure compliance, really, with the frameworks that are imposed upon us. But nevertheless, the justification towards regulation does raise some questions in my mind.”

Student Health will continue its weekly naloxone distribution program, bolstered by the Federal Drug Administration’s advisory panel recommendation that NARCAN be made available over the counter, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday.
Last week, two panels of advisors to the FDA recommended that NARCAN — the most well-known brand under which naloxone is sold — be made widely available without a prescription, increasing the likelihood that the FDA will approve an over-the-counter version of naloxone. The recommendation comes just as Student Health revived their annual naloxone distribution program, NaloxoneSC, which takes place weekly at the Trojan Farmers Market on Wednesdays now through April 5.
“We certainly support that,” Van Orman said. “If it’s over-the-counter, in my perspective, that’s just removing one more barrier.”
NARCAN use has become more commonplace with the worsening of the nation’s overdose crisis. Currently, California laws allow pharmacists to dispense NARCAN under a standing prescription to entire programs, as well as individuals.
At present, students can request NARCAN from a University pharmacist, who will first provide the student with necessary education and training related to the drug. If the FDA made NARCAN available without prescription, the process would become even simpler, Van Orman said.
“It would further expand access,” Van Orman said. “It would remove the requirement for the education, although we certainly support the education as well … So in my mind, the more we can get the word out, and the more ways and opportunities that people, not just students, can get access to it and understand the importance, the better.”
Even if NARCAN were to become more readily available at pharmacies across California, Van Orman said, Student Health’s distribution program would still provide added benefit. 
“We know that [for] some people for example, even the idea of going into a pharmacy, where they still require providing an ID, your name, your information — that can still be a barrier,” Van Orman said.
Beyond simply distributing the drug, Van Orman said that raising awareness is also a significant goal of the program.
“I think it’s a great move, but there still will be a need for distribution programs, for education programs, for awareness programs,” Van Orman said. “But again, it’s really all about lowering barriers in whatever way we can lower barriers.”
Campus coronavirus cases are holding steady, with 61 new cases recorded last week. Van Orman warned that though the initial influenza outbreak ended in December, there is a high likelihood that a second wave could occur in the spring.
“[I’m] just encouraging people to keep washing their hands, covering their coughs, staying home when they’re sick, and testing themselves for [the coronavirus],” Van Orman said.

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed reallocations within the programming and funding department at Tuesday night’s senate meeting. 
Chief programming officer Jillian Fallon said the Budget Allocation Committee reallocates funding by determining how each assembly and committee were spending their budgets throughout the year, and assessing whether they were on track to spend that budget.
“We went line by line for every single assembly and committee and that was how we came to the decision,” Fallon said. “The projected spending for the semester was [too high and] not on par with the plans that were projected from the previous year, which is why we’ve made the decision to reallocate.”
Among the organizations facing funding cuts was the Transfer Student Assembly, which lost $2,000 — almost one-fifth of its fiscal year 2023 budget of $15,000. TSA co-director Sophia Tabares said this has a larger impact than cuts to other organizations that have larger budget allocations.
“A lot of [transfer] students don’t understand what resources there are because there is no real orientation for transfer students,” said Eric Abnoosian, assistant director of TSA. “If you guys do take this money away from us, we’re not able to have events to help show transfer students the resources that they have on campus.”
In addition to the TSA’s cuts, $42,000 from the Philanthropy Fund (53% of its FY23 budget), $4,05,500 from the Political Student Assembly (18% of its budget), $6,000 from the Service Student Assembly (60% of its budget), $6,000 from the Special Events Committee (15% of its budget) and $2,000 from the Student Assembly for Accessibility (18% of its budget) will be reallocated.
As of Tuesday’s meeting, $10,000 is to be reallocated to the Joint Assembly for Military-Associated Students (a 200% increase from FY23), $10,000 to the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly (a 200% increase), $7,000 to the Performing and Visual Arts Fund (an 8% increase), $7,000 the Professional and Academic Research Funds (an 8% increase) and $28,000 the Social & Recreation and Startup Funds (a 32% increase).
The Senate approved the budget reallocation in a roll vote of 10-2. The Senate also unanimously approved a bill to initiate a trial period for the First Generation Student Assembly. 
Following the votes, vice president Nivea Krishnan gave a recap of the Senate’s administrative roundtable held Feb. 10. USC Hospitality is in partnership with Homeboy Industries, a hallmark organization that works with former gang members to integrate them back into society, by providing employment opportunities. USC Hospitality is also working to donate extra food from the dining halls, Krishnan said.
Krishnan has been working on a project that would increase discussions regarding civil discourse on campus. For example, Krishnan said that the recent Supreme Court cases about race-conscious admissions directly impact the University.
“I think there’s this assumption that our peers are too smart,” Krishnan said. “They understand all the nuances of some really complex policy conversations, … but that makes kids afraid to have conversations [since they’re] afraid of getting canceled or seeing some investment may be a little bit not completely accurate. [Instead], they should have room to kind of talk about things and try to get to be more informed.”
Chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias said he has been working to prepare for Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April. USG partnered with Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services to increase engagement for students. USG approved $200 of legislative funding to raffle 10 $20 gift cards as an incentive for students to attend RSVP events. 
USG is also partnering with the National Alliance on Mental Illness to raise $2,000 at USC and $15,000 nationally for suicide prevention by hosting a campus Hope Walk which will be held April 4. 
Diaz-Arias currently sits on the Campus Violence Prevention Collective, a coalition of USC student leaders and administrators initially formed by RSVP to engage in conversations regarding gender- and power-based harm, campus-wide initiatives and prevention efforts on campus. 
“It’s a space [where] we can talk about different campus issues and the culture surrounding campus,” Diaz-Arias said. 
Senator Divya Jakatdar presented project updates such as the LiveSafe app, a public safety app in collaboration with RSVP and the Department of Public Safety to add features to and clarify centralized resources for reporting sexual violence. 
Other projects that Jakatdar has been working on include providing undocumented students resources to obtain red cards, which they would be able to present to government officials if questioned, and creating medical supplies vending machines for students to have access to medical supplies at a discounted rate, which is planned to be available at the end of Spring 2023.

Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of “The 1619 Project,” spoke at USC Tuesday as part of the Charlotta Bass Media Trailblazer Speaker Series. The event was co-hosted by USC Visions & Voices and the USC Annenberg Charlotta Bass Journalism and Justice Lab. The event took place at 6 p.m. at Bovard Auditorium and included a brief Q&A period with three student fellows. Allissa Richardson, associate professor of journalism and communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and founder of the Charlotta Bass Lab, moderated the event. 
Before the discussion with Hannah-Jones, the audience viewed a short trailer from the Hulu original series “The 1619 Project.” The six episode docuseries began as a pitch to adopt a Sunday edition of The New York Times that planned to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved people’s arrival in America. Following the issue, “The 1619 Project” evolved to include a novel, consisting of a collection of essays featuring Black scholars, touching on topics from healthcare to democracy and highlighting the legacy of slavery and how it has shaped modern institutions.
The evening opened with a performance by the SoCal VoCals of “A Change Is Gonna Come” by Sam Cooke, followed by a speech by President Carol Folt. Darnella Frazier, who recorded George Floyd’s murder in May 2020, was also slated to attend the event but could not make it at the last minute. 
President Folt spoke about the legacy of Charlotta Bass, the first Black woman to own a newspaper, and commended the Lab for leading the effort to make Feb. 14 Charlotta Bass Day in Los Angeles. She also said that USC will not join the campaign to restrict and remove Black history curricula around the United States, a statement that was met with applause. 
Richardson asked Hannah-Jones about her experience growing up in Waterloo, Iowa, in a multiracial household, at a time when Black students were being bussed to schools in white areas, and how that experience inspired her to spearhead “The 1619 Project.” Hannah-Jones spoke about her favorite teacher, Ray Dial, who taught a Black history elective when she was in high school, and how his class was what ultimately led to her becoming a journalist who writes about Black issues. Hannah-Jones also spoke about how she had to work up to pitching “The 1619 Project” to The New York Times editorial board, having to prove that it was a worthy topic to be in the magazine. 
In the last few minutes of the event, Hannah-Jones took questions from student fellows. Rafiq Taylor, a graduate student studying public relations and advertising and fellow at the Charlotta Bass Journalism and Justice lab, opened the questions. He asked Hannah-Jones about fear of facing the past and reaching audiences that are unwilling to reckon with America’s history. 
“In formulating my question, I was thinking as a fan of history and thinking about how today’s world is not so different from the past world because the conversation around Black liberation has always been happening,” Taylor said. “It’s just a matter of who gets to control that conversation, so I was wondering, what [Hannah-Jones’] take would be on the fear of facing that reality.”
Following Taylor’s question, Jen Byers, a graduate student studying specialized journalism, asked how to handle backlash and personal attacks when covering controversial topics or exposing corruption. 
“I’m actually working on an investigation about this corruption situation … but I have been facing some pretty severe harassment from the person I am attempting to hold accountable,” Byers said. “I just knew that whatever answer [Hannah-Jones gave] — which was, ‘Fight them and don’t back down, and know that their insults are attempting to make you small” — would be good advice and I’m really grateful for it.’” 
The event was initially supposed to take place in The Forum at Annenberg Hall, but Richardson said she elected to move it to Bovard because of security concerns. 
There are “about eight different ways you can come in [to the Forum],” Richardson told the Daily Trojan in an interview. “I made the decision to close it off.” 
Because Richardson elected to hold the event in Bovard, however, many more people were able to attend. Richardson said the event was capped at 2,000 RSVPs because the auditorium could only seat 1,400 people. 
Professor Richardson said she was happy with how the event transpired. 
“I knew that at some point you have to still be an interviewer, but I was really caught up in listening to the answers,” Richardson said. “It was a real treat as a professor just gobbling up all the knowledge and sticking pins in things I’d like to read more about.” 
Hannah-Jones told the Daily Trojan that she was excited to come and speak at USC for the event. 
“I think the lab that Dr. Richardson just launched is so important,” Hannah-Jones said. “It so aligns with the work that I’m doing both as a journalist and as a professor and as someone in the field who tries to train and mentor and uplift the voices of Black journalists.” 
Hannah-Jones also expressed her gratitude for the crowd that had assembled to hear her speak, especially as a reprieve from the harsh criticism and threats for her work she regularly faces from others.
“Sometimes it’s easy to focus on people who are attacking the work or disparaging the work,” Hannah-Jones said. “Then you come into a space like this and are reminded of what the work means to so many people.”

Tawanda Wise was depositing groceries into the South Hill community fridge one morning when she met Lisa Derinsicky, an advocate for unhoused people who coordinates the collection of supplies and oversees upkeep of the fridge. Derinsicky eventually invited Wise to an event she had helped organize: a community cookout featuring free food, clothes and personal protective equipment to support the local unhoused community.
The Mardi Gras cookout featured the collective effort of USC student organizations such as AyuDirect, which uses Instagram to pair unhoused people with supplies donated from the local community, and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, which advocates for workers’ rights, along with local community members which Derinsicky had built relationships with over time in the South Central community.
Sandra Hernandez, a designer for the local clothing brand UTZ’ALI, met Derinsicky during her time at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College, where she graduated from in 1991. To Hernandez, an important aspect of UTZ’ALI’s mission is giving back to the community. Hernandez came to the cookout with her niece, husband, sister and other family members along with coworkers from UTZ’ALI, bringing clothes, toys, shoes and bag lunches to the event. 
In addition to the supplies which UTZ’ALI contributed, a GoFundMe page created by AyuDirect raised $290 to help pay for supplies, and USC SCALE collected more clothes, food and personal protective equipment to provide for the event. 
“These are all friend-based commitments,” Derinsicky said. “The word of mouth for unity within our community really is a successful thing.” 
Wise arrived at the cookout at 9 a.m. and helped Lisa with gathering supplies throughout the day. Later in the day, Maria Rodrigues arrived with her daughter Francia Oxlaj, wheeling in a cart with a griddle on top.
As a hot dog vendor, Rodrigues usually sells hot dogs at events to provide for her family, but during the cookout she provided steaming hot dogs topped with grilled onions and bell peppers free of charge. For Rodrigues and Oxlaj, the support that Derinsicky and other community members provided was crucial in helping them adjust when they moved to the Los Angeles area in 2021, and providing free hot dogs was a way of giving back to the community.
Grilling burgers at the edge of the cookout was Dominic Jocas, the founder of AyuDirect and a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. Jocas met Derinsicky at the community fridge one day and was instrumental in helping Jocas connect with other organizations from USC and beyond that address homelessness. Jocas founded AyuDirect in January 2022 as a way of getting USC students more involved in the local community.
“Everybody in the USC community, they’re very isolated in the bubble and they don’t see themselves as South Central residents,” Jocas said. “[There are] these really amazing people … I just wish I could share that with other people.” 
Rather than donating clothes and supplies to large clothing drives, Jocas said donating through AyuDirect allows a person to know exactly who their supplies are going to and what their story is.
Over 41,900 people experienced homelessness in the city of L.A. in 2022, according to a report released by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. To address this, the city of L.A. typically engages in “street sweeps” to dismantle and streetside shelters and disperse unhoused people. Currently, due to Los Angeles Municipal Code 41.18, it is illegal to sit, sleep, or make encampments near overpasses, public libraries, schools and daycares, among other locations.
To combat the shrinking of the unhoused community in the area, the Mardi Gras cookout took place further down the street from the South Hill Community Fridge, where it was located during past cookouts, to reach new people.
“Right now I was able to get some of my friends from 33rd and 32nd street to come. And they told me that on Tuesday, they’re gonna get cleared out,” Derinsicky said. “There’s no more extensions, they’re gonna get cleared out. Where are those people gonna go?”
As someone who is currently experiencing homelessness, Derinsicky faced pressure and threats from the city to relocate her trailer in August. Fortunately, a GoFundMe page through AyuDirect created to support Derinsicky raised over $4,600, surpassing its initial goal of $3,000, to secure a motor home for Derinsicky, her two dogs and other members of her animal family where she could continue living. 
For the support that USC students have provided, Derinsicky gave “the biggest thank you possible.” 
“Each and every one of them is a powerhouse, every single one.” Derinsicky said. “When you get a whole bunch of powerhouses united, it’s an immeasurable success.”

It’s a familiar story for queer students at USC: escaping the hetero-monotony of our homes. We moved to USC with a vision of freedom of expression and close proximity to the queer culture to which Los Angeles is home. We were sold inclusive promises by highly effective propaganda geared towards newly admitted students, and given a chance to move to a diverse, prestigious university, we bought it. But is the University living up to its own messaging?
In my first semester at USC, I resolved to attend LGBTQIA+ events and make more queer friends, and, in large part, I was happy to find plenty of programming through resources like the LGBTQ+ Student Center and QuASA, the Queer and Ally Student Assembly. Yet, after my first semester at USC, I caught myself thinking: Is this it? It’s not that there weren’t events to attend — but rather than feeling more integrated into the community, I found myself showing up with the other queer friends I already knew, doing the activities in our own group, and leaving without much more than casual conversation with other attendees.
I’m not isolated in feeling this way; I frequently hear from peers that organizations such as these feel like impossible niches to break into. If you aren’t part of the institutionalized, formal queer community from the very beginning, you might not get very far, even if you are technically allowed to show up. Worse, LGBTQIA+ spaces at USC tend to be oversaturated with socioeconomically privileged queer students. This not only leaves out queer students with other marginalized identities but deprives them of the resources they would benefit from the most.
I looked to the Campus Pride Index for some clues as to how we got here (ironically, I remember perusing this site when choosing where to attend college). According to the site, the index “is an overall indicator of institutional commitment to LGBTQIA+-inclusive policy, program, and practice.” 
While USC scored a four out of five, the index noted that it failed to “actively recruit faculty for LGBTQIA+-related academic scholarship,” provide training on gender identity and sexual orientation to new faculty members, or have a standing advisory committee that deals with LGBTQIA+ issues. For comparison, UCLA scored a four and a half, and fulfilled each of those mentioned categories. Indeed, despite both universities being situated in one of the most historically LGBTQIA+-populous and culturally rich regions in the nation, it’s only UCLA that has an academic institute dedicated solely to researching public policy on gender identity and sexual orientation issues. Meanwhile, despite USC being home to the ONE Archives — the largest collection of LGBTQIA+ materials in the world — it appears to make insufficient effort to publicize it or make it accessible.
Beyond academic life, USC scores deceptively high on measures of institutional support, such as having a “resource center/office with responsibilities for LGBTQ students” (ostensibly the LGBTQ+ Student Center). Though the center is an invaluable resource, little physical space at USC is actually committed to queer students. The LGBTQ+ Student Center, a beautiful space dedicated to providing resources and gathering community, is not only disappointingly small but is also inconveniently stowed away on the fourth floor of the Student Union. As a new student unfamiliar with the building, it would be easy to miss the center’s location, and like many of the other cultural centers, LGBTQ+ Student Center’s capacity to host programming is limited by its size.
In a more pressing manifestation of under-dedicating space to LGBTQ+ students, the University Park campus still has only two buildings with gender-neutral, multi-stall bathrooms — the same number previously reported by the Daily Trojan in 2016. Additionally, only 67 of the 274 buildings have any gender-neutral bathrooms, single or multi-stall. How is it that despite years of student advocacy and promises from the school, this vital component of LGBTQIA+ inclusivity has made almost no progress?
The University strives to be a leader among higher education institutions in equity and inclusion, and students like myself flock to Los Angeles to benefit from USC’s academic and social riches. As young queer adults who have made it thus far, we can, and should, always demand more. The reality both students and the administration must face is that it’s not enough to have pride flags plastered around the campus during LGBTQIA+ history month. Until true institutional academic support and useful physical space are dedicated to us, and until we as students collectively know to demand it, LGBTQIA+ students will always struggle to have a presence in this campus community. Without presence, we can’t even begin to tackle the issues of inclusion within the LGBTQIA+ community itself.

Besides removing the bruising clamp of ski boots at the end of the day, one of the most classic traditions of skiing and snowboarding is Après. Formally known as Après-Ski, Après is a beloved afternoon pastime that draws crowds to a base lodge to dance and drink until dark. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love, love, LOVE skiing. This semester, I’ve gone up to Mammoth almost every weekend. But, I had my qualms about Après. 
Walking almost a mile both ways on ice in the dark didn’t seem terribly appealing. Plus, I enjoyed the long, steamy showers I had while everyone else went out. It was peaceful. Après seemed … chaotic. 
Sometimes, though, I wondered what it would be like to go, as I had never tried. At Mammoth, it was always “Let’s go to Après!” or “Are you coming to Après?” or “You should come to Après!” 
Time and time again, I brought up excuses for why I couldn’t go — “I’m pretty tired.” (The night was young.) “I’ve got work to do.” (It wasn’t that much.) “I’ll go next time.” (I wouldn’t.)
But, the first weekend of February, I made a decision: I would go to Après. Probably not the most well-thought-out decision I’ve ever made tbh. But I guess being nauseous in the backseat of a car climbing through winding switchbacks on a Thursday evening brings a certain kind of clarity (or impulsivity). 
The next day, someone asked if I was going. “Sure!” I replied. Though I knew my carefree air still came as a surprise. I sounded so … light. Fun. Lively.
That weekend changed my life.
Canyon was truly a scene to behold. Flashy jackets, string lights and pitties reflected every version of ROYGBIV possible. All around, people swayed and pulsed to the thumping bass of “Summertime Sadness” and “Mr. Brightside.” Before I knew it, there I was. In the crowd. Dancing. Beaming. Laughing. Without a care in the world, I shouted the chorus of GAYLE’S “abcdefu” with my teammates. And that’s all there was. I didn’t care. For the first time in my life, I wasn’t thinking about the work I had to do. I wasn’t overanalyzing my mistakes. I wasn’t paralyzed by anxious thoughts of how others might perceive me.
In the natural blur of a mosh and its habits, I turned to Nick, a fellow skier. Honestly, what happened next is still unreal. “Crowd surf?!” he shouted. “What?!” I replied, smiling. And just like that, I was in the air. Moving through the crowd. Floating. 
I wasn’t just surviving. Finally, I was living.
Eventually, I passed to the other side of the crowd, where a kind man helped me on top of a chair. 
“Crowd surfing? You’re crazy!” He laughed. I shrugged my shoulders. “College!” 
I joined the team back on the ground a little while later. When I think back on it, that whole weekend is tinted golden yellow in my mind. It was the first time in a while that I had felt genuinely happy. At last, I was free. 
Crossing chasms can seem challenging. But small things, like crowd surfing, are reminders of life’s simplicity. 
As I reflect on my identity as a Korean American and the diverse community in which I live, there’s a lesson to be learned here. Time and time again, minority and ethnic groups have been pitted against each other in American history. Our differences have been mined. Emphasized. Manipulated. Rather than supporting one another and uniting against common adversaries like inequality, division has “othered” allies and crippled entire communities.
This all melted away during Après. In any crowd, people gather to enjoy the music and share a common experience, regardless of their race, ethnicity or background. With Après, skiers and snowboarders come to relax and unwind after a go-go-go day on the mountain. 
Crowd surfing requires trust and cooperation between people. The surfer has to trust that the crowd will support and carry them safely, and judge the benefits of crowd surfing to be greater than the risk of being dropped. At Après, trust, music and people work together to transcend cultural and language barriers. 
Members of the crowd not only “understand” and support the surfer’s decision, they also “under-stand” — standing under the surfer to support them through the process. Crowd members may not even know themselves what crowd surfing is like. They may be of different ethnicities. Socioeconomic backgrounds. Ages. Career fields. MBTI personalities. Still, together, they lift up the surfer.
Now, I’m not saying crowd surfing is the answer to bridging racial divides by any means — though I wish life were that easy. However, it surpasses differences to unite people in a community towards a common cause.
At our core, we are all human beings who share common experiences and desires. In coming together and supporting one another, we can tackle any obstacle.
So take that leap. Get comfortable with the uncomfortable. Those forearms are stronger than you think. And the human spirit is more resilient than you know.

Thomas Müller will be remembered as one of the most confusingly great players of all time. 
He can’t finish like Cristiano Ronaldo, he can’t dribble like Lionel Messi and he can’t pass like Toni Kroos. Yet, he’s one of the most successful players of his generation. 
Müller has earned his living on timing and spatial awareness. He’s never been the most technical or fastest player on the pitch, but he always makes the right decision — it’s the reason he has 141 goals and 157 assists in his Bundesliga career. And at 33 years old, his retirement looms. 
But Bayern Munich fans have no need to worry. They already have their heir to Thomas Müller. His name is Jamal Musiala. 
In the 88th minute of a 3-1 win over SC Freiburg in the 2019-20 season, Musiala trotted onto the pitch to make his Bayern debut, and at the time becoming the club’s youngest-ever player at 17 years and 115 days old.
While Musiala did not make any further appearances that year, he quickly became a key player in the squad in 2020-21. He appeared 26 times in that campaign, including 7 starts and 7 goal contributions. His role grew even further last year, as he played over 1,000 minutes for the first time and tallied 10 goals and assists combined.
Now, in 2022-23, Musiala has become a bona fide star — the kind of star who has his own GQ 10 Essentials video. He starts week-in, week-out for Bayern and appears regularly for the German national team, starting all three 2022 World Cup matches. The young star doesn’t turn 20 for another four days and Bayern Munich can’t afford to drop him. 
Musiala lacks any glaring weakness and he affects the game from every area of the pitch. He can progress the ball through midfield, into the final third and also use his end-product to contribute goals and assists. Not only does Musiala possess the full attacking toolkit, he is a willing presser and defender as well.
According to FBref, Musiala averages 1.6 tackles per game, 1.17 blocks and exactly 1 interception. While those numbers sound small, for a player who spends most of his time as a winger or attacking midfielder, he ranks quite highly among his positional peers in Europe. His interceptions average is in the 96th percentile for comparable attackers. The mere fact that he blocks about a shot per match shows how committed he is to defense.
In attack, Musiala’s ball control elevates him among most other young attackers. The ball simply sticks to his feet. When the young German collects the ball in a crowded field, Musiala can slalom with confidence around defenders to create space for himself. His skill shows up in the numbers, too, with 2.49 successful take-ons per match — meaning he dribbles past more than two players most games.
The way Musiala can contort his long body makes him an especially dangerous dribbler. At a full 6 feet, Musiala is on the tall side for a skillful attacker. For comparison’s sake, Kylian Mbappé is 5-foot-10. When Musiala stretches his legs while dribbling, most players that tall would find it hard to retain possession, but Musiala does so with ease, allowing him to feint defenders dramatically and pull off audacious moves. 
This season, Musiala has added goals and assists to his game at a blistering rate. In 20 Bundesliga appearances (17 starts), Musiala has 10 goals and 7 assists. More importantly, his underlying numbers suggest it’s sustainable. He posts 0.62 non-penalty expected goals and expected assists per number, meaning he takes shots and makes passes into positions where the player has a high probability of scoring. His decision-making has a maturity that belies his age.
If Musiala manages to stay healthy and in-form for the foreseeable future, he could surpass Müller in all-time totals in a Bayern uniform with ease. Except, therein lies an issue.
Is staying at Bayern the best thing for Musiala? That sounds like a ridiculous question. Bayern has won 10 straight Bundesliga titles and will probably win their 11th this season. They’re one of just a handful of teams that competes semi-regularly for the Champions League, having won the tournament twice in the last 10 years. They always have an excellent squad and a high-caliber manager. 
Yet, to reach the pinnacle of the game — the apex at which players win both trophies and individual awards — he probably has to leave the Bundesliga. A player in the German league hasn’t won a Ballon d’Or since Borussia Dortmund’s Matthias Sammer in 1996. Bayern’s dominance has diminished the league in the public’s eyes; most fans don’t associate the Bundesliga with the world’s absolute best players. If he were to transfer to Real Madrid or Manchester City, Musiala would better position himself to eventually claim the title of world’s best player. 
Musiala has the talent to win multiple Ballon d’Or trophies. Whether or not he does may depend on him leaving the Bundesliga.

After cracking the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2016, USC faced off against Stanford and UC Berkeley in physical affairs that saw both opponents narrowly escape with 3-point victories over the Trojans. The Cardinal’s staunch defense proved the winning formula on Friday in their 50-47 victory, while the Golden Bears’ late-game heroics in overtime helped them edge out the Trojans 81-78. 
The No. 3-ranked Cardinal were 14-point favorites coming into Friday’s matchup. This was partly due to a torso injury suffered by star sophomore forward Rayah Marshall in USC’s previous game against Oregon State, which forced her to sit out. This clearly impacted the offensive prowess of the Trojans, who shot just 22% from the field. 
The inability to score the ball can also be attributed to USC’s difficulties scoring in the paint. The Trojans only had one bucket come from down low, which forced them to settle for difficult jump shots. 
When asked about their struggles scoring inside, Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb had a straightforward answer. 
“They’re gigantic,” Gottlieb said. “They were clearly trying to take away the paint in numerous ways.” 
Stanford junior forward Cameron Brink showcased why she is ranked second in the country in blocks, racking up 6 for the Cardinal. 
“Any chance I got, I tried to attack and, you know, [Brink] was there,” said graduate guard Destiny Littleton. “She’s huge and she’s a really good defender.” 
The pesky Trojans’ defense, combined with some clutch offensive rebounds late in the fourth, was able to cut Stanford’s lead to 3 points with 1:40 remaining in the fourth quarter. A last-ditch inbounds play with 2.7 seconds remaining for the Trojans saw Littleton launch a desperation 3-point shot, which fell short of its mark and sealed the loss for USC.  
“We were trying to get the ball out… but it just wasn’t there. So, you know, at the end of day, you just got to get a shot up,” Littleton said. “We didn’t want to get a clock violation or a turnover and just try to get a shot up.”
Although USC did not pull off the upset, Gottlieb was happy with how her team played. 
“I’m really proud of the way this team fights. I think it’s become part of our identity. It wasn’t pretty,” Gottlieb said. “We obviously want to make more shots, but we keep ourselves in games because of the character and who we are.”
USC followed up their loss with a trip north to play the California Golden Bears on Sunday. This game was extra special for Head Coach Gottlieb, who led Cal to their first Final Four appearance in school history a decade prior. 
This game also saw Marshall return to the starting lineup after missing Friday’s matchup against Stanford. She provided a strong contribution of 14 points and 9 rebounds. 
“It feels great to play with Rayah,” said graduate forward Kadi Sissoko. “We missed her a lot against Stanford, so it’s always a good thing to have all of our players back.”
The offense was on full display in the first quarter, with both teams shooting above 60% from the field, leading to a stalemate of 24-24 heading into the second quarter. 
The second quarter featured an offensive duel between Sissoko and Cal sophomore guard Jayda Curry. Sissoko racked up 14 points in the first half and Curry 12, with both teams tied up once more at 36 to end the first half. 
Sissoko had a hot hand all game and carried the offensive load for the Trojans in the second half, ending with a season-high 30 points. 
“I think defensively, they gave me the space to play my game,” Sissoko said. “My teammates were reading the plays perfectly and just trying to find me on offense.”
The teams were going back-and-forth, leading to an extra period of basketball. Overtime proved to be too much for the Trojans, who scored only 5 points in the 5 minutes of play. A last-second three by Littleton clanked off the rim, giving the Golden Bears a three-point win.
“I think it was really a tale of two different games,” Gottlieb said. “The first one was we couldn’t score in Stanford and this one is we couldn’t get enough stops. So I think it’s just understanding that at this time of year, a lot of games are possession games.” 
The Trojans will hit the court next Thursday against Washington at 8 p.m. at Galen Center.

USC defeated Ohio State 18-10 in their home opener at McAlister Field as the Trojans earned their first victory of the season Sunday. Entering the game, USC had just lost the season opener to Boston College 3-14. 
“We weren’t happy with how [the game] went, we wanted to look in the mirror and figure out what we needed,” said Head Coach Lindsey Munday in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Hard conversations needed to happen but they never lost confidence and belief in what we can do … the combination of wanting to get better but not wavering in your confidence and belief was what led us to this today.”
USC came out strong both offensively and defensively, scoring 4 straight goals to open the first period. The scoring effort was led by senior attacker Ella Heaney who netted 2 of the first 4 goals. Heaney went on to lead the game in scoring, contributing 4 of USC’s 18 total goals.
The offensive rhythm carried into the second period. The Trojans went on a 7-0 run before the Buckeyes’ senior attacker Nicole Ferrara ended the drought with a free position shot.
One key factor in USC’s offensive success came from the team’s draw control. The Trojans dominated that category 12-4 through two quarters of play.
USC sophomore attacker Maddie Dora, along with many Trojans, had a great day offensively.  Dora scored a hat trick and credited her success to the team’s unselfishness.
 “If you look at everybody, so many girls scored today and I think that’s just such a good representation of how patient we were and how much we shared the ball,” Dora said. “We waited to get the most open look and I feel like we’ve been working on that all week.”
The beginning of the second half continued to go USC’s way. The team went on another 4-0 run, marking the game’s largest game differential with 14-4 on the scoreboard with 5:36 left in the third.
Graduate captain and midfielder Katie Ramsay recorded 2 goals and 5 draw controls before getting ejected on two yellow cards in the last 20 seconds of the third quarter. Ramsay showed excitement to play with her younger sister, freshman attacker Maggie Ramsay, who stepped onto the field for the first time this season.
“I have just always enjoyed playing with these girls because it’s such a fun environment. It’s also super cool that I’m getting to play with my younger sister now, so everytime I step out on the field I’m just grateful that I got to take my fifth year and that I’m out here with all those girls,” Ramsay said.
Munday praised the team’s efforts to get better and puts trust in the players.
“I think this group wants to continue to get better,” Munday said. “We know that we’re not gonna be the same team [in] game 2 than we are in game 16 or 17, so this group has a desire to continue to get better. We’re happy with how we played today … this team has had to get 1% better everyday and that doesn’t change.”
USC looks to carry the momentum to San Diego State, who have only won once against the Trojans in their program’s history. USC will face off against San Diego State Friday at 2 p.m.

The No. 12 Trojans fell to No. 5 Grand Canyon University Friday night, leaving them 0-2 in their home series against the Antelopes. 
The Trojans opened Friday’s match with a 25-21 win in the first set but were unable to capitalize on their momentum, dropping the next three sets to the Antelopes. Even big games from freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein (15 kills) and graduate outside hitter Kevin Kobrine (14 kills) were unable to help the Trojans secure the match.
“We’re disappointed. They’re one of the top teams, but we are definitely at their level, so we’re definitely very disappointed,” Kobrine said. “It’s tough to be happy after a loss.”
The Trojans’ strong opening set came after a slow start Wednesday that saw USC drop the first two sets before they were able to get on the board with a 28-26 victory in set three. 
“We had a really good game plan for game one, but I felt like, in particular, we were a little slow on the block to go against their fast pace build-up,” said Head Coach Jeff Nygaard. “We knew we had to be able to get out there quicker, so we worked on getting that guy, our area two blocker, to make a faster move and start a little bit wider.”
While the changes worked for the Trojans to start off Friday’s game, GCU was able to adjust and win the next three sets by a thin margin, going 25-22, 25-20 and 25-22.
“We played clean volleyball for the first set,” Kobrine said. “We had flashes of greatness in sets two, three and four, we just couldn’t put the whole thing together.”
Nygaard said it was the small mistakes that kept the Trojans from building their lead early on, despite keeping the score close.
“They were just a little bit cleaner on the pushes and the throws and whatnot. We didn’t make as many digs on those, or touches,” Nygaard said. “We let them off the hook a couple times from the service line, and we let them get back into the game from the service line. We took our foot off the gas pedal.”
According to Kobrine, losing close sets is not reflective of a team’s talent or skill level.
“It’s just grit and hard work. Being relentless on defense, getting the balls that people think are down, just chasing them down and showing heart,” Kobrine said. “That’s the difference between one and two-point games.”
A bright spot in the Trojans’ two losses was their defense: USC was able to hold GCU to a .207 hitting percentage Wednesday and to .284 on Friday, compared to GCU’s season average of .357.
“We are blocking and defending pretty well,” Nygaard said. “It’s just that consistency piece so that our block and defense can actually do its job at a higher level.”
The losses against GCU dropped USC to 6-6 overall on the season, and 0-2 in conference play. The Trojans will look to bounce back next week when they host a doubleheader against No. 9 Stanford. 
“At the end of the day I think we are going to come in even harder on Monday,” said freshman setter Ryan Sprague. “We’re ready to work because Stanford, we know a bunch of those guys on that team, it’s a rivalry game in every sport, so we’ve just got to be ready for Stanford and use this as motivation because I don’t ever want to feel like this again.”
Still, the Trojans are confident in their ability to succeed down the stretch.
“We’re all bought into the process, we’re all bought into what we are doing, and we know full well that we have potential to be realized,” Nygaard said. “We’re committed to making sure that when we’re at the end of the season we are at the peak of that point, and we’re going to be really dangerous.”
The Trojans will return to the court Friday 7 p.m. to take on Stanford at Galen Center.

Martin Scorsese infamously refuses to call Marvel movies real “cinema,” instead choosing to describe them as “theme parks.” Despite how you feel about defining “cinema,” “theme park” might be too generous a description for this sheer sedative of a film, where the only thing keeping you from leaving is the potentially important setup of what’s next to come in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Looking ahead has been the key to Marvel’s success both critically and commercially for more than a decade, but it isn’t the reason why people love it.
There’s a difference between an MCU movie being particularly excited about because of how it may factor into the overarching plot or because you are especially invested in certain characters (any Wanda fans in the house?). In either case, you might feel the need to keep up with the rest of the movies so that you don’t miss out on important plot threads, essentially the genesis of this franchise’s undoubtable financial success. 
If you do choose to go see “Quantumania” for the film itself, Jonathan Majors, Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer are the only real reasons it’s worth sitting through. Though her role as Janet Van Dyne is a little bland and underwritten, Pfeiffer is absolutely game and fun to watch, while Majors fully commits to his role as Kang the Conqueror. Rudd still finds a way to shine in the role despite being sidelined in his own movie, a fate shared by co-star Evangeline Lilly, who is not only disappointingly underutilized but missing from large chunks of the film at a time. 
The Marvel villain problem, in which great actors are subjected to weak villain roles that have relatively no consequence other than to serve the protagonists’ motivations, is stronger than ever here. Apart from some anomalies, Majors’ Kang, the new Thanos-like big bad for the cinematic universe, continues this MCU trend. The main issue here is that Kang’s motivations are both so broadly defined that it is hard for the audience to really understand where he is coming from and why they should care.
Although a major complaint with the first two “Ant-Man” movies is that they feel too small — no pun intended — at least the stakes were emotional, thanks to the focus on the father-daughter relationship between Rudd’s Scott Lang and his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). Here, the film’s few attempts to create tension and heighten the drama feel derivative at best, and completely contrived at worst. The third act is like a low-rent “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” if that is even possible.
The film’s action sequences are poorly executed and choreographed. None of the luster from the Russo brothers’ Marvel outings is present, making it hard to find anything to get excited about. Apart from some obvious green screen moments, the visual effects are surprisingly not bad. Although the character of M.O.D.O.K. feels like a giant “f-you” from the underpaid visual effects artists, it’s probably the best thing to come out of the past few Marvel movies. This is because it leans into its own campiness, a quality which “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” doubled down on to the tune of $955 million worldwide.
Ultimately, the biggest takeaway from this film is how it continues to show that Marvel is at the crux of a monumental identity crisis. Although Marvel’s Kevin Feige promises all of this will pay off — which feels less and less like a reality nearly 20 projects into Phases 4 and 5 — Marvel has really struggled with what to make of itself post “Avengers: Endgame.” The issues that were already there, such as the incessant need to make everything funny and undercutting the drama, have been magnified. By trying to tackle too many new stories and characters too fast, new issues have arisen.
For one, the need to feed the beast that is Disney+ has forced Marvel to produce unprecedented levels of content. The plethora of talent necessary for this dilutes Feige’s sole creative clarity, causing each and every project to feel insignificant within the larger story. The overarching storyline has always been the cause for the MCU’s consistent success from project to project. Yet, even the most hardcore fans have been overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of movies and TV series that they must consume to keep up with the ever-expanding MCU.
At this time, films are going into production without entire third acts, visual effects are completed at the very last minute and the creative weight is shifted from Feige to underqualified writers who have varying visions of the Multiverse, leading to films that lack structure and feel disconnected from the main story. 
The audience’s habit of feeling the need to watch every project to keep up with the main story is essential for the long-running franchise’s consistently strong box office performance. It’s quite telling that Feige felt the need to announce last week that the studio would be scaling back to only two Disney+ shows this year — “Secret Invasion” and the much-anticipated second season of “Loki.” In addition to giving audiences breathing room, this will allow more time to polish and give attention to each and every project.
What undermines “Quantumania” as a film is that it’s sticking to the same worn-down formula, short of imagination and ingenuity. It lacks an overall conviction in its large-scale storytelling that has come to define those pre-“Endgame” films. With the formula intact, the MCU has become a lazy, docile entity content with being safe. With success a guarantee, the standard for quality is no longer there, and the storytelling is as a result allowed to be safe and uninspired.
What these latest films fail to realize is not just the connected nature of the earlier Marvel stories, which “Quantumania” at least attempts to accomplish after the relative stagnance felt in the past few MCU projects, but rather their indispensable joy and creativity. That was the genius of those first Marvel movies; the sense of interconnectedness was there in the episodic storytelling, but there was still always a focus on the characters and making sure each and every film — apart from “Thor: The Dark World,” of course — was at least an enjoyable time, and at best an experience worth treasuring.
Almost everybody remembers seeing “Iron Man” or “Guardians of the Galaxy” for the first time in theaters, but will anyone remember “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania”? That’s a question Feige and Marvel will need to ask themselves before work starts on the next 10 movies and Disney+ shows (the ones that aren’t already deep into production or post-production, that is).

Talented students bridged the gap left by an age-old, house-dividing rivalry between USC and UCLA Feb. 17 with an epic Battle of the Bands hosted by student radio stations KXSC and UCLA Radio. Students were welcomed into an intimate yet electrifying venue with art-covered walls and neon strobe lights, creating a cool atmosphere for the roaring mass of excited students.
UCLA DJ, radioactive gf, prepared the crowd for battle setting the scene with chill beats and techno mixes that created the perfect backdrop for students as they mingled and sipped on drinks provided by sponsors Liquid Death and June Shine. Throughout the DJ set, the floor was teeming with unbridled anticipation for the opening band Marguerite, who was welcomed by a sold-out crowd once they took the stage. 
Representing USC, Marguerite charmed the audience with their moody, melodic and indie-inspired sound, reminiscent of bands such as Good Morning and Snail Mail. The soft voice of lead singer and guitarist Katya Urban paired well with the potent drums and bass played by Ed Harmony and Ben Ross. The battle officially began as Marguerite’s moving performance set the tone for the budding competition. 
In stark contrast to the first band, Marguerite’s successor Infrared riled up the horde of already pumped students. Hailing from UCLA, Infrared’s angsty and guitar-heavy set had students thrashing their heads as if transported to the grunge scene of the late ‘90s. Living up to the band’s name, the competition was getting heated as a current of mosh pits ensued.
Next to the stage was My Betsy. This talented USC band — led by its namesake Betsy Schmeler with drummer Jordi, bassist Tayler Somerville, guitarist Meena Aspeytia and keys/trumpet player Sergio Rodriguez — instantly captivated audience members with their punchy, upbeat jams. With their cohesive and powerful performance, My Betsy won hearts over with their intoxicating sound and impressive instrumentals. 
UCLA’s Swade finished off the night with a bang. Their lighthearted funk-indie fusion kept the crowd moving, especially with their mashup cover of Thundercat’s “Them Changes” and Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good Day.” Swade’s lively performance was a perfect send-off for the Battle of the Bands. 
With a force that would have allied the Capulets and Montagues, these bands succeeded in unifying the crowd of Trojans and Bruins through the power of music, even if just for one night.
After a night of unbridled talent, passionate moshing and friendly competition, the judges deliberated and the winner of the battle was announced: My Betsy. The crowd roared with excitement, unified by a mutual appreciation of the concert’s success. Even UCLA students exclaimed “We love My Betsy,” supporting the Trojan victors. Despite any predispositions regarding the rivalry, the sheer talent of the performers and camaraderie among members of the crowd highlighted the importance of student-run concerts for the college music scene. 
USC junior Alina Agopian discussed the valuable community aspect of these performances. 
“Student-run shows are cool because it’s the easiest way to get to know other people that love music and it just feels so judgment-free anytime you go to a show,” Agopian said. “Everyone’s just there to enjoy music [and] get to know each other … it’s such a welcoming environment.”
Members of My Betsy reflected on the relevance of student-run shows from a band’s perspective. Schmeler recognized how these shows are “the root of independent music.”
“It seems like everybody’s really hyped on getting together and creating something, everybody using their own crafts, which is really sick,” Schmeler said.
Bassist Somerville expressed similar sentiments. 
“Playing a lot of shows as students and together is a way of growing,” she said. “I feel like if you play student showcases for USC, there’s a lot of pressure to it, to be perfect, but I feel like this is a way to make mistakes and grow and just have fun.”
USC junior Ella Parent shared just why these performances matter.
“It was unreal. It was like another level. It was amazing. It felt like what I was here for, what I went to USC for,” Parent said. “When you’re into music, it’s like this is our Trojan Pride. This is our Trojan Pride and it’s different than everyone else, but it’s there, and we represent our own community.”

With the midterm season coming out in full swing, stress levels are on the rise. Out of many de-stressing options, herbs are my favorite. They target both physical and emotional ailments, killing two birds with one stone. 
Herbs are a relatively cheap and effective way to battle stress, and each one affects the body differently. Some herbs can reduce levels of cortisol, the stress hormone in the blood, while others just aid in relaxation by altering the signal processing in the brain. 
Before you go out and buy a bunch of teas a tip to keep in mind is to always purchase organic loose-leaf teas. This usually means that the tea is grown and processed organically, so there are no chemicals, heavy metals or the other toxins that are usually found in heavily processed tea and even tea bags. Fun fact: most tea bags contain polypropylene, a non-biodegradable plastic that releases billions of microplastic particles when you brew a cup. 
For those who aren’t fans of drinking tea and would rather consume herbs with their joints, you can also smoke these herbs with or without cannabis. Some things to remember before the fun stuff: herbs can interact with medication and any underlying conditions, so before sparking up, make sure to speak to a healthcare professional who can greenlight your herb use. 
Smoking with herbs is experimental in a good way; You get to try different blends of herbs and cannabis. A great starting point for the weed-to-herb ratio is a 2:1 or 3:1. By slowly introducing the herbs you can see which effects and flavors you enjoy. On to the list: 
Chamomile
These vibrant yellow dried flowers are distinctive in herbal medicine for their soothing and therapeutic properties. Chamomile is a very mild sedative that calms an individual down mentally and physically. Not only can a cup of chamomile tea help reduce stress and alleviate anxiety, but it can also help the user sleep, soothe sore throats and help with digestion. Some side effects may include nausea, dizziness and allergic reactions. 
Lavender
Lavender has a rather delicate, almost sweet smell with a hint of earthiness. In tea, it is excellent for calming and relieving anxiety. It is also helpful for improving sleep quality and boosting mood, reportedly alleviating symptoms of mild depression and soothing headaches and migraines. Side effects may include constipation, increased appetite and skin irritation. When lighting the herb, it produces a very noticeable smell. The taste is slightly bitter and has an earthy flavor. While it does hit a little harsher, it certainly leaves a very flowery taste in your mouth, similar to what you would imagine a flower tasting like. 
Lemon balm
This member of the mint family was used in the Middle Ages since it was known to reduce stress and anxiety, promote sleep, improve appetite and ease discomfort caused by indigestion. It is safe to use every day in moderation, and possible side effects include increased appetite, nausea, dizziness and wheezing. Smoking this herb gives a hint of lemon, and its high is very laid back, delivering a sense of relief. 
Passionflower
Interestingly, studies have suggested that this herb increases gamma-aminobutyric acid in the brain, which is known to reduce activity in the central nervous system, creating a very mellow vibe aiding in relaxation, enhanced mood, better sleep and pain relief. When smoking this herb, it tastes very woody, like what a fireplace would taste like. The tea produces a bland flavor; it’s a little grassy and has a hint of a floral taste. 
Ashwagandha
Almost everyone on TikTok has seen the hype surrounding ashwagandha, and the advertisement is valid. For those who have not seen any videos about it, ashwagandha is an ancient medicinal herb and, frankly, a very well-researched herb considering research on herbs, in general, is sorely lacking. This herb is classified as an adaptogen, a substance that aids the body in coping with stress. It is also believed to benefit athletic performance and may alleviate generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, and clinical depression, among other benefits. Possible side effects include drowsiness, upper gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea. 
Blue Lotus
Blue Lotus is easy to spot due to its vibrant purple leaves and bright sunny yellow centers. This flower is great to help you cope with anxiety and panic disorders since it is high in vitamin B. Blue lotus is a hallucinogenic because of its two psychoactive compounds, apomorphine and nuciferine, which deliver euphoria and calm. That being said, the psychedelic reactions are very mild.
Mugwort
This sage-colored plant is commonly used in beer-making, but is also known to prevent and treat anxiety, digestion problems and irregular periods. It solves restlessness and anxiety while helping to improve mood through its flavonoid plant compound. Mugwort does not hit particularly harshly and generally has an almost pleasant taste to it. When drinking it in tea, it tastes pretty bitter, so sweetening it with sugar or honey may make it easier to drink. 
All in all, research proves the effectiveness of certain herbs, but, that being said, their use does not substitute prescription medication use or help from a mental health professional. Do your own research and consult a doctor before implementing any herb into your routine to ensure it’s safe for you and will not interact with any other medication you are taking.

Though it may have been too early in the year for California’s coveted delightfully-warm nights, the chill of Presidents Day weekend did nothing to stop massive crowds from descending on the festival grounds of the second annual California Vibrations Music Festival. Another success for Goldenvoice — an Los Angeles-based concert promoter known for hosting Coachella and Stagecoach — the three-day affair was a powerhouse move for many of the partners. The festival was filled with well-received advertisement campaigns from the likes of American Express, Monster Energy, Koi CBD and the Jamaica Tourist Board.
There were many notable performers that took part in the festival, such as Dirty Heads, Warren G, Slightly Stoopid and Stephen Marley. The obvious emphasis on reggae music worked wonders on the “vibe” of togetherness many fans felt throughout the events.
Reggae is a musical genre originating from Jamaica in the ‘60s, but also a cultural movement that has had significant contributions to social and political action. The music has a strong tie to community, often serving as a collective voice for marginalized groups. At the festival, attendees loudly welcomed even the yet-undiscovered Jamaica-native artists who were making their United States debut. Throughout the weekend, strangers became friends and many individuals found solace in meeting fellow music lovers. 
“Reggae is love. Reggae is unity. Reggae is everything,” said Jaylah Wilson, a junior majoring in political science. “It’s used to tell the story of who we are, and I just think that the Cali Vibes Music Festival perfectly encapsulates all of that.”
When Snoop Dogg was announced as Saturday’s special guest performer, he seemed to be a perfect pick for the role. As a Long Beach local, the renowned artist is widely considered to be one of the gems of California. For a performance that started with a short film featuring Snoop Dogg walking down a hallway at an incredibly slow pace, the hour flew by with three decades-worth of hits ranging from “Drop It Like It’s Hot” to “Young, Wild & Free.” Flanked by an on-stage entourage of fellow vocalists, pole dancers and the mascot of smoking monkey NFTs, the star preached up an unholy storm to a crowd that knew every single word. It was pure chaos, and perfectly synchronous.
The second day’s highlight — and arguably one of the best performances — came in the form of  Tiny Desk Concert alum Tash Sultana. As an incredibly talented multi-instrumentalist, Sultana wove sound and song through looping and — with the support of a seriously groovy band — she set an extremely high precedent for future Cali Vibes headliners.
Jack Johnson, known for his multiple No. 1 albums and — more importantly — soundtracking the Curious George film, was the festival’s other special guest performer. For a festival very much populated with reggae performances, Johnson’s performance ended the night with a welcomed change of pace. The former surfer’s performance was a comforting bear hug to a sardine-like crowd. With a vibe he could only derive from having years of fatherhood under his belt, Jack Johnson sang, blew into beer bottles and strummed his way into the hearts of anyone within earshot. Even with guests, Johnson stood unwaveringly in his headliner charisma. If anyone hadn’t seen Jack Johnson before, they’d be surprised to see a man taking the stage with mere jeans and a hoodie. If Snoop Dogg was straight-man-camp, then Jack Johnson was the perfect granola pairing for the other half of the legendary headliner duo.
As the founder of non-profit public charities such as the Johnson Ohana Foundation and the Kōkua Hawai’i Foundation, Johnson has been active in his environmental advocacy, and the impacts of his presence show throughout the festival. Collaborations between Goldenvoice and Jack Johnson’s team have led to the promoter donating to Johnson’s foundation, which will redirect these funds to local Southern California community groups including Algalita, 5 Gyres, Plastic Pollution Coalition, Surfrider Foundation, Upstream and the Rob Machado Foundation. The organizations were also invited to the event to engage with festival attendees on-site. Cali Vibes also had a notable partnership with r.cup, with many of the vendors choosing to use the zero-waste, reusable cup. 
The festival also invited numerous vendors to line their walkways, and there seemed to be a throughline of sustainability and psychedelia that struck true for many of these businesses. Apart from a global variety of foods offerring throughout the festival grounds, Cali Vibes partnered with various artist brands, merchandise storefronts and quality select shops that attendees couldn’t keep themselves away from. 
One of these vendors was Sunny Life, a burgeoning artisan, eco-textile brand that boasts a social mission of direct action in communities all around the world. By creating mutually beneficial partnerships that provide valuable resources to all parties while also producing festival-ready wear, vendors like these reflect much of Cali Vibes’ direction.
“We love being with folks who understand our mission the best. Cali Vibes, the reggae scene, we feel so well received,” said Sunny Taylor, the founder of Sunny Life. “I’m doing this because we were blessed with skills, resources, tools and connections, all of us. And we’re here to play a role to serve the highest, to serve each other and do the best that we can with what we have. If we’re not doing that, I feel like it’s doing an injustice.”
The 2023 iteration of Cali Vibes presented a music festival that felt truly authentic and tight-knit, even despite the magnitude of the event itself. With a strong showing from this year’s performers and a nearly eco-guilt-free experience, returning to the festival seems to be a no-brainer. Whether you’re reggae’s biggest fan or a casual concertgoer looking for a fun, cost-effective way to enjoy live music, Cali Vibes is an easy recommendation to make. 
All eyes will be on Goldenvoice to see whether they’ll be able to turn this two-hit wonder into an annual Long Beach gem.
