With April 15 quickly approaching, filing tax returns might appear daunting to some students.
The IRS, however, aims to make filing tax returns a simple process for everyone.
According to Jennifer Henrie-Brown, an IRS tax specialist, the IRS has an informative website that includes instructions to guide people through the filing process.
Civic duty · Most students who work full- or part-time jobs will have to fill out the 1040 tax form. Depending on income, some students will get a tax refund after filing their returns. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
If a student is not certain as to whether they should file a tax return, the IRS has three charts to assist students.
Most students who are obligated to file a tax return, according to Henrie-Brown, will fall under Chart A as singles under the age of 65 with a total income of at least $9,350. Students under the age of 24 can be claimed as dependents by their parents, but students who are claimed as dependents should still file their own taxes if they earned more than $5,700.
Even if a student is not expected by federal or state law to file a tax return, it might be beneficial for students with jobs to do so.
“There is a possibility that [students can] get refunded. If [a student] is not required to file a tax return, but the employer withholds federal income tax, the only way for [the student] to receive the money is to file a return,” Henrie-Brown said.
Though the IRS has attempted to make the process as simple as possible, some students still shy away from filing their own taxes.
“Even though I have a job, I’ve barely made any money,” said Ava Casados, a junior majoring in fine arts and psychology. “It’s definitely easier for my parents to [file my tax return] because there’s really not much work that needs to be done.”
Ari Stobaugh, a freshman majoring in political science, said she also relies on her parents to help with her tax return.
“I help my parents, but I basically let them handle my tax return because they’ve done it for 30 years and just know what they’re doing,” Stobaugh said.
Though many students at USC find it easier to have their parents handle their tax returns, Thomas Griffith, professor of law and taxation, said he believes students should attempt to file their own returns.
“Students should bite the bullet and try to do the tax returns [themselves],” Griffith said. “And if you make a mistake, don’t worry about it. As long as you are not trying to cheat the IRS, they will send you a letter either with the amount still owed or money because you paid too much.”
Griffith said the IRS instructions are fairly clear for students who take their time to understand them, and he thinks tax preparers are superfluous for students.
Since changes to the tax laws occur frequently, Henrie-Brown said it can be difficult for most people, especially students, to stay up to date. To make the process smoother, the IRS offers e-file, a “fast, easy and accurate solution to filing tax returns.” The service is available at www.irs.gov.
Students and others who earn an income under $57,000 can also use Free File, the free IRS version of e-file, also online.
“Free File asks simple questions and it completes your tax forms for you. It ensures that you get all of the tax breaks you are supposed to,” Henrie-Brown said.
According to Henrie-Brown, Free File has an accuracy rate of 99 percent as opposed to paper returns that have an 80 percent accuracy rate.
Students who file on Free File also receive an acknowledgment of receipt 48 hours after the IRS receives the forms.
But even with Free File and e-file and the IRS instructions, some students still find tax preparers helpful.
“I know e-file is really quick and does it for free, but I’m just scared that I won’t get the maximum amount of money,” said David Herrera, a junior majoring in accounting. “I don’t want to risk it, so I figured I’d just pay someone $60.”
Students who are worried about mistakes on their tax returns can speak with trained individuals from the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program who help low- to moderate-income taxpayers.
“Even I have made some mistakes but for students, books about taxes and preparers are unnecessary. The IRS site and instructions are just as good,” Griffith said.
While many students seek help from tax preparers or have their parents deal with it, a few choose to file taxes on their own.
Sarah Morris, a senior majoring in theatre, filed her own taxes last year to gain the experience.
“I wanted to feel prepared after college,” Morris said. “My parents helped me for three years, but [tax returns are] fairly easy. It’s mainly a lot of paper trailing so it’s more tedious than difficult.”
The tax process is slightly different for international students, who cannot do e-file or Free File at the federal level but can do e-file or Free File for the state level unless they had income exempted by a tax treaty, according to Rebecca Peterson, an international students adviser for the Office of International Services.
On March 26, at 4 p.m. in room 202 of Taper Hall, the Office of International Services will host a session to help international students fill out the California tax form.
Clarification: Ava Casados said she did not file an income tax return because she did not have an income last year.

Most students concerned about their academic performance go to their professors’ office hours or seek extra help, but some, according to the Department of Public Safety, report fake crimes instead.
It is not uncommon, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said, for students to file reports of crimes that did not occur as a way of diverting attention from their grades. This phenomenon is particularly common around midterms and finals.
The most recent fake crime occurred just before spring break. According to Carlisle, a student reported being robbed near campus, but when DPS investigated the student admitted making the story up so his parents would pay less attention to his academic problems.
“We must investigate each reported crime, and, in the case of something serious like a robbery, issue a timely warning within a relatively short period of time,” Carlisle said. “These warnings increase the perception of the USC community not being safe. It is particularly frustrating when we have been working so hard to lower crime to change some people’s perception of our community and then have a student make something up.”
Concerned that false crime reports place an unnecessary strain on DPS resources and create unwarranted panic, DPS is now warning students that it plans to join LAPD and begin seeking criminal charges when fake crimes are reported.
“Filing a false police report is a crime. It contributes to an unsafe environment by misdirecting police resources, and it contributes to the fear of crime in the USC campus community,” DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas wrote in an e-mail.
DPS Investigation Det. Josh Voyda said reports submitted to DPS are reviewed by detectives from both DPS and LAPD. Even when the officers’ investigative experience tells them a crime doesn’t sound right, they still have to investigate it to prove it is a false report.
“We are not able to simply ignore a false report. We need to prove it is false in order to remove the report from our statistics, which need to be accurate if they are going to be useful to anyone,” Voyda wrote in an e-mail.
Thomas echoed this idea, emphasizing the strain on law enforcement resources.
“We still treat each reported crime as valid until there is overwhelming evidence and/or story inconsistencies that suggest that the crime is more likely to not have occurred,” Thomas wrote. “Obviously, by this time, many investigative hours by both DPS and LAPD officers and detectives have been wasted, and oftentimes the crime alert has been sent, and the perception or fear of crime continues to spread.”
Thomas said that usually a student will falsely report a crime in a location where DPS has cameras. When that happens, DPS reviews the footage from the location and if there is no evidence of crime in that area they inform the student. Many times, that leads to a confession.
Thomas noted that, despite DPS’ efforts, there are times when they cannot prove a crime is false and are forced to report it, inflating crime rates.
“While we may actually get some confessions that a student has made up that they were the victim of a crime, there are some reported crimes that, based upon our expertise [do] not add up. We never obtain an admission that the crime was fabricated,” Thomas wrote. “So, we can never know exactly what percentage of these crimes are falsified despite our suspicions.”
Currently, when a report is discovered to be false, the circumstances are submitted to the city attorney for review, Voyda said.
“Filing a false report is considered a misdemeanor. If the city attorney feels the case warrants criminal charges, they will initiate prosecution in court,” Voyda wrote.
To help crack down on false crime reports, DPS is now planning to refer students to the Student Judicial Affairs Committee and seek criminal prosecution.
Many students said they think it is harmful for other students to report false crimes.
Daniela Baumann, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said she thinks students who file false police reports don’t consider how everyone around them is affected.
“It scares people for no reason or gives the area a bad reputation when it isn’t that bad,” Baumann said.
Jiangyang Zhang, a graduate student studying electrical engineering, compared these false reports to people starting rumors, which causes the school to have a bad reputation.
“It’s a build up of a negative image and, because of the preconceived perspective that USC is not a safe school, it makes it easier to deteriorate the image of safety in the school,” Zhang said.
Carlisle pointed out that there are unlimited resources available from the university for students struggling with problems in or outside of the classroom to avoid these false reports.
“Filing a false police report is never the answer to one’s problems,” Carlisle said. “It only leads to more problems.”

As students select their classes over the next few weeks, most will turn to the advice of friends rather than online course review sites, which some say are incomplete and incomprehensive.
There are a number of online course review options available to students, including the Undergraduate Student Government’s Course Guide, ratemyprofessor.com and the university’s course evaluation website. Many students, however, do not find any of these options particularly useful.
“I’ve found that I trust my friends’ judgments,” said Blake Spencer, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
The university’s site provides statistical data based on the course evaluations distributed in classes each semester, which consists of 12 questions on a scale of one (poor) through five (excellent). Ratemyprofessor.com and USG’s site offer numerical data and free response questions.
“We hope that as many students as possible participate, and if they don’t, then the data is not as accurate,” said Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs.
The site features reviews dating back a number of years and is particularly helpful if searching for a professor who has not taught in a while, said Bickers. A user can search by school or professor and download results into a Microsoft Excel file.
The data is not enough for some students, however.
“It’s kind of helpful, but not really,” said Alan Chang, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. “There’s nowhere to comment.”
Many students agreed they prefer the course guides that include free response answers.
“I try to see what people say about the professor’s effectiveness and whether or not they’re easy to learn from and if they’re boring,” said Vivien Lee, a senior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures and psychology, who said she most often uses ratemyprofessor.com.
USG’s website also includes free response answers, but because the site was relaunched only two years ago, many courses and professors are still missing.
All of the information collected on the course guide website is voluntary information from students.
Each student who logs on responds to five general questions — such as how effective was the course in achieving its goals and how interesting was the course on a scale of one (not effective) through seven (very effective) — followed by four free response questions and overall course recommendation percentages.
“Students can get a more holistic look,” said Andrew Matson, USG director of academic affairs. “The site provides students with more information to make their own judgments on each course.”
Still, because it is voluntary, the offerings are incomplete.
“I feel like they’re pretty effective, I just wish there were more reviews,” Lee said.
USG plans to launch an advertising campaign around the time of the registration period this semester to let people know about the course guide and encourage students to use the site.
“If we could get more students to use the course guide, it would be perfect,” Matson said. “The more you help, the more you help everyone.”
Students feel there is no one source that has all of the answers when searching for course evaluation information, and USC’s sites are no exception.
“It gives you a general idea so you know what to expect when you first see your professor, but other than that, it’s not really helpful,” Chang said.
In the end, most students say they choose to rely on information from friends.
“A large part of it is asking people who have already taken classes,” said Michael Soh, a freshman majoring in civil engineering who was not aware of how to access the course evaluation resources USC offers.
That’s why you take these ratings with a grain of salt. What one person percieves isn’t the same way you will. One student will grasp an academic concept better than another; one student will experience “better chemistry” with a professor than another; one student will get favorable treatment from a professor over another, etc.

More than 25 Campus Cruiser employees, all anxious to hear the result of a resolution that would recommend extending Cruiser hours, were present at the Undergraduate Student Senate meeting Tuesday.
Cruising · Campus Cruiser drivers listen to the debate at Tuesday’s Senate meeting as senators discuss the resolution to extend Cruiser’s hours. About 25 drivers attended. - Scott Fairbanks | Daily Trojan 
Though the resolution ultimately passed by a vote of 7-2, USG senators debated the resolution for almost an hour before voting.
Some of the key issues discussed included student interest in extended hours and the strain that could be placed on Cruiser’s resources and student drivers if service was extended.
Currently, Campus Cruiser runs until 2:45 a.m. on the University Park Campus. The resolution recommends extending the hours until 3:45 a.m. and includes recommendations to administrators to provide more cars and money to Campus Cruiser.
Director of Campus Affairs Helen Moser and Residential Senator Wilson Kyi said there was an overwhelming student interest in increasing the hours of Campus Cruiser and that they felt it was their responsibility to advocate for students.
Campus Cruiser Supervisor Kevin Aguirre said at the Senate meeting that he thinks one of the main problems is student attitudes toward Cruiser and misinformation about how the process works.
“People call in and they feel like we should pick them up immediately,” Aguirre said. “I think the needs are being addressed in the wrong way.”
Campus Cruiser employees said their biggest issue with the resolution is the late hours the employees have to work and the safety of the employees themselves.
“Students are spoiled,” Julius Cotton, a junior majoring in business administration and a Campus Cruiser employee, said at the meeting. “They go out and party without knowing how to get home.”
Extending hours would also require Cruiser to hire more employees and acquire more vehicles.
Kyi said he does not wish to force drivers to do something they do not want to and hopes to represent the interests of all students, including Cruiser drivers.
“The point of the resolution is to let the administration know,” Kyi said. “We want to see everyone’s reaction. Now that we know that Campus Cruiser doesn’t like it, we’ll be sure to let the administration know as well.”
Moser said if the hours are expanded to 3:45 a.m. USG will recommend the university consider professional drivers if students are unwilling to drive at that time.
Greek Senator Dylan Dann noted that students seemed to be looking for taxi-like services, not necessarily Campus Cruiser, and he thought the resolution should have been aimed at USC Transportation as a whole, not just Cruiser. Dann voted against the resolution.
Moser and Kyi said they have been advocating for the trams and also Yellow Cab, where students can pay with discretionary money, but the resolution focused on Cruiser because students have said they feel unsafe taking a tram or walking home.
Campus Cruiser employees declined to comment after the vote. The Cruiser manager could not be reached.
Moser said the next step is meeting with Campus Cruiser drivers to hear more of their concerns and understand the issue better so that they can be better represented.
“We will continue lobbying for this talk with the administration,” Moser said. “They have always responded to student needs. I don’t foresee that they would take their needs out of the picture.”
Kyi described the current resolution as general, but he and Moser hope to make it more specific in the upcoming weeks before they pass it off to the administration.
whatever cruisers, take me to Del Taco or you’re fired!
Well most of us would not have the need to use cruiser if only the Trams and the Tram drivers were reliable.
The Tram drivers very often skip tram stops and modify the routes per their own whim and fancy, they especially do this if they are running late. They will ask people on the bus if anyone wants to get dropped off at XYZ location, if not the driver simply does not go that route, but they forget there might be people waiting to board the tram at XYZ location. USC Transportation, please improve Tram service and instill discipline in Tram drivers first, then consider extending Cruiser hours.
I wish JMP/Walsh would have been elected…
Is there some sort of impeachment process?
recount.
I think if one takes a look at the records for the number of calls the Leavey driver receives, they will understand there is no need for extra cruiser hours.  The Leavey driver along with the assistance of DPS (Who are dedicated to public safety) is enough to suffice all the people pulling all nighters or those who partied too hard and still need to get home.  There is no “need” for extra cruiser hours, this is simply an example of spoiled children wanting extra conveniences so they can stay out later after the 9-0 closes.  We are a service dedicated to SAFETY not CONVENIENCE and should be treated as such.  If a student wants to get home before 3AM and wants to utilize the services of campus cruiser, then they’ll call before 2:45AM just like they always have.  If they choose to stay out past that time for whatever reason, they need to plan to find another method of transportation home.  Although it is not DPS’s main function, they will be more than happy to accommodate a quick ride home, or they will contact the Leavey driver to come and get you. Plain and simple.
Campus cruiser is not a babysitting service for drunk people.  Here’s the mission statement:
“The USC Campus Cruiser program offers safety escorts during the evening hours by providing a walking or vehicle escort within the University of Southern California community…We provide…service to and from a residence to and from a facility not serviced by the tram service and within our boundaries.”
Notice how the word “drunk” does not appear there.  Do you really think the university would condone excessive and underage drinking by providing a service specifically for drunk students?
I’m confused.  If Campus Cruiser isn’t meant to take me home when I’m drunk, what is it for?
Cruiser isn’t just for drunk.  In fact, most of the people I drive are going to or from study places on campus (computer labs, libraries, etc.).  A lot of other people are just going to friend’s places for whatever reason (as in a call from an apartment on ellendale to one on 37 pl on a tuesday night).  Also, if someone is really really intoxicated, cruiser drivers won’t take you and they’ll refer you to DPS.  Believe me, I have refused to take really drunk people before.
And honestly, if you care that much about getting drunk at ridiculous hours in an incredibly dangerous area outside of your residence and you still can’t get off your butt to call for a ride before 2:45, should the university really take care of your complete lack of responsibility?  No.
Isn’t it a bit ironic that students say that cruiser hours need to be extended until 345 because its “unsafe” when they are staying out that late and putting themselves in a dangerous situation?
I understand the want to extend the hours but this is at the expense of so many people. As someone mentioned above, now 30 people will have to find their way home at 4am or later from grant which is way more dangerous.
With this resolution, chances are every cruiser will be required to work 1 shift a week until 4am. I am a student too. I have homework and I have a life… I would really prefer not to have to pull an all nighter every week just so some drunk kid can skip the tram and comfortably take the cruiser while i am pointlessly worrying if they are going to throw up in my car and have to clean it up myself.
Instead of complaining all the time maybe a little appreciation would be nice… We offer a service that isnt available at most campuses. But yet I get yelled at everytime I handle phones because someone doesn’t want to take the tram or thinks the wait time is too long… 1. What makes you think you have the right to yell at a student? 2. if we could give you a faster time we would. Plain and simple but just like you, there are about 25 other students calling at the same time wanting a ride as soon as possible.. BE REALISTIC. 3. We can’t give you a ride if you are on a tram route. its not our choice, that is what we are instructed to tell you by the university so why do you get angry at us? Don’t kill the messenger.
“there was an overwhelming student interest in increasing the hours of Campus Cruiser and that they felt it was their responsibility to advocate for students”
I’m sure there is an overwhelming student interest in a lot of issues at USC. It doesn’t mean those changes should be implemented if they are not logical. For example, I know myself and a lot of my friends would love to have free student football tickets. If you send out a student survey, you would be amazed at the response of students who want free tickets. Is that actually possible though?
One of the fundamental issues we have against extending the hours of campus cruiser is that, after 2:45 AM nobody has any business at all being outside of the apartments alone.  I understand that sometimes people find themselves in emergency situations, but the current resources available to students who find themselves in such circumstances have several recourses: yellowcab, DPS, the leavey driver.  Besides that small number of people, nobody should need rides.  At that hour, nobody should be getting drunk, studying at the library, etc.  10 hours is more than enough time.
We work hard every night until the most ridiculous hours taking tons of people who clearly don’t NEED our services but merely enjoy the convenience: people going a few blocks in large groups, people asking for rides to fast food restaurants at 1 in the morning.  So when everyone turns around and asks to work even later, we get understandably irritated.  At a certain point, you have to take responsibility for your own actions.  The university already does SO MUCH to protect your safety: DPS monitoring non-stop, security personnel stationed 24/7, cameras everywhere.  If you are completely wasted at 3:30 in the morning in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in LA, you need to re-evaluate your life decisions and not turn around and blame me.  You have already been given so much: the chance to attend a prestigious school and a free service that offers ten hours of rides.  Anymore is ridiculous.
I am more concerned about the fact that half of us will be totally asleep at 4am and unable to provide said SAFE RIDES, right?
And honestly, I felt some sympathy for the PRs tonight — until some drunk girl told me she would walk down to Campus Cruiser and vomit on me for not giving her a car immediately. Turns out she was calling DPS yelling at them about us. If that’s not the definition of spoiled and entitled…
I don’t care what any person says, the reality of the problem comes down to the CONVENIENCE of cruiser over trams and yellow cabs. The LARGE majority of people use safety as a scapegoat. If you are a student who lives east of Vermont or east of Figueroa, you have a legit safety concern because trams don’t go to those areas (how about USG tries and extend tram routes to go west of campus…) and those “security guards” with yellow jackets don’t “scout” those areas. Otherwise, there is absolutely no reason to extend cruiser hours past 3am. Those “security guards” are posted at almost every block within Vermont & Fig, and there is an all-night tram that services the majority of those areas. Be responsible and realize that after 3am you should have some type of plan to get home [& if not, use DPS if you’re really scared…they’re the ones with full time jobs based entirely on safety…]. 
Also, keep in mind that on average there are about 20-30 cruisers who find their way home safely EVERY night @ 3:15am from GRAND/JEFFERSON to places as far as NORMANDIE/EXPO. How do we do it? WE can’t take cruiser can we? What about our safety? And now you’re telling us that we have to find a way home @ 4:15am? That doesn’t sound inconsiderate and myopic to you? That’s bogus…if we can do it so can you
And just to put it out there, many of our frustrations are coming from the fact that many students are just as Julius stated: “spoiled.” They complain and whine about when we’re late and when we G.O.A them, while failing to recognize that we’re backed up that night [b/c people don’t take trams] or because we waited for other students that were late themselves. They complain and whine about waiting on the phone for 15min and getting a cruiser in 20min, while failing to recognize we get about 900 calls a night, meaning about 110 calls per hour, meaning we have about 30sec per call (barring human error and getting in an argument with a PR EVERY TIME we tell them to take the tram) to collect a bunch of info & determine the best way to accommodate everyone in a timely fashion. They complain and whine when we don’t cater to their every wish. NEWSFLASH! Cruiser is a safety service, not a convenience service. Instead of being upset at your cruiser when it is 10min late picking you up from a security detailed sorority house, and 10min late dropping you off @ your respective classroom on our gated campus protected by DPS, try thanking the cruiser for doing his/her job, which is to get you from point A to point B SAFELY. That being said, if cruiser hours are indeed extended, there are many issues about the service that must be addressed…the safety vs. convenience issue being a front runner.
That is all.

What I still don’t understand is how the survey was collected to gauge this “overwhelming student interest” in lengthening Cruiser hours. Was it a Yes/No poll asking to extend our hours or was it gathering open suggestions? Can the methods and results of the survey be publicly viewed? Sure, I’d vote yes to get more free services from USC, but not at the expense of other people and not when it diverts or increases my tuition towards unnecessary expenses and redundant services. I hope that USG takes a much deeper look at what they claim is the true student interest before lobbying to get this resolution passed.
Dann has it right — let’s look at  ALL of Transportation please. I wouldn’t get so many people angry and unwilling to take the trams if trams drivers made sure to stop at every location and wait a moment for students to board. The trams drivers should be subject to the same monitoring as Cruisers!

Multiple sources, including the Los Angeles Times and the Los Angeles Daily News, are reporting that sophomore forward Leonard Washington has been dismissed from the USC men’s basketball team.
Contributor · During his two seasons at USC, sophomore forward Leonard Washington averaged 6.1 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
According to a report by the Times, sources close to the situation say Washington was dismissed March 7, one day after USC’s season had ended in a double-overtime loss to Arizona. The primary reason for his dismissal was a poor attitude, the sources said.
The sources spoke anonymously because Washington has not yet received his official release. An announcement from the school is expected soon.
USC basketball spokesman David Tuttle said no official roster changes had been made as of Tuesday afternoon. Washington and USC coach Kevin O’Neill could not be reached for comment.
Although it was widely believed that Washington would leave the team at the end of the season, he was still surprised by news of his dismissal, the sources in the Times report said.
After missing the first 10 games of the season because of academic ineligibility, Washington returned to action Dec. 23 to help USC defeat St. Mary’s at the Diamond Head Classic in Hawaii. Washington was a key contributor off the bench for the Trojans, averaging 6.2 points and 4.4 rebounds in his final 20 games.
In a mysterious move midway through the season, Washington imposed a personal ban on speaking to reporters. Washington said, “[I’ll] never talk to the media again. I’ll pay fines in the NBA if I have to.”
O’Neill said Washington is looking to transfer soon, though it is unclear which schools the 6-foot-7 forward might consider.
“It’s headed in that direction,” O’Neill told the Daily News on Friday.
One possible destination is Washington’s home state of Louisiana. Neworleans.com reported last Wednesday that former USC coach Tim Floyd is being considered for the head coaching position at Louisiana Lafayette. Floyd, currently an assistant coach with the New Orleans Hornets, recruited Washington to play for the Trojans.
According to that report, school officials requested information from the NCAA on Floyd’s status, as there have been allegations that he once paid Rodney Guillory, the advisor to former USC player O.J. Mayo. Floyd testified before the NCAA Committee on Infractions in February at a hearing involving an investigation into alleged NCAA rules violations at USC.

If there’s one word synonymous with spring, it’s football. That’s right — now that basketball season is over at USC, it’s time to turn our attention toward the mecca that is Howard Jones Field.
The Trojans begin spring practice in just six days. So to get ready, I will take out my Magic 8 ball — the Brent Musburger edition (because nothing says college football quite like good ol’ Brent) — and ask these five burning questions facing USC.
1. Now that the Pete Carroll era is over, how different will the Trojans look under new coach Lane Kiffin and the almost completely new staff?
Musburger Magic 8 ball answer: Hang on there partner.
There is no doubt there was a trademark vibe around the USC program during Carroll’s decade at the school. The players always seemed to be loose both on the sidelines and off the field, and they had a confident swagger. Carroll was directly responsible for this. He was the 50-year-old kid who never grew up, as evidenced by his constant pranks. His SoCal cool-yet-fiery demeanor appealed to fans. It’ll be interesting to see how the dynamic of the team changes around the much younger, more tense and unproven Kiffin.
2. Who will  win the battle to replace arguably two of the most valuable players the Trojans lost, receiver Damian Williams and running back Joe McKnight?
Musburger: Oh this one is shaping up to be a dandy folks.
The two most important players here are freshmen wide receiver Kyle Prater and running back Dillon Baxter. Both of these players enrolled this spring and will be out practicing with the team next week. This is critical as it gives them extra time to help fill the void left by the team’s leading receiver and rusher last year. Both players have tremendous talent — Prater was a 2009 All-American and Baxter was named the 2009 High School Player of the Year by multiple outlets ­— so look for them to make an impact immediately.
The Trojans don’t have many players to replace the speedy McKnight, as senior Allen Bradford is more of a bruiser and fellow senior C.J. Gable needs to learn how to hold onto the football. Junior Marc Tyler was the second ranked running back behind McKnight out of high school, but he has been hobbled with injuries in his first three years.
As for wide receiver: “This will be one of the most important position groups for us to figure out through spring practice,” Kiffin said in the 2010 Spring Prospectus.
3. Will the linebacking corps perform up to expectations?
Musburger: Folks, I have never seen a more beautiful sight.
Indeed, all three linebackers return from last year’s heralded unit that didn’t quite live up to expectations. After Carroll proclaimed that they might be better than the trio that went to the NFL after the 2008 season, the corps put up solid numbers in the first half of the year before failing miserably in the second half. They have experience now and, under defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin’s watch, should become one of the best units in the country.
4. Will USC’s secondary get destroyed this year after losing all four starters, including All-American safety Taylor Mays?
Musburger: It’s a footrace!
That’s never a good thing to hear from Musburger when your team is on defense. Out of all the areas on the field, the secondary is the spot where the Trojans have the least experience. Starting cornerbacks Josh Pinkard and Kevin Thomas and starting safeties Mays and Will Harris have all departed.
The Trojans have just one scholarship senior on the roster, redshirt junior Shareece Wright, and he didn’t even play last year — save for the Emerald Bowl — because he was academically ineligible. Junior T.J. Bryant and redshirt sophomore Brian Baucham saw limited time in the nickel package last year while junior Drew McAllister and sophomore T.J. McDonald have the most experience at the safety position, which isn’t saying much, as they have just one start between them. Monte Kiffin and defensive backs coach Willie Mack Garza have a challenging situation on their hands to get this very young and inexperienced group ready for play in the fall.
5. Will we have a football team past this spring?
Question intercepted by Lou Holtz 8 ball: It’s like kissing your sister, but that’s a lot better than kissing your brother. Notre Dame will be in the national championship this year.
Wow a two-fer from Lou! What condition that team will be in remains to be seen based on the sanctions (if any) handed down by the NCAA in about a month. The good news: We haven’t heard anything about Lane Kiffin breaking any recruiting violations … yet.
“Spittin’ Sports” runs Wednesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Kenny at klegan23@gmail.com.
Love the Lou Holtz reference….very good article…well thought out
Great article and very witty.  Keep it up!

The Trojans seemed to finally have it in their grasp. The No. 13 USC men’s golf team, 13 months removed from its last tournament victory, was in a great position on the final hole of its title match with New Mexico in the 2010 Callaway Collegiate Match Play Championship in Tucson, Ariz.
Firing · Freshman T.J. Vogel won his singles match 5 and 4 over UNM’s James Erkenbeck Tuesday at the Callaway Match Play Championships. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The Trojans and Lobos had split the day’s first four matches, leaving USC freshman Martin Trainer and New Mexico’s John Catlin to battle for the deciding point.
Trainer was two holes up with two to play but bogeyed the 17th. Catlin made birdie to extend the match. On the par-four 18th, Trainer hit his approach shot to inside 15 feet while Catlin’s second shot left him over 30 feet from the cup.
With members of both teams watching around the green, Catlin drained the long putt while Trainer missed his.
“Shocked. Absolutely shocked,” USC coach Chris Zambri said about his team’s reaction to Catlin’s putt. “He had about 32 feet, putting straight down a big swell, and if he misses the putt we win, and he made it.”
On the first playoff hole Trainer hit his drive into a cactus and made bogey. Catlin made par and gave the Lobos the tournament championship.
“I felt like I should have won but I just kind of fell apart at the end,” Trainer said. “It was kind of a miraculous putt on the 18th hole for him but all credit to him.”
Trainer’s loss in the final was the only defeat he suffered during the week. He won three straight matches over the first two days of the tournament to help USC reach the final.
USC, seeded eighth in the 16-team field, defeated No. 9 Texas Christian University in the first round 4-1 with match victories from Trainer, freshman T.J. Vogel, sophomore Steve Lim and junior Matt Giles.
Next up was top-seeded Stanford, ranked No. 2 in the nation. The Trojans squeaked out a 3-2 victory with wins from Trainer, Vogel and Lim.
In the semifinals, Trainer, Lim and freshman Stewart Hagestad grabbed wins to help USC beat Colorado State 3-2 and advance to the final.
Vogel and Giles won their matches against New Mexico State, but it wasn’t enough.
“It’s certainly good preparation for the national championship,” Zambri said, referring to the match play format at the NCAA championship. “You can’t win a national title if you don’t win three matches in match play.”
The Trojans were busy over the break as well, finishing in a tie for third at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters held March 12 to 14 in Las Vegas.
Vogel turned in another impressive display in the desert, finishing second overall for the second straight tournament. His three round total of four over par was one shot behind tournament winner Jesper Kennegard of Arizona State.
“My game is about as good as it has been,” Vogel said. “There are a few things I need to work on short game wise but ball-striking wise I’m at the highest I’ve ever been. I feel really confident.”
As a team, USC shot 44 over par, nine strokes behind co-champions UNLV and UCLA.
Hagestad shot 13 over and finished in a tie for 21st while Trainer posted a 31st place finish at 16 over par. Lim tied for 37th at 18 over and Giles shot 20 over to finish in a tie for 43rd.
With two top-three finishes in the last week, the Trojans are heating up as they move into the stretch run of the season.
“This gives us confidence that we can compete with the best, even though we’re young,” Vogel said.
Zanbri agreed, saying he had high hopes for his team.
“We’re definitely rounding into a team that has a chance to win a national title,” he said. “We can compete with the best teams in the country; there’s no doubt about that.”

The USC baseball team managed only four hits but took advantage of three Pepperdine errors to defeat the Waves 3-2 Tuesday night in its final tune-up before heading into conference play this weekend.
Running wild · Junior second baseman Joe De Pinto was held hitless in Tuesday’s 3-2 win over Pepperdine but scored the winning run after an errant Pepperdine pickoff attempt. USC had just four hits in the game. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
“I’m very competitive. I don’t care how we win,” USC coach Chad Kreuter said. “It makes me sick being a .500 team, hovering around and not getting over the hump.”
In the fifth inning, Pepperdine starter Aaron Gates threw strikes to the plate but had problems throwing to the bases. Gates struck out the side but had two crucial errors.
Freshman Adam Landecker started the inning with a double down the right field line and scored when junior infielder Joe De Pinto’s sacrifice bunt attempt ended up in right field.
When Gates fielded the bunt, wheeled and fired to first base, his throw ran second baseman Joe Given into the baseline. De Pinto appeared to step on Given’s arm as he went down to catch the ball and caught Given in the face with his knee brace, which resulted in the players tumbling over each other and the ball finding its way into the outfield.
De Pinto promptly stole second base and then scored when Gates had De Pinto picked off second base but threw the ball into center, allowing USC (11-10) to take a 3-0 lead.
Pepperdine (6-13) tried to rally in the eighth inning off junior reliever Chris Mezger. Outfielder Brian Humphries laced Mezger’s first pitch over the right field fence for a home run, and infielder Torrey Jacoby took Humphries lead, hitting a mammoth home run to left-centerfield that bounced off the top of a tree beyond the 375-mark atop the fence.
But Mezger buckled down to get the final out of the eighth inning and eventually got the win.
“It’s about keeping an even keel,” Mezger said. “You don’t want to get too high or too low.”
Senior Shuhei Fujiya came on in the ninth and pitched a perfect final frame to collect his first save as a Trojan.
Starter sophomore Chad Smith went four innings, allowing only two hits and striking out five, but was removed in the fifth inning after pitching in relief Saturday and having tightness around his elbow.
USC took an early lead in the fourth inning, making the most of Pepperdine’s first error. Sophomore infielder Matt Foat led off the inning with a Baltimore chop that bounded over the head of the third baseman for a single.
Gates jammed sophomore outfielder Alex Sherrod with an inside pitch, forcing him to hit it weakly to first base for what had the potential to become a double play; but instead Jacoby booted the ball allowing both runners to be safe.
After sacrifice bunt from freshman infielder Cade Kreuter, junior infielder Matt Hart drove in Foat with a ground ball to third base.

Regarding Dr. Finkelstein
The news article published March 11 in the Daily Trojan under the title, “USG-funded speaker event draws criticism,” was a misleading piece of journalism rife with bias against USG-funded guest speaker Dr. Norman Finkelstein, whom Students for Justice in Palestine hosted for a speech that night.
The topic of Finkelstein’s lecture was the Israeli invasion of the Gaza strip last year, and he focused on discussing and affirming the findings of the subsequent investigations by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that found evidence of pervasive and systematic crimes against humanity by Israeli soldiers in what Finkelstein deems a “massacre.”
However, the article published by the Daily Trojan showed no indication of this. Instead, it published outrageous claims that Dr. Finkelstein is “said to be a Holocaust-denier” and asserted through a student’s quote that Dr. Finkelstein is supportive of killing any Israeli civilian.
Dr. Finkelstein’s entire family went through the Nazi Holocaust, and he has never denied that it occurred. While it is true that he is “said to be Holocaust denier” by a select, radical few that wish to defame him, this statement is patently false, and for the Daily Trojan to publish such a disgusting allegation is poor journalism. Holocaust denial is not subjective — Dr. Norman Finkelstein is not a Holocaust-denier, and for ’SC Students for Israel and College Republicans to blatantly lie about a man who lost so much of his family in the Holocaust is morally repugnant.
Additionally, Shanel Melamed’s comment that Dr. Finkelstein “say[s] that it’s OK for me to be killed” is blatantly untrue and a very obvious attempt to defame a man who has never made any comment in the past that he is somehow “OK” with just killing innocent Israeli civilians, as the quote suggests. To publish such an outrageous and false assertion by a student as if it had any basis in reality is in truly poor taste.
We are also rather shocked at the complete lack of even a semblance of neutrality. Marwa Katbi, SJP’s Vice President, was asked by the Daily Trojan reporter what she thought of the claims that Finkelstein is anti-Semitic and expressed that Finkelstein does not hold anti-Semitic views, adding that any insinuation otherwise is a bogus claim. She continued to say that slamming Finkelstein with a baseless charge of anti-Semitism was an attempt to silence his honest criticism of Israel, and a drew away from the main issue of Thursday night’s lecture, which she stated was the massive human rights abuses committed by the state of Israel.
Running this quote alongside the opposing claims would have been the proper way to balance a news article about our event. To be in the possession of such a quote and not to have printed it strikes us at best as convenient censorship and at worst as willful propaganda.
We hope the Daily Trojan will in the future reconsider publishing statements like those above that serve to defame USG-funded speakers, and our club, with baseless accusations.
USC Students for Justice in Palestine
I’m wondering why people are so quick to label Dr. Finkelstein as a fraud (multiple times in the comments), or hateful person without offering any validation.  I’m certainly open to that argument, but there’s nothing that I’ve seen that indicates that he actually is a fraud.  Does he speak untruthfully, cite lies, misquote, or present inaccurate realities?  Or is it that he just makes conclusions that make us uncomfortable, that we don’t agree with, or that we have a hard time believing because they are scary?  From what I’ve seen of the guy, he doesn’t make up histories or deny that they occurred, and he cites his sources.  So, if we’re labeling him anything other than Doctor (he received his doctorate from Princeton University’s Department of Politics), please, let’s see some real reasons why, or its just more malicious slander.
anyone catch Martin Sherman’s lecture on Islam and Israel on Thursday? It was the biggest load of unacademic crap and blatant islamophobia i’ve seen usc pay for in a while.
the usc college republicans and students for israel are from the same lying, immoral group as that sleazebag. props to SJP for fighting this
Ahh shut your mouth.  Anyone who doesnt support your position is automatically crap.  Learn to respect other peoples positions, especially when they are right.   Until you recognize that there are terrible things done in the name of Islam and condemn it for what it is, youre going to be on the fringe.  May Israel defend itself now and forever, from an Indian friend who has seen the same types of attacks in his country!
hahaha
i do respect other peoples’ opinions, and condemn terrorism- IN ALL ITS FORMS, including STATE SPONSORED TERRORISM. For me, this is the real danger, as it is uncotnrolled and backed up armies and lots of cash. the US Invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent 100,000s of innocent Iraqi deaths, is terrorism.
i like how you say “shut your mouth,” while telling me to respect other opinions.
ISLAMOPHOBIA and racism are different from legitimate criticism of policy.
My original post condemned the newspaper and the students it quoted for being completely wrong and thus maliciously attacking the integrity of a man and the organization that sponsored him.  As I said, that is slander, plain and simple.  Those students and the newspaper should be held accountable.  So thank you SJP for defending your voice with this letter to the editor.
Since then some other people here have turned this into a snowballing argument about the Middle East issue.  I have already bitten on your provocation, and I won’t do it again.  It didn’t take long for me to be inaccurately labeled as an Anti-Semite–that token term that gets handed out like Halloween candy to anyone who questions Israel’s illegal actions and racist policies.  Send me the proverbial friend request if you want to talk about Palestine-Israel, but that’s not what I was talking about here originally.
haha yes youre so right! When people attack you and blow themselves up in your cities, just chill.  It will go away somehow. There arent really people who want to kill you for religious or territorial reasons.  
Rolling my eyes
Norman Finklestein=destructive, dishonest, scummy little human being parading under the banner of academia=complete nonsense
Please stop and take a look at this debate. None of us believes human rights violations, including killing of anyone, is ok. Could we respectfully consider the notion that each of us believes in the same principles and is working towards the same goal of peace? Anyone thoughtfully considering fact as objectively as possible (such as Dr. Finklestein) should be given our respect at the very least, regardless of his followers, or his opponents.
It would be nice to think that, wouldn’t it? Unfortunately, there are bad people in the world, and it is necessary for good people to defeat them — on the battleground of ideas if possible, on the battleground of battle otherwise. Thankfully, Israel has shown the resolve to defend itself in both arenas.
How narrow-minded is your world view? If you are so naive to think that this is a battle of good versus evil, I am genuinely appalled that you are going to graduate with a degree from any university. Please take yourself out of the TV-world that you live in, learn a little about putting yourself in another person’s shoes, and then join the debate to contribute something meaningful.
Do you deny the existence of evil? If your whole philosophy is based on the principle that every person, every ideology, every act is morally equivalent, then you have some hard growing-up left to do. People who would strap bombs onto their own children for the sake of murdering innocents are not morally equivalent to soldiers who would risk their lives to protect their children. Activists working to undermine Israel’s right to self-defense are not “equally right” to those who support that right. And no, it doesn’t matter if they have “good intentions”. Wrong is not right. Words have meanings. Terrorists are not freedom fighters. Certainly evil people can have their minds changed (see “battleground of ideas” above), but we’re all safer when the good guys have more and better guns.
Okay so IDF soldiers who shoot unarmed palestinians are morally justified. Glad I have heard your point of view.
No jack thats not what he’s saying.  That is obviously a horrible tragedy and if the incident was as you say than those soldiers are obviously not morally justified.  But when you say phrases like “IDF soldiers who shoot unarmed palestinians” , those kinds of accusations are often grossly wrong.  So many times you hear that Palestinians are killed, but the real story is not told.  Were they in the crossfires when the IDF was attacked? Were they being used as human shields?  Were the unarmed civilians among people who were attacking Israeli forces?
I remember reading a report once that said 25 Palestinians had died in an explosion late at night, and Hamas and others accused Israel of bombing civilian homes.  Turns out the incident was that a device went off in a bomb manufacturing factory in gaza and the 25 people there or around it were killed when munitions exploded.  
Way too often Israel is blamed when Palestinian civilians are killed and it is actually the fault of the terrorists who use palestinians to their advantage
I think what he means is that people who declare that they want to destroy Israel and act towards that goal without any regard for human life even on their own side can be considered evil.  And its really not necessary to insult someone for being in college if you dont agree with their views… haha
“That is obviously a horrible tragedy and if the incident was as you say than those soldiers are obviously not morally justified”
Well… now take that logic… and apply it… to other examples… which there are a myriad of…
“So many times you hear that Palestinians are killed, but the real story is not told. Were they in the crossfires when the IDF was attacked? Were they being used as human shields? Were the unarmed civilians among people who were attacking Israeli forces?”
Very clear reason why the “real story” is never told. Operation Cast Lead is an outstanding example. Israel invades Gaza but bans reporters. They refuse to do a decent internal investigation after international groups all have substantial reports of numerous human rights violations. They didn’t let reporters in because of what happened during the Second Lebanon War when their atrocities were reported numerous times.
This is all very easy to read up and discover. Your excuse sounds like some generic CNN comment.
I wonder how many of those here lambasting Dr. Finkelstein and his supporters actually attended his presentation.  If they had they would have been given the first opportunity to challenge him on any of his statements; either from the evening’s lecture or elsewhere. Sitting in the audience a few rows behind me were Israel supporters who (I’m speculating) took issue with some of Dr. Finkelstein’s positions. They wore name badges with “TRUTH” written on them. They walked out in unison at the end of Dr. Finkelstein’s talk (save one or two). Of this group, only one student asked questions (to the best of my recollection). He went first and was allowed multiple questions of which Dr. Finkelstein addressed each and every point (he also praised the student for taking an opposing view in front of an audience largely sympathetic to Dr. Finkelstein’s views). Dr. Finkelstein then suggested that some of the other people waiting have an opportunity and that he would return to the student for further questions at the end if he wished (which he declined when the time came).
Sadly, what I see here is a rehash of so many of the same discredited arguments (if not outright personal attacks). All would have had the chance to directly face the object of their ire and challenge him on any point of fact they chose. This is the third time I’ve seen Dr. Finkelstein speak to a university audience and he is remarkably consistent. Detractors are given the courtesy to go first in line for questions, and he does not shy away from any of them, or the statements or presumptions included with the questions. 
From my perspective, the frustration apparent is the inability to counter his points, rather than the claim he is putting forth a false representation.
I have seen Finklestein speak before, and have read many of his books. Its very naive to think that those who criticize him don’t know what they’re talking about or haven’t done their homework. I am very well educated on the matter.
And it is too bad that this same courtesy is not shown by many who support Finklestein and his ideas toward people on the other side of the issue.  For example, just recently the Israeli Ambassador to the United States was at UC Irvine giving a speech but was not able to finish because Palestinian supporting students in the audeince repeatedly stood up and started yelling free palestine nonsense until people gave up.  This has not been a rare occurence on campuses throughout the US, but I have no heard of a time when supporters of Israel interrupted a speaker so many times that he was forced to give up, much less an ambassador to the US.
I’ve seen him speak before.  The guys a delussional idiot
I don’t know how else you qualify shooting 4 teenagers in one weekend.
Jack, you are my hero. The end.
Wait what event are you referring to?
israel killed 4 palestinian protestors last weekend. so much for free speech.
And rockets have again been flying into Israel recently, killing civilians, and several Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past couple weeks as well. 
If you are going to report the news, report all of it, not the segments that you want to use to support your cause.  Thank you
I dont know about this specific incident, but the real difference is that one side (namely Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups) has the expressed attempt to kill the other side no matter if it is a soldier or a man, woman, or child, and on the other side Israel does everything it can to avoid civilian casualties.  If Israel had dropped its weapons at any time in the past 60 years, it would have been attacked and destroyed. If terrorist groups around Israel had dropped their weapons, there would have been peace.  We cant keep justifying terrorist groups who advocate terror by saying its because of the other side or their circumstances…they are in those circumstances because of their actions and outside forces wanting to harm Israel more than establish peace.
Oh my god you people are awful. The article you complain about only said that Finkeldink was “said to be” a Holocaust denier. In the same text, it accused Israel of racism and murder, without and qualification like “said to be”. Do you interpret anything less than a call for a new Holocaust to be “pro-Israel bias”? Clearly the DT is biased in favor of your anti-semitic views… if not, why would they print your Letter which is just a rehashing of what you wrote in the comments on the earlier thread? Accusing them of a pro-Israel bias (heaven forbid such a thing!) is clearly dishonest and disingenuous on your part.
Right, Joe.  It is said that Finkelstein is a holocaust denier, which is a statement that is wrong. Finkelstein is on record speaking very clearly about his own family’s persecution during the Holocaust. The Daily Trojan failed to point that out, and thus it legitimized a lie. Sure, the editors posted the correction to the article online, but since it was the crux of argument opposing his campus appearance, the Daily Trojan should have checked if those claims were legitimate in order to ask whether or not to write the article in the first place.  Otherwise it’s no better than tabloid fodder.
You are also right that the article stated that he accuses Israel of racist policies, which is something I think he would not dispute, but I can’t say for sure.  So, to the best of my knowledge, this is accurate reporting.
The paper published slanderous statements that deliberately attacked another’s character, and that is very serious. People can go to court for that type of offense. Once is enough, but the author solidified the sentiment repeatedly by quoting Lauren Korbatov who equated Finkelstein to a person who denies slavery ever occurred, and Melamed at the end of the article, who feared that he intended to hurt her for some reason.  Each time the article failed to point out that these students’ accusations were false in the most basic sense of the word.
Lastly, HOW DARE you accuse me of harboring anti-Semitic views, as that was no part of my statement. DO NOT accuse me of anti-Semitism. If you intend to accuse me of hating Jewish people, I do not.  Furthermore, I am part Arab–A descendent of a people from the Near East called Semites. I do not hate myself.
Umm in case you didn’t realize, the term anti-Semite doesn’t carry the literal meaning of semite anymore…..its definition deals specifically bigotry and hatred against Jews.  
As for everything else, I just don’t understand why you are so concerned with defending this man Finklestein…I’m very curious how passionately you would defend someone who does not support your position of the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  Indeed, I am very curious.  
And although the writers of the article may not have completely accurately described Finklestein when it called him a “Holocaust denier”, he defenitely deserves much blame and condemnation for minimalizing the Holocaust and pretending that it was somehow exagerated for political purposes.  For example, he once posed how it was possible that so many people died in the Holocaust if there are so many survivors…..  That’s like asking how it was possible that thousands of people died when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima if there are so many people with radiation poisoning from it…  
No matter his familiar ties to the Holocaust, the man has done great injustices to the issue and insulted those who lived through it by pretending like it was an exagerated account made up for political purposes instead of the greatest instance of human cruelty in the history of mankind.
Again, I am extremely curious how you would defend this man or others like him from “misinformation” if he did stand on the same side as your views and opinions.  I look forward to seeing your outraged and passionate comments on future articles in which pro-Israel figures are misportrayed by the media.
I disagree with the inaccurate usage of the term anti-Semitism, but that is irrelevant. If it refers to a hatred or bigotry targeted against Jews specifically I am still appalled to have been labeled as such, because it is simply, AGAIN, not true (I’m sensing a theme here).
To everything else…
I would hope that ANY article published by the Daily Trojan contains statements that are factually based. And I would not advocate for the misrepresentation of anyone on the other side of the issue, or do so myself. I don’t see why you would even question that. This isn’t about me defending Finkelstein. I disagree with the manner in which this man was represented by the Daily Trojan and the students who spoke out against him because it was entirely inaccurate. That is all I mean.  I’m steamed about this because using deliberate misinformation and scare tactics are the greatest disservice to this or any political debate. I think you would agree. So, yes, I am passionate about this. And no, I don’t feel that my stance on the issue (though it’s clear) matters in the context of my arguments.
Whatever the article concluded about Dr. Finkelstein should have been factual. If he has stated that the memory of the Holocaust has been exploited for political gain, then that is a theory that is the right of an educated political scientist to make.  That is what political scientists do. His theory should be presented as such, whether or not any of us think it is reasonable. It should not be twisted into an inaccurate representation of his views. The Daily Trojan and the students the article quoted have done that. He is not a Holocaust denier as the article mentioned, nor has he expressed even the shadow of intention to physically harm any student at this university.  Theorizing about the manner in which the Nazi Holocaust has shaped world politics is not the same as denying it ever occurred.
I’m done.
haha your statement “theorizing about the manner in which the Nazi Holocaust has shaped world politics is not the same as denying it ever occured” must be a euphemism for “theorizing that the Holocaust really wasnt so bad and was totally exagerated so that it could be used for selfish reasons is fine cuz its not as crazy as denying it outright”
I am now going to go theorize that slavery really wasn’t so bad as people think and African Americans have disgracefuly exagerated it and used it for political purposes.    
No one is saying that Finklestein doesn’t have the right to make his absurd claims but that doesnt mean we cant refute and condemn his dishonesty.
Rami, anti-semitism doesn’t mean “hate” in your heart, it means bigotry in the world. I don’t give a rat’s you-know-what whether you:
(a) hate the Jews
(b) are enamored of a handsome liberal professor who hates the Jews
(c) believe that murdering Jews will get you into heaven
(c) have convinced yourselves that you’re unbiased, but the Jews happen to be evil
(d) are trying to impress a hippie chick
(e) don’t know the facts, and are parroting something you heard a celebrity say
All I need to know to call you an anti-semite is that you are intently, actively, working to spread lies (“racism”, “murder”) about Israel, spread hatred of the Jewish people, trying to undermine Israel’s right to exist and to defend itself, and using lies to defend another anti-semite. You are working for anti-semitic ends. You don’t get “points” for having good intentions.
Its no surprise to me that the Daily Trojan would print an article full of lies regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and specially the people which speak on behalf of the Palestinian people. As a former SJP member from 2004 to 2008 I have found many such biased articles printed by the staff of the Daily Trojan and time and again we have had to write letters back expressing our outrage.  
Its time the staff and editors start doing their part in writing balanced and well researched pieces that reflect the real situation in the middle east as is being done by reputable organizations like the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. 
This is not only a problem that affects the USC campus, but also on a national scale.  The lack of news sources that will speak the truth regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is staggering and this problem greatly contributes to the fact that human rights abuses in Gaza and other territories continue to go unnoticed! 
Stop selling propaganda to USC students! Its no wonder that alternative news sources to the Daily Trojan have been printed in past years. There has historically been a lack of balanced writing coming from the Daily Trojan and thats just plain bad journalism!
Thank you for following up, SJP.  This lack of diligent, dutiful reporting and disregard for the most basic tenets of journalism has been a noticeable theme in articles published by the Daily Trojan.  I’m not accusing the entire organization.  I know you try, and I know you’re students.  But these are more than simple misgivings I have.  The article quoted students making slanderous and biased quotations that attacked Finkelstein’s philosophies and previous statements.  As SJP has stated here, these accusations were just plain false. This is far more serious than an error in the sports section on the back page.  This is especially true when dealing with the highly contentious Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where misinformation abounds.
It is despicable to publish accusations about “what is said” of a person, while ignoring or giving no allusion to what that person actually says.  Shouldn’t someone check to see if ‘what is said’ of a person is actually true?  Failure to do so makes you no more credible than the ridiculous tabloids I scoff at every time I check out at the grocery store.  For a student reporter and editor trying to build credibility, the Finkelstein article from March 10 was a serious blow to that goal.  As much as I’d like to accuse the Daily Trojan of deliberately spinning this article, I will refrain, and hope that as students you learn about the repercussions poor reporting.
Fighting misinformation is the utmost tenet of your aspired profession.  LIVE BY IT. Truthful, even-handed reporting is the most basic of your ethical responsibilities as journalists, and the article published on March 10 about Mr. Finkelstein showed a clear disregard for that.
Ok Rami who is so concerned with truth.
TRUTH-  the only reason SJP is defending the fraud Finklestein is because he supports their anti-Israel sentiment. Its got nothing to do with honest reporting or character defamation.  It’s the same old Israel-hating nonsense. 
You really think otherwise?  Give up the act.
Great letter! Hopefully the DT will learn from it’s atrocious mistake with that article and actually start reporting and doing researching. The fact that Finkelstein’s parents survived the Holocaust is even listed on his Wikipedia…it is not exactly difficult to figure out that those allegations about him were just plain false.
Yes! Let us always support anti-Israel speakers for political purposes!!!  The fact that he had family in the Holocaust makes it fine for him to say whatever he wants!!!!
Give me a break…..
What’s wrong with supporting anti-Israel speakers for political purposes? Seems fine to me. In the US we question Cuba’s policies, Venezuela’s, and China’s policies. I don’t see a difference in Dr. Finkelstein’s right to do that to Israel?
Here’s why….because it is part of a larger attack on Israel that is characterized by a DOUBLE STANDARD and DISPROPORTIONATE condemnation and attack of Israel. 
Think of all the academics and “intellectuals” like Finklestein who attack Israel relentlessly.  Think about the wider international community (particularly in the UN) where Israel is condemned and condemned in the harshest manner a thousand times before a countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan, whose human rights abuses rage a thousand times greater than anything Israel has ever come close to doing, are even given a slap on the wrist or asked to politely stop. 
Btw equating those countries you mentioned with Israel is an extremely unfair assesment.  You named three countries that range from dictatorial to repressive to closed socities and more… in contrast to the open society and only democracy in the entire middle east (this does not mean it has no problems or faults of its own).  
And even if people were to buy the claim that questioning policies of repressive regimes is somehow on the same level as criticizing israel, where on college campuses do we see constant attacking of any of these countries like we do with Israel?  This charade is getting really old….
Just because something is disproportionately portrayed does not mean that it makes their actions any more right or justified. 
I don’t know what media you see, but I think the clash is coming from how one-sided this debate is shown on our news system and how ignorant that makes our general population. Everyone has a sense about the terrible things happening in Sudan and China and why they are occurring. Having speakers “speak out” against the atrocities in Sudan seems redundant when (mostly) everyone knows about it and generally are against it. Instead, we have informational booths, bake sales, and movie screenings to raise awareness that everyone is happy to support and attend.
Not everyone knows about the Israel-Palestine conflict’s causes or how the US taxpayer is funding it. I would say Americans have a bigger hand in that cookie jar, giving us a larger responsibility for continuing that conflict when the majority of us do not know about it. Therefore, college campuses in America would naturally have more speakers about political events that are happening on our dime in order to educate rather than to raise awareness about something already supported. 
(And if Israel is condemned a thousand times harsher than other countries, it could be 1) because they’re doing something really bad or 2) because they boast a more Westernized lifestyle by destroying their neighbors, which is something generally the have’s shouldn’t do to the have-not’s)
Here’s whats wrong….its all part of a larger anti-Israel sentiment that attacks Israel with a DOUBLE STANDARD and DISPROPORTIONATELY.  This is most clearly seen in the international community (especially in the UN) where Israel is condemned and condemned a thousand times in the harshest of terms  before countries like China, Sudan, Egypt, Saudia Arabia, and Syria, which commit acts of violence and repression a thousand times greater than anything Israel has ever come close to, are even given a slap on the wrist or politely asked to stop!!
And your comparison between questioning the actions of those countries versus Israel is extremely unfair.  The three countries you mentioned are dictatorial to repressive to closed societies while Israel is an open society and the only democracy in the entire middle east (no, this does not mean it has no problems or faults of its own, but it puts in on a level a whole lot better than you give credit).
Even if you could equate the US questioning dictatorial and repressive regimes with attacking Israel, then why does Israel get attacked and chewed out so much more than any other country on college campuses? Shouldnt the worst conflicts and abuses be getting the most attention or at least equal attention? The day I see one anti-Cuba speaker, one anti-China speaker, one anti-Saudi Arabia speaker, one anti-Algeria speaker, and one anti-Syria speaker for every anti-Israel speaker is the day i’ll believe its actually a genuine human rights issue and not a malicious and disproportionate attack on Israel.
  Give up the charade already…
An illegal blockade is an illegal blockade. Stop trying to muffle criticism because it’s “unfair”. $3 billion of U.S. foreign aid and billions in military hardware go there every year. Does the same apply to Algeria? Are American citizens being killed because of the government’s support of Sudan? 
When a country starts 2 wars in 3 years, I don’t care who they are, they deserve criticism. When a country commits an illegal blockade and starves a population before, during, and after killing 1300 members of that community, I don’t care who they are, they deserve criticism.
Alison,
You’re right, an injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.  However, the fact that it is such disproportionate attack is testament, a sign, an indication of something greater, of a greater political motivation that simply fighting for human rights or an end to conflict.  That is why I question it.  If you are so passionate and aggressive in condemning Israel for the civilians killed who you believe died because of Israel’s actions, why are you not as aggressive in criticizing Sudan when literally hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered and raped in ethnic cleansing.  But rarely ever do we see as angry and persistent demonstration against Sudan, or China, or Saudi Arabia, or Algeria, or Zimbabwe, or a slate of other countries that commit attrocities that make the Israeli-Palestinian conflict pale in comparison.  
So yes, when you see that the vast majority of UN resolutions are solely against Israel, you would think that its because it must be doing something “really bad”, but the reality is that its all political and the same old Israel bashing that has been around for decades.  
And god bless America for supporting Israel in the face of so many ill wishers and people who would like to see Israel ended.  I am not even Jewish but I will never stop supporting Israel.
Jessica,
Don’t rank, or assign some arbitrary value to human suffering. That is a level to which I will not stoop.  I’m not playing that game with you.
In regards to democracies in the Middle East, last I checked Lebanon uses a democratic form of government, and a few others.  So again, that arguments is wrong.  And we say we went to Iraq to save them and install our white horse democracy there (we see how well that is working).  Besides that, let’s not forget that democracy isn’t always peachy.  It can be used to violate the rights of the minority.  We in the US have firsthand experience of that.  
But in relation to Israel this opens a whole new bag of tricks that isn’t appropriate to get into here.  That was not my argument in my post for this article.  If you want to talk to me further about the host of UN resolutions that Israel has ignored, read my post below and contact me separately.  Please.
Sorry for the double post I thought the first time did not go up
Yes Jack we also give 3 billion dollars in assistance every year to Egypt, as well as Saudi Arabia and a slew of other countries in the Middle East. Learn a little first before you ramble.
And I think you got it wrong…when a country gets attacked on regular intervals through massive conventional wars as well as terrorist proxy wars since 1948, it is remarkable that it is still an open and free society that values human rights.  Perhaps we should be outraged at groups like Hamas for instigating wars and hiding behind civilians to increase collateral damage and score media points.  Let’s remember that every time Palestinian civilians are killed, Hamas wins.
Jessica,
I feel like you are deluded as to who and why people are criticized.
There are sanctions on Sudan, and a trade blockade. Same with Syria. and Iran. What more would you like?
There is no real conflict regarding Algeria’s government right now, I’m not sure what you think you’re talking about.
The reason we target Israel is because the US gives $3 billion a year, mostly in military aid, to the country! These are OUR tax dollars. I also object to the money given to Egypt- but this is mostly civilian aid, and it is only given because of the Egyptian government’s stance on Israel.
I focus on Israel because it is a human rights abuser, and it uses our taxes to do so. The fact that Israel has an open press is the biggest shame about the matter- in other democracies, OPEN DEBATE leads people to OPPOSE SLAUGHTER. in Israel, open debate leads people to SUPPORT SLAUGHTER, OCCUPATION, and APARTHEID. In Sudan if people oppose genocide they can’t speak up- the same in other places. But in Israel people actively support brutality!!!! Absolutely shameful!!
“Yes Jack we also give 3 billion dollars in assistance every year to Egypt, as well as Saudi Arabia and a slew of other countries in the Middle East. Learn a little first before you ramble.”
Never said the United States didn’t. You clearly ignored all other points of my post though, which is hardly “rambling”.
“And I think you got it wrong…when a country gets attacked on regular intervals through massive conventional wars as well as terrorist proxy wars since 1948, it is remarkable that it is still an open and free society that values human rights.”
Do these human rights include illegal human blockades, routine breaking of sound barriers, not letting scholars leave Occupied Territories, and banning Arab parties in election? Read the U.S. State Department annual report on Human Rights in the Occupied Territories… that’ll explain so called “freedom and democracy” which applies to a select # of group. And that still doesn’t justify the killing of 1300 people. If the United States was a democracy in the 19th century, does that justify the genocide of Native Americans? Britain was a “democracy”, does that justify colonization in Africa and Asia? 
“Let’s remember that every time Palestinian civilians are killed, Hamas wins.”
I don’t even know to analyze that statement. So the 4 Palestinian, unarmed teenagers killed this past weekend? That was justified? Under what grounds?
O my god, he’s on wikipedia! He must be legit! 
 Finklestein is a hateful fraud, regardless of if he is on wikipedia or not
hahaha

Every spring thousands of musicians and music industry professionals forgo the typical spring break vacations of beaches and relaxation for five days of non-stop networking, live performances and barbecue in Austin, Texas for the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference.
Lo-fi · Piper Kaplan, part of the two-piece Los Angeles-based band Pearl Harbor, performs in Austin along with many other local acts. - Katrina Bouza | Daily Trojan 
South by Southwest — more commonly referred to as SXSW — is part of a larger contingent of entertainment and business-oriented conferences that also include a film and interactive technology component. The festival brings together all facets of the music business, both independent and corporate, together for industry panels during the day and live performances at night.
While nearly all musical genres are represented at SXSW, the festival and conference are known for the large number of indie bands that descend on Austin hoping to find their big break. In years past, bands such as Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand were discovered at the festival.
As such, bloggers and indie record executives flood the streets of Downtown Austin hoping to find the next buzzworthy band of the indie world.
Quite unexpectedly, however, most of the season’s biggest buzz bands failed to impress the slew of industry professionals that rushed to catch the packed performances. Groups such as Dum Dum Girls, Best Coast and Toro Y Moi elicited more yawns than applause throughout the week.
The topic of disappointing new talent even arose in several of the morning panels; Christopher Weingarten, a music journalist most famous for his 1,000 album reviews via Twitter, commented multiple times that he found West Palm Beach-based surf rock revivalists Surfer Blood “extremely boring.”
In fact, some of SXSW’s best performances came from the most unexpected of places.
Amid the slew of much-lauded bands on the Sub Pop showcase lineup, the newly-signed Happy Birthday stole the show with an infectious set of grunge-tinged pop while Los Angeles-bred Avi Buffalo — whose members recently graduated from high school — displayed a far more refined and developed style than would be expected from a group so new to the underground music scene.
In addition to Avi Buffalo, hundreds of other Los Angeles-based groups played performances throughout the duration of SXSW; bands such as Pearl Harbor, Wounded Lion, the Entrance Band, Fool’s Gold and Pocahaunted peppered multiple party and showcase lineups while No Age surprised longtime fans by playing sets comprised almost entirely of new material from their upcoming album.
One of the most talked about performances before SXSW began was the highly-anticipated return of Courtney Love, fronting a new incarnation of her 1990s alt-rock band Hole.
Although the featured performers differed significantly from the classic Hole lineup, Love’s performance at Stubb’s BBQ for Spin Magazine’s 25th anniversary show marked the band’s first U.S. performance in 10 years.
Playing to a packed house — and to an even larger crowd of those not lucky enough to receive passes to the showcase crowded around the venue — Love blazed through several of her most well-known Hole tracks (“Miss World,” “Violet”) while focusing primarily on new material from the band’s upcoming album, Nobody’s Daughter.
Despite reading lyrics from an onstage teleprompter and being completely unable to play her guitar, Love’s stage presence was surprisingly electrifying as she directed the audience to sing along and provided unabashedly crude between-song banter.
The biggest star of SXSW, however, was not an up-and-coming group or a heritage artist, but rather a social networking site.
Throughout the course of the conference, SXSW attendees could be seen frantically updating their Twitter accounts during performances and reading other festival goers’ posts to find out secret lineup additions, what shows were most entertaining, and, of course, where the free beer was.
Even the advertisements and interactive features posted around SXSW urged those in town for the festivities to Tweet to reflect their conference experiences.
Those with badges could stop by the Registrants Lounge for free drinks and access to photo booth-style computers that posted pictures directly to each concertgoer’s Twitter account, while passes to high-profile showcases were given away via the popular site to those who arrived at secret locations in a given amount of time.
While it’s unlikely any new blogworthy discoveries will emerge from SXSW this year, the conference proved that indie music — and the live concert industry — is still very much alive despite talks that the recording industry is dying a slow death.
In fact, if SXSW did reveal anything this year, it proved that music fans are willing to do pretty much anything to show support for bands they love — even if it means traveling to Texas and standing in line for a tiny cup of cheap beer.

There’s certainly no shortage of ways to pitch in when it comes to environmentalism. We’ve all heard the drill: recycle, turn the lights off, get a hybrid, get a Nalgene, and take shorter  showers. And as a freshman living in a dorm without air conditioning, I can think to myself, “Hey, at least we’re saving energy this way.” (Though admittedly, that doesn’t work now that Los Angeles has finally climbed out of its rainy winter.)
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
Whether or not you believe in global warming, most agree that the planet could use a hand. And it hasn’t gone unnoticed that, while USC is in so many ways the “college of the 21st century,” we sadly fall short in our attempts to be eco-friendly.
UCLA, UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley all rank in Grist.org’s Top 20 Green Colleges, while USC was no where to be found. Most grating of all, USC received a C+ grade in 2009’s College Sustainability Report Card, finishing behind UCLA, which boasts not only a comprehensive recycling program but solar-heated water for four residence halls. So if we’re looking for more motivation to decrease our negative impact on the environment, we should probably factor in our pride.
We are trying to lighten the abuse our daily activities inflict on the planet. USC CalPIRG and the new USC Green Office Certification Program are doing their best to draw USC into the ranks of the environmentally friendly universities, many of which are in California (though Colorado University at Boulder is predictably No. 1). The Green Office Certification Program ranks faculty offices in terms of sustainability and makes suggestions for improvement. Additionally, the long-anticipated Ronald Tutor Campus Center will also be the first USC building to be Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified.
But there is one aspect of campus with extensive efforts toward sustainability that has not been so well publicized: food.
USC Hospitality has implemented a number of initiatives, most of them within the residential dining, to downsize our proverbial footprint.
The two main dining halls both incorporate grease recycling, which eliminates waste and provides up to 50,000 pounds of bio-fuel each year. All paper waste is recycled, food is purchased locally when possible, Green-Seal certified cleaning supplies are increasing by the day and food pulpers at Everybody’s Kitchen and Parkside Restaurant convert leftovers into mulch. The absence of dining trays alone conserves over 76,000 gallons of washing water per year.
One of the most tangible methods of waste elimination is USC Hospitality’s introduction in December 2009 of an outreach to Los Angeles Mission, donating excess food to the homeless population of Skid row. This both cuts down on bulky trash and brings fresh food to hungry people — even if it is from EVK.
Personally, I’m a fan of the
farmers market featuring locally grown produce. (In case you lost track of it when it left Shrine Place, you can now find it on University Avenue on Tuesdays.) Six percent of the food available at USC is bought from local providers such as those selling in the market. The ecological perks of farmers markets are seemingly endless; the food is organic, which eliminates the exposure of harmful pesticides to the environment, and locally produced food cuts down on energy expended in transportation and shipping.
Plus, it’s tasty.
It’s encouraging to see such an interest taken in environmentally friendly food, especially in a university setting, where more than 3,600 students crowd into the dining halls everyday. USC, though it left the gate a little late in the race for Most Sustainable University, is beginning to catch up thanks to the comprehensive efforts of departments like Hospitality.
Food preparation is easy to overlook when we consider ways to cut Mother Nature a break. After the basic “buy organic, don’t use styrofoam cups” talk, sustainable cooking often gets lost somewhere between carpooling and turning off the water when you brush your teeth. USC Hospitality has done an admirable job taking strides to ensure that, as the central facilities of our campus becomes greener, the residential dining halls are not left behind.
Who knows, we might even pass up UCLA.

It’s such a refreshing feeling walking into a class taught by a fun, informative professor in a subject I love. There’s a wealth of incredible professors here: those who tell witty jokes, weave entertaining tales of their travels and research or simply amaze students with their sheer prestige and power in the world. I’m sure I’m not alone in going to class and thinking, “I want my professor’s job someday.”
But with the state of the economy, I can’t help but think the response in those professors’ heads is, “Over my dead body.”
One look at all the fliers for Graduate Record Examinations practice tests and Kaplan classes indicate that graduate school is on the minds of hordes of undergraduates. Granted, a significant number of those students are applying to law or medical schools to pursue high-earning professions. It’s a long road for any graduate student. But the difference between a medical student and a humanities student is after years of intense study, research and competitive residency, chances are high that every medical school graduate will be able to practice medicine; the same can’t be said for humanities graduates.
In a recently updated article, Thomas H. Benton of The Chronicle of Higher Education laments this state of academia and advised students to stay away from graduate school in the humanities, arguing that institutional education and the economy exploit students and send them out ragged and unprepared for the real world. Because the majority of graduate humanities students intend to work in academia, Benton argued these students are setting themselves up for heartbreak in a current economic climate that influences universities to restrict their hiring policies, severely limiting the benefits of becoming an adjunct professor and making the odds of getting on the tenure track the same as winning the lottery.
As a student considering graduate study in the humanities, this was a wake-up call. We as students must be able to represent the university as two entities at the same time: one that wants to support study and research and another that wants to make money. Guess which one calls the shots on hiring policies?
Of course, I didn’t just decide to roll over at the sound of bad news. I’m far too stubborn to give up subjects I love. However, I was forced to realize this “love” is exploitable and ensures absolutely nothing. Benton, decrying such sentimentalization of studies that should be preparing students for professional positions, argues such “love” allows for unfair labor policies under the rhetoric, “We don’t need to pay you fairly because you are doing it for love.” He sees the academic labor system working under the motto, “Provide no more costly tenured positions than are needed to keep the graduate students coming and the adjuncts working.”
Benton’s article does not offer tangible alternatives to those students considering graduate study but rather hopes those who do pursue graduate studies despite the obstacles try to transform academia by bridging their subjects to the real world and creating much-needed relevance.
A reported example suggests law enforcement and medical programs should institute more literature into their curriculum to increase aptitudes for compassion and sympathy. It’s these new connections those studying humanities should seek rather than the isolation of academia that produces more graduates than it hires.
It’s entirely OK to be “in love” with a subject and to pursue it for the joy of learning, but we must realize that working for academia is no different than other career ventures; it is just as risky as being an actor or professional athlete.
College might be fun and comfortable, leading many to want to make education a career, but the choice to work in academia cannot and should not be motivated by a desire to remain sheltered from the real world. Some of us may love learning art history or literature, but the economic and academic climate needs us to do more than just regurgitate what we’ve learned back to incoming students.
To change the academic system, we need to be skeptical of and pickier about how the university treats us. They may be welcoming when we’re paying students, but not so much as prospective faculty.
If we humanities majors intend to further our studies, we really should take our school motto to heart: Fight On!
Victor Luo is a junior majoring in English.
I’m not a student of USC, but I love your article. I am a 2004 Sociology grad. Most of my professors pushed grad school, too. My grades were average at best and I thought grad school wouldn’t help with my future aspirations, “manager of something.”
I ended in the i/t field. The first couple of years hurt, no doubt. I worked for around $12 an hour, part time, no benefits, for about 2 years. I then got a much better, full time position paying double what I was making with benefits and retirement. That was going well until just recently. The recession hit pretty hard and I took an early exit.
The reality is there is no magic degree. If you take composure’s advice you’d think that a engineering degree or a math degree is only way to go with. I know plenty of unemployed and unhappy engineers. Then I know lots of happy engineers, too. The difference? The love (with dedicated that comes with it).
For you, finish your English degree. Take a few years off and enter the job field. Most English majors tend to go into technical writing or public relations. Never forgot your career aspirations, though. If you want to work in academia, volunteer for a professor while gainfully employed.
Take that article with a grain of salt and work on a backup plan. What if you don’t make it as a rock-star professor? Can you write documentation, speak to engineers, deliver a marketing report, or do someone’s taxes? Lots of potential there in the private sector if you can be flexible and work hard at it.
In closing we are much too wrapped up on degrees and titles. In the real world you are what you make of yourself. No one is going to hold your hand and say, “This is what you should do today.”
I didn’t mean to sound so 1-dimensional. Yeah, my friend’s fiance who’s a grad student (computer science major) at that school across town isn’t faring so well in the job market. And yes, I hate to say this, but UCLA’s grad school is more prestigious than SC’s. But even with his UCLA computer science grad school degree, he’s not geting any responses from any of his resume submissions. I don’t care if you came out of Harvard, if your degree isn’t in demand in this dismal economy, then you’re going to be unemployed for some time. 
I agree with you, it’s a pyrrhic victory to get to wrapped up into degrees, the prestige of which school you attended, titles, etc.
There’s a good reason your parents implore you to pursue the highly competitive and rigorous academic endeavors such as pre-med, engineering (not social engineering), computer science and the likes. It’s not just about the titular prestige of “M.D.” etc. It’s because majors that are based on structured disciplines such as mathematics and natural sciences are what enable cancer treatment, surgery, space shuttles to fly into space, sophisticated computer programs, etc. These are the things that make the world go round.
You can waste your time and believe that grad school will set you apart from an undergraduate degree. A grad school degree is not a sure shot in this uphill economy, especially one in business, law, or humanities. I have friends who are pursuing these now, and even they’re worried about “what’s next?”

On Thursday, March 11 before spring break, when I left my last class of the week to go home and pack, I quickly checked my e-mail. Upon first glance, I thought I received yet another e-mail from Provost C. L. Max Nikias. Instead, the subject line read “C. L. Max Nikias named 11th president of USC.”
I was taken aback by this news: A new president chosen from within the university?
Suddenly, I realized the USC Board of Trustees’ unanimous selection of Provost Nikias to succeed President Sample displayed the final sign of Steven B. Sample’s phenomenal leadership.
Typically presidents of universities are selected from outside the university. Almost all of USC’s 10 presidents prior to Nikias followed this trend. USC President John R. Hubbard was the only person to have become president from the position of vice president and provost — Hubbard had only held that position for one year.
Perhaps, universities choose outsiders for this position because insiders tend to follow the footsteps of recent presidents and could lack a unique vision.
Nick Hamada, a senior majoring in international relations (global business), recalls an alumni event from Sample’s leadership course, The Art and Adventure of Leadership (MDA 365), last fall when a student asked Sample, “What qualities do you want in the next president?”
“I will not answer that because I will inevitably describe myself,” Sample replied. Sample had no vote in the selection of the next president. Presidents have their own flavor and their own initiatives. He did not want someone that would act exactly like him. He wanted the new president to have a vision for USC’s greatness, yet shape his own programs to realize it.
USC’s Presidential Advisory Search Committee unanimously chose Nikias to succeed Sample from a pool of 75 qualified presidents and provosts from around the country and world. He was chosen to be the future leader for the university for his vision.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
Provost Nikias undoubtedly holds qualifications for this position, having established new programs and scholarships at USC, including the Progressive Degree Program and scholarships for global academic immersion. He also quintupled Ph.D. fellowships to $20 million.
He has served USC since 1991 when he initiated development of the center for multimedia research, which later became the award-winning Integrated Multimedia Systems Center. Nikias served his entire Trojan career under President Sample’s leadership and became Provost in 2005.
Under normal circumstances, an incoming  president with 19 years under the leadership of one person would be a curse. Nikias could be a clone of Sample.
But leadership books properly place a great emphasis on the value of mentoring people to lead in one’s stead. A good leader will train a successor to perform even better. This is what leadership guru Jim Collins refers to as level five leadership.
The fact that Nikias embodies a new energy and a fresh and original vision for USC illustrates Sample’s success as a leader. Sample was able to share his platform with the provost — to allow Nikias to stand on his shoulders.
It is likely Nikias will move the Trojan Family, which he proudly embraces, forward by leaps and bounds. He will honor Sample’s legacy while bringing new direction and accelerating the reputation and integrity of USC’s academic community.
The selection of Nikias fully demonstrates what it has meant for Sample to be USC’s leader. It is the perfect honor of his legacy. It is his final encore.
Let us be grateful for President Sample’s phenomenal leadership, particularly as he instilled a culture of dreamers in positions of power. Let us be grateful for our future President Nikias.
Remember: As USC moves up in caliber, we all benefit and will continue to enjoy these benefits as we become alumni.
Jensen Carlsen is a senior majoring in economics and mathematics.  His column “The Bridge” runs Wednesdays.
As a third generation alumnus of the University of Southern California, I am deeply concerned about at least one performance standard of the Sample/Nikias era.  According to the Daily Trojan (Feb. 11, 2010): USC’s endowment was “among the hardest hit in the U.S.” showing a “$1.2 billion loss between July 2008 and June 2009” and “ranked the 8th worst managed endowment by 24/7 Wall St.” Thus, it was on President Sample’s and Provost Nikias’ watch that the University’s endowment took such losses. Given one trustee’s assertion quoted in the LA Times, that Dr. Nikias “is the best possible person to lead our university forward”, I was left to wonder ‘How is that possible?’ If, USC were a public institution; its endowment investment portfolio breakdowns would have had to been made publicly available for review.  I may not have majored in math nor finance, but even I know that doubling such a badly stricken portfolio is not all that heroic a goal; relative either to itself or the asset bases of other universities here and abroad. No wonder then that Dr. Nikias will be emphasizing fund raising. There is a crater in the endowment which will be difficult, if not impossible, to back fill.

Want to play passive-aggressive and keep your hallmates up at night? Crave luscious drinks, savory soups and decadent pâtés? One appliance can deliver them all — your blender.
Whether you are still stuck in a dorm room or have your own kitchen, a blender is an incredibly easy appliance to use and store. For many, a blender is synonymous with smoothies and margaritas. But while the humble blender can certainly create both, if you’re ever ready to totally surrender to the blender, you can create anything from milkshakes to hummus.
The two best blenders on the market are the Vita-Mix and Blendtec, both of which are strong enough to make a smoothie out of a suit of armor. But for making the garden variety zucchini soup, any standard blender will do.
The main difference is the length of time needed to blend, as well as how much can be blended at once. Cheaper blenders sometimes cannot liquefy every little scrap of fiber, but they still come close.
Once you have a blender, the first, obvious use is to create a smoothie. With summer coming, smoothies are starting to look much more appealing. But you needn’t spend your paycheck on Robeks — just whip up a tastier, cheaper smoothie in your room.
Go wild with flavor combinations. Grape, apple and peanut butter are excellent, as are ginger and pear. Use pineapple and coconut oil, and you’ve got a morning friendly piña colada.
Here are a few tips to help you out-juice the Jamba. Frozen fruit, which is cheaper and longer-lasting, makes for a thicker smoothie. For a creamier consistency, add a pinch of xantham gum or guar gum, two natural thickeners found in certain grocery stores. If you do not have the gums, use a banana.
Texture adds dimension and satisfaction to any food, so don’t forget your mix-ins. Adding a few toppings like granola, nuts or cacao nibs enhances the whole smoothie experience. Also, if you know you need to eat more veggies but cringe at the sight of kale, a fruit smoothie is a great way to ninja in some vitamins. Toss in a handful of spinach and you won’t taste it at all.
Finally, if replacing a meal with a smoothie, make sure to add some protein and healthy fats to help you stay full and avoid a sugar crash. A little protein powder, nuts, nut butter or healthy oils — like coconut and flax — all make yummy additions.
The smoothie’s more decadent cousin is the milkshake, which is essentially just ice cream and milk. However, if you’re working on a six-pack for summer, you might not want to be slurping down a pint of Chunky Monkey every night. Luckily, there’s a way to fake it.
If you have protein powder, blend it with milk, ice, fruit, nuts, xantham or guar gum or a banana and spices to get a very respectable mock-up. For recipe ideas, take advantage of the free samples at 21 Choices. Using just vanilla protein powder, a thickener, cinnamon and a handful of dry oatmeal, you can replicate the Oatmeal Cookie. Topping it with sprinkles won’t even cost 95 cents.
But drinkables are only the start of your blending adventures. If you want fresh soup but don’t like slaving over a pot, there are many easy, delicious soups you can make right in your blender. There are slews of recipes across the Internet, but the limit is just what produce you can find at Superior Grocers.
Adding an avocado gives any soup a creamy, bisque-like consistency. Oils and nuts do the same thing. One soup I am particularly fond of is carrot-ginger, which blends with cumin, tahini, lemon juice and cinnamon to make a spicy-sweet side. Just be sure to add in oils at the very end — they work better when drizzled in and act as emulsifiers.
You can warm any soup you make in the microwave, but blenders are especially good for cold soups. When it’s hot out, a chilled cucumber soup is delicious, as is watermelon. You can try your hand at borscht, but don’t be surprised if the Department of Public Safety thinks you’ve murdered someone.
A soup and salad make a great light lunch, and your blender can help with the salad half too. If there’s any Panera dressing you fancy, you can easily mimic it at home. Add your veggies, spices and oils, get things grinding, and add enough water to reach your desired consistency.
Blenders can also churn out awesome spreads, dips, sauces and pâtés. The same guidelines as dressings apply — just use less water. If you’re craving hummus, skip a hike to Ralphs, and grab your blender. The same goes for pesto and baba ganoush. Blending also allows you to get creative: Substitute in some black beans and cumin for a Mexican-inspired hummus, or use pistachios instead of pine nuts for a wonderfully nutty pesto.
If you have some dull leftovers — like a cold, half-eaten sandwich from Submarina California Subs — slapping on a homemade marinara sauce gives you an excellent meal. If a sports game or movie is coming on and friends have decided to crash, it takes no time at all to blend up a tasty dip for your chips. Red peppers, cream cheese and sundried tomatoes work exceptionally well.
For those wanting something a little more gourmet, nut pâtés are great for stuffing into tortillas or topping salads. Blend a cup of nuts with anything from juice to veggies to spices, add just enough water to get it thick and creamy, and you’re instantly a five-star foodie. Nuts can be gross on your wallet, so opt for sunflower seeds to save money. Almonds blended with garlic, curry powder, lemon juice, salt and garam masala makes a very tasty Indian-inspired pâté.
If you’d like a roadmap for some blender action, check out the recipes from websites Epicurious.com or Allrecipes.com, and look for key words such as “blender” and “no cook.” Some people complain they have no time to cook. But preparing awesome food doesn’t mean standing over pots and waiting for oven timers. Just press a few buttons, be sure to close the lid and hope your roommate doesn’t have a headache.

Last weekend, subjects of teen worship Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning starred as the girl-power punk rockers Joan Jett and Cherie Currie of the Runaways. Not only did the duo take on new personalities and wardrobes for the roles, they bravely accepted the responsibility of covering well-known Runaways songs for the soundtrack.
Cherry bomb · The soundtrack features songs by MC5, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop and several Runaways covers from the film’s two main actresses. - Photos courtesy of Atlantic Records  
The soundtrack perfectly encompasses the ’70s feel of the band, featuring not only covers by Stewart and Fanning but also original Runaways tracks and cameos from artists such as the Sex Pistols and Suzi Quatro. The soundtrack successfully relates The Runaways’ story, ranging from other well-known artists to Joan Jett’s solo career.
The journey began with “Cherry Bomb,” a track written spontaneously for Cherie Currie’s lead singer audition. The lyrics scream rebellion and carelessness as Currie proclaims, Hello world / I’m your wild girl / I’m your cherry bomb.
Fanning’s take on the tune infuses the lyrics with a sweeter quality than Currie’s original recording. At first, Fanning’s schoolgirl affectation feels overwrought, but after the first two or three lines, Fanning plunges in and assumes a perfect vocal persona, melding a bit of her own spunky personality with the rebellious timbre of the tune.
Soon enough, the listener can let go of the common representation of Fanning as a rising starlet and see instead the persona of powerhouse teenager she adopted for the film. Though no perfect imitation, she offers a new take on the song and stays true to the feeling of it, unlike covers such as Britney Spears’ rendition of Jett’s “I Love Rock and Roll.”
When it comes to Stewart’s singing, the shift is less dramatic. The duo pair up for another track from The Runaways’ 1970s debut album.
On “Dead End Justice,” Stewart’s characteristically low voice works perfectly for the imitation of rough-sounding Joan Jett. On this track, however, Fanning somewhat overshadows Stewart and shows off her range. Although the lines sometimes sound forced, the actresses both sound as if they made a full effort to adopt the attitude of the era and the girls. On this track, they must speak almost sneeringly, as they state, No more school / Or mommy for me / Stealing cars / And breaking hearts.
Stewart’s tomboy attitude nicely pairs with Dakota’s sweeter tone, and at one point the song includes a scene in which the girls converse in what sounds like a jail cell with sexual, rebellious words and tones.
Of course, today the idea of an all-girl band sounds far from scandalous, but back in the 1970s the rock music scene was mostly, if not entirely, male-dominated. Along with other cover tracks, the album includes some original Runaways tracks to expose new listeners to the persona of the band and allow decade-long fans to relive memories.
“I Wanna Be Where The Boys Are” from The Runaways’ live album, Live in Japan, displays the attitude of the often lingerie-clad Currie. She yells out to the boys in the audience and goes on to sing, I wanna love how the boys love / I wanna be where the boys are.
The song recalls the band’s uniqueness in its attempt to thrive within a predominantly male genre. The live track displays Currie’s voice in all its raw authenticity and honestly showcases the powerful playing of the band’s instrumentalists.
Before forming the band, Jett was fascinated by glam rock artists. To pay due tribute to this formative influence, David Bowie is rightfully represented with a track on the soundtrack.
Albeit a different sound from The Runaways’ hard rock tracks, Bowie’s “Rebel, Rebel” touches on common themes, including parental disapproval. The lyrics tell a story as Bowie speaks to an unknown subject with the words, You’ve got your mother in a whirl / She’s not sure if you’re a boy of a girl. But far from being an admonishment, the track, with its light beat and repeating guitar chords, actually offers some support for the character. Bowie ends the chorus with Hot tramp / I love you so.
Another glam rock artist keeps Bowie company in the album. Nick Gilder’s effeminate and oftentimes sensual voice also tells a story in the tune “Roxy Roller.” The guitar chords sound deeper and more sexual, but no less carefree than “Rebel, Rebel.” Though not as specific, the song also delves into the personality of the character, as Gilder sings of a Flashlight dream / Peaches and cream delight, sometimes giving a high-pitched scream and sometimes a suggestive whisper.
In 1975, 16-year-old Joan Jett decided to pursue her passion and start an all-girl band. The movie attempts to get to the heart of the story, and the soundtrack similarly tries to recreate the mood of the era and the spitfire, all-girl musical movement. The soundtrack definitely will not gain the approval of listeners who are faint of heart when it comes to punk and glam rock but is perfect for The Runaways’ fans — both back in the 1970s and today.
Vastly different from any of the popular tunes currently on iTunes’ top charts, the songs offer unapologetic punk-rock chords and anti-authority lyrics that all seem to summarize the quest for finding a new and true identity. Unlike other soundtracks with artists that write songs to complement the movie, the album goes straight to the essence of The Runaways and similar artists of the time. The album encompasses a genuine love for rock and the artists who transformed and influenced today’s rock music.

Five hours before runners took on the Los Angeles Marathon’s new 26-mile course, another group of local athletes subversively raced the route from Echo Park to Santa Monica.
Organized by infamous Los Angeles bicycle group Wolfpack Hustle, the “L.A. Marathon Crash Race” took advantage of the city’s early-morning street closures and invited area cyclists to take on a uniquely traffic-free course. Though the flyer was initially distributed on underground bike message boards — and the 3 a.m. meet-up time might have dissuaded some — more than 400 cyclists arrived at Tang’s Donut on Sunset Boulevard and Fountain Avenue, ready to take on the 26.1-mile route.
While most of the racers will tell you they were only there to earn the coveted Wolfpack dog tags given as prizes at the end, the event signified yet another level of vigilante urban cycling, one that holds more importance than ever in a city smogged out with car culture.
Despite Los Angeles’ belated entry into two-wheel appreciation, bicycle advocacy groups have already made great strides in our sprawling metropolis, opening co-ops, organizing new rides, hosting tons of themed events and convincing local City Halls to work together on bike master plans.
Somehow forgetting the city’s increased bike friendliness however (or as the official website says, “due to the logistics of the 2010 LA Marathon course”), the Los Angeles Marathon announced that it would not be holding its day-of Bike Tour this year.
Since 2000, cyclists had been treated to 26 miles of car-free streets in a casual ride that traced the closed-off runners course later the same morning. But without it, Los Angeles bike enthusiasts were forced to find their own way to be a part of the marathon festivities.
So, just as riders aim to take back the streets from motorists during monthly Critical Mass rides, Wolfpack Hustle’s “L.A. Marathon Crash Race” injected a heaping dose of bicycle awareness into a day that had been stripped of it.
Full race results will be available in the next few days, but hopefully the message was sent that the urban bike resurgence can not be stopped—even in L.A.

Elusive Hollywood insider Nikki Finke reported on her website, Deadline Hollywood Daily, that Michael Bay has recruited actors John Malkovich and Frances McDormand (the former a two-time Oscar nominee and the latter a proud owner of a golden statuette) to the cast of the third Transformers film, due out in summer 2011.
Before all you Transformers haters pounce on this move, please recognize that Bay is at least trying to promote some semblance of interesting acting into his megabucks action franchise. The presence of undeniably talented stars will hopefully counter the mind-numbingly juvenile dog humping jokes and childish dialogue that plagued the first two films.
Then again, this might just be simple wishful thinking.
The addition of Oscar-caliber talent to the cast continues a popular trend in today’s Hollywood product. We’ve all witnessed this phenomenon before — talented actors resorting to roles in huge spectacles that favor cars, girls and explosions over true acting.
For confirmation of this trend, one only has to look at Stealth, which was Jamie Foxx’s follow-up to Ray, or The Rock, starring the once-mighty Nicholas Cage, or even Adrien Brody’s upcoming role in the newest Predator movie (however, we all remember him more for his famous lip lock with Halle Berry than the performance that won him the award).
The trends of Hollywood star roles are certainly not a new thing. In the 1940s through the 1960s, due to the country’s fascination with travel, Hollywood usually united a leading man/lady with a foreign star to draw in huge audiences (i.e., American movie star Charlton Heston’s pairing with the Italian actress Gabriella Pallotta in the 1962 film, The Pigeon That Took Rome). Today, in accordance with our society’s demand for instant gratification, Hollywood has capitalized not only our preference to “just get to the good part” but also has given it a universal appeal.
The producers of Transformers will attempt to pull off a monumental task in the summer of 2011. Their hiring of Malkovich and McDormand proves their desire to capitalize on the widest possible audience and bring together an older demographic that prefers elitist cinema with a younger demographic that prefers to watch Meagan Fox bare her “talent” onscreen and unite them all under one movie theater roof.
Hey, if it works out McDormand might score her second Oscar win. Then again, that’s just wishful thinking.

According to a recent Modern Language Association’s Job Information List report, the job market for English and foreign language scholars, though still poor, beat out previous forecasts.
Though the MLA report gives hope to graduates with English or foreign language degrees, it also predicts that in 2011 there will be fewer positions in language scholarship than there have been in the past 35 years, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. 
The MLA report predicts that available jobs for those with English degrees will be 27.5 percent lower than those last year; foreign language degree openings are predicted to fall 26.7 percent. Last year, the respective declines were 24.4 and 27 percent. If the predictions are accurate, jobs in both sectors will have declined over 45 percent in two years.
Rosemary G. Feal, the MLA’s executive director, said the reduction in openings was due to uncertain budget. Even though the fields are performing above expectations, Feal does not make any promises.
“It is very much in a state of flux,” Feal told the Chronicle. She explained that potential budgets cuts, as well as appreciating endowments of institutions, cause the current uncertainty.

Gib Arnold, who was a USC men’s basketball assistant coach for five seasons before USC coach Kevin O’Neill fired him earlier this month, has accepted the post of coach at the University of Hawai’i.
Arnold was praised during his time at USC for his recruiting abilities. Named one of Rivals.com’s top-25 recruiters in the country prior to the 2006-2007 season, Arnold was instrumental in recruiting former Trojans DeMar DeRozan and Taj Gibson, among others.
Hawai’i’s athletic director, Jim Donovan, announced Arnold’s selection to a small crowd in Honolulu on Saturday after an extended search to replace former coach Bob Nash, who went 34-56 in three seasons.
Arnold is the son of former Hawai’i coach Frank Arnold and played prep basketball in Honolulu during his high school years.
Prior to joining USC, Arnold had traveled around the country as both an assistant coach and head coach, stopping at Pepperdine, Vanderbilt, Loyola Marymount and Utah Valley State as an assistant coach before taking the head position at Southern Idaho in 2004. Arnold compiled a 57-14 record in two seasons at CSI before accepting the assistant job under then-coach Tim Floyd.
