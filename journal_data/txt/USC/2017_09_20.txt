The No. 21 USC women’s volleyball team will begin its Pac-12 journey on Wednesday against rival No. 11 UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, and the Trojans will be challenged by the Bruins early in their bid to return to the NCAA tournament.  The Trojans regularly face the Bruins twice in conference play, yet they did not manage to defeat the Bruins last year in four- and five-set losses from their two matches.
The Pac-12 conference in Division I women’s volleyball hosts a daunting schedule for all teams involved.  The conference includes the 2016 NCAA National Champion Stanford as well as six additional teams, including the Trojans, who are currently also nationally ranked: No. 7 Washington, No. 8 Oregon, No. 11 UCLA, No. 16 Utah and No. 25 Colorado.
Facing UCLA first is going to build the foundation for the Trojans’ Pac-12 performance, but a loss could be detrimental to the team’s momentum as it follows up this game with a match against the currently unranked Oregon State and Washington State programs prior to meeting No. 7 Washington on Oct. 1 at the Galen Center.
“The game against UCLA will be fun, especially since the team has been preparing for conference to start against our crosstown rival,” junior middle blocker Brittany Welsh said.  “Preseason has been great for us because we have been working through our system to get ready for the Pac-12 competition.”
As they had last season and this season thus far, the Trojan lineup is presumably going to rely heavily on sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier.  This season alone, Lanier has swung on approximately one-third of the Trojans’ overall hitting attempts — compiling 171 kills in the 40 sets she’s played.  UCLA is presumably going to key in on this Trojan tendency and match up larger blockers while focusing on establishing double and triple blocks against Lanier while she’s front row, which actually unlocks many opportunities for the Trojan offense.
Senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley and sophomore setter Cindy Marina, who share setting duties for the Trojans, will be keys to success for USC against UCLA.  Since the Bruins will likely focus on deterring Lanier as an offensive threat, these two setters have the opportunity to establish their faster-paced offense to give junior outside hitter Alyse Ford and senior opposite hitters Niki Withers and Brittany Abercrombie more hitting opportunities with less pressure from the Bruin block.
However, the key aspect to success against UCLA will be the setters implementing the middle blockers into their offense more than they are currently setting them.  The Trojan middle blockers — Welsh and seniors Jordan Dunn and Danielle Geiger — collectively account for a little over 11 percent of the total attempts despite their combined 79 kills on 154 sets to this date.  
Effectively setting the Trojan middles can only be achieved with a solid serve receive and defensive unit, which junior libero Victoria Garrick has done by leading the back row and accumulating a team-high 150 digs so far this season.
Ultimately, UCLA will be ready to compete and may have a different playing style than what the Trojans have been exposed to, since many of their indoor players also compete for the school’s beach volleyball program, whereas the Trojans’ squad is solely indoor athletes.
Senior setter Sarah Sponcil of UCLA will be leading its offense, and her experience on the sand will give her court vision and awareness that is not typically embodied by solely indoor players.  Sponcil just transferred to UCLA from LMU, where she was a standout beach volleyball athlete before withdrawing to compete for Team USA last year.
The Trojans’ most difficult hurdle to overcome, however, will be the Bruins’ defense.  UCLA junior libero Zana Muno has already earned Pac-12 weekly defensive honors and sophomore libero Savvy Simo has also accumulated numerous digs when playing alongside or replacing Muno.  Both liberos have been key players on the UCLA beach squad in past years, and their defensive capabilities are highly attributable to covering the entire court in the sand game.
Both the Trojans and Bruins are expected to be fired up, and they anticipate a grueling match that will display two ranked and rivaling programs competing to gain an early lead in Pac-12 play.  
 
Time for Coach Haley to pack it up and retire. Not a top player recruited this season to help out Lanier on
the outside or even the middle. He has lost the touch to sell USC as an important program to the girls of
high school volleyball looking for championship aspirations.

Jo Danielle Esteban | Daily Trojan
Following their thrilling double-overtime victory over Texas, the Trojans don’t have much time to relax as they prepare to go up to Northern California and play Cal on Saturday. After opening the season with three straight home wins, the Trojans will be tested with their first road game of the 2017 season. 
Coming in Clutch 
Although its national ranking has slipped from No. 4 to No. 5, USC survived the upset in a nail-biting game.
Head coach Clay Helton praised some underclassmen for their clutch performances that helped the Trojans leave the Coliseum with the win. With a steep learning curve, Helton acknowledged that everyone adjusts to the college game differently. 
“You can always tell when you look at them in the huddle,” Helton said. “You look at their eyes and you can tell, ‘That guy’s ready, that guy’s ready and there’s the big deer in the headlights.’” 
With preparation and constant repetition, Helton received production out of younger players when it mattered the most. After being stopped on the ground for most of the game, freshman running back Stephen Carr made a crucial 21-yard catch in the final seconds of the fourth quarter off a jump throw by redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold. Freshman walk-on kicker Chase McGrath, who missed his first field goal attempt, hit the tying and winning field goals later in the game. 
Helton also praised redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns for his performance on Saturday. After being quiet in the first two games, Vaughns had four catches for 25 yards and played crucial snaps in the fourth quarter and overtime. 
Scouting the Bears 
Cal, which has also started the season 3-0, is coming off a 27-16 win against Ole Miss. The Trojans will see a familiar face on the opposite sideline of California Memorial Stadium. Justin Wilcox, a former USC defensive coordinator, has exceeded expectations after being hired as Cal’s head coach this year. 
“We’re very impressed with their team,” Helton said. “A lot of credit goes to Justin Wilcox and his staff. They’ve got their team playing with a lot of confidence and a lot of effort right now.” 
On offense, the Bears are led by redshirt sophomore quarterback Ross Bowers. Bowers has completed 60 percent of his passes so far this season while throwing for five touchdowns. 
“I think the kid does a really nice job in their run/pass option game, which is a big part of their system, and he also has some accuracy vertically,” Helton said. 
Cal lost their starting running back, senior Tre Watson, early in the season after an unspecified right leg injury. Junior Patrick Laird has stepped up for the Bears in his place, averaging 7.5 yards per carry. 
On the other side of the ball, the Bears are led by a tough front seven. It appears that Wilcox’s hire has helped shore up the Bears’ defense, which has only given up 22 points a game. Their defense is led by senior Devante Downs, who recorded 14 tackles in the Bears’ win over the Rebels. Given Cal’s much-improved defensive unit, the Trojans will be tested in their first road game. After struggling running the ball, the Trojans leaned on the right arm of Darnold to pull out the win. But on Saturday, the Trojans will try to return to their identity of balance on offense by establishing the run game. 
Injuries 
The Trojans came out of the double-overtime battle on Saturday with a win, but got banged up in the process. Junior linebacker Porter Gustin (shoulder), redshirt junior cornerback Ajene Harris (knee), senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu (knee), junior defensive tackle Rasheem Green (ankle), redshirt senior receiver Steven Mitchell (groin) and freshman receiver Joseph Lewis IV all missed practice on Tuesday. Junior running back Ronald Jones II, redshirt sophomore linebacker John Houston Jr. and junior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga were all limited. 
Despite the lengthy injury list, Helton says he’s not too concerned, citing depth all over the field that can fill in until starters get healthy. The Trojans’ injury situation is something to monitor closely, especially because their bye week doesn’t come until the end of the regular season schedule.

Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
As confetti rained down on the Trojans after January’s Rose Bowl Game, no one thought placekicking would be an issue for USC in 2017. After all, Matt Boermeester had just written himself into Trojan lore, splitting the uprights from 46 yards out as time expired to win the Granddaddy of Them All, and he looked to repeat the feat next year — this time in the national championship game. 
Then Boermeester was expelled from the University due to a student conduct issue, and the Trojans suddenly found themselves on the hunt for a national title without a reliable kicker. Head coach Clay Helton gave redshirt freshman Michael Brown the first shot at the job during fall camp, but the scholarship kicker couldn’t beat out a freshman walk-on from Mater Dei High School. Just before USC’s season opener against Western Michigan, Helton announced Chase McGrath had won the gig. 
Two weeks later, McGrath ran onto the field against Texas and knocked through his first two career field goals: one to tie the score as time expired and one to win the game in double-overtime as the Trojans beat the Longhorns 27-24.
“[McGrath] doesn’t play like a freshman,” Helton said following the victory. “What an unbelievable job.” 
It was already an incredibly unlikely sequence of events, but Saturday’s ending was even more remarkable given the start of the day, when McGrath attempted his first career college field goal in the second quarter of a scoreless game. He left it short and wide left. It was a 46-yarder — a tough assignment for a debut attempt — but McGrath brushed off the weight of the moment.
“[The first kick] was a really good learning experience,” he said. “I kind of rushed it a little bit, but once I slowed down and really found my rhythm, it was good.”
The freshman’s unflappability took many by surprise, but it proved to be a valuable asset down the line as McGrath was called on to save the Trojans not long after his disappointing first kick. The Longhorns led by 3 points with two seconds left on the clock, and McGrath was tasked with knocking through a 31-yard attempt. With everything on the line and an earlier miss on his mind, the walk-on still managed to keep a cool head. 
“[Nerves] didn’t kick in that much,” McGrath said. “I treat every kick the same.”
It’s hard to believe, but the results backed up the attitude. Somehow, McGrath was able to step up yet again with a chance to win the game in overtime and nail a 43-yard kick. Texas head coach Tom Herman even called timeout before the attempt to let McGrath’s nervousness build on the sideline. It didn’t matter. 
“I kind of think it’s funny because it gives me more time to lock in,” McGrath said.
Indeed, he came out of the timeout and improved vastly on his first boot of the game — this one had plenty of distance and snuck inside the right upright — and the Trojans mobbed their kicker as confetti shot into the sky and covered the grass. The Los Angeles haze seemed like the  ghosts of the Rose Bowl, swirling around the Coliseum floodlights.
It remains to be seen if McGrath will carry over his impressive performance through the rest of the season. As the year goes on, he may have to kick in windier and much colder conditions, and he has yet to kick outside the friendly confines of his home stadium, and with the high expectations facing USC, the freshman will undoubtedly see more opportunities to be the hero — or the goat.
But after all the uncertainty that surrounded USC’s kicking game leading into this fall, it appears the Trojans have found their man. Following the game, Helton was asked if he had a scholarship available to offer McGrath. The head coach chuckled.
“I need to find one,” he said.
I need to find one??  Give me a break.  Give McGrath a scholarship ASAP.

Two weeks into the NFL regular season, fans of the Los Angeles Chargers and Rams shouldn’t be extremely unhappy with the teams’ 0-2 and 1-1 records, respectively.
On Sunday, the Bolts lost to the Miami Dolphins, 19-17, while the Washington Redskins edged the Rams, 27-20. The Redskins and Dolphins aren’t powerhouse teams, and the Chargers and Rams don’t fit that criterion, either. However, both L.A. teams have shown a level of competitiveness that fans hope will foreshadow a season fighting for a playoff berth — or at least a .500 winning percentage.
That’s the key for the Chargers and Rams’ journey to January 2018. They don’t have to blow the doors off of the division and advance deep into the playoffs. Still, giving fans entertainment and hope for the future is paramount. The Chargers put this idea on display in Week 1, when quarterback Philip Rivers mounted a late comeback against a Denver Broncos team that trounced the Dallas Cowboys in Week 2. The Rams didn’t look like NFL bottom feeders when they posted 46 points on the Indianapolis Colts in the opening week.
The tables turned for the Rams in Week 2. Signal caller Jared Goff didn’t throw for more than 300 yards with no interceptions like he did to start the season. With 1:37 left to play and a touchdown needed to tie the game against the Redskins, Goff, who finished the game with 221 yards, stared down wide receiver Cooper Kupp and threw a predictable interception to end his squad’s comeback aspirations. 
The great news about this game is that even though the Redskins were up 13-0 in the second quarter, you didn’t see the scoreline get considerably worse for the Rams. In fact, by halftime, the score was 20-10 for the Rams, and in the third quarter, Goff watched his defense hold the ’Skins scoreless. Meanwhile, Goff hit running back Todd Gurley for an 18-yard touchdown. Gurley seemed to return to form as he was a force in the running game (88 yards, averaging 5.5 yards per carry) and a necessary cog in the receiving game with 48 yards on three receptions. 
With Gurley healthy, the Rams will have their fair share of chances to win. But the worrisome part about the phrase “Gurley healthy” is that, without him on the field, the Rams’ road to victory gets that much harder. And since he’s getting the ball a lot, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him injured at some point.
The Rams’ defense isn’t terrible, but right now it doesn’t look like it’s at the level where it can define a game. A defense like the Broncos’ fills that purpose, but there are few units in the NFL boasting that level of superiority. Thus, the onus falls on Goff to be the integral player in the Rams’ success at many occasions in the season. Gurley shredding another team will matter significantly less if Goff throws interceptions at crucial points in regular season competitions.
On the other hand, the Chargers should feel comfortable with the veteran Rivers at quarterback. The aging Rivers has almost always been a gunslinger in the NFL, meaning he can make big plays some of the time and make costly mistakes at other junctures. Against some opponents, he’s able to throw himself back into games. We haven’t seen much from Goff as far as NFL comebacks are concerned, but the Rams’ front office must have felt he would end up becoming their franchise quarterback after they took him at No. 1 in the 2016 NFL Draft.
There’s no doubt the Chargers know Rivers’ window to compete for a championship is closing, and most signs are pointing to him never getting the opportunity to play in the Super Bowl. Rivers was mulling over retirement in 2015 following a 2014 season that saw him sustain rib and back injuries. But he signed a four-year deal in August 2015, meaning that he might stay a Charger until his contract runs out at the end of the 2019 season.
Facing the Dolphins this weekend, Chargers tight end Antonio Gates broke the record for the most touchdowns by a tight end in NFL history — a huge feat — but the losing final score marked the Chargers’ inability to win in close games. Rivers did his part to drive the team for the winning field goal with five seconds remaining, but rookie kicker Younghoe Koo missed the kick that would have won the game.
Misfortune strikes all teams in the NFL, and sometimes it plainly results in defeat. The Chargers have been that unfortunate squad, and the Rams are seeing if Goff is up to overcome that challenge. Regardless of the noted woes of these two Los Angeles outfits, and even though it may seem easy to bet against both of them, they battle for all four quarters and have exciting talent like Gurley, Aaron Donald, Keenan Allen, Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram. So you can sleep on their playoff chances. But watching their entertaining games shouldn’t put you to sleep.

They might be your friends, classmates or tour guides. You may see them in the library or skateboarding across campus. You might also recognize them from your computer screen or your Facebook feed — that’s because in the lives of USC’s YouTubers and social media content creators, being a student and a global internet personality are one and the same.
YouTubers on college campuses have become a phenomena, with an extensive market of viewers interested in getting a glimpse into the college lifestyle. They are products of a generation of young people who grew up with technology and have the skills and platforms to capture and share their lives. 
Students at USC, however, seem to be particularly plugged into this trend.
“It’s almost like if YouTube had a university,” said Rowan Born, a freshman majoring in journalism. 
Her YouTube channel currently has over 4,800 subscribers and continues to grow, and her most popular video has nearly 20,000 views. 
Well-known YouTubers hailing from USC include recent graduate Katherine Berry, sophomore Joi Wade, senior Annemarie Allen, junior Tasha Farsaci, junior Justin Escalona and sophomore Markian Benhamou. These Trojans have a composite subscriber and follower count of over 980,000.
“When you look online, there’s no other school that has this many YouTubers concentrated in one area,” Born said. “I think location is a big [reason for this], and then the fact that this is a private university, so even though this is a big school, it has a more family-like feeling. And then just with the dynamic that there is on campus, [in regard to] student life. So the combination of those factors really makes the school worth recording and putting on the internet. And then you have the prestige in there, so it’s just kind of got everything.”
Many of USC’s YouTubers, such as Born, Berry, Wade, Chase and Farsaci, primarily make “vlogs” and advice videos, in which they speak directly into the camera, address their audience and focus the clip on a particular college-related theme. 
“Over the course of my college application journey, I made various videos about the schools I applied to, and then when I decided where I was going, I started doing full-out high school help videos, college advice videos and now I’m doing videos about what it’s like at USC,” Born said.
For Born, the focus of her channel has directly impacted who her audience is, and from personal experience, she knows there is a niche for her on YouTube.
“[My] main audience … [is] often [high school] juniors and seniors,” Born said. “I remember being in the college application process and just being absolutely desperate for any content that I could get that had anything to do with USC, because it was a dream school of mine since I was 12. And then it gets so many views because, like I said, it’s those kids who are really desperate to go to USC … and they’re just trying to feed off of that.” 
Her own desire to create and connect has shaped the content that Born now uploads to her channel.
“Personally, I think just watching a lot of those videos, outside of just the academics, kind of helped me shape my idea of what USC was and put that into my application,” Born said. 
There are a number of content creators at USC with different approaches to their channels. Benhamou, who may be best known on and off campus for his popular “Fake Celebrity Sneaking into Frat Party” and “Dressing Up as a Girl to Frat Party” videos, now focuses on Facebook videos aimed at “making people smile.”
“My whole branding is about smiling, having a positive theme,” Benhamou said. “My content is very family-friendly and relatable, and I hit a million likes this summer, about a month ago. It’s been growing very fast and I’ve enjoyed the transition from YouTube to Facebook.”
Escalona, also known as PlayTheGameFilms, has forgone the traditional vlog and direct-address structure in his channel as well, at least partially.
“When I moved out to college … my first month I didn’t do anything film-related,” Escalona said. “And then one day it really hit me hard … So my roommate and I made a commitment — we were like, ‘Let’s make a video every single day, but let’s not make some [regular] vlog, let’s make a daily documentary.’”
That idea spawned his series Daily Docs, which features videos he uploaded for 400 consecutive days. Escalona credits this dedicated routine as the primary factor for his spike in views and subscriptions. 
“I was really focused on growing my YouTube channel, because I thought if I can get my YouTube channel to be really big, it could get me a lot of leverage in the film world one day,” Escalona said.
While Escalona has focused on using his experience as one aspect in a future career, some creators see social media growth as their primary goal.
“[Social media] is crazy and it’s incredible,” Benhamou said. “It’s such a new, evolving industry that you almost can’t study it because it’s changing so quickly. A lot of people don’t understand it, especially older people — that’s why you don’t learn about it in your marketing classes, in your communication classes.”
Benhamou argues that despite being relatively new to the scene, social media has rapidly ascended to become an important aspect in launching and maintaining  successful business ventures.
“It’s a new business model that is incredibly vital, and those that understand it and know how to use it effectively will benefit immensely in whatever they’re doing,” Benhamou added.
With this in mind, Benhamou founded Reach, the first social media-related community at USC.
“It’s going to be an incredible club where we’re going to have huge influencer guest speakers, workshops to teach people how to create viral content, how to do growth hacking — but most of all, we want to create a family-like community,” Benhamou said. “So it’s not a class or lecture-style organization.”
However, social media has also met its  critics, who point to its potentially negative usage and extremely widespread reach as  safety and security risks. But for these students, the tool is a positive and creative platform that allows them to craft unique personalities.
“I love social media as a creative outlet,” Born said. “I think that’s the best way to look at it. I know a lot of people try to demonize social media for various reasons, and it’s not perfect, but I definitely think that if you try to make the most of it in a positive situation, it can really bring about a lot of change.”
Wow, beautifully-written and insightful as always, Ms. Rollins-Fife!

Just the other week, I was applying my standard daily eyeliner when I noticed some fine lines emanating from the corners of my eyes when I smiled. 
Assuming I’ll make it to 75, this discovery immediately sent me spiraling into a full-blown quarter-life crisis. Before I knew it, I was wading through 20 tabs on my computer touting the benefits of rosehip oil in minimizing the appearance of crow’s feet. For God’s sake, I’m 18, not 38. I thought I was excused from worrying about collagen and skin elasticity until my mid-20s, at least. 
This obsessive compulsion over a particular physical trait, has, I’ve noticed, become a recurring pattern of behavior over the years. Out of the blue, I’ll discern some deficiency with my [insert specific attribute here], scour decades-old forums and sketchy exercise websites in the hopes of finding a miraculous overnight remedy, cry about it in front of the bathroom mirror, and then, in a month, return to the same oblivious indifference that I possessed before all the fuss began. That is, until the cycle commences all over again. 
I’m sure that 15 years of classical ballet haven’t helped; if anything, it’s only exacerbated the neurosis. Staring at yourself in the mirror for 10 hours a week, scrutinizing every lump and bump and drawing unflattering comparisons to the gazelle-like girls around you, isn’t exactly conducive to a healthy self-image. 
Of course, body insecurity is nothing new to my particular demographic. You’d be hard-pressed to find a single teenage girl who hasn’t shouldered the burden hoisted on her by movies and magazines to be pretty, be thin, be flawless. 
But my itchy discomfort in my own skin goes beyond pure self-esteem issues. I recently came to the realization that all of my contributions will always be accompanied by a caveat. There is no way to separate the pure, crystal clarity of thought and theory, to screen out all the messy bodily functions that come attached to ownership of a consciousness. 
Existence precedes essence; the mind and the body are mutually inclusive. My cognitive system and my somatic system can never be sundered. Consequently, whatever contributions I have to offer, my philosophical musings, my conceptual reasoning, are first passed through the filter of my perceived attractiveness. My rounded nose, my monolid eyes — they are a blight upon the sterile sanctity of abstraction. 
Believe me, if I were capable of transcending my tangibility, sloughing off my body like the skin of a snake and existing solely as a sentient entity manifesting in a glimmer of sunlight, the whisper of a current, I would do it in a heartbeat. I mean, in a second, because I wouldn’t have a heartbeat anymore. 
But I can’t, so I’ll settle for the next best thing. Nowadays, I largely disregard my body — an annoying but necessary fact of existence — like taxes or traffic on the 10. I live in a blissful state of willful ignorance, punctured, on occasion, by a sharp pinprick of the old insecurity. But these instances are few and far between, and for the most part I go on living sans souci, the architecture of my flesh and sinews a mere afterthought. 
In the meantime, my crisis over my crow’s feet has diminished, but not disappeared completely. But what am I supposed to do — stop smiling? I think I’d rather invest in a bulk order of rosehip oil.

Whether they know it or not, pop music listeners have been affected by Rostam’s explosive creativity and musical talent. Although he’s most famously known as an ex-member of indie rock band Vampire Weekend, he’s also responsible for delivering some of the most transformative sounds in contemporary music. 
With every artist vying to cut through pop’s lethargy and bring something fresh to the table, the ones who are successful at achieving this tall task employ Rostam as their secret weapon.  His experimentation with pop landscapes occurs ingeniously, as reflected in some of the most monumental projects of 2015 and 2016 including Frank Ocean’s Blonde, Carly Rae Jepsen’s Emotion and Solange’s A Seat at the Table. 
No matter what project he’s working on, Rostam always leaves his signature dash of flavor and warmth that earns these albums an avant-garde status. Now, his eagerly-anticipated transition from a behind-the-scenes mastermind to a front-running solo artist has begun at once with a sonic triumph and a gentle unfolding of his personal identity. 
His self-titled album was six years in the making, a product of great care and precision and a catharsis of pent-up creative energy. 
Most fans hoped for an album with a sound reminiscent of Vampire Weekend as they anxiously waited for Rostam, and at times, that’s what they’ll get. That’s because Rostam brought lead singer Ezra Koenig’s quips, witticisms and infectious melodies to life. With “Sumer” evoking holiday warmth with a Christmas choir, the use of Bollywood strings on “Wood,” and the synth-pop feel on “Bike Dream,” this album experiments with diverse sonic landscapes and provokes a range of emotions. 
At times layered and fussy, such as in the futuristic sounding, auto-tune heavy “Warning Intruders,” and at times delicate and sweet, such as in the title track ballad “Half-light,” this album does not pin down a certain ambience. But that’s what’s so brilliant about Rostam. Since he went into this project with years of master experience he’s accrued by working closely with chart-topping musicians across multiple genres, he had the creative flexibility to experiment and still deliver the crispness and precision we seek as attentive music listeners. 
That being said, the album may feel too long at times, with certain interlude tracks drifting by unnoticed. With a total of 15 songs, it is a stretch on time when considering the virtues of conciseness. But the aspect of this album most appreciated is the emotional resonance of the lyrics, as listeners are blessed with moments of poetry and flickers of revelation drawn from Rostam’s personal experiences. 
Rostam also has the voice to sing you sweetly to sleep, delivering these lines with a hushed, and at times quivering voice that is bound to leave you clutching your heart. His soft vocals are complemented by heartfelt lyrics. One of the final tracks, “Gwan,” is an uplifting piece with profound advice. He sings of a figure who provides warmth and comfort, “And then I see you/the light falls through the room/and all of it don’t seem so hard” before pondering humans’ tendencies to long for someone who may never walk into their life “Do you ever get the sense?/you’re watching someone else/your face against the glass.”  
Although “When” subtly touches subtly on political topics such as wealth distribution and the military, this album at its core is about coming of age, dreams, self-discovery, a queer and fraternal love and anticipating what’s to come.

Provocative far-right speakers Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and Steve Bannon are slated to speak at “Free Speech Week” next week at UC Berkeley. The organizing group, Berkeley Patriot, has had some logistical difficulties, but if it pulls off even a scaled-back version of this event, it’ll be controversial. There are significant divides within the campus community over the traditional free speech versus human decency issue, but for the sake of understanding, I offer these observations about my fellow conservative students who, by my measure, seem to have mixed and often negative feelings about conservative college stuntsman-ship like that about to commence at UC Berkeley. The fact of the matter is, emphasis on this kind of media-seeking activism eclipses the more temperate conservatism that many center-right students tend to exude.
Today’s young conservatives are, by my observation, more likely to call themselves “fiscally conservative and socially liberal,” and be as accepting and tolerant of people of all ethnicities and sexual orientations as many in the center or on the left. 
It seems to me that many conservative students are uncomfortable with liberal campus political habits, including the general worldview of “intersectionality” in social justice that informs many formal campus conversations, the highly confrontational nature of certain sectors of campus politics and the protests, marches and vigils that divide highly complex and passion-laden issues into stark questions of right and wrong, justice and oppression. (Yes, Yiannpoulos does these things too; no, you won’t find all conservative students supporting that.)
Many campus conservatives might actually be somewhat sympathetic to many of the causes that Black Lives Matter affiliates or feminist organizations advocate for. But the tactics of those organizations, their postmodern rhetoric against things conservative students hold dear, and their tendency to view less passionate supporters as guilty of insufficient zeal, tarnish these groups in the eyes of right-leaning students.
These conservative students feel — and are — outnumbered. It’s no secret that many political science classes at USC are dominated by liberal-leaning students, with only a handful of conservatives. That disparity doesn’t make conservatives a persecuted minority by any means — but then again, you don’t have to be a persecuted minority to feel ostracized by popular opinion.
All of these trends converge to make conservative students on campus — with some justification — feel separated and annoyed with the broader campus culture and proud of their political identity. And that separation, annoyance and pride, metastasized and overdone, are what fundamentally drive quiet sympathy for Yiannopoulos-like speakers, rather than total agreement with those speakers’ worldviews. Few people actually like Yiannopoulos, but plenty of decent and otherwise politically uninvolved people have a guilty pleasure knowing that someone so preposterously obnoxious can be such a gadfly in the left’s soup.
I can hear the critiques about white,
middle-class privilege coming. And they may well be right. It may well be true that “privilege” of whatever sort is the reason conservative students can feel this way, that unjust power structures and oppressive normative constructions have disposed some of us to benefit from others’ exclusion. I’m not doubting this.
But conceding all that, it’s difficult to convince someone that they, their beliefs and their habits are the problem. It would seem that jeremiads about racial justice and gender construction do more to drive right-leaning students toward Yiannopoulos, and not away from him. I’m not saying the left is wrong in its beliefs, but I do think its expression and evangelization of those beliefs can be counterproductive if its aim is conversion.
It’s important to understand where people come from, especially when they or their affiliates keep finding their way into the national news. I think my side has a long way to go to deserve wider respect across the political spectrum; in the same vein, the campus left could put in more effort to understand where my cousins-in-party-registration are coming from. And as the divisive events at UC Berkeley’s “Free Speech Week” unfold in a few days, maybe that understanding can preclude some vitriol.

Like many other Trojans, I’ll be making the drive up the California coast this weekend for the Weekender, the annual football game that USC plays at either Stanford University or UC Berkeley. It’s at Berkeley this year, so when I leave the campus on Sunday, it’ll also be the first day of its Free Speech Week, an event hosted by conservative student group the Berkeley Patriot featuring  right-wing provocateurs by the likes of “Darkness is good” Steve Bannon and “Feminism is cancer” Milo Yiannopoulos. A proverbial middle finger to UC Berkeley’s controversial shutdown of Yiannopoulos’ speech in February, Free Speech Week will be the ultimate campus test, which will likely see mass protests and thousands of dollars in police presence over the next week. It will be a spectacle that is not what our educational institutions or our country need right now.
An event of these massive proportions is a testament to the commitment to free speech — and to revamping UC Berkeley’s image — held by Chancellor Carol Christ, who has called this year a “free speech year.” And her promise to create fora of open debate is laudable. Intellectual diversity prevents the kind of echo chamber that can stifle productive dialogue. For young people who are still shaping their ideas about the world and understanding their role in it, it is especially important to analyze different viewpoints and engage in thoughtful conversation.
Berkeley Patriot’s decision to host Free Speech Week next week isn’t about that. If it was, they would have invited someone like Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, not incendiary media personalities like Ann Coulter. But instead of fostering a real conversation, Berkeley Patriot has amassed a list of conservative firebrands more interested in theatrics than dialogue in an attempt to make headlines. And, following the national headlines made in February by protests outside Yiannopoulos’ speech at Berkeley, they’ll probably succeed, providing conservatives nationwide with the wry satisfaction that the liberal snowflakes can’t handle free speech — perhaps ignoring the right to protest that is written just as intentionally into the First Amendment as the right to free speech is. 
It’s a shame that Berkeley Patriot chose to entertain the pageantry of these agitators, because it has wasted an opportunity to forge real intellectual bridges across the aisle. Their embrace of those who incite hatred just to prove a point is disgraceful. Amid a national backdrop in which the president tweeted a GIF of himself committing violence against his failed political opponent, the group’s encouragement of nastiness echoes a larger, and dangerous, trend toward the decline of civility among left-right discourse that needs to stop. 
The Berkeley College Republicans wrote on Facebook in February: “The Free Speech Movement is dead.” If they really thought so, then they deserve congratulations — the existence of Free Speech Week is proof that UC Berkeley can and will host any speaker, regardless of viewpoint. But is hearing from Steve Bannon and Ann Coulter without protest really what the Free Speech Movement was about? Guest student writer Camila Elizabet Aguirre Aguilar wrote in an op-ed in The Daily Californian last week: “The greatest perversion of the Free Speech Movement lies in the fact that though it initially sought to legitimize the oppressed, it is now being appropriated to legitimize oppression.” 
In the counterpart to this column, columnist Luke Phillips makes an interesting point about Free Speech Week: On college campuses, it’s the public shaming from the left that drives those who fail to fit the typical liberal mold to contrarians like Yiannopoulos. Maybe he is right. Trumpism and alt-right fever has not ended at USC’s gates, and in its wake, we need to dispatch more concerted efforts to engage in constructive dialogue and welcome dissent — not to entertain those that inspire hatred, but to allow for agreement to disagree.
It is a difficult balance to strike. To give space to some viewpoints — for example, neo-Nazism and white supremacy — and allow them to go unchallenged on a college campus would be shameful and unproductive. But we need to take a more honest, critical look at the kind of atmosphere we’re fostering, and ask ourselves if we allow space to engage each other in a meaningful way. 
That is the point of this “Point/Counterpoint” column. If Luke and I can do it, anyone on this campus can.
These are fraught political times. UC Berkeley’s student groups should do what is right; just because they can invite Ann Coulter and Steve Bannon doesn’t mean that they should. Free Speech Week will only pour gasoline on the ideological flames at UC Berkeley, USC and nationwide. Until we commit ourselves to respectful and dignified debate and search for some form of common ground, they will just keep burning.

If Bannon, Coulter and the rest of the deplorables truly have patently stupid ideas, then what the opposition should want is to have them heard through their own words to quickly bring their own downfall. This notion we need to listen only to people in the center is as bad as saying we only should listen to people on the left. Ideas are meant to be social, communicable spores that occupy the ether and people have the option to inhale it or not. I do not need a DT journalist to tell me who I should listen to and who I would be wasting time listen to. Please, don’t do me any favors.
If Cal doesn’t invite controversial speakers, always from the Right, then they are cowards essentially banning ideological opponents.  That would be soft fascism.
Free speech at Cal was dead until Cal funded the police protection of a free speech event to the tune of about $600k. Why so much?  Because the anti free speech movement of Antifa, BLM and BAMN published statements stating they would riot in the streets and bring destruction on the city and campus.  Is that free speech? Do you want Antifa to destroy our campus? Not hardly, but you cannot limit free speech just because you disagree with it, otherwise you are promoting a restrictive environment and promoting the exact fascist movement you support. Our country doesn’t operate that way.
I dislike Coulter and Brannon. At best, they are obnoxious. At best.  What they spout revolts me. 
But they are not Nazis, Klan, etc., calling for mass murder, racial revolution, civil war, criminal acts, or the violent overthrow of our government. THAT kind of speaker I would ban. We are not Constitutionally obliged to give such vile creatures a forum. 
But mere conservatives? Disagreeable? Maybe, but not at level that they should be banned.They should be allowed to speak on campus.
You seem to think any group you don’t like doesn’t have free speech rights. Yours is an anti-free speech worldview masquerading as moderacy.

The Center for the Digital Future at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism released its 15th annual report detailing technology’s footprint in the United States this month.
The study explores how digital technology is changing American lives, and has two objectives: to explore actions and opinions related to the use or non-use of online technology, and to chronicle the emergence of changes as they occur.
92 percent of respondents in the 2016 report’s claimed to be internet user, compared to 67 percent of respondents in 2000. Similarly, weekly internet use has increased. In the the newest report, respondents claimed to spend an average of nearly 24 hours per week on the internet. In 2000, respondents spent less than 10 hours per week on the internet. 
Internet use at home has grown nearly sixfold since the initial study was conducted, jumping from 3.3 hours per week to 17.6 hours per week. 
Students in particular have utilized the internet more in recent years. In 2009, only 32 percent of students claimed to do schoolwork on the internet. By 2016, that number more than doubled to 65 percent. 
Much of this has been gradual and organic, but in some cases, such as many Annenberg classes, laptops are required in class.
Respondents who claimed to be technology users seemed to see these trends toward digital connectivity as either benign or positive influences on society. 
In each study, the majority of respondents answered that they believe that communication technology makes the world a better place. 
However, non-user respondents have leaned further in the opposite direction as the years have passed. 43 percent of respondents claimed that it has a negative impact and only 35 percent said that it has a positive impact, according to the 2016 report.
In contrast,  in 2000, 49 percent of non-users believed that communication technology makes the world a better place, with only 17 percent believing that it makes the world a worse place.

USC alumnus Will Ferrell and his wife, Viveca Paulin, endowed the University’s first full women’s soccer scholarship through a gift to USC Athletics, the University announced on Tuesday. 
The Viveca Paulin and Will Ferrell Scholarship Fund aims to help USC recruit female students who are exceptional soccer players. Scholarships make up a large component of USC Athletics’ annual budget, which totals over $19 million. 
“We are fortunate to have Will and Viveca in our Trojan Family,” USC President C.L. Max Nikias told USC News. “From the beginning, they have understood the importance of scholarships and wanted to commit their resources to touch students’ lives and strengthen USC through the quality of our student body.” 
The Viveca Paulin and Will Ferrell Scholarship isn’t the only option for recruiting student athletes. In 2012, USC Athletics created the Heritage Initiative, a fundraising drive with the goal of raising $1 million for each of the 283 scholarships provided for USC’s 21 varsity sports. 
USC women’s soccer has consistently been ranked among the nation’s best, and the team won the NCAA Division I National Championship in 2016. 
Ferrell graduated from USC in 1980 with a bachelor’s degree in sports information. Since then, he and his wife have continued to donate to the University, including causes like Cancer for College and Swim with Mike. In May, Ferrell was the main speaker at USC’s 134th commencement ceremony.

Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
From growing up in the Bronx in an immigrant family composed of Jews, Muslims and Orthodox Christians to studying at a 500-year-old Sufi school in Afghanistan in his 20s, spiritual leader J. Jaye Gold has acquired myriad life experiences. His colorful life has led him to write books on a wide range of topics, from life and travel to financial espionage and poker. Gold brought his life experiences to USC on Monday night, leading a discussion with Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni on the connection between world peace and inner peace.
“I think it’s easier to understand things if you read it in a story,” Gold said. “I’ve learned a lot from movies and words and songs and poetry … because in those kinds of venues you can extract what means something to you, and somebody’s not telling you what to think.”
For this reason, Gold does not consider his books instructional.
“I don’t tell people what to do in books,” Gold said. “I use the books more for trying to get people enthusiastic. There’s other ways of looking at life.”
The majority of Gold’s works became books unintentionally. Only The Roca Group: A Tale of Financial Espionage was intentionally written into a book. The others were a compilation of short writings he had written over time, Gold said.
As he wrote about in his newest autobiography Justin Time, which came out in November 2016, his way of thinking changed greatly as he transitioned from a child growing up in the Bronx to a spiritual teacher.
“I was a little bit dense and a little bit not so exploratory and not so willing to look at things in a different way, so it took that travel and took meeting new people,” Gold said.
He credits his change in thought to a man he met in South America during his 20s.
“He would call my attention to things that I was basically oblivious of, usually small things,” Gold said. “He would call embarrassment ‘little death,’ and you don’t have to go through the big death because if you feel embarrassed and people around you feel a little bit of that death, it’s heavy and we do everything we can to avoid that embarrassment.”
Once Gold changed his perspectives, he began moving negative obstacles from his life, focusing instead on meditation and other forms of reflection.
Gold believes that humanity is a gift, and should remain a central thought in people’s minds.
“Like you’re a great athlete, that’s ok, but if you weren’t a human being you couldn’t be a great athlete,” he said. “I have come to value having a human life far above all those other things so I don’t really feel the separation that plagues the world right now in so many ways.”
During his talk at USC, Gold claimed that inner peace is the solution to social harmony and urged others to leave things like fear and jealousy behind.
He also stressed the importance of exploration and taking chances before beginning introspection.
“The going-out process of learning to control your environment, to not feel victim to that environment, to not feel like less than that environment and the process of coming home is much more a process of relinquishing control,” Gold said.
In light of current events, Gold believes it is important for others to realize that they are united by humanity.
“People are neglected and immigrants are neglected and gay people are neglected and women are neglected,” Gold said. “There are so many people that are neglected, but if people really recognize that we’re all in this together as human beings not in a philosophical way but an actual way, it could have a little bit of an impact.”

The USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center is taking steps to improve the detection of breast cancer in women through a new clinical trial.
Mary Yamashita is the chief researcher for the clinical trial, which uses ultrasound technology to screen women for breast cancer. Her office is the only site in Southern California for the nationwide clinical trial that uses SoftVue, a 3-D ultrasound system. It is also the first of eight health centers across the United States to test it. 
SoftVue takes a comprehensive 3-D image that allows doctors to view four different cross sections for women with dense breast tissue. The trial has a goal of testing 10,000 women, and the results will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration to approve SoftVue as a supplemental screening indication for breast cancer, according to Yamashita. 
Beginning at age 40, women will typically undergo annual mammograms that help detect cancerous lumps. However, mammograms can only read so much, and doctors performing the procedure on women with dense breast tissue have a harder time identifying cancers. 
There are no telling markers as to why some women have denser breast tissues than others, Yamashita said. Over 40 percent of adult women have dense breast tissue, with the phenomena occurring more often in younger women. 
 “When we say dense breast tissue, we’re not talking about how dense the breast feels, but it’s about how it appears on a mammogram,” Yamashita said. “So, if you have dense breast tissue, then that means on a mammogram, your breast looks white. If you have more fatty tissue, then on the mammogram, the breast looks dark. Breast cancer appears white.”
Yamashita identifies this as the crux of the problem facing current technology. 
Doctors with patients that have dense breast tissues have a harder time identifying cancer because of the current imaging results. Thus, it is even more difficult to detect breast cancers among these patients. 
The clinical trial has been a long time coming for Yamashita, who began working with breast cancer and ultrasound devices nearly 10 years ago when USC was involved in a multi-center ultrasound study. 
“When we did that study, we discovered that with ultrasound, when we added it to mammography, we were able to find additional cancers that were not seen on [the] mammogram,” Yamashita said. 
The details of Yamashita’s previous study at USC was the preface to the current ultrasound technology trial she is developing at the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
The new ultrasound technology allows for four different cross sections to be viewed. SoftVue provides the standard black and white reflection image, as well as a color transmission image, a sound speed image and stiffness fusion image. 
All four images combined create a stronger indicator of whether someone has breast cancer when they also have dense breast tissue. According to Yamashita, cancerous masses have a very specific makeup and are more easily identified once all four images are combined in order to identify masses.
“Different companies have tried to come up with an automated ultrasound system so that you’re not relying on the person scanning,” Yamashita said. “It is more efficient, more accurate but there really is no tool out there right now that is completely automated.” 
SoftVue, she said, is different, as it is completely automated and does not need a secondary person there to hold the breast while the transducer creates the image. In addition, it takes only about two to four minutes to take images, as opposed to 20 to 30 minutes for a handheld ultrasound. 
Yamashita’s clinical trial, if proven successful, will allow women with dense breast tissue to have a more accurate reading that will hopefully allow for earlier and better detection of cancerous lumps.
