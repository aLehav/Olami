As USC descends into the Red Zone — the months between the start of the academic year and November, during which more than 50% of sexual assaults statistically take place at universities — students look to a technology-based organization as a protected alternative for reporting incidents of sexual assault.
Callisto is a nonprofit organization that helps university students report instances of sexual assault and match with other survivors. It aims to defend sexual assault survivors’ autonomy by allowing students to file reports without their name or obligation attached.
While not formally partnered with USC, the third-party resource welcomes students to use its online platform and connect with a network of survivors from around 40 other universities.
The organization introduced a record vault and anonymous reporting software this year to help survivors document incidents, identify perpetrators and take action in confidence.
Amelie Schlager, a senior majoring in international relations with an emphasis in global business, is the USC Head Campus Ambassador for Callisto. She said the organization’s resources help catch offenders through a secure and confidential reporting system.
“If students want to enter into Callisto’s matching system, that can help identify repeat perpetrators across our network,” Schlager said. “If they don’t want to enter into matching, they can choose to use Callisto’s encrypted record form, which creates a secure, confidential and time-stamped record so that they can document what happened to them and then file a formal report later on.”
If the system confirms a match, all survivors involved are granted free legal options counseling. From there, they can decide whether to report the incident to the school or contact law enforcement.
Schlager said survivors have complete control over the reporting process and choosing which steps to take. She said protecting survivors’ autonomy is an integral part of the healing process.
“A big part of what happens during sexual assault experiences is that survivors feel like they have lost all of their power and lost complete control of the situation,” Schlager said. “It’s really important that we give them their power back and fully allow them to heal.”
Lindsey Walton, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she believes Callisto is a more comfortable alternative to reporting directly to the authorities or using EEO-TIX, the University’s reporting system for gender-based discrimination and harassment. 
“While [Title IX] provides students an opportunity to seek justice, it doesn’t necessarily do so in the most beneficial way,” Walton said. “Students may not feel comfortable reporting, and their cases may be swept under the rug even if they do report, which is problematic.”
When students report through EEO-TIX, a response team compiles evidence in a non-confidential report. While the team considers the victim’s wants, it also considers community safety, and the reporting office ultimately holds the discretion to disclose private information. EEO-TIX also provides a list of additional confidential resources in its “Resolution Process for Sexual Misconduct” document. 
Schlager said that in contrast to EEO-TIX, Callisto is entirely confidential and anonymous. It allows students to assume control over what information they report and how and when they take action.
“[Callisto] offers an alternative to the flawed Title IX reporting system and also an alternative to reporting to law enforcement,” Schlager said. “I know from peers that [it]’s a very traumatizing experience, so Callisto is a really incredible resource for USC students because it empowers survivors and allows them to seek justice on their own terms and to find their own pathways towards healing.”
Survivor support groups at USC, such as Survivor Support Community and the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, have partnered with Callisto to spread awareness about the project and provide student resources.
SSC president Sammie Sorsby-Jones said the reporting process is often difficult for survivors. She supports Callisto’s efforts to grant victims autonomy and bring survivors together to make the process more comfortable.
In addition to providing direct service, SSC welcomes victims and allies to foster a supportive legacy of survivors.
“I think the administration can often be so bureaucratic that it’s not as helpful as what survivors need, and I think that having a community of peers who understand what you’re going through  and can be there for you is so important,” said Sorsby-Jones, a junior majoring in law, history and culture. 
In a study conducted by the Association of American Universities in 2019, 31% of female undergraduates at USC said they were sexually assaulted at some point in college. Eighty-four percent of all undergraduates who experienced sexual harassment did not contact USC resources, according to the report.
Third-party reporting systems, such as Callisto, aim to mitigate fear in reporting instances of sexual assault, helping students be proactive in seeking healing and justice.
“Seeking justice is one thing … but healing is a whole different story,” Schlager said. “[Healing] requires [survivors] to feel like they can define their own pathways and can make a difference in their own life.”

Just in time for spooky season, a new exhibit at Doheny Memorial Library displays the gory history of the witchcraft trials. 
Fear of witchcraft led to the persecution and execution of around 50,000 people by the late 16th cCentury. Books that sought to undermine the position of women in society veiled their intentions through criticisms of witchcraft, which came to be associated with untamed female deviance and mental illness.
These real life artifacts from the era of witch hunts can be found at the exhibit, titled “The Misogyny of Witchcraft,” located at the 2nd floor of Doheny in the Special Collections area.
The exhibit showcases a timeline of the paranoia toward witchcraft spanning from the medieval era to the 17th century.
The digital version of the exhibit on the USC Libraries website also ventures into the 18th century and includes more photos of the different artifacts and a bibliography for further reading. 
Sue Luftschein, the head of Special Collections at Doheny Library, has worked on the exhibit for about three months. The more books Luftschein researched, the more she realized the era of persecuting women of witchcraft was where she wanted to focus the exhibit.
“The treatment of women in the early modern period was incredibly misogynistic, so that really sort of framed the whole thing,” Luftschein said.
The exhibit displays books that have been around for centuries, yet still remain in well-kept condition.
“It’s amazing to work with [these old artifacts]. You know, this is the kind of stuff that I didn’t realize was still around when I was a kid growing up,” said Special Collections Library supervisor Gabriel Contreras.
Each piece of text delves into the author’s evaluation and beliefs pertaining to the fear of witches. “The Malleus Maleficarum,” written by Heinrich Kramer, served as a manual for investigating and prosecuting witches. Exhibit attendees will be able to see a copy of the book printed in 1519.
The exhibit explores the misogynistic views of medieval to late 17th century writers, including Lavater and Trithemius, who theorized that women, who they believed to be the weaker sex and permitting of sin, were the predominant practitioners of withcraft. 
“[The exhibit] speaks to a pretty terrifying episode in women’s history, as well as Western European history and religious history,” Luftschein said. “We can always certainly learn from the lessons of the past, hopefully.”
Contreras said he feels it’s important for men to visit this exhibit to learn about the misogyny that plagued the past and also reflects the society that we live in today.
“It’s important, especially as a man, we need to learn about misogyny. We grew up in a very sexist society. Undoing machismo is something that’s important,” Contreras said. 
Luftschein conceptualized the exhibit while brainstorming ideas for this year’s Halloween-themed display.
The original idea for the exhibit was to display books about tarot and fortune teller cards, until Luftschein noticed that USC had a lot of ancient books on witchcraft.
“I started looking at other related materials and saw that we have a lot of books actually on witchcraft and as I started to do more and more research, I realized that this is really where I wanted to focus the exhibit,” Luftschein said.
Luftschein researched the impact of the authors and found books with depictive illustrations to present to exhibit attendees. 
The library acquired the artifacts on display from a variety of different sources: some were originally purchased by the first director of the School of Philosophy back in the 1920s and ’30s, while others were acquired from donations and other purchases over the years that Luftschein scoured through to bring the exhibit to life.
“I went down a lot of rabbit holes doing the research for this exhibit,” Luftschein said.
Martin Yoon, a freshman majoring in international relations, visited the exhibit this past week and said he had a “surreal” experience.
“Those books have been used as propaganda in a sense and this has existed not that long ago — only a few 100 years ago,” Yoon said.
Yoon’s first introduction to the witch hunts was through reading Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” in high school, but now, he said, seeing physical anti-witchcraft books made that point in history more real for him. 
The anxiety surrounding the presumed witches of the 13th to 17th centuries, Yoon said, can be seen as a parallel for the worries some people have today about encountering new ways of thinking — a mindset that, he said, leads to bigotry and exclusion.
“There’s moments of panic and fear that we have, especially when we don’t know someone really well,” Yoon said. “[That kind of panic and fear] is applicable to many of the issues that we have today.”

For many, their childhood memories may not be fully crystalline, but the emotions attached to these memories are ever present.
It is astonishing that, far beyond his adolescence, director James Gray still remembers a searing amount of detail and clarity in his own childhood memories. In his film-grained semi-autobiographical drama “Armageddon Time,” Gray captures these images with both period-specific accuracy and a lens of personal introspection and accountability.
The personal screen memoir meditates on white privilege and racial prejudice in pre-Reagan America, told through the eyes of 12-year-old Paul Graff (Banks Repeta), Gray’s fictional counterpart, as he grows up in Queens, N.Y. in 1980 with his parents (Anne Hathaway and Jeremy Strong), his brother (Ryan Sell) and his multi-generational Jewish relatives (led by Anthony Hopkins).
Paul is friends with his Black schoolmate, Johnny (Jaylin Webb), with whom he bonds over their dreams — Paul aspires to be an artist and Johnny dreams of moving to Florida to work for NASA. They enjoy being class clowns together, but Johnny receives harsher discouragement and punishment for his actions from their school teacher than Paul does. When Paul’s parents switch him to a preparatory academy helmed by Maryanne Trump (Jessica Chastain) after an incident involving him and Johnny, their friendship is put to the test. As Paul is thrust into a sphere of heightened privilege and is told by his parents to no longer associate with Johnny, he begins to recognize the injustices that exist in the systems that benefit him and faces the decision to assimilate or resist the status quo.
At first, the film comes across as a warm, aging deck of photographs and slides thanks to its cozy production design utilizing warm autumnal hues and the aesthetics of early 1980’s East Coast prep. Yet, its stylistic details come to both contrast with and complement the coldness of its thematic truth and achieve a cinematic harmony that captures everything Gray has felt. Instead of reveling in a story of what could very easily be a nostalgia-coated portrait of his childhood, Gray questions everything he once knew as a young boy and invites us to examine both his own past mistakes and the United States’ previous, and relevant, failings of minorities.
The family scenes are some of the film’s most memorable, featuring standout supporting performances from Strong and Hathaway that are as hilarious just as they are terrifying from a child’s perspective. Gray figuratively opens the doors of Paul’s childhood home to his audience and welcomes them in to witness slices of his life: family dinner gatherings, political banter in front of the television and tales of Jewish relatives who immigrated to America. But Gray also looks beyond the world of his middle-class New York suburb to examine the promises of the American Dream. Paul’s wise and empathetic grandfather Aaron, played by Hopkins in a lovely performance, narrates the histories of anti-Semitism in Europe and stories of his own relatives through bedtime stories.
What must not go unnoticed are the leading performances of Banks and Webb, incredible young talents whose on screen friendship authentically captures the wide-eyed wonder of youth and the temptation of independence. Both actors portray the inherent innocence of childhood with captivating authenticity while simultaneously coping with the injustices of racism and complexities of class and privilege.
The eclectic selection of music is also a standout. It feels as if Gray had found an old box filled with his family’s record collection and curated it into the film’s groovy and punk soundtrack — from The Clash to The Sugarhill Gang, even featuring a piece from Tchaikovsky’s gracefully cinematic ‘Swan Lake.’ To complement the funky tones is an acoustic guitar score from Christopher Spelman that captures both the sentimentality of the past and Gray’s brutally reflective honesty and regret.
What makes “Armageddon Time” so effective is Gray playing out his nearly autobiographical story as it happened, sufficing nothing, and allows us to sit with what we saw. Yet with its themes of the hope of the American Dream — and how it may fail us — and the tragedy of systemic failure, it is evident that Gray hopes to encourage that we do our own reflecting.
“Armageddon Time” is soulfully encapsulating in its specificity of detail and simplicity of heart. It is nothing short of an emotionally moving experience, hitting all the right notes of the triumph of love and devastation of regret. Gray commands his story with a gravity of intimacy that feels almost voyeuristic on the viewer’s part, but welcomed with open arms, making for one of the most moving cinematic experiences of the year.
“Armageddon Time” opens in limited theaters Oct. 28 and will open nationwide Nov. 4.

Let’s be honest, we weren’t made to be monolithic experts in our major. No one is a born economist, engineer or historian. People are quick to label themselves, “not a math person” or “more artsy.” It’s no wonder then that people assume that general education courses are a waste of time. 
However, the way we try to pigeon-hole ourselves into a label is delusional. I get it — we desire a sense of belonging and identity, especially with the capitalistic and societal pressures to make a name for ourselves. 
I met a mechanical engineering student who professed to me that artistic endeavors are wasted efforts. In his mind, his field of study was what was truly important and the most useful. He expressed to me that if society focused only on STEM fields, we’d be a lot further along — as if progress precluded expression and play. However, I realized these analogous stories existed in other majors, too. We’ve all spoken to a student majoring in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences that had a bit too many perspectives and passions on things they’ve never actually experienced. I mean, at least their heart is in the right place? 
Surely there’s a way to alleviate these issues though? These are soon-to-be college graduates that will go out into the world, impacting policies, the environment and society. Yet, there are so many dangerous gaps in their beliefs. The way we can fill in these gaps is already in front of us — interdisciplinary or holistic studies, otherwise known as general education courses. 
It is necessary to interact across departments, rather than soaking in the cumbersome paradigm given by default in our respective majors. Do you really think a Marshall School of Business major is likely to educate you on the importance of non-performative social impact ventures? Though, these arguments just further feed into the narrative of turning us into effective capitalists. What about living? What about passion?  
Truth be told, we have a human spirit and we are multifaceted with many interests — interests that many of us have squashed a long time ago in order to fit into the roles into which society wants to siphon us. Regardless, these interests will continue to persevere within us, a weak ember still flickering in our souls until our death beds. If you ever caught your dad in your room using your wardrobe to look like a teenage skater boy, complete with fingerless gloves, that’s what that was about. Midlife crises typically involve pursuing long forgotten interests; they never fade.
Boo happiness, boo passion, you may be saying. What about the point of college? What about actually getting a job? Okay, you’re right. At the end of the day, we need to compromise, because after all, we live in a society. But take Colman Domingo — perhaps you recognize him as Ali Muhammad from “Euphoria” — for example. Domingo pursued a journalism degree from Temple University. After undertaking an acting class as an elective, he was approached by his professor, who asked him if he had considered it as a career. This conversation transformed Domingo’s trajectory as he dropped out a few units short of graduating and went on to pursue acting instead. Domingo was able to build a successful career off of a single transformative elective class. I’d say college served its purpose for Domingo; he was able to receive a very impactful education and also get a job, albeit one not in the field of study he had originally pursued.
To better serve ourselves and society, we need to remind ourselves of the purpose of college. It’s most definitely not to become an autonomous robot with an unusually obsessive interest in our area of study. It’s to receive an education that enriches our lives. We need to ask ourselves when college became a rush towards a career we’ll be in for the next 45 years anyway, and why general education courses are considered a distraction rather than enrichment. From there, we’ll be able to pave a way forward to an education that is truly educational.

Imagine standing in an ancient library on a chilly fall evening. Under the dim, soft lights, one can hear spooky music and low whispers coming from afar. Flip through the pages of a vintage book, decrypt the author’s handwritten message or uncover the tragedy that haunted the master of Rugby School in 1856. 
Co-hosted by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Department of History and USC Libraries Thursday, Doheny After Dark was a Halloween-themed case-solving experience for history lovers and adventurers. The event took place at Doheny Memorial Library and offered participants a journey back in time to uncover the mysteries of the past.
During this journey, participants collaborated in teams and tried to solve eight cases, each tied to one or several vintage books or documents related to this year’s theme: witchcraft. Students could browse through different copies of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” or read about early writings regarding on the “Illusions of the Demons” or on “Spells and Poisons.” In another challenge, students needed to identify the owners of two locks of hair, which is often believed to have magical qualities and is often kept after death to hold onto the memory of those passed.
In order to find more evidence, students also need to find clues scattered across different places that are often inconspicuous in the library. One of these places was the “bookstacks,” which hold a majority of Doheny’s collections. Students can access this area through the doorway behind the front desk and take the elevator to go to different levels. However, unlike Doheny’s top study spaces, such as the Los Angeles Times Reference Room, the bookstacks remain largely unknown to many USC students.
Associate professor of history Lindsay O’Neill was one of the main organizers of the event, and mentioned that she had a set of students who didn’t know where the bookstacks were or that they existed. Therefore, she said that Doheny After Dark is “supposed to be fun, but it’s also supposed to be educational, and [help you] get to know your local library.”
The highlight of the event was the diversity of publications chosen from USC Special Collections. Besides books, film scripts and play scripts, an anthology of letters were also given to appeal to participants with a variety of interests. The texts were not all written in English either — some of the original works were presented in languages such as French, German and Latin. Although students were allowed to look up translations online, decrypting these different forms of writings and understanding different languages required the participants to be patient and precise. The process of identifying the language and locating clues in the texts also brought valuable practice to their attentiveness and focus on details. 
O’Neill hopes that the event will help students learn more about the resources available at Special Collections. According to the USC Libraries website, USC Special Collections “oversees the University’s primary source collections including archives, manuscripts, historic photographs, and rare books.” These materials can serve as primary sources for students, faculty, and others to carry out research and creative projects. O’Neill said that she and the supporters in Special Collections wanted to open up more parts of the Special Collections to students. 
“One of the Special Collections librarians is very interested in Halloween, and we were like, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do a Halloween event?’” O’Neill said. “And so we decided that, instead of just pulling items and having a couple of items that relate to Halloween that students could look at, it’d be more interesting if we could turn it into a series of challenges and make it more interactive and fun.”
Student participants such as Bella Shahani also had a good experience at Doheny After Dark. Shahani, a junior majoring in history, learned about the event from both email and Instagram, enjoyed being in Special Collections and found the Halloween theme to be really interesting. 
“I think that’s fun! It’s a good way to meet new people,” Shahani said about the event and getting to collaborate with others during the challenge. 
Valeria Huerta, an undecided sophomore, expressed her fondness for the event, including figuring out what clues to look for and answering questions through looking at vintage books. Her favorite part was getting to explore other parts of the library. 
“I really liked when we have to look for the book, like we have the book here and we have to go to the bookstacks to find the book and find the note,” Huerta said. “I guess we really have to come together as a team.” 
This was the third year since Doheny After Dark started, and O’Neill hopes it will become an annual event and to expand the size of the challenge. 
“I like it when I can utilize the larger library more, so if I can find things, that’s cool… [the event] will probably remain relatively similar,” she said. “My big hope is that we can just keep offering [Doheny After Dark] year after year, so it becomes an annual event.”

It was April 2022. Coachella was in full swing. My roommates and I, clad in glitter and our finest outfits, were prepared for what was obviously going to be the best three days of our lives — or, at least, everyone else was going to believe it was. After sipping seltzers and snapping photos, we headed to the festival. 
It was an exhausting euphoria, but a euphoria nonetheless. Many of my favorite artists collected into one place, and it was an excuse to show everyone how great I looked. What could be better? For many, Coachella is less about its sonic experience than about how it presents itself on Instagram. 
This preoccupation with sharing the experience online was something of which I was well aware and in which I was actively participatory. That was, until I headed to the stage for Phoebe Bridgers’ set and realized my phone had been snatched. Having left my computer at USC, I remarked with horror that I would be off the grid for 72 hours. How was I going to contact my family? What if I lost my friends? But most importantly, how would I capture how great of a time I was having? 
The first two problems were quickly alleviated, with my roommate promising me use of her phone for a quick text to my parents that I wasn’t dead and that we would remain together. As for the latter, I remembered that also in my pack was my prized possession: my Canon Z-135 film camera. 
In 2007, Apple released the iPhone, beginning the shift of a ubiquitous ability to have a little functioning computer in your pocket. With each release of their newest version, there were marked improvements in its technology, particularly with the camera. With each of these updates, carrying a separate camera became increasingly obsolete for everyone except professional photographers. This trend, combined with the ongoing shift to digital media, was seemingly the nail in the coffin for analog photography. In 2012, photography legend Kodak even filed for bankruptcy. 
Yet, despite what seemed like the end, film is back and better than ever. Starting in 2014, film distributors have seen a comeback of the film market. Hashtags like #filmisnotdead continue to trend (over 23 million posts on Instagram) and film cameras have risen in price. Whether it’s because of the aesthetic of film photos, a longing for the past or a combination of some of these or any other factor, one can only speculate. However, film photography’s resurgence is, in today’s sphere, a needed exercise of an increasingly infrequent occurrence of delayed gratification. 
We live in an age where everything is instant. Craving Chipotle? With a few taps of a screen, a burrito bowl is at your door in 30 minutes. Feeling lonely or sexually deprived? A few lucky right swipes and you can be at someone’s door by the end of the night. In California, there are even multiple apps for cannabis delivery. 
This phenomenon extends past Postmates and Tinder. This need for immediacy is extremely prevalent in the ability to snap a plethora of digital photos and the desire of many to perform perfection on digital platforms. With the capacity to snap 100 photos in 10 seconds, we find ourselves scrutinizing and analyzing every single angle and contortion of one’s body and face, in an effort to seek out the perfect shot to match that of those in your feed of any and everyone else.
Even apps that attempt to combat this, particularly the smash popular app BeReal, has lent itself to performance. What is seemingly the imposed shame of posting late or of letting people know what you’re doing at a more opportune moment, does not seem to faze users who would rather let others into their life when they’re looking better and being much more interesting. Sentiments of “Ugh, I wish my BeReal notification was going off NOW” echo this desire of perfect performance, of a need to constantly be interesting in order to deliver a more appealing message of one’s life. 
Film photography combats all of that. With a limited number of photos per roll (24 or 36 for refillable point and shoot, and 27 or 36 for disposable cameras), the medium lends itself to only capturing one photo per moment. Furthermore, the lack of instancy — the need to wait and see what the photos look like — allows one to simply exist in the moment they are in without a need to analyze their actions and appearance through how it manifests in a JPEG. It allows one to capture a moment and see how it looks later on, as opposed to instantly, while simultaneously creating excitement for when photos are later developed.
In a world which revolves around instant gratification and how we appear digitally, film photography is a tool that concurrently combats the need for perfection and immediacy. My Coachella weekend truly did end up being one of the best of my life, mainly in part to not spending the weekend watching the festival through other’s photos. I was fully immersed in the experience. It was my own, for my eyes and for the sparse moments captured by my Canon only.

USC quarterback Caleb Williams threw for a career-high 411 yards and 5 touchdowns to lead the Trojans to victory over University of Arizona Saturday. Thanks to the Trojans’ defensive struggles, the Wildcats kept the game competitive until the final possession of the 45-37 shootout.
As usual, the Trojans made quick work on offense, scoring on their first 3 possessions. The absence of star receivers junior Jordan Addison and sophomore Mario Williams was noticeable, as several other pass-catchers had breakout days. 
Among those was redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington, who hauled 7 passes for 118 yards and 2 touchdowns. Fellow redshirt junior Kyle Ford also had an impressive night with 6 catches for 114 yards and a score.
“Sometimes when you don’t have your top two guys, you get to spread the ball around a little bit more,” Williams said. “The other team can’t key in on anybody else. I put the ball where I thought was best, and those guys made some good catches.”
Redshirt senior running back Travis Dye once again led the Trojan rushing attack, carrying the ball 20 times for 113 yards and a touchdown. The contest marked his fifth 100-yard performance this season, with 760 yards across eight games.
But USC’s defensive struggles kept Arizona in the game until the final possession, with Williams sneaking across the line of scrimmage on fourth and short to deny the Wildcats another possession before time expired. Arizona sophomore quarterback Jayden de Laura threw for 380 yards and 3 touchdowns, adding 54 yards on the ground.
“We gave up too many big plays,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley. “We were scoring pretty quick offensively, so it became that kind of game for a little bit, but we got the key stops when we needed to.”
The Wildcats’ passing attack centered on sophomore wide receiver Dorian Singer, who tallied 141 yards and saw the endzone three times. Singer put Arizona on the board with the game’s first touchdown with a one-handed grab through tight coverage from sophomore defensive back Jaylin Smith midway through the first quarter.
“You’ve got to give them credit,” said Riley. “They made some unbelievable plays, especially in the first half.”
While Arizona only held the lead for a short period in the first quarter following their opening possession, USC continued to allow the Wildcats to play catch up — only forcing one turnover in the first half. The Wildcats had their way with USC’s defense and at one point scored on two straight possessions to erase the Trojans’ lead from 15 to 2 as the third quarter came to an end.
But the Trojan offense saved the day and dug the team out of their slump with touchdowns on 2 straight possessions to reclaim a demanding lead. Although they forced a punt between said touchdowns, USC’s defense allowed one final Wildcats touchdown, forcing the Trojans to defend their lead on offense with 1:26 left in the game.
While struggles on defense may not be new this season, the Trojans had trouble in a usually confident realm of their game in Tucson: special teams. Freshman placekicker Denis Lynch missed 2 of his 3 field goals on the day, from 56 and 39 yards, respectively. Saturday marked Lynch’s third miss under 40 yards this season, the first two coming in September against Stanford and Oregon State.
Despite some challenges, Riley was still proud of his team’s performance.
“The number of things that didn’t go our way was a long list,” Riley said, “ I don’t know many teams that would’ve responded like this.”
The victory brings Southern Cal to 7-1, 5-1 in Pac-12 play, while the Wildcats fall to 3-5, 1-4.  The Trojans will take on UC Berkeley  Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m.

Whether crucially intrinsic to football rivalries in general or consequences of inherent human conditions, ideological differences and political contests rear their enigmatic head within most football rivalries. Socioeconomic classes and cultural or political discrepancies ultimately precede most football rivalries. As previously mentioned through my column centering on Spain’s El Clásico rivalry between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, such rivalries necessitate some type of differences or animosity, or else there would not be such hostility. 
Intra-city rivalries present heightened tensions due to immediate adjacency between bitter opponents, as opposed to derbies consisting of teams representative of different cities. Spectators witness identical sociopolitical dynamics in a confined and immediate setting. The two most coveted football clubs in Argentina, Boca Juniors and River Plate, borrow Buenos Aires’ full attention in the superclásico. The clubs’ immediate adjacency and rivalry’s extensive history explain the number of riots caused by the meeting. The Argentine derby is only one of the more predominant and comprehensive examples of inter-city rivalries.
However, although rare, a few intra-city rivals share stadiums with their forbidden adversaries. Interestingly, most of the well-recognized examples come from Italy’s top-flight football. From the heated Milan exhibition between AC Milan and Internazionale in the San Siro stadium to the burgeoning rivalry between Hellas Verona and Chievo in the Stadio Marc’Antonio Bentegodi, Italy is home to rare displays of intra-city rivalries within shared stadiums. However, Italy’s fiercest football intra-city clash occurs in Rome’s Stadio Olimpico between polar opposite A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio, and will again steal headlines this Sunday. 
Rivalry Origins
The derby’s initial makings began in 1927 after a three-club merger that created A.S. Roma to compete with professional clubs hailing from Northern cities. The controversial unification alienated fellow Roman club S.S. Lazio, who resisted the merger and sought club independence. Although A.S. Roma and S.S Lazio fans predominantly share identical political ideologies, the media has noted a traditional, working-class profile among A.S. Roma fans, who hail from inner-city districts, and a far-right, wealthier identity among S.S. Lazio supporters.
Suffice it to say, the differences between club supporters originate from perceptions of the other group’s Roman identity: A.S. Roma fans identify as true Romans and perceive S.S. Lazio fans as outsiders and vice versa.     
Recent Clashes
Due to the rivalry’s cultural genesis and origin, respective supporters have clashed and been involved in acts of violence. In 1979, Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli was fatally struck in the eye with a flare directed by a Roma fan in the Stadio Olimpico, causing Italy’s first football-related casualty. Following a rumor that a boy had been killed outside the stadium during a 2004 meeting, riots began within the Stadio Olimpico stands. Fifteen supporters were arrested and 24 people were hurt as a result of the commotion. 
Unfortunately, especially among Italy ultra fan groups, racism and ignorance continue to be utilized as a vehicle for supporters. In 2017, Lazio fans infamously created stickers and graffiti art depicting holocaust victim Anne Frank donning a Roma jersey. One of Lazio’s highest regarded football players, Paolo Di Canio, was a self-professed fascist and Benito Mussolini admirer. In January 2005, Di Canio infamously celebrated a goal against A.S. Roma with a straight salute reminiscent of the contentious Nazi salute.  
The Rome Derby as a Microcosm 
Besides the belligerent clashes between Roman clubs fueled by cultural and socioeconomic class differences and racist sentiments among ultra supporters, the Rome derby, similar to all football rivalries, serves as a microcosm. Specifically, the derby arguably exposes the consequences of perverted, misplaced regional patriotism and again discloses racism stemming from territorial nationalism. 
However, an integral absence of knowledge may be obfuscating a genuine assessment of the derby. To many Romans, the rivalry may signify a much more profound meaning. Regardless, Italy’s fiercest rivalry will continue stoking resentment and hostility between the two Roman clubs.
