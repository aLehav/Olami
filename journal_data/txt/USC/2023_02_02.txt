Students gathered at Tommy’s Place Wednesday to kick off Black History Month, beginning a month-long celebration of Black voices, contributions and stories. 
President Carol Folt spoke at the event, highlighting the importance of the celebration. She was joined by Greedley Harris from the Center for Black and Cultural Student Affairs and Reverend Brandon Harris from the Office of Religious Life. 
“Today, we’re coming together to remember our history,” Folt said. “[We’re] paying tribute to people whose lives give us hope and to demonstrate the power of individuals to inspire meaningful change.”
Folt brought attention to Black student and alumni achievements, ranging from contributions to the Martin Luther King exhibit at the Fisher Museum of Art to the rechristening of Cromwell Field to Allyson Felix Field, honoring the five-time Olympian and 11-time Olympic medalist. Toward the end of her speech, Folt quoted Felix’s 2022 commencement speech.
“[Felix] told us to ‘use our voices to fight for our ideals and our values — even,’ as she said, ‘—   if they shake,’” Folt said.
Danielle Harvey, associate vice president for alumni relations and the interim executive director for the Black Alumni Association, helped organize the event. Folt and Harvey wanted to keep student safety in mind amid the ongoing pandemic, while also maximizing the number of people that could attend, so they implemented a hybrid model.
“The folks at the Center for Black and Cultural Student Affairs worked together to stream the virtual event and bring people together in person to watch it,” Harvey said. “It’s really a work of love across the campus.”
The event also showcased local small businesses such as LA Grind Coffee and Tea Bar, which served various flavored teas and lemonade, and Rosalind’s Restaurant, which served an Ethiopian meal.
Harvey said she wanted to emphasize the importance of celebrating Black achievements and history in the face of current attempts to stifle them, specifically Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ recent move to strip the AP African American studies curriculum. 
“[Ron DeSantis is] really working hard to erase what African Americans have contributed to the United States and their history here for the last 500 years,” Harvey said.
What became Black History Month began in 1915 when Harvard University alum Carter G. Woodson and minister Jesse Moorland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History — known today as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History — to research and recognize the achievements of Black people. 
In 1926, the ASALH created Negro History Week, which took place the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and notable abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Eventually, former president Gerald Ford recognized Black History Month as an event beginning in 1976.
Lillian Leonard, a senior majoring in public relations, said she believes it’s critical to celebrate Black achievements and embrace the contributions that Black individuals have made to U.S. culture.
“It’s very important to highlight [Black achievements] and really give a platform to specific individuals who carried us through a lot,” Leonard said.
Mai-Yen Fritz, a senior majoring in neuroscience, said that Black History Month is a time when she can embrace her identity completely, as she feels it’s not socially acceptable to freely express herself in any month other than February. 
“I’m having to watch how I speak out,” Fritz said. “[It’s] mostly just being silenced in a lot of public spaces, not surrounded by people who look like me.”

The Trojan Guardian Scholars program moved from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences to its new home at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work has been finalized, a process that began last May.
USC’s Guardian Scholars program was founded in 2014 by Wendy Smith, former associate dean of Planning and Curriculum Development at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, with the intention of finding ways to assist those who had experienced foster care in becoming “successful members of the academic community.” While officially launched through Dornsife, Dworak-Peck was already involved, as students in the Master of Social Work program provided counseling to TGS students in the early days of the program.
Now, the program has transitioned from involving Dworak-Peck to being a part of it. Professor Sara McSweyn, the TGS program coordinator, said the faculty’s knowledge and understanding of the foster care system will be an asset to TGS.
“What we like about it being at USC School of Social Work is that history, that tradition of academic work, research, and very thorough and a deep understanding of the experience of foster care,” McSweyn said. “We can leverage the knowledge base, the values of our profession and fold them into the work that we do with this population of students.”
Beth Lucas, an alum from Dworak-Peck and practical instructor for TGS, said an advantage of the program being housed at Dworak-Peck is the faculty’s understanding of trauma. Oftentimes, students who are impacted by trauma do not realize it until they receive help from a professional — such as a social worker — to uncover the root of their problems, Lucas said.
“As social workers, we’re trained to look at the whole person to understand what their background is and if they are addressing some type of problem, how that is linked to their past experiences,” Lucas said. 
McSweyn said Dworak-Peck would provide additional resources to the program, such as a dedicated Trojan Guardianship center, complete with a fridge, microwave and desktop computer. 
Under Dornsife, TGS shared a hub with the First Generation Student Center. McSweyn said that, although that student center was a valuable resource, these two groups of students do not always overlap, making the creation of a TGS space vital.
In addition to the new hub for the program, Lucas said that Dworak-Peck has been immensely beneficial to the program, with faculty from all areas of expertise coming together to assist with grant writing, fundraising and event planning. 
“The dedication from [Dworak-Peck] has been overwhelming,” Lucas said. “The support we’ve been getting … is just going to propel the program to the next level and provide even more opportunities for our students.”

I watched Netflix’s “Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure” when it was first released on Dec. 13. The show, an animated television series about a lazy egg who is roped into a chick’s quest to find its mother, spoke to me. In the teaser trailer, Gudetama, the titular lazy egg, is born proclaiming life to be “a drag.” In another trailer, Gudetama apathetically declares that it is just “living life by going with the flow.” 
“That’s literally me,” I told my mom, my housemate and anyone else who would listen about my striking resemblance to Gudetama.
Gudetama actually is me. The yellow Sanrio blob from Japan has been credited with becoming a “cultural phenomenon” by publications like Vox. Its ability to make laziness its entire personality resonates with viewers. That’s what Gudetama is known for: being lazy. It doesn’t seem to have any goal in life other than rejecting hard work that is perceived as pointless. 
Throughout the television series, Gudetama is dragged about to various locations by its friend, Shakipiyo. The egg doesn’t serve as an active presence in the adventure and, if non-participation was an award, it would win the grand prize. 
Besides my physical appearance (there have been a few times where I lie in bed typing sentences of these columns on my phone, assuming the literal pose of Gudetama) I’ve started to notice that I’m turning to the philosophy of Gudetama more and more. Why? It’s hard being a college student sometimes. 
Of course, I’m grateful for the chance to be at USC and get my education. As someone who was rejected from USC my senior year of high school, I constantly marvel at how I coped with that gut-wrenching feeling. I used hard work to prove myself and successfully transferred to USC. At that time, my solution to my sadness was to work. Now, it’d probably be to merely lie on the bed and cry. 
A time comes when you don’t want to try so hard anymore, especially when you feel like you’re not getting much in return. In my senior year of high school, trying hard meant carefully crafting each word in each essay of every college application. 
When I didn’t get into my top choices and experienced the disdain that came after from my peers, it felt like I was always putting 100% effort into everything and not getting 100% back from the world. Classmates would tell me that I was acting entitled by expecting college decisions to go my way, considering my subpar grades. As I was drowning in my negativity, I couldn’t help but feel like that was the point of my hard work. If trying hard doesn’t get you to the point you want, then why try hard in the first place? 
Trying hard doesn’t end after getting into college. Now, it’s rewriting cover letters for internship and full-time job applications, sending out hundreds to not hear back. It’s being in interviews and trying not to come across as a try-hard, forcing yourself to seem effortless even when you care so deeply about the job. When your attempts to present yourself as the perfect candidate don’t work, you reflect back on your interview. You realize that, in your excitement for the job, your nervous energy probably made the panel mistake you as being “weird.” 
Just after you get a rejection from your dream internship, you receive an essay back in class with row upon row of comments in red. Even when you know this is part of life, all these rejections, you can’t help but think: Why am I not good enough?
Gudetama, with all its nihilistic proclamations of not caring and simply eating and sleeping, has become my go-to solution in moments like these. After all, sending applications out into the void and seeking validation isn’t sustainable when validation is so hard to come by. Rather than worrying about curating every aspect of myself for peers, employers and family, I’d rather just “go with the flow” as Gudetama does.
So I find myself just lying in bed, pondering the prospect of unemployment after graduation.  It’s exhausting caring so much that you just don’t want to care at all.
A serial LinkedIn connector might disagree with me. Working hard and networking will always help in the long run, no matter how long it takes, someone might say. You do you — I’m tired. I don’t feel like trying to artificially strike up conversations with people when I know that I can’t do anything for them. I don’t want to care as much about whether or not people see me as a product that can help them. 
Maybe the grind never stops. Just for now, I’m going to take a break from that grind. A break from comparing myself to others who have gotten their dream jobs and their dream futures. A break from trying hard to the point where what I want comes before myself. It’s better for my mental health that way: a form of self-care, like Gudetama is for so many others. Let me be Gudetama, just for a bit. 
I’m going to stop writing now. It’s time for me to take a nap.

I wake up early to drive into town before the tourist traffic hits. It’s fall break, and I’m home for the 50th Annual Art & Pumpkin Festival that hasn’t happened since the coronavirus pandemic began. I’m driving past the Jetty, past the sign made by friends for a life lost too soon a few years back. I’m rolling the windows down to breathe in the salty air one last time before I go back to Los Angeles for school. I’m turning into the parking lot where I had my first date with an old friend back when we were in middle school. I’m walking in the middle of the closed down intersection right before Main Street begins — eyes up, hands bundled in pockets against the cold, familiar faces smiling and laughing everywhere my eyes lead me. 
I walk past booth after booth to find a friend from home, who I hadn’t seen since the summer, selling handmade jewelry to patrons of the festival. I’ve worn the half moon necklace she gave me every day since I got it. 
I run into the parents of friends, old classmates, kids I used to babysit, teachers, coaches; all of the people in this community who raised me to be the person I am today. 
As I drive home before departing for L.A., I sit in silence. I’m scanning the rolling green farms and fog-covered hills, memorizing the way the sun pokes through the trees before the right turn into my neighborhood. I’m smiling to myself because of how grateful I am to be from where I’m from, but tears are streaming down my face because I have to say goodbye. 
I’m from a town that no one has heard of. A place you’ve only been to if you’ve driven through it on your way to San Francisco, a place you’ve only seen if you keep up with big wave surfing or agriculture in the form of pumpkins. 
People who know me know that my town is a piece of my identity. I lived in the same house for my entire life. I went to public school no more than seven miles from my childhood bedroom. I took my first steps there, learned my first words there and I am the way that I am because of my town. 
I drove the same stretch of Highway 1 every day during the pandemic to drive myself away from the anxieties I felt when the world was falling apart. I went to the same grocery store in hopes of running into anyone who could give me hope — my old math teacher, my older brother’s Little League teammate, who happened to also be at his wedding last year, friends who I haven’t seen since I left for college. 
This community is unmatched in everything that the word “community” stands for. 
And now, this community is on the front page of news outlets like CNN, The New York Times and BBC. And it’s not because the record for the largest pumpkin ever grown was broken. 
It’s because hearts are broken. 
On Jan. 23, days after the Monterey Park shooting took 11 lives less than 15 miles away from USC, a mass shooting killed seven innocent people in my hometown, Half Moon Bay. 
This town has been ravaged by the pandemic, by storms that started sinkholes and shredded coastal cliffs, by a lacking tourism and agriculture-based economy that can’t properly fund schools — and now by gun violence. 
You never think it could happen to you, and then in a span of three days it happens in the two most important places you’ve lived. 
When I was a senior in high school, my best friend and I were tasked with writing a graduation speech as co-student body presidents. We wrote our first draft and our teacher handed it back to us. 
“Go further,” he said. 
The reason that our speech had every person in the audience in tears was not because we were graduating, not because I admitted to my entire graduating class that I went to therapy, not because all the people we loved were in the same place. It was because of how much we love our town and because no matter how badly we all wanted to get out, we still couldn’t bear to leave. 
This town raised me just like it raised every single person who has the privilege of saying they’re from Half Moon Bay. And when something that raised you is in danger, nothing feels the way that it should. 
I never thought that gun violence would happen to the place I have to point out on a map for most people I introduce myself to. 
I never thought I would send out calls and texts to assure myself that everyone I knew was alive. 
I never thought that the lockdown drills we practiced in school would ever be more than just drills. 
My perfect little town is broken. I feel helpless and hopeless in the face of people with more power and deeper pockets who are making decisions that make people die. 
This is why gun violence has to end. This is why gun control in the United States should be non-negotiable. 
The U.S. holds about 5% of the world’s total population, yet that 5% owns 46% of the world’s civilian-owned guns, according to the Small Arms Survey based in Switzerland. The U.S. also has the highest homicide-by-firearm rate in the world’s most-developed nations. Of the eight U.S. states with the most strict gun restrictions, six of those states are at the bottom of the firearm mortality rate scale. These relationships speak for themselves – places with stricter laws on guns have less mass shootings. 
The U.S. will never completely abolish guns – only a small percentage of countries have succeeded in that – however, there is an opportunity to make real change with increased gun control laws. 
More people are dying every day, in every state, in every small town. 
You can’t imagine that it’s you until it is you.

With the bustling award season singing “au revoir’’ to the films of 2022, the Sundance Film Festival cut the ribbon for another year of new films. Entering its 38th year, the festival returned in-person to the snowy mountains of Park City, Utah for the first time since 2020. Providing up-and-coming filmmakers the opportunity to showcase their indie films to major distributors, such as Netflix or Apple, Sundance has become one of the most celebrated festivals in Hollywood. Films such as Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash (2014) and the most recent Academy Award Best Picture Winner CODA (2021) emerged from this festival, which has garnered major prestige over the years. Embracing diverse voices and stories, it has played a seminal role in redefining the identity of the film industry. Based on all the buzz coming out of Sundance this year, here are some of my most anticipated films: 
“Fair Play”
Scoring a $20 million distribution deal with Netflix, USC alum Chloe Domont’s debut feature “Fair Play” has been the biggest success story out of Sundance this year. A finance drama with a romantic thriller twist, “Fair Play” is about the downfall of a New York couple’s marriage as they fight tooth and nail for a promotion at a hedge fund company. Focusing on modern sexual politics and the toxicity of corporate workplaces, Domont wowed audiences with her timely script that subtly comments on today’s culture. The powerful and sensual performances of Alden Ehrenriech, known for his role as young Han Solo in “Solo: A Star Wars Story’’ (2018),  and Phoebe Dynevor, fresh off her success in Netflix’s “Bridgerton,’’ only heightened the excitement and hype surrounding this film. Keep an eye out for its release on Netflix later this year. 
“Past Lives”
In contrast to the tense and toxic relationship of “Fair Play,” A24’s “Past Lives” provides a more sentimental and poignant perspective of love and friendship. Already deemed by some trade articles as one of the biggest awards contenders of 2023, “Past Lives” touched the hearts of Sundance audiences through its story of unrequited love and heartbreak. Written and directed by Korean Canadian playwright Celine Song, “Past Lives” tracks the wavering romance between two childhood friends, as they continually drift apart and reconnect over the course of three stages in their lives. Compared to the achingly tragic and sentimental tones of films, such as Wong Kar-Wai’s “In the Mood for Love” (2000)  and Jacques Demy’s “Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964), Song explores how love, fate and identity intertwine through her subtle dialogue and dreamlike aesthetics. 
“The Eternal Memory”
Sundance is known for its debut of diverse documentaries that, more often than not, become Academy Award winners. This year Chilean filmmaker Maite Alberdi, who premiered her first film at Sundance in 2020, comes back to the festival with another touching and meditative documentary called “The Eternal Memory.” This is a follow-up to “The Mole Agent,” her Oscar-nominated documentary about a secret investigation of a retirement home in Chile (and one of my favorite films of 2020). “The Eternal Memory” grapples with similar existential questions that arise as we age and slowly lose control over our minds and bodies. This time Alberdi focuses on an elderly Chilean couple’s journey in dealing with Alzheimer’s disease. Once a prominent Chilean cultural commentator who fought to preserve the art and history of the nation after Pinchoet’s destructive dictatorship, Augusto now has to fight to keep his memory and identity alive with the support and love of his wife Paulina. Lauded for its unfiltered and authentic reflections on love, life and death, “The Eternal Memory” seems like another great showcase of Alberdi’s talent as a filmmaker. 
“Shayda”
Winning the Audience Award in the World Cinema category at Sundance, “Shayda,” directed by Iranian Australian filmmaker Noora Niasari, is an emotionally powerful film that sheds light on the barriers women encounter when escaping abusive relationships. The film follows the titular protagonist’s fight for autonomy as she flees from Iran to Australia. Shayda leaves with her daughter to avoid her violent husband, whom she can’t divorce due to restrictive Iranian laws. Noted for her strong performance, Zar Amir Ebrahimi, who won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival last year, exemplifies the courage and tenacity of Shayda’s character. Despite dealing with traumatic subject matters, Niasari centralizes the story on how Shayda and her daughter find moments of happiness and peace in a world built against them. Through her poetic and quiet scenes, Niasari was praised for capturing the beauty and resilience of a mother-daughter love. In lieu of the Iranian government’s most recent violations of women’s rights, this film plays an important role in uplifting the stories of Iranian women whose voices have been silenced for too long. 
“You Hurts My Feelings” 
Sundance veteran Nicole Holofcener’s returns to the festival with the premiere of her newest film, “You Hurt My Feelings.” Known for films such as “Enough Said” (2013) and “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” (2018), Holofcener has established herself as a clever and witty writer. She succeeds in crafting intimate stories that focus on human vulnerabilities and loneliness. Following the thematic strains established in her past films, “You Hurt My Feelings” manifests every romantic partner’s greatest fear: betrayal. After years of working alongside her husband on her upcoming novel, Beth, played by the impeccably funny Julia Louis-Dreyfus, overhears her husband, played by Tobias Menzies, harshly critiquing her new work behind her back. This one conversation causes Beth to spiral into an existential crisis, forcing her to reconsider her marriage and her career as writer. Dealing with themes of authenticity and honesty in relationships, Holofcener succeeds in creating flawed yet relatable characters, who deal with insecurities we have all faced at some point in our lives. With Louis-Dreyfus’ comedic chops and Holofcener sharp yet touching dialogue, “You Hurt My Feelings” is on the top of my watch-list.

If popular movies and television media dictated identity, asexuality probably wouldn’t exist. Excluding “Bojack Horseman,” the word “asexual” is occasionally alluded to but seldom uttered in the mainstream media. A group of USC students is hoping to change that. 
An exploration of asexuality and a critique of religious purity culture, “Welcome to Celibacy Club” is a coming-of-age comedic short film that follows the journey of an asexual teenager feeling lost in her identity, searching for community. Eventually, she lands on joining her high school’s celibacy club. 
Screenwriter Nina Lu, who identifies as demisexual, first learned about asexuality in high school. However, she did not accept her identity after her classmates said that asexuality was “not a real sexuality.” It was only once she arrived at college that she was able to embrace her identity. 
“I wish that these people just had better representation at all,” said Lu, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting. “Because yeah, I guess if I could have known about [asexuality] earlier as a valid thing … it could have just made things make a lot more sense for me earlier.”
After Lu approached Murleve Roberts, co-screenwriter, proposing they write a script together, Roberts, who identifies as demisexual, “instantly” knew they should write a story about asexual identity. 
“I remember throwing out this idea of nuns. I feel like if I were in the olden times, I would become a nun,” said Roberts, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting. “Because I would just I naturally be like ‘who wants to have sex anyway?’ and just like nun.” 
The film serves as a “diary entry” for Lu, with protagonist Emmy speaking what Lu has long yearned to say. Growing up Christian, Lu feels all too familiar with the sometimes problematic messaging spread by the church on purity. Still involved with Christianity, the script is complicated for Lu.  
“Even though it was funny to write out, it was hard for me to critique my friends and people I know for what they said and what they’ve done … because I didn’t want to offend them. I didn’t want to get them in trouble,” they said. “I see it now as like, ‘this is exactly what you said, and kind of exactly what you did.’ I’m just holding up the mirror to you, and I’m just showing you your reflection, and if you don’t like it, then you don’t like it, and maybe that says something.” 
Still, Lu is apprehensive about her friends’ thoughts on the project. She is stuck in the dilemma of wanting to share her work and “hoping they actually don’t know this is about them somehow.” Their fear is largely overshadowed by her desire to create the representation she so needed only a few years ago. 
The seeds of the film were planted a year ago after producer Amanda Chen created Yu Productions, a company focused on sharing stories from women, people of color and the LGBTQIA+ community. Chen is not a part of the ace community, but “Welcome to Celibacy Club” served as a learning experience for her, especially considering the writers and director are on the ace spectrum. 
“I think it’ll definitely make the world a safer place for asexual people, and queer people in general,” said Chen, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies. “I’m not expecting our film to make it big or anything like that, but it is a little push forward, I would hope.” 
The film has received resounding support from the ace community, especially on TikTok. Lu employed her knowledge of TikTok to reach the ace community — specifically tagging each video with #AceTok. Quickly, the film’s content blew up as the ace community began to “flock” to their page, expressing their excitement and gratefulness to finally see themselves represented. 
“That’s the biggest thing that kept me going. When it would get a little hard or I would doubt myself, or I’m like, ‘Is this even gonna be good? Or worth it?,’” said director Campbell Moore, a senior majoring in communication. “Just looking at all the people who are excited to see that representation, it just reminded me, ‘oh, yeah, that’s why I’m doing this.’”
The TikTok account, which has garnered over 8.6 thousand followers and almost 200 thousand likes, remains flooded with supportive messages. The commenters often echo the same sentiment of impatience for the film’s release, woeful resentment about the ace community’s lack of representation and, of course, quite a few references to “Bunk’d.”
The short is currently towards the end of post-production, and the crew are working on submitting the project to film festivals. While there is no exact timeline for the film’s release, the team sees “Welcome to Celibacy Club” as a start to a new era of representation.   
“I hope future people will be also inspired to make their own things. The biggest thing with representation is being able to see yourself on the screen and know that it’s possible,” Moore, who is on the ace spectrum, said. “I just hope for other asexual people to see that it is possible, and that people are trying to make it happen.”

In their final, and perhaps toughest, challenge before conference play begins on Feb. 15, the No. 10 USC men’s volleyball team travels to Happy Valley this week for the Pac-12/Big Ten Challenge. It features two tough matchups for the Trojans against No. 4 Penn State and No. 13 Ohio State at Rec Hall in State College, Pennsylvania. USC will play the Nittany Lions on Friday and the Buckeyes on Saturday. 
The Trojans are looking to build a winning streak following back-to-back wins against No. 12 UC Santa Barbara and CSU Northridge. Ohio State is also on a win streak, having won five straight matches. On the other hand, Penn State is looking to rebound after suffering their first loss against Long Beach State in their most recent match. The Trojans are 3-6 against the Nittany Lions at Rec Hall all-time (20-11 overall), and they haven’t beaten Penn State on their own floor since 2000. To turn the tide, the Trojans will aim to control what they can. 
“What we do in the practice gym translates to what happens on the floor,” said Head Coach Jeff Nygaard in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We need to know and believe that our normal, our average, can compete at a high level, and then we go in there and build upon that.”
USC has a better record of 19-6 all-time against Ohio State, but lost their last meeting against the Buckeyes 3-1 in the very same tournament last season. With these being the final two games before a week off, and then the beginning of conference play, Coach Nygaard emphasized the importance of the lessons this weekend will teach. 
“It’s a ramp up to see where we are,” Nygaard said. “We have next week off … that was built in there purposely for us to go ‘OK, we have to reset, we have to go over these things.’” 
One player that will likely be key for the Trojans to pull off big wins all weekend is graduate transfer Kevin Kobrine. Kobrine, an opposite hitter who transferred from UCLA, has had plenty of success against Penn State in his career. 
“I’ve actually never lost to Penn State,” Kobrine said. “I’m 3-0.”
Kobrine learned from his personal success against Penn State that the key to stopping the Nittany Lions is keeping their hitters at bay. 
“If we just play our game, focusing strategically on some of their better players like their outside Brett Wildman and their middle Toby [Ezeonu], we can figure out how to stop them or slow them down, and I think it’s a very winnable game,” Kobrine said. 
Kobrine asserted that the biggest key to a successful weekend overall will be consistency.
“A lot of players that are up and down, especially players that don’t have as much experience,” Kobrine said. “They’ll have some really high games and really high points, and then some really low points. For a good team and for a good player, it’s very important for consistency.” 
Experience is just one part of Kobrine’s all-around skill set that Nygaard thinks will be extremely valuable to his team’s success in the tournament. 
“He can just rip from the service line, which he’s got a really deadly serve. He can take over attacking, he can be a shutdown blocker, and I wrap all that in experience,” Nygaard said. 
While Kobrine has been a big addition to Nygaard’s team, Kobrine also feels that he has gained a lot as a player after transferring from UCLA. 
“Here [at USC], I have a very fresh perspective of, each game is important, each game has its own value,” Kobrine said. 
USC will aim to take down two ranked opponents this weekend and see the trip as an opportunity to be an ambassador of the Trojan way. 
“We’re wearing the USC brand, and everywhere we go people look to that brand and they understand that it represents excellence,” Nygaard said. “Therefore, it’s upon us, with no private moments out there anymore, to represent that brand at the highest level … at all times we gotta make sure that we’re handling ourselves in a way that’s commiserate to the brand of USC.”
Of course, the best thing for the Trojan brand would be going 2-0 in Pennsylvania.
“If we just go in and just bring our brand of volleyball, we should have the outcome we want,” Nygaard said. 
The Trojans will take on the Nittany Lions on Friday at 4 p.m. and then will battle the Buckeyes on Saturday at 1 p.m. Both games can be seen on the B1G+ network.

The Pac-12 always seems to beat each other up when it comes to basketball. In the past three NCAA tournaments, the Pac-12 has sent three teams, five teams and three teams, in comparison to the SEC who have sent six teams, six teams then seven teams. The ACC has averaged a little over six teams for the field of 68 in the same time period.
As of now, there are six schools that are either on the bubble or will make the NCAA tournament as long as things don’t go drastically wrong: Arizona, Arizona State, Oregon, UCLA, USC and Utah. Here’s an in-depth look at where the March Madness hopefuls stand ahead of the tournament:
Arizona
The Arizona Wildcats are 19-3 on the season, climbing all the way up to No. 5 in the latest AP poll rankings. The Wildcats are essentially a lock to play in March, but they still want to submit their best resume in hopes of getting a No. 1 seed in the tournament. According to ESPN’s Joe Lunardi, they are currently projected to be a No. 2 seed. 
Arizona has some impressive quadrant 1 wins against No. 22 San Diego State , Creighton (ranked No. 10 at the time), No. 2 Tennessee, No. 21 Indiana, Arizona State, UCLA (ranked No. 5 at the time) and Washington State. 
The Wildcats will be leaning on their “‘twin towers’,” 6-foot-11 junior forward Azuolas Tubelis and 7-foot junior center Oumar Ballo, to make a deep run in the tournament. Tubelis is leading the team in points and rebounds, averaging 20.0 and 9.6 respectively. Ballo is a monster on the defensive end, averaging 9.1 rebounds per game and 1.6 blocks per game. 
Arizona State 
The 15-7 Sun Devils are led by fifth-year senior guard and Nevada transfer Desmond Cambridge Jr. and his brother, senior guard and Auburn transfer Devan Cambridge. Together, the Cambridges account for a combined 23.6 points per game, 8.8 rebounds per game, and 2.1 steals per game.
After losing four straight games to Pac-12 opponents, the Sun Devils need to get back to their winning ways in order to keep their NCAA tournament hopes alive. As of now, they are projected to be one of the next four teams out of the NCAA tournament according to Lunardi’s Bracketology. 
In order for the Sun Devils to stay in consideration, they most likely need to win at least one of their games against rival No. 5 Arizona, No. 9 UCLA or USC.
Oregon
The Oregon Ducks have had an up-and-down season, and currently sport a 13-9 record. Although the Ducks have some impressive wins, including an 87-68 victory over then-ranked No. 9 Arizona and a 68-56 win over Utah, they also have some pretty poor losses that deeply hurt their resume, like their 56-69 loss to UC Irvine and 64-71 loss to a 9-12 Stanford team.
Picked in the preseason to finish third overall in the Pac-12, the Ducks have not lived up to expectations. They are 7-4 in the Pac-12, good for fifth place in the conference. 
In order for Oregon to be in consideration for the NCAA tournament, either of two scenarios has to happen. The first is for them to run the table and have at least three statement wins against Arizona, UCLA, the first-place team in the Pac-12 and USC. The other scenario is for them to qualify for an automatic bid by winning the Pac-12 tournament at the end of the season. This is a tall task for leading scorer senior guard Will Richardson and the Ducks.
UCLA
UCLA received 26 first-place votes for the preseason Pac-12 poll, and they are surely living up to the hype. The Bruins are 17-4 on the season and ranked No. 9 in the nation. 
They are led by a trio of guards, senior Jaime Jaquez Jr., senior Tyger Campbell and junior Jaylen Clark. They are all averaging over 13 points per game with Jaquez Jr. leading the team with 16 points per game. 
According to Lunardi’s recent projected bracket, the Bruins are lined up to be a No. 2 national seed, setting them up for another Final Four run. The Bruins are looking to become the first team in the Western United States to win the NCAA tournament since Arizona in 1997.
USC
The Trojans have had a couple of huge wins in the past couple of weeks, putting the country on watch and themselves in the March Madness conversation. The Trojans beat their cross-town rival Bruins 77-64 behind a career-high 31 points from senior guard Boogie Ellis. 
USC also beat fellow fringe team Arizona State 77-69 in the past week, leading them to a projected 9 seed according to Lunardi.
The Trojans are an outstanding 10-1 at home, with their lone loss coming in the first game of the season against Florida Gulf Coast. 
The Trojans have put together a strong resume in order to get to March. They will get into the tournament as long as they don’t slip up against sub-.500 teams like Oregon State, Cal, Stanford or Washington State. One key player for the rest of the year for the Trojans is freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu. Iwuchukwu missed the entire first half of the season due to suffering cardiac arrest in July, but has been an effective piece off the bench over the past couple of games for Head Coach Andy Enfield. 
Utah
Utah is the one sneaky Pac-12 team on the bubble that could cause some madness in March. The Utes have one huge quality win against conference foe Arizona, 81-66, who was ranked No. 4 in the nation at the time. 
In order for Utah to even have a chance, their 7-foot senior center Branden Carlson needs to step up as he has all season long. Carlson is leading the team in points, rebounds, and blocks, averaging 16.6, 7.5 and 2.2, respectively. 
Utah has matchups against both Los Angeles schools, both Arizona schools and Colorado, so wins against at least 3 of these strong teams could put a stamp on their ticket to the NCAA tournament. 
The Pac-12 tournament starts on March 8 in Las Vegas, with the winner of the tournament getting an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Selection Sunday is on March 12 with the NCAA tournament lasting from March 14 to April 3. Only time will tell how many of these dominant teams will get a chance at the Big Dance.
