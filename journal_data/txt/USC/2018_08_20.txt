Co-founded by friends Karey Burke, Dawn Olmstead and Jenn Worley, Face Haus was created based upon the co-owners’ realization that facials are generally expensive, especially for students. The boutique facial bar aims to bring the fun, affordable treatment to USC. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Forget frilly spas; Face Haus is here to make facials fast, affordable and fun. The self-proclaimed ‘Drybar of facials’ opened in USC Village on Aug. 22. Face Haus is a full-service facial bar co-founded by friends Karey Burke, Dawn Olmstead and Jenn Worley. 
Its primary offerings include signature facials with quirky names like Spotless Reputation, Keep Glowing and Best Man, as well as upgrade options such as Eye Rise and Lip, Laugh, Love. Full-service facials are provided by licensed aestheticians at a reasonable price point. 
The concept for Face Haus was inspired by the co-founders’ shared realization that facials, though popular beauty treatments, are generally unaffordable. When they treated their daughters to a spa day, they were shocked at the high cost of $150 per facial. Soon after, they set out to build a skin care company that provided “facials for the people,” as their tagline goes. 
“Whether it’s teens or men or busy women or young professionals or college students,” said Worley, who is also the chief creative officer. “Our mission is to provide skin care to as many people as possible.”
The members of the founding trio each bring diverse backgrounds to Face Haus. Both Burke and Olmstead work in entertainment, heading Freeform and Universal Cable Productions, respectively. Burke brought in the initial investors while Olmstead spearheaded design for the company. Worley, an entrepreneur and writer, is in charge of the day-to-day operations. The founders are all mothers (they have 14 children between the three of them) making Face Haus a truly “mom and mom and mom shop” as coined by Burke. 
The facial bar originated in Studio City and has additional stores in West Hollywood and Santa Monica. Another location is set to open in South Bay this fall. The company hopes to grow even more in the coming months. 
“Our mission is ‘for the people’ and that means not just being in New York and LA,” Burke said. “It means being across the country and hopefully international.” 
The USC location is the largest so far, with the space being built to host parties and events. The founders are working with Student Affairs to partner with and host events for different mixes of groups on campus. A soft opening this past week invited song girls, resident advisors, and other groups of students for complimentary eye and lip treatments. Nick Viall from “The Bachelor” also made an appearance, opting for the Best Man signature facial. 
The menu is broken down by skin concern and type of client, but Worley explains, “that type of consultation really happens in the chair.” For brand new clients, she suggests a House Special with an add on such as Power to the Pores or Universal A-peel. Signature facials are set at $65, and range from 30 to 45 minutes to complete. The company’s consulting dermatologist, Harold Lancer, designed United We Smooth, which pairs his products with microdermabrasion, a procedure that gently sands away the outer layer of skin, for $95. Additionally, an affordable, student-friendly package series is set to launch this September. 
“The goal is obviously to be in as many cities and to be as accessible to people as we can be,” Burke said. With new product development and nationwide openings are set for later this year, the founders are hopeful for the future of Face Haus, the only skin care company providing, according to Worley, “open concept, express, high efficacy, but no-fluff facials for all types of skin, not just aging women,” with Burke chiming in “with lots of money!”

In “Minding the Gap,” director and producer Bing Liu tells the story of three friends’ struggles with intergenerational trauma, domestic abuse and toxic masculinity through the lens of skateboarding culture. (Photo from Hulu)
From the battered streets of Rockford, Ill. and the mind of one of its natives — director, producer and cinematographer Bing Liu — comes “Minding the Gap,” a profound documentary feature exploring skateboarding culture, toxic masculinity and so much more. The character-driven verite film follows four years in the lives of 16-year-old Keire, 23-year-old Zack and Liu as the band of outcasts finds solace from their broken home lives in the streets and in each other.
What starts as a seemingly jaunty and boyish film, featuring montages of the friends’ skateboarding antics and teenage squabbles, soon takes an unexpected direction as its protagonists approach the precipice of manhood. 
For Keire, this means grappling with thedeath of his abusive father and growing into his African American identity amid a circle of white childhood friends. Zack’s transitional moment comes when his girlfriend Nina gets pregnant and he is forced to find a way to provide for his family with limited education, few resources and no role models to speak of. And Liu, who previously only existed behind the camera, begins to weave himself into the subjects and themes of the film, drawing from his similarly toxic background and undergoing his own healing process. Forming an interracial brotherhood of misfits, the three young men gradually confront their pasts in their own ways.
In the beginning, skateboarding is described by one friend as “more of a family than my family” — more precisely defined by the maxim Keire has on his board: “This device cures heartbreak.” But eventually, as adulthood begins to tighten its grip on their lives, it becomes clear that skateboarding and the reprise from reality it offers cannot protect them forever. Their efforts to escape their problems by horsing around in skate parks seamlessly develop into a tale of intergenerational trauma, domestic violence and the pitfalls of masculinity. 
Released on Aug. 17 on Hulu, Bing Liu’s character-driven vérité film “Minding the Gap” portrays skateboarding as an intimate escape from the traumas and stresses of everyday life in a suburban setting. (Photo from Hulu)
The cyclicality of these themes touches the story in various ways — from Liu tearfully confronting his own mother about his abusive stepfather to the revelation that Zack has become violent toward Nina in the throes of his alcoholism. As the years pass and the characters age, Keire becomes increasingly desperate to liberate himself from the decrepit small town while Zack begins to consider how his life decisions are affecting his son. By the end, both are virtually unrecognizable from the goofy kids audiences are introduced to, yet their passions for skateboarding persist throughout and continue to be central to their identities. 
As for Liu, he achieves a newfound sense of clarity about his own childhood and learns to process the past through autobiographical storytelling. It is refreshingly organic to not only hear Liu the filmmaker look into the other characters’ lives as a concerned friend but also to see him become an active and vulnerable participant in the story. Liu’s central involvement in the narrative is raw and honest, a nuance that would not be possible if he were merely an observer. 
“Minding the Gap” is a stunning portrait of stale suburbia, late-adolescent boys becoming men and the sprawling consequences of domestic violence. It flings open a doorway into abuse and the male psyche while telling an optimistic tale of young people surviving their situations and going on to forge meaningful lives for themselves. Though framed by skateboarding, the film achieves a mature poignancy through its deeply intimate tone and its audacity to explore both the anguish and exhilaration of growing up.

Soccer and King Sisyphus have a lot more in common than you think.
Much like the mythological Greek king who was forced to roll a heavy boulder up a mountain over and over for eternity, soccer faces a similar uphill battle in becoming the new predominant pastime in the United States and at USC. 
In the past 30 years, it seems that every time non-American football starts to dribble the rock up the mountain, sports traditionalists push it right back down. Fortunately, for well-rounded sports fans, the world’s most popular game is slowly but surely making its way into the hearts of millions.
Major League Soccer franchises in Atlanta, Minnesota and Seattle have been setting their respective cities on fire with record-breaking attendance. This year’s World Cup — a faux Olympics for footy head’s alike — reignited America’s passion for the great game as powerhouse teams like France and underdog teams like Croatia roared their way past some of the world’s best. I believe that those similar World Cup sentiments should translate from the fields of Moscow to the fields of McAlister.
As one of six schools in the Pac-12 without a men’s soccer team, the USC women’s team is constantly overlooked despite its rampant success, including winning the 2016 NCAA Championship. Much like they sleep on mass-produced dorm mattresses in Pardee Tower, USC students are sleeping on this talented group of gals.
Although the women’s soccer program was founded years after prestigious programs like UCLA, Stanford and UC Berkeley, USC ranks fourth in the Pac-12 and is tied for 23rd in the nation with 16 NCAA Tournament appearances. Of those, four of them have come in the past four years under the tutelage of head coach Keidane McAlpine. 
Going to the NCAA playoffs that many times in a row is impressive enough, but to win a second national title in a sport that many USC students don’t pay attention to? That is flat out awesome, and somehow discouraging at the same time.
There is a theory known as the little fish, big pond theory: In a big pond, big numbers of little fish will have the opportunity to grow because of the sheer size of the pond. 
The Women of Troy are little fish in the huge pond that is NCAA Division I soccer. Despite other programs recruiting talent from all over the country and scoring crowds of thousands — not hundreds — of people to each of their games, the USC women’s soccer team is excelling and few people on campus know about it. 
Everybody and their mother remembers each of USC’s football titles, yet very few know about USC’s most recent soccer ring. 
Perhaps it’s soccer’s lack of popularity in the United States. Perhaps it’s USC Athletics’ poor marketing campaigns. Perhaps it’s the unfortunate but prevailing notion that sports like soccer -— or even USC’s highly-successful water polo — just aren’t that exciting. Perhaps it’s the noncoverage from mainstream media and student media’s inability to cover each and every game. 
Or perhaps it’s just a continuing campus-wide apathy for any sport that doesn’t include tailgating hours beforehand that is preventing USC’s non-revenue sports from achieving community-wide acclaim. 
Despite the lack of fan interaction, the squad has many returning stars to fill the gaps left by the seniors who graduated last year.
Although the Women of Troy lost top scorer forward Alex Anthony (8 goals, two assists) and over 50 percent of their offensive production from the 2017 season, they bring back flashy forward senior Leah Pruitt (6 goals, four assists), sneaky sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo (4 goals, five assists) and one of the best-kept secrets in sophomore goalkeeper Kaylie Collins (0.87 goals against average). 
And along with a plethora of first-year talent, the Women of Troy welcome in solid transfers graduate student midfielder Megan McCashland (Notre Dame), graduate student defender Jessie Holmes (Florida), redshirt junior forward/defender Natalie Jacobs (Notre Dame) and sophomore midfielder Alea Hyatt (North Carolina) from top-flight programs. 
Regardless of USC’s ability to get goals on the board, its defense will surely lead them into the NCAA playoffs for the fifth-straight season. If Collins can replicate her outstanding 2017 season, the Trojans will be in a fantastic position to ensure they have a shot at glory come December. If the new faces can rise to the challenge of their new starting roles, I believe that this 2018 squad has as good a chance as any to win yet another national title. 
With a 1-0 victory last week over UC Irvine, the Women of Troy are already on their way toward the program’s first undefeated season in history. That may sound far-fetched, but their schedule features a multitude of should-be wins that will give them the resume they need for a solid run in the playoffs. 
While games on the road against Florida, Florida State, Cal and Stanford are likely to be tough, home field advantage against Pac-12 foes UCLA, Arizona, Arizona State and Washington State will give USC the edge it needs to finally get people to care about USC’s more successful “football” team.

Former USC quarterback Sam Darnold steps back in the pocket to throw a pass at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
USC continued its annual tradition of sending multiple players to the NFL, with four Trojans selected in the 2018 Draft and others signed to teams as undrafted free agents. With this year’s four draft picks, the Trojans have had 504 players drafted into the league, the most of any school in the country. Here’s a look at this year’s Trojan draft class and the undrafted free agents with a chance to make an impact on NFL rosters this season.
QB Sam Darnold
Round 1, Pick 3 Overall 
New York Jets
The Rose Bowl winning signal caller will begin his NFL career in the Big Apple, looking to turn around a Jets team that went a 10-22 over the last two years. Though he was picked to be their quarterback of the future, he’ll have to fight for the opportunity to start Week 1 of the season, as he’ll compete with veteran quarterbacks Josh McCown and Teddy Bridgewater for that chance. Darnold has performed fairly well so far through two preseason games, going 21-of-29 passing for 158 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Although Bridgewater and McCown have played well to this point, reports suggest that the team might be leaning toward letting the former Trojan start under center Week 1.
RB Ronald Jones II
Round 2, Pick 38 Overall
Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
Jones was the fourth running back selected in this years draft, going to a Bucs team desperately in need of playmaking from the tailback position. So far, Jones has ceded the starting role to Payton Barber, but has shared some of the first team work with him. Jones has struggled thus far in the offseason, with reports of trouble in pass protection and ball security, as well as subpar performances in the two preseason games to date. Jones is still a uniquely talented player, and the Buccaneers use of a second round pick on him shows the faith they have in him to be a dynamic part of their offense. If he can flip the switch soon, he has the opportunity to have a big year down in Tampa.
OLB Uchenna Nwosu 
Round 2, Pick 48 Overall 
Los Angeles Chargers
The edge rusher had a huge season for the Trojans last year, serving as a terror to opposing quarterbacks with 9.5 sacks and 14 pass breakups. His production earned him a high draft spot from the Chargers, with whom he’ll be able to play in his home city of Carson, Calif. The Chargers add Nwosu to a front seven already featuring Pro-Bowlers Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa, a fact that should open up plenty of opportunities for the ex-Trojan as a pass-rusher. He’s impressed so far through the offseason, drawing rave reviews from coaches and teammates, and has done well in the preseason, securing a sack in his first game and adding a number of quarterback pressures in both his performances.
DE Rasheem Green
Round 3, Pick 79 Overall 
Seattle Seahawks
Somewhat an enigma of a prospect, projected everywhere from the first to the fourth round during the pre-draft process, Rasheem Green has probably gotten off to the hottest start of all the Trojans entering the league this year. Through two preseason contests, Green has racked up an  impressive three sacks, 13 tackles and seven quarterback hits. The Seahawks are in desperate need of players to step up on the defensive line after the departures of Pro-Bowlers Michael Bennett, Sheldon Richardson and Cliff Avril this year. If Green continues to maintain his stellar level of play through the season, he’ll make a huge difference for a reloading Seahawks defense.
WR Deontay Burnett
Undrafted Free Agent 
Tennessee Titans
One of the bigger surprises of this year’s draft for the Trojans was Burnett going undrafted after a year, where he led the Trojans in receiving, posting an impressive statline of 1,114 yards and 9 touchdowns. He seems to have been a steal so far for the Titans, who lack strong options at the wide receiver position. Burnett has performed remarkably well so far for the Titans in training camp, developing a strong chemistry with quarterback Marcus Mariota as well as showcasing great route running and hands. He’s been nagged by some injuries in the preseason so far, but managed to make some nice plays in the last game. Look for him to potentially become an important part of Tennessee’s passing attack.
WR Steven Mitchell
Undrafted Free Agent 
Los Angeles Rams
Mitchell went undrafted after another unspectacular but solid season at USC, finding an opportunity to play in the Coliseum once more as an undrafted free agent for the Rams. He’s impressed his coaches so far, and has made some nice plays throughout training camp and the preseason. On a team lacking any real wide receiver depth, Mitchell has a chance to make the roster or practice squad this year. He’ll be fighting to get a spot on the team’s final 53-man roster over the next few weeks.

Freshman Kevin Porter Jr. will bring his athletic talents to the men’s basketball squad in their upcoming season. (Photo courtesy of USC Athletics)
The 2018-19 USC men’s basketball team has a lot of production to distribute. With the departures of starters Chimezie Metu, Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart, there are plenty of holes to fill on the roster.
However, all is not lost. USC has improved its basketball recruiting in recent years, and its advances can be seen in this year’s crop of 2018 freshmen. Here’s what you need to know about the incoming recruits.
Kevin Porter Jr.
Shooting Guard
Small Forward
The highest-ranked freshman in USC’s class, Kevin Porter Jr. earned a five-star ranking and was named the 28th-best player in the country by 247Sports. The Seattle native averaged 28 points, 14 rebounds and six assists in his senior year, leading Rainier Beach High School to the 3A Washington state championship game.
At 6-foot-5 and 200 pounds, Porter is an explosive athlete. He’s fast, he’s quick and he can get up off the floor. This natural talent has made for a fair number of highlight dunks, and USC fans should get used to seeing Porter throw down this season.
Porter also has the potential to be the go-to scorer the Trojans sorely missed last season. The lefty showed the ability to score at all three levels in high school, with the ability to finish at the rim with either hand and a nice shooting stroke off the dribble. Porter is also a crafty ball-handler, with a powerful ability to get to his spot against any defender.
The biggest questions facing Porter have to do with his passing ability and consistent intensity. If head coach Andy Enfield can get Porter to move the ball and go all out on every possession, the Trojans could have a star on their hands early this season.
Elijah Weaver
Guard
Weaver, a combo guard from Rockledge, Fla., is the 37th-ranked player in the nation according to ESPN, three spots higher than Porter. A four-star recruit, Weaver averaged 23.1 points, 8.2 rebounds and 8.7 assists in his final high school season. He was honored as Florida’s Class 6A Player of the Year. 
Although he possesses the same strong, 6-foot-5 frame as Porter, Weaver fits the model of a pure point guard more than his new teammate. Also a lefty, he’s a talented passer, using his height to see over the defense and passing lanes. He’s also very adept at driving the lane and finding the open man. These could be a crucial skills in the absence of graduated point guard Jordan McLaughlin, who ranked fourth in the country in assists last season and ran the offense.
Weaver also uses his frame to his advantage on defense. His long arms and smooth athleticism make his abilities hard to limit, and were certainly part of the reason he averaged 4.3 steals per game in his senior season.
To unlock his full potential, Weaver will need to improve his jumper. It’s not that the shot is broken, but adding a deadly shot to his arsenal will make Weaver virtually unstoppable.
J’Raan Brooks
Power Forward
The final of USC’s three four-star or better recruits, Brooks was a star at Garfield High School in Seattle, the school that defeated Porter’s in the 3A state title game. Brooks decommitted from USC following the FBI probe involving former player De’Anthony Melton and former assistant coach Tony Bland, but recommitted after Melton declared for this summer’s NBA Draft.
Brooks, ranked 83rd nationally by 247Sports, was a key cog on a Garfield team that finished the season as the 11th-best team in the country. At 6-foot-9 and 220 pounds, Brooks made his mark on both ends of the floor. He’s noted as a tenacious rebounder and rim protector with a high motor. He is also a skilled offensive player, with a capable mid-range jumpshot and good footwork and touch around the basket.
Brooks lacks an elite skill. He’s not an amazing athlete or a one-on-one scorer. He’s solid in every area of the game, but he might not be a difference-maker. The best way for him to improve would be extending his range to the 3-point line, as it would help the Trojans’ spacing immensely.
Brooks’ return, along with Porter, gives the Trojans the two best players in the class from Washington. Unlike Porter and Weaver, though, Brooks has a clear shot to start; unlike the backcourt, the Trojans lack depth in the frontcourt, especially after losing Metu.
The most important thing to know about these three is that they can all be culture setters. All three are competitive and work hard, important qualities for freshmen. They may show it in different ways — Porter is fiery and emotional, Weaver is cool as a cucumber, and Brooks puts his emotion into cleaning the glass — but all want to win badly. If they can channel that in the correct way, the Trojans can continue to compete in the Pac-12.
