On Oct. 23, a series of terror attacks were launched, culminating in the Nov. 18 attack on a synagogue in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof. What the attack in Har Nof taught us is that temporary solutions only guarantee peace until citizens lose patience with a static situation. The answer to long-term peace lies in a compromise between the leadership of the two states.
The Nov. 18 attack should be a pressing reminder for both Netanyahu and Abbas that a resolution is more urgent than ever. The series of events was horrific. It was particularly brutal as worshippers were attacked in the early hours of prayer. Four worshippers, the two attackers and a Druze policeman died at the scene. One of the victims, Kalman Levine, was a USC alumnus. Israel retaliated by destroying the homes belonging to the families of the two attackers. Twelve days later, right-winged Jewish extremists burned down an Arab-Jewish bilingual school in Jerusalem. Slogans reading, “There’s no coexisting with cancer” and “End assimilation” were sprayed on the walls of the school.
Both states reluctantly agreed to peace and both claimed victory in the conflict, which demonstrates the extreme division between Palestinian and Israeli leadership. It was naïve to believe that August’s ceasefire would resolve such longstanding conflict –– after all, it did not address the deeper issues at its heart. Though it solved the immediate issue, the relentless rocket fire that resulted in the deaths of nearly 2,200 Palestinians and 70 Israelis this past summer was not easily forgotten. The philosophy of vindication that both governments utilize makes lasting peace difficult to achieve. Both Israel and Hamas continue to justify retaliation and, as a result, civilians lose their lives. There is no easy solution for a conflict that is as old as the Bible. And yet, if Abbas and Netanyahu were to cease attacking each other’s credibility, they could cooperate on a solution that would prevent further casualties.
Cooperation is no easy task for fundamentally opposing individuals, let alone for a whole population. On the other hand, however, not doing so results in tension accumulating to the point we witnessed this last month. Abbas publically condemned the attack on the Har Nof synagogue in a seemingly positive step towards cooperation, but he should have condemned every attack beginning with the first on Oct. 23. This development came after he sent a letter of condolence to the family of Moataz Hejazi, the man who shot activist Yehuda Glick, and after the Palestinian Authority’s official media outlet claimed Jewish settlers murdered Palestinian bus driver Yussuf al-Ramuni and framed it as a suicide.
His contradictory actions establish a façade for the international community. While he denounces violence Palestinians perpetuate, he’s also simultaneously condemning Israel as being the root of the conflict. Abbas’ words are meaningless if he doesn’t make an effort to be proactive in controlling Hamas, which won’t be satisfied until Israel is no longer in existence, it is Abbas’ job to delegitimize Hamas in the eyes of his citizens and push the majority towards a cooperative two-state solution. He must act as a rational leader and take control of Palestine to work toward a positive future.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu is not been without blame in the escalating tension over recent weeks. He vehemently blames Abbas directly for the attacks and refuses to differentiate Hamas from the Palestinian Authority and continues to approve new settlements. By treating Abbas and the PA as an extension of Hamas he is recklessly conflating two very different representations of Palestine, which discourages Israeli citizens from accepting cooperative efforts. His strategy is detrimental to the long-term peace efforts that the many Israelis and Palestinians both want. His method of blaming the government and fear mongering is detrimental to the respect necessary for cooperation between the two leaders.
If Netanyahu and Abbas continue to hold each other personally responsible for recent violence, peace will only move farther out of reach. Both leaders must work in good faith to make the most immediate goals of the Palestinian people possible. At the same time, Abbas must stop inciting provocative rhetoric and convince Hamas that cooperation with Israel is in the best interest of Palestinian citizens.
The pattern of violence shows increasing brutality that will only continue until comprehensive solutions are reached. This will require nothing short of genuine efforts on the parts of both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.  Without authentic mutual respect between the leadership of both sides, their citizens will not take cooperation seriously.
Modern Muslims have religious conflict with: Hindus in Kashmir;
Christians in Nigeria, Egypt, and Bosnia; atheists in Chechnya; Baha’is in
Iran; Animists in Darfur; Buddhists in Thailand; each other in Iraq, Pakistan,
Somalia, and Yemen; Jews in Israel; Why is Islam involved in more sectarian and
religious conflicts than any other religion today? In fact, why is Islam the
only religion in conflict with every single one of today’s major world
religions?
But you think belligerent pugnacious Islam has legitimate grievances in this
constant conflict, and that, for example in Palestine, Islam is just defending
its own reasonable interests? 
No, not at bottom. At bottom what we have in Islam is a violent,
expansionist totalitarianism. That’s why Islam is in conflict all over the
world with every other religion.

It seems as though I’m back at the keyboard too soon. It seems as though history can repeat itself within the course of a few weeks.
Speaking of history, it’s time for a lesson.
I’m told to “trust the system.” Apparently, it’s supposed to stand for truth, justice and the American way (or some crap like that). My own friends claim that, despite its flaws and slipups, the system is meant to ensure “equality” and “fairness” (or some crap like that).
Turn back the clock…
Twenty years ago. A man named Rodney King has been beaten nearly to death by men who are meant to be “keepers of the peace.” His assailants are not charged. The streets around our own campus burn.
Turn back the clock…
Fifty years ago. The country looks on as peaceful black protesters have fire hoses turned on them and dogs set upon them. Batons rain down, churches are bombed, little girls are killed. This is the plight of Birmingham. The greatest and most peaceful of all protesters has a dream, and he’s killed for it –– all of this as a result of the system.
Turn back the clock. The Little Rock Nine are spat upon.
Turn back the clock. Black men hang from trees amid burning crosses.
Turn back the clock. Black lives are worth exactly three-fifths of white lives.
Turn back the clock. Black women are raped and bred to watch their daughters suffer the same.
Turn back the clock. America the beautiful is built on the backs of slaves.
From where should I draw my trust? What point in the history of these United States can anyone claim, “Back then, the system was trustworthy.”
Eric Garner was my father. He was my brother. He was my son and my cousin and my husband –– simply because he looked like me. Now he’s in his grave with no justice to honor his memory.
In the wake of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, I have been divided from my peers. When racial tensions rise, suddenly I am black to them. They say I shouldn’t be so sensitive, that my people should stop acting like animals when the whole history of America is one great violent beast. They say these incidents have nothing to do with race. They say this nation has moved beyond its racism and prejudice and hatred –– and that I should too.
They say, like blind men, that I should trust the system.
To which I reply: “I can’t breathe.”

Sources in the mainstream media expressed outrage after a grand jury declined to indict a New York City policeman in the death of Eric Garner, but there are 11
significant facts that many of them have chosen to overlook:
1. There is no doubt that Garner was resisting an arrest for illegally selling
untaxed cigarettes. Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik put
it succinctly: “You cannot resist arrest. If Eric Garner did not resist arrest,
the outcome of this case would have been very different,” he told Newsmax. “He
wouldn’t be dead today.
“Regardless of what the arest was for, the officers don’t have the ability to say, ‘Well,
this is a minor arrest, so we’re just going to ignore you.’”
2. The video of the July 17 incident clearly shows Garner, an African-American,
swatting away the arms of a white officer seeking to take him into custody,
telling him: “Don’t touch me!”
3. Garner, 43, had history of more than 30 arrests dating back to 1980, on charges
including assault and grand larceny.
4. At the time of his death, Garner was out on bail after being charged with
illegally selling cigarettes, driving without a license, marijuana possession
and false impersonation.
5. The chokehold that Patrolman Daniel Pantaleo put on Garner was reported to have
contributed to his death. But Garner, who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds,
suffered from a number of health problems, including heart disease, severe
asthma, diabetes, obesity, and sleep apnea. Pantaleo’s attorney and police
union officials argued that Garner’s poor health was the main cause of his
death.
6. Garner did not die at the scene of the confrontation. He suffered cardiac
arrest in the ambulance taking him to the hospital and was pronounced dead
about an hour later.
7. Much has been made of the fact that the use of chokeholds by police is prohibited in
New York City. But officers reportedly still use them. Between 2009 and
mid-2014, the Civilian Complaint Review Board received 1,128 chokehold
allegations.
Patrick Lynch, president of the New York City Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said:
“It was clear that the officer’s intention was to do nothing more than take Mr.
Garner into custody as instructed, and that he used the takedown technique that
he learned in the academy when Mr. Garner refused.”
8. The grand jury began hearing the case on Sept. 29 and did not reach a decision
until Wednesday, so there is much testimony that was presented that has not
been made public.
9. The 23-member grand jury included nine non-white jurors.
10. In order to find Officer Pantaleo criminally negligent, the grand jury would have
had to determine that he knew there was a “substantial risk” that Garner would
have died due to the takedown.
11. Less than a month after Garner’s death, Ramsey Orta, who shot the much-viewed
videotape of the encounter, was indicted on weapons charges. Police alleged
that Orta had slipped a .25-caliber handgun into a teenage accomplice’s
waistband outside a New York hotel.
Chockhold had nothing to do about Garner’s race, had everything to do with his medical conditions and his past deeds to why he was confronted.
Powerful and very moving words.
