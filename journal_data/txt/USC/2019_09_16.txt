When the Iovine and Young Academy opened in 2013, all classes took place in “the Garage,” a collaborative work space on the fourth floor of the Tutor Campus Center. But now, IYA students have a place to officially call home.
The Iovine and Young Hall opened in August after two years of construction — and the space is more than just a collection of classrooms. IYA Assistant Dean for Academic Strategy Matthew Manos said he sees the new building as “a partner in allowing us to realize our curriculum.”
Iovine and Young Hall, or IYH, comprises three floors. The bottom floor is made up of workspaces, the second floor is home to undergraduate classrooms, meeting rooms and conference rooms and the third floor is dedicated to the graduate program’s classrooms. Also on the second floor is a door that opens up to a furnished balcony.
“We have a really beautiful patio space that faces the natural history museum,” Manos said. “Students can work outside, which is really great for creativity.”
While the building contains traditional classrooms, it also features room for students to work on projects and in groups. Students in IYA study Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, a unique major that combines multiple disciplines.
“We have, definitely, classrooms, but there’s a few different types of classrooms,” Manos said. “There’s ones that are more lecture-style, there’s ones that are more studio-style where you can kind of make a mess and it’s OK, and then we have a really large makerspace that has all kinds of really cool technology for fabricating or prototyping different ideas that people might have.”
Because IYA’s curriculum is hands-on, with an emphasis on collaboration, another key offering of the new building is its meeting rooms.
“We have different meeting spaces that the students can use, such as conference rooms and then what we call huddle rooms, which are sort of smaller meeting spaces,” Manos said.
Each room features a glass door that doubles as a dry erase board on which students sketch diagrams, scrawl out ideas and stick Post-It notes. 
IYA student Abigail Africa, a junior in the Academy, said the individual rooms, in contrast to the open space concept of the Garage, provide the opportunity to meet and work in groups more easily.
“Before, it was super disruptive if you wanted to have someone over while other groups were working,” Africa said. “Nobody was able to concentrate.”
Now, things are different.
“You can have visitors to a space without disturbing people who are working,” she said. “We have room to spread out. We have all these meeting rooms that you can book.”
Casey Reich, a sophomore in IYA, said the more spacious classrooms made the Academy feel more structured.
“It was a little hard to sometimes see everything and feel like you could create things in a space that was so cramped and had a lot of limited resources,” Reich said. “And also just having classrooms with little rolly desks, you have to fit like 30 people in a classroom that is only supposed to accommodate like 15 -— it gets a little hard to pay attention sometimes.”
With the new lecture halls, Reich said he finds it easier to stay organized and focused during class.
With the growth of IYA came the need for a building of its own, Manos said. IYA graduated its first cohort of students in 2018 and continues to admit 25 to 30 undergraduate students each year. The school also offers four minors, including product design, multimedia for designers and entrepreneurs, disruptive innovation and designing for experiences, as well as an online master’s program.
“We originally started just with one cohort of undergrads, and then as time went on, we’re now onto our sixth cohort,” Manos said. “It really grew, [and] we really needed a home for all of these people to be able to collaborate and make really amazing things together.”
With its 10,000 square feet of makerspaces, Iovine and Young Hall offers just that. The building also boasts student resources, including 3D printing and fabrication and media labs. And the academy’s resources extend beyond its students’ tenure there — among the first-floor makerspaces is the Alumni Lab, which Manos described as “a big modular room” with workstations that IYA alumni can apply to use for startups and projects. 
Reich said that recently, IYA students have been able to coordinate with the faculty to get equipment for the makerspaces that will allow them to complete projects with fewer hiccups.
“We’ve got a lot of materials that the students have requested,” Reich said. “We wanted a lathe, so [the dean] got a lathe … I’ve been able to get epoxy. And now we have really nice sewing machines and stuff — like, that is important, and we hadn’t had that before. So, that’s where I really see the big difference.”
But according to Africa, it’s not just the improved technology and meeting space that makes Iovine and Young Hall valuable to the school’s students. The building now gives students a place at the University to call their own.
“More than anything, it gives us a sense of belonging on campus,” Africa said.

In 2016, everyone’s favorite refrain suddenly became that they were definitely going to move to Canada. After election night, the Canadian Citizenship and Immigration website crashed from high traffic. With each new political scandal and a possible second term for President Donald Trump looming ominously, more and more self-declared progressives insist that they are really, truly going to move to Canada.
On the surface, it’s an understandable sentiment. After all, racial tensions in America have exploded to the forefront of the public consciousness, mass shootings fill our timelines faster than we can respond to them, and every day women and minority groups witness their rights being meticulously chipped away by an administration hell-bent on making America “great again.” Who wouldn’t want to move to some sort of Western utopia — like America, but better!
But what do we reveal about ourselves when this — packing up and moving to Canada — is our solution? Well, first of all, it reveals a degree of privilege and ignorance regarding our position in the world. Immigration is one of the most contentious issues in our country. Every day, we learn more about the heartbreaking and sometimes deadly family separations and detentions on the U.S.-Mexico border. The idea that someone could just pack up and move to another country on a whim while people die trying to immigrate to the United States reflects a profound state of cognitive dissonance.
But let’s say someone actually makes the big move to Canada or whatever promised land. What then? Have they arrived in a progressive utopia? Well, no. Certainly, Canada has more progressive policies in areas like healthcare, but there is no utopian country free of strife, conflict and historical baggage. Even now, as Canada shines like the perfect older sister up north with a Disney prince for a prime minister, it continues to have its own struggles, from forced sterilizations of Indigenous women to harmful environmental policies. Pretending otherwise displays ignorance, avoids accountability and erases the genuine struggles other citizens face.
It may seem harmless, but this grandstanding further promotes the destructive narrative that issues like racism are purely a Trump phenomenon. White supremacy is unfortunately as American as apple pie and baseball. People of color have been aware of the continued prominence of white supremacy in this country since long before Trump moved into the White House. Presupposing that the current racial tension will magically dissipate if someone else becomes president reveals the privileged perspective of someone who has primarily experienced a world without this racial tension that so many others have known long before Trump arrived.
So where does this leave us? If someone truly wants to leave the U.S., especially if they fear for their safety and their rights, they can. But be aware that immigration is a long, expensive, confusing and sometimes fruitless endeavor. On the other hand, people who have no real plans to move to Canada and only threaten it to express their frustration should perhaps rethink this particular refrain because it reflects a sense of privilege and ignorance and ultimately amounts to nothing. 
Here’s what to do instead: Acknowledge your privilege and confront the power embedded within the rhetoric we engage with every day. Encourage friends and family to be more thoughtful with their words because they truly shape the way we see the world. Encourage them to be active and engaged rather than shun our current problems for a utopia that never has and never will exist. And when all else fails? Vote! Vote in every election — local, state and federal. While there is no perfect oasis of free healthcare and multicultural cooperation out there, each of us has some power to make this country better for each other by voting and making our voices heard.

There is a beautiful quote by American journalist Ellen Goodman that deeply resonates with our mission at the Daily Trojan, particularly in these last few semesters: “In journalism, there has always been a tension between getting it first and getting it right.”
This is a tension that every newsroom struggles with to varying extents. Reporting accurately and fairly is at the forefront of what we at the Daily Trojan strive toward — but sometimes, it’s important to take a step back. 
Two weeks ago, two student deaths hit our campus. Following the death of junior Ben Duma Sept. 4, there was a divide in our newsroom over how to handle reporting this incident and if we should have reported on it at all.
Ultimately, the Daily Trojan followed its existing suicide reporting protocol — stating the facts and reporting accurately and diligently. Our policy was created just last year after meeting with senior leaders at the Engemann Student Health Center following a suicide in April 2018. While the protocols took steps to minimize harm, they overlooked the mental and emotional effects reporting on suicide can have on any community.
The death of a student the following day affirmed some of our previous thinking — that reporting these stories often causes more harm than good in a community that is grieving. We chose not to report on this death because we understand and have seen that spotlighting suicide in any way can create contagion and trigger community members who may be more vulnerable. 
Last year, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board called for the University to expand on suicide prevention efforts, but this time around, we must look introspectively to do better by remaining sensitive to our readers’ well-being. 
The Daily Trojan Editorial Board recognizes the flaws in our previous policy and have decided to reevaluate how our newspaper reports on suicide. 
In 2018, the American College Health Association found that  41.4% of students felt depressed and 11.3% of students seriously considered suicide. As a publication with students as our core audience, we must remain sensitive to our readers’ wellness.
In accordance with the Associated Press Stylebook’s guidelines, the Daily Trojan will report on suicides or suicide attempts if they involve a well-known person or the circumstances are “publicly disruptive.” We will also limit the number of times we post about these articles on social media while still making sure the community knows where to turn for counseling services,  events that will honor the victims’ lives and crucial information. 
And even though we will minimize reporting on suicides, we won’t let the loss of student lives go unnoticed in our paper. With consent and after an appropriate time period, the Daily Trojan will reach out to family and friends for obituaries, as we are committed to honoring each student’s life, rather than focusing on how they died.
We have taken the time as a newsroom to reflect not only on the story we published Sept. 4 but also on our past reporting. Our readers deserve transparency for why we make the decisions that we do. We understand that providing the public with as much accurate information as possible is a key pillar of journalism, but moving forward our newsroom will put the community’s well-being at the forefront of our news judgment. 
Our wellness initiative instituted this semester will include further, in-depth coverage of mental and emotional health initiatives to both inform the community of the resources available to them and hold our University accountable to further improve its wellness efforts.
Students dealing with mental health concerns can walk into USC Student Health centers or contact the 24/7 phone line (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance. Faculty and staff members can reach out to the Center for Work and Family Life at (213) 821-0800. Students, faculty and staff members concerned about a fellow Trojan can notify Trojans Care 4 Trojans online or by calling (213) 821-4710.

After USC’s Sustainability Office released its 2019 August progress report on its 2020 goals, which provided an update on the University’s environmental footprint, some student leaders remain concerned with the report’s inaccessibility and lack of transparency.
While the report, which was published on the USC Sustainability website, shows improvement in energy conservation, water reduction and increased awareness, efforts in waste diversion and community engagement have encountered roadblocks.
Created in 2015, the 2020 goals were designed as a roadmap to outline USC’s environmental responsibilities and set five-year goals for the community. To do so, USC organized its ambitions into seven pillars: Education and Research, Engagement, Energy Conservation and Greenhouse Gas Mitigation, Transportation, Procurement, Waste Diversion and Water Conservation.
According to the report, USC has yet to implement a sustainable shipping and packaging program and has not enrolled departments in a green purchasing commitment.
These challenges are partially due to the design of the goals and the targets outlined at the time, which have since shifted, according to Nathaniel Hyman, co-director of the Environmental Student Assembly.
“The report is sometimes difficult to read,” said Hyman, a junior studying public policy and law. “For example, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions say they’ve reached 50% of their 20% reduction goal and then the explanation to how they’ve done it was because they had completed one of two goals and neither of those goals had anything to do with actually reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”
Hyman, who focused on the transportation pillar in the past year, expressed frustration at the criteria for what qualifies a goal as completed, citing transportation’s 100% goal completion. 
“100% completed, on the goal of doing anything at all,” Hyman joked. “The goal for transportation was reduce single occupancy vehicles coming to campus every day [but] it doesn’t specify by how much.”
Hyman was also critical of the previous University administration’s lack of support toward sustainability. 
“[President C.L. Max] Nikias was not aggressive at all on fighting for sustainability,” Hyman said. “[Would] the office of sustainability be able to talk to for more than five minutes to the Board of Trustees about sustainability?”
Ellen Dux, associate director for the Office of Sustainability, cited staff turnover, overly ambitious targets and external factors as inhibitions towards overall progress in sustainable development at USC. 
Dux said the office has had minimal staff numbers and resources to provide elaborate reports on the current state of affairs and achieve long-term goals.
“People didn’t even start focusing on this until 2018,” Dux said. “Once a plan is there, you can’t be like, guess what, now you look at the plan and one whole vertical is missing. Be careful whatever structure you put in place; in that moment in time, it might be the best structure you come up with, but it will dog you forever.” 
Despite how difficult the report is to read and the lack of advancements in some aspects of sustainability,  Dux insisted that USC has made extraordinary strides in the last year alone, citing greenhouse gas reduction as an example. 
“Have we achieved 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions today? No, we’ve achieved 10%,” Dux said.  “However,  we’ve done some really nice jobs with tracking and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions.”
While the report boasts multiple achievements, Dux called  the 2020 goals “the baby plan.” Instead, Dux has an eye on the future. 
“We’ve got 2028 right around the corner,” Dux said. “If we’re not doing this now, we’re going to wrap this plan and not have a new one. We’re going to be the only university in town or maybe even in the country, that’s like, ‘We don’t have a sustainability plan.’”
Both Dux and Hyman have expressed excitement about the arrival of Carol Folt, USC’s newly appointed president. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan in August, Folt, a former biologist and science educator, named sustainability as one of her top priorities and said she recognizes student’s concerns about the issue. 
“I know that most of you feel that if we don’t do something, [our] planet is not going to be in good condition,” Folt said in August. “This is the time when we need to start taking action. This is the time when we need to teach every generation how to create a more sustainable world.”
With such support, Hyman remains optimistic for the future.
“This is monumental … this has never happened, to have a president that is such an ally,” Hyman said.
He added that ESA believes that one key step in achieving these goals is education. Similar to the requirement for all students to complete programs such as AlcoholEdu, ESA hopes to implement a similar required program to teach students about sustainability.
“One thing the ESA has been proposing for years now is some type of pre-enrollment engagement module,” Hyman said. “There is no requirement for students to graduate with any understanding of the importance of sustainability.”

The U.S. News & World Report released its 2020 rankings, listing USC one of the top 25 universities, tying with UC Berkeley for the No. 22 spot. 
All rankings are decided by scoring colleges across 15 academic indicators like class size, student-faculty ratio, selectivity of admissions and alumni donations and then using the score out of 100 to determine the rank. USC had an overall score of 78. Non-academic elements like social life and athletics, factors that may be important for students when deciding where to apply, are not included.
Factors such as success at retaining and graduating students within six years accounts for more than one-third of a school’s rank, and the report also looks at faculty salary, academic reputation, financial resources and average ACT and SAT scores.
Julie Posselt, an associate professor of higher education at Rossier, said rankings play a large role in a university’s status for incoming applicants. 
“Higher education is what we call in sociology a status economy,” Posselt said. “That means that [is] half of money and then half of power. Status is extremely important as a resource. Rankings are one indicator of status.”
Posselt also mentioned that there is evidence that colleges use rankings to manipulate admissions activities to either help them rise in rankings or protect their high position. She says these rankings are calculated using an algorithm that has nothing to do with public perception or scandals that have taken place but rather with endowment, financial resources and characteristics of faculty. 
Florence Yang, a sophomore studying computer science, expected USC to move down in the rankings following the University’s involvement in the college admissions scandal. The incident placed a negative national spotlight on USC, when the FBI revealed in March that more than 20 students were admitted to the University through a backdoor scheme using bribery and fake athletic profiles.
“None of the other students had anything to do with the scandal and the other parts of the school still work really hard to maintain USC as such a reputable school, but because of things that certain people did in the school it has to affect the whole reputation and perspective of the school from the outside is disappointing,” Yang said. 
Ani Sarkisyan, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said she thinks the rankings should take students’ perspectives of the school and campus issues into consideration.  
“By the actual ranking itself like how its created, it is accurate because they didn’t add a new criteria to the ranking,” Sarkisyan said. “They didn’t add how many scandals does the school have, if they were to add that category, no, [USC’s ranking] would not be accurate.” 
Aerlynn Ding, a freshman majoring in anthropology and international relations, said that rankings left her confused because of how much they differed depending on what website you looked at and were not an accurate representation reflection of the school. 
“Different rankings differ from each other,” Ding said. “For Niche, I think they ranked the social science department of USC pretty high, but for some of the other rankings they only emphasize school of Viterbi, Annenberg and the other schools.”
Posselt said that college applicants should understand that college rankings cannot paint a full picture of what a campus is like and thinks they should research what factors go into a school’s ranking. 
“Rankings are so widely used as an indicator of what is best that it becomes easy to forget that what is best can be defined in different ways,” Posselt said.

After a rocky 2-3 start this season, USC won all three of its matches at the Trojan Invitational this past weekend at Galen Center. All-American senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier returned from injury Saturday to help the Trojan cause.
The Trojans played without Lanier Friday night and went to five sets with a determined Yale team. Yale came into the match 0-4, so USC was favored to win despite its lackluster season start.
The serve and receive game continued to cause USC issues early in the tournament. The Trojans committed 11 service errors and were aced 13 times against Yale.
Those “free” points helped the Bulldogs win the second and fourth sets. USC committed two crucial service errors at the end of the second set that gave Yale a comfortable advantage. Freshman outside hitter Emilia Weske committed two service errors in the fourth set. Four more errors for the Trojans helped the Bulldogs to an easy 25-18 set win.
Throughout the tournament, Weske’s youth showed — she ended up committing eight service errors. 
“Some of it is a little fatigue,” said head coach Brent Crouch. “We had the five-setter last night. Emilia is a really aggressive server, and she still scored points for us even when she’s missing. When she’s hitting it in, we are winning a lot of points, but we need to get her error rate down a little bit.”
A couple of bright spots from the weekend were senior middle blocker Jasmine Gross and the overall blocking effort by USC’s front row. 
Gross was named tournament MVP after hitting .615 over the weekend. She shined in the Trojans’ most dominant performance of the season so far against 7-2 Villanova, racking up eight kills on 13 attempts.
As for the blocking game, USC consistently out-blocked its opponents and dominated the game at the net. The Trojans blocked nearly 30 balls to their opponents’ 14.
USC swept a tough Villanova team in dominant fashion. The Trojans held the lead throughout the second and third sets, winning them by 10 and 11 points, respectively. 
Following the successful weekend, Crouch is ready for his squad to get some time practicing as a unit. Crouch said he thought every player on the roster saw action at one point during the weekend.
The start of the season has had its ups and downs, but perhaps the Trojans are ready to lock in as they regain their star Lanier and a healthier senior opposite hitter in Emily Baptista.
In Lanier’s first start back against Howard after missing 14 days of practice, her sharpness was tested as the Bison consistently served the ball in her direction.
Baptista and Lanier proved their importance to the Trojans’ service game, providing seven out of the 10 aces in their last game of the tournament. 
USC markedly improved over the course of the weekend. This is a good sign as conference play begins in just 10 days with a highly anticipated match against UCLA.
The Trojans will shift their focus to getting healthy and staying healthy. The team’s depth gives it a higher ceiling than in prior years.
“So while we haven’t started clicking yet with the starting group, overall I think because people are getting out there and playing a lot … the team-building part is way more advanced than it was last year,” Couch said.
USC travels to San Diego this week for matchups against San Diego and Long Beach State.

USC football’s 45-20 victory over Stanford last week was a dominant effort, a stunning introduction of freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis and maybe the worst thing that could’ve happened to the Trojan fanbase. That last part sounds crazy, but hear me out.
USC is a historically great program with a blue blood mentality. The University claims 11 national championships, and the NCAA credits it with nine, which is tied for sixth most championships of all time. After dominating throughout the Pete Carroll era in the 2000s, the Reggie Bush-O.J. Mayo athletics scandal set the program back, and the team has spent this entire decade trying to regain that level of glory to no avail. Judging by the fanbase’s expectations, though, you’d think that USC was supposed to be a national title contender every season.
It’s good that fans have high aspirations, but they have to understand that it takes time to build a program that fits their view of what USC should be. 
Trojans fans are incredibly polarized; they’re either happy and boastful about everything, or they whine and complain about all aspects of the program. There is no in-between, and that’s why the Stanford victory wasn’t the all-encompassing triumph many fans made it out to be. It built insane expectations for what this team could accomplish this season, all of which came crashing during the Trojans’ 30-27 overtime loss to BYU in Provo Saturday.
The game was frustrating. Slovis threw three costly interceptions, including a horrible throw into traffic in overtime that was deflected and intercepted, sealing the loss when an incompletion would have given kicker Chase McGrath a field goal opportunity from close range to extend the game. The defense withered in its first day game, appearing gassed to the point of incompetence by the second quarter. 
Heralded offensive coordinator Graham Harrell was curiously conservative throughout the second half, seeming to call runs on every first and second down and leaving Slovis with some difficult third down situations. And let’s not forget special teams, which frequently gave Slovis the ball with terrible field position.
But let’s call this game what it was: A team that went 5-7 last season lost its true freshman quarterback’s first road game to a decent team in a challenging environment. If I had told USC fans that the team would dominate its second biggest rival and then narrowly lose on the road to a team like BYU, I don’t think they would have the reaction they’re having now. Because this game came in the aftermath of a shockingly enjoyable win that gave fans outlandish expectations, losing to BYU — who actually hung tight with No. 10 Utah through three quarters Week 1 — seems like doomsday.
Here’s the truth: These are the types of games that happen to a program of USC’s current caliber. Teams that eke into the Top 25 in the third week lose road games to less talented but still good opponents. Young teams lose on the road. The problem isn’t that USC didn’t play like a national championship contender, it’s that the fans had expectations that it would.
Fans are right that things need to change because the College Football Playoff should be this team’s ultimate goal. But head coach Clay Helton is probably not the person that will bring the Trojans to that level. The program needs to find an offensive line coach who can recruit the position better. The entire team needs to be instilled with a greater regard for discipline. All of these things and many more need to happen for fans’ justified wishes to be met.
But that doesn’t happen in a day. 
I’m tired of the massive mood swings the fanbase experiences from week to week and of students acting like they’ve followed this team from birth when it wins and being completely disinterested when it loses. Following the loss, a friend told me that redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink should be the starter. Seriously. I pressed him about how he could be so stupid as to call for Slovis’ replacement a week after he had one of the best performances in Trojan history. His response? “We lost to BYU. If you didn’t notice.”
One of my roommates (who knows nothing about football) said hours after the game, “I can’t believe we lost, but this reminds me of the Washington State game from our freshman year [in 2017]. We also had a young quarterback in a tough road game, and we went on to win the Pac-12 Championship. I believe we’ll do that again.”
The optimism is good-hearted but just as foolish as claiming the defeat is the end of the world. 
It’s a lot to expect a team that was just bowl ineligible and lost its starting quarterback for the season to win the conference championship, especially with talented teams like Utah, No. 16 Oregon and No. 22 Washington in the conference. These sort of all-or-nothing reactions destabilize the fanbase, and to some extent, the program, too.
Yes, the loss was unacceptable, but it’s also one game. This team has shown more in the past three weeks than it did all of last season. It’s making progress. Instead of a sudden jump to contender status, USC fans should look for the steady improvement that suggests this program can return to the mountaintop in the future. 
It’s time for fans to accept that USC is much closer to the middle tier of college football than the elite. A return to the top is always the goal, but it’ll be a lot better for everyone’s sanity if we can all be realistic in the meantime.

It’s hard to believe that, with the Billboard Hot 100 top-10 charting songs (including the number one ‘Fancy’), four platinum singles and a niche fan base with the loyalty of a European mafia, Charli XCX is still underrated.
The artist’s extra-layered bubblegum bass instrumentation has made her solo work too jarring for casual radio listeners, but the unashamed peppy ear-worminess hasn’t given her much praise from “for the heads” critics either. Despite what her deliciously cocky and hilarious Twitter feed may tell you, she is often left out of the conversation of powerhouse pop stars of the decade. 
However, her most recent album, “Charli,” which was released Friday, is 50 minutes of proof that she deserves more. Unique, open and self-aware, the LP is an undeniably Charli XCX project, and if all’s right with the world, anyone who listens will recognize her talent.
The opener “Next Level Charli” begins with the beckoned lyrics, “I go hard, I go fast and I never look back.” Charli’s right. She doesn’t. The girl has no problem bombarding her listeners with radiant noise. 
From start to finish, there’s always at least three glitzy, tech-heavy syrupy-sweet melodies playing at once (not including her vocals). Much like her mixtapes “Number 1 Angel” and “Pop 2,” Charli’s production regularly sounds like Candy Land’s Queen Frostine and Willy Wonka both took deadmau5’s MasterClass on techno production and decided to debut their work at the exact same time.
But unlike her past projects, “Charli” is laced with a sense of vulnerability. 
This time, the love and loss-after-love songs ring closer to the core with more wisdom. Charli seems to understand heartbreak and reconstruction better on ‘Charli’ than ever before. 
“Blame It On Your Love,” one of the album’s lead singles, is a calculated, cute piece of electropop that still manages to echo with self-empowerment and a towering middle finger energy that feels like a reaction to raw, real-life circumstances.
The chorus — “Every time I f*ck it up, I blame it on your love” — is all about deflection of responsibility; yet the subtext screams that the artist has grown and is taking ownership of herself more than she ever has. Plus, it features Lizzo, who has the Midas touch for this type of anthem.
On the eponymous LP, Charli XCX seemingly does the impossible by making several songs that are haunting and full of self-examination still equally danceable as her previous work. “White Mercedes,” a lovely ballad hinting that her “I never look back” line might be a bit of a front. So is “I Don’t Wanna Know.” 
Recent pop stars have benefited greatly in their songwriting from taking a more somber, self-reflective approach: Lorde’s “Melodrama” and Kesha’s “Rainbow” were two of the best records of 2017. Both sounded like a complete change of pace for both artists, though. Here, Charli is keeping her recipe, just turning out a completely different and (still) delicious product. It’s a tough tightrope to walk and she does so masterfully. 
The only flaw in “Charli” is that so many of the songs on it were already delivered to the public as singles. “Warm,” “February 2017,” “Cross You Out,”, “Gone” and “1999” were all previously released. This makes the record seem more like a “Best of Charli XCX in the last year” playlist rather than a wholly brand new statement. 
Still, the compilation is layered beautifully. All the songs appear at the right time — its structure is such that the listener just has to admire how far Charli XCX has come. 
The record also has the perfect batch of features. HAIM, Clairo, Kim Petras, Christine and the Queens, CupcakKe, among others, appear on ‘Charli.’ Their presence is complementary to her vocal performances and reminds us how forward thinking Charli XCX is. She’s a pioneer and has laid the musical groundwork for so many successful artists. 
The final song on the album, “2099” is a celebration of Charli XCX for everything she’s done. 
Featuring Troye Sivan, she pounds home her “never look back message” and continues to prove how much of a forward thinker she’s always been. Synth pop has brought characters like A.G. Cook, Tommy Cash (who’s also featured on ‘Charli’) and 100 Gecs to the mainstream. 
Charli’s genre is  a groundbreaking genre that many still don’t know what to do with, but are in awe of. “Charli” cements Charli XCX as synth pop’s non-negotiable grandmother.

Loving someone (or something) means showing it. 
You know the classic rom-com trope — the guy does some bold, sacrificial thing that shows the girl how much he loves her and they live happily ever until the screen goes dark. Thus we are meant to learn one of the simplest, toughest, noblest principles of love: If you love someone, prove it. 
I love movies, and I prove it by paying good money to see them. But, lately, it’s been a bit complicated: I haven’t been to the movies in about a month, haven’t really talked about them and haven’t written about them. If this were a relationship with a person, I’d probably call it. Still, I’m compelled to stop, consider and reflect on this trouble. Whose fault is it? Mine or the movies’?
If I wind the clock back just past a month, I come to a happy time in our relationship, a blissful memory that even reads like a fairy tale: “Once Upon A Time … in Hollywood.”
Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film revived that old passion I have for movies and not because I’m a Tarantino diehard who accepts everything he touches as gold. The movie was just that good. I saw it twice, once at the New Beverly Cinema, a cozy-cool cinema Tarantino manages. It was quite the peak for the me and the movies.
But all things must pass. A week later I was watching “Ready or Not,” the horror (?), dark satire that I didn’t quite get. Fun times were had, but I ultimately threw up my hands in nonchalance; I kept wanting more, and the film failed me. Now I’m almost a month removed from that lackluster experience. Yet, the meh taste remains — I’ve had nothing to reset my palate, nothing to quicken my heart to drive to a theater and slam down a wad of cash at the box office to see a good movie.
Maybe it’s my fault. Maybe I’m too picky. A lot of people loved “Ready or Not.” Yes, it was quite ambitious and unpredictable, but I personally got nothing out of it. Maybe I’m requiring too much from my movies. But then again, they require time and money, and who isn’t picky with their darlings? 
OK, so maybe the movies are to blame. This summer’s box office was hellish. Journalists questioned if we really should be scared or if a box-office decline is the new normal. Undeniably, this is a new era for the young art of film. Box office numbers will never reach the altitude they once did — even “Avengers: Endgame” had to be re-released to barely surpass the record “Titanic” set. “The Graduate” was the highest-grossing movie of 1967, a dramedy success that feels likely to never happen again for non-superhero/franchise films. 
Add to all this the amount of product being spouted out all around us. I don’t need to go into detail; we all live in the same world where every streaming site is an inexhaustible geyser of documentaries, true crime, bloated rom-coms and one-season (or 15 seasons for no reason; looking at you “Grey’s”) TV shows. According to Variety, Netflix had around 700 original TV shows and 80 original films in 2018. I don’t even watch 80 movies in theaters a year, so, theoretically, I could not go to the theater for a whole year and get my fill of entertainment at home on my couch. But, that wouldn’t be very good for our relationship. Yeah I can take a date to hundreds of outings, but if they’re all to EVK ‘cause I have extra meal swipes, I’ll start to look pretty bad really fast.
The reality is that movie theaters will die a very slow death. People still like going to the movies, just not every weekend — money’s tight and tickets are expensive (now multiply that by 10 for an undergrad). Why not just stay at home? We’ll go to the movies some other time.
If you’re most people, that “other time” will be when the next Avengers film premieres, or for the next Star Wars installment (although that’s not even a guarantee anymore); movies nowadays have to be bigger, not necessarily better — anything to get our posteriors out the door. 
Maybe I’m overthinking (as is normal for any relationship, right?). Maybe we’re just in a post-summer Sahara of good movies. Maybe everything will be fine come December, when the good bunch usually shows itself. I certainly hope so, because I don’t think I can go another month without catching a movie.
