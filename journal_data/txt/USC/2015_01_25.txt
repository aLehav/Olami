On Dec. 1, 2014, approximately 28,000 students around the world applied to USC to be considered for USC merit scholarships.  Last Friday, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions released the decisions to the 1,200 finalists.
Every student that applies to USC before the Dec. 1 deadline is considered for a merit-based scholarship. USC offers several scholarships, but there are four major awards that are need-blind: the Mork Family Scholarship, the Trustee Scholarship, the Stamps Scholarship and the Presidential Scholarship. The first three offer students full tuition, while the Presidential Scholarship offers a half tuition award. Students who are selected for these scholarships, however, have to go through an extra step in order to receive them — an in-person interview.
Interviews take place in late February and early March and will determine which students will win each award. Kirk Brennan, director of admission said that this year, the office has selected approximately 700 finalists for the Presidential Scholarship and fewer than 500 total for the other three. Brennan commented that the number of applicants this year is similar to those of previous years.
In total, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is expecting approximately 52,000 applications, which is slightly more than last year, out of which they will accept about 9,000. Last year, the admissions rate for USC was about 18 percent; Brennan says the office’s main focus, however, is on enrolling and awarding scholarships to the correct students and not hitting a target admission percentage.
As to what they look for in candidates for these scholarships, Brennan said they want students “who will make the biggest impact here at USC,” and that can take many forms.  Every candidate has excellent grades and test scores, but the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is looking for glowing letters of recommendation; demonstration of strong engagement not only in school but also in their community, and a strong character and good leadership skills in general. These students are expected to make contributions that will greatly impact and improve the university.
Alejandro Medina, a sophomore majoring in architecture and a recipient of the Presidential Scholarship remembers his experience of coming to campus for the interview.  Medina explained that the program encouraged him to come visit the USC campus and stay in the dorms with a fellow Trojan for a whole weekend, in which he was able to meet people, experience the university firsthand and prepare for his scholarship interview.
“I was extremely excited when I received the notification that I was a Presidential Scholarship finalist,” Medina said.  “Other universities only give you the money, but USC makes you feel like they really care, like they need you to be here. Not only do they make you feel special, but coming to campus gives you a feeling of what it means to be a Trojan; and that definitely shaped my decision of where to attend college.”
Medina explained that the interview process, though nerve-racking, made not only him, but also his parents, excited that he was soon to become a Trojan.
Finalists for these scholarships will be arriving on campus in late February and early March for their final round of interviews.
“We need the entire community to be aware of being good Trojans for the next generation of Trojans who are coming up,” Brennan said.
The remainder of the applicants that were not chosen as scholarship finalists will hear back from the university in early May.

The USC Association for Computer Machinery hosted the SS12 Hackathon: Code for a Cause on campus this weekend to increase awareness of issues in accessible computing. The hackathon encouraged the participants to create applications that will help better the lives of those who are disabled.
Teamed with Project:Possibility, an open source project that makes a powerful difference in the lives of disabled persons and software developers through open source software development, this event had more than 60 student sign-ups, including both undergraduate and graduate students.
Angelica Huyen Tran, a junior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, said that the event was  not just a regular hackathon because the apps that result from it will be used to benefit disabled people’s lives. Tran has been on the executive board of ACM for three years.
“In the previous year, we had an app that took in sound and identified whether it was a siren or a baby crying for people who are deaf. The app would flash the color on the screen corresponding to the respective sounds,” Tran said. “It’s really cool because you can get a bunch of apps for a good cause.”
The hackathon started Friday evening with a presentation on possible projects. Then, teams were formed and were given until 12:30 p.m. to code and until 2 p.m. on Sunday to prepare a presentation and a demo of their app. Food was provided throughout the event and prizes awarded included an external battery and Tetris lamp.
One group created an app in both Android and iOS versions for the hearing impaired.
“It relies heavily on visuals and tactile stimulus in order to convey rhythm. We wanted to emulate Dance Dance Revolution-type interface. We had to make a bunch of compromises moving forward given the time constraint,” said Joseph Goelz, a sophomore majoring in computer science.
Goelz said it was a valuable learning experience for him and helped him improve his coding skills.
“I feel this was the perfect way to get further involved [in programming] and my app development skills were nonexistent before,” Goelz said. “I’ve always been meaning to do it but I’m always afraid to set aside the time. It’s a big commitment, for a full weekend because I’ve always had homework assignments.”
Goelz said Professor David Kempe inspired him to stay in computer science through his unique and interesting approach to learning. In the future, Goelz hopes to improve his app.
“Realistically, it’s about a two-star app because there are bugs still and lots of functionalities that still could be added but for effort, five stars,” Goelz said.
In order to prepare the participants for this 36-hour hackathon, ACM hosted two workshops last week on Android and web development because these were the two most common ways people build apps for hackathons.
Another group created a multiplayer game app that uses a combination of high and low pitches. The goal of this game is to avoid crashing into obstacles by deciding whether to lean left or right using the emitted sounds.
Tran said there were mentors, mostly alumni, who are now working in the industry, throughout the event to help the participants.
“Hackathons in general are very useful to pick up some good computer science skills outside of the classroom. Participants also got to learn the full cycle of a project from start to finish while also learning to work in a team environment,” Tran said.

Since Jan. 16, when USC Transportation announced a new pilot program with Uber to supplement the Campus Cruiser program and reduce wait times during peak periods, the ridesharing app completed more than 1,600 calls in the first weekend of the partnership.
This new program with Uber, however, is only the latest in a series of changes since the beginning of the fall 2014 semester.
Though Campus Cruiser is not a new program at USC, the ride service has undergone many changes over the course of the fall semester, from an influx of new hires and vehicles, to an extension of the boundaries in which they operate. The transition came after an announcement by President C.L. Max Nikias early in the fall 2014 semester, declaring that wait times for a Cruiser exceed no more than 15 minutes.
“We were notified fairly late in the summer that we needed to maintain those wait times,” said USC Transportation Director Tony Mazza. “We had to very quickly get the staffing up to speed and get the cars on board. In retrospect it’s probably one of our biggest challenges.”
The department scrambled to adjust procedures and personnel in order to carry out Nikias’ promise as demand for the new, faster service increased. Now, Cruiser is experiencing record demand. By the time fall classes ended in December, Campus Cruiser had completed 94,044 calls in the fall 2014 semester, 27,809 calls more than fall 2013, with call volume up 42 percent from last year.
In the first weeks of the spring semester, Campus Cruiser has already seen similar increases in demand. As of Tuesday, Jan. 20, 9,350 total calls have been completed this spring — up 27 percent from last spring. Combined with the rides serviced by Uber, demand has increased 49 percent compared with the same dates last spring.
Now, Campus Cruiser, which employs more than 150 student drivers and maintains a fleet of about 40 vehicles, answers up to 1,400 calls on each of its busiest nights: Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
A semester after these major changes, Campus Cruiser seems to be maintaining their quickened pace, and the program will continue to evolve.
 
Safe travels
 
On July 24, 2014, 24-year-old Xinran Ji, a second-year graduate student studying electrical engineering, was found dead at his home in City Park Apartments, less than half a mile from USC’s campus. Ji had been walking home alone at 12:45 a.m. after a night of studying when police believe he was attacked with a baseball bat during an attempted robbery. Ji managed to stagger back to his apartment, where his roommate discovered him later that morning. This attack marked the third major violent incident to occur on or near USC’s campus in less than three years.
Following Ji’s death, the university enacted a round of security reforms, with the expansion of Campus Cruiser’s services included among the measures. In addition to bringing wait times for the service to 15 minutes or less, administrators also expanded the area of the neighborhood that Campus Cruiser services.
Prior to the change, wait times for Campus Cruiser had been known to last as long as 45 minutes, not including time spent on hold, which could reportedly last for 20 minutes or more.
In the first week of the fall 2014 semester, Campus Cruiser hired 29 new drivers, bringing the total number of drivers to 154. The program also acquired 13 more vehicles, and Dept. of Public Safety officers and students enrolled in the ROTC program at USC served as temporary Cruiser drivers.
During this influx of new hires, the training time for drivers was shortened from two weeks to two days, and then again to a single night.
According to Associate Director of Transit Michelle Garcia, the change hasn’t had any adverse effects.
“The boundary area is relatively small,” Garcia said. “If anything, even if you have a longer training period, on the job is where you learn … what the tricks of the trade are.”
Prior to this fall, trainee drivers would ride along with a more experienced driver for several shifts over a two-week period. Despite the abridged training, Garcia said there have been no unexpected increases in traffic accidents.
Nonetheless, Garcia said Campus Cruiser has followed up with new drivers hired this semester to iron out any remaining issues.
“I think at this point we’ve gone back through to all the people we hired in that express training and are working with them now to see, ‘Is this a training issue or are they not the right fit for the program?’ and trying to determine those things and deciding where to go from there,” she said. “For the most part, our management team has shared with me that people going through the one-day training have picked things up quickly.”
A former junior Cruiser driver, who wished to remain anonymous since Campus Cruiser sent a memo to employees not to speak with the press, was hired this fall and said he felt the shortened training period was a sufficient introduction to the program.
“I feel like even if I had been trained longer, the things that I would question, they were easily answered,” he said. “I don’t see why it would take two weeks to train actually.”
The driver said the training consisted of about two and a half hours of observing another driver, followed by three hours of supervised driving.
Because of the increase in drivers and vehicles and subsequent shorter wait times, demand for Campus Cruiser has skyrocketed, according to Mazza. In the first month of classes of fall 2014, Cruiser received almost 19,000 calls, 4,000 more calls than the same period last year.
A new phone system was implemented in mid-September to deal with increased call volume with the addition of a function that allows callers to use a call-back option, in which a caller can hang up and a dispatcher will call them back shen they have reached the front of the queue. Also, the area where dispatchers work is being reorganized in order to accommodate more dispatchers during a shift, according to Garcia.
She said call wait times now average about two minutes, and the longest call wait time she has heard of during the fall was 14 minutes.
All of these changes, however, occurred in the middle of USC’s fiscal year. According to Mazza, the Cruiser program was granted a budget amendment of an additional $500,000 in order to fund the new resources acquired during the fall semester, including new hires and new vehicles.
The road ahead
Mazza said even more changes are ahead for the program.
“Our challenge going forward, as it always has been, is that as our wait times decrease, demand increases,” Mazza said.
The activity of Campus Cruiser is closely monitored every day, according to Mazza, and a summary of the program’s activities is presented to senior administrators on a weekly basis.
Campus Cruiser receives about 1,000 calls per night, and officials estimate the number will rise to about 1,200 calls per night by February. According to Garcia, the spring is usually busier for Campus Cruiser than the fall, since the service operates an hour longer, beginning at 5 p.m. instead of 6 p.m. because it gets dark earlier, the weather is slightly rainier and freshmen who might not have known about Campus Cruiser in the fall begin to utilize it.
To accommodate this increased demand, Mazza also said the dispatch used to track and organize calls will likely be replaced next summer.
“The technology platform that Campus Cruiser operates on today has been in place since 2002, so about 12 years,” Mazza said. “It’s getting to the end of its life cycle.”
This new system will ideally be fully automated, meaning that calls will automatically be assigned to drivers, and dispatchers will no longer be necessary, according to Mazza. In the current system, one dispatcher might be managing the phone line, while another monitors radio traffic and assigns calls to cars.
“There’s definitely been some struggles due to call volume,” he said. “We want to work on efficiencies for dispatching. [Dispatching is] hard to do when it’s one or two people looking at a screen.”
Mazza said that there has also been talk of creating an app students can use to request a Campus Cruiser similar to the one used by app-based ridesharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, and incorporating a Campus Cruiser tracker into DPS’s recently released Trojan mobile safety app, LiveSafe. These mobile technologies would hopefully be released once the current dispatch system is replaced.
According to Mazza, as they’ve investigated options for new technology for the Campus Cruiser program, USC Transportation reached out to other universities with safe-ride programs. Their research found that Campus Cruiser is the largest, most comprehensive university program in the country.
University ride programs that come closest to the size of Campus Cruiser, including the programs at University of California, Berkeley and the University of Georgia, operate using large passenger vans to shuttle students around campus, and none give students an expected wait time.
“We have not been able to find any university that does the number of calls that we do … We’re really proud of what we do and what we’ve been able to accomplish this semester,” Mazza said.
In the meantime, Campus Cruiser hired additional drivers at the end of the fall semester to bring the total number to 200 to account for the loss of senior drivers who graduated in the fall and drivers who might be able unable to work in the spring because of schedule conflicts.
“People don’t want to wait,” he said. “No one wants to wait. We are committed to that 15 minute wait time and driving it down whenever we have the resources.”

USC football made a statement last year on National Signing Day. Coach Steve Sarkisian’s knocked his first big test at the helm of the program out of the park. Surprising analysts and fans everywhere, Sark pulled off a major coup landing the coveted trio of Damien Mama, Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu Smith. In addition to the heralded triumvirate, Sarkisian and company were also able to go into Florida and land a commitment from a physically imposing defensive back Lamont Simmons.
To finish with such a flourish was a testament to Sarkisian and his staff’s recruiting prowess. Landing one five-star recruit on signing day is huge, landing three is monumental.
In just one season, the impact of that day has reverberated throughout the Trojan program. Not only did Jackson and Smith emerge as two of the best freshmen in the nation, but landing those recruits also sent a national message: USC is back and a force to be reckoned with on and off the recruiting trail.
Instead of making headlines for losing commitments from heavily coveted prospects like Jalen Ramsey and Matthew Thomas, the Trojans were in the press for the right reasons, making a last minute entry into the national rankings. This offseason, Sarkisian and company look to have picked up right where they left off.
A few days ago, five-star linebacker Osa Masina verbally committed to USC. As one of the top previously uncommitted prospects in the country, Masina is a major pickup for a Trojan defense sorely in need of some playmaking ability within the linebacker corps.
While last year’s linebackers were instinctive and tough players, they lacked the raw athleticism and size of a premiere unit.
With the exception of possibly former inside linebacker Hayes Pullard, it would have been tough to foresee any of the linebackers getting meaningful playing time back when Brian Cushing, Keith Rivers and Rey Maualuga suited up for the cardinal and gold.
Along with early enrollee Cameron Smith, Masina could be an instant impact player for the Trojans. At 6’4” and 233 pounds, Masina already has the size to compete on the collegiate level. Once he gets into the weight room and works with the strength coaches at USC, opposing running backs will dread coming to the Coliseum for the next few years.
With Masina committing, despite wide receiver Tristan Payton changing his commitment from USC to the Unviersity of Central Florida, the Trojans now have close to a full class for National Signing Day 2015. If they can fill up the remaining spots with some of their highly coveted targets, USC has a chance to ascend to the number-one spot in the rankings.
What Sark did last year on NSD will look like child’s play if he is able to close in on Long Beach Poly defensive back Iman Marshall, Serra linebacker John Houston, Jr., Serra defensive tackle Rasheem Green, and another linebacker, Porter Gustin.
The Trojans are in legitimate play for all four of these prospects, and if the last few weeks have been any indication, it looks like they might bring in their highest-ranked defensive recruiting class of all time.
Last year, the Trojans were able to restock a thin secondary through recruiting. Now it is one of the strengths of the team.
If they are able to land Houston and Gustin to go alongside Masina and Smith, the linebacking corp will be an immediate strength.
Already, Sarkisian and his staff have addressed needs on the offensive and defensive line, bringing in four guys on offense and three on defense with the possibility of Green solidifying both sides of the line.
While it remains to be seen if USC will capture their remaining targets, it is nice to be back atop the rankings and bringing in top-shelf talent to the football team. Of course, this doesn’t mean much if the players aren’t able to develop and succeed once they take the field for the Trojans. As Smith and Jackson showed last year though, some guys are just destined for greatness. If USC can continue to bring those types of special players in, the team as a whole will raise their level of play.
The jury may still be out among the Trojan faithful about Coach Sarkisian’s                      in-game strategy and decisions, but no one can question his recruiting prowess or eye for talent. Washington, his previous school, had three first team   All-Americans last year. All three are highly rated professional prospects.
If Sarkisian was able to get that level of talent up to Seattle, it will be exciting to see what he can do in Los Angeles. Here’s hoping that the coaching staff’s second National Signing Day goes even better than their first one.

After opening the season with a 7-0 sweep against Loyola Marymount almost two weeks ago, the USC women’s tennis team played its first match at Marks Stadium over the weekend, raising its record to 3-0 after a victories over Denver and Pepperdine at the ITA Kick-Off Weekend.
With the bar set high, there was plenty of anticipation leading up to the event, as seniors prepared for their final home opener as members of the Women of Troy.
“[We have] the most amazing memories on these courts,” senior Zoë Scandalis said. “It helps so much when you’re home.”
The Women of Troy eased past Denver in their opening match of the tournament, shutting the Pioneers out 4-0.     Senior Gabriella DeSimone and freshman Meredith Xepoleas teamed up for a 6-2 victory over Denver’s sophomore/junior pair of Morgan Barnhill and Evy Van Genechten, and the No. 14-ranked combo of junior Giuliana Olmos and Scandalis battled to a 6-4 win over Gracia Mboko and Sonja Radosevic to clinch the doubles point for USC.
Scandalis admitted that it took some time to get a little bit of nerves out during their first home match, but the team really settled in and impressed during singles play. Olmos cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 win over Mboko, and Xepoleas earned USC’s third point with a 6-2, 6-2 victory against Charlotte Derbyshire.
Finally, freshman Gabby Smith wrapped things up for the Women of Troy, defeating Genechten 6-2, 6-2 and sending USC into the championship game.
After sealing the 4-0 shutout, the remaining singles matches were suspended. USC was in the lead in every contest when Smith clinched the victory, and all together, the team dropped just one set over the course of the entire match.
USC then went on to face Pepperdine in the championship on Sunday.
There, the Waves could not overcome the Trojans, as USC won the championship game by a score of 4-0.
A doubles victory from Zoe Katz and Sabrina Santamaria  earned the Women of Troy their first point, and individual wins from all six USC single’s players were enough to win the match to win the match in a dominate fashion.
The pairing of Olmos and Scandalis kicked off the Women of Troy’s dominance on the day with a 6-1 win.
Santamaria would also go on to capture the Women of Troy’s second point, defeating Pepperdine’s Michaela Capannolo, 6-1, 6-0.
Freshman Meredith Xepoleas would then keep the momentum going with a similar result, running over the Waves’ Danielle Feneridis 6-1, 6-1.
The tournament clincher would eventually come from senior Gabriella DeSimone, who capped off the day with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Pepperdine’s Christine Maddox.
The tournament victory secures the Women of Troy their place in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships, which will take place next month in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Looking ahead, USC’s next dual match is a repeat of Sunday’s championship game, as the team will travel to Malibu on Friday to take on Pepperdine.   Scandalis saw this as an opportunity, especially for the three freshmen on the team.
“It’s going to be a good test for us, because we have three freshmen,” Scandalis said. “And we’ve had two matches which have been pretty easily handled so far, and I think [Pepperdine] will be the first team to push back a little bit.”       The Women of Troy will then head to Charlottesville, Virginia for the ITA National Team Indoor Championships. They do not return to Marks Stadium until Feb. 14, when they host Vanderbilt and Texas on           back-to-back days.

In the first Intercollegiate Tennis Association action of the spring, the No. 1-ranked USC men’s tennis team defended its home territory in flawless fashion, defeating Louisiana-Lafayette and Santa Clara to top the four-team tournament this past weekend.
“I was really happy with the energy,” head coach Peter Smith said. “On the court, in the stands, I felt like everybody was really involved in the match. It’s so great to have the season start and have the season under way.”
The Trojans beat the Ragin’ Cajuns 4-0 on Jan. 23, the first day of the ITA Kickoff Weekend at Marks Stadium, to advance to the championship round. In doubles, the sophomore pair of Nick Crystal and Connor Farren defeated the Ragin’ Cajuns’ Will Huyton and Jake Wynan 6-2, and the No. 1-ranked doubles duo Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz defeated Louisiana’s Jarred Wynan and Coleman Wahlborg 6-3 to put the Trojans up 1-0. Trojan senior Eric Johnson and junior Max de Vroome were leading Edgar Lopez and Damian Farinola 5-4 when play was suspended.
De Vroome and Crystal led the Trojans’ in singles play of the first round. De Vroome dispatched Vlad Kramarov and Crystal routed Huyton, both by tallies of 6-1, 6-1. No. 3-ranked Hanfmann topped Lopez 6-2, 6-2 and with three victories in singles, the Trojans gained three points and completed the sweep of the Ragin’ Cajuns.
De Vroome turned it around and became a big part of the Trojans’ win Friday after what he believes was a slow start.
“I started off a little rusty, made a few mistakes, but then [Krzysztof Kwinta], our assistant coach, came on,” De Vroome said. “He told me to play a little heavier, a little more on the ready. So I stayed back a little more, waited for my opportunities, and I took the chances when I got them.”
In the final of the event on Jan. 24, the Trojans pulled off another sweep against Santa Clara. Hanfmann and Quiroz defeated the Broncos’ Ashot Khacharyan and Ilya Osintsev 6-2 as Johnson and de Vroome took down Mikheil Khmiadashvili and Sam Bertram 6-1, clinching the doubles’ point for the Trojans.
Quiroz finds he and his fellow seniors are trying to make the most of every match in their final year.
“It’s really special for the four seniors playing our last season,” Quiroz said. “We’re really happy to be here and enjoying all the time we’re spending on the courts. We’re just trying to get betting, we’re just starting the season. We have great expectations for the season, so I think we did great today.”
In singles, Crystal continued his dominance with an immaculate match in the final, defeating Michael Standifer 6-0, 6-0. Senior Jonny Wang followed suit with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Khmiadashvili and Johnson rounded out the second sweep with a 6-3, 6-2 win against Sebastian Mathieu.
De Vroome felt his team fed off each other’s energy during the match.
“It’s definitely contagious to play well, seeing each other play well and pumping each other up,” De Vroome said.
With their resounding victory this past weekend, the Trojans clinch a spot at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Chicago, Illinois, next month. Smith has liked what he’s seen from the defending NCAA champions in the early stages of the season.
“I think we’re in a great place,” Smith said. “I think the guys are really looking to get better, they’re really open, really motivated, and they’re getting after it.”
Up next, the Trojans will travel to Athens, Georgia, this weekend to face the Florida Gators and Georgia Bulldogs. Though the season is still young, Quiroz and the Trojans’ minds are already on the long run — defending their throne.
“USC always sets their goals really high,” Quiroz said. “But you know what, we look at the big picture, so we just keep getting better, keep working on our game, and we improve for May, which is our main goal.”

The Trojans men’s basketball team (9-10, 1-6 Pac-12) lost its fourth straight game with a 59-55 loss to the Oregon State Beavers (14-5, 5-2), who won their third game in a row.
USC was led by redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt with 17 points, including 4-7 from three, while sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic added 13 points and 6 boards. Freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin had a    game-high seven assists but only shot 2-11 from the field for 9 points. McLaughlin has lost his stroke as of late, as he only shot 4-15 in the Trojans’ loss to Oregon.
With his Hall of Fame dad in attendance, OSU guard Gary Payton II had a game-high 21 points and 10 rebounds, his sixth double-double of the season. Forward Jarmal Reid added 14 points off the bench, the same amount scored by the entire bench of the Trojans. The surprising Beavers are now 12-0 at home.
“If you ask me what the difference in the game was, our guards have got to step up and make some shots,” said USC head coach Andy Enfield
The Beavers pulled away in the first half with an 11-2 run led by Reid. It looked as if the Beavers were going to roll to a comfortable win, but the Trojans fought back with a 9-0 run of their own to cut the first half deficit to two. The first half was a back-and-forth affair that included seven lead changes and one tie in the first eight minutes of the game.
Oregon State then went on to take an early 8-point lead in the second half, thanks to three consecutive shots from distance from forward Olaf Schaftenaar, but the Trojans stormed back with an 11-0 run, capped by a three from Reinhardt, to take a 3-point lead before Oregon State came charging back and took the lead for good after a layup by Reid with 10:02 remaining.
USC had a chance to tie the game with a three late in the game, but sophomore guard Julian Jacobs turned the ball over with nine seconds left and Payton clinched the game with a free throw that sent USC home having lost both games in Oregon.
USC was not dominated in any aspect of the game but Oregon State did just enough to hold off the Trojans.
The Trojans continued to shoot poorly from the field, only making 34 percent of their baskets. They are currently tied for last in the Pac-12 in field goal percentage, averaging 41.9 percent from the field. And while not the sole reason for the defeat, the Trojans did commit 10 turnovers, something that plagued this young team early in the season.
Despite the poor performance by the Trojan bench, redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark continued to be productive with 8 points and 8 rebounds to lead the second unit.
The freshmen for USC struggled again against the Beavers. Guard Elijah Stewart only scored 2 points, that came on a breakaway dunk and forward Malik Martin was held scoreless in his limited playing time.
Martin only played three minutes and was replaced in the starting lineup by guard Malik Marquetti, who was also held without a point in the contest.
“They played really hard, they played excellent defense,” Enfield told the Los Angeles Times. “Unfortunately, we came out on the short end of the stick.”
The Trojans return home on Thursday to face the Colorado Buffaloes (10-9, 3-4) as they look to improve their conference record to close out the month. Colorado is led by guard Askia Booker, as they are dealing with injuries to their two big-time scorers, forwards Josh Scott and Xavier Johnson.
The Buffaloes are coming off a win over Washington State as they head to Los Angeles to play USC and UCLA. Colorado is winless on the road thus far this season and USC is 6-4 at home.

If art is a lens through which a society can view itself, the film and television industry has some curious insights into the perception of Asians.
The industry is venturing into brave new territory in casting decisions with the Netflix-produced historical fiction epic Marco Polo, which features a cast of Asian actors, including Benedict Wong as Kublai Khan and Korean-American Rick Yune in a high-profile supporting role. The $90 million Netflix production has been almost universally railed by critics, but Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently told the Huffington Post that the show has been a “massive success.” Which brings a question to the forefront: is America ready for an Asian lead actor?
In an interview with the Daily Trojan last year, former Star Trek actor and Japanese-American George Takei commented on the potential of Asian American actors in Hollywood.
“We [Asian-American actors] have come a long way, but there’s still a long way to go,” Takei said.
Perhaps the question of an Asian lead actor is a salient one considering that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that all of the acting nominees for 2015 were white actors and actresses. It was the second time that all the acting nominees have been white since 1998, but it’s a tad simplistic to make the argument that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is propagating the ideal of a white lead in the film industry.
Instead, the decisions which suggest a pro-white bias are made by casting directors — and the casting directors of Marco Polo have spoken. If Marco Polo is even remotely as positively popular as Hastings claims, then it might lend credence to the notion that America is ready to see an Asian-American lead actor.
There seems to be a logical jump in this argument, so I’ll fill it in for you: Marco Polo is, in some ways, as awful as advertised. At its worst, it’s an exorbitantly expensive Game of Thrones knock-off masquerading as a historical epic. It features a white (well, Italian) lead actor in Lorenzo Richelmy — who also happens to play one of the most insufferable lead protagonists in television.
Critically speaking, when a television show’s lead actor and primary protagonist is its greatest weakness, it’s going to run into some nasty reviews. In spite of these reviews (which have contributed to the show’s 30 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes), I want to echo the sentiments of Stephen Lynch of the New York Post: If you look beyond the forehead-flattening foibles of Richelmy’s portrayal of Marco Polo, there’s actually something very interesting happening in those 10 densely produced episodes — the performances of the Asian actors and actresses are brilliant, almost without exception (alright, one big princess-sized exception).
Chin Han (Last Resort, The Dark Knight) naturally exudes a regal iciness as the bloodthirsty and ambitious Chancellor Jia Sidao, and Wong’s Kublai Khan is as shrouded in grandiose, sybaritic mystique as he is in wisdom and eminent likeability. Netflix scraps the “white savior” narrative and manages to not grossly overstate Polo’s significance (cue all the dirty glances to Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai). The power brokers in Marco Polo are the Khans and Sidao — Polo is historically accurate insofar as his function, which is that of the awestruck storyteller and the powerless-yet-savvy outsider. The show guides its themes subtly and is a visual marvel with an uncanny sheen befitting its $90 million price tag. Though it’s not exactly worth the price of a monthly subscription, the show is worth a full binge-watch. It’s not a disappointing show in the least, and that’s due entirely to the work of its Asian cast.
Most importantly, perhaps, Polo holds a solid 8.3 rating from more than 15,000 IMDB users — a stark contrast to its Rotten Tomatoes aggregate score, which looks more like a Congressional approval rating. The public has spoken, and for a show that relies significantly on the interplay between its Asian actors, it’s an encouraging sign for the viability of Asian leads.
The portrayal of Asian-Americans in television will get another look with the upcoming ABC series Fresh off the Boat, based loosely on the Eddie Huang-penned memoir of the same name. The show stars comedian Randall Park (The Interview) as Louis Huang, the father of three children who wishes to live the American Dream.
It would be a huge step for the Asian American community for Park and Fresh off the Boat to avoid falling into the same time-worn culturally appropriated tropes and to be funny on its own merits — admittedly a tall task considering Park himself is fresh off a role that relied on lampooning a certain North Korean dictator.
In either case, it’s a brave new step for the television industry to start embracing Asian actors as more than culturally appropriated caricatures and model minorities — here’s to hoping it pays off critically this time.
Daniel Grzywacz is a senior majoring in anthropology and neuroscience. He is also the lifestyle editor at the Daily Trojan. His column, “The Showbiz Must Go On,” runs Mondays.
why does the leading man have to be Asian-American, why not Asian-Canadian or just Asian (like Bruce Lee). Wouldn’t that serve the same purpose?
Badly written headline – “Hollywood is ready for an Asian-American leading man.” Maybe, but Hollywood apparently is not yet ready, although the careless headline writer may be.

As the months between now and April draw to a close, it’s time to prepare those flower crowns and lacy tops; Coachella is almost upon us. The lineup was announced earlier this month and if you were lucky enough to grab tickets before the ever-beloved festival sold out, you have probably been planning a clever strategy to catch all your favorite artists. But for those of you who are hoping to avoid the masses upon masses who will be stampeding to see Drake or AC/DC, fear not; the smaller-print bands show incredible promise for some good tunes and great performances.
Though AC/DC is a classic, day one offers many other opportunities to rock out without having to squint at Angus Young from behind 70 rows of people precariously atop shoulders. In fact, you don’t even have to look too far — another Angus is performing the very same day. Angus & Julia Stone is a brother-sister folk band from Australia.
Their newest album sees them reunite after going solo. But the time apart seems only to have increased the haunting way her pixie vocals and his husky voice combine. Their affinity for poetic simplicity is a quality that should be widely envied in the industry. Their lyrics are effortlessly relatable but what truly resonates is the way they sing their songs. Emotion bleeds through every word; you can feel everything they express and everything they’re holding back. In one of their newest songs, “All This Love,” Julia repeats “I will follow you” and while it’s probably not what she had in mind, it’s a good way to describe their music. It follows you, whether it’s playing softly in the background as you clean your room or if it’s playing surround sound as you lay in bed. Their performances promises to be an even better version of their normal gigs. Their live performances display their complete devotion to their music. Just as their songs burrow into the listeners soul, it seems to live in theirs. Watching the pair on stage means watching them lose themselves in the music but not distancing the audience, instead, inviting the audience to get lost with them. If you want beautiful music or just to be able to slowly sway about for an hour, make sure to stop by the duo’s stage.
If mellow indie doesn’t call out to you, partially hidden in the obscure small print of day two’s line up is French electro-pop trio Yelle. Its lyrics aren’t ones I recommend you repeat to your French professor in class, but they are perfect for dancing around to and echoing at the top of your lungs. The group is led by lead singer Julie Budet for whom the band is named. While time has brought Yelle from playful lyrics over synth beats to a more melodic focus, dancing is still always at the pinnacle of its album. Its performances are marked by a mixture of robotic, choreographed moves and wacky struts across the stage. Yelle attracts international fans who are ready to get down and funky. Why go to a jam-packed headliner when you can join part two of the French Revolution?
To end your celebration of small print, big parties is the progressive-pop kings, Saint Motel. The band has only just signed to Elektra Records after having toured with big names such as Arctic Monkeys, Weezer and Imagine Dragons. This means its Coachella debut is your chance to jump on its bandwagon and maintain your hipster credibility before they hit it big. The band proves to be a well-organized, ecstatic mess of sweet harmonies and ’80s-like glam pop synth wrapped up in the upbeat indie sound this generation has come to love. Its music and intoxicating lyrics are impossible not to dance and clap to. Its past albums and EP’s boast songs that range from a malicious and seductive indie rock to playful pop and everything in-between, but the magic comes from the fact that no matter where on the music-genre spectrum they are, they never lose their core sound. The band is always recognizable; not just because of its love of clapping and chanting in its music, but because its sound never sounds forced.
Everyone loves the headliners — they’re headliners for a reason — but lesser-known bands are sure to show that it’s not the size of the font that matters. Angus and Julia Stone will provide the perfect place to bemoan lost loves and the general heartbreaks of life without actually thrusting listeners into a state of depression. Yelle and Saint Motel will attract those who are ready to dance, which means fun memories of sore limbs from dancing so long. Whether you’re there for the Top 100 hits or the obscurity of the unknowns, you’re in for a wild ride at Coachella this year.

If an asteroid the size of Los Angeles were hurtling toward Earth, threatening to put an end to life and the very record of its existence, governments would mobilize immediately in an international effort to deflect it. Every country in the world, along with a retinue of top scientists, would rush to the negotiating table, ready to pour entire GDPs into the initiative. No expense would be spared.
Linda Xu | Daily Trojan
Though the unprecedented magnitude of the situation might cause some initial disagreement over the best approach to resolving imminent doom, there is no doubt that we would eventually arrive at an agreed-upon solution. And we would do so rather quickly. Why? Because even though the political and financial costs of such an operation would be astronomically high, the consequences of the alternative, while not entirely understood, would be decisively negative and irreversible.
So why is it that in addressing climate change — a matter of more insidious danger, top political figures are reluctant to adopt policies concurrent with the prevailing science? In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) endorsed the unequivocal reality of atmospheric and ocean warming, and for the first time in the IPCC’s existence, declared the extreme likelihood of human influence as the dominant cause of these trends.
The IPCC Report is not anomalous in its conclusions. A 2013 conglomerative study out of the University of Queensland’s Global Change Institute considered nearly 12,000 climate science abstracts from peer-reviewed journals, finding overwhelming consensus in the opinion that recent warming is anthropogenic.
Despite what amounts to a smoking gun of scientific evidence, policymakers are still dragging their feet. In the United States, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, recently named chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, continues to deny the very existence of man-made climate change, a manifesto made public in his 2012 book, The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.
Of greater offense are politicians like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has publicly acknowledged global warming and human contribution to the phenomenon, has rejected policies that could mitigate the further accumulation of greenhouse gases. In 2011, he vetoed New Jersey’s involvement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program for carbon emission in the Northeast.
The refusal to take action on climate change isn’t an exclusively American oversight. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott wrote in his political memoir Battlelines that “debate rages among scientists” on the “unknown” and “perhaps even benign” effects of climate change.  These views manifested in regressive action last July when the Australian Senate made good on Abbott’s campaign promise to “ax the tax” and repealed the country’s carbon pricing program.
Far too often, high-level officeholders default to the “I am not a scientist” excuse, as if this claim somehow pardons them from enacting responsible legislation. If anything, such a statement necessitates a reliance on scientists. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is currently exploring a run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, might not have a background in geology or chemistry, but there is no shortage of potential advisers who do. Failure to incorporate their expertise in a policy platform exhibits an inexcusable neglect that will prove inauspicious against the test of time.
Time is the chief adversary in the fight against climate change. As with the hypothetical asteroid tumbling toward Earth, the risk presented by continued warming grows every day. Wildfires, flooding and the devastation of coastal communities by tropical storms and rising seas are amplified by our inaction. Not far from sight, major crop failures and the proliferation of diseases like malaria constitute a direct affront to the sanctity and security of human lives. The costs of mitigation are certainly high, but, as reported by the IPCC, they will only rise if we continue on this sluggish trajectory.
Neglect of the scientific literature amounts to a tremendous disservice on the part of public leaders who identify as climate skeptics. Their resistance to progress puts everybody, including their constituents, in the way of harm. Though rogue asteroids might only be the stuff of science fiction and Earth’s deep past, the occurrence of climate change poses a reality of comparable nature. And this asteroid is growing dangerously close.

Polluting the atmosphere and deforestation are the main causes of climate change.  There’s no reasonable doubt about it.  But to change course we need new laws and policies.   But the problem is more than half the members of the U.S. Congress are NOT on board with any plan to reduce global emissions.  They are on record saying that humans are not the cause of global warming despite what our respected scientific institutions have been telling us.  They reject the reality and put our future generations at risk.
More of us, from all corners, need to confront them and work to see them replaced with law makers
willing to face and deal with the reality.
Please join the efforts.

the largest difficulty around with climate change is what are we going to do with the people that say no. Like every human endeavor, there are limitations. Are you ready for a global war? Free peoples do not take kindly to orders from the UN. Will war to kill the nonbelievers cause more climate harm? Scientists are not always right. Sometimes science is wrong for hundreds of years. Consensus among a small group is not enough. If the science is correct, it will take 70 years to see the single degree of effect. Even then, the factors that make up my mitchell sodium that any change are so numerous, that skeptics will easily be able to attribute the one degree to another cause.
I suspect that human-generated combustion activity may very well be creating significant global warming. But it doesn’t matter. 
The politicians all over the world who can make changes are driven by their own selfish motives and so are the business and industrial persons who influence them. The short-term costs of necessary changes to industry and transportation are simply too high. It is profoundly easier and more self-serving for them to do nothing. “Let future generations worry about it,” they say to themselves, “it isn’t my problem – and I am not going to end my career for something in the future that will not happen until I am long gone anyway.”
That’s an easy question to answer.  No one believes the IPCC.  This issue was kicked off with a poorly made movie filled with lies and half truths.  Narrated by Al Gore (a professional liar) pointing to charts and graphs (that were faked).  Telling of polar bears dying off (when their population is actually on the increase).  Reporting on a consensus of climate scientists that were coerced (climate gate).  Shall I go on?  Any scientist or politician who openly contests the failed theory of man caused global warming is in danger of character assassination or political ruin or both.  Any person such as myself is instantly labeled as a crack pot, idiot, misinformed neanderthal, or any one or more of a hundred choice pet names.
All this and still no one in the climate alarmist crowd is proposing anything constructive to help with the claimed damage we humans are causing by living on this planet.  US Government is regulating Thorium liquid salt reactors into oblivion.  The time required to do testing is sometimes measured in decades.  It is sure odd this is the case when Thorium energy production is the best hope of mankind to move into the next level of human advancement, cheap, clean, safe, energy and the mere thought of it makes the worlds oil economy shudder with fear.  If carbon dioxide is such a serious problem why are we not developing forests?  Two trees per week for each man woman or child and soon we would have a huge carbon sink to sequester in.  But no it is all about taking money and freedoms from citizens.  How convenient that the only workable answer to the climate alarmist problem is to tax and restrict.  It’s too bad there isn’t a way to include disarm US citizens in this manufactured problem as well.
Your comments about Gore and the state of climate science are ridiculous.  
Odd how you talk about thorium energy and planting trees but deny there’s a climate change problem.  What tha?

On Friday, CNN reported that the Pentagon intends to deploy 400 troops and potentially hundreds of additional military personnel to the Middle East to train and equip “moderate Syrian rebels.” This action is being touted as an attempt to counter ISIS forces in the country that are rapidly gaining strength and territory. In terms of historical precedent, such a move by the Pentagon is not unusual. However, attempts by the United States to arm and train troops in places like Guatemala and more recently, Iraq, have failed miserably — often resulting in more violence.
In 1954, during the period of anti-communist fervor, the CIA closely watched the events that were transpiring in Guatemala. Former Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz had served as the democratically elected president for three years after winning the election with aid from leftist groups, including the Guatemalan Communist party, and was slowly instituting reforms that were greatly changing the Guatemalan sociopolitical composition Along with fears stirred up by American business interests that were being damaged in the area, the U.S. government and President Dwight Eisenhower felt threatened by Árbenz’s ties to communist nations and communist ideals. Thus, the CIA began arming anti-communist rebels in order to stage a coup d’état. The coup succeeded in installing a brutal military regime and creating popular discontent that resulted in a 36-year civil war riddled with genocide, slaughter and “disappearances” of rebel fighters.
Psychologist Noam Chomsky argued that Guatemala “remains one of the world’s worst horror chambers” as a direct result of U.S. intervention in 1954. But besides the human rights abuses that have plagued Guatemalans since the CIA-assisted coup, the violence in the country has caused foreign policy and immigration crises for the U.S. This summer, a flood of children crossed the U.S.’s southern border fleeing violence, paralyzing the government systems intended to help them and igniting a debate about anti-immigration. In addition, Guatemala receives about $300 million in aid per year to combat rampant poverty, often the result of unchecked violence. In the end, an action intended to prevent threats to American business interests and political ideology was a disaster in terms of human rights, business interests and political security.
For a more recent example, look no further than U.S. involvement in Iraq. Based on dubious claims that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. invaded and overthrew the government of Iraq. This governmental collapse sparked sectarian violence and civil war and opened the door for Al-Qaeda to gain a foothold in the territory. Despite being racked with violence, Iraq drafted and approved a new constitution, creating a new permanent government and held elections. These actions, however, were tainted by persistent insurgency as sectarian violence escalated. The war escalated, but the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq was killed by American forces, and Hussein was convicted of crimes against humanity and killed. Finally, the U.S. began to prioritize training Iraq’s armed forces and by 2009, the U.S. relinquished security duties to Iraqi forces but remained in the country until 2011 to train troops. These newly trained Iraqi troops immediately faced threats of destabilization due to the Arab Spring, as well as increased violence catalyzed by the Syrian Civil War. In 2014, Iraqi soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts in Mosul as ISIS militants, a then-nascent extremist group, overran the city. In short, attempts to train troops over the course of two years utterly failed to accomplish the goals of security, stability and counterterrorism in the region.
Now the Pentagon wants to send troops into Syria. The operation might mirror that of Guatemala, in which rebel troops whose true motives are unknown ceaselessly perpetuate violence in an attempt to gain power. The operation might turn out like Iraq in which training troops becomes an indefinite leech on money and time while showing no discernible benefits. Or, if operations go very far afield, arms might end up in the hands of ISIS militants through defeating or capturing the “moderate rebels who are being trained.” History repeats itself — it’s about time the government learns from it.
