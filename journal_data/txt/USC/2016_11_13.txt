Along with choosing the nation’s next president, L.A. voters made important decisions about several issues important to the local community including homelessness, transportation and jobs on Election Day. Five out of the seven city and county measures on the ballot were approved: Measures A, M, HHH, JJJ and SSS.

Measure M will raise the sales tax by a half-cent in order to fund the expansion of public transit in Los Angeles. Jeffrey Sellers, an associate professor of political science and public policy, explained that while prices will go up slightly in the short term, the long-term goal of the measure is to bring public transit to underserved communities.
“All goods in stores, with a few exceptions like food and other essentials, will be a little more expensive for students and everyone else,” Sellers said. “The specific improvements in the plan include a lot of incremental measures that have been carefully distributed geographically around the region to make the case that every neighborhood received something.”
M’s long-term plan is to make improvements to highway infrastructure in addition to building and creating more rapid bus transit in the Los Angeles area. The goal is to increase the usage of public transportation in the city. Plans include a subway beneath Wilshire Boulevard and from Simi Valley to LAX. M will also enhance bike transportation in the city.
“In our area of central L.A., the improvements include bike paths along the L.A. River from downtown and a 3.8 mile streetcar line in the downtown business district,” Sellers said. “Commuters to the Downtown area will benefit from a variety of express lanes, regional rail and new Metro extensions.”
Jessica Yu, a senior studying policy, planning and development, said that although M will reduce LA traffic, there is a possibility that many current communities might be displaced.
“With the onset of heavy development in these transit areas, M could rapidly drive up housing prices and force current residents there to move,” Yu said. “I think that developers and city and county leaders need to not only be aware of this, but also address it and find a way to prevent pushing out any communities as much as possible.”
Measure HHH increases property taxes by roughly .01 percent to build 10,000 units of permanent housing for the homeless population in Los Angeles. These housing units are meant to include on-site assistance through social workers and mental health counselors.
Jennifer Ailshire, an assistant professor at the USC Leonard Davis school of Gerontology, said that HHH provides the necessary resources for homeless individuals to permanently live off of the streets.
“Efforts to combat homelessness need to be focused not just on getting people into housing but getting them into permanent affordable housing so the risk of becoming homeless again is minimized,” Ailshire said. “We need a more permanent path out of homelessness if we are to have any hope for reducing homelessness in L.A. and HHH provides both the vision and funding to accomplish this.”
Benjamin Henwood, an assistant professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, said that HHH was imperative in addressing the concern that L.A. residents have about the visibility of homelessness.
“The county has been tracking the number of homeless individuals that would need to get housed in order to end homelessness and get to zero,” Henwood said. “HHH, in my mind, was a necessary measure if we seriously want to have a chance at addressing and ending homelessness.”
Henwood said that HHH also has challenges, as building permanent supportive housing will take time and agreement with many Los Angeles communities.
“The pushback from communities and the concern of ‘Is this building going to go in my neighborhood near my house?’ and the ‘not in my backyard’ issues I think are going to play out over and over again now that this is passed,” Henwood said.
Henwood added that HHH will require a lot of work to be put into effect.
“It’s great that it is passed and there will be an opportunity to do a lot quickly, but in order for those 10,000 to come online it’s gonna take time and it’s gonna take public persuasion,” Henwood said.
Some strategies are to convert existing motels into permanent support housing.”
Moreover, Henwood said that getting the people into the permanent supportive housing is only a portion of the battle.
“The issue is whether we have enough trained people to coordinate care and provide care,” Henwood said. “That should be talked about now. What we’re trying to do at the social work school is get people interested in this type of work so that we can develop graduates who want to work with this population, have the skills to work with this population and understand all the work that needs to be done.”
Measure JJJ, also known as Build Better LA, is an initiative requiring standard wages for construction workers and affordable housing. The measure, which was sponsored by labor unions and affordable housing developers, won the support of nearly 64 percent of L.A. voters. JJJ requires developers to assign a percentage of units in new apartment and condominium residential buildings for low-income tenants.
County Measure A will raise property taxes by 1.5 cents per square foot to pay and maintain buildings and open parks. Over 70 percent of L.A. voters approved this measure.
Measure SSS extends pensions to new airport police officers and allows them to enroll in the police and firefighter pension fund.

They held up signs saying “Dump Trump” and “Brown, Proud and Terrified,” and chanted slogans like “Immigrants are welcome here” and “Not my president.” Cars honked in show of support and drivers leaned out of their windows to give the people passing by high fives as they made their way down Figueroa Street toward USC.
Emily Smith | Daily TrojanCivil unrest · Protestors hold up signs at an anti-Donald Trump rally that attracted thousands to downtown Los Angeles on Saturday morning. This was the largest gathering to take place in L.A. since the election results.
The group of about 200 protesters passed by campus Saturday afternoon after splintering off from a larger gathering that marched from MacArthur Park to the Federal Building. According to the Los Angeles Times, as many as 8,000 demonstrators filled the streets downtown in the largest protest to take place in Los Angeles since the election of Donald Trump to the presidency last Tuesday. Protests there were mostly peaceful, with no arrests made on Saturday, though some freeway ramps were blocked, the Los Angeles Times reported.
The splinter group followed Figueroa Street toward campus and briefly staged a sit-down at the intersection of Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard. Los Angeles Police Department officers redirected traffic and formed a motorcade ahead of the protesters, warning cars ahead that they were coming. The group went as far south as Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, where several dozen people kneeled in remembrance of the civil rights leader and chanted “Black Lives Matter,” before turning on Vermont Avenue and heading back toward Downtown.
The demonstrators included a number of USC students, some of whom started at the very beginning in MacArthur Park and others who joined the crowd as it passed by campus. William Yelton, a senior majoring in film and television production, said that he came because he wanted to send a message not just to Trump, but to a Republican-dominated Congress, that the people did not support the divisive rhetoric the President-elect employed against women, people of color, immigrants and LGBT people.
“I acknowledge that Donald Trump is our president — I don’t think any of this is going to stop that,” Yelton said. “But without checks and balances in our government, we’re here to say, ‘No, you can’t just do whatever you want.’ We’ve made a lot of progress, and we’re not going to turn back the clock.”
Noha Ayoub, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, said the protests were a reminder to the president-elect that the plans he has announced — such as deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States or repealing the Affordable Care Act — will not be tolerated.
“Thirty years from now when we look back at 2016, I want to be able to say that I was doing something and not just lying around my apartment, business as usual, because it’s not,” Ayoub said. “There’s something so fundamentally abnormal and wrong about this year’s election that cannot be ignored. I think my anger manifested in the sense that I wanted to be part of the solution and not just a bystander.”
The protests in Los Angeles are part of a national wave of discontent that has emerged in the wake of Tuesday’s election result, with people taking to the streets in New York City, Portland, Oregon; and Cincinnati, Ohio. While violence erupted when a man was shot during a march in Portland, Mayor Eric Garcetti praised the demonstrators’ peaceful protest in Los Angeles and supported their right to exercise their First Amendment rights.
“I know the headlines are always the few people who jump onto a freeway or two or three people who spray paint something,” Garcetti said in an interview on CNN. “We’ll always deal with lawless behavior. The main story is that Americans, not just in my city but around the country, are saying we want to continue to embrace people regardless of how they worship God, who they love, where they live or even immigration status.”
Agree with me?
Lets just throw out law and order, the constitution … Trump and the middle class won this election, get over it.

Saturday will be remembered as the day the Trojans traveled up to Seattle and handed the No. 4 Huskies their first loss of the season. However, four hours earlier and 1,137 miles south, USC pulled off another major upset — in the pool — as the No. 2 men’s water polo ended No. 1 UCLA’s 57-game win streak in an 8-7 thriller at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Sarah Kim | Daily TrojanIn the clutch · The Trojans triumphed over the top-ranked Bruins on Saturday thanks to junior driver Blake Edward’s late go-ahead score.
Junior driver Blake Edwards scored the game-winning goal with 38 seconds to play to hand UCLA a surprising defeat and claim the top spot in the MPSF tournament for the Trojans.
Saturday’s seesaw affair saw four ties and four lead changes in the second half after USC led 4-3 at halftime. For most of the third quarter, both offensive efforts were thwarted until UCLA tied the game at 4-4. Junior driver Lazar Pasuljevic fired back with a long shot of his own that exploded past UCLA goalkeeper Garrett Danner. Then, the Bruins quickly seized the momentum, scoring two quick goals and entering the pivotal fourth frame riding a 6-5 lead. In need of a spark for his team, head coach Jovan Vavic provided that with an impassioned speech before play resumed in the final quarter.
“He just fired us up,” junior goalie McQuin Baron said. “He said this is our home pool, our crosstown rival.”
Vavic’s words must have motivated the Men of Troy, because soon after the break, senior diver Nick Bell tied the game up at 6-6 with the assist coming from a nifty no-look pass by Edwards.
“I just thought it was something I had to do,” said Bell. “The ball came to me at the right moment, and I knew I had to finish that opportunity and I stuck it.”
An intense five minutes of gridlock followed, with keepers Danner and Baron trading save after save. One Bruin shot looked like a sure goal with three minutes left, but Baron shifted to his side at the last second, deflecting on what was his most impressive stop.
Finally, Grant Stein put USC ahead 7-6 with just under three minutes to go, but the Bruins’ Chancellor Ramirez managed to find the back of the net with a little over a minute left. With the game even at 7-7 with a minute left, Edwards provided the winner. At the top of the formation, Edwards launched a screamer that landed into the corner of the net. Uytengsu became unglued as Baron made the game’s final save with 15 seconds left.
“We finally beat them,” Baron said, reflecting on his immediate thoughts after the win.
“It’s gotta be the best feeling ever,” Bell said. “I told the boys, ‘I want this bad.’ Last time UCLA played us, we ended up losing to them by four goals, so beating them today like this was an amazing feeling.”
A superb win for sure to break their streak. It still comes down to the final four for winning the national title
which is what really counts, and most likely the Trojans will have to beat them once again along the way.

If the college football season started Oct. 1, USC would be a shoo-in for the college football playoff and redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold would be the most formidable contender to Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson for the Heisman trophy.
Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately for the Trojan nation — and fortunately for every other team — the season starts in September.  Regardless of this year’s postseason awards though, the rest of the nation should be on alert: A rhsllen power is rising once again.
The Trojans’ dominant 26-13 victory over the previously unbeaten fourth-ranked Washington Huskies announced to the world that the Trojans of old are back. Much like the days of Pete Carroll, this is another Trojan team that no one — outside of maybe Alabama — would want to face come bowl season.
Great teams do what the Trojans did on Saturday. They go into hostile territory against equally talented foes, and out-scheme and out-play them. Some might point to the perfectly executed two-minute clinic that Darnold put on to give the Trojans a 17-6 lead heading into half, but the game was over way before then.
On Washington’s third play from scrimmage, they ran a reverse, a play that previously this year has killed the Trojan defense. The ball carrier for the Huskies was John Ross, quite possibly the fastest player in college football. In open space, junior hybrid linebacker-defensive end Uchenna Nwosu was tasked with making a solo tackle. Outside of maybe the SEC, linebackers and linemen are not supposed to have the speed and agility to make these kinds of plays. Yet there was Nwosu, knifing through the offensive line to bring Ross down for an 8-yard loss.
With that emphatic tackle for loss, the tone was set. The great USC defenses of the 21st century haven’t allowed teams to get outside. Any time an offense tried to go east or west, the Trojans were there in droves to snuff it out behind the line of scrimmage. That was the case on Saturday for running back Myles Gaskin and the rest of the Huskies backfield. Combine that with the immense pressure the USC front seven was able to generate on quarterback Jake Browning, and it is clear the Trojans’ immense defensive talent is developing before our eyes.
As was evident in the Huskies’ matchup against Utah, when Browning gets pressured, his poise and presence evaporates into erratic and off-target throws. The same could not be said of Darnold, who proved on Saturday he is the class of the Pac-12 and probably the nation.
Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson and Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson may be a bit faster, but I honestly believe Darnold is a better quarterback than both of them right now. Outside of his one misguided interception, Darnold was practically flawless throughout the night. He had two or three errant throws, but the rest of his incompletions were either drops or throw away passes and his second interception was because of a slip. In addition, Darnold proved that his two-minute drill offense is the best in the country. USC has now scored a touchdown or field goal every time they have had a chance in the final two minutes of the first half since Darnold took over.
Not only did he create extra time with his feet inside the pocket, but on his called-back touchdown run, Darnold also bowled over helpless defenders like they were still in high school. The reason the offense is running on all cylinders now is because those third and medium plays that were so hard to convert with Kessler, and — in a limited sample size — Browne, are easy with Darnold. In addition to the threat of the run, his ability to throw over the middle is better than that of Mark Sanchez, who was the last Trojan quarterback with that crucial skill.
Darnold has the arm strength and vision that USC hasn’t had at quarterback in years, and he is getting better each week. Darnold isn’t the only reason to be bullish on the Trojans’ offense. Sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett turned in another excellent performance, and redshirt freshman tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe might be the best pass catching tight end the Trojans have had since Mackey Award winner Fred Davis. The team will certainly miss the contributions of senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers and junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (if he turns pro), but freshman Michael Pittman and others are ready to step in and pick up the slack.
While there were many outstanding contributions, the best part about this Trojan victory was that it was not perfect. For the first time in forever, USC faced adversity and they did not wilt and wither away. When Darnold threw his second interception and Washington had the ball in field goal range, I had flashbacks to Utah earlier this year and Stanford in the conference title game last year as well as countless other games The Trojans have faltered in the last half decade.
After the turnover, the team played stout defense and sophomore defensive tackle Rasheem Green made a marvelous play on the blocked field goal, one of many on the night for a budding star. The Trojans picked up the ball and marched down the field. They were almost stymied once again with a damaging 15-yard penalty in the red zone, but the team was not to be denied the end zone, finding a way to score after staring at first and goal from the 24-yard line.
Overall, the Trojans dominated the Huskies, and what is even more impressive is that the Trojans could have been even better. The rest of the Pac-12 must be very concerned right about now, because USC is finally back and head coach Clay Helton deserves all the credit.
I was immensely critical of him after the start to the season — not because of scheme particularly but because of the conservative approach he took early on. He has completely shed that persona and his newly found gunslinger mentality bodes well for the team. His decision to go for it on fourth and one with two minutes left was brilliant. Though the actual play call was lacking, rolling Darnold out should be the default play on any critical short yardage conversion, his aggressiveness and faith in his offense speaks to his growth and development as a coach.
It is a shame the season didn’t start Oct. 1, but with some lucky losses from Utah and Colorado, the Trojans still have the chance to win the Pac-12 and a Rose Bowl. It may not be the playoff, but ending an eight-year drought would be a great start to a new era. With Darnold at the helm, anything is possible.

On Tuesday night, as the polling numbers from state after state rolled in, it was as if a curtain was — slowly, horrifyingly — being drawn back across the body of the United States. To the marginalized people witnessing the final hours of the presidential election, it was defeating to realize that underneath this curtain was their country’s true form. When the presidency was called around midnight, one of the more harrowing realizations in a cacophony of emotions was that Donald Trump’s victory had been decided long before Nov. 8. Even despite the last few weeks when everything seemed poised for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s victory, Election Night was a reminder that potent and reactive hatred had been rooted in America long before the curtain was drawn.
Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
White people elected Trump. Not all white people, but most of them. It bodes well to consider that these white men and women may not have supported everything he said, but still they supported the man who said it.
As the shock of Trump’s victory begins to wear off — for Democrats, Republicans and the presidential candidates themselves — a new wave of reaction has followed the initial devastating outcry. Thrown off by the tangible grief expressed by the marginalized people around them, many whites have tried to distance themselves from this outpouring of devastation and true fear. They tell these marginalized people that they, or others like them, voted for Trump despite his bigotry, not because of it. They tell these people to stop overreacting, stop whining. They tell them that not all whites are racist, that all sides need to be sympathetic to the others’ opinions.
For perhaps the first time in their lives, many whites are feeling their own race. Feeling their race when they walk into a class filled with minorities, when they walk by the demonstrations on campus at Tommy Trojan. They want to reassure their classmates that they played no part in ripping down American democracy, that furthermore, their feelings and sensitivities matter as well. This is understandable. A sizable portion of the white population did not vote for Trump, and this number is certainly larger on a college campus. Nevertheless, reminiscent of the #NotAllMen campaign, this new vein of reactive criticism comes from those in a position of extreme and subconscious privilege.
Trump was elected on the woes of white men, but it is everyone else who must endure the fallout. It is not the duty for oppressed individuals to tend to the delicate ego of white America. To reassure them, the day after everything changed, that they are good people.
Before Nov. 8, white Trump voters swallowed their morals to elect to the presidency a man whose litany of bad behavior is endless. They either feared progress or decided they would be fine without it, and yet, the day after the election, they and the people they know criticize marginalized people for the overwhelming response of grief and fear. The appeal to not be deemed racist, the need to remind marginalized people of the complex reasons many supported Donald Trump, is particularly ironic given the label of “oversensitivity” they associate with liberals and people of color.
When white Americans do not try to understand the suffering of marginalized people, they accuse them of being too easily hurt. But when the spotlight is shone on their faces, whites must suddenly remind their peers that their opinions should not be assumed based on race. They equate their hurt feelings with the devastating new realities marginalized people face for themselves and their families.
Global history has proved that the sufferings of minorities matter less than the actions and feelings of whites. It is the habit of the privileged group to equate every perceived insult with their own oppression. Because they are encouraged not to spew racial hatred, they are oppressed by the infringement of “political correctness” on their freedom of speech. Because the day after the most divisive election in U.S. history, they suddenly feel self-conscious about their race, they appeal to people of color not to jump to conclusions that they voted for Trump or voted for him because they were racist.
There are many who will read this article and react with claims of racism. But remember that racism is a systemic and institutionalized phenomenon. One does not experience systemic racism if one has benefited from the system since the birth of this country.
So, in these raw days after Nov. 8, when many fear that they and their families will be deported, that their families will not be allowed to enter the country, that their sexual orientation will not be recognized, that control over their bodies will be taken away, please don’t play the victim. For once in the entire bloody, colonial existence of American democracy, let marginalized people feel their grief. Let them express their anger. Let them.
For 17 months — and practically a lifetime — Trump has showed the country who he is. He, if stretched to his thinnest, can erupt in a cascade of hatred and bigotry. The fear of marginalized Americans is justified and real.
To the white students of USC: Do not tell friends of color, women friends, Muslim friends, LGBT friends, disabled friends, that they are overreacting. Do not tell them to stop whining. Do not tell them that everything will be OK because the nation knows that this may not be true. And if one doesn’t have friends like these, perhaps it is time to make some. If marginalized people need to open their minds to examine why white America voted for Trump, then it is only right for white America to try to understand why these people are so angry and so very afraid.
 
Ironically, the hysteria enmeshed in this article is what drove the pushback for Trump to being elected. The same safe space, self-entitled, White people-hating, heterosexual people hating, people created such a glut of ridiculous positions, we finally had sane-minded people saying “enough”. I know plenty of people who voted for Trump and to summarily say they are racist is silly and childish, if not offensive. It is also incredible to assume no Latinos, Muslims, women, etc voted for Trump! Again, please remain in your liberal academic social bubble and please continue to be shrill, loud and proud. It will only galvanize the sane people to know what they should push back on.
On the other hand, Juanita Broaddrick says that, for the first time in 38 years, she is not afraid. Let’s have some empathy, please.
“Election Night was a reminder that potent and reactive hatred had been rooted in America long before the curtain was drawn.”
What? How can you even substantiate such a baseless claim?
“White people elected Trump. Not all white people, but most of them. It bodes well to consider that these white men and women may not have supported everything he said, but still they supported the man who said it.”
Well yes, around 54% did. But 85% of non college educated blacks voted for Hillary and many more whites voted for Obama than Mitt Romney. Not to mention Trump did better with minorities than Clinton, 34% Latino and 8% of the Black vote. He beat both Romney and Clinton there. And what of those who supported Clinton? They may not have supported her illegal actions with an email server and the obvious pay to play scheme she ran which was apparent in her emails, but they still the supported the women. Such a blanket statement lacking any rational backing.
“They tell them that not all whites are racist, that all sides need to be sympathetic to the others’ opinions.”
Is this not the basis of Free Speech and Democracy?
“For perhaps the first time in their lives, many whites are feeling their own race. Feeling their race when they walk into a class filled with minorities, when they walk by the demonstrations on campus at Tommy Trojan. They want to reassure their classmates that they played no part in ripping down American democracy, that furthermore, their feelings and sensitivities matter as well. ”
So what I read here is, White people realize they are white. But lets play the who is a bigger victim card. Get Real. I for one have no qualms with people being proud of who they are. If you are white, be proud you are who you are. If you hate the color of your own skin or somehow feel guilty for it then that is depressive and a regressive attitude.
“Trump was elected on the woes of white men, but it is everyone else who must endure the fallout. It is not the duty for oppressed individuals to tend to the delicate ego of white America. To reassure them, the day after everything changed, that they are good people.”
Point already disproven. And your assumption that groups in the United States are, what I can only assume is “Institutionalized Oppression” is baseless.
“There are many who will read this article and react with claims of racism. But remember that racism is a systemic and institutionalized phenomenon. One does not experience systemic racism if one has benefited from the system since the birth of this country.”
Institutionalized……..hmmmm. So that means that if I go to Zimbabwe, where Black Supremacists currently hold power in government and I begin to use derogatory language when referring to Blacks like N*gg*r I am not being racist? Currently by your model I am not because in Zimbabwe I hold no institutionalized power to position my thoughts by force. This whole paragraph has been disproven by many a mind greater than mine. And the idea of racism being “systemic and insitutionalized” is tantamount to chasing ghosts.
The fact that such an article that could be consider race baiting as it has an over arching tone of blaming white people for the election of a President who won the election fair and square by the means that the founding fathers intended was even published makes me question not only the sanity of the Editors, but the kind of climate the Campus Administration is trying to promote. Is it hostility and an attempt to credence to the new idea that the new left is “Anti-White” or is being inclusive? I believe it is the former.
After he got elected, he’s acted nothing but civil. I abhor the things he said while he was running and I’m no fan of the President-Elect but you gotta give it to him – he’s acting more mature than a lot of liberals right now who can’t take the loss. The conservatives have been patiently waiting eight years for our turn to try new things. Yeah, we complain but so do you. You need to get your head out of your liberal, self-righteous cloud and start looking objectively! Give him a chance. If he does something stupid, we’ll impeach the bastard.
You are overreacting.
You have no idea how our federal government operates, do you?

Since Donald Trump’s election Tuesday, demonstrations and protests have been sustained throughout Los Angeles. Thousands, including USC students, have marched to City Hall, filled the lawn of MacArthur Park and even poured into streets and freeways. Throughout the city, the cries are familiar —”Not my president!” resounds from Trousdale Parkway to Main Street.
Social media has become a space for users to both broadcast protest and denounce it. Despite my political leaning, I have friends on social media who occupy the entire political spectrum. A quick scroll through my Facebook newsfeed will show one friend posting a video in front of City Hall, another friend calling anti-Trump protesters “whiners.”
Although my political loyalty lies with the friend with the sign and megaphone in hand, I have endeavored, throughout this election, to hear the friend who supports Trump. I find, however, the rhetoric of “unity” and the “anti-whining” campaign many Trump supporters have adopted, in response to protests, frankly disturbing. This rhetoric and campaign function as silencing tactics that readily disregard the rights of protestors and ignores palpable violence happening across the country.
The purveyors of this narrative, which seeks to silence discontent, fail to recognize the impetus behind the protests. People are not merely protesting because they dislike Donald Trump. Many are protesting because they fear for their lives and safety. The Southern Poverty Law Center has reported more than 200 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation since Election Day. These attacks — many of which have included direct references to the Trump campaign — have particularly victimized women, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community.
One report came from an black woman in Louisiana who was harassed by a group of white men while waiting at a red light to cross the street. One of the men in the passing truck yelled, “F-ck your black life!” Meanwhile, the others laughed, and one eventually began chanting “Trump!” as they drove away.
When I read stories such as this one, I wonder if the average Trump supporter who has criticized the recent protests would tell the Muslim woman whose hijab was pulled off her head to “stop whining.” I wonder if they would tell the Latino boy handed a fake deportation letter from one of his classmates to “stop whining.” I wonder if they would tell my black classmates called the N-word last week to “stop whining.” The hundreds of incidents that have occurred since Tuesday illustrate that people are outraged for good reason. A group of protestors inevitably includes people whose lives are being threatened by those emboldened by Trump’s campaign rhetoric.
With knowledge of the hateful incidents growing in number across the United States, responsibility falls on everyone to speak out. Speaking out does not just look like protesting. You can constructively engage with friends on social media, talk to your representatives, sign a petition or remain vigilant and report hateful attacks. Now is the time for solidarity, not silence. When we tell people to be silent, we allow violence to continue.

Amanda West | Daily TrojanMorgan Andrews helped the Women of Troy advance in the NCAA tournament with a win over Eastern Washington on Sunday.
As the final seconds ticked down before kick-off against the Eastern Washington Eagles on Saturday, senior Morgan Andrews danced across midfield.
The midfielder twisted and hopped in place to “Shout!” by The Isley Brothers as it blasted through the loudspeakers, pointing at her frontline and earning laughs from the whole team. The players looked relaxed, more like a team about to start a scrimmage than one about to kick off the first game of the NCAA tournament.
But then the whistle blew, the first kick sent the ball into the attacking half of the field and Andrews proved why the Trojans have the confidence to dance their way far into this year’s tourney. In a 3-1 victory over Eastern Washington, the Trojans advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament.
The first goal for the Trojans wasn’t the prettiest, but it threw the team into an offensive that drove the rest of the game. In the 29th minute, Andrews rocketed a shot straight at Eagles keeper Mallory Taylor. The ball ricocheted off her gloves and across the goal line. Taylor scrambled to gather up the ball, but the sideline ref thrust his flag high, signalling that the ball went just far enough to tally a goal.
Senior midfielder Savannah Levin followed minutes later, slicing through defenders in the box toward the right post before she was sent sprawling by a defender. Andrews stepped up to take the penalty kick that followed. She shimmied, sent Taylor shuffling to the right and then buried her shot in the left side of the net.
Within minutes, the Trojans had taken a 2-0 lead. From that point on, it was damage control for Eastern Washington as the USC pounded their backline. Junior Nicole Molen finished the half with a perfect touch on a header to send the ball into the right netting with a minute left to play, and the Trojans entered the half with a 3-0 lead and all the momentum on their side.
There’s a difference between playing confident and playing casual, and that became clear for the Trojans in the second half. In the 59th minute, the Eagles slipped a header past keeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme’s gloves, chipping away at the lead.
“I think sometimes we get too casual, which can hurt us,” Prudhomme said. “We just need to keep going patiently and keep passing and making the right decisions. We can’t relax too much.”
It didn’t take much to make the momentum waver. Though USC retained possession and continued to pressure in their attacking third, Eastern Washington launched dangerous counterattack drives. And a blocked penalty kick following a second foul in the box on Levin spurred the Eagles onto their feet.
But pressure from defenders Mandy Freeman and Ally Prisock kept the Trojans in control. The team took 35 shots and put 17 on frame, forcing 13 saves from Taylor. And a tightening of the defense after allowing a goal meant that Prudhomme only had to make three saves.
The Eagles kept offensive pressure until the very end, lofting a shot that Prudhomme caught easily, ending the game with the ball in her hands. The victory advanced the Trojans onto the second round of the NCAA championship. The team will take on Texas A&M next week, and head coach Keidane McAlpine feels that his squad is ready to go the distance in the tourney.
“There’s no easy game at this point,” McAlpine said. “It’s just a matter of preparation at this point. I thought it was a good first win. A good way to start the tournament.”

The USC Thornton Chamber Orchestra performed an all-Ludwig van Beethoven program Friday night in Bovard Auditorium. The concert consisted of select symphonic works including “Trio for 2 Oboes & English horn,” “Op. 87, Finale: Presto,” “Coriolan Overture,” “Symphony No. 5, Op. 67” and “Overture from Egmont,” three songs for voice and piano trio and three works for trombone choir “3 Equali for Four Trombones.” Principal conductor Carl St. Clair led the evening’s performance.
Opening the concert, oboists Laura Arganbright, Bhavani Kotha and English horn Marissa Honda performed Beethoven’s “Trio for 2 Oboes & English Horn in C Major.” Hours of practice and rehearsal culminated in a detailed and well-executed performance. The trio composition echoed the styling of many pieces performed. While all by Beethoven, the pieces had compositional characteristics that would suggest otherwise to a casual listener.
Chad Lonski | Daily TrojanA Night of Beethoven · The Thornton Chamber Orchestra performed some of Beethoven’s standard and lesser-known works Friday night in Bovard Auditorium. Conductor Carl St. Clair called it an “expedition.”
“How many of you would say that was Beethoven? I guarantee you not many hands should go up right now … [This trio] was written when he was a mere 21 years old — he was under the influence of Mozart. The first movement of this trio, definitely Mozart, the adagio, definitely Beethoven, the last movement much more influenced by Joseph Haydn,” St. Clair said. “This [concert] was my way of welcoming you to a Beethoven expedition where we are going to have a chance to look at various aspects of Beethoven’s life.”
Digging further into the lesser-known corners of Beethoven’s composing career, a trio with Somang Jaegal on piano, Hanbyul Jang on violin and Benjamin Lash on cello performed alongside vocalists in three of Beethoven’s lesser-known songs. Matt Hough performed “The Pulse of an Irishman,” Irena Preda played “His Boat Comes on the Sunny Tide,” Zhengyi Bai took on “Put Round the Bright Wine,” and collectively they performed “Come Fill, Fill, My Good Fellow.” Beethoven, not widely known for vocal works, was justly represented by the vocalists.
The orchestra put on Beethoven’s well-known “Egmont Overture” with great musicianship. The musicians were able to blend and balance instruments as well as phrases in the piece, handling every challenging passage thrown at them. The same level of skill was noticeable in the performance of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony. The orchestra performed with intricate handling of the piece’s intonation. St. Clair’s leadership of the orchestra was equally as commendable, his excitement and embodiment for the piece was apparent on the podium, his feet never planted closer than a foot apart, transforming into a dynamic reflection of the orchestra.
Performed by nine trombones, and led by professor of trombone chair Terry Cravens, “3 Equali for Four Trombones” was perhaps the least expected piece of the evening. An equali is a short choral type composition usually written for religious processions and funeral services. The three in the concert were composed by Beethoven in 1812, St. Clair explained.
“Two of the three Equali were performed at the funeral procession of Ludwig von Beethoven. When you hear the sound of trombones, in the theological way of thinking, you are hearing a divine being,” St. Clair said.
The trombonists were able to perform the delicate piece with great care balancing the power of the instrument with the delicacy of the piece, meeting all of the chords and lyrical progressions with great accuracy.
Unlike “Overture from Egmont” and “Symphony No. 5,” which have been staples in concert programs for centuries, it was an eye-opening experience to explore the deeper lesser-known history of Beethoven’s composition anthology. St. Clair’s dedication not only as a conductor and musician, but also as an educator, is apparent in his explanation of the pieces making the concert as much of a cultural survey as it was an orchestral performance.

When the first shot of Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk filled the screen, the audience emitted an audible gasp. It was an ordinary scene, certainly — a young man simply wakes up and turns his phone alarm off. But it was, to this date, the most realistic visual modern moviegoers will have experienced in their lifetimes. Director Ang Lee and director of photography John Toll shot the entire film like this, with 120 frames per second — heightening the crystal clarity of the picture to electrifying levels. This effect, combined with 3-D, gives the movie and eerie sense of utter reality. In this regard, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk is a true innovation.
Photo from Sony PicturesHomecoming · Featuring newcomer Joe Alwyn, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk explores a young man’s reality of returning home from Iraq. The film, shot in 120 frames per second, offers heightened realism, as the sharper images allow audience members to have an immersive experience.
Set in just one day, the film follows Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn), a 19-year-old soldier currently in the middle of a tour through America celebrating the success of his Bravo Squad. Thanks to a video of him that went viral, Billy is lauded as the squad’s star hero for rushing to the aid of the now-deceased Sergeant Shroom. Now in Texas, Bravo Squad is set to participate in a football game’s halftime show along with musical act Destiny’s Child. But the day — filled with activity like meeting cheerleaders, getting footballs signed and watching the game  — is punctured by Billy’s flashbacks of his time in Iraq and returning home to a working-class family. And laced throughout the football game is a love story, a movie deal about the Bravo Squad and a choice Billy ultimately has to make: Will he return to Iraq again?
It is perhaps ironic that in a movie where each visual is finely tuned to look as real as possible, the true realism of the story lies with Joe Alwyn, who plays Billy. A new face in cinema, Alwyn imbues his role with both youthful naivete and suppressed distraught. Perhaps because Alwyn is not (yet) a star, it is easy for the audience to see him as only Billy, and the loss of Shroom — who before an Iraq battle tells each member of his squad that he loves them — is something that Billy internalizes deeply. Despite being present at Shroom’s death, Billy knows that he could return to Iraq, and he cries when he listens to the National Anthem in the football stadium. With this, the audience can only begin to understand what Billy is feeling: mourning for a lost brother and intense love for America that somehow fuse into one.
Photo from Tristar PicturesHalftime show · Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk was directed by Academy Award-winning Ang Lee, who is known for Brokeback Mountain and Life of Pi. This is his first film shot in 120 frames per second.
For all its worth, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk is a film of extraordinary magnitude. It is an endeavor the filmmakers knew they were undertaking — with the use of 120 frames per second, the story elements of the film would have to rise to the challenge presented by the visuals. This is where the movie ultimately fails. The emotional realism is conveyed through Alwyn’s heart-wrenching performance, but the film becomes almost too pointed in the several subplots it weaves throughout. Without the love story and the movie deal, the film could have been enough in portraying how difficult it is to return home from war, to be looked at by civilians all the wrong ways. Instead, Billy and Faison (Makenzie Leigh) stumble through an unbelievably short-lived relationship; Billy listens to Hollywood players explain to him how little the industry values his story. These scenes take away from the heart of the film instead of adding to it. It is disappointing that Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk tries as hard with its story as it does with its visuals; everything feels awkward because of it.
Based on a novel of the same name by Ben Fountain, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk is a pioneering effort in cinema realism, yet is ultimately set back by a stilted storyline and unnecessary subplots.

Two teams of USC students have made it to the finals of Adobe’s 15th annual Analytics Challenge, a business and technology competition open to university students from across the country.
This year’s teams consist of first-year Master’s in Business Administration students Edward Cho, Mary Qin and Mrinal Trikha, who make up Team DataInsights, and Naman Gupta, Kathryn Lin and Seerut Sidhu, who call themselves Team Adobe Task Force.
Team DataInsights said that they assembled their team after realizing that they had similar interests and skills, specifically focusing on digital marketing competition along with data analytics. They felt as if they could fill in the gaps that the other teams possessed.
“We all love data analytics, and there are so many insights that we have gained,” Cho said. “I personally have learned so much about customer-level data analytics. Big data in marketing gives really big opportunities for companies to capitalize on.”
Adobe started the Analytics Challenge to recognize the importance of analyzing data, as the competition seeks to close the data skills gap and nurture the next wave of tech leaders. This year’s sponsor, Sony, will provide $50,000 in total prizes to the top six teams, with first place receiving $30,000.
Participants have the opportunity to utilize their skills to analyze data from the real world offered by Sony’s PlayStation app and Playstation.com. This offered competitors access to information on site traffic, visitor retention and conversion, in-app user action metrics, device information and average session length. Students are tasked with analyzing the user experience, conversion rates and “stickiness” in order to provide Sony with recommendations for optimization.
Qin said that her team’s strategy focused on combining all of their individual talents to analyze the data and look for patterns.
“We had to figure out the relationships between the sets of data,” Qin said. “When we came up with the initial plan, we tried many different approaches and then finally narrowed it down to the one we presented and kept winning. Hopefully we will continue to do so.”
Trikha added that perseverance helped the team get to the final round of the competition.
“Sometimes you are hoping for some things out of the data, but you don’t always get that,” Trikha said. “Through this process, I have learned that you have to provide recommendations that are actually impactful. It is so important, because through this information we can predict future patterns, and it will become so much easier to collect information and store it with advancing technology.”
Members of Team Adobe Task Force, meanwhile, said that though it has been difficult working with only three people, they have been able to learn from their peers and develop their own skills over time.
“It’s great exposure to actually use the software,” Lin said. “We are able to use information to create a better experience for customers, but also increased revenue for the company.”
Gupta expressed gratitude to the competition for providing him the opportunity to engage in an activity that will help him with his future career in the technology field.
“The competition has been going on for over a month now, so our time-management skills have improved drastically since we have had to balance this with midterms, finals and other schoolwork,” Gupta said.
The finals of the competition will take place on Nov. 18 at the Adobe campus in Lehi, Utah. The two USC teams are competing against teams from Yale University, Brigham Young University, the University of Utah and the University of California, Los Angeles.
Team Adobe Task Force has done a good job, I appreciate it
