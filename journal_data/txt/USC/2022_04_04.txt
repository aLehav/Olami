The first time Heidi Atlas heard the news about School of Cinematic Arts Internship Coordinator Joe Brukner’s termination was from her mother.
Atlas, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, received a low-resolution screenshot of an unofficial SCA Facebook group post, which read, “My daughter … has learned that they are losing the SCA internship coordinator for next year because the position is being eliminated and the coordinator terminated as a result … Has anyone else heard about this?”
The Internship Program office — a subset of SCA’s Industry Relations run by Brukner and two student workers — offers an online database of available internships, known as the SCA Job Board, as well as one-on-one advising appointments, workshops and career events. Brukner’s contract expired Thursday and was not renewed.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, SCA said Brukner’s position was a “one-year fixed position that was set to conclude on March 31, 2022,” and that the school “will continue to provide students with information about internship opportunities through the SCA’s Office of Industry Relations.” 
Cami Smith-Dahl, one of the Internship Program’s student workers, said Brukner was a “great benefit to the program.”
“[Before Brukner, SCA students] would get emails every two weeks …and every email would have 10 to 20 internships,” said Smith-Dahl, a sophomore majoring in film and television production. 
When Brukner joined, Smith-Dahl said he expanded the Job Board — created by the previous internship coordinator, Caroline Fraissinet — to be over 167 pages long.
Smith-Dahl said that as of last Monday — three days before Brukner’s termination — she had not received official communication as to how Brukner’s responsibilities would be delegated following his leave. According to an SCA statement released to the Daily Trojan Monday, students received communication on Friday about “servicing of internship opportunities moving forward.” Lisa Fox, Director of First Jobs at SCA, would “be overseeing and advising on internship opportunities.”
“He’s assured me that I will [still be working there],” she said. “But a lot of the details are still very unknown. Even [on Monday], I was talking to him during my shift about who’s going to be checking the email … for when students have questions and when companies need to communicate with us about postings, and he was like, ‘Yeah, we still don’t know who’s going to do that.’”
Atlas said she believes Brukner’s termination was part of a larger culture of elitism and marginalization at SCA.
“This change will disproportionately affect people who happen to be low-income [or] people of color,” Atlas said. “Despite all this talk about inclusivity and diversity, [SCA doesn’t] really practice what they preach … SCA doesn’t give a fuck about us. So we’re not going to just sit here and take it quietly.”
Atlas reached out to Gabriella Diaz, an SCA Undergraduate Production Council representative, asking if Diaz could “do anything about this.” Diaz said she reached out to schedule meetings with some of the production chairs at SCA, which were postponed due to scheduling conflicts. Unable to speak with administration, Diaz — along with Atlas and Smith-Dahl — started a Change.org petition to reinstate Brukner. 
“We feel like we have no power over our education at this point,” Diaz said. “We can’t talk to anyone … without making a big stink about it.”
Within the first 24 hours of its release, the petition garnered more than 400 signatures. At the time of publication, 675 people have now signed.
“It’s also just interesting that the three of us were all women of color,” Atlas said. “We’re the ones who had to carry this burden of trying to save a resource that is for people like us.”
Diaz said that without Brukner, attending SCA would “be a waste of time.”
“He’s the only one in SCA that I can say that has the most communication with students,” she said. “Just the way that he’s able to respond so quickly, and set up so many things to help us out, is instrumental in helping people like me who have no connections.” 
Diaz forwarded the petition to SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley, writing that Brukner’s termination would disproportionately affect minority students, and that it was “unprofessional and insulting” to remove Brukner on such short notice. A response on behalf of Daley arrived Wednesday, inviting her to a closed-door discussion about the internship coordinator that will take place Monday.
Diaz said she hopes for “a rehire or a reconsideration of reinstating the Internship Coordinator position.”
“Ideally, we get [Brukner] back, because we all love [Brukner],” Diaz said. “But, realistically, based on the short timeline that they’ve hidden behind closed doors, those are the best things we can hope for.”
Brukner declined to comment regarding his termination.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Joe Brunker, created the original internship document. The previous internship coordinator, Caroline Fraissinet, created the document. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Holding a framed photograph of her late father, Carolyn Sugiyama Classen received, on his behalf, an apology and degree from USC that she thought would never come. 
Her father, Francis Sueo Sugiyama, was a dental student at the University when President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 following Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The order would require the internment of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, including Sugiyama and 120 other first-generation Japanese American, or Nisei, students. 
After World War II concluded and internment camps closed, then-University President Rufus B. von KleinSmid refused to readmit previously enrolled Nisei students to the University and denied the students their transcripts, which would allow them to transfer their credits to other universities. 
So, when a friend sent her a USC News article that outlined the University’s plans to award the Nisei students their honorary degrees posthumously, Sugiyama Classen said she was “in shock.” 
“I didn’t think USC would ever make up for what they did to my father,” said Sugiyama Classen in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
President Carol Folt, along with Provost Charles Zukoski and USC Board of Trustees voting member Rod Nakamoto, conferred posthumous honorary degrees on 33 Nisei students, including Sugiyama, at the Asian Pacific Alumni Association gala in Pasadena Friday. Members of the students’ families received the degrees. 
In 2012, the University announced that it would award honorary degrees to living Nisei students, because of an existing policy against posthumous degrees — a policy Folt said making a “simple exception to” was “the greatest privilege that you can imagine.” 
“We’re bringing some closure, and perhaps healing, more than 80 years after this injustice began,” said Folt at the gala. 
Sugiyama Classen said receiving her father’s posthumous degree was “a good way to lay [the situation] to rest.” 
“I just want to close the chapter. It’s been 80 years since the Executive Order was signed,” she said. “It’s time to close the chapter for our family.” 
For Lawrence Fujioka, whose father, John Masato Fujioka, was a first-year dental student when he was forced to leave USC for an internment camp at Santa Anita Racetrack, the honorary degree conferral was “a great thing.” 
“I can only guess that [my father] would be really happy about it,” said Fujioka in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “For him, this honorary degree just is a sign that USC recognizes the error they made in not releasing those transcripts. And I think the most meaningful part is the apology.” 
Earlier in the day, the University dedicated a newly built rock garden to the Nisei students. The garden, officially named the Tribute Rock Garden for Nisei Students, is located near the Amy King Dundon-Berchtold University Club. It is designed in the style of karesansui, or traditional Japanese dry garden. 
“Our own karesansui is designed for meditation and contemplation and expresses the resilience, the perseverance and the hope of our USC Nisei students who faced tremendous suffering and injustice,” said Folt at the garden’s dedication. “We must never forget what happened in those internment camps, and indeed, across our society at that time, because memory is one of the primary deterrents to repeating injustice.” 
The perseverance of the Nisei students is represented by a Japanese proverb translating to “on a stone for three years” inscribed in Japanese kanji on a large vertical stone near the garden’s entrance, Folt said. 
“This proverb teaches that even when we experience hard times, through our endurance and patience, we will overcome,” she said. 
For landscape architect Calvin Abe, whose parents were also interned, designing the garden was a “unique and spiritual journey.” 
“To me, certainly it’s a garden of perseverance, but it speaks to the human spirit,” said Abe in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Even though it’s dedicated to the Nisei, it speaks to this country, to all people.” 
Fujioka’s son, Bob, also spoke at the garden’s dedication, expressing his family’s gratitude for Folt and the University’s actions. 
“On behalf of my late father and all the other families of Nisei students, I would like to express our sincere and deepest gratitude for your having the vision, the courage and the respect for our ancestors to bring about such a historic exception to a long-standing school policy,” he said. “While this rock garden has been built as a tribute to the Nisei, it is truly meant for the living. And that is what the Nisei would want it to be.” 
Folt will also honor the Nisei students at the 2022 Commencement in May, where she will “recognize and salute these degree recipients before the entire University community.”
Correction: A previous version of this article mistakenly named John Masato Fujioka as John Masao Fujioka. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The hallmark of a great artist is the ability to directly connect the past with the present. One of the leading artists exhibiting such a connection today is Ferjo.
Born Fernando de Jesus Oliveira in 1946, the Brazilian artist has become a leading figure in the modern American art scene through his unique art style. 
Ferjo takes inspiration from great masters of the past, such as Vermeer, Van Gogh, Renoir, Picasso, Dali, Miro, Da Vinci and Michelangelo. His style combines cubism, abstract expressionism, realism and surrealism. Ferjo directly recreates pre-existing artwork in his own paintings, highlighting his understanding of the past. Rather than completely departing from old techniques in favor of new styles, he continues to mold painting in a new way by combining the old with the new. 
In “Persistence of Time with Miro,” Ferjo’s eclectic style is revealed through his references to Dali and Miro. Dali’s painting, “The Persistence of Memory,”is fully recreated in the center of the painting. The surrounding artwork depicted is stylistically similar to those of Miro, fully paying homage to the Abstract Expressionism movement. 
In addition to directly recreating past artwork, Ferjo adds his own touch by creating a new space altogether in which the other artwork is present. The room depicted in the painting feels like a snapshot of a much larger space, creating a double viewing effect: The audience sees a painting of a painting. This layering helps Ferjo draw the viewer in. 
Through Ferjo’s work, his viewer experiences a new relationship with the surreal, seeing its evolution from Dali and Miro to this piece. This feeling of spatial compression explains the revolutionary nature of Ferjo’s painting. 
From a stylistic standpoint, Ferjo’s ability to recreate artwork shows his versatility. However, the most crucial part of Ferjo’s work is an innate emotional connection formed between the viewer and the work.
Through his paintings, Ferjo depicts a whole new take on reverie. Looking at “Persistence of Time with Miro,” the viewer is already transported to an different other-worldly space, through the vibrant colors and out-of-place figures in the foreground. After further interaction, the audience is lost in Dali’s painting. 
As a singular entity, the painting seems to represent a much larger space, and the viewer wants to see beyond the edge of the canvas. There is something appealing about the idea of a world within worlds, and by connecting so many styles and artworks, Ferjo very clearly feeds on this paradox. However, the emotional appeal is effortless. 
It feels like peace.
Looking at the image, clearly other-worldly, I cannot help but feel a strange sense of calmness. Whether this is because of a universal truth at the core of this painting or the desire to find truth in this image, I cannot say. 
One of the beauties of abstract art is the instantaneous emotional reaction it evokes from the viewer. And this painting — an oscillation between complexity and simplicity — does a perfect job acting as a window for the viewer to stop and imagine something beyond the tangible world. 
Ultimately, the viewer leaves anxious and hungry to see more.
And that is what makes this painting is so brilliant. Beyond the physicality or meaning of the painting, the viewer is instantly attached to the art. This is because the core of all art, past or present, is purpose. For when there is purpose, there is emotion. And when there is emotion, there is understanding. 
Dali knew this. As well as Miro, Da Vinci, Michelangelo and all the rest, including Ferjo.

Trojan Pride triumphantly hosted Songfest for the first time since 2015 Saturday at Bovard Auditorium. One of the USC’s oldest traditions, Songfest started in 1954 as a judged fundraiser where student artists showcased their various talents and competed against each other while raising profits for Troy Camp, a student-run philanthropy organization that provides mentorship for students in South Los Angeles. 
Trojan Pride, USC’s official spirit organization, has worked to bring back Songfest, last attempting in 2018. Logan Barth, the organization’s co-executive director, said he believes Songfest is important for Trojan morale. 
“A big part of Trojan Pride is, obviously, increasing Trojan spirit across campus … we’re doing this to increase spirit on campus because USC’s traditions are a big part of student life here,” said Barth, a freshman majoring in law, history, and culture. “It is important to maintain them to keep that classic Trojan experience that students come here for.”
The night started out with Trojan Marching Band performing classics such as the “USC Fight Song,” and popular songs like “Bad Romance” by Lady Gaga. 
Following the Marching Band was all-male a cappella group the Trojan Men, who performed Sean Kingston’s “Beautiful Girls.” The crooning voice of their soloist Daniel Marable and the meshing of the song with the low tones of fellow soloist Sid Bajaj singing “Stand by Me” by Ben E. King were met with cheers from the audience from the opening note. 
“I really just wanted to do something related to singing that was more low pressure, just wanted some way, some kind of outlet to do some singing,” Trojan Men president Timothy Reilly said. “[Songfest] is an opportunity for guys to get together, sing music they like and have a fun time. It’s exciting to see all these groups on campus.”
Next on stage were two student performers from USComedians, Jonathan Krone, a senior majoring in narrative studies and Angelina Stroud, a senior majoring in journalism. Krone, a self-titled “alpha male,” made jokes about his experiences at USC. 
The third act was Spade A Dance, an energetic K-pop dance cover group performing “Feel My Rhythm” by Red Velvet and “JIKJIN” by TREASURE. 
The first song included a beautiful performance complete with fairy-like costumes to match the light-hearted track, while the second reflected a more intense and darker song. Carol Li, co-director of Spade A Dance, said the dance group enjoyed themselves while performing on stage. 
 “We always love performing at an opportunity like this,” Li said. “It’s not about showing off, but we have a chance to do what we want to do and then we can share the joy with everyone, not just the members of our team but also the people who love K-pop and who just love dancing in general.”
The USC Magic Association then mesmerized the audience as they performed a slew of impressive magic tricks. 
It was hard to tell what was more surprising to the crowd: new member John Hemmer catching a card chosen by Songfest judge Patrick Corbin in the air with chopsticks while blindfolded or the group correctly predicting an audience member would chose “Avatar: The Last Airbender” as their favorite show. 
“I love the way that people react to magic,” said Tyler Gibgot. “I’ve just realized that it’s a great way to bring people together. You know, no matter your age, race, gender or background, I feel like magic is like a universal language, and that’s why I love it.”
The harmonies of the next performance, Mariachi SC, filled the audience’s soul and elevated their spirits as they saw the musicians engulfed in the music. 
The show then proceeded to bring up the Sirens, an a cappella group, who sang “Killing Me Softly With His Song” by Fugees and “Bang Bang” by Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj. During their performance of “Bang Bang,” three soloists matched the original singers, even performing the rap portions of the songs.
The only Doo-wop group on campus, the Trousdales, made their debut performance, bringing the audience back to the ‘50s when Songfest first originated. Concluding the show was the Belly Dance Club, which captivated the audience with their vivacious moves.
At the end of the show, Corbin, who judged the show, deemed Mariachi SC had the best performance. Spade A Dance was also voted as the Trojan Choice winner by audience members. 
“We were extraordinarily happy with the way Songfest turned out,” Barth said. “It really set us up to bring back this event, keep it a tradition at USC and make sure it doesn’t go away. We thought the performers did an incredible job and that the audience had fun.”
Correction: In a previous version of this article, we incorrectly attributed the photograph to Tara Mojtahedzadeh. The photo is now correctly attributed to Brianna Tang. It was also incorrectly stated that Tyler Gibgot was the president of the USC Magic Association. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Two years after the release of the critically acclaimed “Fine Line,” Harry Styles returns with “As It Was.” On March 31, Styles released the debut single from his upcoming third studio album “Harry’s House,” slated for a May 20 release date. 
“As It Was,” accompanied by a music video release, marks a new direction for Styles. His 2017 self-titled debut album was rock infused, while “Fine Line” found Styles exploring a more synth-heavy and bigger sound. “As It Was” strips all of that back, and Styles’ voice becomes the main focus of the lighter, poppier track. 
“As It Was” clocks in at just 2:47, following an industry-wide trend — Hot 100 hits are getting shorter. According to a recent  Ostereo study, the average chart leader in the United Kingdom dropped in total runtime by more than 1 minute since 1998. 
The light production and short runtime make “As It Was” appear primed for a classic summer radio mega-hit. 
On Heart Radio, Styles confirmed that the young girl’s voice, which mysteriously opens “As It Was” with “Come on Harry, we want to say goodnight to you,” is his goddaughter Ruby Winston. 
“[She] got a streak of calling me every night before bed, and I missed it once, and she wanted to let me know that she was quite angry with me,” Styles said. 
Driving percussion and Styles’ signature high pitched croon mask the song’s darker deep lyrical themes about change and personal growth. “Answer the phone / ‘Harry, you’re no good alone / Why are you sitting at home on the floor? / What kind of pills are you on?” highlight the difficulties that fame and success brought to Styles’ personal life. 
The chorus continues these melancholy themes with Styles singing, “You know it’s not the same as it was,” amid the song’s infectious instrumental. The hook, though only sung twice, quickly gets stuck in your head after just two listens. 
In the hit music video, Styles wears vibrant red nails to match his V-striped sequined and red jumpsuit and displays his striking butterfly tattoo prominently placed across his chest. 
Fan theories include the idea that Styles is a butterfly, always carefully observed, examined and picked apart by the media and fans. Though it may seem far-fetched, scenes from the music video find Styles laying on the ground among large metal pins.
The morning after the song’s release, Styles appeared on BBC’s Radio 1 Breakfast with Greg James to promote the new single and give insight about the upcoming album. “As It Was” was the last song that Styles said he wrote for “Harry’s House” and was written in the countryside an hour outside of London. 
“[As It Was] is about embracing change and losing oneself, finding oneself,” Styles said. 
Though it is clear that “As It Was” will undoubtedly play an essential part in  soundtracking the summer of 2022, the album, or at least a few of the 13 tracks, will hopefully showcase Styles venturing in more experimental directions, with songs that beautifully highlight his impressive and  expansive vocal range.

The bane of my college existence thus far has been fighting for comprehension against the very readings that should be helping me. Far too many times in this semester alone, I have read passages nearly 10 times over just to grasp a basic understanding of the material. With overcomplicated explanations and enough flowery language to establish a community garden, I spend most of my time in awe of the talent of rendering writing completely incomprehensible for your audience.
If we are trying to get some kind of a point across, what is so wrong with plain language? Apparently, many things — all of which are unbeknownst to the public and kept under seemingly maximum security by those in academia. After being confronted with so many convoluted writings, it becomes painfully clear that, more often than not, academics do not consider their nonacademic counterparts. And, somehow, the public witnesses the perpetual pissing contest between academicians to see who can create the most baffling article known to man.
There is no doubt that this approach to writing in academia is nothing short of an elitist form of gatekeeping. As I mentioned with the metaphorical “pissing contest,” it seems that many of these impenetrable writings never intended to inform a general audience — rather to flaunt the author’s specialized expertise to a very select audience: others in academia. 
This can be directly detrimental to society’s desire to learn. When everything you wish to learn about requires so much time and dedication just to comprehend a simple concept, it becomes defeating not being “clever” enough to sift through certain writings.
Academia’s far-too-common and cryptic way of writing directly contributes to an overall net loss for society. Academic gatekeeping deters the average reader, and articles that should be read by the public cannot be feasibly read or absorbed. 
But even more painful than the previous conclusion is the idea that we are regressing because of this kind of writing; despite the amazing leaps and bounds that we make socially, scientifically or technologically, it has arguably become more difficult for us to celebrate collectively when there is such rampant confusion in academic writing. 
However, I raise that the lack of a consistent vetting process in academic writing exacerbates this problem. The issue does not lie within the lack of quality concepts; rather, it lies with assuring that the writing serves its would-be purpose: to be read and understood by a general audience.
I can empathize with scholars in academia as it likely becomes difficult to distinguish what can be considered “common knowledge” to the public — especially following years and possibly decades of expertise in your field. Unfortunately, I do not find this to be a suitable enough excuse to disregard such a large potential audience. 
It is quite literally in the job description of an academic to be a vessel for learning, and selectively choosing who to educate is a failure on their behalf. Scholars could easily walk around this hurdle by having readers outside of the author’s specialization read their writing for clarity. Suggestions for more concise language and general comments to increase readability would undoubtedly benefit everyone.
A 2021 study conducted by Nooshin L. Warren and Matthew Farmer found that articles that scored highly in the clarity variable of their research were consistently cited more frequently on Google Scholar than articles with low clarity scores. Warren and Farmer’s research is comprehensible: “Articles with unclear writing make a smaller impact.”
For far too long, physical inaccessibility has been a barrier for people outside of higher education, and now, with the power of the internet, we are free to learn to our heart’s content. Publishing confusing writing that can only be successfully read by a select audience is contradictory to the entire purpose of writing in the first place. True academic scholars should wish to spread useful information — not to benefit from the temporary power trip of withholding knowledge from people who wish to learn.

Nothing compares to the arrival of spring: chirping chicks, blooming buds, fragrant foliage. But spring also encourages us to throw out the trash for some much needed spring cleaning — which for some of you is your entire personality.
Spring is a chance to reinvent before your next fling. Whether you look to be an entirely new person, try out some new hats (or personalities, if you will) or discover your identity, spring could be the perfect chance to try something different. 
Don’t know where to begin? Inspiration can be found anywhere — from the dark recesses of Marshall’s snake-filled hallways to the School of Architecture’s given-up-on-life vestibules. Mix and match until you find a combination that works for you. 
Less is more in normal circumstances, but when everything about you is irredeemable, you might want to start from scratch and build yourself one layer at a time. Here are some personality combinations to get your reinvention started:
Annenberg’s charming persona and people skills with a dash of SCA tortured artist
As both an Annenberg and SCA major, I can assure you no other combination comes close, but achieving this God-like status is not for everyone. The confident, all-knowing, always-on-Twitter Annenberg traits meld with the tortured, art-is-subjective and work-my-bones-off SCA persona to create a masterpiece. 
To successfully pull off the tortured artist personality, all you have to do is sigh a lot and come up with confusing, nonsensical interpretations of any media you consume. Some keywords that might help you achieve this are “auteur,” “pastiche,” “male gaze” and “use of color/sound/cinematography to convey…” If nothing else, talk about how the state of the character’s room or surroundings reflect their inner state and turmoil to fit right in. 
For the Annenberg portion, make sure you download Twitter and post or retweet serious articles along with some unhinged hot takes. To truly fit in, make sure to read up on news so you always have something to say on any topic that comes up. Absolutely bombard people you talk to with questions and nod along with whatever they say. Until you’ve acclimatized into the role, avoid any discussion about “fake news,” “distrust in media,” “decline of journalism” and “THE MEDIA” to avoid throwing hands.
Marshall’s snake-tendencies and networking prowess with a sprinkling of SDA’s mastery of being the center of attention
A very dangerous combination, this fusion of personalities is not for the faint of heart. In a spiral going after what you want and drawing attention to yourself while networking and forging strong connections — all sprinkled with hints of ruthlessness — it can be easy to lose all sense of yourself. 
If you wish to take on multiple personalities to blow the socks off any connection you meet, this could be the right fit for you. The SDA traits of playing different roles, tapping into other characters and always performing because “All the world’s a stage” will serve you well. 
Marshall’s resourcefulness and determination will help you get in the door, but to really play the part well, remember to put profits over people: mention capitalism saving America and talk your ear off about Crypto, NFTs and the metaverse. It can’t hurt to mention Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as your role models.
Viterbi’s smart and nerdy demeanor with a frosting of Dornsife’s resilience
The combination most likely to make a difference in the world and achieve success — Viterbi’s awkwardness and intelligence are complemented with the adaptability and strength of Dornsife for an award-making personality.
Viterbi’s hyperfocus and knowledge pair well with Dornsife’s jack-of-all-trades persona and resilience derived from not being taken seriously and working with less resources.
This pairing includes both logic and an understanding of human nature that make it a force to reckon with. Dornsife’s accepting persona will allow you to fit in with anybody, but there will be challenges in pretending to be a Viterbi kid without math and science skills. Just read some stuff about trains, airplanes or cars, that should probably do the trick.
Thornton’s passion meets Roski’s taste with a cherry topping of the School of Architecture’s hard work
A personality that demands perfection and follows their heart no matter the cost and challenges. The talent, the taste and the skills are impeccable but also require a lot of sacrifice. 
Not everyone has what it takes to excel at any cost and choose a harder path that does not gain enough recognition or respect compared to other mainstream options, which makes it the rarest personality type to cultivate.
Developing the skill necessary to truly succeed can be a steep hill to climb, but beyond the hill is a community of accepting and other talented individuals who will accept you. 
While building yourself a new personality is much harder and not as cute as taking home a stuffed animal with you at Build-A-Bear Workshop, making room for the new in your life by changing and becoming a better person is sometimes the only way to move forward. 
Once the trial period ends, make sure you’re truly satisfied with the personality you’ve chosen because you’re the only one who has to live with it.

Through two weeks of spring practice, Head Coach Lincoln Riley is having fun. 
When practices come around, he doesn’t want them to end. Riley said he gets the sense that players are feeling the same way — bringing energy and physicality to a team that lacked some of that as the 2021 season dragged to an end. 
The energy at spring practices continues to stick out but not as much as the overall competitiveness from players. 
“This team’s competitive nature, once the pads have gotten on, has risen,” said Riley during a Zoom press conference Saturday. “It’s been very positive so I think that’s been good.”
During former Head Coach Clay Helton’s tenure, a lack of accountability for players became increasingly common, with key penalties haunting the Trojans in games. Those accountability issues came out once Helton was fired, making Riley’s task of creating accountability crucial. 
So far, it seems he’s figured that portion of the problem out.
Riley joked that reporters would be on the Zoom the entire weekend if he broke down the steps taken to ensure accountability. He emphasized that the staff treats everything from going to class to the weight room as the same. 
“We’re all held to the same standard. There’s no leeway, there’s no excuses, there’s no ‘I thought,’ there’s no ‘We do it now, but when football season comes we don’t,’” Riley said. “That doesn’t matter. It’s the standard; it is what it is, every single person, every day and we’re going to be relentless about that.”
The Trojans have responded with “rapid progress,” Riley said. 
Breaking bad habits while instilling a culture of good habits can be tricky. However, he said that the staff attempts to “clearly articulate” not just everything they want from the players, but how they want them to do it. 
Most of the process behind building a strong culture is about choices. Unlike Helton’s era, players will need to consider the consequences of making wrong moves. 
“Guys that continually make the right choices are going to get better. They’re going to be a part of great things here,” Riley said. “[With] guys that don’t, there’s going to be repercussions. It is what it is, and I think it’s just a consistent approach and not taking into account guys’ experience before this.”
An aspect of culture change is the recent implementation of a helmet decal process, “Gold Plated.” 
Players start with a blank Cardinal helmet and work their way to the Trojans logo. Demonstrating habits off the field and on the field, having competitive nature, upholding accountability and showing reliability are all qualities that will earn a decal. 
Teammates can nominate each other for the decal with staff members giving the final stamp of approval. The number of players who have earned that decal has entered the double digits. 
“We felt like this is one of the most iconic programs; it’s one of the most iconic jerseys, helmet, uniform combo that there is, and we felt like that decal should be earned, not just given because you’ve got a spot on the roster,” Riley said. 
Redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyron Ware-Hudson and redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington have been “particularly fun to work with,” Riley said. With last season’s leading receiver Drake London heading to the NFL, Ware-Hudson and Washington could possibly carve themselves a role in the offense. 
Oklahoma transfer Mario Williams, Washington transfer Terrell Bynum and Colorado transfer Brenden Rice round out a loaded wide receiver room. Returnees, such as junior Gary Bryant Jr. and redshirt junior Kyle Ford, have garnered some attention too. 
For now, the culture changes will continue to be the topic of spring practice.

The NCAA Tournament draws to a close tonight as two of the sports’ bluest blue bloods face off in New Orleans. Kansas Head Coach Bill Self will lead his troops out against the North Carolina squad that ended Coach K’s storied career over the weekend. 
Let’s dive into how they got here and where they’re going.
Kansas
What a run it’s been for the Jayhawks, who pummeled Villanova 81-65 on their way to the national championship game. Senior guard Ochai Agbaji dropped in 6-of-7 threes and senior forward David McCormack added a cool 25 points to end any hopes the undermanned Wildcats had of securing their third title in the last six years.
Kansas seems to have hit its stride at the right time, as it squeaked by Creighton and Providence in the second and third rounds of March Madness before blowing out its last two opponents. Miami came face-to-face with the full potential of this team as the Jayhawks went on a 47-15 run in the second half to win. 
If Kansas can play the way it has for the last two games, there might not be a team in the country that can stop it. But the Tar Heels might have something to say about that.
North Carolina
No sixth championship for Coach K as North Carolina squeaked past Duke 81-77 Saturday. 
The Tar Heels flashed the kind of dominant two-way play that has carried them to the national showcase, as sophomore guard Caleb Love shined when the pressure was highest. A clutch 3-pointer from Love when they were down 75-74 kept them up for good, and the point guard hit three out of his four free throws after that point to ice the game. 
It hasn’t been an easy path to the championship for North Carolina, as it dispatched No. 1 seeded Baylor and St. Peter’s, the most successful 15-seed in NCAA history. 
Oklahoma transfer Brady Manek has shared the load on offense with Love, supplementing a defense dominant since March 1. Junior forward Armando Bacot, who was named to the first-team All-ACC, has led the way off the glass, posting the most double-doubles in the ACC since Tim Duncan.
Who wins?
In a game on the biggest stage in college hoops, experience wins out as Self leads Kansas to its fourth NCAA title. While Tar Heels Head Coach Hubert Davis has had a remarkable first season, Self has been doing this for a few more years. He’ll game-plan to perfection, shutting down Love and Manek with his experienced cast. The Jayhawks are used to dealing with Manek, as the forward spent four years at Oklahoma before transferring. 
While much has been said of North Carolina’s outstanding starting five, almost no attention has been paid to its bench. When Kansas makes a concerted effort to foul its first five out, it’ll be that bench that will have to contend with a Jayhawks team that ranks No. 6 in adjusted offensive efficiency rankings per Kenpom.  
Watch for a resurgent Agbaji to continue his hot shooting on his way to Final Four MVP honors.
What would this title mean for both squads?
For Kansas, this title would finally vindicate all the top seeds and Big-12 championships the Jayhawks have racked up under Self. A second title would put Self among truly elite company in NCAA basketball history, a deserved honor for a man who has mastered the regular season. 
For super-senior point guard Remy Martin, a title would be the perfect ending to a rocky season at Kansas after transferring from Arizona State. For the Jayhawks’ first-team All-American, Agbaji, a title would be the ultimate cherry on the cake for a player that went from a 247Sports 3-star recruit to a National Player of the Year candidate. 
For North Carolina, a title would ring in a new era of basketball under Davis. Following Roy Williams was never going to be easy, but a title in your first year would do quite nicely. A team of underrated journeymen would finally get their due praise. 
Love deserves much praise for his elevated game in the post-season. Senior guard Leaky Black has never gotten the recognition a man of his two-way talents deserves. Even Manek’s transformation from Larry Bird-look alike to mountain man would get its time in the sun after a Tar Heel title.
