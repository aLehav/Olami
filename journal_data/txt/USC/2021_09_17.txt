The appeal of anonymity has only been exacerbated by the past year’s reliance on Zoom courses. Without the ability to bare their hearts to their crushes in person, many USC students publicly pined for their remote crushes on @usc.missedconnections, an Instagram page which now boasts over 5,800 followers.  
Thousands of students have used the page’s anonymous submission form to express their interest in the students they keep pinned to their Zoom window during online classes, Trader Joe’s and Dulce employees with impressive style and professors they’re secretly crushing on. 
The page was created by sophomores Will Domke and Calvin Mattson in October 2020, with Domke lately serving as the main administrator.  The two SDA students now receive anywhere from 20 to 30 submissions per day. If you’ve ever submitted a confession and didn’t see it posted, don’t feel personally offended. The page has over 700 submissions on backlog from past semesters. Domke has even resorted to deleting old submissions to keep posts fresh.
Domke and Mattson, majoring in acting and theatre, respectively, met online while looking for roommates for the 2020-2021 school year. When a conversation on the pair’s mutual acceptance into Emerson College shifted to the school’s confession page, Domke and Mattson figured a similar one would do well at USC. 
“When we started it, we literally made up the first few submissions,” Domke said. “We were like, we’re going to fake them and so people will be more comfortable with sending in real ones.”
The pair anticipated they would have to do that for a while but got a flurry of posts from Trojans looking to make connections. They still detail, however, receiving submissions, this time from the student body. People often submit them for themselves and their friends. 
“There was this one guy from some frat — I don’t remember which one —  but he kept sending things in about like, blah, blah, blah, in this frat,” Domke said. “And I was like, ‘there’s no way.’ I just stopped posting ones from him. Sorry to him. Maybe you just have a bunch of admirers!”
The two promised their rapidly growing following a face reveal at 5,000 followers but eventually forgot about it. 
“This can be our unofficial admin reveal, our soft launch,” Domke said about the article.
According to Domke, the popularity of the confession page can largely be attributed to people’s need to live vicariously through the secrets of others.
“It’s fun to read things that people have admitted that are maybe a little bit embarrassing,” Domke said. “People love rumors, and this is a place where you could just live vicariously through other people’s little crushes and rumours.” 
The page’s popularity hasn’t just drawn attention from students. Domke’s, along with other college confession pages, has garnered coverage from major news networks.
“We did a little interview for the Los Angeles Times. We were in the print edition,” Domke said. “My mom sent me the article. She was like, ‘Did you hear about this?’”
Despite the page’s popularity, secret confessions aren’t always well-received. One post on the page expressed users’ concerns over triggering elements of some posts and received support in the comments. It especially raised concerns over those that contain sexually aggressive language.
Another post on the page featured someone who indicated they were a resident assistant confessing their interest in a former resident of theirs.
Junior Jeniffer Velazquez commented on the post, half-jokingly telling the student to “run.”
“When you are a person of authority and have some kind of attraction toward a person that [you’re] supposed to be helping, especially an RA — these are most likely students that are fresh to college — there’s just a weird advantage in that situation,” Velazquez said.
After reflecting on the harms of giving these people a platform, Domke and Matthison have devoted more thought into minimizing sexually aggressive comments and analyzing the dynamics of sexual speech. They pay special attention to the dynamics of sexual situations described.
“I try to think about the language that [the person] uses and who is acting upon who,” Domke said. “So, if someone is like, ‘rail me,’ then I’m like, OK … that’s someone asking someone to act upon them. That’s different [from] them being like, ‘let me hit.’ It’s very pedantic, but that is something that I think about; like if someone is asking for someone to do something to them as opposed to the other way around, then I’m generally more cool with it.”
The page has especially become more cautious about publishing posts where students comment on others’ bodies.
“It could make someone feel really weird. We have moved away from that kind of stuff this semester,” Domke said. “But if we still receive enough of those submissions, it would be dishonest not to post some of them. If people are creative with it, I’m more inclined to post it.”
Some think that when students tag those that appear in the post, much harm is already done. A student who wished to remain anonymous out of concerns for privacy and safety said a large concern of theirs is that this trend can expose subjects’ personal information to people they would rather remain unknown to.
One way Domke and Matthison respond to these criticisms is by deleting posts at subjects’ request, without question. 
“We’ve had some people be like, ‘hey, can you take this down? It’s about me,’ and then we just take it down. We have to. Why would you not take it down?” Domke said. “We always repost without the confession, and I do feel annoyed sometimes, but I just have to do it.”
In Domke’s own words, confession pages “can, as documented in so many shows, very quickly become bad and toxic.” Domke dedicates just five to 10 minutes to each post, but the real challenge has been taking on the responsibility of critically thinking through issues of privacy, consent and safety. Through these guidelines, Domke hopes to maintain the page’s most important value: that these posts are fun and provide comedic relief to the USC community.
Domke hopes to continue the page after graduating, and based on the popular reception, it seems like students will continue to enjoy reading these secrets. 
“Hopefully, we’ll find people to take it over,” Domke said. “But I don’t even know if Instagram’s even going to be popular in three or fours years. So I’m just kind of going with it. I’m happy with where we are.”

I think that Guy Fieri should host the Oscars. That’s possibly because I believe that no award show is fit without some good food and well-meaning-but-equally-quippy comments of which Fieri has plenty. It’s likely also because, over quarantine, I found the beauty of cooking and baking shows. 
There is one in particular, beyond the bright lights and loud voices of the Food Network, from another continent. Maybe you know of it. There’s some gingham tablecloths, a certain judge with blue eyes that can see directly into your souls, two mischievous sidekicks, “bingate” and a mantra that there shall be “no soggy bottoms:” the “Great British Bake Off” (or GBBO depending on your persuasion). I was excited when I opened Twitter to see Netflix announce a new episode of the show will be released every Friday starting Sept. 24. I was ecstatic for yet another reason to look forward to Fridays and perhaps an excuse to try my hand at a way-too-complicated recipe. 
My personal culinary talent extends only to the frozen food aisle at Trader Joe’s. My own lack of expertise isn’t to say that I can’t appreciate food. In fact, it is probably because of my limited recipe expertise that I love food so much. Of course, nowhere are food descriptions so plentiful than books (and recipe books, I suppose). 
The first book that makes me crave food is “This Time Next Year” by Sophie Cousens. It’s chock-full of female friendship, the “where do you see yourself this time next year?” and, of course, food. Our main character Minnie Cooper (yes, you read that right) is a chef battling bad luck that characterizes her whole life. At a New Year’s Eve party that falls on her birthday, she spends the whole night trapped in the bathroom and her rescuer happens to be Quinn Hamilton, who she believes has stolen her luck. This book makes me crave food as Minnie’s pie business, No Hard Fillings, is frequently lauded for having the absolute best pies. It’s a sweet book that has its share of grand romantic gestures,missed opportunities and fittingly, more than one reference to GBBO. 
You may have heard about slam-poet Elizabeth Acevedo’s breakout freshman novel “The Poet X,” but I think it’s about time that you also checked out her 2019 novel “With the Fire on High,” which tackles teen pregnancy, ambition and a teen’s culinary aspirations. Our main character, high school senior Emoni, treats the kitchen as therapy.  Emoni hopes to go to Spain to become a chef and cook with her culinary arts class, but her child “Babygirl” has changed all of that. In place of section dividers, each one begins with a recipe such as “Emoni’s ‘No Use Crying Over Spilled Strawberry Milk’” and instructions that include “keep on the stove for the duration of three listens to a Cardi B song.” Acevedo’s prose is as sharp and as warm as the verse that made up “The Poet X” and the book feels familiar — not because it is derivative but because I suppose that’s what food does to you. 
Whenever I hear bubblegum pop on the radio, I immediately remember that I am probably due for a reread of Jenny Han’s much-adored “To all the Boys I’ve Loved Before.” I am nearly certain that you have probably heard that title in relation to adaptation stars Noah Centineo and Lana Condor, but I am here to remind you (from my own personal experience) the book is better! Han’s first installment in the trilogy is akin to bubblegum pop, not because it is pure fluff, but because it feels bright while tackling some significant issues. If Acevedo’s books scream autumn, Han’s books feel like the one day in between winter and spring. In the first chapter, two of the three sisters make snickerdoodles together, already symbolizing how food brings them together. The plot follows our main character Lara Jean and her five love letters that get mistakenly sent out by a mysterious someone and the chaos that ensues as a result. Han writes as if Lara Jean is just talking to the reader about her day over a cup of coffee in a very aesthetically pleasing coffee shop. 
The final book that makes me hungry is actually a longtime favorite I find to be terribly underrated. “The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender” by Leslye Walton is a young adult, magical-realism, multigenerational story that deserves to be adorning your “BookTok” feed. It follows a family through many different eras and heartbreaks. Of course, the image of a French bakery with warm bread and pastries is brought to life by the lyrical writing. I’ve never been able to write a coherent review of this book partially because of how it has nestled itself into my favorites shelf. It is a perfect read as we make our way into autumn. 
If the forthcoming season of pumpkin bread and warm soup has already invited you back into the world of reading, check out the books above. Maybe by the time of my next column, I’ll have mastered Lara Jean’s snickerdoodles.

Soft purple lights illuminated the stage as students quickly shuffled into Bovard Auditorium Wednesday night for the Welcome Back Comedy Show. Thrilled for the first in-person comedy event at USC since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, students waved to friends across the aisles and murmured to their neighbors, eagerly awaiting the upcoming student performances and the night’s headliner Patti Harrison, known best for her supporting role as Ruthie on Hulu’s “Shrill” and her work in the 2021 film “Together, Together.” 
Though the Special Events Committee held a smaller, online comedy event last year, the live nature of this show came with its unique challenges and triumphs. 
“It was definitely a learning curve because managing all the in-person facilities and advertising and getting the word out there and not just sending out a Zoom link was different than what we’ve done for the past year,” SEC director Lianna Treitler said. “But it is also more exciting because we get to see people’s faces, meet people, plan a set, do lighting … being able to hear people laugh and clap and make comments without being muted on Zoom.”
The show opened with the student improv troupe, Spoiler Alert, which included sophomore Matthew Christofferson, senior Ruby Marker, juniors Gabie Faulkner and Bebe Katsenes and sophomore Billy Nayman. During their set, they debated the nature of religion and bagels, acted out the mishaps of a bumbling intern and a neurotic secretary in the Oval Office and compared potential love interests to frying pans. This high-energy performance captivated the audience from the start.
After Spoiler Alert, two student stand-up comedians took the stage. Senior Jonathan Krone, the president of USComedians entertained the crowd with his bit on his brief stint in physical therapy and his favorite payment captions on Venmo. Senior Angie Stroud, performed a routine about being a young, biracial and bisexual comedian because as she put it, “I cannot make a decision!” Her final anecdote about being confused for an escort instead of a USC bus driver last year was a crowd-pleaser. 
When the curtains finally opened for Harrison, the whole room erupted in applause and enthusiastic cheers. She opened with a few jokes about aging and facetiously commented on her sexuality and mental health before diving into the main event: her parody songs. 
Harrison performed two songs: one previously rejected by Charli XCX and the other by Stevie Nicks. The ridiculous lyrics, about a drunken adventure in a Toyota and taking an old lover to the beach, energized the wild audience. During these performances, her voice ranged from deep bellowing to a squeaky falsetto, as she pranced around stage and further showcased her hilariously awkward physical comedy. 
“I haven’t been feeling very funny,” said Harrison while explaining her experience during the coronavirus pandemic. 
But the crowd certainly disagreed on Wednesday night, as the entire room exploded in uproarious laughter after every routine.
“She was really brilliant,” said Sarah Cortina, a junior majoring in communication. “I thought it was cool that she played a character while also just being herself.”
Not only was Harrison entertaining, she also offered helpful advice and insight into her own career. Harrison spoke with the moderators and members of another campus improv troupe, Commedus Interruptus’ Ava Bunn and Frankie Nayman, while addressing the audience and student comedians in a Q&A session. 
“I’m obsessed with her, and I want to have a career very similar to hers,” Bunn said. 
As a lively performer and an acute speaker, Harrison did a wonderful job captivating the crowd and complementing the opening acts. The event was a resounding success, drawing in many student spectators and highlighting both the talents of USC’s own comics and the exceptional Harrison.

Student Health may drop the weekly coronavirus testing requirement in the coming weeks if case counts and positivity rates continue to plateau, USC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said at a student health media briefing Thursday. 
As vaccination rates increase, in part because of international students who previously did not have access to the vaccine, the positivity rates among students and staff continue to decline. 
Of the 33,389 tests administered from Sept. 5 to Sept. 11, 78 students and five employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The .24% positivity rate for students is the lowest reported since last May, and the .38% faculty positivity rate is down from .89% the week before.
Low transmission levels coupled with high vaccination rates have prompted USC health officials to reconsider the current coronavirus testing mandate that requires all students -— regardless of vaccination status — to test every week to remain in compliance with Trojan Check. 
“We are seeing a very nice decline [in positivity rates], and I really think it’s due to the testing, the masking, high vaccine rates and the numbers starting to fall in [L.A.] County,” Van Orman said. “We’re pleased with where the numbers are, but we still don’t know what the trends are going to be.” 
Van Orman said Student Health wants to see around two more weeks of testing data before a final decision is made about the future of the weekly surveillance testing requirement on campus. 
“Our goal is to stop the requirement for routine surveillance testing,” Van Orman said. “That’s our primary goal at some point, but we need to see the trend first.”
Van Orman described mask-wearing and hand hygiene as “critical” health preventative measures due to other circulating viral illnesses that typically emerge in the fall. Van Orman said Student Health follows coronavirus protocols as given from federal, state and county guidance, which has remained constant despite substantial decreases in cases, positivity rates and hospitalizations in Los Angeles County.
The mask mandate for indoor and large outdoor venues remains in effect, and L.A. County recently issued a new health officer order that will require proof of vaccination to enter indoor bars, nightclubs and breweries. Residents must have one dose completed by Oct. 7 and receive their second shots by Nov. 4.
Van Orman said these community mitigation efforts have implications on the campus coronavirus trends, as students are increasingly engaging in high-risk activities in the broader L.A. community. 
“We do know that when we look at a lot of outbreaks … we have a number of cases and outbreaks that are associated with going to nightclubs and other [social] gatherings,” Van Orman said. “[Those activities] are really the highest risk type of venue, so I think [the new vaccine rule] is a really proactive step to try to limit the risks associated with those types of activities.” 
Since the beginning of the fall semester, 469 USC students have tested positive for the coronavirus. Van Orman said every confirmed case has been mild in terms of the severity — no students have required hospitalization or received intrusive treatment to manage their condition. 
While cases have not led to hospitalizations, Van Orman said Student Health has analyzed preliminary data of 100,000 on-campus coronavirus tests, showing that 80% of those who tested positive were symptomatic. 
“So really what that suggests is that people with COVID are symptomatic, even if it’s low-level symptomatic,” Van Orman said. “It really stresses the importance of taking that Trojan Check screening seriously and staying home if you have any low-level symptoms, and that’s really the purpose of Trojan Check — because people we’re finding so far do have some level of symptoms.” 
While the coronavirus trends on campus remain a pressing priority for Student Health, Van Orman said her office is preparing to push flu vaccinations. She said flu shots will be administered at the Lyon Center, and there will be an announcement about how to access them next week. 
Additionally, Van Orman said Student Health is starting to see other viral illnesses circulate around campus, like upper respiratory tract infections.
“It’s concerning because in a normal year most cases [would be] mild, self-limited illnesses, and people would treat themselves, but in the era of COVID, people who have other viral symptoms like sore throat or congestion are having to isolate until their symptoms improve and then get a negative coronavirus test,” Van Orman said. 
While coronavirus cases are declining, Student Health acknowledged how circulating viral infections may pose complications to the coronavirus response. 
“It’s going to be a challenging year that’s one of the reasons why we’re pushing [vaccinations] so much [because] the more we can stop other viruses from spreading, the easier it’s going to be for everyone,” Van Orman said.

When Emma Brunel was looking at law schools, she knew that she wanted to attend a school with a supportive student community. 
“The law school mindset can be a bit toxic sometimes in many schools and really competitive in how it’s set up,” said Brunel, a first year student studying law. “[Gould] just has a good way … and I’m here now and can verify that. People are really helpful with each other and the competitiveness is not as strong as it would have been in other schools.” 
Brunel is one member of Gould’s Class of 2024, one of the “most diverse classes to date,” according to a Monday news release. The first-year class, composed of 212 students ranging from 20 to 44 years old from 31 states, has the lowest acceptance rate in the school’s history at 13%. 
“I think it’s a continuation of the tradition of excellence that we’ve had here,” said David Kirschner, associate dean of admissions for Gould’s JD program. “I think it’s representative of the strength of the Gould education and the desire that prospective students have to attend law school in such a dynamic university in such a dynamic city.” 
Being a member of such an accomplished class was “reassuring” for Brunel. 
“It’s easy in law school to think that maybe you’re not at the right place, maybe you’re not as good as everyone else, kind of like an imposter syndrome,” Brunel said. “Reminding yourself that … it was a really competitive cycle and that you were chosen and picked and just a few [were] picked, makes you feel good and gives you some confidence for the year.” 
For Kirschner, however, it is the students’ “diversity of experiences” that makes the class so special. 
“We have an incredibly talented class academically, and a class with diversity across so many different facets of what it means to be diverse, from students of color to women to a wide variety of work experiences and life experiences,” Kirschner said. 
Brunel said that having classmates with a myriad of different backgrounds was “really important” and that she didn’t understand that as much before arriving at Gould. 
“I think that it’s so rich to have all these different personalities and different backgrounds in the same class,” Brunel said. “When you exchange with those people, they have so much to teach you.”
In addition to 50% of the first-year class identifying as a member of a minority group and 14% as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, the class also has the highest proportion of women students at 63%. 
“Being a woman in law school is definitely very interesting. It’s inspiring,” said Soleil Montemurro, a first year student studying law. “Law firms are predominantly male. They’re still currently mostly male, which means that the jobs that we’re going to be applying into, we’re more likely to be interviewed by men, which is definitely a different environment than what we’re in now, but we are kind of changing the face of that because there are so many of us.” 
Students in the first-year class also come from a range of backgrounds and with an array of experiences, such as having climbed Mount Everest, worked in finance or written best-selling books. 
“It feels good but intimidating [to be a part of this class],” said Noah Reid, a first year student studying law. “There’s a lot of accomplishments and I was pretty impressed, and it was fun to be among those and have those people become my friends and peers.” 
Despite the scope of accomplishments members of the class possess, Reid said that everyone is “friendly and helpful.” 
“There’s always stereotypes about law school being cutthroat,” Reid said. “Showing up here and the people that I’ve met, it’s for sure a true statement but like it’s a very collegial, helpful, friendly atmosphere to learn everything.” 
For Montemurro, the range of racial backgrounds, ages and experiences of her classmates makes the environment feel less like she’s just a student in school and instead a member of a diverse team. 
“It feels more like an actual community of contributing viewpoints and perspectives,” Montemurro said. “Obviously when you work in an office or wherever, you’re not the same age as everyone, so it’s kind of nice to have the diversity of that.”

Russell Westbrook is a stat-padder, loaded with flaws too substantial to overcome. Anthony Davis is soft and unable to stay healthy. LeBron James is washed, sent packing after the first round of the playoffs for the first time in his career. Carmelo Anthony is incapable of contributing to winning basketball, too selfish before and too old now. 
These narratives are adding fuel to the fire for a team that needs no extra motivation. 
No longer on the road to repeat, the Los Angeles Lakers are on a new path: the road to revival. 
Organizations across sports garner extremely different expectations. Take USC, for example, firing Clay Helton despite winning 65% of his games as head coach. Sounds pretty good, but at USC, that is not enough. The prestige and historic success of the University makes it a top-10 program, and with that comes top-10 expectations.
It’s a similar story with the Lakers — first round exits simply will not cut it. 
This storied franchise doesn’t hang 17 banners in Staples Center without having legitimate championship aspirations, especially when guys like Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant and now James wear the purple and gold. 
This season is very much championship-or-bust for this team. They have too much talent to not have their sights set on the Larry O’Brien trophy.
That’s exactly what general manager Rob Pelinka signed up for when he prioritized talent over fit during the offseason. Adding a dreadful shooter in Westbrook next to mediocre shooters in James and Davis feels like seeing someone wearing socks with sandals: It just doesn’t fit. 
The Lakers were on the verge of acquiring guard Buddy Hield from Sacramento, eventually backtracking into a deal for Westbrook. 
Hield would have slid perfectly into the starting lineup. He was one of just five players to shoot at least six catch-and-shoot threes per game last season, nailing almost 40% of those shots. 
The addition of Hield while also keeping Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who was shipped to Washington in the Westbrook trade, would have given the Lakers versatile lineups with the ability to defend and shoot the three — two necessities in the modern NBA. 
But Westbrook is too talented to pass up. He literally averaged a triple-double last season — for the fourth time in five seasons. Westbrook is a scary player to go up against. What’s even scarier is a hungry, motivated version of Westbrook — and he’s got something to prove. 
If he wants to be in the conversation of the best point guards of all time, he knows he needs that elusive championship. 
The fit is clunky but man, Westbrook, James and Davis. It almost feels unbelievable that we will see all three future Hall of Famers on the same team in one month’s time. 
The question is and always will be health. The main objective is to get the Big 3 to the playoffs in one piece — easier said than done — with relatively good seeding. This is exactly why James wanted Westbrook. 
James is 36 years old, turning 37 this season, coming off a high ankle sprain just months ago and entering his 19th NBA season. Westbrook takes a tremendous load off James’ shoulders during the regular season. James could rest several games since Westbrook and Davis are enough to win regular season games without him. 
Westbrook’s endless motor will sustain the high energy and intensity that James simply cannot give every single night anymore. If James can lean on Westbrook and get to the playoffs healthy, a chance to win that championship is high, regardless of the fit. 
Pelinka deserves a ton of credit for bringing the Lakers back to the top again, generating buzz that only the Lakers can bring. Johnson played a huge part in bringing James in 2018, but Pelinka has followed that up with right moves, and his latest, adding Mr. Triple Double, is the cherry on top. 
We are all burning with curiosity. We will all be tuning in during the season to see what the LakeShow looks like, because no one has a clue right now. And that is exactly the type of national attention the Lakers want. 
Bravo, Rob Pelinka.

After a 5-0 start to the season, the men’s water polo team shot up to a joint No. 1 CWPA ranking. This weekend, the Trojans will look to prove themselves against three top-15 schools in the Aggie Roundup, all of whom they’ve never lost to: No. 11 San José State, No. 14 Santa Clara and No. 8 UC Davis. 
“We’re getting ready for every opponent the same way. Be it the number one, second, third or 10th ranked team in the nation, we are always taking the same approach,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “We are [not going] with the attitude that we already have a win.”
USC will begin the invitational Friday against the Spartans. In their most recent 2019 matchup, the Trojans finished with a 17-9 victory behind hat tricks from redshirt junior driver Hannes Daube and redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep, who played with the Spartans his freshman year.
San José State enters the Roundup as a battle-tested 2-4 team: Half of its matches have been tightly-contested games against top eight programs. USC has never suffered defeat against the Spartans and will hope to continue its stellar defensive play, with 5.8 goals allowed per game on a .234 goal conversion rate.
“[Those are] numbers that we can say proudly. And I believe that if we keep on this run on defense, it will pay out at the end of the season,” Mercep said. “I’m hoping to see some very good defensive stops and not a lot of goals against [us].”
The matchup against Santa Clara is similar: a solid squad that has dropped games against other ranked opponents. In their two ranked matches against No. 3 Stanford and San José State, the Broncos have struggled in powerplay defense, conceding 61.1% of the time when down a player. The Trojans will look to play an aggressive attack and draw fouls Saturday.
USC will finish the weekend against the Aggie Roundup host, UC Davis. Davis enters the tournament unbeaten through five games, including a win against San José State and a 14-13 overtime victory over No. 15 Bucknell. This matchup should give a good indication of where USC stands, with a Trojan offense that scores 22.3 goals a game battling an Aggie defense that only allows a 38.7% shot conversion rate.
By the end of the weekend, Mercep could punch his ticket into the top-five of USC’s all-time scoring list. Sitting at 165 goals, the Croatian driver will likely move into sixth place, surpassing Danny Leyson, the current UC Davis head coach.
“I think that’s a nice thing to be appreciated. But all that matters is that we win a championship,” Mercep said. “Everything else is not secondary but tertiary.”
Despite entering each match this weekend as the favorite, the Trojans feel the same way about their new No. 1 ranking.
“Honestly, the numbers [and] the ranking don’t really matter,” junior driver Chris Sturtevant said. “Obviously, I think we should be number one, always. But the end goal is just to win the national championship … I’m happy wherever we are, as long as [we] win the national championship.”
The team shares that title-driven mindset, and this weekend is its first true chance to put it into practice. USC plays San José State Friday at 1 p.m. On Saturday, USC takes on Santa Clara at 11:30 a.m. and UC Davis at 4 p.m.

USC admission for Fall 2021 was highly competitive and selective. As a result of the large and talented applicant pool, USC’s admission rate dwindled to 12%. Declining acceptance rates highlight one of the many difficulties Generation-Z faces. 
The advent of social media is another hallmark unique to Gen-Z. While interconnectedness has its benefits, social platforms also act as discouraging and negative energy sources. Furthermore, Gen-Z college graduates are entering an increasingly competitive job market. This means they will likely need to pursue various internship and research opportunities to load up their resume. 
Because of these rising academic practices and social interconnectedness, Gen-Z lives in a toxic and stressful environment, which is burdensome on mental health. It also impedes both academic and social development, which is concerning because they are the future leaders of this world.  
Anyone born between the years 1997-2012 is considered Gen-Z, meaning the older end of that age range is between 18-24. This age range is typically when students apply, attend and graduate college. Again, college acceptance rates have been on the decline for the past 11 years. Let’s take a look at the numbers. 
In 2010, USC received 35,794 applications and yielded an admit rate of 24%. In 2021, USC received nearly 71,000 applications and yielded an admit rate of 12%. The volume of applications has doubled. Consequently, the acceptance rate has been cut in half. 
Unfortunately, the increasing selectivity makes the college application cycle more toxic — students deal with rejection and do not receive the opportunity to study where they desire. 
The price tag of a college education continues to rise as well. In 2009 and 2010, USC tuition amounted to $39,183. This year, tuition is a whopping $60,446. The rising cost of education also lends itself to increased student debt. The national average undergraduate student debt was $15,590 in 2010. Forward to 2020, that number sits at $36,635. If they want a degree, Gen-Z students have to pay a costly price and prepare for student debt. 
However, deciding whether to pursue a degree doesn’t feel like a choice anymore. In a study conducted in 2018, researchers found that 9 out of 10 new jobs are going to those with a college degree. Without a degree, one would be facing staggering odds of succeeding in the job market. 
In addition to dealing with academic and career obstacles, Gen-Z has dealt with social media’s emergence since they were children. Twitter came to fruition in 2006, Instagram launched in 2010 and Snapchat was released to the masses in 2011. Gen-Z was between the ages of 5-14 during this period. 
While social media has revolutionized marketing and made the world more interconnected, it has also led to an increase in mental health concerns for Gen-Z. A survey found that 48% of Gen-Z feel a negative psychological impact from social media, such as anxiety and depression. Social media allows us to see what everyone is doing, opening the pathway to compare ourselves to our peers. 
This is a dangerous trail to tread because it is easy to start using these comparisons as metrics of success, whether it be about body image or academic success. Consequently, we face exacerbated levels of imposter syndrome, depression and body dysmorphia.
Social media also makes information quickly accessible. News from across the world spreads in seconds. News of mass shootings, climate change and terrorist attacks reach our fingertips immediately. 
Compared to past generations, Gen-Z is more distressed when they see these issues in the news. This signifies that these issues matter to them and they can empathize with those in pain. However, constantly feeling responsible for each issue can cause tension, anxiety and depression.
So, how should society help Gen-Z deal with all these challenges that are seemingly on every front?
For starters, elite universities, such as USC, should start accepting more students. The classic counter to this argument is that if exclusivity decreases, quality decreases as well. This is not necessarily true.
The University of Michigan has increased its enrollment by 35% since 1990 and remained in the top 25 schools in the U.S. News & World Report rankings. In Canada, the top three universities — The University of Toronto, McGill University and the University of British Columbia — combine for more than 150,000 undergraduate students. That is more than the top 18 U.S universities in the U.S. News & World report combined. 
These universities all demonstrate that education quality does not decrease as volume of students increases. Increasing enrollment would allow for more Gen-Z students to receive higher education while stressing less about college rejection. 
In regard to opportunities, making college more affordable matters just as much. Universities can start making progress by shifting financial aid from merit-based to need-based. 
A study from 2006 found that over 25% of merit-based financial aid went to students in the top income quartile. This takes away from students who need financial assistance to attend college. Altering aid distribution would be a great step in alleviating financial tensions for Gen-Z and the generations that follow.
Finally, dealing with social media can be tricky, especially when staying off these platforms can easily make us feel FOMO — fear of missing out. 
However, it is worth it sometimes. Social media detoxes can be beneficial for reconnecting with the physical world and focusing on yourself. A study also found that heavy usage of social media and digital devices can negatively affect sleep. Therefore, taking a break from these platforms will improve our sleep, and who doesn’t love sleep?
Implementing each of these solutions is necessary. Universities must adjust their financial aid and acceptance rates to combat this toxicity. Gen-Z also needs to self-manage their social media habits to help purify the environment that they currently experience and that following generations are in line to enter.

On Saturday, USC (1-1) will face Washington State (1-1) in Pullman, Wash. — the schools’ 75th all-time matchup. The Trojans have only lost four times when visiting Pullman; the team has only lost 10 times in total since their first matchup against the Cougars in 1921.
 Last season, USC continued this run by defeating Washington State 38-13, scoring four touchdowns early. However, following head coach Clay Helton’s firing and a demoralizing 42-28 loss Saturday against Stanford, the Trojans are still recovering.
“It stings,” defensive coordinator Todd Orlando said after Wednesday’s practice about Helton’s firing. “That day was a lot of talk.” 
The Trojans will begin a new era of football Saturday with the debut of interim head coach Donte Williams. Williams is the first Black head coach in the football team’s history.
To defeat Washington State, the Trojans will look to clean up penalties in the secondary. Nine penalties were called against USC during the Stanford game, most of which came from the defensive end. 
Orlando seemed unfazed with USC’s struggles with the Stanford passing attack. 
“It happens … this is all correctable stuff,” he said. “This is not what we’re about and we just move forward.”
Jayden de Laura, WSU’s sophomore starting quarterback, ranks 18th in passing efficiency in the Power Five. If the Trojans continue to struggle to put pressure on the quarterback, Laura is well-equipped to put the Trojans behind early. 
On the other side of the ball, Harrell emphasized moving on from Saturday’s game and taking as much as possible from it.
“To me the greatest thing about sports is it teaches you about life,” Harrell said. “You get beat sometimes. You have to try to learn from it, see where you can be better and make the improvements you need to make.” 
The Trojan offense has often started slow with multiple three-and-out drives to begin games. 
After the San José State game, Harrell thought junior quarterback Kedon Slovis was not spreading the ball enough, citing junior wide receiver Drake London’s target share. However, Slovis was able to fix this against Stanford with 11 players recording a reception.
USC’s red-zone and third down struggles continued in the Stanford game too. This season, USC has scored on an abysmal four of nine trips to the red zone. The Trojans were also four of 12 on third down attempts against Stanford.  
“You have to finish. You have to execute and that is what I have preached since I’ve been here,” Harrell said. 
If the offensive efficiency struggles again, the Trojans could have trouble keeping up with a Cougar offense that scored 44 points against Portland State last week. 
On the defensive side for Washington State, senior cornerback Jaylen Watson will get the job of containing London. 
The Cougars are also comfortable rushing the passer, which can lead to Slovis being under pressure during the game. Washington State’s defense has forced an interception in each of its first two games, and forcing errors will definitely be a tenant of defensive coordinator Jake Dickert’s strategy Saturday. 
The Trojans remain optimistic about the prospects for this season. 
“I’m pretty damn excited about what this team can do,” redshirt junior punter Ben Griffiths said. 
USC will face Washington State with a new coach at the helm Saturday at 12:30 p.m.

A few weeks back, I wrote about the importance of updating nursing homes to better accommodate a new generation of older residents — changing procedures for pandemic-related events and improving the general atmosphere from a “retro diner” energy. 
However, I realized that while improving the day-to-day environment is important for older adults, it’s the notion of resilience in the face of danger that determines a person’s quality of life as they get older. 
With that being said, the recent tragedies in Louisiana nursing homes spotlight an absolute need to incorporate and address the needs of older adults during the planning phase of any government-related intervention. The undignified and terrifying final moments for these older adults, trapped within their own living space as water levels continued to rise, should never have happened in the first place.
It is without question that natural disasters are dangerous — that’s why they’re called disasters. However, these events will negatively impact groups to different degrees. 
First, environmental stressors fluctuate after natural disasters and affect the body in different ways. From flooding to wildfires, these destructive events dramatically tilt the balance, or homeostasis, of those ecosystems. 
Regarding age, the body’s response to said changes will change as you get older. Take the heat in Los Angeles, for example. On a molecular and physiological level, a younger person’s body responds to something as simple as a few ticks up on the global thermometer much differently  compared to the bodies of older people. The body naturally undergoes wear and tear throughout the life course, making it harder to adjust to external stressors with age. 
That doesn’t mean that all older people break like a twig during a hurricane or forget what an earthquake feels like, per se. It’s key to reeducate and build upon existing knowledge by improving preparation strategies to new pieces of equipment for periods of isolation. 
Socioeconomic status also mediates natural disasters’ impact on certain individuals. On a much grander scale than L.A., countries such as the United States and Japan demonstrate better resilience and response to natural disasters compared to less affluent countries such as the Philippines or Bangladesh. Nevertheless, this does not excuse the exclusion of older adults from preparedness plans.
“But Lois,” you, being the inquisitive reader, say. “It would be genuinely unethical and immoral if there were no texts mentioning how to take care of older adults in a natural disaster. I mean, they are and have been considered a vulnerable population.”
You’re right, but the inclusion of older adults in text can be compared to the genomic breakdown of a mule — half-assed. Especially for older people who utilize assisted mobility devices such as wheelchairs or walkers, evacuation protocols suggest that just leaving them behind may be the easier way to go. Something as simple as accessible bus ramps could have helped hundreds of older adults evacuate during Hurricane Katrina, given that many emergency shelters were either at capacity or were not accessibility-friendly for incapacitated individuals. These protocols have also failed to prevent instances of abuse and fraud that exponentially increase following a natural disaster. 
At the end of the day, it is unfortunately unsurprising that older people often make up the majority of deaths and victims of post-traumatic stress disorder following natural disasters. Over half of Hurricane Katrina victims were 75 and older. Following the 2008 Great Sichuan Earthquake, PTSD rates among older people increased dramatically compared to that of younger people. In Puerto Rico, many older people with comorbidities were trapped and stranded after hospitals allocated inadequate space for them following Hurricane Maria in 2017.
If adequately developed, evacuation efforts can even reduce the survival chances of older people, and many older adults often refuse to leave their homes given family history or finance-related issues.
Ultimately, we should still develop plans that actually work and actually consider older people’s needs. Let’s educate local communities and allocate resources that support and increase the survival rates of older people in times of crisis. 
Once climate change reaches the breaking point or some apocalyptic event strikes, we might be glad that our grandchildren also included us in the evacuation game plan, thinking, “Back in my day…”

Abortion has never been an uncontroversial topic. Abortion restrictions always seem to be on the horizon, especially in conservative states and during the Trump administration. The ebb and flow of panic about these possible restrictions has become a reliable constant of life in the United States. 
The new abortion law passed in Texas at the beginning of the month, however, signifies a turning point for abortion rights in the United States. Dubbed by NPR as one of the “strictest abortion bans in the country,” the law makes abortion illegal after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo, which is usually at the six-week mark and makes no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. 
Abortion bans’ implications for college students are scarcely explored, but they are particularly salient this time around. College is a time when many students explore their sexualities and engage in casual sexual relationships. 
However, the new abortion restrictions in Texas threaten these habits. According to Prochoice.org, those between the ages of 15 and 19 have about 19% of total abortions, and those aged 20-24 have about 33% of total abortions, showing that college-aged people make up a substantial percentage of those seeking abortions. Without access to safe abortions after the six-week mark, women who get accidentally pregnant will have severely limited options. 
Even if those engaging in casual sexual relationships use contraceptives, the possibility of pregnancy does not disappear. Without the reassurance of abortion care, college students’ mental health may suffer. The American Psychological Association reported that “Women who are denied an abortion are more likely to initially experience higher levels of anxiety, lower life satisfaction and lower self-esteem compared with women who received an abortion.” 
Additionally, a higher volume of unwanted pregnancies will surely affect college students’ relationships with their sexual partners and potentially alter the course of their lives. While we cannot foresee how this will impact the nature of college relationships, we can predict that college students might view sex in a more restrictive way, based on a punctuated fear of what one wrong move with contraception could lead to.
USC, along with other colleges and universities, should provide support for students as a result of this restrictive law, especially for Texan students. They could host forums for students to air their concerns and grievances in the presence of a mental health professional, or they could provide students with the resources to access abortion care in times of crisis. USC already allows for students to get mental health assistance through the “My SHR” portal, where they can schedule telemedicine visits with a professional in a group setting or one-on-one, but these resources may not be specific enough to fit the unique issue at hand.
USC’s obligation to its students is especially pertinent at this time — not only for its reputation but to regain the trust of students, especially female students. The University paid over $1 billion in settlements as a result of the grave misconduct by former gynecologist George Tyndall, who worked at the University for more than 30 years and sexually abused many students as patients. 
The inevitable loss of trust in USC’s healthcare will only be exacerbated if they do not take action now. Through tangible action, the University must show students that it does not take matters related to gynecology lightly. It must be willing to put in the work to make students feel safe and taken care of at Engemann Student Health Center and beyond. 
This abortion restriction in Texas is catastrophic, and its consequences are more far-reaching than many of us can comprehend this soon after its passing. However, for college students, this law will alter the ways in which they view hookup culture and participate in it. For colleges and universities, this law presents an opportunity for them to step up and act as the support systems they claim to be for students.
