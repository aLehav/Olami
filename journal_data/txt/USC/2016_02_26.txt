Fifty years ago, university students at UC Berkeley fought valiantly to uphold and defend the First Amendment; now, it seems a growing trend of college activism threatens to destroy it.
A recent case study involves Ben Shapiro, a Jewish Harvard Law School graduate, editor-at-large of Breitbart and editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire. A local chapter of the Young America’s Foundation club had scheduled Shapiro, a notable conservative journalist who spoke to USC’s College Republicans this past November, to give a talk entitled “When Diversity Becomes a Problem,” at California State University, Los Angeles.
Deciding that a public university receiving taxpayer dollars did not have to abide by the constitutional right to freely speak and assemble, the CSULA president William Covino emailed YAF, canceling Shapiro’s scheduled speech to “arrange for him to appear as part of a group of speakers with differing viewpoints on diversity,” in order to “better represent our university’s dedication to the free exchange of ideas and the value of considering multiple viewpoints.”
Not only is this attempt to expose students to “multiple” viewpoints by shutting them down fallacious, but it also insults the intelligence of the CSULA student body as a whole. Calvino’s ban insinuates that Shapiro’s words will inflict so much emotional damage to his audience, who — mind you, will attend voluntarily — that the administration must unilaterally disregard the First Amendment.
College students today have acquired quite the reputation for being emotionally weak and actively perpetuating their own infantilization. Unfortunately, recent “activism” has justly merited this criticism. While it is warranted for students to protest university policies or laws which they feel inhibit equality of opportunity, this recent trend of a paralyzing fear of words does not bode well for millennials or their futures.
For example, when Milo Yiannopoulos, a gay, conservative journalist and internet provocateur who has also previously spoken at USC, spoke at Rutgers University as a part of his “Dangerous Faggot” tour earlier this month, campus “activists” devolved into small, vaguely racist children, dousing themselves in red paint, storming the speech and chanting war cries, questionably appropriating traditional war ceremonies. During another one of Yiannopoulos’ speeches at the University of Michigan, the university held a group therapy session to counter Yiannopoulos’ “incredibly harmful” rhetoric.
No longer are college activists fighting against wars or laws or any other real instrument of oppression. Instead they are waging an absurd fight against words. This opposition to diversity of thought and speech is so antithetical to the “diversity” that these activists claim to uphold, that it borders between Kafka-esque and straight-up laughable.
No single member of the CSULA community was obligated to attend the talk, nor are any of Shapiro’s followers allowed to actually “directly attack” minority communities, as Jose Castaneda, an organizer of an anti-Shapiro rally, so asserted about the intention of Shapiro’s visit. Per the beauty of free speech, Castaneda and their peers are allowed to offer logical discourse countering Shapiro’s ideas. Instead of fearing words and succumbing to the coddled college student stereotype that threatens to materialize itself in reality, college activists must embrace their own ability to exist in an educated, ideologically diverse and intellectually challenging environment granted by the American college campus. Every American has the ability to voice their opinions, exposing the real fallacies of racism and bigotry, but these societal malaises will never be logically deconstructed if every speaker suspected of touting these beliefs is simply shut down.
Proponents of diversity must protect free speech if they wish to promote a heterogeneous world. After all, free speech, as a constitutional and moral right, does not discriminate
I don’t know that I agree with your claim that college students have garnered a reputation for being “emotionally weak.” If anything, the escalation of inflammatory discourse over a wide range of sources – like social media in addition to on-campus events – has necessitated a greater need for sensitivity.  Words may not be “wars or laws,” but I think that an emphasis on discussion – which is mentioned at the end here, but could definitely be expanded upon – is essential in making students feel safe in an academic setting, especially if the speakers are abrasive figures like Yiannopolous who seem to provoke issues rather than resolve them.  That being said, I think that multiple perspectives are important to a college campus and your focus on free speech is an important one.
Sorry but if words make you feel “unsafe”, you need therapy. What about conservatives or white biological males who get shat on every day? Do they cry about someone else’s words hurting their feelings?? Hell no! They’re just words and someone yelling in your face telling you how bad and privileged a person you are because you may not have any Asian friends or your skin color is too light (uh…racism anyone?) is really just a loud idiot. It’s pretty damn easy to turn your back and walk away.
You say these students aren’t emotionally weak, then you go and claim an “abrasive speaker” doesn’t make students feel safe. Explain your logic there. Words DO NOT equal violence. You could argue that incitement to violence does. But none of the speakers mentioned evenly closely advocate for that. In every speech I’ve seen of theirs that’s published online, they ALWAYS say that you should counter people you disagree with with logical arguments, not threats and intimidation. But how do you feel about the Ferguson protests, hmm? Where Michael Brown’s stepdad said “Burn this bitch down”, inciting rioting and looting. THAT is criminal, yet you only hear Black Lives Matter protestors talk about how Milo or Ben are violent when their own cause is infinitely more violent. Explain that please. 
Democrats hate free speech.
Very good article and spot-on!

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
Like any editor with their section, my co-editor Arya and I devote large chunks of time to the Lifestyle section of the Daily Trojan. We provide arts coverage throughout the campus and Los Angeles, including film, book, restaurant and album reviews, profiles of student and artists, as well as coverage of screening events, plays, exhibits and concerts. We research and send pitches, communicate with writers and designers, edit articles, design layout and write stories when time permits.  
Throughout this semester, the Lifestyle section has accomplished many things that I am proud of. While it is true that the arts and culture section of newspapers is mostly considered a light-hearted beat that provides entertainment, serving as respite from the urgency and seriousness of hard news, it is so much more than that to me. Though I do acknowledge the fact that we do do more fun things –– experiment with relationship issues, go to cool art shows, read books before they come out and attend sold out concerts –– we also get to use our creative and emotional forms of storytelling to spotlight pieces that bring awareness to issues on diversity in media, feminism and cultural inclusivity. Arts writing is so significant to me. Being part of this section has allowed me, especially when I was as a writer, to learn and discover so much about my own creative drive and hone my own voice as both an analytical and imaginative storyteller. Now, I serve as a catalyst to do the same for our writers.
Though I do enjoy the work that I do, it has been very difficult for me in a lot of ways. I recall one of the nights during one of my first few weeks as an editor. I was late to print but my proofs were still covered with questions and corrections smothered in highlighter and multi-colored pen, indicating that wasn’t anywhere near close to printing or finishing.
“What does this mean?” “Un-hyphenate.” “Doesn’t make sense. Change.” “The picture looks blurry.” “Missing a red bar.” “No.”
After looking through every miniscule detail, correcting all the mistakes made in articles and bracing myself prior to telling a writer that the story she worked so hard on can’t make it to production, I felt the weight of all the people I was disappointing, the fear of being disliked by my writers for making decisions out of my control and the burden of being criticized fall on my shoulders and crush me emotionally.
That night as I walked home, I felt like a squawking clarinet messing up the tune in a massive orchestra — it would be way better if I were not here.
I don’t know why I made the connection –– maybe it was because we recently pitched or edited an article related to classical music, but the idea that our paper was like a symphony orchestra suddenly made sense.
When I make mistakes, my cracked notes suddenly become very obvious and disrupt the tune of the whole ensemble. But when I do feel like I’m on top of things, I still feel that my articulation and musicality is drowned out by the grandeur of trumpets and trombones or the virtuosity of soloists. On top of that, the long hours didn’t really help either.
So why I am here and what is my significance?
For the same reason that actors must rehearse the same lines of their monologues over and over; the same reason that ballerina dancers have to repeat the same movements to make it look as if they are effortlessly flying on air on their satin pointe shoes and the same reason that musicians have to practice and listen to the same song a million times in order to execute it once perfectly — everything that I have felt and am feeling is a part of the process. The process is an essential part to the creation of art — as well as anybody who contributes to it. 
The journey of creating something amazing and beautiful is well worth the tedious, mundane and sometimes overwhelming procedure that comes along with it. We are stenographers of Los Angeles and our art is having the honor to showcase artists, musicians, actors and students and make their art and their efforts come alive five times a week, in the middle of the newspaper.
In the metaphorical orchestra that is our student-run newspaper, it is normal for the bass line to feel that they don’t get to contribute as often, the melody to feel drowned out and the one that messes up to feel like they don’t belong or have no significance in the ensemble. But like with music, each section in the paper has its own distinct style and characteristic. The conductor cues us, but we get to add our own dynamics and interpretation. Some sections have more people than others, but we all contribute our own unique and equally important tunes to create one beautiful melody, in harmony with one another. Though it might seem like only first violins get all of the glory, the squawking clarinet and the softest voice of a flute has the ability to add to the compelling and beautiful musical lines. At the end of the day, every single voice and sound deserves be heard and valued.
Whenever I walk past a new restaurant in Downtown, see someone post LACMA’s newest exhibit on Instagram, glance at a movie ad on the street or hear my music major friend tell me that Thornton School of Music is playing a concert next week, I catch myself finding that the first thing that comes to mind is not “I should go!” but rather, “Lifestyle definitely needs to cover this,” and I smile.
I smile because, in the same way art is important to the heart of Los Angeles, the Daily Trojan has become important to mine.

Having lost three of their last four games heading into Thursday night’s action against Stanford, the Trojans did not play like a team desperate to regain ground in a tight Pac-12 conference, falling 84-64 to the Cardinal at Maples Pavilion.
As has been the case in recent games, the Trojans (19-9, 8-7) fell behind early and — unlike the Colorado game — could not recover.
“Stanford played an excellent basketball game,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “They made a lot of shots. In the first half, they shot a high percentage. Some were open, some were contested. Give them credit. They outplayed us and outshot us in the first half.”
In an abysmal first half, USC shot just 25.9 percent from the field with Bennie Boatwright, Nikola Jovanovic, Jordan McLaughlin and Julian Jacobs held to just five combined points on 0-for-15 shooting, and the Trojans trailed 43-25 at halftime. The 25 points were the lowest USC has scored in a half all season.
Enfield’s change in the starting lineup — swapping Elijah Stewart for Katin Reinhardt — made little difference.
“Four of our starters were 0 for 15 at halftime,” Enfield said. “Look, they’ve been playing very good basketball all season. They feel bad; they played hard, but just not well enough tonight. I’ll take the blame for that. I switched the starting lineup up — the starting lineup that I put out there didn’t shoot the ball well, so that’s on me.”
Meanwhile, the Cardinal (14-12, 7-8)  shot it at a 43.3 percent clip in the first half and an even better 46.7 mark from 3-point range. Dorian Pickens recorded 22 points in the half alone and Stanford capitalized for 13 points off seven USC turnovers.
Pickens finished with a career 25 points, while Rosco Allen had 17. Katin Reinhardt’s 14 points led the Trojans.
Stewart noted the Trojans had a game plan for Allen — the 10th leading scorer in the Pac-12 — but instead it was a bench player who did most of the harm.
“[Pickens] got off to a hot start, and he didn’t ever cool off,” Stewart said. “That was crazy. We focused in on Allen, but, unfortunately, he wasn’t the one who went off. It was really frustrating. [Pickens] hit everything tonight.”
The loss moves the all-time USC-Stanford record  to 125-122, but Stanford has now won the last five matchups. USC has not won at Maples Pavilion since Feb. 14, 2013.
“[Stanford] came out and shot the ball really well in the first half,” Reinhardt said. “We couldn’t stop them. They were shooting the crap out of the ball and when a team does that, even though we played very hard, we get beaten. Kudos to them. They played harder than us. That’s how you win games.”
It was a slow offensive start for both teams, with the Trojans starting 1-for-6 and committing three early turnovers while the Cardinal opened 2-for-7. But the action picked up after the first timeout, with the two teams combining to make five 3-pointers in the ensuing minutes. Sophomore guard Elijah Stewart hit a tough shot from beyond-the-arc to give the Trojans a 14-11 lead as they connected on five consecutive shots.
But Stanford went on an 18-4 run to claim a double-digit advantage. Pickens knocked down three 3-pointers in a row; a fourth triple put the Cardinal up 29-18. The Cardinal continued their onslaught as the Trojans allowed open shots and struggled on the offensive end. USC went scoreless for a nearly five-minute stretch while Stanford continued to dominate and expand its lead to as large as 20 at one point.
The second half was more of the same, as the Trojans failed to make any substantial push and the Cardinal maintained their large lead.
The Cardinal’s proficiency on offense prevented the Trojans from playing their preferred, up-tempo pace. USC managed just two fast break points in a half-court style game.
“In order to play a faster tempo, you have to rebound the ball and push it in transition,” Enfield said. “We did that early for a little bit — I think we had a 3-point lead — we got a shot in the lane and a 3 in transition, but we just weren’t stopping them enough in the first half. They made a lot of jump shots and played very good basketball.”
Now sixth in the conference, the Trojans  will travel to Cal to take on the fourth-place Bears on Sunday.

On Wednesday, Forbes ran a story titled “The American Sports Fan at Ten,” in which Henry, a 10-year-old sports fanatic, talks about how his experience following sports.
It got me thinking back to my childhood, how I fell in love with sports and how much the sports landscape has changed since I was in grade school.
I have a theory that our prime sports-watching years are between the ages of 10 and 15, from the time when we gain a general grasp of the world and are introduced to the big domain of sports to around the period where we have to “grow up” and focus on our future. This is the time frame between being a kid and a “mature teen” or adult in which it’s perfectly fine to be naïve and stubborn.
Growing up in the Bay Area, none of my sports teams were very good. Thus, many of my prime sports-watching years were spent rooting for teams that never made the playoffs — or, in the case of the Sharks, always made the playoffs but choked every year. I caught the tail end of the Barry Bonds era with the Giants, but that team was stuck in his shadow and far removed from the World Series juggernaut they are today. The Raiders drafted JaMarcus Russell — widely considered the biggest bust in NFL history — and the 49ers were in the midst of nine straight years without a playoff appearance. The A’s were in a six-year drought themselves, and I would have laughed if you told me as a kid that the Warriors would one day be mentioned in the same breath as the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls.
Thus, my threshold for success as a sports fan was very low. I thought championships were reserved for the teams I always saw leading off SportsCenter like the Lakers, Yankees and Patriots. The greatest success I experienced as a sports fan up until the age of 10 was when the Warriors upset the top-seeded Mavericks in the first round of playoffs in 2007 — before promptly falling in the second round and following it up with five miserable seasons.
And yet, I kept watching, irrationally consumed by the local sports scene — the living room remote might as well have been stuck on the 4-5 cable sports networks.
Nowadays, I am not as devout a sports follower. Obviously, being a sports editor at the Daily Trojan means sports is still a big part of my life, and I still keep up with my teams, but I don’t live or die with every game as I used to. Perhaps it’s because I have less time or because I’ve realized that the world doesn’t revolve around sports, that there are issues and topics in society that are far more important.
There’s also a feeling of nostalgia of the way I followed sports as a naïve 10-year-old. Growing up before the dawn of social media, my news came from refreshing the Yahoo! Sports team sites. High-definition was considered an expensive luxury, and when I wanted to record games, I used something called a VCR cassette.
Today, up-to-the-second news updates are available on Twitter. Scores are refreshed automatically on apps. Can’t make it home to watch the game? No worries—- — just use your smartphone to watch it live anywhere, anytime. Kids these days have it made.
In a similar sense, I feel a strange connection to the players I grew up watching, no matter how bad they were or how good they would become. Case in point: I remember Stephen Curry more for his first few seasons — when he struggling sharing the ball with Monta Ellis, was benched in favor of Acie Law in crunch time by Keith Smart and suffered ankle injury after ankle injury that put his career in jeopardy — than the superstar, revolutionary player he is today.
Believe me, I’m enjoying this Warriors’ historic run as much as anyone else, but for whatever reason, my main sports recollections stem from my early teenage years. The Warriors could win the next five championships and I would still be drawn more to those horrendous teams of the mid-2000s.
This is what happens when an “American Sports Fan at Ten” falls in love with the wrong teams at the wrong time. So, I would urge any 10-year-old kid out there reading this to start rooting for the Warriors. Or the Giants — after all, it is an even year.

The baseball team looks forward to its second three-game series of the season this weekend as the team prepares to welcome Wake Forest to Dedeaux Field. After losing their first two games against North Dakota last week, the Trojans rebounded with a walk-off win in the series’ final game to prevent a sweep, and they survived a late scare to beat Loyola Marymount, 4-3, on Tuesday. USC then played South Korean professional team the NC Dinos Wednesday night, losing 5-0 after shuffling up the lineup for the exhibition game.
Although the team has gotten off to a more sluggish start than anticipated at the start of the season, head coach Dan Hubbs said it was better to work out the kinks earlier in the year.
“I’d rather be 4-0, don’t get me wrong, but I think we’ll be better for it in the long run,” Hubbs said. “We’ve had to deal with some adversity, and we’ve overcome it. Now we just have to continue to play well.”
The Trojans will return to competitive baseball against the Demon Deacons on Friday after their midweek exhibition, but senior outfielder Timmy Robinson said the squad’s attitude is the same regardless of opposition or circumstance.
“We just need to go out there and play our game, so it doesn’t matter whether we’re playing an exhibition game or the No. 1 team in the country,” Robinson said. “We’ll approach this weekend just like we approached the game [against the NC Dinos] … and hopefully the outcome will be different.”
Robinson may finally see a return to the field this weekend after opening the season nursing an injury to his arm and filling the DH spot in the Trojans’ lineup. The Huntington Beach native crushed his first home run of the season on Tuesday, which proved to be the difference in the win against LMU.
Wake Forest comes to Los Angeles sporting a perfect 4-0 record. The Demon Deacons finished the 2015 season with a 27-26 overall record and failed to make the ACC Tournament, but this year, they are unbeaten after home victories over four different teams. They will fly cross-country for their first road games of the season against USC. There is not much familiarity between the two programs, as the Trojans have not faced off against Wake Forest since Rod Dedeaux sat in the dugout as their head coach in the 1949 College World Series.
Hubbs said the key to a strong weekend series and beyond is making sure they play with composure on the field. He pointed to sophomore third baseman Angelo Armenta’s attempt to cut down a runner at home in Wednesday’s exhibition, which led to a 4-run NC inning after the throw arrived too late to the plate.
“We just have to shore up a couple of those kinds of things: that we’re making the right decision and making the right play,” Hubbs said. “If we do that, I think we’ll be in good shape.”
The first game of the series between the Trojans and the Demon Deacons begins at 6 p.m. on Friday at Dedeaux Field. Saturday’s game begins at 2 p.m., and USC will wrap up the three-game set on Sunday at 1 p.m.

This weekend marks the end of the regular season for the women’s basketball team as it faces off against two Arizona teams in an effort to improve its postseason seeding. At 6-10, the Women of Troy  are currently ranked eighth in the Pac-12 going into a weekend against NCAA No. 9 Arizona State.
The first game of the weekend will be a challenge for the Trojans, as they rematch against Arizona State, a team they nearly toppled earlier this season. Both teams were neck-and-neck the whole game, with USC taking an early lead before ASU pulled back to a tie at the half. The game came down to the wire, with ASU forward Sophie Brunner converting a 3-point play to take a 1-point lead.
In the final seconds, USC made a buzzer-beater shot to take the lead, but the referee called off the play. The game’s ending was bitter for the team, and heading into Friday the players will be ready for redemption on their home court. Despite a disparity in rankings, the players feel that they have an even shot at taking down the No. 9-ranked team on Friday.
“We played an amazing game, and at the end of the day, it wasn’t anything we did,” associate head coach Beth Burns said. “They made the play. Now though, they know what we can do, we’re on their radar, and they’re going to bring their very best against us.”
Sunday’s game will be an easier matchup for the Trojans, as they take on the unranked Arizona Wildcats at home. Ranked eleventh in the conference, the Wildcats have only notched two wins in their Pac-12 season, against bottom-ranked Colorado and California. Earlier in the season, the Trojans bounced back from a slow start to handle Arizona 67-57 on the road.
It was in that game three weeks ago that junior point guard Courtney Jaco saw her shooting come alive again. Formerly the key shooting guard for the team, two academic ineligibilities forced Jaco to take on the role of the point guard, a position she had never filled before. This resulted in her taking on more of a leadership position for the team, changing the way she handles the ball and fits into the offense.
Although Jaco has come alive as a leader in the point position, the switch has slowed her ability to heat up from behind the 3-point line as her position forces her to assist and drive. In the previous game against Arizona, however, Jaco found her rhythm behind the line, dropping four 3-point shots and a total of 24 points to lead the Trojans for a from-behind lead. Now, Jaco will be called upon to lead her team in a defining weekend as the Trojans look to prepare for the postseason.
“We want this as much as any team could want it,” Jaco said. “We know that these are two games that we can win, that we have the ability to win this weekend but we have to play together, as a team, to win as a team.”
