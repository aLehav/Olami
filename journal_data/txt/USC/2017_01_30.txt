A new app made by Trojan alumni looks to ease people’s addiction to their apps. 
Ramsay Brown, T. Dalton Combs, Vince Enachescu and Akash Desai created Space to encourage a healthier relationship between mobile devices and users. 
Brown graduated with a master’s degree in neuroinformatics in 2015, while Enacheschu and Combs earned doctoral degrees in neuroscience and neuroeconomics, respectively, in 2016. Desai completed a bachelor’s degreee in computer engineering in 2015.
The team makes up Dopamine Labs, a group of scientists in Venice, Calif. The app works by loading a pause before opening an actual application.
While Space is currently free on iOS Safari and will hit the Android market in the near future, it is unavailable on the iOS App Store. 
According to Brown, Apple denied Space a position in the app store “on the grounds that an app that encourages people to use their iPhone or other apps less is inappropriate for the App Store.” 
“If you are bored, angry, hungry, stressed, there’s an app that has been explicitly designed to be your little band-aid,” Brown said. “They are designing it in a way though, that doesn’t give you freedom of choice. They are all competing to be your habit and your addiction, and they talk about it very explicitly.”
Team members at Dopamine Labs explained that the brain will continue a certain behavior until it reaches an end point. For example, the feed never ends in Instagram’s infinite scroll and Netflix’s 10-second countdown to the next episode. There is no reason to stop engaging in the application’s activities. 
According to Dopamine Labs, human brains establish associative behaviors. When a consumer receives positive feedback from an app such as Snapchat or Instagram, brain synapses involved with addiction enlarge. Space aims to break down the connection in enlarged synapses. When an app delays and a user fails to immediately receive a surge of information, the brain’s natural mechanisms shrink those connections due to its delayed response. 
Dopamine Labs has an application program interface unrelated to Space, which attempts to increase app addiction. To create Space, the team took the same math and principles of the Dopamine API and ran them in reverse. The result is that consumers became un-addicted to the app. Now, anybody could reclaim control from an application they feel dependent on through Space. 
By giving the user a new app icon instead of the original one, Space immediately adds a moment of zen to the subconscious when on the home screen. 
Dopamine Labs uses artificial intelligence to modify the breathing delay by monitoring the user’s recovery time from the app. This “calm barrier” to the original app allows the brain to unhook from the detriments of app addiction and aids in giving control back to the user, rather than the app. 
According to Brown, addiction to mobile applications can be like a nicotine addiction. Brown said that app developers use more money, more math and more research to hook people, which is analogous to cigarettes.
“Cigarettes aren’t just bad because they hurt you — they’re bad because they rob you of choice,” Brown said. “They’re designed to be smoked compulsively. In the same way, these technologies are designed to make you chemically crave technology.”

On Monday, USC’s Department of Political Science hosted Jennifer Gandhi, a professor of political science at Emory University, to present her latest research paper on authoritarian regimes. 
Gandhi is one of the foremost experts in the field of elections under authoritarian regimes, and how authoritarian regimes can use multi-party elections to improve both their social and political capital. 
“Authoritarian governments use a menu of manipulation to play at holding multi-party elections, all the while having no intention of giving up power,” Gandhi said in the preface to her lecture. 
Her latest research focuses on how authoritarian regimes attempt to consolidate power into one ruling party in multi-party elections through the manipulation of electoral rules before an election. Most notably, this was the case with Russia and the 2016 election, which was moved from December to September, and saw the government very visibly switch the electoral system from a closed-list proportional representation to a mixed single-member district plurality, under which Russia operated from 1993 to 2003. This was the second such switch in electoral rules under President Vladimir Putin, who also presided over the switch from the mixed system in 2003 to a fully closed list proportional representation system right before the 2007 Duma, or general assembly, elections. 
Professor Gandhi focused on how this change in rules, while beneficial for the ruling party to consolidate its power and gain supermajorities in the legislative bodies of autocracies, can actually create “potential losers” within the ruling party. This refers to members of the ruling party who won their seats through the single-member district plurality system, which involved direct election from small, regional districts, now having to compete in the larger, less regional districts of the fully closed-list proportional system to which Russia switched over in 2007. These incumbents have a higher chance of losing their seats, which can lead to a disgruntled class of displaced elites that provide a real and tangible danger to the autocrat’s power and control over the nation. 
“Changes in the electoral rules can increase aggregate gains but also alienate some individual members [of the ruling party],” Gandhi said. 
She showed the electoral data from the switch of Russian electoral systems from 2003 to 2007. 
The argument that Professor Gandhi made is that, in order to both consolidate power and keep elites happy in authoritarian regimes, dictators must manage the tension of “prospective losers” by compensating them with political appointments or an electoral boost. 
However, according to Gandhi, the autocrat runs into problems, since the appointed positions are presumably already occupied by party cronies or other elites that the autocrat wishes to keep content. Thus, in order to accommodate everyone, new positions must be created, expanding the bureaucratic system of the autocratic nation.
“Autocrats expand the pie to compensate potential losers,” said about Gandhi explained her research’s most important concept, providing a series of statistics to show how cabinets and appointed positions increase in autocratic societies following an electoral rule change.

Students and researchers at USC’s Spatial Science Institute are helping Los Angeles officials address crime in the city using data and location services. 
The project, titled “A Spatial Analysis of Street-level Crime Trends in L.A,” focuses on exploring how the locations of crimes are related to social and built environments using GeoHub, a mapping platform that shows location-based data. Variables such as the unemployment rate or the proximity of street lights in the immediate area are recorded so viewers can analyze correlations between environmental characteristics and where crimes are actually committed.
The idea behind the study is that law enforcement can use this information to deploy patrols and utilize their resources more effectively.
In one example, observers can take note of the time of day and day of the week a crime took place, as well as whether it occurred near a school, liquor store or Metro stop. By identifying these patterns, police departments can adjust the way they deploy officers to deter crime.
The study was spearheaded by postdoctoral research associate Noli Brazil and Geographic Information System project specialist Beau MacDonald, while undergraduates Izzy Mitchell, Richard Windisch, Kyra Schoonover, Robin Franke and Leonard Ngo and spatial informatics master’s student Yuqing Qian also contributed.
In December, the group presented this project to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s data team and the Los Angeles Police Department. Several major Los Angeles public officials and collaborators with the mayor’s office attended the presentation, including Garcetti’s chief data officer Lilian Coral, data fellow Sari Ladin and policy director for public safety Brian Buchner. Arnold Suzukamo, a GIS specialist at the LAPD, also attended.
“We were so impressed with the high quality of work that the Spatial Sciences Institute has done,” Buchner said, according to USC News. “They have brought us an innovative approach that will be tremendously useful as the mayor’s office, LAPD and other city stakeholders work to develop policies and strategies to improve community safety.”

The Women’s March in Los Angeles brought thousands of people to the streets of Downtown on Jan. 21. As protesters rallied for women’s rights, however, it was the posters that received attention. “Not my president,” “My rights are not for grabs” and “Ladies, let’s get in formation” were just a few of the sayings emblazoned on the posters.
Now, the USC Special Collections Library is working to collect these posters, in addition to flyers, hats and other remnants from the protest to preserve in its archives.
Susan Luftschein, the head librarian of Special Collections, explained why the department decided to start the collection and archive. 
“We thought it was important to document this event, not only because it was a historic event but also because it took place here in Los Angeles,” Luftschein said. “And one of our collective strengths is on Los Angeles and the history of Southern California.”
Luftschein said that Special Collections is not currently planning on putting the archived objects up for display, but this is a desired objective. The department wants to give visual representation to the political activity occurring and to help foster even more of it at USC. 
The Special Collections department has been taking in packages filled with posters, pins and hats, all of which are elements representative of the event that occurred on Jan. 21. Michaela Ullmann, a librarian of the department, curates the submissions. 
“For me personally, since I’ve been the one who gets to interact with all these people who are sending posters, it’s interesting because they are also submitting stories,” Ullmann said. “Often times it’s not just getting a poster but also getting a background story.”
According to Ullmann, there is a broader context to the signs when the people are the backstory behind the signs. The range of people who participated in the march is then expanded.
One contributor was a survivor of cancer, while another submitted a poster saying her two daughters had made their submitted poster. 
Jessica Brier, a Ph.D. candidate for art history, gave further insight to the importance of collecting posters from the Women’s March.
“I would say that ephemera that comes from an event like the Women’s March gives a kind of lasting sense of something that is really hard to recreate or a memory that these things did exist,” Brier said.
According to Brier, the posters preserve the messages and highlight the current political climate many people hope to address. The creativity brought to the posters shows just how inspired people were by political activism at the march. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, the Women’s March was expected to be one the largest post-inauguration demonstrations in history. The trinkets from the march became novelties, reminders of the march’s image as people flooded the streets of downtown LA to peacefully protest what they believed to be unjust, Brier said.
“The L.A. Women’s March becomes a symbol of a wider movement,” Brier said. “These posters and ephemera from the march became emblems of the movement.”
Daphne Armstrong, a freshman majoring in international relations, participated in the Women’s March and donated her poster to the library. 
“It’s wonderful that the library is preserving the message and feelings of the march embodied by these signs,” Armstrong said. “It gives our effort that much more validity. I hope these signs remind and inspire us to keep fighting for equality and standing up for what is right.”
Posters are being accepted by the Special Collections department on the second floor of Doheny Library.
That’s an I threshing way to collect the trash. The Womens March participants left tons of trash behind for others to pick up.  And speaking of historic events, will the USC linr a rise also include signs from the the Womens Pro Life March from last week, too?

Students gathered to learn from internationally acclaimed pianist Barry Snyder on Monday in the Newman Recital Hall. Introduced as a “musician’s musician” by Professor Antoinette Perry, Snyder’s music was described as “nothing short of ravishing.” Snyder brings his talents to USC to share his expertise with aspiring pianists. 
The event began at 10 a.m. Michelle Do, a graduate student in the doctor of musical arts program, was the first performer for Snyder. She handed Snyder her the music selection, took a seat at the first of two Steinway pianos in the recital hall and began to play. 
The piece chosen was Sonata in D major Op. 40 No. 3 by British composer Muzak Clementi. For 10 minutes, Do played as Snyder observed her from the sixth row; when her selection came to a close, Snyder took a seat at the second Steinway and began sharing his advice, playing along with Do to help communicate his words of wisdom. After about 25 minutes of workshopping her piece, Snyder thanked Do and invited the next player to take the stage. 
A total of four pianists showcased their skills in the masterclass: Michelle Do, Ah-Kyung Woo, Alin Malik-Adamyan, and Wesley Chu. Each played six to ten minutes from pieces by renowned composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn and Sergei Prokofiev. In return, they received about 20 minutes of one-on-one teaching from the esteemed Barry Snyder. 
Barry Snyder’s prestige dates back to the 1966 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, where he won three awards: the Silver Medal, Pan American Union Award and Chamber Music Prize. Since then, his popularity has continually climbed, making him one of the most sought-after piano teachers in the field, according to the book The Most Wanted Piano Teacher. 
Snyder has performed and taught globally; he even juried for the World International Piano Competition in Cincinnati and the Glasgow Young Artists Competition. He is now a professor of piano at the Eastman School of Music, a prestigious music school in Rochester, New York. The caliber of his teaching has earned him respect from the professional community, prompting him to share his teaching through master classes all over the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Upon reflecting on his teaching inspirations, Barry Snyder cited his past mentors. 
“I had a teacher, a wonderful teacher, who dedicated herself to teaching … now that I think about it, if you’re a giving person, teaching is about a willingness to give,” Snyder said.
Sharing his personal insight not only encourages aspiring musicians, but it also helps Snyder learn more about his art form. 
“It gives me better insights into music,” Snyder said. “If you’re thinking for someone else, you are removed from your emotions, and when you try something with a student, you might find yourself doing the same thing at home.”
The event was organized by Antoinette Perry, a keyboard studies professor at the USC Thornton School of Music. As a long-time friend of Snyder, Perry managed to organize the master class before Snyder’s appearance at the San Francisco Conservatory.
Wesley Chu, the final performer of the class, spoke about the benefits he saw in participating in workshops like this. 
“As artists, it’s important to seek out new perspectives, even if you don’t agree,” Chu said. “It’s always helpful.”

Of all art forms, ancient and contemporary, sculpture has the longest and most enduring capacity for memory and representation. No one understands this sentiment better than celebrated sculptor Murray “Mac” Dewart, a Boston-based artist, scholar and editor of Poems About Sculpture, a collection of poems, spanning regions and eras, about the eternal nature of sculpture.
On Monday, Dewart spoke at Wallis Annenberg Hall about the influence of American landscape and history on the art of sculpture. The event — in a collaboration between the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Roski School of Art and Design and Fisher Museum of Art — was replete with a complimentary lunch and attended by students and scholars. 
Dewart was invited to speak at the request of Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III. Since Wilson was away on business, his wife, Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Professor Francille Wilson, addressed the crowd and welcomed Dewart to USC.
“To call Mac a Renaissance man is an understatement of his great and searching mind,” Wilson said. “He has an intensely curious mind.” 
After Wilson’s introduction, Dewart took the floor with a copy of his new book in hand and began to speak.
“I’m going to talk about three things,” Dewart said. “I’m going to talk about how [the American] landscape has awakened the imaginations of poets and of sculptors, how the tools we use are critical to what it is we accomplish and how the cultural interface happens as cultures — from the East, West, North, South — impact this continent.” 
Through a series of photographs, Dewart illustrated a narrative of the evolution of American culture as documented through sculpture. Observing the bronze George Washington sculpture standing in the Boston Public Garden, Dewart saw a reflection of the American revolutionary struggle and evidence of America’s displacement of native populations. 
He made a case for the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor as a manifestation of the enlarged American sense of individual liberty as well as an emblem of the model generosity deeply entrenched in the American vision. And he interpreted Mount Rushmore as a symbol of the American tendency to romanticize the past in its retrospective celebration of political figures. 
“Artisans and sculptors — we give the world metaphors,” Dewart said. “If you can get three metaphors into a sculpture, you’re doing well. Sculpture is a balance between poetry and engineering; too much engineering and it’s boring, too much poetry and it tips over, falls down, falls apart, doesn’t last.” 
Dewart noted the importance of early and frequent failures, crediting his failure as a novelist in college as the catalyst for his sculpting career. 
“I began making sculptures my last year at Harvard College because I’d always loved working with my hands, and I understood that there was something important about sculpture,” Dewart said. 
Since then, he found great professional success, and his independent works have been installed in major public gardens around the globe, including in his hometown of Cambridge, Mass. and Beijing, China. 
Most recently, Dewart collaborated with acclaimed poet Robert Pinsky to publish Poems About Sculpture, a unique poetry collection that examines the relationship between the two art forms. 
“Poetry and sculpture are not linked in time, unlike novels and movies,” Dewart said. “Sculptures are instantaneously visible and experienced [in the moment], and poetry has a spiritual dimension that’s related to that.”

On Jan. 29, museums from all across Southern California banded together to host their 12th annual Museum Free-For-All day, a day where over 30 museums in the area offered free admission. Amid the iconic exhibits throughout Los Angeles lies a gem that may not have made it onto Instagram feeds alongside the abundance of Los Angeles County Museum of Art posts — the Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video exhibit at the Craft and Folk Art Museum.
According to the CAFAM website, Focus Iran 2 intends to feature a spectrum of artists’ photography and video works depicting Iranian culture and heritage. The exhibition opened on Saturday night, presented in collaboration with the Farhang Foundation, and will be on display until May 7.
The contributing artists come from every corner of the world, representing countries like the United States, the Netherlands and Iran itself. While the exhibition juror panel initially received 287 submissions, they managed to narrow it down to the 42 inspiring works that are hanging on the walls of the CAFAM today.
Each piece of work provides aspects of insight into the raw aspects of Iranian life, from looking deeper at the hijab to real stories of migration to details of citizens’ day-to-day life. As opposed to just looking at exceptional photographs of the nation’s beauty — as many photography exhibits tend to portray —  this collection aims to expose the lies that plague the country while veraciously illustrating the truth of Iranian history and art.
“Every person has their own interpretation of art, and what’s beautiful and something really interesting about this one is it doesn’t just show what people convey as beautiful,” museum visitor Wendy Young said. “It shows things that people would think are more ugly rather than just the pretty portraits and old statues and stuff. This stuff is more ‘now.’ It’s more ‘now’ than the contemporary museum in my opinion and it’s just really cool to see.”
Lining the walls of museum, the artworks also featured the personal commentary of artists contributing to the exhibit.
“When I read the history of my land, its literature and its visual arts, I imagine it as colorful and lovely,” satirist Mehrdad Afsari said in the description accompanying his photograph “Memories of Desolation.”“They are full of sharp, joyous colors, signifying the happiness of the times. These images, takenin Iran’s central plateau, describe the present-day status of my homeland and what is left of it: desolation, replete with silence and dread.” 
Exhibits like Focus Iran 2 play a crucial role in the local and national discussion on immigration today. They assist in providing more information on other cultures and expose visitors to new ideas which they may not have known about beforehand.
“This is really important because especially with Trump being our president and everything that he’s been doing lately and how it’s been, he’s been really trying to separate us — it’s basically us against them,” museum visitor Brandi Douglas said. “He’s created a lot of hate crimes, and there’s so much fear going on right now too, so it is very important to look at exhibits like this and see that everyone’s still a living person. You know, they have emotions and feelings, and everyone deserves to be here.”
Admissions assistant Marisela Norte said that due to the attraction gained from the Museum Free-For-All Day, the CAFAM hosted over 1,500 visitors on Sunday. 
On Feb. 11, CAFAM will also be hosting a free juror and artist discussion, followed by a reception for Focus Iran 2, where an all-female panel of exhibiting artists will discuss their views on their art and Iranian life.

People are literally born with the ability to run. As exhausting as running a few miles sounds, the most difficult part of the sport is actually the mental aspect. Sure, there are no plays and no rules to memorize, but it does require strategy, mental toughness and above all, the ability to fend off boredom.
That last one is perhaps the biggest obstacle for beginners, whether they are completely new to running or new to a longer distance race. When I signed up for marathon team, the biggest challenge was finding a way to distract myself during long runs, which could last up to three, or four, or even five hours. Like most people, I started off with music. I made playlists of every upbeat song I knew and pounded pavement to the sound of pop music. That was fine for the first hour-long run.
The next week, the marathon team added a mile onto the long run. It was only an additional 10 minutes or so, but by the time the initial hour was over, I was sick of the same songs and running in general. I yanked my earbuds out for the last 10 minutes, choosing boredom over beat drops.
After that, I tried to create a new playlist every week. That was just unrealistic. I’m picky about new music. It takes me a few listens to be convinced. At that time, I hadn’t even broken down to get premium Spotify yet, so music discovery was a time-consuming and usually fruitless endeavor that only got harder as the marathon team continued to increase mileage.
On a whim, I decided to try listening to podcasts instead of my overplayed tunes. The first season of Serial has just come out. I was curious about all the hype surrounding a real-life murder mystery that unfolds through a series of audio episodes. Well, to be honest, I was curious about the hype and the audio storytelling format, not so much about the actual crime investigation. I’m definitely not a CSI-watching, Pretty Little Liars-reading, murder mystery enthusiast.
But what I’ve found is that a good story is a good story, no matter what topic it’s about. 
I set off on my run with the Serial theme music in my ears and promptly lost track of the many miles ahead. Listeners are introduced in the first episode to Adnan Sayed, a man serving a prison life sentence for the murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. The pair were both seniors in high school at the time of her murder, and Adnan claims he was wrongly convicted. 
I spent much of that run forming my own opinion of Adnan. Instead of teasing myself with thoughts of what I would eat and how good my nap would be later, I could focus on something else, on a suspect, on evidence that didn’t make sense. It wasn’t until I started listening to podcasts while running that I realized how much a person’s voice conveys.
I strained to identify the truth in Adnan’s voice. He sounds genuine, but also a little too nonchalant about the murder. With nothing else for my brain to do, I became an attentive listener and story analyzer. My run ended abruptly when the miles ran out and I hadn’t once thought about the time or my tired muscles.
Undoubtedly, Serial became the running buddy that got me through marathon training. I listened to one or two episodes every week, and as I got closer to the marathon, I also thought I was getting closer to figuring out the truth of the murder. I won’t spoil it, but I will say that a mental and physical workout was great preparation for a 26.2 mile race.
These days, I’m training for a half-marathon with a few different podcasts downloaded. No matter whether I am having a slow or fast day, I can go my own pace with a podcast because there is no pressure to keep up with the beat of the music. Podcasts are also completely free and a great way to learn something new. With literally thousands of podcasts on every topic imaginable, there’s no need to fear boredom; there’s a reason to look forward to running.

The No. 2 women’s water polo team continued its hot start to the 2017 season by posting a pair of convincing wins over Concordia University and Whittier College at the CBU Mini Invitational over the weekend.
The Trojans (7-0) traveled out to the Inland Empire for Saturday’s doubleheader and made sure to bring their firepower with them, outscoring both opponents by a whopping 50-5 combined margin. When it was all said and done, 15 different players found the back of the net for USC, with seven of those players recording hat tricks. The team was led by the reigning MPSF Player of the Week, senior driver Stephania Haralabidis, who scored eight goals across the two games. The pair of victories also bumped USC’s winning streak to 34 games in a row, dating back to the 2015 postseason. 
In the first game of the tournament, USC took on the Concordia Eagles (1-1) and raced out to an 11-1 lead by the end of the opening period. Twelve different Trojans scored in the game, and 17 unanswered goals the rest of the way helped secure the 28-1 victory. USC was led by four goals apiece from freshman utility Maud Megens and senior driver Ioanna Haralabidis, while freshman driver Elise Stein and senior All-Americans Brigitta Games and Stephania Haralabidis added hat tricks. In just three periods of work, sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Longan recorded 12 saves, while freshman Holly Parker came in the fourth frame and logged two saves.
The Trojans remained in the pool to square off against the Division III Whittier Poets (0-2). It was more of the same offensive onslaught for USC, as the Trojans poured in 11 straight goals and held Whittier scoreless in the first half en route to the 22-4 victory. Junior goalkeeper Victória Chamorro recorded five saves in three periods, while Parker once again came on in relief in the fourth quarter to tally one save.
Stephania Haralabidis had the hot hand and chipped in a game-high five goals, followed by Games’ four goals and freshman driver Denise Mammolito’s hat trick. Two more freshmen drivers would get in on the action as well, as Alaina Cousineau scored her first-ever pair of goals in Cardinal and Gold against the Poets, while Sawyer Belville added another goal to close out the win.
The reigning national champions remain undefeated heading into their home opener against No. 15 San Diego State (1-1) this Friday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The Trojans’ match against the Aztecs will begin at 5 p.m.

Redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week on Monday. Aaron earned the award after leading the Trojans in scoring during their upset victory over then-No. 8 UCLA last Wednesday.
The 21-year-old is currently playing his first season at USC, after transferring to Troy from Louisville in 2015 and sitting out the 2015-16 season, and he came off the bench against the Bruins to rack up a career-high 23 points, including three of the Trojans’ program-record 14 baskets from 3-point range. He added four rebounds and one assist to round out his stat line.
Aaron’s breakout performance impressed many — and most importantly for a bench player, it impressed head coach Andy Enfield.
“Aaron was spectacular tonight,” Enfield said on Wednesday. “It was his best game.”
Aaron is the second Trojan on the men’s basketball team to receive Pac-12 Player of the Week honors this season: Junior guard Jordan McLaughlin won the award in December for his tournament-MVP performance at the Las Vegas Classic. Before this season, USC had not had a men’s basketball Player of the Week in three years, the last being junior guard Elijah Stewart back in 2014.
After the Trojans’ fourth consecutive victory over their crosstown rivals, Aaron will now look to force himself into even more playing time among USC’s talented guard corps. He averages just under 23 minutes per game to this point, but he played 26 minutes against the Bruins. And Aaron was ready to get right back to work on Wednesday night, taking a basketball into the postgame press conference.
“I’m about to go shoot,” he said.
Aaron’s next chance to impress comes against Washington, as the Trojans head out to Seattle for another Wednesday night tilt. With sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright nearing a return from his long-term knee injury, there could be even less playing time to go around, but Aaron will take confidence from his coach’s comments.
“What impresses me with Aaron is he keeps getting better. We have a lot of confidence in him,” Enfield said. “It was just a matter of time.”
Tip-off against the Huskies will be at 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Aaron and the Trojans will then head for Pullman, Wash. to take on Washington State on Saturday.

USC men’s tennis continued its undefeated start to the season over the weekend, winning the ITA Kick-Off Weekend championship with victories over East Tennessee State and San Diego. The No. 8 Trojans hosted the tournament at Marks Stadium, and they took advantage of their home court in their opening match against the Buccaneers and the championship matchup versus the Toreros.
ETSU was USC’s first opponent of the weekend, and the Trojans cruised to a 4-0 sweep on Saturday. Senior Nick Crystal and sophomore Laurens Verboven teamed up to get the match off to a fast start with a 6-1 win over the Buccaneers’ Robert Herrerra and Diego Nuñez. Junior Thibault Forget and sophomore Jack Jaede picked up a 6-2 victory not long after to clinch the doubles point for USC.
Jaede then took his momentum into singles play, recording a 6-1, 6-2 win and doubling the Trojans’ advantage on the scoreboard. Freshman Riley Smith won his match 6-4, 6-2 to put USC one point away from advancing to the championship, and Crystal’s 6-4, 6-1 victory punched the Trojans’ ticket.
San Diego met USC in the final on Sunday after defeating Virginia Tech before the Trojans took the court against ETSU. USC dominated in doubles play, with Smith and freshman Brandon Holt easing to a 6-2 win to kick things off. Senior Rob Bellamy and sophomore Jake DeVine then got the Trojans on the board with another 6-2 victory.
Crystal grabbed the first point in singles play, beating the Toreros’ Josh Page 6-1, 6-3, before Holt put USC up 3-0 with a 6-2, 6-3 win. Smith clinched the championship with a 6-1, 6-3 victory, and the Trojans took home a 6-1 win over San Diego once the rest of the matches were played to completion.
In the remainder of games, sophomore Logan Smith battled back from an 0-2 deficit to win 6-2, 6-4, and Jaede edged a three-set match 6-0, 3-6, 6-3. DeVine came up short in the only Trojan loss over the weekend, falling to Joel Gamerov. DeVine battled through multiple tiebreakers, losing one in the first set and another in the decisive final set. Despite putting up a tough fight, DeVine ultimately fell 7-6 (3), 3-6, 1-0 (10-3). 
USC is now 5-0 overall on the season, but the team has yet to play away from the friendly confines of Marks Stadium. The Trojans will go on the road for the first time this year for their next matchup, as they travel to Gainesville, Fla. for the Pac-12/SEC Showdown. They will take on hosts Florida on Saturday and Georgia on Sunday.

It’s pretty incredible to think that we are now over four weeks removed from redshirt junior kicker Matt Boermeester’s 46-yard Rose Bowl-winning field goal that split the uprights as time expired against the Penn State Nittany Lions. It’s also crazy to think that it’s time to stop celebrating the win in Pasadena and start looking to the future, as we are on the eve of one of the most important dates on the USC football calendar: National Signing Day.
College football is a monster — a restless beast. Pull off one of the biggest wins in program history (like USC did), take what feels like a 20-minute nap and then get back out on the recruiting trail to reel in the prospects who will get you back to another Rose Bowl Trophy — and hopefully beyond. 
The Trojans entered this recruiting season with several gaping holes on their roster. There’s the harsh reality that the junior duo of receiver Juju Smith-Schuster and Thorpe Award-winning defensive back and All-American Adoree’ Jackson will not be returning to the team next season. USC must also combat a big loss with the graduation of its Rose Bowl MVP, senior nose tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu, this offseason. An already-thin Trojan defensive line gets thinner next season as redshirt junior defensive tackle Khaliel Rodgers and sophomore Noah Jefferson will be transferring to different programs. USC will also be losing a pair of key senior linebackers to graduation in team captain Michael Hutchings and rotational player Quinton Powell.
In response to these departures, USC has done a commendable job of filling in some positional gaps before the arrival of signing day on Wednesday. On occasion, it has felt like the Trojans are capitalizing on their Rose Bowl victory by using it as a valuable pitch to recruits. 
USC made major noise in the recruiting world last week when it received a commitment from the No. 1-rated defensive tackle in the class of 2017, Marlon Tuipulotu. A native of Oregon, Tuipulotu was a longtime commit to Washington. But days after taking an official visit to Los Angeles, he announced on Twitter that he would be joining the Trojans’ football program. 
USC has also been able to pick up a pair of solid pieces in its defensive backfield. At the Army All-American Bowl, four-star defensive back Bubba Bolden verbally committed to the Trojans. Last Friday, Under Armour All-American safety Isaiah Pola-Mao, a four-star recruit, committed to USC as well. There will never be a sufficient replacement when you lose a weapon like Adoree’ Jackson, but these two secondary pickups are solid ones for the Trojans. 
USC already has four mid-year early enrollees on campus this semester: five-star long snapper Damon Johnson, four-star linebacker Tayler Katoa, four-star quarterback Jack Sears and four-star offensive lineman Andrew Vorhees. Sears was, in fact, the replacement for USC’s standout redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold at San Clemente High School. Sears led the Tritons to a CIF State Title in his senior season in 2016. Who’s for renaming USC the “University of San Clemente” someday? 
Well, now that I have scratched the surface of USC’s affairs heading into signing day, please allow me to grind my gears on another facet of the big day Wednesday: social media and the online world of football recruiting. Intertwining social media platforms and the personal accounts of top prospects has changed the face of college football recruiting forever. 
It’s always been remarkable to me the lengths that some 30- and 40-something-year-olds on Twitter will go to try and persuade (a better word here is “harass”) some recruits — who are likely the age of their own children, or younger — into signing with their school of choice. 
Hey, @RollTide150, I’ve got some breaking news for you: Tweeting excessively at a 16- or 17-year-old high school athlete will not attract them to your school. If anything, it is actually a repellent to them. 
This phenomenon was on display when Tuipulotu announced his commitment to USC last week. Tuipulotu’s announcement-tweet was attached to an open letter, in which he asked fans to “respect his decision.” Leave it to Twitter to disrespect the decision of a young man who has worked hard his entire life and has the rightful option to attend whichever school he likes. As mentioned, Tuipulotu was a long-time Washington commit, so Dawgs fans were sure to voice their disapproval of his decommitment online. 
From calling Tuipulotu “disloyal” to wishing him a bad experience as a Trojan, the replies to the standout defensive tackle’s announcement-tweet were pretty shameful. I cover the USC football team for the Daily Trojan, so I am always doing what I can to stay up to date on happenings with the team. Browsing popular USC sites is always helpful, and occasionally, I’ll find myself on an online message board concerning Trojan football. 
When I browse through many of USCFootball.com’s public discussion forums, I see hundreds of online users debating and speculating over the status of a 15-year-old recruit — whose own signing day is some three years away. Very few ever have the opportunity to experience what I imagine can be the unique and  amazing experience of being a highly-touted football recruit. So much speculation surrounds their every move and hint of commitment. Those in-home visits must be pretty rad, right? Who wouldn’t want to host charming Trojan head coach Clay Helton at their dinner table as he peppers you with compliments and sincere promises? If only. 
But to college recruits: Be sure to turn off the notifications on your Twitter mobile app when you seal your college fate and sign on the dotted line on signing day. You never know who is going to cast negative energy on your future, degrade your ability as a player or even wish death upon your dog.

President Donald Trump’s administration announced earlier this month that one of the administration’s first intended budget cuts will slash funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts. These two endowments constitute just 0.006 percent of the 2016 federal budget. Despite being such a minimal portion of overall national spending, these two foundations have substantively advanced the role of art in society. Projects including summer programs for teachers, student focus on topics such as Muslim American identities and existentialism, various research programs and initiatives to preserve American history have all been funded by the NEH and NEA. But above all, eliminating these grants is detrimental to the education system and sends the false message that that it is not worth it to invest in the arts and humanities.
This issue hits close to home for the University. In May 2015, USC’s Game Innovation Lab received two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. One of the grants, awarded to Professor Tracy Fullerton, funded the development of Walden, A Game, an interactive look at Thoreau’s novel. Without funding like this, many universities would be unable to fund research and creative projects. Though higher education funding has more elasticity and sources than lower education, universities will still be negatively impacted by the sudden nature of this budget cut. The ethos of higher education is focused on research and innovation and is deeply contradicted by cutting these endowments. The effect on taxpayers is miniscule, while the positive community impact of research and projects pertaining to arts and humanities in education is immense. 
On top of hurting higher education and university research and funding, these budget cuts will also be deeply detrimental to public lower education. Eliminating the resources that these funds provide will have serious consequences on our education system. A 2011 study by the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities showed that “students who were involved in arts education for at least nine hours a week were four times more likely to have high academic achievement and three times more likely to have high attendance.” Another study conducted by the National Educational Longitudinal Survey stated that “low-income students involved in band and orchestra outscored others on the NELS math assessment; low-income students involved in drama showed greater reading proficiency and more positive self-concept compared to those with little or no involvement.” 
Additionally, a cut in this endowment could disproportionately affect low-income and minority households. According to another study done in 2008, black and Hispanic students are already two times less likely to have access to art programs in their school districts in comparison to their white peers. Research by the NEA shows that 71 percent of students of low socioeconomic status who participated in the arts, compared to 48 percent of low-income students without access to publicly funded arts programs, attended college after high school. 
Like many of the recent proposed tax cuts on education, defunding the NEH and NEA will have little to no tangible effects on wealthy, majority white neighborhoods, as the arts can be privately funded. However, these endowment programs are essential to low-income and minority students for funding drama, music and visual arts programs and developing crucial humanities curricula. Defunding these endowments will only serve to exacerbate the divide between wealthy and poor students. Encouraging these students to develop their passions and receive a well-rounded education is a first and essential step in bridging the socio-economic gap between students. 
The detriments of defunding the NEA and NEH supremely outweigh any potential benefit of saving 0.006 percent of the federal budget. Before these invaluable resources are callously cut, the administration must seriously consider the effects that this will have on education systems. 
This is not a political issue, but rather, one of the enrichment of intellectual diversity and affording the arts and humanities the respect and funding these fields deserve. Defunding the NEH and NEA grants would reach beyond politics to deny educational balance, diversity and a wide range of opportunities from the students and young people who need these most.

Colleges across the country, including Northwestern University and the University of Iowa, have responded to President Donald Trump’s racially divisive rhetoric and policy. These institutions have rolled out new initiatives, committees and research grants with the sole purpose of promoting diversity and inclusiveness. Beyond the importance of solidarity and advocating for groups that have been unfairly attacked by the policies and rhetoric of this new administration, such efforts amount to deeply important educational and real-world benefits as well. USC must ensure that despite today’s divisive political climate, students of all backgrounds and identities feel secure enough to equally contribute to their learning environments. 
People of marginalized identities face more and more hostility and pushback under this presidential administration, which has already made clear its intent to crack down on deportations and bar the entrance of Muslims fleeing persecution. Thus, the myriad of benefits to diversity, in all spheres of society but in education most of all, must be emphasized now more than ever. The University must make protecting diversity, a critical staple of any successful environment of higher learning, a priority.
USC recently hired Shaun R. Harper, an expert at promoting diversity, to join its faculty as a professor as well as the founder of the USC Race and Equity Center. The University is on its way to improving the experiences of students of color as well as other marginalized minority groups, but given today’s divisive political climate — which has left many members of the student body feeling vulnerable and unsafe — more steps must still be taken to bridge the gap between these resources and the students who need them. 
 More than 24 percent of USC’s student body is composed of international students, and 42 percent of its student body comes from ethnic minority groups. USC prides itself on its ethnic and cultural diversity. 
According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, USC ranks second out of the top 25 national universities in terms of diversity, analyzing data from both students and faculty. As a large, selective university with one of the most racially diverse student bodies in the country, USC has a clear responsibility to cultivate an atmosphere on campus that encourages cross-cultural interactions, which would be to the benefit of all members of the student body. Study after study has corroborated that diversity is a cornerstone of higher learning and preparing oneself for the professional world.
According to data from the 2015 United States Census, Asian Americans and non-Hispanic white Americans are more likely to hold bachelor’s degrees or higher than African Americans and Hispanics. The widespread circulation of data such as this contributes to the formation of negative stereotypes toward minority groups. In establishing campus climates that support all students of color in their educational pursuits, USC would effectively contribute to dismantling these harmful societal stereotypes. After all, diversity does not stop at mere numbers.
By promoting a mindset that looks beyond racial misconceptions, USC would be able to help bridge these gaps and limit the extent to which racial background contributes to educational achievement. Hosting diversity and inclusion rallies and establishing an office to ensure marginalized identities are protected by allowing students to report their experiences and seek counseling are crucial steps to making sure students of all backgrounds are able to contribute to USC’s academic environment to the benefit of all students. Developing atmospheres of inclusion has been shown to stimulate innovation across all fields, as students become more aware of different cultures beyond their common stereotypes. 
Demographics released by the U.S. Census state that by 2050, there will be no clear racial minority. Keeping these statistics in mind, failing to develop a campus climate that embraces diversity could be considered a failure to prepare the future workforce of the United States. 
Exactly who is or what group is threatened, persecuted or excluded at USC?  It all sounds like a false narrative, but ever so hip.
College is such a coddled, insulated environment. No amount of JEP or “cultural immersion” is going to change that.
