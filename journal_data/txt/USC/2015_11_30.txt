Nestled in the Temporary Research Facility in the northwest corner of campus, the Kay Lab with its greenhouses and pipetting stations is a world apart from the stately interior of Bovard Auditorium. But Steve Kay, outgoing dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, has comfortably moved between the two for the last three years, swapping his jacket for a lab coat.
On Monday, Kay left USC to assume his new role as president of The Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. Dornsife executive vice dean Dani Byrd will become interim dean on Tuesday.
“Leading with enthusiasm and dedication, Dean Kay ensured the continued excellence of our institution’s oldest and most diverse academic unit over his three-year tenure,” Provost Michael Quick said in a statement on Sept. 18 when the announcement was made. “He leaves USC in a stronger position to solve some of society’s most challenging problems that ultimately serve the global public good.”
Kay’s journey to USC took him across the Atlantic from his childhood home in the Isle of Jersey, off the coast of Normandy, France. His father, a retired electrical contractor, and his mother, who worked in a knitwear factory, never finished high school. His grandfather was a commercial lobster fisherman. Kay said his teachers nurtured his interest in science.
“Certainly there was a connection to biology through where I grew up, a small island in a massive tidal zone, but really it was teachers, and it was teachers who had a passion for their students,” Kay said.
Kay is a prolific researcher and a pioneer in the field of circadian rhythms, biological processes in plants and animals that follow a day-night cycle. In addition to his responsibilities as dean, he heads the Kay Lab, which focuses on understanding circadian rhythms at the molecular level.
“He’s really supportive, he’s really pushing us to think in an innovative way, pushing the limits, and I think that’s inspiring,” said Sabrina Sanchez, a post-doctoral fellow who joined the Kay Lab in 2013.
Kay said that his role at TSRI will give him the opportunity to pursue translational research and drug discovery, both of which he has a keen interest in. Personal factors also played a role in the decision — he has young children who live in San Diego — but Kay said the decision was an agonizing one, taken in consultation with mentors removed from both Scripps and USC.
“What’s attracted me about returning to Scripps is there’s a real opportunity to participate in changing something that I’ve had a lifelong passion about, and that is right in my sweet spot as a scientist,” he said.
Kay said he will be working to address the unmet needs created by the market-driven pharmaceutical industry, helping to develop new, cost-effective treatments for patients in the nonprofit sector. One of his biggest challenges will be to make the institute more independent of funding from the National Institutes of Health, the primary source of federal research dollars, which he said “waxes and wanes” depending on the state of the economy.
“These things just don’t come along very often, and if you let them go, I was concerned that I’d have spent quite a bit of the rest of my life wondering, what if?” Kay said.
Kay began his tenure as dean of Dornsife in 2012 after serving as the dean of the division of biological sciences and the Richard C. Atkinson Chair in biological sciences at the University of California, San Diego. Kay said he was attracted by the “fierceness of the leadership” at USC, including then-Executive Vice Provost Quick, then-Provost Elizabeth Garrett and President C. L. Max Nikias.
“I wanted to come to a university that I saw was really on the move,” he said.
Kay said that balancing his responsibilities as dean with his role as a researcher was challenging, but also gave him unique perspective.
“Being an active researcher gives you credibility with the faculty,” he said. “I was up  ’til two in the morning last night finishing an NIH grant application, just like any of the other faculty members were.”
Kay spoke about some of the initiatives he was most proud of during his time at USC, including the expansion of the quantitative social sciences centered in Dauterive Hall. He mentioned the creation of new majors for Dornsife students including international relations (global business) and geodesign, as well as new chemistry teaching labs for undergraduates.
Kay also noted his efforts to assist students in pre-med and pre-health tracks including preparation for the new MCAT and other programs for students interested in the health sciences. He pushed for the creation of scholarships to help students participate in co-curricular activities such as Problems Without Passports and summer research.
“Overall, I’m really proud of how, in general, we’ve massively raised the profile of USC Dornsife,” Kay said. “We’re more visible, I think, than when I came here.”
Kay described his guiding philosophy as dean of the University’s largest academic division.
“It has to be an unwavering commitment to academic rigor and quality in the faculty because that is the core body by which we are able to deliver our mission,” he said.
That mission, Kay said, involves the creation and transmission of knowledge through research and teaching, as well as the translation of knowledge for public benefit.
“That could be a drug that comes out of a lab, it could be a policy that comes out of a paper, it could be an understanding of social injustice and its role in the economy,” he said.
Kay emphasized that becoming dean was not merely the next rung on the academic ladder, but a commitment to serve.
“You have to have that humility and as I close that door late at night each day when I leave here, I try to remember that, who am I going to serve tomorrow,” he said.
Kay said that the most exciting yet difficult part of his job was the “massive depth and breadth” of Dornsife.
“It’s this exhilaration to be talking with somebody who is bridging philosophy and physics, you know, really looking at the edges of our understanding of the universe and what it actually means to ponder to be human or to ponder religious experience when you’re thinking about the weird physics that happens at the very edge of the universe,” he said.
That interdisciplinary nature of Dornsife, Kay said, also makes it difficult for the college to have a clear identity.
“Dornsife’s challenge is we’re a hairball. In the modern world of networks and connectivity, we’re this massive hairball — we’re both nowhere on campus and we’re all over the campus,” he said.
Kay said a big challenge for his successor will be making sure that the research efforts of the University are coupled with the course curriculum. He said another challenge for the next dean will be to continue to articulate the value of foundational degrees in the liberal arts during a time when that value is constantly questioned.
“Our students are pounded with, quite frankly, misinformation about what a liberal arts degree gets you, and I think we have to constantly be data-driven and calm and informed about helping our students understand that a degree in narrative writing, a degree in art history, a degree in psychology, all of these amazing educational experiences that we have at Dornsife provide you a platform to be adaptable and critical and synthetic,” he said.
Kay’s parting advice to students was to engage with faculty and seek out opportunities both within Dornsife and USC. Though he is staying on as an adjunct faculty member and adviser to the provost, he said he will miss the school spirit of USC and is leaving laden with items from the bookstore.
“Before I came here I might have made the mistake of thinking that the Trojan Family had to include a helmet and pads, and I love the team, but I’ve really learned that the Trojan Family is much, much more than that,” he said.
After a series of misadventures between  USC and Scripps, does Kay’s transition bode well for a more collaborative relationship? Why hasn’t anybody even pondered this question?

The USC chapter of Swipe Out Hunger, a student organization that collects unused dining dollars to donate to charity, is hosting its Fall 2015 “Swipes Week” from Monday through Friday.
Swipes Week occurs during the last week of classes each semester to encourage students to contribute their leftover dining dollars to Swipe Out Hunger, which in turn donates food to Jovenes, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping homeless youths become integrated members of their communities.
“We think of [Swipe Out Hunger] as a win-win-win,” said Katelyn Kulaga, the organization’s president. “USC gets to donate food, we get to feed the homeless and students are empowered to make a difference simply by giving their dining dollars.”
During Swipes Week, volunteers set up tables in front of EVK and Parkside from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to spread awareness for the campaign and sign up participants to donate. Swipe Out Hunger also uses Tapingo and Google Forms to register interested students.
Jovenes, the nonprofit organization that receives USC Swipe Out Hunger’s proceeds, provides housing and community-based services to homeless and at-risk 18-25 year-olds. Their mission is to give them opportunities to become productive citizens and make better lives for themselves. Through dining dollar donations, Swipe Out Hunger has served thousands of meals to these underprivileged youths throughout Los Angeles.
Swipe Out Hunger was founded in 2009 at UCLA and has grown rapidly since, with 14 chapters nationwide. USC’s chapter of Swipe Out Hunger, active since 2012, partners with USC Hospitality to convert dining dollars into pounds of food that is donated on behalf of the organization. Volunteers help to distribute the food on “Giving Day,” which takes place during the first week of the following semester.
Madelina Pratt, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, said she donates because of the tangible impact it has on those in need.
“So many people don’t ever use their swipes towards the end of the year,” Pratt said. “After volunteering on Skid Row, I saw firsthand that many people don’t have any food at all, yet we have more food than we could ever eat.”
Swipe Out Hunger is also currently hosting a food drive to donate canned goods to the Los Angeles Food Bank. Cans are being accepted at Ground Zero and Smiles’ Cafe until Friday.
The organization is also seeking to expand the volunteer opportunities available to students to provide Trojans with more ways to fight homelessness in Los Angeles.
“We want to make volunteer outreach a bigger part of Swipe Out Hunger,” said Daniel Knupp, vice president of events coordination.
Knupp’s goal is to create events every semester for students to work at food banks and give back in a direct way, and Kulaga emphasized student involvement.
“What’s most important is to get more people involved in helping out a great cause,” she said. “Swipe Out Hunger is an easy way to make a difference.”

Part-time School of Social Work students are currently petitioning the administration in reaction to new curriculum implemented this year. Amanda Armoogam, the Master of Social Work student heading the petition, met with administrative leaders last weekend to discuss the effects of the new curriculum on part-time students.
Armoogam’s concerns involve students who were displaced from their original campuses and who will now struggle to finish their coursework in time for certification. But she is also concerned with the fact that the administration made these changes without consulting students, and without informing them in advance. The School of Social Work held several town hall meetings last year to inform students that the curriculum would be changing, but the specific changes were never announced.
It wasn’t until August that Armoogam found out the specific changes. Many of her classmates remained unaware for months into the semester, only discovering the issues when they went to enroll for spring classes. After reaching out to her own classmates, Armoogam created a Facebook page to bring together students who are affected. Since then, she’s been contacted by students from every campus who are concerned about the effects of the new curriculum.
“I was kind of shocked,” Armoogam said. “I knew it was 300 students being affected, but I didn’t realize that at every campus there were students being affected by it.”
The new curriculum creates several problems for current students. A major program was cut in San Diego, meaning that some students must commute from their homes in San Diego to the Orange County campus, or take their classes online. Additionally, two classes that used to be part of the core MSW curriculum have been merged. For students who already took them, the classes are now counted as two of the three electives that each student is allowed to take.
These changes mean that some students are commuting for around four hours a day, a cost in both time and money that was unexpected up until this year. They also mean that some students will have to take extra classes after graduation, since the electives they previously planned to take are unavailable to them with only one elective slot left. For these reasons, Armoogam has created a petition and begun talking to administrators over the last few months in order to make the voices of the MSW students heard.
The petition includes four main requests from the administration. One is for travel stipends and free parking spaces to be granted to displaced students who must travel to a different campus for their studies. This request was agreed upon during the meeting on Saturday. However, Armoogam believes there are still important measures to take to ensure fair treatment for MSW students.
“The big question here is, as a private college, do they have to answer to the students?” Armoogam said. “Are administrators really allowed to make major changes without even informing the students, not to mention asking their opinions?”
Armoogam said she hopes to secure a scholarship for students whose elective options were diminished or altered by the change. The new curriculum cut $3 million in electives funding, and many of the elective options were altered. This means that students don’t have the same access to the electives necessary for graduation. The petition asks for scholarships to offset the added classes that students might have to take due to this change.
The petition also requests that students on the Orange County campus are allowed a semester of weekend courses. These courses give more flexibility to students who are part-time and work jobs during the week. The request includes lowering the minimum student enrollment to 10 students, in order to make the class more available.
The final request involves the Pupil Personnel Services Credential, a type of authorization that allows students to specialize in school counseling, school social work, school psychology and child welfare in schools. Armoogam wants a Virtual Academic Center option for the students working toward this program. This virtual option would also make it easier for students who are part-time and can’t add a third class.
Each of these requests would help students in a different way, but Armoogam believes that each is an important part of supporting MSW students in light of the new curriculum. With the first request already met, Armagoom hopes this will be an ongoing discussion that will result in a curriculum that more closely mirrors the old one. Her main concern, however, is making sure that all students can take the classes they need the most and still graduate on time.
“My hope is that they recognize that students are participants in the program,” Armoogam said. “For us to not have a say in our organization and how it’s run is a shame.”
Corrections: This article previously mispelled Amanda Armoogam’s name as Armagoom. It also stated Provost Michael Quick was present at the meeting. He was not. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Senior night · Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio celebrates her team’s 30th win of the season with her coach on senior night. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
It was an eventful Thanksgiving weekend for the USC women’s volleyball team, which not only captured a Pac-12 Conference championship on Senior Day, but also received the No. 1 overall seed in the upcoming 2015 NCAA Division I Women’s Volleyball Championship. The Women of Troy (30-2) won their eighth overall conference title on Friday and will carry that momentum into this week when they host Cleveland State on Thursday in the first round of the tournament at the Galen Center.
Senior Day for the Trojans turned into a championship celebration on Friday after they notched their 30th victory of the season with a 25-11, 25-21, 25-19 sweep over Cal. The win secured USC’s share of the Pac-12 Championship after they ended with an 18-2 record in conference play. The Women of Troy finish tied for first in the Pac-12 with Washington after being picked to finish fifth by league coaches in a preseason poll.
In addition, USC’s three seniors, Samantha Bricio, Alicia Ogoms and Eve Ettinger, were all honored in pre-match ceremonies against the Bears. Though Bricio and Ogoms have been mainstays in the USC lineup since they came to Troy in 2012, Ettinger was a member of last year’s AVCA Sand National Championship team and was part of the 2011 indoor team that won the program’s last        Pac-12 title.
Ogoms, one of the nation’s leading blockers, once again showed her dominance at the net against Cal by recording a    match-high five blocks to go along with seven kills on a .600 hitting percentage. Offensively, Bricio led all players with 16 kills on just 32 swings, while adding two aces and two blocks to finish with 19.0 points on the day.
“It was amazing to win the conference with my team, and with our families being here, I thought it was even more special,” Bricio said. “Finishing the regular season like this is just amazing.”
Furthermore, Bricio joined elite company when she became the first Trojan and just the seventh player in conference history to cross the 2,000th kill plateau. Her last kill of the match gave her 2,005 in her career and moved her ahead of Hana Cutura (Cal,     2006-09) for sixth place all-time in Pac-12 history.
Head coach Mick Haley was pleased that his team was able to end the season on a high note before heading into the tournament.
“We’ve been playing against ourselves for a couple of weeks and now I think we’ve just about played ourselves through that … We’re ready to get into the tournament and go after folks,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy did not have to wait long on Selection Sunday to hear their fate. USC earned the top seed in the 64-team field and will host the first and second rounds of the tournament at the Galen Center as part of the San Diego regional. The Trojans will face Horizon League champion Cleveland State (26-6) in their opener, marking just the second meeting all-time between the two programs. Should USC defeat the Vikings, they will play the winner of the Northern Arizona/San Diego match in the second round on Friday. Tipoff against Cleveland State begins this Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the Galen Center.

When I woke up this morning to the news that head coach Clay Helton is here to stay, I was ecstatic. As the day went on though, I began to read more criticism of the Helton hire and grow wary of Haden’s decision. Why not just wait until the end of the season and conduct a national search? Even if Helton ultimately wins the job, what’s the rush?
Furthermore, if Haden is on his way out, why is he the one to make the hire in the first place? The entire idea behind Haden stepping down at the end of the season is that he’s not fit to hire the next head coach.
But ultimately, my faith in Haden and Helton was restored when I saw a video posted by the Athletic Department of the team reacting to Helton’s hire and cheering his name and crowding around him in celebration. And that is why I have been in support of Helton all season.
He has turned the team into a band of brothers. I don’t know what goes on in the locker room or in team meetings, but Helton has rallied the team after so much adversity this season and given them something to play for.
He brought back family dinners on Monday nights and Monday practices for redshirts and players not getting a lot of reps.
Perhaps it’s his consistency. Helton is in his sixth season with the Trojans, having been a consistent presence through Kiffin, Orgeron and Sarkisian.
Helton’s hire has left many Trojan fans scratching their heads as to why Haden felt that Helton was a good hire while Orgeron was not. But I actually agree with Haden on this one as well. Orgeron, like Helton, certainly had heart and knew how to motivate his team. That was realistically the extent of Orgeron’s reach. Helton, on the other hand, has proven he has a style of his own — a slowed-down tempo reliant on the run game. He also beat UCLA, something Sarkisian and Orgeron never did at USC.
I had the opportunity recently to sit down with next year’s starting quarterback Max Browne, who couldn’t speak highly enough of Helton and said that he and the team were fully behind the coach. Sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and many other players echoed Browne’s sentiments, with many players even taking to Twitter to publicly show their support.
That’s not to say that players always know best in terms of who should lead the team, but when players not only voice their support, but also show it in their success on the field, it seems hard to ignore.
Lastly, I think making the move before the Pac-12 Championship game gives the team something extra to play for. They’ll face a Stanford team that is even better than when they met in Week 3, so Helton will need to rally his team in a way that only he knows how.

Holiday hoops · Junior forward Nikola Jovanovic and the Trojans began the season 5-0, including an upset over No. 20 Wichita State, before falling to No. 23 Xavier and Monmouth, which has upsets over UCLA and No. 17 Notre Dame. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The men’s basketball team had a strong showing at the AdvoCare Invitational in Orlando over Thanksgiving weekend, upsetting No. 20 Wichita State in the first round before falling to No. 23 Xavier in the semifinals and Monmouth in the third place game.
Thursday’s 72-69 win over Wichita State marked the first time the Trojans had beaten a team ranked in the top 25 since 2013.
Freshman forward Bennie Boatwright led the way with a career-high 22 points. The Men of Troy took a narrow one-point lead into halftime, but Wichita State went on a 12-0 run in the second half to take a 49-43 advantage. The Trojans responded, though, and consecutive threes by Boatwright and Elijah Stewart put them ahead 61-54 with just under seven minutes to play.
Boatwright made more big plays down the stretch, hitting another three to extend a             two-point USC lead. Then, he came up with a steal that led to a Katin Reinhardt three-pointer, giving the Trojans a 70-62 lead with 1:19 remaining.
USC hung on for the upset after a desperation game-tying three by Wichita State went off the rim.
However, the Trojans were unable to replicate the upset against No. 23 Xavier in the semifinals in an 87-77 loss. It would have been the first time they notched wins against multiple ranked opponents in the same season since 2010-2011.
Xavier came out on fire, jumping out to a 19-3 lead just five minutes into the game. The Musketeers doubled up on the Trojans in the first half, taking a 54-27 advantage at halftime. They shot 57.6 percent in the half, while the Trojans committed 15 fouls and turned the ball over 12 times.
USC, led by 15 points each from Nikola Jovanovic and Julian Jacobs, was more competitive in the second half, but it was not enough to erase the large first half deficit.
To conclude the tournament, the Trojans fell victim to a pesky Monmouth team in a 83-73 loss. Monmouth had already upset UCLA and No. 17 Notre Dame in the early going, and had played tough against the Trojans in a 101-90 USC win at the Galen Center earlier in November.
The Trojans could not contain Monmouth guard Justin Robinson, who had a game-high 27 points. Robinson went on a 10-2 run by himself late in the first half to help his team go up by nine at halftime.
The Hawks opened up a double-digit lead for much of the second half. Despite a late push by the Trojans to claw within three at 73-70, Monmouth ended the game on a 10-3 run to pull away for the win.
USC leaves Orlando with a 5-2 record, which ranks seventh in the Pac-12. The Trojans have a road game on Thursday in Santa Barbara against the Gauchos.

The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens returned with its annual L.A. Zoo Lights event beginning Nov. 27, complete with thousands of lights and animated installations to add holiday spirit to Griffith Park. The spectacular displays and enchanting and spirited environment made for a delightful night for family and friends. Some attractions included real life reindeers, a musical light-and-water show, glittering light tunnels and dozens of illuminated snowflakes.
The winter wonderland will be held through the beginning of 2016. With its debut just last year, the event garnered more than 170,000 visitors and an accolade on USA Today for 10 Best Readers’ Choice travel awards. Whether it’s sipping some steamy hot chocolate, munching on delicious churros or walking hand in hand with loved ones to enjoy the breathtaking lights, the L.A. Zoo is the perfect holiday destination for the most wonderful time of the year.
Though previous years have been very successful, the Los Angeles Zoo continues to raise the bar. In addition to more lights, displays, decorations and effects, the zoo expanded the LAIR. The LAIR, which stands for Living Amphibians, Invertebrates and Reptiles, contains a gigantic light up snake from the rooftop to greet guests who enter the building. The LAIR creatively ties the zoo and Christmas lights together to create glowing webs, orbs and insects in ultraviolet light. Reindeer Romp Village, a small ornamented and reimagined area is the perfect place for parents to bring their children. The area is a bustling place with snowflakes, white Christmas trees and a real life Santa to take special holiday photos. The atmosphere is completed by upbeat pop music and Christmas songs to get visitors smiling and dancing. Another addition to the excitement is “Lightscapes: Wild Holiday,” an aquatic show that contains animations, music and lighted fountains and shooting water.
Other new features include VIP events such as the Holiday Happy Hour for guests over 21 and a Family New Year’s Eve for all ages on Dec. 10. The happy hour featured a lounge serving appetizers, wine and hot and cold specialty cocktails. The family event provides an opportunity “to celebrate 2016 in style with skip the line express entry, dinner buffet, soft drinks, complimentary champagne for adults, sparkling apple cider for kids, dessert, a ride on the Zoo’s carousel, DJ dance party, cash bar and live music,” according to the zoo’s website.
L.A. Zoo Lights is open every night from 6 to 10 p.m., except for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Tickets are $13 for adults and seniors and $11 for children ages two to 12 on Mondays through Thursdays, except from Dec. 21 to 23 when tickets are the same as weekend prices. The weekend prices are $16 for adults and seniors and $14 for children ages two to 12. There are also special ticket prices available after 9 p.m. Additional ticket information and to purchase tickets can be found online.

The troisième “trois” has finally come about, in the form of Chef Ludo Lefebvre’s new breakfast and brunch spot, Trois Familia, which follows in the footsteps of his other Los Angeles restaurants Trois Mec and Petit Trois.
The French chef is serving up French-Mexican fusion at his new spot in Silver Lake from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day. The restaurant exclusively serves breakfast, brunch and dessert. As the name implies, Trois Familia is a more casual, less costly introduction to Lefebvre’s fare.
Arriving at Trois Familia is a lot like arriving at your favorite local Thai spot. It’s in a strip mall, unassuming, with somewhat garish signage — in this case, rainbow-hued bubble letters spell out the name — but you know something special awaits inside.
The bright coloring doesn’t stop on the outside. The restaurant’s small room is painted in bright red, blue and green hues and decorated with kitschy accessories. White picnic benches serve as communal tables, contributing to the overall relaxed feel of the restaurant.
On a recent Saturday morning, the wait list contained over a page of unseated parties. However, on a Friday afternoon around 1 p.m., the restaurant was just over half full, with groups ranging from families to a group of young guys to couples enjoying the accessible fare of the restaurant.
In some ways, however, the laid-back vibe is a construction that hides the chef’s conceits. Waiters recommend parties share a few dishes between them, but refuse to hand out extra plates, even upon request. That means two people are often awkwardly left looking at one dish placed between them — as dishes are also brought out as soon as they are ready, rather than all together — wondering how to eat it. The restaurant is laid back like a hipster’s $90 “relaxed” t-shirt.
The strictness on concerns such as this is made up for by an extremely friendly staff full of recommendations, readily offering suggestions including the French toast, hash brown chilaquiles and potato tacos — most of the dishes lean more toward the Mexican side of French-Mexican fusion, at least at first glance.
The churro French toast truly lives up to the name. Each bite tasted like its fried cinnamon inspiration, but with the added depth of a soft, eggy center. Topped with Portland-based Salt & Straw ice cream, however, the dish is more dessert than a brunch item, especially when paired with the often spicy, savory dishes that compose most of the rest of the menu.
One such item was the highly recommended crispy hash brown chilaquiles. The brunch-oriented hash browns replace tortilla chips as the star of the dish, but serve the same purpose — a vehicle for salsa and hot sauce that just toes the line of too spicy. The hash browns’ crunchy outer shell masks the soft strips of potato within, which quickly soak up the sauce. Fresh cilantro garnish cuts the fiery taste with a fresh burst of flavor, while a perfectly poached egg further soaks up the sauce and adds a pretty finish to the dish.
Though vegetarian, the double decker potato tacos are surprisingly substantial, filled to the brim with cheese and potatoes and brightly topped with carrots. The “double decker” title refers to a smaller hard shell within a soft flour shell of the tacos, exempting patrons from having to answer the age-old soft/hard taco shell dilemma.
The dishes tend to range from $10-$15, though some meat options come in higher, and a cup of hot coffee is a whopping $5. Dishes tend to be small and the waitress’s recommendation — that two people share three plates — was spot on.
Trois Familia is open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at 3510 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90026.

Superhero noir · Actress Krysten Ritter plays Jessica Jones, the protagonist of the eponymous television series on Netflix. Jones, equipped with superpowers, runs her own private investigation firm after her stint as a hero failed. The villain Kilgrave (David Tennant), however, pulls her back. – Photo courtesy of Netflix
This past week, Netflix released Marvel’s Jessica Jones as the latest in its slew of original series that’s put the streaming service on the map in terms of quality programming. Starring Krysten Ritter as the title character, the show follows private detective Jones as she attempts to track down and destroy a mind-controlling man named Kilgrave. The series opens with Kilgrave forcing a young girl to kill her parents, leading Jones on a twisted, complicated goose chase around New York City as she hopes to implicate — not kill — Kilgrave in order to absolve the girl of her crime. Jones is helped by her local celebrity best friend Trish and the perpetually high next door neighbor Malcolm, in addition to engaging in a love-hate relationship with a lawyer named Jeri Hogarth. A brother and sister duo also live downstairs in a Tennessee Williams-esque family drama which further complicate the tangled web of psychological manipulation and torment. On top of everything else, Jones has superhuman strength and very good jumping skills to boot.
I had hoped by the publication of this column — the last of the year — I would’ve been able to finish the season and write a well-informed opinion on the series as whole, but as of these words, I have yet to do so. That being said, of the 11 episodes I have seen in their entirety, it’s clear Netflix has another winner on its hands — not just in terms of good drama but also in terms of provoking, progressive content that other shows should look to in the future. Jones — despite the fact that she wears no costume and doesn’t have a superhero name — is a superhero of female empowerment in a stubbornly male game.
On the periphery of the main story, men catcall and taunt Jones as she walks through Manhattan’s streets, to which she snaps back but moves on, unperturbed. She isn’t a victim, even as she’s punched and cut and tormented and thrown around episode after episode by various bad guys and assailants. She’s strong — both emotionally and physically — but not overtly. She has problems too; she drinks incessantly and also has deep-rooted trust issues.
At first, I felt her alcoholism seemed like an easy choice in terms of character development or keeping her from seeming too perfect or Wonder Woman-y. I felt the creators had to show some foible of the female protagonist to make her seem more “real” or more female, but I admit, this was my predisposed mind expecting the worst out of the creators. It’s almost laughable that I found this to be a fault of the show because eventually I realized that Jones’s flaws were exactly the type of characteristic I had wanted so desperately and wrote about last year in a column exploring why the industry hasn’t given us a female Sherlock Holmes. With Jones, we’re one step closer to treating female protagonists the same as men in terms of what they can do and what actions are deemed “acceptable” — both good and bad.
That isn’t to say that the show is without its faults. The pilot episode includes copious amounts of shots through things; canted angles through grates, windows and doorways. It seems to imply the act of looking at Jessica, just as she’s looking at her client’s targets. But even then, the choices seem childish and misinformed. Thankfully, the directors — of which three out of nine are female — cease these foolish stylizations and let the drama unfold as naturally and smoothly as possible considering the plot is outlandish and unbelievable. There are a lot of melodramatic moments and corny, contrived scenes of dialogue, but at its heart, Jessica Jones and the character’s crime-stopping capabilities is important to promoting female-led television and media.
That isn’t to say that every episode in itself is a man-fighting microcosm of feminist action and justice. On the contrary, the very premise of the show is built upon one woman’s propensity to be seduced and follow another man to the depths of crime and evil. Jessica is continually beaten and duped by Kilgrave, and nothing about her powers come from the fact that she is a woman. But that’s where the beauty of the show lies. It doesn’t feel injected with an equality agenda. We are not hit over the head by the diverse casting or characters. They simply live in this world, as they should.
The best example of this lies in the depiction of Hogarth — played by The Matrix’s Carrie-Anne Moss — who is an extremely powerful and successful defense attorney and one of Jones’s chief clients. Jeri also happens to be a lesbian embroiled in a difficult divorce with her wife of 20 years. Additionally, Jeri is sleeping with her secretary — an inversion of the male Mad Men trope that should not be lost on the audience, though I only consciously realized this role reversal when explaining the series to a friend. All these details are barely acknowledged within the show. Gay slurs or references to the women’s sexual preference are not exploited or used as devices to further the plot. Had the characters been switched and a man taken Moss’s role, nothing about the actual story would change. This, in itself, is the best thing about the whole series.
Jessica Jones inhabits a world that Hollywood should take note of — one where diversity need not be addressed as exceptional or out of the ordinary, but rather just reality. Plain and simple.

With record numbers of applications rolling in, admission to top-choice institutions has become more elusive than ever before. In this atmosphere, it is unsurprising that some would turn to the influx of international students — a mere 5 percent of all undergraduates in American colleges — to explain the vicious competition of higher education. A recent article in The Atlantic argues that international students should never take a place in an entering freshman class that could have gone to a U.S. citizen, even at private universities — and states that many international students may be lying on their applications in order to achieve admission. Claiming that international recruiters are paid to favor some students over others, especially in highly competitive countries such as China and India, denounces the presence of the international student as another rusted gear in the inner workings of American higher education.
The stakes are high in the search for an acceptance letter. With the undergraduate diploma quickly becoming the millennial’s equivalent of a baby boomer’s high school education, more people than ever before are applying to universities — and spending more time preparing their applications. Companies like the Princeton Review and Kaplan, Inc. charge hundreds or thousands of dollars for test-prep courses and application counseling, creating an entire college admissions industry. Meanwhile, admissions rates are dropping precipitously. Tuition rates have climbed at an alarming rate, even within the past 10 years. Parents across the nation find themselves gripped by the fear that their children may be outcompeted. Truth be told, many are. Not everybody attends Harvard or Stanford, University of California Berkeley or USC. But it’s not because of the presence of international students. They are not the problem — we are.
Admissions percentages have decreased, but the number of international students has not increased proportionally at these schools. These decreases are not due to the displacement of U.S. citizens by international students, but rather because the sheer number of applications has dramatically increased. American students are not being outcompeted — they are simply competing with each other at a higher rate. The decline of funding for public universities by state governments has resulted in not only more prospective students, but also fewer available seats. Despite these financial impediments, public systems like the University of California have consistently expanded the number of students they are willing to take on, the vast majority of whom are not only natural-born U.S. citizens, but in-state students. This past year, UC Berkeley admitted a grand total of 13,324 applicants, of which only 8.8 percent were from outside the U.S. Moreover, this 8.8 percent of foreign students were overqualified for admittance — the mean SAT, GPA and ACT scores of international admits were consistently higher than those of in-state and out-of-state students, according to UC Berkeley’s freshman profile. Taxpayer-funded, public universities are arguably the institutions with the most obligation to favor domestic students — and despite opponents’ denunciations of international enrollment, it appears that these universities are undeniably maintaining their commitment to the public.
However, private universities host much larger numbers of international students. USC is among the leading educators of foreign undergraduates, with 14 percent of admitted students hailing from secondary schools outside of the United States during the fall 2015 enrollment cycle, according to USC’s freshman profile. With private schools like USC taking larger amounts of international students who could potentially displace domestic ones, the question remains as to whether there is anything to be gained by these policies.
The primary purpose of a university is to provide students with a holistic education. This cannot be done while maintaining a U.S.-centric mindset inconducive to the characteristics of a global society. A very small percentage of American students either have the funding or the opportunity to study abroad, and thus, interactions with international students may be one of the first and most important college experiences with those with different customs and value systems. The ability to share experiences with young people of other nations and cultures is an experience necessary to becoming a global citizen, and one that universities are aware of when they add international students to their freshman profile.
In truth, the admission system keeps a host of administrative issues that require complex solutions — but the admission of international students is not a contributing cause. Rapidly decreasing admissions rates are due to a multitude of socioeconomic factors, but past the admissions hurdle, American students can only hope to become and remain competitive if they can interact in a globalized society. International students should not become our new scapegoat. The system is broken — but barring international students is a pointless and dangerous band-aid method.
Putting aside head counts, simply being an
international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language.
Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking
on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to
help anyone coming to the US is “What
Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy
American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is
used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by
ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became
successful in the US and how they contributed to our society, including
students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be
accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture,
friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after
graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to
get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to
work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and
speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the
number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international
departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and informative books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so
we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!
Good article. Agreed.

USC Student Body President Rini Sampath and I made a bet. The wager was that the president of the school that lost in Saturday’s game had to write something nice in the opposing school’s newspaper. Daily Trojan, here I am sticking to my word. While I am sad that the Bruins lost, I am honored to have the opportunity to write this piece.
UCLA vs. USC is a longstanding crosstown rivalry. It is one that extends from the classroom to the field and leaves no Bruin or Trojan without feelings of immense competition and opposition toward the other. It is a tradition for every Bruin or Trojan to compare anything measurable from academic ranking to NCAA Championships to food in the dining halls. Growing up with a father who is a proud Trojan alumnus, I know what a “house divided” truly means.
While demonstrating unwavering support for our respective schools, there are times when we need to set aside our differences and recognize things greater than our rivalry. This past Saturday, I had one of those moments and was very moved by the University of Southern California. It was not because the team played a great game or because the band entertained the crowd with a fantastic halftime show. It was because of one specific member of the Trojan family: USC long-snapper Jake Olson. According to ESPN, Olson was born with a rare cancer in his retina called retinoblastoma and was left completely blind by age 12. He had been a fan of the Trojans for years, and it was Coach Pete Carroll who introduced Olson to the team when he was a child, making him part of the Trojan family. His connection to USC did not end there. Olson realized his dream of being a Trojan football player and became their long snapper, wearing the cardinal and gold with pride. By working with NCAA and scholarship regulations, the Trojans made it a top priority to provide the opportunity that Olson deserved. To the Orange County Register, he said, “It felt right. Being there before, in a travel suit or not in uniform, something inside of me was saying, `Get in a uniform. That’s where you belong.’”
It is Olson’s optimism and positive attitude that motivates those around him. Quarterback Cody Kessler explained to the Los Angeles Times, “He never makes excuses, he never complains about anything. He’s out here working his butt off.” In the same piece, Carroll stated, “He is one of the greatest competitors I’ve known. He epitomizes the spirit of ‘Fight On!’”
Though I have not personally met Olson, I felt his presence Saturday throughout the stands. During a timeout in the game, the Trojans honored Olson by bringing him onto the field and telling his story on the jumbotron. Bruins and Trojans alike became one as they heard about Olson’s inspiring journey. Every person in that stadium became a member of Team Olson, united by his commitment and tenacity to never abandon his dream.
Trojans, I must admit I am impressed. It is your students and your athletes that have shown me the strength of solidarity and support of your fellow Trojan, Jake Olson. And Jake, you have shown me what positivity and perseverance truly mean. Each of us may say “Fight On” or “Go Bruins,” but all of us say “Go Jake.”
Heather Rosen
UCLA Student Body President
Correction: This article previously stated Olson had rhinoblastoma. He has retinoblastoma. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Are you Josh’s sister?
Beautiful piece. Class act. 
I have an oustanding $20 eachbet with two Bruins alumni. I’m still waiting for them to pay up. One guy told my wife he doesn’t remembermak I ng the bet. Figures. Another bRuin loser and he’s a very wealthy man, just not in character.
Assuming that Jake is considered “for real” by the Trojans, and our opponents, I’m looking forward to him playing football as much as he is.  Well, maybe not quite that much.  Is there any plan for this to happen?
Great write up Heather. For the sake of accuracy, Jake had retinoblastoma (not rhinoblastoma). GO BRUINS!
Heather, you are a credit to UCLA and if I were a student there, I would be proud to claim you as a fellow Bruin. Student Body President? You are a fine leader who sets a great example of sportsmanship. Best of luck to you.

Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
No one likes to miss out. This is especially true for millennials tied to their phones, scrolling through Instagram timelines, refreshing Periscope live streams and watching Snapchat stories like it’s a reflex. If you wanted to, you could go a whole day knowing how your friends, classmates and that one person you once saw on Trousdale are spending their day in Trojanland.
But this new technology brings us new anxiety.
If there is one universal truth I have learned over these past 14 weeks spent writing about and talking to millennials, in addition to being one, it is that young 20-somethings constantly need a new lexicon to describe emerging feelings. The Oxford Dictionary added the word “FOMO” to the dictionary in 2013. FOMO, which stands for the “fear of missing out,” is the anxiety that makes millennials feel like they are missing out on an amazing event, quality time with friends or any other great opportunity that could come their way. It’s the desire to always stay in the know.
It’s the technology and the feeling that can make college students stay up at night with a glowing cell phone screen in their face, wondering if they should have actually gone to see Miguel at Conquest last week. With the continued conversation of mental health on campus, many psychologists are trying to minimize the FOMO.
Yet in these past 14 weeks I’ve also learned that FOMO is actually what students need to motivate them. It’s the perfect cure to senioritis, the affliction that sucks the motivation out of students nearing the end of their school experience. It became even clearer to me when I was sitting in the swelling crowd of the student section in the Coliseum on Saturday. This football season, I had missed more games than I had attended. More life experiences had popped up that stood paramount to spending a whole day tailgating and cheering in the Coliseum. Our football season felt like it was going into free fall, yet I had no choice. It was my last one as a student.
With this in mind, I booked it back to USC after the Thanksgiving holiday for the UCLA game. It might be my last opportunity to experience our crosstown rivals at the Coliseum. While some of my friends began trickling out of the Coliseum during halftime and later some after the lighting of the torch in the third quarter, I decided to stay.
It became one of the best decisions of my senior year. There’s no feeling like beating UCLA at home after spending the past three years falling short to them. I was glad I could cement that memory of a win against the Bruins.
Most adults will say that we need to disconnect. Yet, as some of us wind down our college careers in the next few weeks or come May for Commencement, millennials should use FOMO as a catalyst to soak in those college experiences. Like most things in the digital age, our undergraduate careers are fleeting. College passes by like a New York minute — even when you live in L.A.
We should want to document our “lasts.” We should accumulate the laundry list of the last football game, last lunch spent at Lemonade, last time sitting carefree in the Quad, last day of class, last finals season — OK, maybe not that one, but you get the point. This time next year, we seniors might not be living very close next to our friends.
If we can’t muster up the energy to leave our beds, take that one day off from our internship or forfeit a day of studying to really just be a full-fledged college student, then let that encroaching feeling of FOMO be your motivator. Be inspired to participate fully in the USC experience. Go see Laverne Cox speak at Bovard Auditorium on Thursday. Go to the 901 Bar and Grill on a Tuesday night, just because. Swing by Spudnuts afterward even though you should be home prepping for finals.
Do all of those things. Document those moments. Who knows when you or your friends will get to experience them as carefree young adults again.
That’s what’s so great about being a millennial. We’re rewriting all the rules of what it means to be a young adult. We can only do that by living. So next time you’re going through social media and seeing your friends participating in something great, don’t get jealous. Join the fun. You’ll never remember all those nights in Leavey studying, but you will remember the nights you stayed up and savored your time in college. That’s something you don’t want to miss out on.

Mugs make the perfect DIY holiday gift. Palak Patel | Daily Trojan
Before going home for winter break, many of us will find ourselves participating in a holiday gift exchange. Be it for a Secret Santa with coworkers or for a holiday dinner with friends, buying presents can often leave us feeling strapped for cash. To save you from this pre-holiday stress, I’ve compiled a list of five easy presents that will show your friends you care without breaking the bank.
Vanilla Coconut Body Scrub
For those friends who love to pamper, whip up a DIY body scrub. My personal favorite is a mixture of vanilla and coconut, which both smells delicious and leaves my skin feeling incredibly smooth. Simply combine half a cup of brown sugar with half a cup of coconut oil and 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Scoop the scrub into a mason jar and then attach a tag detailing the ingredients and directions for use.
DIY Mugs
These mugs are especially great if you don’t have the time to search for a unique present for each of your friends, but still want to personalize your gifts. They are easy to make, and the only necessary supplies are plain white mugs and ceramic paint. After picking these up, feel free to get creative and doodle something that would be meaningful to the person receiving the gift. 
Quote Board
This is the perfect DIY for those of us who aren’t particularly artistic. Just pick up a few pieces of plywood from your local hardware store (8×11 is ideal), and coat them twice with chalkboard paint. After letting everything dry, write a quote in your best script handwriting. When gifting, be sure to wrap the board carefully so that the quote doesn’t rub off!
Socks
Although most of us probably groaned when we received socks as children from an overbearing aunt, slipping on a pair of cute, fuzzy socks in the morning might be the best part of having to get ready for an 8 a.m. class. The key to making this present memorable is picking out a pair with a pattern that your friend or coworker will appreciate. I suggest browsing through Amazon, where you can find designs ranging from dinosaurs to tomato print. 
Manicure Kit
This gift is both incredibly easy to put together and to customize. Just grab a few mason jars and line the inside with cotton balls. Then add in nail polish in your friends’ favorite shades, and feel free to include a topcoat or glitter shade if you’d like. Also, pick up a pack of nail stickers, and divide it up so that there are a few stickers in each kit. Wrap each jar with a piece of ribbon, and your present is complete. 
The holiday season doesn’t have to be stressful for you or for your wallet. With these simple gift ideas, giving really can be more fun than receiving.

Lobsters weren’t quite the Thanksgiving meal we were used to, but we made do. Maya Anderman | Daily Trojan
It’s always weird spending a Thanksgiving away from home. The tradition of spending those few days with family while you stuff your face with turkey is a solidified routine for most Americans, so I really had no idea what to expect spending my first Thanksgiving in another country.
Because Thanksgiving doesn’t exist in the U.K., Christmas celebrations start extremely early. The minute it hits November 1, the streets are lit with twinkly lights, Michael Buble’s Christmas album plays on repeat and stores are filled to the brim with decorations. It was rather interesting trying to find a way to celebrate our favorite holiday in a place that had absolutely no care in the world that it was Thanksgiving.
Despite the challenges, my roommates and I did our best to live out the full Turkey Day experience. Unfortunately the day began to a rather gruesome start when we found a dead mouse in one of the mousetraps in our apartment (full disclosure to any students thinking to study abroad in London, this will most definitely happen to you at some point). After my roommate took one for the team and disposed of it, we began the day’s festivities.
After some research we decided to have our meal at a restaurant called Big Easy, which had a full Thanksgiving menu online, promising to serve all the American classics. Upon arriving at our destination, we found that we had booked our meal at a barbeque and lobster shack. Within minutes of sitting down our waiter handed us plastic lobster bibs, which I humorously and most willingly put on.  
It certainly wasn’t Mom’s cooking, but the meal was actually pretty good considering it was a British interpretation on an American holiday. The turkey came with delicious cranberry sauce, sweet potato mash and a green bean casserole. The only time it was quite apparent that Brits don’t know a proper Thanksgiving meal was when our stuffing hadn’t come to the table and after asking the waiter he pointed to the sweet potato mash and said “But isn’t that the stuffing right there?”
You have to give the Brits credit for the attempt, even if they don’t fully understand the holiday. It was perhaps the most American evening we’ve had in London, complete with pumpkin pie, country music and a paper turkey that we named Mr. Bingley and decided to take home with us. Walking home proudly with the turkey in arm, our obvious American demeanor prompted us to be stopped by an American woman who wanted to know how our first London Thanksgiving was. She told us that she’s lived in London for 13 years, but celebrating has never been as fun as celebrating in the States. Funny how a holiday can connect people no matter where you are in the world.
We ended the evening by hitting up our favorite local pub, which as a New Orleans themed bar, was also celebrating Thanksgiving. Their version of a Thanksgiving celebrating was selling five-Pound Wild Turkey bourbon cocktails (which we did end up trying and I can say with no remorse was absolutely disgusting). We ended up staying there till around 6 a.m. dancing and talking with owners and bartenders who work there.
Though it wasn’t the most “traditional” Thanksgiving, I still loved the whole day. It was one of the first times I really felt like an adult, being away from home and getting to celebrate the holiday with this newfound community I’ve made here in London. I Skyped into my mom’s 25-person dinner that night, and while it did make me miss my family, there was no part of me that really longed to be home. I was actually quite content being here in U.K., where I was able to celebrate the day in my own way.

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.  
A bubble. For exactly a year and three months, I was trapped in a bubble that my ex-boyfriend and I had enveloped ourselves in.
When someone suddenly comes running into your life, someone with whom you invest your time and emotions, it’s easy to become focused on that sole individual. They become your priority, on a level equal with, if not above school, friends and family. Looking back, it sounds foolish to revolve your world around one person. But that’s exactly what love can be. Stupid, foolish, consuming, yet also innocent, exhilarating and fulfilling. This person becomes your world, if even for a short period of time.
As our relationship got deeper he slowly became my everything, and I, his. My activities were rearranged around his availability, his friends and family put aside for spending time with me. It was worth it at that time, with every visit a comforting time of reassurance and support. We grew emotionally dependent on each other, safe within our bubble as long as we had each other. Whatever obstacle or frustration the world threw at us was fine. It seemed it would always be OK.
Until those within the bubble, began to break that bubble itself.
He made mistakes. I couldn’t forgive. He was passive. I was indecisive. In a relationship, the highs can launch you to incredible heights of bliss. The support of the one you love most can empower you with newfound confidence and self-esteem. Whenever I was stressed or discouraged, he pulled me back to my feet and kept me grounded. He and I created memories that I will always look back on fondly. Regardless of the aftermath, they were beautiful, innocent times of two souls who became enraptured with each other. On the opposite spectrum, the lows can be crushing. These lows have the ability to depress even the most optimistic and joyful of people. Though I treasure those times of young love, what I don’t miss are the times of distress over his lack of response, or the times of heartbreak I felt after he betrayed me with another girl. He crushed my soul and cast me into deep wells of depression time and time again, eventually overcoming the positive memories of the past. I gave him the power to influence my emotions, something that required a certain level of trust. My trust was misplaced, however, and the consequences were devastating.
After months of a downward spiral, things fell apart. I realized I was in too deep, too preoccupied with someone who did not value me or treat me the way I should be treated. The relationship was toxic, and my dependency on a person I could no longer trust was mentally and emotionally draining. The glass bubble we had built around ourselves crumbled, leaving me emotionally shattered with heartache that plagued me for months to come.
You hear those stories about individuals who fall into depression and become suicidal, people who are so broken that it takes them months to heal into an emotionally stable state. You never think that it might happen to you, but it’s the natural fallout of dependency. I had grown too dependent on my ex-boyfriend, and though I left him, I ended up emotionally struggling for months. For a long, dark time, it seemed like my life was without purpose. Not that I was at the point of self-harm, but I was a breathing shell, a zombie. I had lost sight of myself, my identity slipped away as he became my purpose. Even now, I sometimes slip back a few steps in my emotional state.
It’s dangerous to grow dependent on another person. Life is one heck of a curveball, and things can change so fast. In the blink of an eye, the only remnant of your time together may just be your memories. We can’t let our entire being be dictated by another person, someone who is also flawed and trying to figure out their own path in life. There are just so many things in our lives to focus on; we cannot just give them up if a relationship fails.
Without the support of my family and friends I would have been driven to the brink. If there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s to never grow dependent on someone to the point when you find yourself thinking you can’t survive without them. You lived a perfectly fine life before you met that person, and you will do the same even if they leave. You are you, beautiful autonomous you who has control of your own life. Don’t ruin a good today because of a bad yesterday.There is so much to live for, and I thankfully realized this when my bubble was broken. I will forever be grateful for friends and family who constantly reminded me of this, and also of the fact that my ex-boyfriend is also human. I don’t harbor intense bitterness towards him anymore; I pity him for letting go of a girl who loved him so much that she was willing to give him her all. Considering that however, ironically, I am thankful. Because he let me go, I realized that if I did continue to give him my all, I would have left nothing of myself, nothing of the former me for my friends, family, the world, and that’s something I cannot and will not accept. I hope he has come to realize this too not only for me, but also for himself. 
And here I am, enjoying and living life to the fullest. That isn’t to say to say there aren’t times that I miss him, or times when I wish I had someone special in my life. But what I value even more is my regained freedom to reconnect with friends, spend more time with family, explore the world, and pursue my passions. I will not be trapped in another bubble, nor put myself in such a vulnerable position. Independence is a beautiful thing, and it can be maintained even within a relationship. It’s just about making the right choices in forming relationships that are both healthy and happy. I really believe it’s possible, and I hope to do so with someone in the future. And once we do, the world itself will become our bubble, full of unlimited love and memories to be made.

Dear Tiffany, 
How much do our exes reflect on us? I began dating someone I’ve grown to love immensely for the past few months. However, his ex has been acting profoundly unstable since he and I got together. Recently, I had to change my phone number because she kept sending me pictures of her cutting herself and asking me why I “stole” him. She keeps threatening suicide unless he comes back to her, and he has to talk her out of these episodes, though I don’t feel comfortable with them talking. The other day, I found tons of dried bloody bandages taped on my door in the formation “F U”, and I think it was her, though I can’t prove it. I’ve also been receiving really threatening phone calls from anonymous numbers, though the voices are male, so I also can’t prove that she’s involved. I don’t want to report it because I’m worried it’ll tip her over the edge. She’s already tried to kill herself twice before, once by poisoning herself on my boyfriend’s lawn in the middle of the night. Her antics are having a devastating effect on our relationship, especially because I believe it would be better if he cut contact with her completely, which he refuses to do. I’m starting to be haunted by what it says about him that he could go out with someone like this for four years, which were by his admission, very happy in the beginning. Is it likely something is wrong with him too?
From,
Terrorized
I really hope this submission is some twisted play on a cult horror movie, but if not, this situation escalated out of normalcy long ago, and it is high time to do something.
The answer is not for your boyfriend to cut contact with his ex completely, contrary to what you wish. She is clearly volatile, desperate for attention and likely to inflict self-harm, a dangerous combination that shouldn’t be tested. Asking your boyfriend to choose between potentially saving her life or saving his relationship with you is selfish, and you are bound to lose. Your boyfriend doesn’t enjoy the routine crises of talking her down from the edge, but he is doing it because he feels like he has no other choice.
You are correct, however, when you say it should not be your boyfriend’s onus to protect his ex from herself, which is an emotionally exhausting and unsustainable responsibility. Someone who is better equipped to deal with this situation needs to get involved –– namely, a healthcare professional. His ex’s behavior is injurious and indicative of mental illness. She needs treatment. Counseling can also allow the two of you to get to a place where you aren’t haunted by the situation you’re going through. Your relationship with your boyfriend will only become more strained with every terrifying episode. 
The threats made against you are another reason to get her help, because the bandages and the phone calls are downright disturbing. Not to scare you, but if she is behind them, there is no telling what she might do next, given her current state of irrationality. If she is not behind them … In any case, I would report it.
Instead of being hung up on the fact that your boyfriend dated his ex for four years, be glad that you’re dating a compassionate person who isn’t turning his back on someone who is indubitably unhealthy. More than likely, his ex did not act like this when they were dating. A traumatic event, such as a hard breakup, can definitely spur a psychological breakdown. Until your boyfriend’s behavior gives you reason to believe something is off with him, don’t judge him by the actions of others.

Just a couple days after the Trojans defeated crosstown rival UCLA for the first time in four seasons, Clay Helton has been named the USC football program’s permanent head coach, athletic director Pat Haden announced Monday morning.
The 43-year old Helton, who previously took over on an interim basis for Steve Sarkisian on Oct. 12, guided the Trojans to a 5-2 record and a Pac-12 South title after the team started out the season with a 2-3 record. With his family beside him, he was officially introduced by Haden as USC’s long-term head coach in a press conference held at the John McKay Center on Monday. A number of Helton’s players, USC football staffers and athletic department administrators, in addition to USC President Max Nikias, were among those in attendance on Monday.
“After weeks of searching the collegiate and pro ranks, interviewing candidates and speaking with head coaches, athletic directors, NFL executives and very knowledgeable football people, and after observing Clay in action the past seven weeks, it became abundantly clear that what we were searching for in a coach was right here in front of us,” Haden said in a statement. “Choosing a coach is an inexact science. In Clay’s case, there is exactness,” Haden said. “We have a man with unquestioned integrity. He is a fantastic person, and he is real. Clay is a leader of young men. He is a terrific communicator. He brings high character, stability, continuity, consistency, toughness and resiliency to our program.”
Prior to becoming head coach, Helton, who has been at USC since 2010, served as the team’s quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. He is 6-2 all-time as a head coach at USC, having previously coached the Trojans to a victory over Fresno State in the 2013 Las Vegas Bowl.
“I am extremely humbled and grateful to Max Nikias, Pat Haden and the Trojan Family for having the opportunity to be the head football coach at the University of Southern California,” Helton said in a statement.
In his remarks, Helton apologized for not being glitzy, but believes that it’s a blue-collar mentality that wins championships, referencing the likes of former head coaches John McKay and Pete Carroll, and former players Marcus Allen and Ronnie Lott that once embodied that mentality.
“This place [USC] was founded on a blue-collar toughness, a toughness that I hope to emulate with my time here,” Helton said.
Helton said that he felt his last six years at USC has been a tremendous learning experience for him not only as coach, but as a person.
“During my six years here, I have learned the standard of excellence that it takes to be a Trojan. I understand the expectations of this great university and welcome the challenge. I am so proud to have the chance to lead what I feel is the pinnacle of college football and to represent our Trojan Family.”
Helton and his team now look forward to representing USC in the cardinal and gold’s first ever Pac-12 Championship Game appearance at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara on Saturday.
“Through the hard work and resiliency of this year’s team, we have put ourselves in position to play for a Pac-12 Championship,” Helton said. “I would like to thank our players and coaches for the effort and dedication that they have given to this season. It has been my most memorable as a coach.”
The Men of Troy will get a chance at redemption against No. 7-ranked Stanford after the Cardinal handed them their first loss of the season, 41-31, at the Coliseum back in September. A win against Stanford would send the Trojans to their first Rose Bowl since 2009.
“Clay was not hired because his team defeated UCLA Saturday,” Haden said. “He was not hired because many current and former players voiced their support for him. And he was not hired because he is a Trojan. He is our choice because we believe he can win Pac-12 and national championships here. Clay Helton is the right man at the right time for the USC football program.”
According to Haden, Helton signed a five-year guaranteed contract to coach the Trojans on Sunday, though, the exact details of the agreement were not disclosed. The 62-year-old athletic director expressed his full support for his new head coach and said that he has been impressed with how the team was inspired by him and supported him.
“We have known Clay well for the past six years. He earned this opportunity. He has been positive and upbeat handling adversity. He was built to be a head coach,” Haden said. “Football is his family business. He is a coach on the rise and he will be coaching a team on the rise. As our interim head coach, Clay brought back USC’s style of physical football.”
Under Helton, the Trojans have established a run-first identity on offense, having outrushed their opponents in each game by an average of about 140 yards since he took over. They’ve been able to control the ball, winning the the time-of-possession battle in every game except Colorado and also have a plus-nine turnover margin under Helton.
During that time, Helton has accumulated unconditional support from his players, who joyously celebrated and continuously chanted his name after Haden announced in their team meeting that he was going to become their permanent head coach.
“I will never forget the reaction our players had in my entire life,” Helton said.
Helton becomes the second head coaching hire made by Haden, who previously called on Sarkisian in December 2013 to take the helm. Following the announcement, many USC players took to social media to express their approval of Haden’s decision to retain Helton.
“[Thank] you Pat Haden! I wish I had more years left under Coach Helton,” senior redshirt senior defensive tackle Antwaun Woods said on Twitter. “I will definitely enjoy these next few games! #Helton2016.”
Before coming to USC, Helton spent 10 years as an assistant at Memphis and served in the same capacity at Houston and Duke prior.
After Helton’s introductory press conference on Monday, Haden said that he interviewed several candidates and current Philadelphia Eagles head coach Chip Kelly was not one of those interviewed.
