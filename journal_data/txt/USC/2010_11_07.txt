Sunday was a day of championship matches on both the East and West Coasts for the USC men’s tennis team.
No. 7 seed junior Steve Johnson fell short in his bid to repeat as champion of the USTA/ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships in Flushing, N.Y., to Tennessee’s sophomore Rhyne Williams. Williams defeated Johnson in the Round of 16 of the NCAA singles competition in May.
After winning the first set 6-1, Johnson was not able to pull off the victory, falling short 1-6, 4-6 in the final two sets.
“I came out to a really good start,” Johnson said. “The second set got away from me a bit, and I had chances in the third set, but I just didn’t capitalize.”
Johnson was ahead 4-3 in the third set with a couple chances to break Williams’ serve. Williams broke in the next game at 4-4, for the decisive advantage.
“It was a bit unfortunate for Steve,” associate head coach George Husack said. “He fended off one match point but could not hold off Williams.”
Overall, Johnson’s performance in the tournament solidified his status as a force to be reckoned with in college tennis.
“Steve was on his game,” said Husack of his play throughout the weekend. “He proved he is one of the best players in the country, but he also proved that his is not invincible. For him, last year [winning the tournament] was unexpected. This year, he was expected to compete, and that brings about more pressure. He did a great job all week, but he had a couple of bad breaks at the end.”
Even with the disappointing end to his tournament, Johnson relished the opportunity to play at Flushing Meadows.
“It’s fantastic. New York is a great environment for tennis,” Johnson said. “It is kind of an honor to play at the site of the U.S. Open.”
Senior Jaak Poldma and sophomore JT Sundling also had busy days with two matches to decide championships at the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships at the Los Angeles Tennis Center in Westwood, Calif.
No. 2 Poldma and Sundling won 8-5 in the doubles main draw final against No. 1-seeded Hugh Clarke and Alex Llompart of Pepperdine to start off the day.
Poldma continued his winning ways in the championship match of the singles main draw against UCLA’s Maxime Tabatruong in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2.
Sundling barely lost in the singles consolation final against freshman Daniel Kosakowski of UCLA in a third set super tie break 3-6, 6-4, 10-8.
“It’s always fun to go to UCLA and win,” coach Peter Smith said. “We played some good tennis, and we have been doing the right thing. Thursday we had some tough matches, but it was great to see Jaak get his name in the record books with two wins.”
Poldma has not always achieved success during the fall season, but Smith mentioned he gave a tough and opportunistic effort that provided a good example for the rest of his teammates.
The pair of Sundling and Poldma provide Smith with an option that combines the best talents of each individual.
“It’s a team I’ve always liked,” said Smith. “They are different players who can help each other. JT is strong at the net, while Jaak has an intensity that JT can feed off of.“

Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott held a press conference this weekend to release the 2011 schedule of the newly formed Pac-12 football conference.
Starting next year, Utah and Colorado will be joining the Pac-10, making it the Pac-12, and will consequently split the conference into two subdivisions: the Pac-12 North and the Pac-12 South.
On top of releasing the 2011 Pac-12 schedule, Scott also revealed the Pac-12’s plan to implement an eight-year rotation model to be used for future scheduling that, according to Scott, “maintains important traditional rivalries, and will create some very exciting matchups in our new 12-team conference.”
The 2011 seaon kicks off Sept. 3, 2011  and conference matchups begin the following week as USC hosts Pac-12 newcomer Utah Sept. 10, 2011.  The season will culminate with the first-ever Pac-12 championship game, to be played on the home field of the division champion with the best overall conference record.
The 2012 schedule will include the same set of opponents as the 2011 schedule but the games would be played at the home fields opposite of the year before.
Other home games for the Trojans next year include Washington, Stanford, and bitter rival UCLA.

Saturday’s exhibition game against Point Loma Nazarene was the first opportunity for fans to see the Trojans’ freshmen play in a non-scrimmage situation at the Galen Center, and if freshman guard Bryce Jones was nervous to play in front of the USC crowd, he did not show it. Jones entered the game and instantly made a three-pointer in each of his first two possessions.
“It was a real big confidence-booster to hit the first two shots,” Jones said. “I saw that I was hot, so I thought I should keep shooting.”
Jones did keep shooting, and connected on his first four three-point attempts in the first half. He finished with 17 points and three rebounds in only 19 minutes, helping the Trojans win 69-49.
“I thought Bryce played really well in the first half,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “He is going to be a really, really good player. It is going to take him a little bit of time, but he has made huge strides. He is eventually going to be a knock-down shooter, as well as a guy who can get to the basket and make plays.”
Jones was not the only freshman who stood out for USC. Maurice Jones started at point guard and accumulated seven points, a game-high six assists and only one turnover. Neither Garrett Jackson nor Curtis Washington scored in brief action.
Senior forward Alex Stepheson had a game-high 19 points for the Trojans, despite only making three of 10 free throws. Junior forward Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 16 rebounds, and senior guard Marcus Simmons added six points and eight rebounds.
“I think we are definitely a couple steps ahead of where we were last year,” Stepheson said. “The chemistry is better, which goes a long way. We have confidence in each other, and we are a unit instead of a bunch of individuals.”
Defensively, the Trojans managed to contain the Sea Lions. Point Loma Nazarene’s two leading scorers, forwards James Hancock and Todd Campbell, who came into to the game averaging a combined 31 points per game, finished with two points in the first half, and six total points. USC held the Sea Lions to a 29.8 shooting percentage.
The exhibition gave O’Neill an opportunity to analyze his squad before USC opens the regular season on Saturday. Despite starting the game on an 11-1 run and the 20-point margin of victory, O’Neill said he found areas that his team needs to improve in.
“We are going to be a work in progress for a while. We have depth issues, but that is not something that any of us did not already know,” O’Neill said. “We have to make sure that we are improving at a steady pace.”
The Trojans will open regular-season competition on Saturday against UC-Irvine.

The lights flashed as the members of Dr. Dog stepped onto the stage at The Wiltern, casting them in orange, red, purple, blue and green lights. As they walked out, clad in sunglasses and goofy-looking orange beanies, they wasted no time onstage before setting up and whipping out their first dizzyingly energetic jam.
Dr. Dog might be acoustic-driven indie pop, but there was no doubt about it: these boys came to rock ‘n’ roll. The crowd at The Wiltern on Friday night responded with enthusiasm as loud and joyous as the music itself.
Performing among a large crowd of music lovers, Dr. Dog gave the crowd its money’s worth — if not more — for doing one thing correctly: providing an entertaining show. Waiting barely seconds between each song, Dr. Dog catapulted the audience into each number with its full force.
Save for the occasional declaration of “This is a new song we’ve got for you tonight,” the show was mainly talk-free. The band seemed to know that concertgoers like seeing tight, well-rehearsed musical numbers — not a mess of comedic attempts and endless talking. And tight, well-rehearsed numbers were exactly what the band members delivered.
Although the band’s albums are filled with harmonies reminiscent of the Beatles and old-timey piano chords, Dr. Dog’s ability to play a show throbbing with sound is also just as strong, and its live performances are something to see.
For those who have only heard the band’s albums, the sheer power of its shows might be shocking compared to the upbeat, poppy sounds on the records. Still, somehow it works onstage and even meshes the two sides of the band together.
Dr. Dog’s mix of rock ‘n’ roll and indie pop is even exemplified in the styles of its two lead singers — Scott McMicken’s voice is gruff and strong and Toby Leaman is more of a Vampire Weekend-inspired artist, taking vocal cues from lighter pop styles. When the two come together, it’s the perfect combination of everything that Dr. Dog seems to do right: the perfect middle ground is reached between bluesy rock ’n’ roll and quirky, psychedelic indie pop.
Though McMicken and Leaman play off of each other’s voices, the blending of styles is also seen in the very music itself. Dr. Dog’s melodies are harmonic and carefree, yet the band is able to achieve rock-your-socks-off status. Everything about them is light, funky and fun, but they do it with an attitude that forces their listeners to rock hard.
And this mix between pop and rock, light and heavy, is exactly what Dr. Dog supplied to its grateful audience at The Wiltern.
Although songs such as “The Rabbit, The Bat & The Reindeer” were joyous and performed with vigor and excitement, even the more serious “The Ark” was passionate and alive despite is calmer demeanor on the album.
The band played many songs from its newest album, Shame, Shame, which has the same 1970s style as its other albums such as We All Belong and Fate, but with what seems to be an even peppier attitude.
With Shame, Shame, it appeared as if Dr. Dog was wisely focusing its melodies and pop-rock sound; its Wiltern show only served to lend credence to that theory. Unlike so many bands that sound excellent in the studio, but falter onstage, Dr. Dog’s appearance at The Wiltern might have even outshone its latest studio sound.
Classics like “We All Belong” and newer songs like “Shadow People” were equally wonderful, and the crowd seemed to cheer for new Dr. Dog even more than it did for its original hit “Worst Trip.”
Although the band didn’t rely on flashy aesthetics and crazy costumes, there was something downright cool about the look of Dr. Dog’s performance: one guitar, covered in different colors of painted spots, glowed underneath ultraviolet rays while multicolored lights showed these musicians off to the crowd. The band members didn’t dress up, but they also didn’t dress down. Despite their cool sunglasses and funny-looking hats, they made it clear that this night was all about the music and not some extravagant visual performance.
The two opening bands — Here We Go Magic and Good Old War — were musically interesting and also put on a great show, but there is something refreshing about seeing a band that can create such amazing sounds in front of an audience, sounds that are even stronger and more passionate than the ones they had all the time in the studio to perfect.
Dr. Dog’s live performance was vibrant and filled with a love for music so many musicians forget about when onstage. It was about melody, energy and passion. And at a live concert, it seems as if one couldn’t ask for anything more.
I’ve been a fan of Dr. Dog for years and yes, you’ve nailed it in this article but what you do not mention is they have a new drummer named Eric Slick who is a young prodigy, so much so that he formerly played with King Crimson and Pearl Jam.  He has only been with the band since January and does not appear on any of the records except for the four brand new singles they released but it is evident that he has transformed Dr. Dog from a good band into one of the world’s greatest live bands out there right now.  If you pay attention, he’s the real reason that Dr. Dog’s live shows are so spectacular.  I attended their east coast gigs and because I am a drummer myself, I was interested to see the “new guy”.  My jaw was on the floor.  Watch some of the You Tubes, especially the one from the Craig Ferguson show last week, and you will see what I mean.

As the USC women’s soccer team wound up its regular season with a weekend road trip to Arizona, its two matches had noticably different storylines.
It didn’t start well at all for the No. 17 Women of Troy (12-5-3, 5-3-1), as they were ambushed by the Arizona State Sun Devils (9-6-3, 3-4-1) on Friday, taking a 3-0 loss.
“Nothing went our way,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “Not the whistle, not the ball — nothing.”
Arizona State scored on a penalty kick in the sixth minute, setting the tone of the game. The Women of Troy were called for 11 fouls in the first half, and 20 for the game. On the other side, the whistle blew 11 times against Arizona State.
“We got called for that penalty kick early and just never recovered from it,” Khosroshahin said.
With less than one minute remaining in the half, Arizona State found the back of the net again, this time off a corner kick. It was representative of a half dominated by the Sun Devils. Arizona State racked up five shots — all on goal — and three corner kicks, while USC did not force a single corner and managed just three shots, none on goal.
“We dug ourselves a hole quickly,” Khosroshahin said. “But we’re used to it. We’ve been doing it all season.”
To the Women of Troy’s credit, they came back strong in the second half.
“2-0 is a very dangerous score,” senior forward Megan Ohai said. “We knew if we came out strong we had a good chance.”
And come out strong they did. During a three-minute stretch from the 54th to the 57th minute, the Women of Troy forced four consecutive corner kicks but could only get off one shot during that span.
“We dominated possession in the second half,” Khosroshahin said. “The ball was on their half of the field almost the entire time.”
In the 67th minute, USC was awarded a penalty kick of its own, but senior forward Alyssa Dávila was stoned by Arizona State goalkeeper Alyssa Gillmore. Just three minutes later, Arizona State scored again to put the game away.
“It stings, but we need to recover quickly,” Khosroshahin said. “We need to be smarter and more disciplined.”
Ohai thought the loss helped resharpen her team’s focus.
“We have a young team, and we just got rattled out there,” Ohai said. “It was a big wake up call for us. We [knew] we [had] to take care of business on Sunday.”
And that they did. On Sunday in Arizona, the Women of Troy overwhelmed the Arizona Wildcats (5-13-2, 1-8) by a lopsided score a 5-0. In just the third minute, sophomore midfielder Courtney Garcia found the back of the net. Ninety seconds later, Dávila joined the scoring party. The early goals were a change of pace for USC, whose slow starts in games have been a chronic issue for the team this season.
“It was really nice to get those two goals early so I could catch my breath,” Khosroshahin said. “The ladies felt the pressure, and it’s really amazing what a team can do when it’s focused and motivated.”
Sophomore forward Samantha Johnson, freshman forward midfielder Autumn Altamirano and junior forward Ashley Freyer also found the net for USC, whose five goal output tied its high for the season. The five-goal margin of victory, however, was USC’s most lopsided win since 2008. Freshmen goalkeeper Shelby Church recorded her sixth shutout of the season, and the Women of Troy all but assured themselves a spot in the NCAA tournament.
“We knew we needed a result,” Dávila said.
Senior defender Karter Haug agreed.
“We had a ‘win or go home’ mentality,” Haug said. “It was good preparation for the tournament — a real confidence booster.”
The Women of Troy end the regular season with a 12-5-3 record and finish third in the Pac-10 at 5-3-1. The team awaits its fate in the NCAA tournament bracket, which will be announced on ESPNU today at 1:30 p.m.

In front of easily the most raucous crowd to squeeze into McDonald’s Swim Stadium all year, the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (20-2, 4-2) defeated No. 3 UCLA for the third time this season, 8-5.
From the beginning, the Trojans managed to quiet the smattering of powder-blue fans hungry for an upset, amassing a 4-1 lead at the end of the first half. Though in the previous two games against the Bruins the Trojans had squandered early leads, they would never trail in this game.
Entering this matchup, team leaders such as junior two-meter Matt Burton — who scored one goal and blocked several dangerous UCLA shots — emphasized a need to shore up the team defense, believing it was not yet championship-caliber and on par with the Trojans’ prolific offense. USC coach Jovan Vavic noticed a defensive tenacity in this game that has sometimes been lacking this season.
Three cheers · Sophomore driver Tobias Preuss scored three times for the Trojans on Saturday, leading USC to an 8-5 victory over UCLA. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“The guys hustled,” Vavic said. “We were quick to loose balls and we were quick to help each other. We really did a great job in just pressing the two-meter men, not letting them get the ball. Aside from the fourth quarter where we fell asleep for a couple of possessions, it was a great team effort.”
Of course, the all-MPSF goaltending of junior Joel Dennerley helped bail the team out of defensive breakdowns, as he denied all manners of shots — lob, skip, or straight — with 12 saves on the afternoon. Not only was Dennerley impressed with the team’s defensive effort but also its toughness. In an earlier loss to Stanford, some suggested that the Cardinal’s physicality posed problems for the younger, smaller Trojans.
“It’s always a physical matchup against the crosstown rivals,” Dennerley said. “We were pumped up before the game and just took it to them, giving everything we’ve got. We matched up well against some bigger guys.”
On the offensive side, two young Trojans — freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie and sophomore driver Tobias Preuss — combined to score five goals. UCLA defenders punished Davie all afternoon with kicks and elbows while he was planted in front of their net. However, the Australian persevered, scoring two goals to add to his team lead in that category. Preuss, who recorded a hat-trick, played his best game of the season.
“Tobias was very fired up for this game. His couple of goals early in the game really set the tone. I think he actually hurt their goalie’s confidence early,” Vavic said. “Jeremy did not have a great game against UCLA up north, where he picked up three early ejection fouls. But he was outstanding [in this game]. He established great position in two-meters, scored two goals and fought really hard.”
Having recorded four consecutive victories against UCLA dating back to last season, the Trojans are brimming with confidence. Still, they are aware that, should they see the Bruins again in the postseason, these victories are largely irrelevant; UCLA will not simply wilt.
“We’re getting toward the end of the season and we know the stakes are higher in the finals,” Dennerley said. “If we happen to match up against UCLA, we’re confident we can beat them. But they’re still a great team, and we’ll need to take our games to a higher level.”
To cap off the day, the fans that did not bolt to the USC-Arizona State football game saw the Trojans’ reserves simply overpower an unranked Whittier team, 16-1. The nonconference game marked the second time this season that USC defeated the Poets.
In its last home game of the season on Thursday at 5 p.m., the team will face No. 10 Pepperdine.

The setup: After a lopsided defeat at the hands of the No. 1 Oregon Ducks, the Trojans entered Saturday’s game against Arizona State wanting to redeem themselves and show that they still had something to play for.
The story: In a season where the Trojans just couldn’t catch a break, Saturday was the night that the ball finally bounced their way when senior kicker Joe Houston nailed a 29-yard field goal to lift the Trojans to a 34-33 victory.
“We never doubted him,” sophomore safety T.J. McDonald said. “He makes those kicks all the time in practice. He missed a couple and that’s a great job for him to respond. For the way he responded, we have the utmost respect for him.”
The first half lacked scoring, but there was plenty of other excitement that came from USC’s defense, which looked alive and kept the Sun Devils’ offense in check, recording four sacks in the first half.
The play of the defense and special teams kept the Trojans in the game until the offense finally got into a rhythm that would become evident in the second half.
Wild third quarter: Arizona State drove down the field effortlessly to begin the third quarter, but one bad throw by Sun Devils quarterback Steven Threet allowed senior linebacker Malcolm Smith to pick off his errant pass and return it 74 yards for a touchdown.
And just as it seemed the Trojans had momentum, the Sun Devils snatched it away, responding every time to silence the crowd and keep themselves in the game. Both teams traded scores until Sun Devils cornerback LeQuan Lewis took the kickoff 100 yards, cutting the Trojans lead to a single possession again, 29-21.
That concluded the third quarter, but the Sun Devils would carry the momentum into the final quarter. Another interception return for a touchdown — this time, it was by Sun Devils cornerback Omar Bolden — cut the Trojans’ deficit again to a single score and it wasn’t too long before they seized the lead at 29-33 midway through the fourth quarter on a Threet pass to wide receiver Jamal Miles.
Special teams: In the first half, McDonald had a hand in blocking one punt, and also deflected another. In the second half, the Trojans again gave their offense a chance to win when junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith blocked a crucial field goal in the fourth quarter that redshirt freshman cornerback Torin Harris returned for a two-point conversion. This ultimately set up the game-winning heroics for Houston.
“Special teams … a lot of people don’t really get it, but it determines a lot of the outcome,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said.
Third time’s the charm: in an up-and-down game that saw the Trojans take a 15-point lead, give it up and then take it back, Houston redeemed himself with a game-winning 29-yard field goal. After missing two field goals earlier in the game, Houston managed to stay confident.
“My team put me in the position to execute my job,” Houston said. “That kick was for my teammates.”
After being on the wrong side of last-second kicks, the Trojans ended up being on the right side on Saturday.
“All in all, after what we’ve gone through in the last four games prior to this … we’re just happy to get a win right now,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “I’m so pleased for our players and their effort.”

With the waning minutes of the fourth quarter ticking off the clock, the Trojans line up to try and stop a field goal attempt that would put their opponent ahead with little time left in the game.
The players are exhausted, having just scraped back into the lead on the previous drive. Coaches and fans are hit with a different emotion, one of terror and anxiety at the notion that they are about to witness last-minute heartbreak yet again, despite the Trojans’ best efforts to stop it.
The ball is snapped and the kick is up, sailing past the line of defensive players, headed straight for the uprights.
Sound familiar?
It should, because outside of USC’s game against Oregon, this exact scenario has been the sole reason the Trojans sit at 3-3 and in a tie for fifth place in the Pac-10. It’s the difference between an AP Top 25 ranking and a season written off as a “rebuilding period.” It’s the margin of victory that could erode what a decade of success had built for a program once synonymous with the word “dynasty.”
But as that ball sailed toward the goal posts, a funny thing happened: It missed, hooking wide left, and the Coliseum breathed an unfamiliar sigh of relief.
Call it what you want, but the missed field goal at the end of Saturday’s game against Arizona State that allowed the Trojans to hold onto victory was the one thing USC hasn’t encountered all season — a break.
Sure, you could pin the win on the Trojans’ clutch special teams play — the unit blocked two punts, returned a blocked PAT attempt for two points and converted a 29-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter to take a 34-33 lead. But then again, special teams also allowed a kick return touchdown and missed two close-range field goals.
The Trojan defense is in the same boat: Though it held the Sun Devils to seven points in the first half and intercepted Arizona State quarterback Steven Threet for a touchdown in the third quarter, it also broke down in coverage several times late in the game, ultimately allowing the Sun Devils the opportunity to take the lead with a late field goal.
There were plenty of exciting, back-and-forth moments that ended up swinging the final result in USC’s favor, but any further examination of Saturday’s events leads to the sole conclusion that the Trojans finally just got lucky.
For once, it was the opponent’s kicker, not USC’s, who missed the clutch field goal. For once, it was USC’s kicker, not the opponent’s, who made the clutch field goal. And for either of those events to be relevant only because of a blocked extra point try that led to a three-point swing for the Trojans? You can’t make this stuff up.
There are plenty of things to still be concerned about as a USC fan, and by no means was Saturday’s win a pretty one. But football can be a sloppy sport even when the best teams are involved. At those points, games are won or lost depending on the way the ball bounces.
Just look at No. 5 Louisiana State University, who failed to score a touchdown in the final seconds against Tennessee a month ago only to be granted a re-do because the Volunteers accidentally put too many players on the field. The Tigers went on to score on the next play, win the game and stay undefeated.
Or how about No. 9 Nebraska, who did everything possible to lose its game on Saturday against a mind-numbingly average Iowa State and yet still came out with a win? The Cyclones took the Cornhuskers into overtime, scored a touchdown, then even had a man wide open in the end zone for the game-winning two-point conversion, only to have a terrible pass get intercepted by Nebraska to somehow seal the victory.
Think those teams will take the win, luck included?
For a team up to its neck in adversity, USC’s victory over Arizona State isn’t just welcome — it’s necessary. Coach Lane Kiffin and the Trojans would obviously have preferred to close out the match with a showing of brute force and flawless play, but they didn’t. Still, you won’t hear anyone in Heritage Hall complaining about the way things turned out.
With the final stretch of games on the horizon for the depleted Trojans, finishing ball games in whatever manner possible is an absolute must, even if the path to victory happens to be paved by an opponent’s mistake.
Luckily for Kiffin and USC, this wasn’t a case of déjà vu all over again. And they’ll gladly take it.

The Trojans finally saw a late field goal go their way.
Two in fact.
USC senior place kicker Joe Houston kicked the game-winning 29-yard field goal a few minutes before Arizona State’s place kicker Thomas Weber hooked left a 42-yard attempt, ensuring a 34-33 USC win and ending the Trojans’ penchant for letting close games slip through their grasp.
Coming into Saturday’s game against the Sun Devils, the Trojans had lost three of their last four, including two heart-breaking losses on late field goals against Washington and Stanford and a deflating beat-down by Oregon last week.
On step ahead · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley threw for 215 yards and three touchdowns on 26 for 37 passing but was also picked off twice. The Trojans took a 34-33 lead on a late field goal and held on for the win after Arizona State missed a field goal of its own from 42 yards out. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
“I really kind of felt like… ‘finally,’” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We just hadn’t had many breaks go our way throughout the year. … It was really good for our players just to see them have something go their way.”
Houston was especially thankful for the redemption. The kicker missed two first-half kicks of 27 and 35 yards, but came through as USC trailed 31-33 with just more than three minutes remaining on the clock.
“I’m human. I was anxious,” Houston said. “But I believe in myself, I believe in my teammates.”
Houston, who is six for 12 on field goal attempts this year, said the kick was for his teammates.
“I believe in Joe, I’ve believed in him this whole year,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said.
A lot of pieces had to fall in place in the buildup to Houston’s game-winning kick. A tame first half turned into a wacky second, defined by huge plays on special teams and defensive touchdowns.
Three point-after-touchdown plays tipped the balance in the Trojans’ favor. After senior linebacker Malcolm Smith returned an interception 74 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter, the Trojans converted a two-point conversion on a pass from senior quarterback Mitch Mustain to senior wide receiver David Ausberry.
Next, the Sun Devils lined up to go for two after an interception return for a touchdown by cornerback Omar Bolden, hoping to tie the Trojans at 29. But USC’s pass rush sacked Sun Devil quarterback Steven Threet.
After Arizona State scored the go-ahead touchdown on a nine-yard pass from Threet to wide receiver Jamal Miles, USC junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith blocked the point-after try and redshirt freshman cornerback Torin Harris caught the ball on a hop and sprinted for the opposite end zone.
Instead of going up 34-29, the Sun Devils’ lead was cut to 33-31 and the momentum was back on the Trojans’ sideline.
These were just a few of the key special teams plays filling up a game that had many, which included two blocked punts (one partially) by sophomore safety T.J. McDonald and a 100-yard kickoff return by Arizona State’s LeQuan Lewis.
Special teams turned out to be crucial for a Trojan team that has put more focus on that aspect of the game under special teams coach John Baxter.
“It’s a third of the game,” Houston said. “In games like this, you really see that special teams execution is critical.”
On the game’s first drive, the Sun Devils caught the Trojans off guard when Threet tossed a lateral to Miles. Miles launched the ball to a wide-open wide receiver T.J. Simpson for a 54-yard gain.
Threet found wide receiver Gerell Robinson on a 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone to cap the 72-yard, three minute drive.
The Trojans’ defense stiffened up after that, however, holding Arizona State scoreless the rest of the first half. The Trojans held Threet, who led the Pac-10 with 268 passing yards per game prior to Saturday, to just 228 yards and intercepted him twice. Threet threw three touchdowns.
Barkley, along with the rest of the USC offense, had an up-and-down game, finishing 26-of-37 for 215 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions.
Barkley missed a streaking freshman wide receiver Robert Woods for what looked to be a sure touchdown on his first pass of the game. Kiffin said that might have thrown his quarterback off.
“I’m sure it took him a while to get over the first play,” Kiffin said. “It took me a while to get over it.”
Tyler, who left the game in the fourth quarter with an ankle sprain, led the Trojans on the ground with 119 yards on 12 carries.
After a late night at the Coliseum, the Trojans were just happy to find themselves on the winning side of a late-game field goal.
“We know what it feels like to be on the other side of the ball now,” Wright said.
Added Kiffin: “All in all, after what we’ve gone through in the last four games prior to this — you know the two last-second losses and the Oregon game — we’re just happy to get a win right now.”
Thats was a cardio win for sure…great job TROJANS!!

Elizabeth Jordan, a doctoral student studying education, signed up to be a bone marrow donor in 2002. The chances of her marrow matching a patient in need of a transplant were one in 20,000, but Jordan still signed the forms and sent in a cheek swab.
Six years later, she received a phone call.
“They asked me if I remembered when I signed up to be a donor way back in 2002. It took me a while, but I finally said, ‘Oh yeah,’” Jordan said.
After Jordan donated her marrow, she learned how big of a difference she made.
“I donated my bone marrow in 2008 and my stem cells saved the life of a 46-year-old woman with leukemia who had no other chance for survival,” Jordan said.
The woman whom Jordan saved is Rhonda Christensen, a research scientist and instructor at the University of North Texas living more than 1,500 miles away.
“I was in tears. … I was so grateful. Most of the folks never find a match,” Christensen said. “Elizabeth is my angel of life.”
Fifty percent of the people who sign up change their minds about donating if they are contacted, Jordan said.
Christensen and Jordan now possess the same blood type. By donating her marrow, Jordan gained not only a blood relative but also another family, she said.
“When I first met Rhonda … her father came up to me and whispered in my ear, ‘Thank you for giving me my daughter back,’” Jordan said.
This experience inspired Jordan to become a member of the National Bone Marrow Program and organize a bone marrow drive at USC. The first drive — held last year — resulted in one match, she said.
Building off that success, Jordan launched a second drive that took place on Friday and enlisted more than 100 students to sign up — approximately 25 percent more students than last year, she said.
On Saturday, Jordan, drive participants and other Trojan volunteers walked five kilometers in the “Be the One Run” fundraiser walk in Long Beach, Calif. The team, called “Walkers 4 Life,” represented USC at the event.
Janice Chan, a San Francisco State graduate and drive volunteer, said, like Christensen, a bone marrow transplant saved her life.
Diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2005, Chan  underwent numerous rounds of chemotherapy before relapsing, leaving a bone marrow transplant as her only option.
“I got a transplant in December of 2006 from an anonymous donor in Hong Kong. It is important for more minorities to donate because it increases diversity and the chances for a match,” Chan said.
Chan said the donation procedure rarely includes surgery and is usually not painful.
“We have thorough screening and don’t have someone donate if there is the slightest risk,” she said.
Mario Mottley, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, was one of the many students who signed up Friday.
“It is always a joy; life is a great gift and anytime you can preserve it you should,” Mottley said.
Seventy-five percent of patients seeking a life-saving match will die searching, said Raquel Amezquita, a community outreach specialist for the National Marrow Donor Program.
“College students are on the brink of their future and can’t think that far in advance.” Amezquita said. “Signing up today [can] save a life years later.”
Jordan said that the simple choice to sign up for a good cause gave her a more positive outlook on life.
“I continue to be amazed and in awe of how one small decision I made could have such a profound ripple effect,” Jordan said.

Jewish and Muslim students came together on Sunday to participate in community service projects throughout Los Angeles as part of an international effort to build relationships between the two religions.
The event, “Encountering the Other: Muslim-Jewish Day of Service,” was part of the third annual Weekend of Twinning of Mosques and Synagogues, which was first created in 2008 by the New York-based Foundation for Ethnic Understanding in order to increase communication and cooperation between Muslim and Jewish communities worldwide.
USC Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said the Weekend of Twinning is an important event that brings together more than 200 mosques and synagogues in the United States.
“Jews and Muslims in the United States face similar challenges in terms of combating anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, and they also share core religious values, such as their commitment to justice and service,” Soni wrote in an e-mail.
At USC, members of the Ansar Service Partnership and USC Hillel came together to host this service-oriented event, with support from the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement, USC Muslim Student Union, Office of Religious Life, Interfaith Council and the Undergraduate Student Government.
Jessica Youseffi, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism and a student organizer at Hillel, said the idea for hosting this event came from a conversation she had with Rabbi Lori Schneide, director of Jewish life at Hillel.
The two approached Sarrah Shahawy, student president of the Interfaith Council and interfaith coordinator of the Ansar Service Partnership, who they said was very enthusiastic about the idea.
“We all inherently believe in building relationships on campus,” Youseffi said.
Throughout the course of the day, the students participated in a hunger walk, a beach clean-up, a blood drive and other activities. After, they shared a late lunch where they studied sacred texts and reflected on the commonalities of their respective religions.
Schneide said she hoped this event would create a lasting legacy of service between Muslim and Jewish students on campus.
“Our religions are so similar in so many ways,” Schneide said. “The concept of a common ground is really the future for us to be able to go forward with a vision for the global community.”
In an era marked by tension between the two religious groups on a global scale, the event organizers and supporters said they hoped this will better promote interfaith understanding.
“This event was designed to help create an occasion for two groups whose relationship is strained to come together around shared concerns and allow individuals to experience ‘the other’ in a personal way,” wrote Brie Loskota, managing director of the USC Center for Religion and Civic Culture, in an e-mail.
This service day is the first in a series of planned joint service projects between Muslim and Jewish students on campus this year.
Hillel students plan on joining the Ansar Service Partnership on their bimonthly food distributions and Muslim students have been invited to Hillel on Friday to help out with a toy drive.
“I really feel that this form of interfaith work is the most effective,” Youseffi said. “In doing service we unite together and in some ways that takes out the ‘other’ in each other.”
Shahawy agreed.
“This is a great way for us to show the reality of the similarities we share,” she said. “We hope events like this will continue.”
What parallels in Christianity of Judaism are there to this?

Though almost 40 years have passed since his monumental rise to rock stardom, there still exists an impenetrably mysterious aura that surrounds glam rock star David Bowie.
His dazzling stage costumes, his fascination with the intergalactic unknown and his ever-changing stage personas have all been given limited explanation over the years by the typically reserved rocker.
British film studio Sexy Intellectual tackles the daunting task of crafting a documentary that illuminates not only the historical factors behind Bowie’s successful reign in the music world, but also that of rock industry giants Iggy Pop and Lou Reed.

By intertwining the three stories to show the inspiration these three men drew from one another in crafting their stage personas, The Sacred Triangle: Bowie, Iggy & Lou: 1971-1973 attempts not to reveal the myths behind this holy trinity of rockers, but to allow viewers to gain a greater appreciation of each artist’s revolutionary work.
Beginning with concert footage of Bowie’s 1973 show at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in which the glam rocker, through his stage alter ego Ziggy Stardust, announced his retirement from the musical world to a devastated crowd, The Sacred Triangle moves back in time to recount Bowie, Iggy and Reed’s story through interviews from various sources, including Bowie’s ex-wife, Angie Bowie.
Acting as both Bowie’s wife and biggest fan during his frustrating early years as a musician, Bowie notes that her ex was so desperate to be a star that he would play shows solo when he could not put a band together.
Bowie’s artistic reinvention occurred while he was in the audience of Andy Warhol’s controversial play Pork, a show that interviewee Dave Thompson described as “a bunch of New York freaks running around naked, [defecating] on one another.”
The documentary trumpets Warhol’s influence in the eventual collaboration of the three musicians. Warhol’s Factory assistant, Billy Name, gave a behind-the-scenes description of Warhol’s decision to catapult Reed’s band, The Velvet Underground, into stardom by first featuring the group in his multimedia show “Exploding Plastic Inevitable” and eventually producing its first studio album.
On another front, Iggy Pop — depicted through images, old concert footage and firsthand accounts as a wildly out-of-control rockstar — nearly lost his music career to drugs. One interviewee recalled a certain episode during the production of Iggy Pop and The Stooges’ second album in which the star was dropping acid every day.
After The Stooges’ breakup, it was Bowie who took the troubled Iggy under his wing, taking lessons from the drug-addled rocker’s deeply charismatic appeal while also marketing Iggy as a world-class musician who deserved a second chance.
Sure, The Sacred Triangle boasts compelling history and fascinating stories, but the end result is a surprisingly tired and disappointing documentary. It seems almost antithetical that a film about colorful rock stars that sang about sex, drugs and space was constructed in such a formulaic, repetitive manner.
Tales of Iggy’s drug abuse problems, Bowie’s obsession with fame and Reed’s collaboration with Warhol can only keep the audience’s attention for so long. Moreover, viewers are teased with extremely brief song snippets and concert footage scattered throughout but never get the satisfaction of seeing extended clips of the stars in action.
The documentary’s worst crime, however, is that though it boasts the iconic names Bowie, Iggy and Lou, their presence and input in the film is sorely lacking. Bowie’s ex-wife’s comments on the rock star’s revelation of his bisexuality as simply a marketing tool, yet the viewer is left wondering about the rocker’s thoughts and his reasons for fusing his bisexuality with a measure of androgyny to create Ziggy Stardust and the music that followed.
Geared primarily to music academics and hardcore fans, The Sacred Triangle will no doubt educate its audience on a period of drastic change in the music world. Yet, viewers who stumble upon the documentary because of their intrigue toward the three mythical rock figures will leave dissatisfied.
The academic approach to the topic is admirable, however, a much more unconventional approach is necessary to tackle such a strange and remarkable story.

Attend class, study, eat, sleep and go to the occasional (or more often than that) party or two — all activities that define the typical college students. Sometimes, however, we get so caught up with our academic and social obligations that staying fit becomes the last thing on our minds.
Last fall, the National College Health Assessment compiled by the American College Health Association revealed that more than half of college students do not meet the recommendations for “moderate or vigorous exercise.” To elaborate, The American College of Sports Medicine and American Heart Association says these recommendations include “cardio or aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes on five or more days a week, or vigorous [exercise] for at least 20 minutes on three or more days of the week.”
Students who do not exercise at these standards put themselves at higher risk for chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or Type 2 diabetes.

Without the physical education requirements or relative ease of joining high school sports, college students often find themselves putting workouts at the bottom of their priority lists. But many programs and events are striving to help students stay fit, including a commendable initiative that USC takes part in annually.
The recent Pac-10 Fitness Challenge invited USC students and faculty to log their hours working out in a friendly competition against the other universities in the league. A total of 17,450 people participated across the conference, with Arizona State University taking first place.
A major motivation for students to join in on the activities in the Pac-10 challenge was competing against crosstown rival UCLA. Much of the student competition can only play out this rivalry by cheering in the stands — we scream, chant, sing and throw up the sign of victory, but in the end, there isn’t much we can really do to change what is happening. But this amateur-yet-fun way of competing gave students an opportunity for role reversal — students could now be the athletes. They could now see their results being counted in the totals.
But competing against UCLA isn’t the only method of becoming fit, remaining healthy and relieving stress: Intramural competitions between student housing complexes and teams from different student organizations and schools promote friendly contests and increase school spirit.
Playing sports and exercising doesn’t need to be time-consuming or in organized teams either. For those who complain that an hour of exercise takes away from their time studying (I mean, Facebook), alternative ways to approaching exercising gives them no excuse to shy away.
There are no lack of resources available to students at USC to increase physical fitness — but not enough students avail themselves of the chance to drastically improve their health.
Instead of the usual lunch at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, friends can meet in McCarthy Quad for a game of Frisbee or flag football. Rather than picking up the phone to gossip about the weekend’s events, students can walk side-by-side on a treadmill or take a stroll along Trousdale Parkway. And instead of riding a bicycle as far as you can before a Department of Public Safety officer catches you and enforces the bike ban along Trousdale, you can consider walking between classes.
Exercising can be a recreational activity that is enjoyable and convenient — well worth the energy spent if it helps ensure health in the present and future.
So the next time your favorite TV show is on and you’re tempted to plop down on the couch with a bowl of chips and salsa, consider killing two birds with one stone — walk to the Lyon Center or nearest fitness center and plug in your earphones.
Alice Wen is a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism.
John: You hit the nail on the head. The machines and facilities at the Lyon Center are in bad shape, and I can’t remember the last time I saw a working rowing machine (2008?) It’s probably more cost-effective and less aggravating to do laps round the track field than try to put together a decent workout at Lyon.
The number one reason that students at USC do not exercise: inadequate facilities.  While I commend that athletic department for finally taking concrete steps to provide state-of-the-art facilities for our athletic programs, most notably football, the sad truth of the matter is that administrators do not care about adequate exercise facilities for the student body as a whole.  USC has a crumbling excuse for a gym called the Lyon Center.  This building serves more students, yet is at the bottom of USC’s to-do list.  Students have been clamoring for an upgrade to the Lyon Center since I was a freshman and I’m sure dozens of classes before and since mine did the same.
If USC cared about the physical health of students, it would provide a better facility for us to use.

Adult Swim’s Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, the pair behind the sketch show Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, brought its bizarre brand of oddball comedy to Club Nokia on Saturday night. Titled “Tim and Eric Awesome Tour Great Job! Chrimbus Special,” the show featured live music, sketches, videos and appearances by some of the show’s strange stars.
Off-kilter comedian Neil Hamburger opened the evening with his dark, confrontational humor. Jokes about dead celebrities and numerous other insensitive quips had the crowd somewhat ashamedly laughing along.
“You guys keep this up when Tim and Eric come out they’ll put a bullet in your head,” Hamburger said in response to some jokes that spurred small talk from the crowd.
The chatter stopped as soon as the lights went down and Heidecker and Wareheim’s introduction video, featuring the show’s regular David Liebe Hart, came on the screen. The video included the instructions “If you have to go to the bathroom during the show, go in your pants” and “There’s going to be a lot of farts in this show.”
It’s this type of shamelessly low-brow and incredibly odd humor that defines Heidecker and Wareheim. The laughs from the tightly packed crowd were not surprising, considering the duo’s popularity on the often offbeat Adult Swim portion of Cartoon Network.
The duo walked on stage wearing sparkly blue and yellow suits and sang, “What am I gonna get?,” a song explaining “Chrimbus,” the made-up holiday that basically mirrors Christmas.
Throughout the next 10 minutes, Heidecker and Wareheim tossed bags of dried shrimp into the audience as “Chrimbus presents,” discussed the holiday’s traditions and chased each other around while Wareheim wore a costume that made him appear naked. Afterward, they thanked the crowd for coming and walked off the stage. The lights came on and the house music turned up, but the crowd wasn’t fooled by the apparent “end” of the show.
Heidecker and Wareheim were absent from the stage for a bit, as videos similar to those shown on their show projected on a large screen behind the stage. Some of the videos were made specifically for the live show, while others were simply popular sketches from the television program.
The truly disappointing thing about the videos was that comedians such as John C. Reilly and Zach Galifianakis were simply onscreen and not onstage. In Los Angeles, appearances by those comedians or any of the show’s numerous celebrity collaborators  would have not only been feasible, but would have added much to the evening.
After a long series of videos, Heidecker and Wareheim returned to the stage to perform the song “Whatup Brah” as Jim and Derrick, their rapper alter egos. This led to a series of short skits involving these characters, one of which involved bringing two heavy-set male audience members on stage for a wet T-shirt contest — which consisted of Jim and Derrick spraying shaving cream into the unaware audience members’ faces out of beer bongs.
The screen soon showed a faux-preview for Blues Brothers 2012, humorously sponsored by the company Terminix. Heidecker and Wareheim returned to the stage dressed in the Blues Brothers’ signature suits, hats and black Ray-Ban glasses. They performed a series of surreal and random songs, promoted Terminix and sprayed what they claimed to be pesticide — actually water — on themselves and the crowd.
After the Blues Brothers sketch and an excessively long intermission, Heidecker and Wareheim returned with guitars, percussion instruments and an explicitly titled backing band. They preformed joke classic rock songs for the remainder of the show.
Heidecker and Wareheim were actually played their instruments and sang well and the band was surprisingly good. After a while, however, the whole musical gimmick started feeling less like a comedy sketch and more like a concert for a band that nobody really came to see. The jokes were still there, but the novelty had worn off.
The momentum picked back up as Hart joined the band for “a song [he] wrote about L.A. public transportation” in which he sang about the history of Pacific Electric. After an encore of his popular song “Salame,” Heidecker and Wareheim thanked the crowd and walked offstage.
Hart, however, remained to sing a few of his songs that the crowd had loudly requested. During his a capella version of the strange “I’m in Love with an Insect Woman (From Another World),” the club cut off his mic and turned the house lights on, providing a weird and confusing end to an incredibly abnormal but definitely hilarious show.
It was sudden and abrupt, but how else to end a show this strange?

It’s that time of the semester again. Freshmen who haven’t risen before noon since Parents Weekend are pulling themselves out of bed at ungodly hours to reserve a spot in Writing 140. Seniors, whose providence it is to take courses such as Deepwater Cruising (NAUT 001ax) and Ballroom Dancing (THTR 188a), are reading up on the electives most likely to guarantee a multiple choice final exam and planning a five-day weekend.
As students are feverishly clicking “commit changes” in the upcoming weeks, however, they will be doing so on a system that is sorely outdated — an “On-Line Registration Form” that was most likely updated the last time “on-line” was the preferred spelling.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Troja
Though other school programs are keeping up with the times, Web Registration is stagnate. The school has already looked toward making improvements to its advisory programs; last April, the Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution to provide interdisciplinary advisers for students double majoring in different schools. Since 2007, advisers have also been using a comprehensive database that contains students’ academic information. SCampus’s website recently underwent a redesign that includes a system where registered students can post comments as well as a search bar.
Though many parts of the registration system have been updated to accommodate a burgeoning student population, USC’s web registration system is still in need of a major upgrade. (Compared to the improved SCampus, for instance, WebReg looks like an old version of MySpace.)
The WebReg interface would benefit greatly from some of SCampus’ additions — especially a comment section.
There has been a lot of student bluster about the lack of a cohesive course guide. Students can access USG’s guide or the university’s course evaluation website, but the former is in its nascent stages and isn’t comprehensive enough yet, while the latter doesn’t have a forum for student feedback.
By including a comment section in the web registration system, students would be able to provide feedback in a place where it would be most helpful — outgoing seniors could, for example, warn others against the ballroom dancing class with an overly athletic final exam. This function would cover the gap left by the less-than-cohesive course guides.
The site would also benefit from a general streamlining of its organization; such a process might clear up clerical mysteries — for example, why linguistics falls under the “Hindi” category, or why French and Italian are grouped together.
A reorganization might negate the necessity of a search bar, but that would also be a welcome addition for hasty procrastinators who don’t have time to look through the many subsections for that elusive elective.
Many college registration sites also offer professors’ e-mails next to courses so that students can send harried messages seeking spots in classes.
Though some changes would be merely cosmetic and an overall rehaul isn’t needed, the system lacks clarity and user friendliness. Implementing a few minor additions and tweaks could pay big dividends for students, and the changes are a long time coming.
It’s time for USC to push the development of its lagging web components, and make registration a little bit less of a headache.

Pizza might just be the ultimate symbol of comfort and familiarity. For the average American, it draws on fond memories of sleepovers, movie nights and the Super Bowl, plus not-so-fond memories of late-night study crams and generous babysitters.
Pizza plays a significant part in the American culture; it’s something people count as a constant they can turn to, something they crave when they feel nostalgic or ransacked by their fast-paced lifestyles. At the end of a crazy day, some people just want to snuggle on the couch with a box of good old pepperoni pizza and The Office re-runs.
But in other cultures, pizza can mean very different things. Although pizza in the United States is generally ranked near the bottom of the food chain along with fries and burgers, Naples (considered to be the birth place of modern pizza) is so proud of its pizza that it badgered the European Union to grant Neopolitan pizza a special label to protect its traditional qualities — and won.
Taste of Oaxaca · Pal Cabron’s menu features clayudas, a cheesy, pizza-like mix of mole sauce and pork on a thin and cripsy tortilla. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
In certain parts of the Middle East, Manakeesh, an Arabian dish similar to pizza, is typically served as breakfast or a light lunch. On the other hand, in many Asian countries, pizza is a pricey, sit-down affair, and Pizza Hut is ranked considerably higher up in the restaurant hierarchy than it is in the United States.
And in France, where pizza is considered an individual meal at most respectable restaurants, sharing is frowned upon.
In truth, pizza is really an ambiguous term. The way it is cooked, the manner it is eaten and what it represents are different on each continent.
Japanese pizza takes that metaphor quite enthusiastically. Japan is known for its demure and modest culture, but not when it comes to pizza. Like a repressed child, it erupts in all sorts of fantastical pizza creations. For a taste of Japanese kitsch in Los Angeles, stop by Strawberry Cones at Downtown’s Little Tokyo Shopping Center.
Smack in the middle of the bare shopping center you’ll see the small pizza stand, underwhelming in its appearance but overwhelming in its pizza selections. For the full otherworldly experience, get your pizza on a ninja crust; as its cheesy name implies, the crust is mysteriously dark grey like charcoal — because it is charcoal, specifically bamboo charcoal, called chikutan in Japanese and something that is  supposedly rich in minerals and good for the body.
Whatever you might believe about eating charcoal, it is perfectly edible and delicious — if you just forget that it’s made with ash. The crust is also made with rice flour to give it a smooth, crispy exterior but a chewier texture inside.
The crust is not the only wacky component of the pizza. Mayonnaise? Avocado? Fish roe? Roasted seaweed? Edamame? Corn? Basically, anything you would find in sushi can be found on Strawberry Cone’s pizza. There is even have a dessert pizza — the California Walnut and Raisin, which comes with Gorgonzola sauce and powdered sugar dusted on top.
Strawberry Cones is really one of those places you have to try for yourself to determine if you love it, or hate it.
If you don’t like the feeling of being weighed down by heavy carbohydrates, consider Pal Cabron, which recently opened its second branch in Koreatown. Pal Cabron is by no means a haven for dieters — quite the contrary, it delights in the excess, but its clayudas, a traditional Oaxacan snack, are surprisingly light.
Clayuda is really spelled Tlayuda, but spelling is of minor interest when it comes to taste. One order is huge — but it’s actually not as big a portion as it looks, and the flavors are so bold and wonderful that it is no problem finishing the whole thing by yourself.
A clayuda looks very much like a pizza, but it tastes nothing like one. The tortilla crust it comes in is shatteringly thin, just barely holding up the loads of toppings. The toppings are minimal and not nearly as complicated as those at Strawberry Cones: thin slabs of cecina enchilada (spiced pork) or a dark mole sauce, which are simple yet loud enough in flavor. All the clayudas come weighed down with oodles of creamy, chewy hand-stripped quesillo, the popular Oaxacan string-style cheese.
If even that is too extraordinary for you, khachapuri is a tamer ethnic pizza to test your gastronomical curiosity. Khachapuri is a rich, doughy staple dish from the Republic of Georgia. It has a boat-like crust filled with cracked eggs, very much like egg-in-a-hole, except calorified with oozing butter and cheese.
Traditional khachapuri is stuffed with sulguni, a cooked stringy cheese that is impossible to procure in the United States, but the Southern Californian pizza chain, Big Mama’s & Papa’s Pizzeria, serves a decent one with mozzarella and feta cheese instead.
As expected of a bread vessel, the crust is thick and crusty but soaked in the juices and fat of egg yolks, cheese and butter. The crust becomes a deliciously primal utensil to scoop up the stuffing.
You can also get it topped with ham and bacon or pastrami if you’re feeling carnivorous or vegetables if you need some nutritional justification for this carb feast. Big Mama’s & Papa’s Pizzeria offers online ordering and delivery as well, so you can also indulge in your usual pizza nights.
Whatever pizza might mean to you, it is still fun to venture out of the norm and enter another culture’s familiar territory. Pizza might mirror laziness or low-caliber eats to some, but it actually is a cultural and gastronomical activity, unique to each country.

Wow! I love hearing about all these different kinds of pizza. It reminds me of all the creative pizzas from your Tour de Asia. Hope all is going well for you out West.

Dean Yannis Yortsos has signed on to serve a second five-year term in his position as the head of the Viterbi School of Engineering.
Yortsos was appointed dean in 2005 by former university President Steven B. Sample. He had previously served a year as interim dean after his predecessor, current USC President C.L. Max Nikias, vacated the post to become the university’s provost.
The vetting process for Yortsos’ reappointment included a faculty survey, reviews by the USC Board of Councilors and consultations with school constituencies.

Yortsos also submitted a 14-page memorandum of his accomplishments in the past five years as dean.
“I can’t say which is my greatest accomplishment,” Yortsos said. “My job is to create a culture and environment where people feel they are immersed in exciting research, scholarship, inspiration and discovery.”
Under his leadership, Viterbi has risen from No. 11 to No. 10 in the top 100 engineering schools worldwide in rankings determined by the annually published Academic Ranking of World Universities.
“My aspiration at this school is that every faculty member feels that they are the very best at what they do at this school,” Yortsos said. “My job is to help them do that.”
Professor Erik Johnson, an associate chair of the Sonny Astani Department, said Yortsos played a crucial part in expanding Viterbi’s role in the international engineering community.
“He’s helped expand our visibility by taking leadership of the Grand Challenges National Summit,” Johnson said.
Yortsos was a founder and chair of the summit when it was held at Duke University last year. The summit was held at USC at the beginning of October, and brought engineering’s greatest minds to Viterbi.
Yortsos also helped create the Office of Strategic Initiatives, which helped increase Viterbi’s global presence.
Efforts to expand Viterbi’s role in the global engineering community have also been a  substantial focus of Yortsos’. He spent the past few weeks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Taipei, meeting with parents of current and future students in “Parents’ Day” receptions.
He was also promoting i-Podium, a program that allows engineering students from Beijing to interact with their USC counterparts via video conference.
Johnson said Yortsos’ dedication to the Viterbi faculty might be what made him the perfect pick for a second term. Yortsos has been part of Viterbi since 1979.
“He’s had very good relations with faculty, especially junior faculty,” Johnson said. “He’s been a part of the faculty for many years and he recognizes that the university wouldn’t be here without them.”
Stephanie Stillman, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, said she appreciates the high quality of Viterbi faculty and resources.
“Viterbi is really involved in their students and they really want us to succeed,” Stillman said. “They know how tough engineering can be and they give us access to the resources we need to be stand-outs.”

When it comes to country music, it isn’t hard to picture cliché songs about the South. A new country band, The Band Perry, has soulfully subverted that stereotype with passionate, universally-appealing lyrics and songs. And that’s what it brought to Los Angeles on Friday.
Interestingly enough, the three band members not only share a love of country music, but also a last name, hence “The Band Perry.” The band consists of Kimberly Perry (vocals), Reid Perry (bass) and Neil Perry (mandolin, drums and accordion).
“[The three of us] are brothers and sister,” Kimberly Perry said. “We are not married and Reid isn’t our son.”

Although the group only has one album out, its hit singles such as “Hip to My Heart,” and “If I Die Young,” have led The Band Perry to early recognition with several nominations from both the Country Music Awards and the American Country Awards.
Friday night, The Band Perry heated up the stage at the Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live. The Band Perry, along with fellow country singer Chris Young, served as the opening acts for the legendary country singer Alan Jackson.
Although the concert was a chance for the band to shine, the siblings did not consider it to be about them.
“We [planned] to play a little and learn a lot on the A.J. tour and it’s just an honor to warm up the stage for him,” Kimberly Perry said.
The spacious stage was set up minimally, with only two simple screens in the background that projected golden fields of grain. The sparse set allowed the band to focus on the music, captivating the audience without bells and whistles, using just pure adrenalin and unforgettable melodies.
Before a crowd of country music lovers — ranging from children to grandparents — decked out in cowboy boots and hats, The Band Perry opened with “You Lie,” a song about a broken relationship.
The audience cheered as Kimberly Perry hit the high notes with heady strength and precision. The opening, “You Lie,” featured some powerful wordplay, such as, I never like the taste of crow / But baby I ate it.
Leading right into the next song “Hip to my Heart,” the band began with a fun riff between the fiddle and electric guitar. In the middle of the song Kimberly Perry improvised some different lyrics for the song, singing, “Los Angeles — you play it cool,” to the loud agreement of the crowd.
With influences coming anywhere from Loretta Lynn and Aretha Franklin to bluegrass and the Beatles, The Band Perry songs were a catchy and creative blend of country and rock, a sound that the members attribute to their parents.
“Daddy put us to bed with the Rolling Stones and Mamma woke us up with Loretta Lynn,” Kimberly Perry said.
This blend combined with Kimberly Perry’s strong and sassy vocals and the smooth and twangy harmonizing voices of Reid Perry and Neil Perry helped the band’s audience.
Next, The Bandy Perry played “Miss You Being Gone,” opening with an impressive rock ‘n’ roll guitar riff followed by lyrics full of sass and wit aimed at a returning ex-boyfriend.
A short introduction of the band members led into Reid Perry’s self-admitted favorite song on the album, “Independence.”
“[Independence] is about stretching out on your own for the first time and finding your feet in this world,” Reid Perry said.
In the middle of the song, the band transitioned into a cover of Tom Petty’s hit song “Free Fallin’.”
Although many critics of country music can disparage the genre as only being full of clichéd lyrics about Chevy trucks breaking down or singers’ dogs dying, The Band Perry uniquely supplements its songs with a love for literature.
“We are avid readers and one of our favorite literary genres is Southern Gothic. We love Flannery O’Connor,” said Kimberly Perry.
This influence could be seen thematically in the next song, “If I Die Young.”
“This song is about making the most of what you’ve been given,” Kimberly Perry said. As a hush fell over the audience, someone audibly said “I love this song,” as he or she intently listened to the poignant and touching lullaby-like ballad.
The last song of the set, “Quittin’ You,” brought a fun and playful end to the band’s show as Kimberly Perry dedicated it to the city, saying “Oh Los Angeles, it’s over.”
Although The Band Perry was only able to play six songs, it made a lasting and memorable impression. After the concert, a large number of people lined up for autographs and photos with the band.
The tour with Alan Jackson is just the start of the band’s ascent. The siblings will serve as presenters at  Wednesday night’s Country Music Awards. The Band Perry is also in the running for a prize itself, having been nominated for Vocal Group of the Year, along with Lady Antebellum, Rascal Flatts and several other artists.
“To be there will be just an honor in itself,” Neil Perry said.
Although The Band Perry might not be expecting any awards, its performance on Friday and new album prove it is bursting with new talent and are here to stay.
Great review. Sounds like it was a terrific show. These guys are going places

The cinephiles have been pouring out in droves for many mouthwatering offerings at the American Film Institute’s 2010 festival. Although the presence of Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway at Thursday night’s opening screening of Love and Other Drugs has drawn the largest crowd thus far, the most whispered title here is currently Blue Valentine.
Derek Cianfrance’s new film, which follows the blissful courtship and later disintegration of a tragically enamored Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, drew rapturous applause from a stunned audience that packed its Saturday night premiere at Grauman’s Chinese Theater.
Not only is AFI Fest admirable in its lineup, it’s completely free as well. Screenings like Blue Valentine and The King’s Speech have boasted an A-list crowd, from Cindy Crawford to Judd Apatow, but also a healthy amount of the non-movie stars. The recently employed a rush line policy, allowing those without online tickets to line up for extra seats (released 15 minutes before each screening). This has proved a reliable means of admittance, with AFI staff working to accommodate as many hopefuls as possible. Early arrival is a must — one to two hours before a screening is recommended — but the likely reward is something very worth it.
The festival concludes on Thursday night with a screening of Darren Aronofsky’s highly anticipated ballet shocker Black Swan.

Youth did not play a huge role in this year’s nationwide midterm elections compared to previous years, only accounting for 9 percent of voters, according to CBS News and The Huffington Post.
Only half of the youth voters who voted in 2008 — 18 percent — also voted in this year’s midterm election, CBS reports.
Additionally, the 58 percent of youth who did vote only voted for Democratic candidates, according to The Huffington Post.
However, it seems that the low turnout was anticipated, since Rock the Vote reported to The Huffington Post that only half the students they polled said they would even vote in the midterm elections.

The Trojans finally saw a late field goal go their way.
Two in fact. USC kicker Joe Houston kicked the game-winning 29-yard field goal a few minutes before Arizona State’s Thomas Weber hooked a 42-yarder, ensuring a 34-33 USC win and ending the Trojans’ penchant for letting games slip through their grasp.
Coming into the game, the Trojans had lost three of their last four, including two heart-breaking losses on late field goals against Washington and Stanford and a deflating beat-down by Oregon last week.
Steady hand - Quarterback Matt Barkley completed 26 of 37 pass attempts for 215 yards, finishing with three touchdowns and two interceptions against the Sun Devils. It was the fifth time this season that the sophomore signal caller passed for three or more touchdowns this season. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
“I really kind of felt like finally,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We just hadn’t had many breaks go our way throughout the year…It was really good for our players just to see them have something go their way.”
Houston especially was thankful for the redemption. The senior kicker missed two first-quarter kicks of 27 and 29 yards, but came through with USC trailing 33-31 and just over three minutes remaining on the clock.
“I’m human, I was anxious,” Houston said. “But I believe in myself, I believe in my teammates and my team put me in a position to let me do my job.”
Houston, who is six for 12 on field goals tries this year, said the kick was for his teammates.
“I believe in Joe, I’ve believed in him this whole year,” USC sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said.
A lot of pieces had to fall in place in the buildup to Houston’s game-winning kick. A tame first half turned into a wacky second, defined by huge plays on special teams and defensive touchdowns.
Three point-after-touchdown plays tipped the balance in the Trojans’ favor.
After USC linebacker Malcolm Smith returned an interception 66 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter, the Trojans converted a two-point conversion on a pass from Mitch Mustain to David Ausberry.
Next, the Sun Devils lined up to go for two after a interception return for a touchdown by cornerback Omar Bolden, hoping to tie the Trojans at 29. But USC’s pass rush sacked Sun Devil quarterback Steven Threet.
Then, after Arizona State scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 9-yard pass from Threet to Jamal Miles, offensive tackle Tyron Smith blocked the point-after try and cornerback Torin Harris caught the ball on a hop and sprinted for the opposite endzone.
Harris dove in for the two-point score, drawing a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct, but the play stood. Instead of going up 34-29, The Sun Devils’ lead was cut to 33-31 and the momentum was back on the Trojans’ sideline.
Senior cornerback Shareece Wright said Harris shouldn’t have dove unnecessarily, but he couldn’t be too mad at his teammate.
“I mean I can’t blame him, I don’t know what I would have done in that situation,” Wright said.
These were just a few of the key special teams plays filling up a game that had many, which included two blocked punts (one partially) by USC safety T.J. McDonald and a 100-yard kickoff return by Arizona State’s LeQuan Lewis.
Special teams turned out to be the crucial for a Trojan team that has put more focus on that aspect of the game under special teams coach John Baxter.
“It’s a third of the game,” Houston said. “In games like this, you really see that special teams execution is critical.”
On the game’s first drive, the Sun Devils caught the Trojans off guard when Threet tossed a lateral to Miles. Miles launched the ball to a wide-open T.J. Simpson for a 54-yard gain.
Threet found Gerell Robinson for a 10-yard touchdown in the endzone to cap the 72-yard drive.
The Trojans’ defense stiffened up after that, though, holding Arizona State scoreless the rest of the first half. The Trojans held Threet, who leads the Pac-10 with 268 passing yards per game, to 228 yards and intercepted him twice. Threet threw three touchdowns.
After Houston’s early struggles, Kiffin kept the offense on the field on a fourth down play in the second quarter, which resulted in a 15-yard Marc Tyler touchdown on a swing pass from Barkley that tied the score at 7.
Barkley, along with the rest of the USC offense, had an up-and-down game, finishing 26-of-37 for 215 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions.
Barkley missed a streaking Robert Woods for what looked to be a sure touchdown on his first pass of the game. Kiffin said that might have thrown his quarterback off.
“I’m sure it took him a while to get over the first play,” Kiffin said. “It took me a while to get over it.”
Tyler, who left the game in the fourth quarter with an ankle sprain, led the Trojans on the ground with 120 yards on 12 carries.
After a late night at the Coliseum, the Trojans were just happy to find themselves on the winning side of a late-game field goal.
“We know what it feels like to be on the other side of the ball now,” Wright said.
Added Kiffin: “All in all, after what we’ve gone through in the last four games prior to this — you know the two last-second losses and the Oregon game— we’re just happy to get a win right now.”
