Eight days after beginning official practices, the USC men’s basketball team competed in the annual Cardinal & Gold scrimmage on Saturday.

Following a two-hour practice, the Trojans split into two teams, with the Cardinal team coached by assistant coach Dieter Horton and the Gold team led by assistant coach Tony Miller. The teams played four four-minute quarters, with the Cardinal team winning 39-29.
“Any win is a good win, even if it is just between us,” junior forward Nikola Vucevic said. “I think we played pretty well. We executed our plays, but we need to do a better job on defense.”
Vucevic led the Cardinal team with 13 points and a game-high eight rebounds. Senior guard Donte Smith had a game-high 20 points for the Gold team.
“Last year, this game was a debacle. I remember leaving here thinking, ‘I am going straight to a bar because this is not going to be any fun this year,’” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “These guys did a much better job executing. We have guys that know the system from last year, which makes it easier. We also have guys with great natural instincts.”
The Trojans are counting on their four freshmen to contribute immediately. Freshman guard Maurice Jones scored the first basket of the scrimmage, and fellow freshman guard Bryce Jones had a breakaway dunk on the next possession to give the Cardinal team a quick 4-0 lead. Maurice Jones finished with six points and three assists, and Bryce Jones had five points and one assist. Freshman forward Curtis Washington had two points for the Gold team in only two minutes. Freshman forward Garrett Jackson was sidelined with a broken nose.
The scrimmage also gave fans an opportunity to see two new transfers. Junior forward Aaron Fuller, who cannot play until the 2011-2012 season after transferring from Iowa, had six points. Junior guard Jio Fontan, who will be eligible to play Dec. 18 against Kansas after transferring from Fordham, did not play in the scrimmage because of bruised ribs, although he participated in the practice beforehand.
The scrimmage helped show O’Neill what his team needs to work on before it opens the regular season against UC Irvine on Nov. 13.
“We need to really tighten it up defensively. We know what we are doing, but we are about a step off everything,” O’Neill said. “We also need to become a much, much better executing team off set plays.”
The Trojans will play next in an exhibition game against Point Loma Nazarene at the Galen Center on    Nov. 6 at 2 p.m.

This has been a rough year for USC football.
Sure, the Trojans are 5-2 and just decimated a Cal team that, until two weeks ago, looked like decent competition in the Pac-10.
But don’t be fooled. The temporary happiness that USC is currently experiencing only masks the lingering damage that it withstood to get to this point, which could aptly be considered the college football equivalent of 2012, slightly bearable. From the gut-wrenching departure of Pete Carroll to the dream-crushing NCAA sanctions to two consecutive last-second game-winning field goals, this season has been a firestorm of disaster.
In fact, for all of the adversity that the team had to deal with, the only thing that wasn’t thrown the Trojans’ way was a break.
But for those of you waiting on pins and needles for this period of relief to come, you can now get out your calligraphy pens and flowered stationery because the NCAA scheduling committee deserves a thank-you card.
The placement of USC’s bye week, directly after the Cal game and directly before its colossal clash with powerhouse Oregon, should be thought of as nothing less than a blessing from the football gods. The chance for the Trojans to recuperate  might be the most important thing that happens to USC this entire season.
The current injury list from Thursday’s practice reads as such: Redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton, senior linebacker Malcolm Smith, senior offensive guard Butch Lewis, freshman Dillon Baxter, senior tailback C.J. Gable, senior center Kris O’Dowd, senior tailback Allen Bradford and junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith did not practice, and redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry, redshirt sophomore offensive guard Khaled Holmes, redshirt freshman offensive guard John Martinez, senior tight end Jordan Cameron, redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler and redshirt freshman defensive end James Boyd, all of whom were limited in practice.
Hypothetically, if the Trojans played Saturday instead of having a bye week, they would be without 10 players that have started at some point this season.
But because those players can nurse their ailments while back-ups get much-needed practice time with the first-team squads, the Trojans have the chance to go from being decimated by injury last week to fully prepared this week, all because they don’t have to suit up on Saturday.
And with a game against No. 1 Oregon — in which the Trojans will need to do everything right if they want to come out victorious — fast approaching, this downtime might be the slight difference between felling the Pac-10 giant and falling to 2-3 in the conference.
All season, the Trojans have tried to make the most of their situation, coping with a new system and a miniscule depth chart. They didn’t tackle in practice for almost the entire summer and fall camp, and players have been moved around constantly to try to combat injuries.
Sometimes, it has worked — the Trojans started 4-0 and looked very much like USC teams of old as they handily beat Cal two Saturdays ago.
But at other times, the team’s lack of depth shone through even the Trojans’ most desperate attempts, making it glaringly apparent that not even a lead late in the fourth quarter could mean sure victory for USC.
If last game was any indication, the young, inexperienced Trojan team that entered the season has matured — in the span of only seven games — into a cohesive unit on both sides of the ball, but injuries continue to weigh it down. With the bye week, USC now has the opportunity to heal and reset as if the season were going to start anew Saturday, but with one difference — the knowledge and experience acquired by each player, learned only by being dragged through the highest of highs and lowest of lows.
Considering all of the challenges USC has faced so far, facing Oregon on Saturday suddenly doesn’t seem so bad.

With five seconds left in the match, junior goalie Joel Dennerley lunged to his left to bat away a 5-meter penalty shot from No. 6 UC Santa Barbara’s (10-6) Milos Golic — last season’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation scoring leader and already the scorer of three goals in the game.
Although the save was irrelevant to the final outcome, a game the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (16-2) won 13-9, Dennerley’s ability to bear down and focus in that moment served as a microcosm of the young Trojan’s effort on Sunday afternoon.
Facing the prospect of losing three straight games after the program had not lost consecutive games since 2007, the team needed to refocus and start off well. USC coach Jovan Vavic expressed confidence that the impending playoffs would help re-energize a team that might be tiring from the perfunctory, grueling daily workouts.
“This game was huge for us. We needed to get back on track,” junior driver Peter Kurzeka said. “We knew they were a good offensive team going in and we still gave up a lot of goals, but a win is a win.”
Despite the team yielding nine goals, Vavic was not overly concerned about the defense. He planned for his team to review some videotape of the game, but he could not pinpoint any specific areas on which it needed to improve. Several Santa Barbara sharp-shooters, including Golic, netted difficult shots from long distances against which Dennerley — who recorded nine saves — had little chance.
Vavic quickly shifted the discussion to his prolific offense, particularly freshmen driver Nikola Vavic and two-meter Jeremy Davie, who scored a hat-trick against Santa Barbara. Earlier in the week, he noted that these two players, who have emerged as focal points of the offense, made mistakes against California and Stanford that they were not making at the start of the season.
“Offensively, I think we were outstanding. We scored 13 goals and most of the players shot the ball well,” Vavic said. “Davie did a great job not only in scoring but also in drawing ejections. Peter Kurzeka finally scored some goals. Nikola did a good job in drawing some ejections and made some nice assists. Overall, I think our offense was much more focused than it was against Berkeley.”
Undoubtedly, the diverse scoring attack in this game — nine different players scored at least one goal, including Kurzeka and sophomore utility Mace Rapsey, who both scored two goals each — was reminiscent of the games before Stanford and California.
During those two games, the only losses for USC this year, the Trojans became too reliant on Nikola Vavic and Davie’s scoring prowess. Jovan Vavic knows that for the Trojans to continue their otherworldly scoring pace and to lessen the pressure on Dennerley they need Kurzeka and other returners to score as they were at the beginning of the season.
Next on the docket for the Trojans are back-to-back home games against Pacific and Concordia on Saturday. The Trojans most likely will look to utilize most of their depth in order to rest their regulars as they prepare for a crucial home matchup against UCLA in two weeks.

A record-breaking crowd turned out to watch USC defeat UCLA in women’s soccer Friday night at the Coliseum.
Moving past · Sophomore forward Samantha Johnson and the Women of Troy beat UCLA for just the fourth time in school history and the first time during the regular season since 1998. USC put itself in good position to make the playoffs with the win. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The 8,527 fans — 323 more than the previous NCAA record for a women’s soccer regular-season match in 2006 at Texas A&M — were kept on the edge of their seats until they erupted in celebration five minutes before the end of the game.
That’s when freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano scored the most important goal of her young career. In the 86th minute, Altamirano received a long lofted pass from senior defender Karter Haug, let the ball bounce once and volleyed it over the head of UCLA goalkeeper Chante’ Sandiford to give No. 23 USC (9-4-3, 2-2-1) a 1-0 victory and its first regular-season win over No. 19 UCLA (9-6-1,  2-3-0) since 1998.
“I’m speechless. It’s such an unbelievable feeling,” Altamirano said. “It’s probably the best feeling I’ll ever feel in my life — easily the best goal I’ve ever scored.”
The crowd still had to wait five minutes to celebrate just the fourth USC victory over UCLA in history, as the Bruins poured it on after the goal. Finally the whistle sounded after what USC coach Ali Khosroshahin called “the longest five minutes of my life.”
“The ladies really responded this evening,” Khosroshahin said. “They showed the Trojan faithful that if you put us under the lights we’ll go for it. And they really went for it.”
The Women of Troy had been building up the game for a long time, which was advertised as “Break the Record Night.” USC almost broke the attendance record two years ago against the Bruins in the Coliseum but fell just short of 8,000 people with an attendance that ranked second at the time. Friday’s crowd not only broke the record, but gave the Women of Troy an extra boost.
“The crowd was amazing,” Haug said. “They kept our energy up, especially when we were tied going into the last 15 minutes. They were a big part of our game.”
The Spirit of Troy was also there in full force, playing almost continuously throughout the game. And when the band wasn’t playing music, it mimicked a vuvuzela-like sound, creating quite the atmosphere.
“What an unbelievable evening,” Khosroshahin said. “What an awesome crowd. Everything was incredible.”
The late goal was fitting for a game that was heavy in action.
In the 28th minute, senior forward Megan Ohai had a goal waved off for running into the goalkeeper, and suddenly the pace picked up for the Women of Troy. Although lacking in shots on goal, much of the remainder of the half was a clinic in ball possession and steadfast defense by both sides.
The Women of Troy nearly broke through in the 42nd minute as well. Sandiford came out of the goal to clear a ball but ended up playing it right to senior midfielder Alyssa Dávila. Dávila immediately fired on net, but Sandiford managed to recover her position and was able to stop the shot to keep the game scoreless.
The second half featured much more back-and-forth action and a very noticeable increase in scoring chances for each team. In the 48th minute, redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval — who scored the game winning goal two weeks ago against Cal on a free kick from about 20 yards out —  had a free kick from nearly the exact same location but was shut down by Sandiford.
With tension mounting, the game started to get physical. Sandoval picked up a yellow card just two minutes after her free kick, and two more yellow cards were issued to UCLA during the next 25 minutes.
“It got a little dirty out there,” Altamirano said. “They had some dirty plays, but we gave it right back to them. It’s a rivalry game.”
And like every great rivalry, the game was not without controversy. In the 73rd minute, junior defender Claire Schloemer appeared to intentionally pass the ball with her feet to freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church, which by rule is a penalty kick. The referee, however, ruled that Schloemer’s touch was inadvertent, and therefore legal. UCLA coach Jillian Ellis vehemently disagreed and could be seen yelling at the referee for some time afterward.
The back-and-forth play continued for the next 10 minutes until, finally, Altamirano broke through.
In addition to the importance of a rivalry game, the Women of Troy were in dire need of a win after a rough weekend in Oregon where they lost to Oregon State and could only manage a tie against Pac-10 bottom feeder Oregon.
“We needed a result tonight,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s nerve-racking to play in front of a crowd like this, but I thought the ladies handled it well. They really kept their composure.”

As people stood in lines for hours to see President Barack Obama at the “Moving America Forward” rally on Friday, some said they were uphappy and inconvenienced by the event.
Check the box · Students from USC and other schools held up signs encouraging people to vote in the upcoming midterm elections on Nov. 2. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
The rally, which featured Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown, Sen. Barbara Boxer, actor Jamie Foxx and band Ozomatli, brought 32,500 people to Alumni Park and 5,000 people who overflowed into McCarthy Quad.
Logistics, many said, were the main issue.
Volunteers working at the rally said they felt the event was disorganized and they would have appreciated more instruction from volunteer coordinators.
“I understand that it’s really tough to coordinate something that is so huge, [but] there were definitely parts that could have been improved,” said David Luo, a junior majoring in neuroscience who volunteered on Friday.
Luo also said he was one of many volunteers who were unable to control where people stood based on their ticket color — yellow, green or blue. Discrepancies over the tickets and what they signified caused major confusion among attendees Friday.
“The most unfair thing was the ticketing system,” Luo said. “After a while, there were just too many people rushing through and we couldn’t enforce anything.”
From the safety standpoint, officials said the event ran smoothly. The event required the Secret Service, the Department of Public Safety, the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department to work together to ensure safety for the politicians and attendees, said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
“That planning paid off for what ended up being a safe appearance by the president,” Carlisle said. “We didn’t have any major incidents, and I attribute that to all the planning. … It went extraordinarily well.”
Several people at the rally, however, were treated for minor incidents, such as dehydration and fainting, Carlisle said.
“We had multiple medical calls where we would have to respond EMTs. Most all of them were minor in nature,” said Carlisle, who also said these incidents are not surprising at an outdoor event where attendees are required to stand for many hours.
One attendee who drove from San Diego to see Obama said she noticed several people whom paramedics rolled out of the crowd on stretchers.
“There was a large crowd gathered on the balcony behind the pharmacy [on the steps,]” said Margaret Hokkanen, 50, a real estate agent. “After they cleared the balcony, people were taken one by one on stretchers.”
Hokkanen said she saw one person receiving oxygen while on the stretcher,
Students who did not attend the rally also said they felt inconvenienced by the entire event, making it difficult to get to class and walk through campus.
Lyn Stephenson, a first-year graduate student studying writing for screen and television, said she attended class at a nearby coffee shop because of the chaos on campus.
“As a commuter who takes the train, the shuttle unfortunately dropped me off near the growing lines in the morning. As I walked toward my class, I had to deal with crowds, the event organizers and news reporters,” Stephenson wrote in an e-mail.
Stephenson said the shuttles were running late and were crowded with non-USC students, which made her miss her train while trying to leave campus to go home.
“[The rally] should have been held at a different time. Even a few hours later would [have been] much more convenient, as the majority of classes would’ve been over,” Stephenson said. “If Obama is dedicated to our education, he shouldn’t have interrupted it.”
Dear Mr. Obama:
We appreciate your effort in coming to visit our campus and, while we were honored, we were also very upset by your callousness. Ms.Lyn Stephenson had to travel all the way from her 3 bedroom condo in the Marina, all set to attend her Basketweaving 101 class, only to find herself INCONVENIENCED by your presence and the crowds you attracted.  We understand that you are the President of the United States, but what is more important here? You? Or Ms. Stephenson and the sniffling editors of the Daily Trojan?  This poor student was forced to attend a makeshift class in a coffee shop! Did you hear me?I said, in a coffee shop. You might think this trivial, but it is something as terrifying as having to manage two wars and an economy on the precipice.  She might have also been so rattled by the crowds you rallied, Ms. Stephenson might have tripped on her Jimmy Choos, chipped a nail, and scuffed her Vuitton bag.  Please, Mr. Obama, show some respect for the plight of us students. Or have you no shame?
Between this graduate student and the editors of the Daily Trojan in their previous editorial, the conception that an independent reader would form of the school’s student population is one of narcissism, shallowness, and unintelligence. I don’t like Obama; in fact, I despise his politics. But I still understand that he has a job to do. This job may conflict with students’ lives and inconvenience them. But really. Get over yourselves. You miss your train? Take the next one. The shuttle is too crowded? Wait for the next one, or if that is too difficult, take a taxi or a city bus. Sometimes life gets hard. Deal with it.
I am a student and I was not troubled by this event in the least.  USC sent plenty of emails reminding students of the increased traffic and class closures that would be happening due to President Obama’s visit.  While my heart bleeds with sorrow for the plight of the screenwriting grad student, that student should have known exactly what was happening and planned transportation accordingly.  Traffic was going to be bad, so plan on the possibility of getting home a bit later than usual.
Also, this:  “If Obama is dedicated to our education, he shouldn’t have interrupted it.”  That is one of the most ignorant statements I’ve ever heard.  The President did not interrupt anything; the university did not cancel classes and gave ample warning about the increased traffic.  If this grad student was troubled in any way by this event, the burden was on that student to make the day go smoothly, not the President or OFA, who had the full backing and support of USC’s administration to put on this event at exactly the time that they did.

After starting its journey a few years ago as an indie band from Australia, The Temper Trap has been winning over fans from around the world with catchy hooks and exquisite live shows.
Saturday’s show brought the group to Los Angeles and marked the final night of its North American tour.  The intimate size and indoor setting of Club Nokia was perfect for the show because, according to the band’s guitarist Lorenzo Sillitto, it is “harder to rock out in broad daylight,”
The opening acts, The Hundred in the Hands, from New York, and Delphic, from the United Kingdom, were great at setting an overall tone, that lasted through the night. With a mix of techno and indie music, Delphic woke up the audience and soon had it dancing to the band’s unique sound.
There was a constant flow of unique song endings  throughout its set Delphic’s concentration on layering an assortment of sounds and playing around with several time meters made the band’s performance interesting to watch and listen to.
When it was finally The Temper Trap’s turn to perform, it seemed like everyone’s wish came true. As it started off with an intense instrumental, camera phones shot up into the air, lighting up the general admission floor. Watching bassist Jonathon Aherne’s syncopated movements, the audience instantly swayed to the musician’s deep notes.
There was no doubt that lead singer Dougy Mandagi has a captivating voice. It filled the room and floated delicately above the infectious sounds of the guitars, keyboards and the driving quality of the drums. There was an ethereal quality to everything that made listening to each song an escape from reality.
The band members are very innovative and sincere musicians and performers, and their uniqueness has resulted in a significant influx of fans. With its music appearing in multiple television commercials and popular TV shows such as The Hard Times of RJ Berger and One Tree Hill, The Temper Trap are no longer up-and-comers.
Sillitto told the audience that he has gotten in the habit of changing the channel when one of the band’s songs is playing on TV, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t appreciate the band’s increase in popularity.
“I would have to say that it is very pleasing when you talk to people after the show or you see their comments on our website about how they found out about the band through the different sync avenues and its justification that you have made the right decision,” he said.
Although (500) Days of Summer provided the band members with a huge amount of exposure, they have worked extremely hard to reach their current status in the music industry. Before moving to the United Kingdom, each band member managed to hold down a regular job in addition to touring in Australia.
The band’s exposure from television and film proved to guide them into a positive direction.
“I think that the move has made us a better band and a closer unit because we have spent too much time together and have triple the amount of shows,” Sillitto said.
After being nominated for several awards in Australia, winning APRA’s Song of the Year award for “Sweet Disposition,” and an unexpected turnout for their 2010 Coachella set, the band members began to feel like their goals were progressing.
The band’s debut album, Conditions, was created during a period when the band members were still evolving and discovering who they were as a band. They played around with a variety of instruments and were influenced by layered and textured music.”
“Lush was the word that we tended to use a lot when we would describe the sound we were trying to get to,” Sillitto said. “We always hoped that our music, even though it can be dark in some spots, has an underlining feeling of hope about it.”
Because Conditions was such a success, the band came up with Conditions Remixed, set to be released on Nov. 1. The album will be comprised of remixed tracks, including “Science of Fear,” “Love Lost” and “Down River.”
“Most of them have never been released or played in public, so it is pretty exciting for us,” Sillitto said. The band plans on continuing with a tour in Indonesia and the United Kingdom and have been working on its next album. Although the group does not plan on venturing too far from its authentic sound, it is continuing to experiment with different textures to make sure it doesn’t produce a record that sounds exactly like the first.
“We have always wanted to push ourselves and try new approaches,” Sillitto said.

Wiltern attendees were ready for the weekend.
Full on · Minus the Bear pulled off a flawless, energetic show. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
At least, that’s how it seemed during the energetic performance of Minus the Bear on Friday. The band enjoyed a receptive crowd, ready to celebrate the end of a long workweek with music from an audience-appreciative musical group.
“Yeah, it sounds like a Friday night, doesn’t it?” Minus the Bear’s singer/guitarist Jake Snider said to the crowd.
The concert was a chance for the band to show off its new sound. Its previous three albums with Suicide Squeeze Records were a mix of raw energy, quirky-yet-pensive lyrics and unpredictable arrangements. Now with Dangerbird Records, the band has set out to create more soulful and sensual compilations, while maintaining its previous pace.
Minus the Bear’s sound on its new album, Omni, is a mix of funk-inspired electronic rock, well-placed harmonies and instrumental layering.
Peculiar song titles, thought-provoking lyrics and first-rate recordings were not the only features of the band on display at the show. It quickly became evident that Minus the Bear places intense focus on creating a successful and engaging live performance — a trait that makes it a stand out among bands claiming a unique sound and mixed style.
“We feel like the live show is really where you get to see what we’re doing,” guitarist David Knudson said.
Such dedication to establishing a personal connection with audiences is part of what makes Minus the Bear performances so loved — and why the band works so hard to be precise in its timing.
That isn’t to say, however, that the band does not have fun — on the contrary. Minus the Bear’s proclaimed live dedication translates to a joyful — and somewhat edgy — feel during shows.
The set opened with “Secret Country,” a track from the band’s new album. After encouraging attendees to come down from the balcony area in the theater and further fill the already-packed first floor, Snider and the rest of the band launched into an energy-driven show that never slowed down.
Minus the Bear followed “Secret Country” with “Memphis & 53rd” and “Thanks for the Killer Game of Crisco Twister,” tracks from previous albums Menos el Oso and Highly Refined Pirates, respectively. Fans joined in, clapping along with the beat and swaying back and forth. The crowed eventually started singing along, revealing a deep knowledge of the band’s lyrics.
One of the standout numbers of the night came from a song off the band’s 2007 album, Planet of Ice. Played with passion in addition to its characteristic energy, “Burying Luck” allowed the band members to demonstrate their tight-knit relationship. Without a missed note or flustered strum, the band put its musical knowledge on display in a flawless rendition of the song — a sure sign of a solid group that translates well from studio recordings to live performances.
“Prepare yourselves,” Snider said as the band transitioned into “My Time,” a recent release off of its latest album. If the shouts and happy screams from the crowd were any indication, the Omni track was one of the night’s favorites.
The 15-song set might have ended too soon for the enthusiastic audience members, who, at the end of “Absinthe Party at the Fly Honey Warehouse,” demonstrated with hoarse voices their desire to hear more Minus the Bear.
The two-song encore opened with “Knights” and ended with fan favorite “Pachuca Sunrise,” both from albums released prior to Omni. The serene opening notes and extended instrumental ending of “Pachuca Sunrise” rocked The Wiltern and gave longing fans more time with their beloved, quirky and insightful lyricists and musicians.
Minus the Bear, as a group, knows how to bring joy to live listeners. If it hadn’t felt like a Friday night before the band stepped onstage, Minus the Bear left The Wiltern with a happy audience who felt like the party had just begun.

Fall can be a morose season for college students, especially as Halloween draws near. It’s the time of the year when students are reminded once again that they are now grown-ups.
Instead of romping through mounds of leaves and asking for candied apples, they are the ones raking in the leaves and paying for their own sweet treats
Students are also now smack in the middle of the school semester, weighed down by the responsibilities of schoolwork, exams and projects. Worse, come Oct. 31, they can no longer confidently strut from door to door, singing “Trick or treat!” with endearing, gap-toothed smiles. Prancing around dressed as Lady Gaga will no longer attract amused sighs of “awws” but will instead draw disapproving glares from conservative neighbors.
But that doesn’t mean college students should stay at home and wallow in discounted bags of seasonal Kit Kat bars. Besides the crisp and cool weather, fall breezes in with its own share of excitement and fun, such as the celebration of its most popular seasonal produce, pumpkin.
For the stressed out student, a break from studies and a descent into pumpkin cuisine might just be the remedy for fall blues. Find a weekend to leave behind your textbooks and go on a pumpkin-feasting trip.
Carpool with your roommates in the morning to the nearest IHOP and order the seasonal pumpkin pancakes: a stack of four orange, fluffy pancakes topped with a creamy dollop of whipped cream and cinnamon.
This sweet and satisfying breakfast is only $4.99, but if you don’t want to go all the way to a restaurant, you can also easily whip up your own in the kitchen. Mix together a cup of your favorite pancake mix, a half-cup of canned pumpkin purée, a tablespoon of brown sugar, a tablespoon of vegetable oil, a pinch of cinnamon and about a three-quarter cup of milk and cook according to box directions. Serve with Trader Joe’s pumpkin butter, its new pumpkin cream cheese or both.
For lunch, hit up Shojin in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo neighborhood. Although the Halloween menu is not out yet, Shojin is a macrobiotic vegetarian Japanese restaurant that has always celebrated pumpkin in uniquely delicious — and nutritious — ways.
Try the new Shojin roll, which is a sushi roll stuffed with kabocha pumpkin tempura, grilled shitake mushrooms, hijiki seaweed, fried tofu, Japanese mountain yam, cucumber and a Japanese herb called shiso. The sushi uses brown rice for added nutrients and fiber, which also adds a nice chew and earthiness to the roll.
Or dig into the pumpkin croquette, a savory mound of pumpkin mash coated in breadcrumbs before being fried. There is a surprising depth of umami flavor in the croquette, reminiscent of Mom’s chicken broth.
If you’re not feeling up for Japanese, how about Thai? Many Thai restaurants include pumpkin specials in their menu at this time of the year. Bulan Thai Vegetarian Kitchen on Melrose offers an excellent vegetarian dish called busara pumpkin — chunks of kabocha pumpkin sautéed with tofu cubes. The pumpkin is intensely sweet but is gently balanced out with a mildly spicy curry sauce perfumed with fresh basil.
Later, as the temperature climbs up and the mid-afternoon munchies hit, bike down to Jack in the Box and sip on its seasonal pumpkin pie milk shake.
Jamba Juice also offers its seasonal Pumpkin Smash smoothie, but Jack in the Box serves up a pretty decent shake cheaper at about $2.50 for its regular size. Sweet and milky, topped with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry, the pumpkin flavor is meek but distinctive, with a fragrant undertone of spices.
If you start feeling guilty about the calories in the shake and want something healthy to assuage the guilt, take a trip down to Koreatown for dinner and visit Bon Juk for its pumpkin porridge. The porridge is sweet like a dessert, thick like pudding and luscious and creamy with chewy rice dumpling balls and flecks of adzuki bean. The dish is so rich and satisfying that you’ll almost feel like you’re cheating on your diet.
But perhaps you’d rather continue with your day of indulgence. Take a short metro ride Downtown to Zucca. With a name that means “pumpkin” in Italian, Zucca knows how to cook pumpkin right.
Get the Zucca Pizza, a classic brick-oven pizza topped with roasted butternut squash, tangy goat cheese, onions and ham. The slightly caramelized squash, strange as it might sound on a pizza, actually marries deliciously well with the salty ham and savory onions, while giving an appetizing burst of color.
For something richer, try its signature tortelloni — plump dumplings filled with deep orange squash, served drizzled with sage-infused brown butter, crumbles of crisp amaretti cookie and sharp Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for both crunch and ooze.
Finally, finish off the day with Downtown Urth Caffé’s famous pumpkin pie. It’s almost $7 for a slice, but every penny is worth it. It is hard to find a pumpkin pie that does both the crust and the filling right, but Urth Caffé’s pie is a perfect package.
The crust is thick and crackly like a cookie with a zingy punch of ginger, and the filling comes with just the right amount of spice and sweetness — a perfect sweet ending to a pumpkin-filled day.
You might no longer believe in pumpkins turning into magical chariots, but it takes nothing more than a hardy appetite and a willingness to enjoy the present to let pumpkin whisk you away into a magical, if not delicious, autumn ball.

Thursday evening was a night of glamour, live performances, celebrity appearances and philanthropy at the inaugural Choose to Fight On Fashion Show at the Galen Center.
Photo by Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Founded by Candace Ravan, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business)and Tattijani Ribeiro, a junior majoring in fine arts, Choose to Fight On is an organization dedicated to spreading awareness about breast cancer.
“We were surprised to find out that there wasn’t a breast cancer awareness group at USC, nor had there been any student-run events benefiting this cause,” Ravan said. “We decided to take it upon ourselves to organize the first.”
Ribeiro, too, was surprised by the absence of a breast cancer awareness club at USC. Growing up in Marin County, Calif., which has one of the highest rates of breast cancer in the United States according to the county’s Department of Health and Human Services, disease awareness and prevention was an integral part of Ribeiro’s adolescence.
Founded this year, Choose To Fight On’s goal is to “inspire others to work for change and to keep fighting on against breast cancer,” according to its mission statement.
The club partnered with the Noreen Fraser Foundation and its “Men for Women Now” campaign. Founded by Fraser, a stage IV breast cancer survivor, the Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to fundraising for research into detecting and treating women’s cancer.
The organization’s most recent “Men For Women Now” program urges men to encourage the women in their lives to eat healthy food, exercise regularly and not smoke. With a heavy emphasis on early detection, the campaign also urges men to adamantly encourage women to schedule an appointment for an annual mammogram and pap smear, as well as to frequently perform self-breast exams.
Fraser opened the evening with a heart-felt speech expressing her gratitude to Ravan and Ribeiro for donating all of the event’s proceeds to her foundation.
“I am thrilled to be working with USC students,” Fraser said. “Every step we can take to promote healthy living and educating in this community is an important one.”
Joining her on stage was 90210 star AnnaLynne McCord, who attended the event to support her grandmother, a two-time breast cancer survivor.
Before the fashion show began, guests enjoyed an open bar and mingled with each other in the brightly lit red room. Groups of girls in wide-legged jeans and sky-high heels clambered over booths set up by clothing designer Superdry and tanning brand Fake Bake.
Champagne glasses and clutches were put down momentarily as girls eagerly grabbed pens and signed up for $10 spray tans after the show and entered a raffle to win free clothing.
The event was representative of many facets of the USC student body — Greek students, athletes and various student-run organizations showed their support by walking the runway and promoting the event with viral videos.
Attendees took their seats as Evan Paley, a senior majoring in communication, took the stage as emcee for the evening. One of USC’s a capella groups, the SoCal VoCals, kicked off the event, quickly followed up by sophomore singer Rozzi Crane who belted Cee Lo’s “F*ck You.”
Then, the show began. Students modeled a variety of styles by Moo Moo, Crap Eyewear Glasses, Superdry and Seaweed Denim.
“It was so great that the night took the fun and glamour of fashion and utilized it to bring awareness to such an important cause,” said Shannon Goddard, a sophomore majoring in business administration and one of the night’s models.
Fellow model Hannah Gotfredson, a sophomore majoring in communication, agreed.
“It was a night about friends supporting their friends in the show, and ultimately about us supporting the fight against cancer,” she said.
As the show wound down, Paley came back on stage, strutting down the runway clad in a bathing suit and carrying a life preserver. Paley’s final message was to urge men to be lifeguards for the women in their lives, and for women to be lifeguards for themselves against breast cancer. As he finished, the crowd burst into a standing ovation.
“It was not only a night filled with entertainment, but it was an extremely empowering night for women,” said Natalie Cohen, a sophomore majoring in communication.
Say Yes To Fashion And Support Breast Cancer Research…

The USC women’s volleyball team began a four-game stint at home this weekend with two convincing wins over conference foes Oregon and Oregon State.
The No. 8 Women of Troy took on the Oregon State Beavers at the Galen Center Saturday night as the second part of their weekend matchup against the Pac-10’s Oregon schools.
USC swept the Beavers in three sets, 26-24, 25-20, 25-16, utilizing its wide arsenal of scorers including junior All-American outside hitter Alex Jupiter who racked up a match-high 16 kills on the night and freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard who recorded eight kills with three blocks.
Junior setter Kendall Bateman, who was coming off a stellar performance against Oregon the night before, posted 41 assists for the Women of Troy, while sophomore outside hitter Katie Fuller managed nine kills and six digs on the night.
USC hosted the No. 16 Oregon Ducks the night before and managed to come away with a victory after five hard-fought sets, 25-21, 25-20, 24-26, 23-25, 15-10.
Though the Women of Troy were outplayed in the service department, with Oregon’s seven aces overpowering USC’s one lone ace and nine service errors, USC held on and managed to beat the ranked Ducks and move that much closer to Pac-10 supremacy.
Jupiter led USC with 10 digs and 20 kills, two of which came at very key moments during the final set.  Kendall Bateman kept things moving for USC and picked up a career-high 71 assists against the Ducks.
Junior middle blocker Lauren Williams had one of her most impressive games of the season thus far, as she contributed a season-high 17 kills and hit .640 in Friday’s match.
The Women of Troy continue their Pac-10 home stand next weekend with matches against Washington State on Friday (Oct. 29) at 7 p.m. and Washington on Saturday (Oct. 30) at 3 p.m.

There is no denying that Friday’s rally with President Barack Obama focused more on promoting Democratic ideology than on the students who came to see the president speak.
But setting aside the partisanship that characterized the event, the underlying call to arms was a crucial one: Vote in the upcoming midterm elections.
There is a tired, overused laundry list of reasons why young adults don’t participate in elections, especially ones that won’t decide the presidency: not being registered, not having enough time, not being informed on the issues, not being politically inclined.
These reasons are common and easy to identify with, but their ubiquity does not make them justifiable. For students considering not voting on Nov. 2, it is time to re-evaluate.
Register ahead of time, set aside the few minutes that it will actually take to vote and get informed. Realize that these elections will decide the course of the next two years of policy, and that some aspects of them, such as the California governorship, are likely to affect students more quickly and comprehensively than the presidential elections ever will.
As a state known for being progressive, California’s new policies — which, depending on election results, could include air pollution regulation or the legalization of marijuana — will set precedents for the rest of the nation.
Several states, including California, are having gubernatorial elections as well, meaning that regardless of where they’re from, there’s cause for all students to get involved.
Students claiming to be uninformed have the resources to get informed, and quickly. The CA Propositions Voter’s Guide, compiled by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, for instance, explains all the propositions in question in less than four pages.  In a world where information is literally available at the tips of our Internet-savvy fingertips, we can afford to spend 30 minutes less on Facebook to read up on the candidates and issues at hand.
The content of the 2010 midterm elections is relevant to the entire student body. Not voting means not having a voice in the future of taxes or the next leader of California political policy. This election is the next step for the state — come Nov. 2, students should make the effort to cast their votes and be a part of that step.

Campus was abuzz last week in preparation for Friday’s “Moving America Forward” rally, one of the Democratic National Committee’s latest in a slew of college visits aimed at protecting Democrat incumbents by rallying the youth vote.

The headliner was a man who had rewritten history, conjured up a collective youth political passion, agreed with us that Kanye West is a jackass and caught a fly with his bare hand.
The anticipation was at fever pitch.
But with the onslaught of visitors, rampant confusion among organizers and the partisan tilt to the proceedings, it was a bittersweet day for the brave students who made it to Alumni Park to hear President Barack Obama tell us to Fight On.
Not since Willy Wonka had there been such commotion about the color of tickets. At 9:30 a.m., volunteers for the event came around to pass out green tickets, which we were told would secure us a spot in the front near the president.
Five minutes later, other volunteers made the rounds again, this time passing out blue tickets. A general uproar ensued: What did the blue tickets do? Were they better? Scrums began forming around volunteers, people madly grabbing at the pieces of paper, shaking their tickets like little red books. Everyone wanted one of each — a rainbow bouquet of miscommunication — just to be safe.
By 10 a.m., a variety of technicolor tickets had forced their way into existence via the gossip mill. Rumors made their way up and down the line about scores of new tickets, each granting better seating than the last. One woman a few feet from me in line was under the impression there was a special pink ticket somewhere out there that would grant the carrier practically unfettered access to the president.
Disorganization at the entrance to the rally owed to the sheer volume of people on campus. Volunteers were earnest but entirely unequipped to deal with the chaos, and organizers resorted to telling crowd members to ignore them altogether.
“If a volunteer tries to take your ticket,” one shouted at the crowd near the metal detectors, “do not let them.”
We were camels trying to pass through the eyes of needles, but that was to be expected with a turnout of 37,500 people. Admission was open to the public, and though it was exciting to see the community come together, it quickly became clear throughout the rally that the purpose had shifted, perhaps to accommodate a group of listeners that were not all young.
Though the purported intent of the rally was to drum up the youth vote, (and, should the youth vote Democrat, that would not be the worst thing), the message was quickly diluted by the overly partisan speeches and glut of warm-up acts.
Gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown — not the best orator in good circumstances — received one of the loudest applauses of the day when he began his address by announcing he wouldn’t be speaking long.
Finally, Sen. Barbara Boxer introduced the main attraction, and the president took the stage. His 20-minute speech captivated the audience, but surprisingly, given his usual diplomatic reserve, rehashed the general theme of the rally: Republicans are sending us to hell in a handbasket.
Obama spent a good four minutes elaborating on the metaphor of Republicans driving the country into the ditch, with Democrats pushing the stalled car out while Republicans simply throw dirt around.
It was not the most eloquent the president has ever been, and when it turned out the whole spiel was a set-up for a punchline about the initials of “reverse” and “drive,” it was hard not to be dispirited.
Obama hasn’t been faring as well with the youth vote in the polls recently, something he only addressed peripherally by asking the crowd to summon up the fervor of the 2008 election. A recent AP/mtvU poll shows that the president’s approval rating among college students has dropped from 60 to 44 percent.
If he was hoping to raise his stock at USC, he might have slightly missed the mark. Getting students to appreciate such a complicated beast as politics is difficult, and partisanship is a major deterrent.
Had Obama’s rally truly been a rock the vote event, a series of speeches aimed specifically at the youth demographic  with one unifying theme — get to the polls on Nov. 2 — the occasion would have been less muddied.
Anyone who attended Friday would attest that it was a memorable event. Snafus in planning are bound to happen when a crowd of more than twice the size of the undergraduate population is squeezed into less than a mile radius.
But the youth — the very votes the Democrats are trying to snare — were not placed at the forefront of the rally, in admission and in content. Because of this, the day was ultimately underwhelming.
It was an historic event, and an unmissable one. But it was far from inspiring.

Gotta love the ditch metaphor. If Obama drives his car into a ditch, he thinks he should put the car into “D” to get it out. Wait a minute…
You’re doing the metaphor wrong.  The ditch and the D/R were completely different metaphors, the only thing in common was that they both involved cars.  Active listening, my friend, it will take you a long way.
Title : A businessman is angry at his lost cash bag.
　
A businessman is drowning in the ocean.
　
Stimulus :   we should rescue him immediately.
　
Power first :  Nope !  How do we pay for it  ?   Just let him go under much like Lehman Brothers.
　
Stimulus :   He is dying right now.
　
Power first :  Nope !  You can’t save his money bag.
　
Stimulus ( clock is ticking ) : :   We can do everything.
　
Go under :  We are serious about jobs. Where are jobs ?, echoed by the angry businessman. 
Chanting deficit     :
　
1.      Amid chanting deficit, the same old failed policy.
　
2.      Amid chanting deficit, hands-off approach over huge trade deficit from oil money spill & trade imbalance with China from remorseless health care premium.
　
3.      Unfortunately, as a direct consequence of remorseless health care premium,  numerous folks have no choice but to hang onto affordable offerings,  since one in two households is said to face a hard decision between necessity  & drug.
　
4.      Inaction cost in relation to health care reform totals $9trillion over the next decade. 
5.      Over the next 10 years, total Bush tax cut costs will equal $3.9 trillion, …. the tax cuts would increase deficits by nearly $4 trillion between 2005 and 2014.
　
The most critical debt     :    Personal Bankruptcy
　
The current recession came from Personal Bankruptcy largely as a consequence of the relentless health care costs, pain at the pump, and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis.
　
Facing huge trade deficit ( job creation money ) from oil money spill & trade imbalance with China, the primary economic policy of previous administration was ” spending baby “to the great delight of republicans’ sponsors.
The rally’s primary purpose was ALWAYS to be a campaign event. The secondary purpose was to get out the youth vote, but the White House and the Democratic Party always intended this to be a campaign stop, a chance for President Obama to stump for Democratic candidates in California.
You’re right, Scott.  I would even argue that the REAL goal of the entire event was to raise money for Boxer at her private luncheon in the Campus Center.  Having 37,000 people show up to see the speeches was a nice side-event to get media coverage for the Dems.
And I disagree with Lucy–I thought the car metaphor was humorous and worked well with the overall tone of the event.  This was not a “we shall transcend the red state/blue state divide to become a more united nation” speech, this was a “Republicans bad, Democrats good, please go vote!” speech, and if anyone showed up to the event thinking it would be otherwise, they should have done their homework or just used some simple common sense.  It’s less than 2 weeks until an election that is going to be bad news for the President’s party, who honestly thought this was going to be anything but a campaign stop?

Glee — a TV show about outcasts, divas and geeks — has certainly proven it’s a favorite, winning four Emmys this year along with a steady following of self-professed “Gleeks.”
Some, however, aren’t the biggest fans.
This week the Parent Television Council condemned the show for a “scandalous” photo shoot of three of Glee’s notable actors — Lea Michelle (Rachel Berry), Cory Monteith (Finn Hudson) and Dianna Agron (Quinn Fabray) — featured in the November 2010 issue of GQ.
The group’s outrage was aimed at both the show and the magazine. Tim Winter, the president of PTC denounced the photos, saying, “It borders on pedophilia.”
In one photo, Michelle was featured in a provocative pose, lollipop in hand, wearing a thin shirt over a lacy push-up bra and underwear.
The irony lies in the fact that although Michelle (24), Agron (24), and Monteith (28) play high school students, they are not in high school.
Winter also criticized the show, saying, “[Glee] is far from appropriate for young viewers.”
Although GQ responded by saying the PTC, “must not be watching much TV these days and should learn to divide reality from fantasy,” Agron apologized in her blog saying, “If you are hurt or these photos make you uncomfortable, it was never our intention.”
The ongoing question of course remains.  Is TV, becoming too overtly sexual, unfit for children and degrading toward women, or is the PTC just overreacting?
