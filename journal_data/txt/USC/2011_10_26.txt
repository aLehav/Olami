Halloween is on the horizon. As students plan parties, don costumes and consume candy and other substances, the Dept. of Public Safety said it plans to keep a close eye on festivities.
“It’s parent’s weekend, Halloween and there is a major home football game,” DPS Capt. David Carlisle said. “Add in the party at the Shrine, and I am confident DPS will have a busy weekend.”
The Shrine is hosting the fourth annual HARD Haunted Mansion, an electric music festival, on Friday and Saturday.
After attending HARD last year, Jackson Roddy, a then-freshman majoring in accounting, fell out of a window on the sixth floor of Birnkrant Residential Hall. Roddy sustained serious injuries, but is expected to return to USC in spring 2012, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson.
“The vast majority of students are able to take care of themselves and remain in control, but students need to take care of each other and help each other out if necessary,” Jackson said.
Carlisle said students should not hesitate to contact DPS or another emergency service if they need help.
“From the time students attend freshman orientation until they are seniors, DPS encourages them to make smart decisions,” Carlisle said. “Smart decisions mean students who use alcohol use it responsibly, illegal drugs are avoided and students adhere to Trojans Care For Trojans. This means that students should not let their fellow Trojans make poor decisions.”
Conner McMains, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies and biological sciences, said he believes programs like Trojans Care For Trojans help keep students safe at raves and similar events like HARD, which does not classify itself as a rave.
“I’ve attended a rave before and the keys to staying safe at these types of events are hydration and staying around people you know,” he said.
Though McMains said he was alarmed when he first heard about Roddy’s fall, he said he will not avoid rave-like events because of it.
“The bad stories are the ones you hear about, and they happen rarely,” McMains said. “If one is conscious, cautious and plans ahead, the event should be safe and fun.”
Cliff Liu, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism, said he plans to attend HARD but does not plan to take drugs or drink alcohol.
“I don’t need to take any precautions — none,” Liu said. “I don’t do drugs or drink and it is not my problem for those students who go too far with alcohol and drugs. They should monitor themselves because it is their bodies that they are damaging.”
Jackson, however, said students should watch out for each other at HARD and other Halloween parties.
“DPS can only do so much to ensure student safety,” Jackson said. “It’s a matter of common sense. Go out and have fun, but keep your wits about you.”

Singing the popular song “Bulletproof” by La Roux, Simone Battle, a sophomore majoring in music industry, wooed even the notoriously harsh critic Simon Cowell during her audition for the new Fox music competition show, The X Factor.
Tuesday night, after singing “Just Be Good To Me” by the S.O.S. Band, Battle failed to make it to the final 12.

As soon as Battle arrived at USC in her freshman year, she began preparing her audition material for The X Factor.
“She’s really a dedicated and inspiring individual,” said Chris Sampson, associate dean of popular music and music industry. “Her success comes from her dedication to keep learning and always keep an open mind.”
Battle’s experience at the USC Thornton School of Music was key in helping her secure a spot on The X Factor. She chose to major in music industry so she could perfect her music talent while becoming business savvy.
“It’s been my dream to be an artist, but I’ve always valued education,” Battle said. “I chose to major in music industry so that I wouldn’t be ignorant to the business side of my profession.”
Battle said with the business skills she acquires through the music industry major, she hopes to one day start a business of her own.
“Like Madonna, I’d love to run my own company one day, and without understanding how the industry works, I can’t be a good businesswoman,” Battle said.
Simone is recognized as a hardworking and talented performer by her professors, Sampson said.
“As a songwriter, Simone has incredible skill for writing hooks — both musically and lyrically,” Sampson said. “If produced properly, you could certainly imagine her songs on the radio.”
Battle aspires to enjoy great success as a performer and become a symbol in the music industry.
“I’ve always dreamed of being a pop icon, a world touring, diamond selling, history making, philanthropic artist,” Battle said.
Sampson said Battle’s unique voice will be instrumental to her success.
“As a performer, Simone clearly recognizes that you have to have distinctive vocal qualities to stand out in the profession and she was always willing to experiment to achieve this,” Sampson said.
Battle said she plans to use her experience on The X Factor to enhance her music career.
“The X Factor was a fun diversion from my path,” Battle said.  “I’m moving forward with no regrets and I plan to build an enduring music career.”
Interesting this girl can’t sing! but she and Rhianna might have to battle it out for sex appeal.

Students said they are mostly supportive of the Obama Administration’s new “Pay As You Earn” program, which aims to help student loan borrowers better understand and manage their student loan debt.
A majority of students said the new program would reduce the financial burden of student loan debt during the first few years after graduation, after Obama announced the program Tuesday.
Obama’s proposed student loan relief program represents a “real savings that will help … graduates get started in their careers and help them make ends meet,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a media conference call Wednesday hosted by the White House.
Pay As You Earn would allow 1.6 million student borrowers to spend no more than 10 percent of their discretionary incomes on student loans. Currently, students with federal loans under the Income-Based Repayment Plan can limit their payments to 15 percent of their discretionary incomes.
A nurse who graduates in 2014, earning $45,000 a year and has $60,000 in federal student loans, for example, would pay $239 a month, compared with $358 under the current plan.
Max Martinez, a senior majoring in environmental studies, said the program would help graduates who earn low salaries.
“Students aren’t making that much money fresh out of college nowadays so it’ll reduce the [financial] load for the first few years,” Martinez said. “I hope they push [the percent of discretionary income] down even more.”
Alexis Whalen, a junior majoring in classics, said the new measures would reduce college students’ apprehension about incurring a large amount of debt during college and not being able to pay it off.
“The program would allow students to [attend] college without fear [of being unable to afford loan payments] and would also reduce the load on students’ families,” Whalen said. “It’s so flexible because it gives students the option to repay their loans either fast or slow depending on their starting salaries.”
Gabriela Chiriboga, a sophomore majoring in environmental engineering, said she would not use Pay As You Earn because she prefers to quickly finish off her loan repayments after college.
“Though it would be good to have a little extra money available every month, I would rather prefer finishing off my loan payments as soon as possible,” Chiriboga said. “Just because I have a little more money, doesn’t mean I’ll spend more.”
The Obama administration plans to bypass Congress and implement Pay As You Earn at the beginning of next year.

The No. 6 Cardinal is one of just eight remaining undefeated teams in the country and boasts a 36 point average margin of victory. It has run up at least 40 points in every game but one. It has held opponents to 10 points or fewer three times. It beat Arizona in Tucson by 27 points. A week ago, it trounced then-No. 25 Washington 65-21.
Stopper · Senior linebacker Chris Galippo and the USC defense will try to slow down Stanford’s vaunted run game, which ranks 17th nationally. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Stanford’s (7-0, 5-0) win against USC last year kicked off its current 15-game winning streak, and the last nine of those wins have come by more than 25 points.
“It’s just the mentality that they have,” Kiffin said. “A lot of people thought they would be lost with all the staff changes, but they didn’t get lost. And then the personnel changing. But it doesn’t matter who’s in [the game]. They just play downhill and physical. They’re relentless.”
The loss of coach Jim Harbaugh — who led the program from a 1-11 record in 2006 to a BCS bowl and a top-five ranking last year — to the NFL was expected to be too much for Stanford to overcome.
Quarterback Andrew Luck is widely regarded as the best in college football and Stanford’s best since John Elway was in Palo Alto.
“I’ve heard people describe him as ‘perfect,’” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “A guy like that, we know he’s their leader. He’s probably the toughest guy on their team. We know what type of competitor he is and it’s up to us to stop him.”
Luck was the runner-up in the in Heisman Trophy vote last season and looks even better this year. Luck has completed 71.8 percent of his passes this season, throwing for 20 touchdowns to just three interceptions and a 180.0 quarterback rating — good for fifth in the nation.
“We’ve got to be able to stop the run so he can’t sit back there all day with play actions,” Kiffin said. “We’re really going to have to be on our coverage and make him make tough throws.”
—
Stanford, however, isn’t all about Luck. Despite all the Heisman hype, the Cardinal is a run-first team. Stanford ranks 17th in the country in rushing offense with nearly 220 yards per game and second in the nation in points scored at 48.6 points per game.
“We’re going have to play great on both sides of the ball up front,” Kiffin said. “There’s no way to beat this team while playing finesse, especially on defense. We’re going to have our hands full.”
The Cardinal often plays with three tight ends in its formation, a versatility few teams enjoy. Tight end Coby Fleener is the Cardinal’s leading receiver with 384 yards and seven touchdowns. His 22.6 yards per catch are good for fourth in the country and best among tight ends.
The diversity of Stanford’s offense puts increased pressure on the Trojan defense, a unit that has played very well as a whole during the last two games.
“We’ve been playing a lot better on defense of late,” Galippo said. “We’ve got to keep up that consistency.”
Galippo, in last year’s loss to the Cardinal, committed an unfortunate late-hit penalty that gave the Cardinal 15 extra yards in its final game-winning drive.
“I think about it all the time,” Galippo said of the penalty. “It was obviously pretty crucial and probably cost us the game. It was a learning experience for me to just be more aware.”

Redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris once again did not practice. Kiffin expanded on the redshirt sophomore cornerback’s injury, saying it’s a nerve problem in his shoulder.
“They test him every day,” Kiffin said. “There’s nothing he can do [right now].”
Freshman running back George Farmer also did not practice after being carted off the field with a leg injury Tuesday. Freshman kicker Andre Heidari and sophomore receiver Robert Woods were both limited. Woods wore a non-contact jersey.

Louis Zamperini, a former USC NCAA champion mile-runner in 1938 and 1939, and World War II prisoner of war, recently received the 2012 NCAA Inspiration Award. The award is reserved for those who use determination, perseverance and dedication to overcome life-changing obstacles.

Zamperini is the second Trojan to win the award. The first was swimmer Mike Nyholt, organizer of USC’s Swim with Mike and the Physically Challenged Athletes Scholarship Fund, who received the award in 2004.
A member of three NCAA teams, Zamperini was the NCAA champion in the mile run in 1938 and 1939, and co-captained the 1940 USC team. He was a three-year letterman and set a record in the mile run (4.08.3) that lasted for 15 years. He also placed eighth in the 5,000 meter race at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany. During World War II, he spent 47 days lost at sea and two-and-a-half years as a Japanese prisoner of war. His experience became the subject of a CBS television feature that aired during the 1998 Winter Olympics. He was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.
Zamperini also wrote a best-selling autobiography in the 1950s called Devil at my Heels, which was re-released in 2003. A biography of his life titled Unbroken was published in 2010 and has recently risen to No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list.
He continues to give motivational speeches to various groups, including military veterans and USC student-athletes.
“An inspiration is probably an understatement,” USC Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone said of Zamperini. “It’s hard to describe the worth, the value of such a treasure as Louis Zamperini … Louis is a true American hero.”
The award will be presented in January’s annual NCAA Convention in Indianapolis, Ind.

Early Saturday morning, hordes of dedicated USC fans and handfuls of Stanford’s faithful will trudge down Trousdale Parkway, across Exposition Boulevard and around the Rose Garden to wait patiently outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum’s peristyle — maybe even in the rain — before ESPN personnel shepherd them into a gated area behind the set of College GameDay.
It’s an interesting practice, to be sure, but one that most can agree is exhilarating, engaging and exhausting, depending on how much sleep one chooses to sacrifice to get a prime location in the corral.
As fun as College GameDay can be for the casual fan who loves to see himself on TV and show undying support for his team, the renowned show’s presence at USC combined with all the accompanying national attention does little more than cultivate false hope this week that the Trojans have a good chance to topple the Cardinal.
The inflation of belief is bolstered as fans begin to think about the game more with the national spotlight centered on the contest.
And the more you think about a subject, the more you will convince yourself the obvious answer isn’t so right.
A rational fan’s first thought on this game probably goes a little something like this: Stanford is undefeated and ranked No. 6 nationally in the BCS polls. The Cardinal has won 10 straight games by 25 or more points. Quarterback Andrew Luck, the consensus No. 1 draft pick in April, leads Stanford into Saturday’s game. And the Cardinal ran for 430 yards last week in a 65-point slaughter of then-No. 25 Washington. USC stands no chance.
That same rational fan can mull things over for a few days in the midst of hype and USC fans growing confidence and might reach the following conclusions: USC’s passing game is great, so that will neutralize Luck’s passing game. USC lost to Stanford by only two points last year, and it might have won if not for some dubious clock operation by the officials. The running game looked kind of promising against Notre Dame, so it will break out on Saturday.
The same thing happened almost exactly a year ago when GameDay came to USC for the game against the Associated Press No. 1 Oregon Ducks. In the weeks leading up to game, the dominant narrative was that the Ducks were too fast, too offensively persistent, too unstoppable.
As the game approached, however, hope grew, and many were convinced USC was going to win.
That didn’t happen. But the false hope wasn’t a bad thing. If being competitive in every game is the goal — and that’s certainly a goal for the Trojans — the last thing you need is a bunch of demoralized fans convinced a loss is forthcoming.
Had GameDay not come to USC last year and had fewer people known about the stakes of the game, the Coliseum likely wouldn’t have seen that fiery atmosphere in the first half that was by far the best in the last two-and-a-half seasons. Sure, it started to erode when Oregon took off in the second half, but it made for an electric environment that should be there every Saturday of the season.
But if overanalysis isn’t the fuel for that false hope, here it is: When fans forgo sleep to stand and cheer, yell and scream, boo and hiss, there comes a point when they’re in too deep. They’ve put far too much energy into invigorating their own team and deriding the other that something has to give. There has to be some return on the mental, emotional and physical investment that many fans are making to see great football. After going to that great extent, for many, a loss just isn’t acceptable.
Fans put in too much time and effort to see their team not show up for a big game. A loss is simply a letdown to fans. Ideally, that’s probably what fanaticism should be every week. But it’s exactly that sort of delirium that leads to implausible expectations and excessive hope.
GameDay is fun, and it serves its purpose to rile up the fans and make for a much more fun and buzzing setting for a football game. But if you’re trying to make a focused, uninhibited prediction about the game, you’d better stay away from the Coliseum on Saturday morning because there will be only elation and confidence, no matter how baseless.

I completely disagree with this article. The fans are exactly that extra push SC needs to show up for the game! Are you saying we shouldn’t cheer simply because we’ll be disappointed if our hopes are smashed tomorrow? We are USC, one of the most stories college football teams in NCAA history, and no one should be discouraging our spirit, ESPECIALLY a member of the Trojan family. Also, if you don’t recall, we barely lost last year in the last moments of the game. We definitely have  a shot, and the fans will help!
How can you be so pessimistic? Way stranger things have happened in college football to count out the Trojans like this. If Texas Tech can go into Norman and beat OU, a team expected to make the national championship and riding a 39 game home winning streak, why can’t a #20 USC beat a #6 Stanford who has only played one team that isn’t pathetic (and even UW only beat Eastern Washington by 3…just sayin’)
USC also only lost by 2 in Palo Alto from a walk-off field goal last season and I think we’ve only gotten better since then. Also, the Farm lost Harbaugh and it’s in LA.
It’s really frustrating to hear people counting us out before the game even starts, especially when it’s our own fan base.
I’ll be at Gameday and I’ll in attendance during the ENTIRE game supporting our school and our team.
Trojan Dad, please have your program take notes on how a program should be run.  A CLEAN Program!
What a dour perspective on the Gameday experience. You should have been at Notre Dame last week. Just FYI the Trojans put on a pretty good show against a team who was a predominant 9 1/2 point favorite and picked by the national media to win the game going away. 
No doubt Stanford is a very good team, but they haven’t played anyone too tough to this point.
GO STANFORD CARDINAL!
Best combo of academic & athletic success!
Take notes on how to run a CLEAN program.

On Saturday, as No. 20 USC hosts No. 4 Stanford, a team that arguably boasts college football’s most recognizable player in Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback Andrew Luck, ESPN’s College GameDay will once again descend on South Los Angeles, broadcasting from the peristyle end of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum starting at 6 a.m.

The last time the show stopped in Los Angeles — for last year’s game against then-No. 1 Oregon — 88,726 people turned out to the Coliseum. In 2008, when ESPN came to see the Trojans play Ohio State, the Coliseum was sold out, drawing 93,607 fans. In fact, GameDay has visited USC on seven separate occasions from 2004 to 2010, and USC has averaged 91,536 fans per contest during those seven games.
“It really helps bring a lot more awareness to the game,” USC Associate Athletic Director of Marketing Jose Eskenazi said. “There’s so much promotion that ESPN puts behind it that it just draws a lot more attention.”
But so far this season, attendance has been well below those GameDay numbers, averaging just 67,918 fans, which puts USC on track for its lowest home attendance since the 2002 season when it averaged 66,852 fans per contest.
Needless to say, players and coaches are hoping the “GameDay effect” and a strong opponent in the Cardinal will draw a significantly larger crowd to the Coliseum come Saturday. As of Wednesday, just 1,000 tickets remain for the game, according to school officials.
“I think it’ll be exciting,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I think the Coliseum will be the best it’s been in years, especially with a great rivalry with Stanford.”
Kiffin wasn’t alone in his optimism. Following Tuesday’s mid-morning practice, junior quarterback Matt Barkley expressed similar sentiments.
“It should be lot of fun with Gameday, and it’s parents weekend,” Barkley said. “Hopefully a lot more people show up.”
The last time the Trojans played at home, an Oct. 1 game against Arizona, the official attendance number was 63,707, the lowest figure since the Trojans hosted Washington on Oct. 19, 2002.
From 2003 to 2008, when USC, led by Pete Carroll, compiled an overall 71-7 record, including two Associated Press national championships and six BCS bowl appearances, an average of 86,599 fans flooded the Coliseum gates on gameday — best among all Pac-10 venues.
But attendance has steadily declined since the Trojans’ Rose Bowl season in 2008.
“Since Carroll left, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a crowd,” said Ray Gutierrez, who has been attending football games at the L.A. Coliseum since the 1986 season. “It comes with the win-loss record … Is that due to the sanctions and diminished expectations? Probably.”
In 2009, Carroll’s final season with the program, USC, which finished the year with a 9-4 overall record and an appearance in the Emerald Bowl, averaged 84,799 fans per game — roughly 3,000 less than the previous season.
And in 2010, the first year of a two-year postseason ban as part of NCAA-levied sanctions, the drop continued, as USC averaged 79,907 fans per contest. The Trojans won eight games that season — their lowest total since 2001.
“Winning, especially here in L.A., seems to drive [attendance] a lot,” Eskenazi said. “We have our core group of alumni, fans and students, but to hit that critical mass — where we’re at 90,000 sometimes — requires more than just our standard posters and schedule cards.”
Though attendance was on the decline, USC’s season average still ranked the highest among all Pac-10 schools. Washington averaged 66,264 fans at its Husky Stadium in 2010 — the second highest in the conference — and UCLA averaged 60,376 per game at the Rose Bowl, third highest.
USC does have an advantage to some degree. The Coliseum’s seating capacity stands at 93,000, which makes it the largest stadium in the conference. Oregon, which was ranked No. 1 overall for much of the 2010 season, sold out all six of its home games, but capacity at Autzen Stadium is only 54,000.
With 10 losses since 2009, USC’s attendance decline is to be expected somewhat according to Jeff Fellenzer, a USC sports, business and media professor.
“It’s a combination of things,” Fellenzer said. “I think it’s a natural reaction to being in the transition from a magical time with Pete Carroll to the realities of a new unproven coach and NCAA sanctions.”
Tickets, however, aren’t cheap, and it has become easier in recent years to keep up with the team without going to the games.
“Every significant college football game on any Saturday is on television,” Fellenzer said. “With the quality of home entertainment systems now and the fact that replay has become a more important issue, there is more incentive to just watch the games on TV unless you have a product that is at a very high level.”
Fans, it seems, expect that Saturday’s product, as the Trojans host what Kiffin describes as arguably the nation’s best team, might be at that level — at least based on ticket sales so far.
“It’s going to be a great atmosphere,” junior left tackle Matt Kalil said. “It’s definitely going to motivate us to get that win.”
Though USC hasn’t reached 90,000 at the Coliseum since 2009, it looks like that might change against Stanford.
“Those are ’SC fans,” Kalil said with a grin. “They want to come to all the big games.”

Though USC holds a 58-27-3 all-time mark against Stanford, recent years haven’t been too kind to the Trojans.
After Jim Harbaugh was hired as the Stanford program’s coach in 2007, the Cardinal has proven to be a thorn in USC’s side, winning three of the teams’ last four matchups.
Defining play · Stanford wide receiver Mark Bradford hauled in a 10-yard pass from quarterback Tavita Pritchard to lift the Cardinal to a 24-23 victory over then-No. 2 USC at the Coliseum in 2007. Stanford has won three of its last four meetings with USC. - Daily Trojan file photo
Talk about a rivalry, however, has not ensued — at least according to USC coach Lane Kiffin.
“Every year is different,” Kiffin said. “We haven’t really talked about [a rivalry] with so many different players and a new staff over there.”
Harbaugh, who served as Stanford’s head man from 2007 to 2010, left in January to take over as the coach of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers. Yet, under new coach David Shaw, Stanford’s blue-collar, hard-hitting mentality hasn’t left for the north side of the Bay.
In its most recent game against Washington, which ranked third in the Pac-12 in rush defense, the Cardinal amassed a school-record 446 rushing yards in a 65-21 rout of the Huskies.
“They’re a real physical running team, and they do things right on every down,” senior wide receiver Brandon Carswell said. “This rivalry has grown a lot because we’re just two physical teams going at each other year after year, and we’re trying to be on top of the Pac-12.”
In 2007, Stanford, a 41-point underdog entering the game, authored one of the most improbable wins in college football history over then-No. 2 USC, scoring 17 fourth-quarter points en route to winning 24-23 on a day in which former USC quarterback John David Booty threw four interceptions.
“We had a really close one in my freshman year [2007],” Carswell said. “That’s the first time we lost to them at home in a long time, and that really started their run of dominating college football.”
In 2008, as the Trojans overcame an early deficit to top the Cardinal 45-23 in Palo Alto. During the convincing victory, it was clear 2007 was still on Cardinal fans’ minds, as many wore “Greatest Upset Ever” T-shirts and the video board showed painful highlights of the 2007 game.
But in the last two years, Stanford has flexed its muscles against the Trojans.
The infamous “What’s your deal?” game in 2009 announced Stanford’s arrival on a national level, as the Cardinal trounced then-No. 11 USC 55-21, handing the Trojans their worst loss at the Coliseum since Notre Dame beat them 51-0 in 1966. On USC’s homecoming weekend, the Stanford band mocked USC during a derisive halftime show, Harbaugh went for a two-point conversion in the fourth quarter even with an insurmountable lead in hand and former Cardinal running back Toby Gerhart rushed for 178 yards and three touchdowns.
“They’re a great team, they have great players and are well coached,” junior left tackle Matt Kalil said, who was a freshman at the time. “They’re very disciplined, too.”
Last year’s meeting was a thrilling 37-35 loss on a 30-yard Stanford field goal by Nate Whitaker as time expired. After not catching a single pass in the previous week’s 32-31 loss against Washington, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods — then a true freshman — finished with 12 receptions for 224 yards and three touchdowns.
Despite Woods’ exploits, USC’s pass defense struggled and was unable to make stops when it counted in the fourth quarter, as current senior linebacker Chris Galippo committed a personal foul on the first play of the final drive to set Stanford up at its 45-yard line.
“Last year was a learning experience for me,” Galippo said. “I need to play smart ball and be aware. This game is big for our program. Out of the next [five] teams we’re playing, we were beaten by [four] of them. It’s frustrating, but we have these next [five] weeks to show that we’ve grown from last year.”
GO STANFORD!

Every meow and then, sequels come along and kill everything that was wonderful about the original.
Four movies later, Shrek is finally living happily ever after. But it wasn’t always mud puddles and moth balls for our favorite ogre. The Shrek series took a hit with its third installment and never regained its strong, original fan base after the fourth film. Attempts at a Broadway musical put the fairy tale back on the map — for a fleeting moment.
But now DreamWorks is attempting to revitalize the franchise by telling the adventurous tale of one of Shrek’s most beloved characters, Puss. A spinoff of epic proportions, Puss In Bootsattempts to hold its own, but gets bogged down with a few fundamental flaws.
Heroic feline · The latest installment of the Shrek saga attempts to shed light on the intriguing history of Puss (Antonio Banderas), but ultimately comes up short with problematic storyline structure. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures
In the film, Puss (Antonio Banderas) finds himself teamed up with Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) to find the three famed magic beans from Jack and the Beanstalk. The trio is after the golden eggs that can be found in the giant’s castle high above the earth — but Jack and Jill aren’t having it.
As with the four preceding Shrek movies, you can expect the witty, borderline-risqué humor that pleased kids and adults alike. Along the same vein, Puss In Boots also does a fantastic job of drawing from pop culture to create hilarious moments that bring the film to life.
Been on YouTube recently? Chances are you’ve stumbled across videos of cats doing the darndest things — like “Keyboard Cat.” These clips have taken the Internet by storm, some generating millions of views. Riding the Internet’s treasure-trove of cat humor, the creators of Puss In Boots have found clever ways to weave cute Internet phenomena into a major motion picture.
The verdict: The humor is purrfect.
The visuals are also well done. Created especially for 3-D, the animation shines as one of the high points of the movie. It’s amazing to watch every individually colored hair on Puss’ body blow in the wind, backed by amazing landscapes brought to life through 3-D depth.
Alongside the animation, the filmmakers take risks by incorporating split-screen techniques into the picture — rare in the animation world. The results of this venture provide some of the best humor, referencing great films such as Adaptation and 127 Hours, which use similar cinematography techniques.
Though the film might look great and make you laugh, it’s hard to overlook Puss In Boots’ catastrophic errors, such as the forgettable characters and the over-the-top story line.
There’s no question Banderas was made to be Puss: His voice, the Zorro references and his strange sense of humor are all perfect for a swashbuckling cat.
His co-stars, however, are lackluster. Hayek as Kitty Softpaws is easily forgettable; she adds no real spice to the repertoire of charismatic Shrek characters.
Humpty Dumpty’s character, walks a fine line between obnoxious and simply not funny.
Humor should have been in the cards for Galifianakis, but the egg clearly lacks funny bones.
At times, viewers will wonder how the film came together. The story makes no sense in the grand scheme of the Shrek universe, and the plot can only be loosely held together by viewers’ adoration of Puss. In fact, the disappointing story could have been easily avoided simply by keeping the Shrek story arc intact.
Yes, we learn how Puss got those “wee little boots” and why he has a sexy Spanish accent. But how did he end up in a dive bar in Far Far Away working as an assassin-for-hire?
Verdict: The storyline is purrticularly unfortunate.
But, as the last two Shrek installments taught us, story isn’t everything. For Puss In Boots, the title character and droll humor are what save the film from vapidity — you’d be kitten yourself to think otherwise.
The film is certainly still light-hearted and fun. Think of it as spending 90 minutes with a friend who can’t tell a good story, but whom you love anyway for their quirks and effort.
Puss In Boots opens Friday in both 3-D and 2-D.

A Halloween weekend in Los Angeles is a little like trick-or-treating: Sometimes you get great candy, sometimes you get a rock.
Your options this Halloween weekend might not seem like anything beyond a Halloween party or rave, but if you look hard enough, you can find plenty of fun, alternative and artsy ways to enjoy the spirit of this creepy holiday. The nooks and crannies of Los Angeles hide ghoulishly good art events. Whether or not you’ve got big plans, check out these events to give your Halloween weekend an artsy twist.
Haunted-House Themed Show, Hive Gallery, Now — Saturday
The Hive Gallery & Studios is an impressive space that houses the work of some of the most intriguing artists around Los Angeles. Until Saturday, you can get lost in a smorgasbord of aesthetic weirdness, with everything from neon, fabric and bathroom installations to the work of almost 60 artists — all part of the gallery’s current “Haunted House” show.
The show includes artists such as Tiffany Silver Braun, who has an eye for macabre colors and details and a penchant for dark humor. The exhibition also includes work from Hollywood-born Pablo Damas, who creates striking pieces with brooding Halloween colors, often with recognizable figures like Frida Kahlo.
Though the show will feature your nightmares transposed onto canvas, it’ll be all of your best ones. Get your fix before the show ends Saturday.
Munster, Go Home! The Hammer Museum — Sunday
Though the Hammer Museum is located in enemy territory (Westwood), it’s still a venerable art museum — and nothing beats a free Halloween event.
The museum will host a free screening of Munster, Go Home! — a flick dedicated to Herman Munster, the head honcho of the Munster family, and his shenanigans. Not every Halloween flick has to be all gore and horror, and this particular one is perfect for your friends who can’t handle Paranormal Activity.
During your visit at the Hammer you’ll also be able to check out works from exhibiting artists such as Zarina, a printmaker and sculptor who focuses on incorporating paper into her works, and Carlos Bunga, who creates large-scale installation works. If anything, it’ll be a silly and entertaining way to spend your Halloween weekend.
Film Series, LACMA — Ongoing
So, is Munster, Go Home! too cheesy or not cheesy enough for you? LACMA’s got a few more options in Halloween flicks to feed your cravings.
Halloween isn’t complete without classics, and you can use the weekend to catch LACMA’s free screenings of horror favorites such as House of Wax, The Tingler and The Fly.
While you’re there you can also check out some great art, like Chinese artist Ai Wei Wei’s “Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads,” a large-scale work that is a recreation of whimsical statues that surrounded a fountain in the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, or ASCO, a collective Chicano group that focuses on performance and conceptual art.
The museum is your playground: Find new art and watch a scary flick while you’re at it. There’s nothing more L.A. and hipster than spending the weekend being artsy while getting into the Halloween spirit.
Boo at the Zoo, Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens — Saturday and Sunday
The zoo might not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of art, but the Los Angeles Zoo’s “Boo at the Zoo” somehow finds a way to merge arts and crafts with creatures of the wild.
Head to the zoo on Halloween weekend to engage in some crafts, including pumpkin carving — the unique Halloween tradition that really is an art form all its own. There will even be demonstrations to aid your pumpkin-carving skills and help you find inspiration for your pumpkin masterpiece.
The event also includes activities like face painting and crazy fun house mirrors to get you into the usual creepiness of Halloween.
 
Though Halloween is notorious for being ghastly and terrifying, Los Angeles is home to myriad fun holiday events. If you look hard enough, there’s something for everybody — even in the art world. Explore these and other art-related events to make your Halloween weekend different from years past and maybe stumble upon your new favorite artist in the process.

Tim Burton at LACMA
Nothing says Halloween like the dark psyche of Tim Burton. If you have yet to see his ongoing exhibition at LACMA, here’s your last chance — the show closes this Monday, serving as the perfect kicker for Halloween.
The show provides an introspective look into Burton’s various roles, be them director or artist, displaying a mélange of his illustrations, animations, photographs, storyboards, costumes and so much more from his personal collection and studio archives.
Specifically, a topiary based on the iconic gardening scene in Edward Scissorhands and giant figure of “Balloon Boy” from his 1997 book The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories will be available for viewing.
The exhibition closes Monday, but it’s ending with a bang. The works will be on display all night Sunday from 12 a.m. to 9 a.m. Monday morning, with tickets discounted at half-off. The show will also be available for viewing until midnight on Halloween.
Make this holiday a Tim Burton Halloween.

Simple Plan
Friday promises to be an interesting night of music at Hollywood’s Music Box.
Constructed in the ’20s, the Music Box is one of Hollywood’s finest historical treasures. With its sleek, broad dance floor and colonnades of booths flanking both sides, the venue is perfect for big crowds and intimate groups. Though the Music Box might look like a classy, opulent ballroom, it functions like a raucous hub of entertainment.
And that’s just what it’ll be Friday. Veterans Simple Plan will headline a night of alternative fun, joining forces with other pop-punk powerhouses Forever The Sickest Kids, The Cab and Marianas Trench.
Enjoy some of the new kids on the pop-punk block, and then reminisce over the flair Simple Plan brought when we were all in middle school and high school. If pop-punk is your thing, or if you’re just still obsessed with Simple Plan, get ready to enjoy the high-energy and interactive pizzazz that has made Simple Plan famous for over a decade.

For the majority of actors working in Hollywood, the process is familiar: Read the script, memorize it and act it out in front of the camera.
For the actors in Like Crazy, it’s a different story.
Long distance · The two main characters in Like Crazy, Jacob (Anton Yelchin) and Anna (Felicity Jones) attempt to make their relationship work with improvisation and organic acting techniques — inspired by Drake Doremus’ direction. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures
Hoping to capture the lust, pain and tender emotions of young love, director Drake Doremus allows his actors to use improvisation to create more organic performances.
“What’s exciting is when the actors listen to each other and let things happen organically — amazing, real, true moments will sort of happen,” Doremus said.
The two stars of the film, Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin, knew improvising wouldn’t be easy. They managed, however, to harness that anxiety to create more realistic performances.
“I think it was a little bit nerve-wracking but that was kind of what was exciting,” Jones said. “It’s challenging with [something] neither one of us has ever done before.”
The roles, however, could not have been acted with spontaneity alone.
“Preparation is vital for something like this,” Jones said. “You have to make sure you have a very clear understanding of who the character is and their journey.”
Yelchin believes the spontaneity allows for audiences to more powerfully connect with the film.
“We’ve been really moved because we made the movie in a bubble and we just did it as an experiment,” Yelchin said. “People can take away [a look] at their own lives and [a look] at their own sense of love.”
Though the film’s writing credits list Doremus and Ben York Jones, it can be argued they acted as more of a guiding force than traditional writers do.
“The writing process mostly entails trying to come up with scene objectives, emotional plot points, subtext, things like that — the dialogue comes later,” Doremus said. “What’s more important during the writing process is to outline the characters and define them and figure out what the story is.”
The film’s production is not the only difference. Many films about long-distance relationships tend to put a more comedic spin on things, but Doremus wanted to portray a different side.
“There are not a lot of movies that really explore [long-distance relationships] in an honest and raw way,” Doremus said.
Doremus found the actors performed more organically when a scene was thought to be finished.
“Whenever I think I’d got it, I’d still kind of let it roll for a few minutes just to see what might happen because you never know,” Doremus said. “It’s kind of amazing what happens to actors when they’re dumbfounded and they don’t know what to do.”
Like Crazy is only Doremus’ third feature, but it has garnered significant praise. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, and Jones won the Special Grand Jury Prize for Acting.
“I think that [the awards and praise are] very exciting,” Jones said. “We just wanted to make sure that we made a film that was as honest and as brave as possible.”
Yelchin, a veteran of indie flicks and big budget films such as Star Trek, The Smurfs and Fright Night, is happy a project he has so much passion for is receiving such high praise.
“You know, this is a different experience,” Yelchin said. “It’s very intimate, and you sort of disappear into this magical cocoon of improvisation that you have so much freedom in.”
Though Doremus is thankful for the praise, the end goal was not awards or recognition. It was to show the importance of love in the most natural way possible.
“Hopefully, [the film] feels like it’s almost a documented relationship that we stole and presented to you,” Doremus said.
Like Crazy hits theaters Friday.

Undergraduate Student Government formally joined the debate over establishing a smoke-free campus Tuesday with the introduction of a senate resolution that recommends adding more designated smoking areas in addition to clearly marking them and enforcing them.
The resolution, which was authored by Greek Senator Andres Guarnizo and Residential Senator Marissa Roy, will be voted on at the USG senate meeting next Tuesday, USG Vice-President Logan Lachman said. It requires a majority vote for passage.
USG senate resolutions communicate the student body’s interests to the administration.
“The majority [of students], in the end, did not want a complete ban,” Roy said during a portion of the Senate meeting devoted to questions about the resolution.
Nearly 65 percent of 1,485 respondents to a USG online poll supported limiting smoking on campus, according to the resolution. In addition, about 40 percent of the respondents favored a change in the university’s smoking policy that includes designated smoking areas.
The proposed resolution also includes a clause noting that “[USG] wants to recognize the rights of all students, both smokers and non-smokers.”
In 2010, the USC Academic Senate and the USC Staff Assembly, the respective representative bodies of faculty and staff, passed resolutions in support of creating a smoke-free campus.
“We want there to be a rule,” Roy said. “We don’t want to go all the way to banning it.”
The resolution can be amended up until the vote next week, Lachman said.

Protests misguided
As a USC political science major, I am appalled that the USC College Democrats are proudly and openly associating with the Occupy Wall Street movement. The USC College Democrats had an Occupy USC protest on Oct. 24 to protest the social injustice done by Wall Street. It’s one thing to oppose corruption and unethical practices of the elite in the private sector, but channeling protests toward Wall Street is futile when rich CEOs can’t solve the problem. The USC Democrats have a two-pronged dilemma by associating themselves with Occupy.
First, the Occupy movement is completely missing the mark. If the people are angry about income inequality, or the fact that the “top 1 percent” is making too much money, they ought to blame the federal government. The reason the unemployment rate is so high is because of oppressive government regulations that prohibit businesses from hiring. Ironically, these same regulations are often proposed and encouraged by the Democratic Party, which has publicly endorsed Occupy. Though I acknowledge that there is corruption in large corporations, the reason we students don’t have jobs upon graduation is because of Washington, not Wall Street.
Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Occupy movement has been openly anti-semitic. In both Occupy L.A. and Occupy Wall Street, there have been numerous cases of people (from all ethnicities and backgrounds) making statements such as, “I think that the Zionist Jews who are running these big banks and our Federal Reserve need to be run out of this country.” Other protesters have been spotted holding signs saying “Jewish bankers” are to blame for the economic crisis, and that, “the Jews control Wall Street.” In one sickening display of anti-semitism, a man in New York held a sign stating, “Hitler’s Bankers — Wall Street.” This concept of the greedy Jewish banker is blatantly anti-semitic and has been seen before, during the 1940s in Germany. Is that really the road USC College Democrats want to go down?
The USC Democrats really ought to think twice before participating in such a movement.
Emily Schrader
Senior, political science
USC College Republicans, chief of  staff
it’s becoming a joke how the greedy jew calims anti semitism when his greed and evil are exposed like the holohoax and the money sent to israHELL.
You are exposed big noses no more the whole world knows it and is on the lookout. Now you are robbing companies to send the money to israHELL to support the other uggly ones
Wow, looks like the USC Republitards had a meeting and came up with “Occupy Shraeder’s Letter Rebuttal”. Way to stay on message guys and know your talking points
I agree with most of the points of the article.  The stuff about anti-semitism kind of ruined it though- just because a few people might have said those things doesn’t mean you can use anecdote to discredit the whole movement.  Sorry Emily Schrader, but ya kind of lost everyone there.
Suggest you all read the other article published in opinion the same day, “American Greed”.  It has to do with Occupy WS also but it makes the case much more eloquently than this article, and without the anti-semitism disparaging bs.
“just because a few people might have said those things doesn’t mean you can use anecdote to discredit the whole movement.”
^The left wing did exactly this when a few Tea Party activists were shown saying racist things at rallies. They even used made-up racist incidents to falsely discredit it (example: the Congressional Black Caucus “spitting” incident, which is still cited by liberal pundits as an example of Tea Party “racism” even though we now know it was completely fabricated).
Ya and they were wrong to do that to the Tea Party too…..I don’t understand your point….
You’re not unemployed because of Wall Street. You’re unemployed because you majored in art history. Maybe you should have studied something useful.
A second note: @person You exemplify the college experience with your instinctive criticism, and total lack of understanding: “Did you see that headline!” “Oh man, can you believe those fascists!!” … “oops, she’s talking about us :(” Thanks for reading the Dana Report.
@Merry, You’re great.
A college student with a sense of responsibility and a love of liberty? It’s a welcome sight and, surprisingly unexpected.
A note to the College Dems: you’re getting a college degree; graduate and get to work. You’ll be fine.  Spending a month living in a park threatening your neighbors to pay your bills, or else, is not the way towards progress.
I want to start off by commending Ms. Schrader and all those who replied for utilizing your right to free speech and voicing your opinion. Sadly, many of you don’t know how to have a civil political conversation without attacking those who don‘t share your viewpoint. I find it embarrassing that we continue to see the same political tactics from those who make personal attacks, and to the reply from “appalled at this letter”- you’re incoherent and unfair response to Ms. Schrader’s article truly portrays what OCCUPY WHATEVER stands for. You don’t believe in hearing the other side, because you are ideologically against the American political and economic system. We’ve seen the OCCUPY WHATEVER tactic utilized over and over again, as a tool for those who believe in BIG GOVERNMENT MANDATES, HIGH TAXES, NATIONAL UNIONIZATION and a continual attack on the liberty and prosperity of the American people. The European model is what occupy strives for, a system where large deficits, big government spending and taxation will allow for the redistribution of wealth to create a more “fair” and “equal” system. How well is that working for Europe? Continue to run these corporations, manufacturers, and the so called 1% out of California/ United States, and maybe the other 99% can share what’s left. In such an ideal world, the median American household can make $30,000 instead of $48,000 a year. Also, to those who say regulations have nothing to do with economics, take a deep look into the California economy. It is evident that job killing, anti-business legislation has turned one of America’s beacons’ of prosperity into a state with the 2nd highest unemployment.
At the end of the day, Ms. Schrader wrote a fair, opinionate piece concerning the occupy movement, one that highlights events that have been reported by major news networks. My relatives in New York have told me about the anti-Semitism they saw in the Wall Street protests- the disturbing signs and anti-Semitic rhetoric. It is necessary for the occupy crowd to take responsibility by expelling these protestors and releasing statements condemning those who are preaching hate.
With the biggest issues in the country being growth and employment I find it shocking that what Emily is saying doesn’t resonate more. Using Wall Street as a whipping boy to salve discontent and anger does nothing to address either of those issues. Even if they got what the wanted putting a CEO in jail, or exacting higher taxes and fees would do nothing for either. Avoiding the discussion of federal, state, and environmental regulation, effective corporate tax rates, and the impact of state supported Union laws, is ludicrous.
Hey, “appalled at this letter” – I am appalled at your ignorance and at your attitude. First, she only pointed out what has been widely discussed in the media. The anti-semitic comments at Occupy rallies are not in dispute…. there have been plenty of them. Good for you and your anecdotal evidence that they weren’t present at USC or in L.A. That means nothing. What’s more, instead of apologizing for or denouncing the anti-Jewish comments, many OWS types (like yourself) wish to pretend they haven’t happened. Fine. If there had been one fraction of as much racism at  Tea Party rallies as there has been anti-semitism at OWS, we would never have heard the end of it. I will grant, however, that this doesn’t have as much to do with the overall point of the protesters – oh, what was that again? According to the rocket scientists posting here, businesses will THRIVE with more regulation, and it’s just what our economy needs to put us all back to work! Yay for more NLRB, OSHA, etc. etc. etc. rules. Good grief; what unmitigated ignorance.
However, I will grant you all have a right to express your opinion, however misguided. In stark contrast to that, we have “appalled at this letter” who is more of what I have come to consider a typical leftist – someone who wishes to stifle all opinion that doesn’t agree with his/her own. How was anything Schrader said “hateful” or “dishonest” or even “ill-informed”? She only stated opinions on widely known topics of interest in the news. She neither made up anything nor expressed hatred toward anyone. But “appalled at this letter” is basically telling her to SHUT UP and that she “doesn’t deserve a seat at the table.” Way to strike a blow for freedom of speech, “appalled at this letter” – and way to engender respect for your opinion, too, by promoting such healthy dialogue! The only hatred expressed so far on this page is that expressed by “appalled at this letter.”
Voice of Reason and Appalled at this Letter- 
I see no reason in insisting that because Ms. Schrader is appalled at the College Democrats supporting a movement that she finds to be misguided, that you insist that the College Republicans disown the Tea Party movement.  Firstly, the USC College Republicans have never sponsored an on-campus protest in solidarity with the Tea Party movement.  Secondly, even if the College Republicans had sponsored such a protest, the Tea Party movement is an openly political movement.  The goal of the Tea Party movement is not to attack private actors, but to affect change through the democratic process: voting out those who do not represent conservative values (including Republicans).  The issue at the center of this debate isn’t the right to hold a protest, but the message of the protest itself.  As another commenter mentioned, no proof of racism was submitted in regards to the Tea Party rallies.  Andrew Breitbart has video footage revealing that the “N” word was never hurled, but I’m willing to bet that in your supposed open-mindedness you refuse to acknowledge or read any media source that is not leftist. 
Also @Voice of Reason.  Emily acknowledges that there is corruption in big business in her introductory paragraph.  Further, she says, “it’s one thing to oppose corruption and unethical practices of the elite in the private sector, but channeling protests toward Wall Street is futile when rich CEOs can’t solve the problem.”  She’s completely right, and though you would rather not agree with her I feel that you must.  The regulations the government has made are oppressive, and hinder job creation in this country.  The government regulations Emily, and most conservatives, oppose are not those that hinder corruption, because those regulations do not seem to exist. 
Also, @appalled at this letter, I was under the impression that the Occupy movements that have sprung up all over the United States are in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement.  Therefore, the signs Emily discusses impact your movement overall.  Please do not make the “a few ignorant people ruin the movement” argument in the same breath that you try to de-legitimize the entire Tea Party movement over a racist myth that, even if it were true, would fall into the category of “a few ignorant people.”  Perhaps you’r anger is a result of Emily’s wise letter that reveals the faults of the movement you’ve been blindly supporting. 
Further, @Jonathon is one of the only commenters providing a fair and balanced reasoned opinion as to why he disagrees with Emily.  However, it would be interesting to have a discussion on how the lack of a central goal of the Occupy movements might foster a space for the opinions of the ignorant.  Please let me know if the Occupy movements do in fact have a concrete goal that I have missed.  The website reveals that the Occupy-ers want everyone to join the protest and be empowered, but what are we to protest for?  What “ends” is the movement attempting to achieve?
I am on the fence about the Occupy protests, but even so, I am still against Schrader’s argument about anti-Semitism to condemn the protests. Even if there were a few anti-Semitic signs or anti-Semites in the Occupy protests, it doesn’t require much reasoning to understand that one individual’s views does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the entire movement. Just because one person in the Occupy crowd happens to hate the Beatles doesn’t mean Occupy hate the Beatles. You say, “This concept of the greedy Jewish banker is blatantly anti-semitic and has been seen before, during the 1940s in Germany.” To try to boost her argument, Schrader attempts to instill a sense that somehow by joining this protest, we will be on the slippery slope toward the Holocaust, though I doubt Schrader truly believes that. That’s just a ridiculous and desperate way to make her argument.
This argument of Miss Schrader’s always manages to give me a laugh. Another chestnut from the geniuses at Talking Point Central at the GOP. What most knee jerk reactionaries fail to understand or connect is that government regulation is the great equalizer in free market economic policies. If I was a car maker and wanted to increase my profit margin in a system without government regulation,  and decided to undercut my competitors, and I decided to eliminate the seat belts or use some inferior Chinese made product,  and say sold Emily her car that she drives to the Reagan Ranch for some conference on how wonderful Reagan was, and say a drunken liberal slams into her car, who would she blame?
Regulation levels the playing field, protects the citizens of the society it is derived in, and ensures that there is a system of standards. What Miss Schrader advocates is a 1% wet dream!
Yeah, it’s true that the EPA and regulatory regimes cost businesses money. But we’ve also seen what happens in the absence of a coherent policy regime protecting worker’s and environmental rights- company towns and strip mining. Remember, before unionization and regulation, the average work day was 12 hours, weekends were only Sundays, and many thousands of workers were paid only in company scrip that was not convertible to currency- effectively slaves.
We can argue about the need for policy reform, or the creation of more effective mechanisms. The answer when something has become outdated is not “burn the damn thing down” it’s “fix it.” Yes, there are a lot of redundant, annoying, and overly bureaucratic regulations imposed on American businesses, but that is also being used as an excuse by capital owners who see the opportunity to roll back many of the rights won by unions over the last several decades. We need a coherent regulatory regime, but only someone with a very limited understanding of American history would say that corporate self-policing is a good idea.
Remember, around the turn of the 20th century America was seen as one of the nations most at risk of a Communist revolution. You know why? Because of how unbelievably degrading the conditions of labor were. In this age of instant mass communication, instigating social unrest and undermining the relationship between labor and capital is very likely to result in significant social unrest, which is really the last thing we need.
America is on the verge of an energy boom, fueled by shale and new fields in North Dakota. If the EPA shuts that down, then we should start complaining, because that will ensure American energy and geostrategic security for decades and it would be unbelievably foolish to pass up such an opportunity (seriously, what else are we gonna do with North Dakota?). But undercutting labor rights and instigating social unrest is not in anyone’s benefit- wages in China are inflating at 12%/year, and the dollar has fallen 37% in the last decade, soon American labor will be priced competitively again and we’ll be panicking a little less. Just because we’re in a bit of a competitive downswing doesn’t justify skyrocketing income inequality in the US…
Shocker, a USC College Republican opposes a movement channeling middle class anger. Does this really surprise anybody?
First of all, you have grossly simplistic understanding of the relationship between government regulation and business success, so you have not reason to insert a comment about it in your letter.
Second and much more importantly, as a student that participated in the protests both at USC and Occupy LA, I did not see ANY anti-semitism either time. If I did, I would vigorously condemn it and would probably have left immediately. Your evidence is utter hearsay, because you disagree with a particular movement, doesn’t mean you have the right to attempt to discredit it by disseminating a vicious rumor. Maybe there have been a few examples of ignorance, but I am confident – as a person involved in the movement – that those people DO NOT SPEAK FOR THE REST OF US.
The tea party protest featured plenty of examples of blatant racism, but that doesn’t mean that I would attempt to call all people who agree with tea party racists.
You are a hateful, ill-informed, dishonest person, please stay out the political debate because you do not deserve a seat at the table.
I find it interesting that the person who wrote this letter fails to mention that in another article she wrote, she claims that it was Tea Party members who were making the anti-zionist remarks… 
http://danareport.com/2011/10/21/tea-party-protests-spiral-out-of-control/
OK i didn’t actually read the end where she says she’s actually talking about occupy wall street. my bad.
It’s by far not a settled question over whether or not FDR era regulations restored the country to economic balance, and most of the enduring regulatory and administrative overhauls are not generally related to promoting economic growth such as FDIC commercial bank insurance and Social Security. Calling for the re-establishment of Glass-Steagall is one thing, something a lot of people endorse. But to argue that regulation in and of itself is what leads to economic growth is foolish. Regulation at its core is only intended to slow economic boom and bust, and as a rule doesn’t promote rapid growth. The key is always to balance regulation with liberalism. 
To argue that we don’t have a crippling problem with federal regulation is an outrageous oversight. Our corporate tax rate both at a statutory rate and at an effective rate is one of the highest in the OECD. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is the bane of mass manufacturers issuing enormous fines and hitting out at companies who choose to go to right to work states and cripples companies when it comes to arbitration. Just look at how the NLRB is bending Boeing over the table for trying to shift to South Carolina. Our export regulatory controls are so labyrinthine, archaic, protective, and union slanted that it prevents the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates that just modernizing the system would create 350,000 jobs, while its important to remember that this is what pretty much killed the US shipping industry in the 1970’s-1980’s by mandating and regulating the % of crewmen and workers who had to be American and flew the US flag. Now our only dry docks are in Norfolk and a few scattered naval bases. 
That doesn’t even touch on environmental regulation. Whether or not you think it is an important task or not, the fact of the matter is that environmental standards butcher job creation. The EPA’s MACT, Coal, Boiler, Cement, Fertilizer, etc regulations kill hundreds of thousands of jobs by increasing compliance costs and reducing a companies bottom line and employment hiring accounts. Something as simple as industrial machinery and boiler regulation can dramatically increase manufacturing costs. 
The Commerce Department says that regulation costs businesses 1.75 trillion in compliance costs, and the number could be higher. To ignore the role of regulation on jobs production, the issue really at the heart of this crisis, is outrageous.
Voice of Reason? More like voice of unhinged Leftist babbling. No, VOR, we don’t need more regulation. You can rewrite history all you want, but what has made America the greatest and most prosperous country in the world has been free market capitalism, which is what these useless tools of OWS are protesting. Frankly, it’s laughable. 
What’s more, your extremely simple-minded comparison of OWS anti-semitism – well documented and apparently somewhat widespread – to Tea Party “racism” shows that you have the intellectual depth of a puddle. How about you dig up some proof of this alleged racism? Because I’m pretty sure that at one point there was a $100,000 reward offered for video of racist comments at one rally (the day healthcare reform passed) and nobody came up with a damn thing. There is no – I repeat NO – equivalence between these two groups. One has lawful protests, cleans up, and goes home. The other has no aversion to breaking laws, leaves a stinking flea- and rat-infested public nuisance, and refuses to go do something productive. So in point of fact Miss Schrader was correct – OWS is a movement the College Democrats should consider avoiding. Tea Party – not so much. Last I checked, there was nothing anti-semitic, racist, extremist or in any way offensive about pushing for a return to limited government and Constitutional principles. 
As for Louise – well, honey, rest assured. At most political science classes at this university, there’s plenty of sheeplike devotion to leftist pet causes and politics. You’re right about one thing – not enough history classes. But the kids who need them aren’t this writer, who demonstrates she can think for herself. The problem is all those sheep kids, who swallow everything, unquestioningly, that they’re told. Your cheap shot at Fox News, which regularly features comment from all sides of the spectrum (unlike, say, MSNBC), simply shows me that you share the intellectual depth of our friend VOR. Why don’t you try watching it before you mouth off? You might learn something.
Your understanding of OWS is incredibly short-sighted and, frankly, embarrassing.  OWS is not arguing against “free market capitalism” nor am I.  I am far from an “unhinged leftist” and the fact that you think I am shows just how out of touch with reality the right has become in this country.  By any standards around the world I would be considered a moderate at worst, likely center-right.  I do not believe in an individual mandate for health care, for example, and I do not believe in government planning of the economy.  What I do believe is that the massive inequality in wealth is bad for the nation and that something needs to be done about that.
The US has one of the largest inequalities of family incomes of any modernized country.  In fact, in 2007 our inequality rating (Gini index) was comparable to that of Bulgaria and is closer to that of 2002 Uganda than to the UK.  Frankly, the position that our deregulated economic regime put us in is what’s laughable.  (You can check my numbers yourself, Merry:  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2172.html)
OWS is not about some bolshevik revolution in the United States.  It is about returning us to a fairer system where CEOs are not paid in a disproportionate manner.  It is about holding firms accountable for their crimes (and denying that there were crimes is simply unreasonable).  It is about maintaining a sustainable capitalist system instead of the unfair and, quite honestly, unsustainable system that has been shoved down the American worker’s throat for the past 30 years.
@Madeline:  First, I don’t think citing to Andrew Breitbart is going to do you much good, it would be the same as me citing to Michael Moore, essentially.  Second, finding racism at the tea party requires about three seconds and a google search.  Quickly:  http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/17/obama.witchdoctor.teaparty/index.html; http://washingtonindependent.com/73036/n-word-sign-dogs-would-be-tea-party-leader
I’m not denying that there may be anti-semitism in OWS, just as I’m sure there is some racism as well.  But to deny that there was a racist element in the Tea Party means that you are not seeing what is right in front of you.
Now that we’ve gotten that silliness out of the way, I’ll address your substantive points.  Demonstrations are about appearances as well as messages, and literally “occupying” Wall Street, ground zero of the greatest financial catastrophe since the Great Depression, sends a powerful message.  If you think these are “attacks” against private actors, you are wrong.  The OWS movement is as much a statement to government officials as it is to the financial industry.  To your second point, can you tell me exactly what regulations are “oppressive”?  Was it the regulation that stopped banks from leveraging themselves 30-1 with toxic assets on their books?  Was it the regulation that has allowed corporations to raid their pension funds to pay for executive raises?  Merry points to the NLRB and OSHA, and the fact that these are the two agencies you describe as “oppressive” is actually terrifying to me.  Doing away with worker safety regulations and collective action powers is sending us back to the bad-old-days of the 1800s.
I have many Republican friends who admire Teddy Roosevelt; if you do not, I understand, but if you do, please go and look at what he did as a “trust buster.”  What we have today is an organized effort by the 1% to undo the changes that he championed, even down to his protection of natural parks for future generations.  The “demands” of OWS are not radical in any way; if you want to see radical, look at the GOP members who are willing to let our country go into default rather than raise the taxes of the super-rich.  Look to the Republican Presidential candidates who have said that they would reject a plan that would cut $10 of government spending if it also included $1 in revenue increases.  That is radicalism, ladies and gentlemen.  Demanding that corporations and their executives, to the extent that they were responsible, be held liable for the massive fraud committed against the American public and that reasonable regulations, such as Glass-Steagall, be put on the financial industry to prevent another Great Recession from happening in the future?  That is decidedly not a radical request.
@voiceofreason… your assessment is spot on and accurate.
@louise.  dont be so harsh to judge.  vor understands the “Occupy” messaging and yes, they are focusing their unfocused energy and ACORN sponsored rhetoric toward the wrong institutions.  They should be protesting on Capitol Hill.
As a parent and concerned citizen I am appalled that a political science major does not think rationally and obviously watches too much FOX news.
I do hope political science majors take history classes.
I’m pretty sure Hitler’s Bankers were not Jewish.  That sign is ridiculous, but how exactly is it anti-semitic?  And unless the College Republicans are willing to disown the Tea Party movement, there is no reason why the College Dems should disown the OWS movement.  I do not condone any anti-semitism within OWS and a few misguided souls do not represent the movement as a whole; I expect that you would say the same thing about the racist signs and remarks made by people who claim to be part of the Tea Party movement.
I will also point out that the Great Recession was a direct result of the deregulation binge that this country went through under the “leadership” of Alan Greenspan and all of the Presidents since Reagan, including Clinton and Obama.  Dodd-Frank is a joke, hardly matching the regulations put in place by FDR to end the laissez-faire gilded age policies; these regulations happened to precede the greatest period of economic prosperity in the country’s history, by the way, but who wants to pay attention to such things?
If we want to put people back to work, we need more regulation, not less.  Never forget that businesses have, throughout the ages, fought progress with threats that new regulations would ruin the economy.  Ending slavery?  Our agricultural industry will tank.  End child labor?  It will devastate business.  Allow laborers to unionize to demand higher wages?  It will lead to the end of capitalism as we know it.  The banks and corporations are making the same arguments now.  Look to the past to see how it has turned out–overwhelmingly, government intervention in business has been beneficial to society as a whole while letting corporations “police” themselves has been devastating.

The best way to describe Occupy Wall Street is as an eclectic movement expressing a shared discontent toward the nation’s distribution of wealth as well as the perceived greed of corporations and Wall Street.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
Though the opinions, grievances and goals of the Occupy protesters are too numerous and diverse to succinctly categorize, there is one observable, important characteristic that separates the protesters into two distinguishable groups.
There are protesters whose primary interest is putting what they see as a rigged system back onto a level playing field where everyone has a fair chance to compete.
The anger here stems from the belief that corporate bailouts are something uniquely un-American, something completely contrary to a system of free enterprise and something that even the top 1 percent would agree shouldn’t fly. For the protesters, the idea is to restore true capitalism — one without supposed corporate greed.
The other group of protesters is primarily concerned with crusading against what it sees as an inherently flawed system based on corporate greed and capitalistic malfeasance. For those, the idea is to eradicate capitalism and the greed it perpetuates altogether.
In response to these protesters who believe capitalism itself is to blame and who have made the concept of greed the main target of their campaign, I would like to quote the famous movie Wall Street: “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.”
Greed is just another term for “self-interest.” The only distinction is that greed is supposedly an excess of self-interest, which for economic purposes is no distinction at all.
The true brilliance of America, aside from its unique heritage, is its economic system in which the pursuit of self-interest generates greater productivity and greater prosperity for the nation as a whole. Even if we completely did away with capitalism and free trade, as some of the protestors would like, self-interest and greed would still exist.
“Tell me, is there some society you know that doesn’t run on greed?” economist Milton Friedman once said. “You think Russia doesn’t run on greed? You think China doesn’t run on greed? … The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests.”
America has prospered because of a system in which the basic human instinct of self-interest is rewarded and channeled into productivity. Individuals are free to make a name for themselves, and in doing so, they can build an economy more beneficial for everyone.
What protesters should understand when addressing problems such as a shrinking middle class, highly skewed distribution of wealth and political system beholden to special interests — all serious problems that require real solutions — is that greed has absolutely nothing to do with them.
Those who rally against corporate greed and companies pursuing profits at the “expense” of everyone else don’t see the full picture. Corporate greed is not greed at all — it’s the basic responsibility of corporations to their shareholders. If there’s a problem with the distribution of wealth in this country, it’s not because of greed. It’s because of the system as a whole, and that lands on the shoulders of the government.
Those who blame the greed of the 1 percent for the plight of the 99 percent completely miss the point. The 1 percent deserves no blame. The bankers on Wall Street have done exactly what they should have done, exactly what anyone in their positions would.

I must commend the author on this one- some really great points made.
The major problem is that governments around the world and the banks/corporations/financial sectors are so intertwined that they are almost one and the same.  The “regulators” are hired from the same sector that they are charged with “overseeing.”  Can you say “conflict of interest?”  Then we have our “leaders” and “representatives,” if we can call them that, who are beholden to the almighty $$$ because that is what got them into power in the first place.  Since multinational corporations operate on a global scale, the executives, stockholders, and the politicians that they buy, are the relative few who benefit from this system.  Call it capitalism, a free market global economy, or the new world order, but BILLIONS of people around the world are slaves to the system’s every whim and desire.  That is called greed and it is not in the interest of the individual; it is in the interest of the oligarchy, period.
Sorry, but greed and self-interest are not good in and of themselves. What makes them good is when they produce productivity that is connected to communities and society at large. Today’s corporations and banks are not tied to communities and not even tied to American society. They are multi-national, borderless entities, who have all the rights of a person but none of the responsibility. They don’t pay fair taxes, and they don’t have any qualms about uprooting the wealth of this country into their private coffers.
Self-interest is based on the principle that people are rational. But people are inherently irrational and only rational only in specific cases. There is a wonderful book, Predictably Irrational, that discusses the scientific basis for our irrationality. All theories of self-interest fail, because they don’t take this into account.
Finally, the government is not solely responsible for this current economic climate. Banks, economics, and corporations heavily lobbied the government to produce this climate for their own greed, and then handed ordinary citizens the bill when it failed. To end the problem, we do need different ways of constructing how banks and corporations use their wealth to unfairly influence the government.
The problems you just mentioned, corporations not paying fair taxes and using money to influence the government- don’t have anything to do with greed and self-interest.  They have to do with laws and government regulations.  I think you just proved the author’s case unintentionally lol
How did those laws and government regulations come about? So I suppose no one is responsible for the failure of our economy? Everyone just showed up to be greedy under some rules that magically appeared?
To change laws and government regulations, we have to get Congress and the President to act. How is that possible when the opposing side has unlimited amounts of money and friends in high places? If that’s the natural outcome of greed and self-interest, then it is wrong and psychopathic.
No it’s simple really.  We have to stand up to our elected officials, and vote them out of office if necessary, to do something about the way lobbying works- campaign finance reform for instance.  I think the author even mentioned that he’s totally fine with protesters who want that.  I mean look at what the Tea Party did, whether you agree with them or not, they used their voice to make their issues the #1 concern and their agenda is succeeding.  So instead of blaming private individuals, blame government and demand a change in the rules.  I think the author put it brilliantly actually, but I’m happy to clarify.
Refreshing point of view.  I consider myself pretty liberal but I can see the merits in this argument.  Definitely not what you would expect from an average college student.
What’s worse…a greedy corporation, a greedy union, or a greedy politician?
All 3 are power corrupted, both have lost their guiding principles, & live off the wealth of others.
So why all the focus on private sector corporations?
The public sector UNIONS, who buy off & control their DNC POLITICIANS are equally to blame if not more so. Their objective is clear: power. control. silence the opposition. “i’m OK, you’re not OK”; my agenda 1st, yours last”, no independent thinking. create dependent minds. Visit ANY Communist/Socialist country & you’ll see how this plays out. 
NO WONDER WHY PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD FLOCK TO THIS COUNTRY. They don’t want to be dependent on others … UNLESS they are the  lazy type that suck the wealth out of the labour or others….like mosquitos & parasites.   
Abraham Lincoln was right when he said…”America’s greatest enemy will come from WITHIN.”
I’m glad to see the DT finally published something reflecting an alternative viewpoint as they so rarely do so.
You had me with you until the end where you said: “If there’s a problem with the distribution of wealth in this country, it’s not because of greed. It’s because of the system as a whole, and that LANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.”  I hate to remind you of your 5th grade social studies but…. WE ARE THE GOVERNMENT!!!  You, me the 99% and the 1%.  To repeat a tired old metaphor “We have the best government that MONEY CAN BUY.”   The 99% are trying to wrestle the power of the government back to the people. The same government that has refused to prosecute the bankers on wall street that caused the recession of 2008-present.  The same recession that has sucked in 5 trillion TAXPAYER/99% tax dollars.  When Enron crashed – the corporate decision makers were tried, convicted and sent to jail.  When Worldcom crashed – the corporate decision makers were tried, convicted and sent to jail.  Where are the trials and convictions of Lehman Brothers executives who’s reckless and dangerous decisions (and 250% bigger than Enron and Worldcom combined) that led to the meltdown?  Where are the indictments and trials of Merril Lynch, Goldman Sachs, B of A executives who also WERE THE MAJOR PLAYERS AND MADE THE SAME RECKLESS AND DANGEROUS DECISIONS?  Capitalism succeeds when everyone is treated equally under our Constitution.  When a group of people ARE ABOVE THE LAW, the law no longer is valid.  If something is too big to fail, it NEEDS TO BE BROKEN UP.  None of that has happened.  Capitalism no longer exists when the government fails to uphold the law and protect those who hurt the very people the government is formed to protect.
You can’t prosecute someone for reckless decisions man.  Enron and Worldcom were frauds, they were illegal by the law.  The author is saying that the system was broken, which was the fault of the government for not putting enough regulation on bankers.  But it wasn’t the fault of the banks.  They might have made stupid financial decisions, but it wasn’t illegal.

When it comes to self-expression, the Internet seems like a glorious free-for-all. There are endless ways to stake out a free piece of this territory, from getting a WordPress blog to posting pictures on Flickr.
Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
But some people don’t just see the Internet as a playground for creative types. Some people depend on the Internet for their livelihoods.
Student entrepreneurs already know the feeling. If current business trends continue, many of us will work for online businesses after graduation. According to The Wall Street Journal, American e-commerce sales grew about 13 percent in 2010 and growth is expected to continue through 2015.
Those who want to monetize their time online might be coming up against a wall: increased segmentation based on domain names.
A new domain name extension for pornographic websites — predictably, .xxx — will be available to all takers starting early December. Though this development might not seem to affect anyone other than budding pornographers, domain name extensions on the basis of business type is a harmful new trend for online businesses.
Online businesses must resist division into arbitrary neighborhoods. Such divisions help neither consumers nor businesses.
It’s getting more and more difficult to label what a business does. Take Urban Outfitters, a store popular among many college students. Most people would call it a clothing retailer, but it also sells coasters and books with titles like Crafting With Cat Hair. 
Some stores completely defy categories. Quaxelrod.com sells merchandise based on jokes from Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel’s parody Twitter account. How do you put a label on something like that?
Labels in the form of domain names would simply narrow consumers’ perceptions of what they’re buying without providing them the benefit of accurate information.
A business with a specialized domain name extension would find it harder to reach out to new kinds of customers; moreover, businesses choosing to keep .com domains would likely lose out on customers looking for something specific. It’s a lose-lose situation.
Still, many people like the idea of making it harder for pornographic websites to reach customers who aren’t looking for that kind of excitement. But pornography is notoriously hard to define. One person’s smut is another person’s masterpiece. Even nudity isn’t a reliable metric: Many famous paintings depict the naked human body in great detail, whereas some pornographic material includes no nudity at all.
More importantly, pornography is a business just like any other. Though no website is forced to adopt the .xxx domain, pornographic websites will be pressured into changing their addresses.
The responsibility to avoid pornographic material must lie with individuals, not with companies. Tired of running into offensive websites? There is plenty of software designed to find pornographic material so one can block it on a case-by-case basis. The software approach has the benefit of allowing people to define pornography for themselves.
To some extent, the Internet is already divided into neighborhoods. Browsers can reasonably expect a .org site to house a nonprofit, a .edu site to house a college and a .gov site to house a department of the federal government. Many countries even have their own domain name extensions — Brits shopping at Urban Outfitters use the .co.uk version of the site.
But the neighborhoods described above are based on clear, widely recognized categories. Law defines nonprofits and educational institutions; international borders define countries.
Clothing and pornography, though? There are as many definitions as there are people. Online businesses should embrace the variety by sticking to a three-letter domain name that makes no judgments: .com.

Robert Pattinson has donated a private screening of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 to generate funds for Program Advancing Girls’ Education, an organization helping to educate teen girls in Cambodia. The movie will be screened for 20 people in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, the night before the global release.
 The winners of the screening would also be awarded goodies, including signed posters, DVDs and a replica of Bella’s wedding ring.
This screening is in partnership with the Go Campaign, and the generated funds will be used to construct a permanent shelter home for girls in Cambodia. The new house will be able to house 20 girls. PAGE has acquired a large piece of land so as to setup a vegetable garden of their own to feed the students.
Similar to this screening, Pattinson had auctioned an opportunity to meet him on the set of Breaking Dawn under the same campaign last year. The money generated, about $80,000, is being used by PAGE.

While 60 percent of record sales are still based on CD sales, the digital market is definitely the place to go for the current collegiate generation. With services like Apples iTunes and Amazon’s MP3 Store, buying music has never been easier.
At the same time, illegally downloading music could be just as easy, if not easier, than purchasing singles or albums from an online merchant. And where’s the first place to go if someone wanted to download copyrighted material for free?
Google.
There does seem to be an inherent issue with the Internet search engine conglomerate attempting to market its own MP3 music store in the upcoming weeks when it happens to be the biggest weapon against the music industry.
If and when Google does launch its music store to compete with the likes of Spotify, iTunes and Amazon MP3, it plans to use the new social networking tool, Google+, to boost interactivity and profitability in the digital marketplace.
Using Google+, the service hopes to allow for online “likes” or “+1s” to dictate what music consumers should purchase. The input of friends and Internet searches could also affect the buying process and the addition of being able to listen to the song in its entirety one time for free will also reinforce the decision-making process. After a song is purchased, the Google store will allow the new music owner to have a limited ability to share, peer-to-peer, the music that has just been bought.
The store would not charge for online archiving of tracks that you already own, unlike the iTunes equivalent iTunes Match, which will charge $24.99 for a storage service.
This “consumer-first” approach is weakening Google’s ability to get record companies to sign onto the new platform. Companies fear that, with both a peer-to-peer file sharing network and no desire to charge for the online storage service, copyrights could be infringed. They have no intention of losing any more revenue thanks to Google.
The question at hand is: Can Google’s music platform compete with the already established iTunes and Amazon MP3 music stores?

From Thursday, Oct. 20 to Sunday, Oct. 23, the Los Angeles Sports Arena in Exposition Park opened its doors to more than 5,000 needy citizens, serving as the location of one of L.A.’s largest free clinics.
Organized by the LA-based CareNow, an international relief agency, the clinic treated thousands of people who needed help but did not have insurance. A number of nursing students and others from organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Diabetes Association worked with about 800 volunteer doctors, dentists, optometrists and other professionals to ensure proper care was given to every patient.
Many of the patients had not seen a doctor in years, thanks to a lack of sick days or inaccessibility to proper care. With an estimated two million-plus uninsured people living in Los Angeles County, this event is a step in the right direction in terms of public health care.
“It is a cry for help because if we can’t come here, where are we going to go?” Stephanie Fletcher, who had a tooth pulled at the clinic, told Southern California Public Radio. “We need this event here. We need these volunteers. We need these doctors. Because there are a lot of one-income households, and if that person is not healthy and strong, what are the children going to do?”
Many of the low-income citizens of Los Angeles County were directly impacted by the Medi-Cal budget cuts of a few years ago, which caused the company to stop covering dental and vision care. However, the CareNow clinic had a number of dentists and optometrists available for any possible malady.
“As you know, tooth decay and other things, if we don’t take care of that now, it can lead to more severe problems that can affect us later on,” said Fletcher.
The CareNow clinic also arranged for many of its patients to receive follow-up care with local clinics, which will ensure that they receive the ongoing care they require.
