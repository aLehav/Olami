USC’s swimming and diving team is accelerating into a new season, hoping to continue the momentum gained over an impressive summer of competition and welcomes a freshman class that rivals any others in the nation. With the women’s recruiting class ranked No. 1 and the men’s ranked No. 3 in the US, its likely to be a fiercely competitive year for this new group of Trojans.
On the women’s side, Haley Anderson gave USC a thrilling preview of what to expect from her freshman season with her stunning performance at the US World Championships trials. Anderson earned herself a spot on the US World’s team in the 800 freestyle, coming in second place with a personal best 8:26.34.

Anderson went on to compete in Rome, where she took ninth place in the 1500 freestyle, achieving a best time of 16:20.62 and just barely missing out on a spot in the finals.
“For my first international experience I was really happy with my overall performance at Worlds. I definitely learned a lot,” Anderson said.
The success didn’t stop there this summer for the new Women of Troy, with Jordan Danny, Jessica Schmitt and Yumi So all making finals in the US Open, National Championships. Schmitt showed off her moves by making finals in the 100 and 200 individual medley as well as the 200 breaststroke, a versatility that will be vital in dual meets this season.
“This year’s freshmen cover a wide range of disciplines and distances,” said assistant coach Catherine Vogt. “It’s a really well balanced group of women with a lot of depth.”
Joining these bright-eyed freshmen are some ladies with a little more college experience: All-Americans Presley Bard and Lyndsay DePaul both transferred to USC in the spring and are ready to go.
“I’m excited to be a part of the beginning of this young group; this team is only moving forward,” NCAA Top-8 finalist Presley Bard said. “Because this is my fourth year of college, I can help guide the freshmen as well as go through this new experience with them, and I think that’s important.”
DePaul had outstanding success this summer at the World University Games, winning silver in both the 400 individual medley and the 200 freestyle.
“Lyndsay swam extremely fast,” Bard said. “And seeing her do that off Coach Salo’s program has given me great hope.”
Continuing the Olympic tradition of USC’s swimming and diving team, freshmen Christel Simms and diver Ariel Rittenhouse each represented their countries in Beijing in 2008. Simms, a sprint-freestyler from Hawaii, was just the seventh woman to represent the Philippines in the Olympics, finishing 41st in the 100 freestyle and 47th in the 50 freestyle.
Rittenhouse, a long-standing USA National Swimming Team member, is one of the country’s top female divers and finished fourth in 3-meter synchronized swimming in Beijing.
For the men’s team, French national champion and 2008 Olympian Clement Lefert crossed the Atlantic to join the Trojan legacy, after competing at the World Swimming Championships and the European short-course championships. Lefert clocked the second-fastest French time ever in the 200 butterfly at French Open Nationals with a 1:55.05.
British national champion Richard Charlesworth made a similar voyage this January to the sunny shores of Los Angeles, where he has spent the past eight months preparing for his first college season and acclimatizing to the warm weather.
Charlesworth also competed in Rome this summer, representing Great Britain in the 800 and 1500 freestyle and open water events.
“Getting to race in both open water and in a pool was a great experience in Rome, the championships were a fantastic learning experience and I am keen to do it again,” Charlesworth said.
And speaking of talent, Alex Lendrum from Phoenix, one of this year’s top US recruits, decided USC was the place to be. His 400 IM will undoubtedly dominate the Pac-10 and looks to have serious NCAA Top-8 potential.
The team also scored one of the fastest high school sprinters in the country, Morgan Henderson-Kunz, who holds the number one 100-yard freestyle time and the second fastest 50-yard freestyle time for incoming freshmen in the nation this year.
“Morgan will definitely be an impact kid,” said assistant coach Jeremy Kipp. “He’ll bring something to the fight and be a big factor in competition.”
Emmett Walling, the junior college record holder in the 50-yard freestyle and 100-yard breastroke, will further solidify the return of USC’s male sprint program, which is looking to finally silence Pac-10 rivals Cal and Stanford.
California locals Spencer DiDio, Justin DiFederico, Blake Cushing and Pieter Kranenburg all provide immediate help at the Pac-10 level with the potential to make great strides individually.
For the Women of Troy, freshmen Lolo Blair and Lindsay Parrish come to USC as two of the top recruits from Santa Barbara, while freshmen Lili Shiota and Kate Shumway, the Illinois state champion, both come into this season as national qualifiers. Freshman Chelsea Wild from Irvine will be a great asset to the team’s prevailing distance program, and also comes into this program as a national qualifier.
“I’m very excited about the momentum this team has gathered over summer, and I’m excited to ride that momentum and start getting this team back to the top of NCAAs,” said coach Dave Salo.
These freshmen may look young and naïve, but don’t be fooled; this outstanding selection of athletes has the potential to pull USC back to the top. College swimming be prepared: The Trojans are coming.

Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor only averaged 3.6 yards per carry against USC last year, but the sophomore’s running skills are causing a stir headed into this year’s match.
The 6-foot-6 quarterback took over as the Buckeyes’ primary signal-caller last year after splitting snaps with Todd Boeckman in the USC game and led the team to a 8-1 record as a starter. The former blue-chip recruit dazzled fans with his running skills, including a 110-yard performance against Illinois.

With the Buckeyes undergoing an offensive overhaul in the offseason, Pryor has become the focal point of the Ohio State attack.
Much has been made of Pryor’s maturation as a pocket passer this offseason, but the Trojans are still respecting his abilities as a runner.
“He’s doing the right thing, developing and taking pride in becoming an all around complete football player, and he looks like that,” USC coach Pete Carroll said at his weekly press conference. “He’s going to be a great quarterback.”
Dual-threat quarterbacks have given USC trouble in the past, like in 2007 when Oregon quarterback Dennis Dixon ran for 76 yards in a 24-17 Ducks win in Eugene, Ore.
Defensive coaches have emphasized disciplined play and gang tackling as a way to contain Pryor on Saturday.
“It’s kind of frustrating to have to chase down a fast guy like that,” defensive tackle Jurrell Casey said. “But we know we can get him as long as we keep our outside contain. You just can’t let a guy like that get outside.”
Casey and cornerback Kevin Thomas returned to practice Wednesday after sitting out the last two days with the flu. Both are expected to be able to start on Saturday in Columbus.
The 6-foot-1 Casey said he felt “90 percent” healthy and that he was confident he would be at full speed come gametime.
“I’m not completely over it, but I’m good enough to be out here with my teammates,” Casey said.
u
Carroll said Wednesday that USC wouldn’t have as much information on the Ohio State defense because it faced an unorthodox first opponent in Navy, which runs the triple option.
Although the Midshipmen racked up 198 rushing yards and came within a two-point conversion of forcing overtime last Saturday, Carroll noted that their attack was difficult to counter. The Trojans’ pro-style offense is preparing for a few different looks than the ones the Buckeyes displayed last week.
“This one game in particular looking at their defense — it doesn’t help us very much,” Carroll said. “We would think we have a feel for them, but we don’t really know. They could have done some new stuff in the offseason, so we have to be ready to adapt.”
The Buckeyes lost four starters from last year to the NFL, but quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates said there was plenty of talent left on Ohio State’s roster.
“They have five or six guys who are going to make it into the league. They have a lot of speed and a lot of power, so they’re going to be hard to go against,” he said.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.
USC opens up its season with a 50-point romp, beating up a lesser opponent before a supposed “game of the year” the following week against a highly ranked team.
Ohio State stumbles before the “game of the year,” playing down to an inferior opponent and having to hold on for dear life.
If it sounds familiar, you’re thinking of last year. In 2008, the Trojans defeated Virginia, 52-7, while the Buckeyes escaped with a 16-13 win over Ohio.
And how about that “game of the year” the next week? The 2008 USC-OSU game was not much of a game at all: Trojans 35, Buckeyes 3.
This year, the two teams are off to similar starts. USC trounced San Jose State 56-3, while Ohio State needed late-game heroics to hold on against Navy, 31-27.
So what’s to say the result Saturday won’t be the same as last year? Why can’t the Trojans walk into the Horseshoe, drop another 35 on the Buckeyes and walk away big winners again?
There’s the obvious disparity in quarterback experience. Terrelle Pryor was essentially handed the reigns in the middle of last year’s blowout in the Coliseum, getting the bulk of the playing time for the remainder of the season.
The sophomore threw 12 touchdown passes and ran for another six in 2008 while starting all of OSU’s key games down the stretch.
“He understands the game much, much better. I think he knows more of why he’s doing what he’s doing and why we’re doing what we’re doing and why the defense does what they do and all of those things,” Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said Tuesday via telephone.
USC’s signal-caller will be true freshman Matt Barkley who, in case you’ve forgotten, has yet to make a collegiate start on the road or against a ranked opponent.
Then there’s the revenge element. The Buckeyes have to be seething after failing to show up in last year’s contest, and while there’s so much turnover from the ’08 squad, it still has to sting.
And, of course, USC takes its show on the road this time around. The Horseshoe will be packed Saturday night and it’ll be a loud place to play.
“You have to focus in the huddle,” coach Pete Carroll said. “Everybody watches the play caller so you can see his expressions and make the most of the communication. And we have to make our calls.”
But that alone is not enough to make this game close.
Pryor was unimpressive in OSU’s biggest games last year. He threw an interception, was sacked four times and averaged 1.3 yards on 15 rushes in a three-point win at Wisconsin.
He was picked off once and averaged less than a yard per attempt on nine rushes in a 13-6 loss at home against Penn State, which all but ended the Buckeyes’ shot at the national title game.
The Tostitos Fiesta Bowl didn’t go much better; he was 5-13 for 66 yards, with no scores of any kind.
The rest of the team around him is inexperienced as well. James Laurinaitis, Malcolm Jenkins, Chris “Beanie” Wells, Brian Robiskie and Brian Hartline are just a few of the veteran names gone from last year’s roster.
“From a playing standpoint, [Pryor is] kind of a veteran. That’s a little bit daunting for a young person that young to be the guy with the most experience,” Tressel said.
He added: “We lost some real good ones from the defense, but hopefully this young bunch will get old faster.”
Yes, USC’s defense also suffered tremendous turnover. A new corps of linebackers will start at the Horseshoe Saturday. The defensive line has new faces. But even Tressel recognizes the group’s tremendous talent.
“If you took the jersey numbers off the guys and just had them out there without numbers, you’d think you were watching last year’s film,” Tressel said. “Again, they know exactly what they’re doing, why they’re doing it, the way to do it.”
USC’s ground game remains potent, with junior Joe McKnight looking rejuvenated, redshirt junior Allen Bradford stronger than ever, senior Stafon Johnson in top shape and redshirt junior CJ Gable a force as well.
And Barkley?
He doesn’t need to be the hero Saturday. He needs to hand the football off, make the easy throws and let the offense carry him — not the other way around. If he can do that, his inexperience won’t be a factor.
Don’t forget — if Carroll didn’t think Barkley was capable of winning these games, then he wouldn’t be starting.
So what does this mean come Saturday?
It means the chips are in place for another not-so-close game. 35-3? Probably not. But a comfortable, double-digit point win? A likely outcome.

Any conversation about the 2009 Ohio State football team has to begin and end not with coach Jim Tressel’s sweater vest, but supremely talented quarterback Terrelle Pryor. The 2008 No. 1 recruit in the country, Pryor boasts a skill set that already has NFL executives drooling.
“He’s a great player. He’s a focal point guy. You can’t watch [Ohio State] and not watch him,” coach Pete Carroll said during his weekly press conference.
Game changer · The Trojans’ gameplan will be centered on stopping elusive Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor, who has improved from 2008. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
Dual-threat quarterbacks like Dennis Dixon and Vince Young have given the USC defense fits in the past with their scrambling ability, and Pryor has more raw talent than either of them.
“I’ve always said that the most difficult aspect of defending an opponent is when they have a quarterback that can run and run on plays that aren’t designed to be quarterback running plays,” Carroll said.
Pryor himself played well last season against USC in relief of starting quarterback Todd Boeckman. While the lead-footed Boeckman was hopeless in the face of the Trojans’ pass rush, Pryor completed seven of nine passes for 52 yards and added another 40 yards on the ground. With another year of seasoning he should provide a stiff challenge for the revamped Trojans defense.
The 6-foot-6, 235-pound Pryor is more than just an agile pair of legs, however. The sophomore spent so much time this summer working on his passing that he developed tendonitis in his right arm. His arm, since healed and improved, could help Pryor emerge this year as one of the nation’s best quarterbacks.
“This is a very, very unusual athlete to be this tall and this fast and have a great arm,” Carroll said. “I think you’ll see he’s not just a runner.”
Here is a brief primer on some of the other names USC should be wary of this weekend.
Daniel “Boom” Herron, Soph. RB, 5-foot-10, 193 lbs. and Brandon Saine, Jr. RB, 6-foot-1, 217 lbs.
Running backs Daniel “Boom” Herron and Brandon Saine have the unenviable task of trying to replace Chris “Beanie” Wells, who left a year early for the NFL. The duo combined for 125 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries last week for the Buckeyes.
Last season, Herron and Saine were largely ineffective against USC in place of the injured Wells, gaining just 61 yards on 13 carries. Ohio State needs to get more production from their running game outside of Pryor to take pressure off of the quarterback.
Brian Rolle, Jr. LB, 5-11, 221lbs.
Linebacker Brian Rolle racked up nine tackles including a tackle for loss last weekend against Navy, but it was his interception late in the game that thrust him to the forefront of the rebuilding Ohio State defense. Rolle stepped in front of a pass on a two-point conversion attempt and returned it the other way 99 yards for two points, preserving the Buckeyes victory and likely saving their season.
If last week’s six-touchdown performance is any indication, the Trojans plan to ease quarterback Matt Barkley along while relying on the ground game. With three-time All-American linebacker James Laurinaitis gone, it will be up to Rolle and the other new starting linebackers to slow down USC’s stable of running backs.
“The [linebackers] are real active. They run sideline to sideline. They’re just new players like our guys are,” Carroll said. “But, like our guys, they’re very athletic, and they can do all the same stuff. It’s just a matter of them gaining experience and all.”
Thaddeus Gibson, Jr. DE, 6-foot-2, 240 lbs.
Defensive end Thaddeus Gibson is the best NFL talent Ohio State has on that side of the ball and will be counted on to get pressure on Barkley and the USC passing game. Gibson does not have great size or strength for his position, but he combines shifty moves with excellent speed around the edge.
USC’s offensive line was dominant last week against an outclassed opponent and will need to be so again this weekend. The return of center Kristofer O’Dowd, the unit’s anchor, should help the line protect Barkley, but they will need to be on their game to keep Gibson out of the backfield. If he can make Barkley uncomfortable in the pocket, the Buckeyes’ chances in the game improve drastically.

Tucked in the far eastern reaches of Los Angeles County, behind a water reserve, golf course and park, lies an expansive parking lot. To park here you’ll have to shell out somewhere in between $10 and $25. Why? Because it’s the LA County Fair.
A tradition that began in 1922, the LA County Fair boasts the reputation of being the largest fair in the nation.
One month long, the fair offers Angelenos a chance to pay a lot of money to drink beer out of plastic cups and, more importantly, clog their arteries.
Countless families go through the long, slow crawl towards the fairgrounds like a diesel-scented funeral procession, toward carnival games and chocolate-covered bacon. Even at the end of a traditional summer, inner California has absolutely unforgiving, excruciating heat — and Indian fry bread slathered in butter seems to be the only cure.
Upon entering, fairgoers walk by neat rows of tarp-covered concession booths and brightly colored rides; the occasional interior pavilion sponsored by Toyota might offer respite with fans, mist and some quasi-educational, corporate, feel-good show, but most remain sticky and restless as they crawl through the first rows of advertisements.
I had expected, per my kindergarten curriculum, charming mom- and-pop booths with families selling watermelons fresh from the farm and aunties and uncles competing to make the most delicious pumpkin pies.
Instead, Angelenos wade through marketing first to see a replica Mystery Van, courtesy of Scooby Doo! The Mystery Begins.
The progression from cute kitsch to commercial spectacle mirrors the life of the area. LA County grew from an agricultural area to the center for mainstream entertainment in the world, and even innocent practices like an end-of-summer fair aren’t immune from the transition of changing tradition.
Those attracted to the yearly extravaganza compose a dizzying blur of stroller-pushing teenagers, barbed-wire tattoos, chunky highlights and acrylic nails. You know how politicians aim for middle America? Well, welcome to the forgotten middle Los Angeles. And there are droves of them swirling around different booths, entertaining hot tub salesmen as they sniff around for some fried frog legs.
The true tradition behind all the corporate tie-ins, however, is the field of food. Throughout the grounds, there are hundreds of junk food oases in the commercial desert. Sure, there are plenty of brand names selling hot dogs on sticks and even a giant inflatable king of tacos, but the most prominent features divide themselves into two fascinating simple categories: meat and fried.
I don’t eat the former, but I absorbed the burning flesh through osmosis. Every 10 feet stands a mighty shrine to glowing, glistening charred ribs, roasted turkey legs and smoked brisket. Giant, blackened grills held rows and rows of dissected animal chunks waiting for some eager spectator to tear it apart with some hot sauce.
The pictures certainly were encouraging; giant signs with grisly close-ups of dripping burgers looked like off-the-strip Las Vegas smut billboards that advertised both naked ladies and shrimp cocktail buffets on the same graphic.
And, in traditional fair fare, there’s fried stuff.
The chow casualties include dill pickles, fries with marshmallow cream, bread, Twinkies, White Castle burgers, cheese, Oreos and avocados… These brave snacks face the high temperature bubbling oil and go straight into the mouths — and arteries — of gluttonous Angelenos.
Feeling particularly daring, I decided to limit myself to three delights from the garden of evil: garlic fries, avocados and four Oreos.
The garlic fries were a comfortable start; crisp, steaming potatoes smothered in roasted, heady garlic punctuated with lovely salt and fresh green parsley. Ketchup added a welcome, familiar acidity — but it didn’t mask the fear I had for the next two courses.
Next were the Oreos, which, without Crisco and batter, are fine desserts. The fair version looked suspicious: Four eerily round golden brown disks resembling UFOs (unidentified fried objects, if you will) swam in a viscous pool of chocolate sauce, powdered sugar and grease.
Gambling with my gallbladder and cursing my lack of heartburn medicine, I took a bite.
“Beautiful” was the first word I thought of. A flaky, buttery crust gave way to a crumbling corn syrup, melodious center, gooey with heat and hedonism. Each bite was one sin closer to hell.
The avocado was more unholy: The green fruit already lends itself to a rich, creamy texture, but when cut into chunks and made into tempura, it transforms from decadent, refreshing salad topping to sketchy truck stop bar food, which only becomes palatable with a generous squeeze of ranch dressing. I hate ranch dressing, but for some reason, two crimes make delicious.
I don’t think I have the guts, or the seven bucks, to try deep fried dill pickles any time soon, but we’ll see — there’s always next year. It’s a tradition after all.

Crewest Gallery, one of the many stops along the popular Downtown L.A. Art Walk, just opened its door to the youth of Iran with its newest exhibit, From the Streets of Iran: Works on Paper by Urban Artists from Iran. The exhibit highlights themes and images significant to young Iranians through the most unlikely of mediums: graffiti.
Although some might view graffiti as a form of public vandalism, Crewest Gallery values it as an art form. With its unique style, Crewest fits right in with the Art Walk crowd as a perspective art while also standing on its own as a modern and specifically urban creative vehicle. Primarily featuring street artists, the gallery caters to today’s generation, which is epitomized by the unconventional style of works it chooses to display.
Urban design · Downtown Los Angeles’ Crewest Gallery hosts the powerful, politically driven exhibit, From the Streets of Iran: Works on Paper by Urban Artists from Iran. The exhibit, which opens Thursday and runs until Sept. 26,  features works from five young Iranian artists, each with their own distinct style. The works on display all revolve around the message of social justice. - Photos courtesy of Crewest Gallery
In a time when Americans are no strangers to the events occurring in Iran, From the Streets of Iran presents another perspective — this time from the young artists within the country, particularly centered around the Iranian elections held in June.
Just a short while ago, the media was bombarded with images from the Iranian election between Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the conservative president, and Mir Hossein Mousavi, the former prime minister.
After Ahmadinejad’s contested landslide victory, a “green” revolution — the campaign color scheme for Mousavi — took hold of the country. It was a particularly popular buzz topic on social networking sites like Twitter, as avid web users turned their profile pictures green as an attempt to show their support for Mousavi and to highlight the injustice the elections perpetrated. It was a revolution that was truly motivated by Iran’s youth.
Enter the young urban artists from Iran. What better way to protest and reach an audience by tagging, spray painting and using stencil art on the sides of buildings, roads and bridges as their canvases? And though some works were painted before the election, the color green plays a definite role throughout the show.
Though not all the works in the gallery were created after the election, it’s evident Iran’s sudden turn of events was on the artists’ mind.
Right at the entrance, the artwork unfolds easily and themes of social justice, childhood, innocence, humor, despair and anger flow together yet stand separately. At first it is difficult to believe that five different artists, all in their early 20s, contributed to the exhibit. Yet even though each artist employs his own technique, it is the themes emphasized in each artist’s work that comes to define the youth of Iran.
Even though the works range from images of children in Africa to a picture of Che Guevara and Mona Lisa getting married, an important message that runs throughout the various pieces is social justice. Artists used graffiti to depict both the injustices occurring in their Iran and the simple joys that exist in the politically turbulent country. Even though in Iran graffiti is considered a political offense. CK1, one of the artists, was even detained for three days for displaying his art on walls. It is obvious from this showing and others that the objective of peace and social justice is more significant to each artist than anything else.
The artists further demonstrate their versatility by sampling works from other prolific artists, such as Andy Warhol, and photographs. The pieces can be as simple as a word like “hate” written in Farsi or “joyful” with the image of a child’s face colored with a peace sign. They can even be particularly seditious, like the image of a man painting over the image of Mousavi’s face. The works are complex, filled with an emotional depth that is provocative and at times a bit disturbing with its unabashed honesty.
Unlike other forms of protest or even artwork in Iran, the works of MAD, FRZ, ICY, CK1 and SOT are messages available to the public as a whole, even though the artists are under constant threat for displaying them. From the Streets of Iran expresses the importance of what the youth have to say in an art form that belongs specifically to their generation.
From the Streets of Iran: Works on Paper by Urban Artists from Iran will run from Sept. 10 to the 26 at the Crewest Gallery. The gallery is open Tuesday through Sunday. Visit www.crewest.com for more information.

Museum of Neon Art
Neon. It’s the flush in Vegas’ seedy cheek and the demo of atomic excitability in your 100-level science class. It’s the buzzing vacancy sign at a no-tell motel and the ghostly luminescence of industrialism. If you’re like most people, neon does not mean art; yet what better to shed light on the spectrum of human emotions and impressions than with a medium that draws us like moths from the dark?
Photo courtesy of Esotouric
The Museum of Neon Art begs the same question in this month’s Art Walk. Co-founded by Lili Lakich (with an autobiography dubbed Neon Lovers Glow In The Dark) and Richard Jenkins in 1981 as a non-profit outpost of this radiant work, MONA has flickered through three venues but still blazes on. Neon marquees from Hollywood’s golden era, modern abstract pieces and “kinetic art” rotate through the gallery every six months; others hang around for good. All this electricity crackles behind the museum’s glowing mascot, “Mona,” who declares herself to Downtown, a lurid sketch of Leonardo’s infamous portrait.
Neon is very much alive and well — in fact, production classes are offered to kindergarten-through university-level students at MONA — but like all art, breakthrough technologies and styles threaten to overshadow fading fads. Laboring to power Los Angeles’ vintage charm, the museum has revved up the LUMENS project, which seeks to reinstall and rekindle original neon signs under the curative oversight of current director Kim Koga.
Every Art Walk is stimulating, but it’s safe to say September’s iteration will literally be electric.

The Hippodrome
The Downtown Art Walk’s main inter-event transportation is a spray-painted former school bus packed with live performances, book readings and art talks called the Hippodrome. Always packed and always free, the Hippodrome — the only bus in town with a set list of acts — stops on request and wherever you flag it down. Operated by LA’s under-the-radar bus-adventure company Esotouric — whose owner runs the entire Art Walk—the Hippodrome’s entertainment schedule reads like a twisted children’s birthday party. This month’s on-board offerings were curated by the Ukelady — a woman who sings cutesy songs on the native Hawaiian instrument — and includes performances from Lucas Gonze, Dick ’N’ Jane and Accordian player Anna Holmer. The Hippodrome shuttle circles Spring and Main Streets from 6-10 p.m., trolling for Art Walk goers who need a ride. And if you plan on catching a specific performer’s set, make sure to catch the bus early.

Walking Tours
When Richard Schave took over management of the Downtown Art Walk in July, he implemented a monthly series of free walking tours hosted by a quirky cast of local guides who give tours as unique as their personalities. Downtown chiropractor Dr. Boris Mayzels shows off the buildings and streets his family helped shape; Ed Rosenthal — the broker with an artist’s heart — explores his most-loved historic core hideaways; Mike the PoeT conducts his hour-long tour entirely in freestyle spoken word prose; and Crimebo the Clown trash talks gentrification while waving a decapitated doll on a stick. Even Schave conducts an informative tour, going over the non-profit event’s purpose and how it fits into the Core’s fascinating history. This month’s tours leave famous Clifton’s Cafeteria in 15-minute intervals starting at 6 p.m. With four different ways to experience the Art Walk, first timers and veterans alike are sure to get a new perspective on Downtown culture.

Iran was front and center in the news this summer. The aftermath of the June 12 national elections put the Islamic Republic’s dismal human rights practices in the international spotlight. Prior to the election debacle, when most Americans thought of Iran they were reminded of the anti-Semitic speeches by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the government’s nuclear ambitions, its duplicitous and destabilizing machinations in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East, and its use of oil as a coercive geopolitical bargaining chip.
The aforementioned features of the Islamic Republic’s foreign policy are unacceptable and dangerous, and have been scrutinized extensively by Western media and governments. But until the recent farce of an election and the subsequent outburst of protest on the part of a beleaguered and stifled Iranian populace, the theocracy’s domestic persecutions and injustices were not examined and brought to light to a sufficient degree by the outside world.
Now, the world has seen the cruelty, barbarism and backwardness of a regime that has a distinguished record of paranoia, mismanagement, hypocrisy and corruption. Since the revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979, one group in particular has borne the brunt of the regime’s prejudice and hostility. As the largest religious minority in Iran, numbering some 300,000 people, the Baha’i group members in Iran have suffered a disproportionate share of the scapegoating that has become a hallmark of the Islamic Republic.
According to the regime, the Baha’is — whose core beliefs include noninvolvement in politics, respect for one’s government, a commitment to the elimination of all forms of prejudice, equality for women and men and the oneness of God — are spies for Israel, the United States and Britain. The regime claims the Baha’is are campaigning for the downfall of the Iranian government and the moral fiber of the Iranian public. Each of these claims is not only patently false and fabricated, but outrageous considering what the Baha’i faith stands for.
Prior to the 1979 revolution, the Baha’is formed a significant proportion of the professional class (far higher than the less than 1 percent of the general population indicated) and made lasting contributions to the progress of the Iranian nation.
Then, in a bout of bigoted and ignorant fury, the Islamic revolutionaries and extremists who formed the current regime launched a devastating and systematic persecution of the innocent Baha’i community. More than 200 prominent Baha’is were executed, thousands more were imprisoned and tortured without due process and tens of thousands were fired from their jobs or had their pensions suspended.
To this day, Baha’is are not allowed to pursue a university education and some are expelled from high school. The Iranian Baha’i community, both nationally and locally, is not allowed to hold meetings, commemorate Baha’i holidays, own or rent Baha’i centers or have any sort of organized administrative structure. Perhaps most devastating, dozens of priceless Baha’i historical sites, properties and shrines have been destroyed and taken by the government since 1979. Essentially, the regime has systematically attempted to destroy the historical and cultural roots of the Baha’i community.
Encouragingly, the international community and individual national governments, led by the UN General Assembly, the US Congress and the British Parliament, have issued numerous resolutions and condemnations of the Iranian government’s persecution of the Baha’is and other religious minorities, expressing “deep concern at serious human rights violations” in Iran.
Until June’s “election” and the chaotic aftermath, the Baha’is, along with Israel and America, had served as the convenient scapegoats for Iran’s pressing domestic problems — including anemic economic growth, high drug addiction and prostitution rates, income inequality and socioeconomic stratification. Now that there is a critical mass of people in Iran who are demanding accountability and freedom of thought from its government, it is extremely difficult for the leadership within the Islamic Republic to distract the general population by blaming the Baha’is and the United States for the internal upheavals fracturing the country.
That, however, won’t stop them from trying. Currently, the seven-member group (five men and two women) known as the “Friends in Iran,” who unofficially helped administer the affairs of the Iranian Baha’i community, have been held for well over a year in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison; their trial has been postponed multiple times.
Because of the unprecedented attention given to Iran’s human rights record in the post-election period, American and European news organizations are finally paying due attention to this absurdity masquerading as legal process.
The events of this summer amply illustrated that the extremists running Iran are not only a threat to other countries in the Middle East and beyond, but that they are also a constant and pernicious insult to their own people. They have relegated a nation — with a rich history and civilization, tremendous oil and mineral wealth, and the most educated and entrepreneurial population in the entire region — to international and economic isolation, economic and social stagnation, and a toxic trauma to the national psyche as a result of their Orwellian rule.
In the end, however, as history has demonstrated countless times, tyrants and authoritarians are eventually vanquished and discarded. So while persecution of Iranian Baha’is and other helpless citizens continues unabated, I tell my brothers and sisters in Iran to hang in there, know that there are millions of people around the world who are pulling for them and, most importantly, to always remember that injustice is unsustainable.

A 21st century philosopher once mused: Fall is here, hear the yell/ back to school, ring the bell/ brand new shoes, walking blues/climb the fence, book and pens/ I can tell that we are gonna be friends.
Yes, as another Labor Day has come and gone, it is once again time for most little Trojans-in-training to head back to their schools, in the midst of the state’s dire financial flux. School districts across the cash-strapped state of California are opting to find alternative ways to try to compensate the bits of their budget that were terminated by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
With approximately $17.7 billion cut from the education budget over the past two fiscal years, the schools we’re counting on to educate the business leaders and wunderkind economists of the future are laying off teachers left and right. The result is rising class sizes and fewer extracurricular activities — an interesting strategy to say the least.
Needless to say, the conditions present in the pauper-esque educational system are not very conducive to optimal education at all, let alone future prosperity.
So in the current economic climate, the onus of trying to right this ship falls squarely on the sun-baked shoulders of the school districts.
Taking a page straight out of the seedy book of professional sports, many are exploring the option of marketing and branding their schools.
Some schools in San Diego, for instance, are in talks to give away naming rights to dorms and dining halls in exchange for additional revenue. In the same vein, Beverly Hills High School is looking to launch a clothing line bearing the school’s crest.
Assignment one: Define selling out.
Perhaps it’s a little unfair to label the above actions as such. Fundraising on steroids seems more apt. But there is still something very un-kosher about this merging between the corporate world and the impressionable young minds of the state.
Imagine spending your first kindergarten lunch chowing down on your crustless peanut butter and jelly in the Procter & Gamble cafeteria.
Somewhere, Jack White is foaming at the mouth.
But supposing such measures are implemented (which seems likely), maybe it won’t be the worst thing that could happen. In fact, perhaps the future leaders of the world will be much better served by the harsh experiences gained on this accelerated course plan in the proverbial school of hard knocks.
Assignment two: Define capitalism.
Forget sharing. Greed is good.
Throwing out the age old values that have been instilled in grade school classrooms for the past couple of generations, students will learn that if you’ve got it, you should flaunt it.
With multiple school districts fighting for money across California, there’s potential for ruthless battles between school districts fighting for the same sponsors, especially when it means the difference between keeping quality teachers and sinking even further into mediocrity.
Assignment three: Define desperation.
HELP!
Whereas many schools across the nation utilize partnerships with large corporations, professional sports franchises and the like, it seems schools hardest hit by the budget cuts will be reaching out to such resources not to supplement, but rather to replace their extracurricular programs.
While there is no downside to such a partnership, there is something wrong with children being deprived of such opportunities in the event that an arrangement can not be worked out.
Further, many school systems are asking for donations from the families themselves, effectively bringing public schools into private school territory, but without the same benefits.
And though officials assure the public that any and all efforts to try to market individual schools will be tasteful, the skeptics would argue that the districts are “pimping” their schools for money. When it comes down to fighting for those extra dollars, who’s to say that there won’t be a compromise in integrity somewhere down the road?
Assignment four: Define survival of the (financially) fittest.
Already it’s apparent that school districts in more affluent areas of the state will be much better off than their low-income counterparts, with large private donations helping to offset the budget shortfall.
With nothing to help promote parity across the state’s school districts, there will only be a greater gap to fill between the upper and lower classes — perpetuating some of the same problems in the busted economic status quo.
Under this system, it appears the quality of education will be solely based on how well individual schools can market themselves.
Fair. Just like most of the dodgeball games that take place on the hallowed playgrounds across the nation.
Sadly, there’s no use in pointing fingers in this unfortunate situation. The state budget crisis saw casualties across every important component of the public sector. With the future appearing dreary for the foreseeable future, there is no alternative to the current situation, no convenient circuit breaker to restart the overloaded economy. And surely, the peanut gallery might be overreacting to what seems to be a lucrative and logical choice for struggling schools that would not get their funding elsewhere.
But the biggest problem is that the worry-free lifestyle associated with the formative years of education will be lost in this intermingling of business and schooling. It will be hard for students not to constantly worry whether or not the school district will be able to sell enough hats to furnish a school play or if the homecoming football game can take place on the school’s home field-cum-IMAX-theater.
The first week of school: sponsored by uncertainty.
Here’s to hoping that this crop of fundraising ideas serves its purpose without overstepping its boundaries.
Kids. They grow up so fast.

Groundbreaking on the USC Catholic Center — scheduled to begin this month — has been pushed back to early 2010 because of delays in obtaining building permits from the city.
Plans for building a new Catholic Center, including a 25,000-square foot church at 32nd and Hoover streets, began six years ago. The current Catholic Center, which was inaugurated in 1958, will be torn down and its services moved to a temporary location near campus once groundbreaking begins.

“These things take longer than you think,” said Father Lawrence Seyer, the pastor of the USC Catholic Center. “In order to move up in the phase, you need to make sure the previous process is completed.”
Executive Director of the Catholic Center Clare Faulkner said about one-third of USC students are Catholic, which was one of the reasons they wanted to build a newer, bigger center.
“Our board is committed to building a place for all students to gather and have another place for service, socializing and to practice their faith,” she said.
With the delay in construction, the new center is now set to open in 2011.
“The approval process takes time,” Faulkner said. “We were optimistic about the timeline and found the reality — that it is going to be pushed back.”
The new Catholic Center, open to everyone, will include classrooms, a library, meeting rooms, a chapel, a media room and a student union.
“We were making do with our current facility but we have really outgrown our capacity,” said Anthony Heim, the campus minister and associate director of the Catholic Center. “This project is coming at a right time for us as our community continues to grow. It is a much-needed project.”
While waiting for the permits to be approved, the Catholic Center is still finding funding for the $35-million project.
“We are continuing our fundraising effort,” Faulkner said. “We have raised close to $28 million but are looking for alumni, parents and friends who want to help raise the remaining.”
The money raised so far has come from USC alumni, foundations, parents and friends of the university. Students familiar with the center are excited for the new building to be constructed.
“It is nice to know our facilities will get bigger and better and provide a place for students to participate,” said Oswaldo Rivera-Ortiz, a graduate student studying architecture and a worker at the Catholic Center.
Rivera-Ortiz is only disappointed that he won’t be at USC when the center opens.
“I work here so I know how much everyone is working hard to make this happen,” Rivera-Ortiz said. “I’m just disappointed that it’s taking long because I would have wanted to see it ready in my time here — it looks like a good place for students.”
The new church and center will continue to provide mass, dinners, homeless ministry and various social activities.
“Our mission is to produce a home away from home for students to make friends, practice their faith and serve others,” Faulkner said.
Heim also believes the new site will be more prominent.
“Students will see what we offer in a new light and provide a greater visibility,” Heim said.

But five years later, Jordan was contacted by the City of Hope cancer center and told she was a possible match for a woman with acute myeloid leukemia. Jordan decided to donate. One year later, she met the woman who had received her marrow, Rhonda Christensen, and was immediately welcomed into the family.
“I could tell she was a caring, kind person,” Christensen said. “Without Elizabeth, I wouldn’t be here. She’s a part of the family; it’s like we adopted her.”
Now, the two are a hosting a bone marrow drive at USC, hoping to save more lives and spark more lifelong relationships. The drive which will take place on Trousdale Parkway from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Friday near Tommy Trojan.
Christensen has hosted drives twice before, but for Jordan, this is her first. She said she is excited to bring a bone marrow drive to USC.
“It’s my new passion, educating everyone,” Jordan said. “Particularly college students. It’s been the greatest gift I’ve ever given or received. It’s been so magical, and I want people to know that.”
Though Jordan’s case is rare — donors and their recipients seldom meet, and almost never do they become as close as Jordan and Christensen — Jordan can think of many other reasons students should participate in the drive.
Jordan stressed not only the simplicity of joining the registry, but of the entire donation process. By filling out a simple health questionnaire and having their cheek swabbed, people can join the bone marrow registry, which is all that will be done at USC’s drive this Friday.
Donors must be 18 to 60 years old and in generally good health with plans on remaining committed to being in the registry. After the swab, potential donors are entered into a database that searches for possible genetic matches, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few decades.
“With the advances in technology, it’s as easy as having an IV in one arm and the other,” said Pablo Ortiz De Urbina, a senior majoring in music performance and a volunteer for this week’s drive. “It takes so little of your time; it’s three hours that saves a life.”
Jordan said she is concerned potential donors may be scared away by the myths associated with bone marrow transplants, since many people believe the procedure is more painful than it is.  According to the National Marrow Donor Program’s website, one form of donating marrow uses anesthesia, however, so the donor feels nothing. The other form is a non-surgical, outpatient procedure that is as easy as donating blood. Pieces of bone are not removed and though there may be a short recovery time, there are rarely any long-term effects from donating.
“Talking to Rhonda and hearing from a recipient’s point of view, talking to someone who’s been so brave, who has survived such an ordeal, just to hear it, it’s really powerful,” Jordan said.
She also encourages people of different ethnicities to join the bone marrow registry. Of the patients who have received transplants, an overwhelming majority are white. Because close genetic matches are needed, it’s important that all people, especially people who are black, Hispanic or Asian, join the registry.
The drive will be sponsored by Be the Match, City of Hope’s national marrow donor program. A Facebook group named “Join the Marrow Registry at USC” has also been created to promote the event.

USC’s Undergraduate Student Government is taking a page out of C-SPAN’s book.
Striving for greater transparency, USG has decided to film its weekly Senate meetings and post them for viewing on its website.
“Not many people go to these meetings, so people can at least get a feel of what the Senate is about and what they do,” said David Ji, deputy director of technology for USG.
Tuesday’s Senate meeting was the first to be videotaped, but USG officials are currently in the process of resolving technical and logistical issues related to filming and don’t expect the video to be available until Friday, Ji said. As filming procedures become more streamlined, the videos should appear online one to two days after each meeting, he added.
Residential Senator Wilson Kyi, who spearheaded the project along with Ji and USG Vice President Ashlie Chan, said he hopes the convenience of watching the videos online will give students incentive to take an interest in the work USG does.
“We thought that having our actual meeting videotaped would increase the transparency for how our decisions are made,” Kyi said.
The project began when Kyi and other senators spoke to students who said that they weren’t able to attend meetings because of scheduling conflicts. That discussion was then made official business at USG meetings last semester, but the actual process was only set up a week ago, Kyi said.
Chan said she recognizes the Senate meetings will not interest everyone, but hopes the videos will allow students to feel more connected to their student representatives.
“There’s only so many people in our organization, so we need that feedback from students,” Chan said. “If it changes one person’s attitude toward USG, if they want to know more about what USG’s doing, then it’s worth it.”
Kyi added that no portion of student money was being used to fund the project, since Ji already had all of the equipment necessary to film the meetings.
USG senators will email their constituencies to inform them about the videos and they plan to publicize the service when visiting various student assemblies and organizations on campus, Kyi said.
Some students said they were excited about having the chance to watch the Senate meetings online and anticipated becoming more knowledgeable about USG through these videos.
“I would be really interested to watch it. I think it’s important to know what’s going on because if they are making decisions, we often don’t know about it,” said Natalie Torkan, a senior majoring in business administration.
Michael Doherty, a senior majoring in communication, said he thinks the videos will allow USG to make students more aware of pressing campus issues they may not have known about otherwise.
“I’d watch it. I’d like to know what’s going on,” he said. “I personally wasn’t even aware you could attend the meetings, so [the videos] will make for more viewers who are more informed.”
But other students, like Jennifer Esfandi, a senior majoring in psychology, said the videos alone may not be enough to convince students to attend the Senate meetings or to take notice of USG’s work.
“I think it’d make [the meeting] more accessible on the one hand,” she said. “But I don’t think I would watch them, and the people who would watch them would probably go to the meetings anyway if they cared.”
While he knows the videos may not reach every student at USC, Kyi said he believes USG has a responsibility to make the option available to students who want to take advantage of it.
“I don’t plan that the majority of the students will watch the whole meeting, but I do think that students who are interested will watch it. Maybe they’ll want to watch it for a decision that just happened or for something controversial that may happen in the future, so it’s great to have this resource,” Kyi said. “As long as there are students who want to see our meetings, we want to provide that service for them.”
