During my senior year in high school, I was one of the sports editors of the campus paper. There were four of us; we had an issue only about every two months, and we typically only had four to five pages to fill.
Now nearly three months into my gig as a sports editor at the Daily Trojan, I can look back at those days and laugh. Instead of four editors, there are just two. Instead of bi-monthly issues, our paper is on the racks every Monday through Friday. Sports typically has up to four pages each day.
What I’m trying to say is I essentially do the equivalent of what four people achieved in two months at my high school paper in a single day, two to three days a week (my co-editor Hailey and I switch off days in the office).
The absurdity of that accomplishment is never lost on me every time I walk out of the office with a finished sports section and place the proofs in my editor-in-chief’s box.
Somehow though, I feel more stable and in control at the Daily Trojan, despite the hectic day-to-day operations of producing a daily newspaper — the scramble to fill space, the stress that comes with writers not turning in stories, the 8 p.m. basketball games that brush right up against deadline, the devastating spelling or grammar errors that aren’t caught and printed for the world to see.
Yet, I would take this job over my high school paper in a heartbeat.
Producing four to five pages every two months was somehow a bigger struggle than having just a day to do it. Writers wouldn’t turn articles in on time, despite having weeks to come up with a draft. And despite having several months, it always seemed like it was a race against the clock for us editors to find photos, finish captions and update stories. The fact that none of us really knew how to use InDesign didn’t help either. Somewhere in my inbox are piles of concerned emails from the newspaper moderator basically wondering what the hell is going on with the sports section. Those are fun to go back and read from time to time.
The biggest plus to working at an independent campus paper, though, is exactly that — the independence. I love the freedom to be objective and criticize when necessary. My high school paper was strictly censored by the administration. Every story had a positive spin. When a team played poorly or negative news broke about an athlete, we simply wouldn’t run a story. It was as much public relations as it was journalism.
By no means am I disparaging my high school paper — I worked with good people, and it was an excellent learning experience. I probably wouldn’t be here today if it hadn’t been for the (rough) introduction to newspaper production.
Wednesday night, I left the office around 11:30 p.m., having finished a five-page sports section that included a story I had written on the fly during production, another that came in late and a last-second photo addition. In all, there were seven stories and five photos.
Of course, what I thought about as I walked out with proofs in hand was that I accomplished all of that in six and half hours. If you had told me that that was possible as a high school senior, I would have straight up laughed.

Hubbard Street 2, the second company of one of the world’s top contemporary dance companies, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, performed March 23 at Bovard Auditorium. Hosted by Visions and Voices and the USC Kaufman School of Dance, the event had a large turnout from the public and vibrant dance community at USC.
Founded by Julie Nakagawa and Lou Conte in 1997, HS2 is now in its 19th season. Currently led by Director Terence Marling, HS2 “prepares early-career dancers in contemporary dance, and identifies next-generation choreographers,” according to the program. Aside from performing at renowned venues in the United States such as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and Joyce SoHo, HS2 has also appeared in Germany, Luxembourg, South Africa, Switzerland and other places around the world. After their time in the company, HS2’s talented dancers go on to join Hubbard Street’s main company, or other top dance companies worldwide.
The company performed four pieces, each of which were stunning and unique. The first piece, “Hello,” featured the ensemble, consisting of three female and three male dancers. A quiet dance track was accompanied by a male narrator, who first introduced each dancer individually and then narrated their movements. The simplicity of the piece, marked by a “this is … ” narration structure, the costumes consisting of nude underwear, and the fresh-faced women with slicked-back buns, accentuated the dancers’ pure beauty. The dancers’ simple and clean movement, though similar to one another, showcased their individual personalities through their artistic choices.
“Long Story Short,” choreographed by Ihsan Rustem, introduced the audience to the “liquid velvet” movement of HS2, as Jodie Gates, vice dean of the Kaufman School of Dance, puts it. The base track features a heavy beat and is repeatedly accompanied by a woman speaking work commands in German and by a man reciting “Howl” by Allen Ginsberg. This soundtrack, coupled with the ensemble’s seamless dancing takes the audience through their three stage journey of “insecurity and immense doubt, the urge to break free, then absolute calm,” as Rustem explained.
“Changed In Its Affection,” choreographed by Bryan Arias, is a lighthearted piece that serves to end the show on an uplifting note. Dressed in identical backwards suits, the dancers question their uniform identity through their witty movement. In a striking moment of the piece, all six of the dancers stand in a line and make ridiculous faces and movement — outstretching their faces and flailing their arms — as if mocking themselves. Then a featured dancer, Adrienne Lipson, hurled herself across the line of dancers in a rambunctious fashion. The manifestation of the business suit, made a remark on the gender hierarchy, which the dancers were viciously trying to oppose by proving that they’re identical, yet they still fought against their identities.
After the showing, Terence Marling and the company dancers participated in a Q&A session with Gates. The personable dancers shared their advice for aspiring dancers, particularly the BFA dance majors at USC.
“Stay curious,” said Elliot Hammans, HS2 dancer advised. “I like to think of my job as  an adance scientist or researcher. Every story has an idea or some presence to it. Make yourself a thinking dancer.”
One audience member asked what socks they wore, which was a very important question to ask, since it’s difficult to dance on marley with slippery socks. Their secret to not slipping — wearing Dockers, 100 percent cotton socks (the higher the cotton the better).
Later in the evening, Adrienne Lipson, who is in her second year with HS2, spoke about what inspires her to continue perfecting her craft.
“Most often [what inspires me] is those that I’m dancing with. In performance, I love exploring different relationships on stage with my fellow dancers, sometimes connecting them to real life and other times inventing situations or a history with someone that fits the specific world and context of each piece.”
Lipson’s message aligns with the unity created between the dancers throughout each piece. Dance, although marked by the ability to be an individual artist, also relies heavily on the connection between dancers, which serves as a vital source for growth.
