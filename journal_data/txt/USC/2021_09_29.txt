Former USC swimmer and five-time Olympic medalist Klete Keller pleaded guilty to a felony count of obstruction of an official proceeding Wednesday for taking part in the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot. 
Keller agreed to a plea bargain after facing seven federal charges, including knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building, participating in disorderly conduct in the Capitol building and impeding law enforcement, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The former Trojan swimmer, who won three NCAA titles at USC from 2001-2002 and graduated in 2009 with degrees in public policy and real estate development, was indicted Jan. 6 after wearing his Olympic jacket to the riot and was captured in videos clashing with policemen inside the Capitol Rotunda. 
According to the New York Times, Keller said in his plea deal he was in the Capitol for approximately an hour, screaming curses at Democratic leaders, taking pictures and videos and “jerking his elbows” at law enforcement. Afterward, the New York Times reported Keller got rid of the Olympic jacket he wore at the riot. 
Keller was charged Jan. 13 and turned himself in to law enforcement in Denver the day after, according to the Los Angeles Times. He deleted his social media accounts, which were supposedly full of pro-Trump messaging surrounding the capitol invasion. 
The felony he was charged with, obstruction of an official court proceeding, usually carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. However federal sentencing guidelines dictate that, for an offense charged at this level, the sentence will likely range from 21 to 27 months; the judge is not bound by that range, though.  
The Daily Trojan reached out to USC for a statement, but the University declined to comment.
Keller won bronze and silver medals in the 2000 Olympics, gold and bronze in the 2004 Olympics and gold in the 2008 Olympics. 
In 2004, Keller swam the final lap of a gold medal-winning relay effort with U.S. stars Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte.
Back in January, USA Swimming released a statement on the matter.
“It is very simple and very clear. Mr. Keller’s actions in no way represent the values or mission of USA Swimming. And while once a swimmer at the highest levels of our sport — representing the country and democracy he so willfully attacked — Mr. Keller has not been a member of this organization since 2008,” the statement said.
In addition to the NCAA titles with USC, Keller won multiple Pac-12 conference titles, including back-to-back victories in the 200-yard freestyle in 2001 and 2002.
Keller struggled after leaving swimming in 2008, getting divorced, experiencing a child custody battle and briefly dealing with homelessness, according to the Washington Post. Friends knew of his conservative beliefs, love of guns and support of Trump, The Post reported, but were still surprised by his role in the riots. 
Keller’s lawyer Edward B. MacMahon Jr. did not respond to a voicemail left by the Daily Trojan in time for publication.

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed improving course accessibility and student mental health at the Senate meeting Tuesday. 
The initiative, titled the Absence Notification Project and a collaboration with USG Vice President Lucy Warren and other senators, aims to alleviate the pressure on students as they adjust to in-person classes amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
“It’s a project that streamlines a good, consistent way for students in the case of an emergency to contact their professors all at once,” said Sen. Hana Li, one of the senators involved in the project. “A lot of times, it’s really overwhelming to go and reach out and have to email each professor separately.” 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan following the meeting, Li said one of the project’s proposals would take the onus off students to report absences by creating a centralized system for both professors and USC to access. 
“Another reason that we want to implement this is just for the use of wellness days,” Li said. “If lots of students are missing a certain week or class, and there are a lot of absences, they can compile that data to see that we need a wellness day.” 
Li is also pushing to train instructors and faculty to attend training for online formats and increase access to hybrid courses, citing students’ struggles with shifting to an in-person format and issues with accessibility. 
“[It would] allow professors to be more accommodating with absences and sickness and emergencies, since we still are in this pandemic,” Li said. “A lot of people are having a really hard time transitioning.” 
Additionally, Li is working on a project that will deal with the disparate resources offered by USC orientations to transfer and spring admit students as opposed to freshmen admitted in the fall.
“I’m actually a transfer student myself, and one of the reasons I actually ran was because I realized that the resources offered to fall admits and transfer admits and spring admits was wildly different,” Li said. “The reason I ran to begin with was just a way to make campus more of a welcoming space.”
Li said she hopes to create more opportunities for students to feel welcome on campus and make sure that the entire student body feels included, starting with an upcoming meeting with the Office of Orientation.
USG President Alexis Areias also presented updates, including a project to find potential workstudy alternatives for undocumented students since they’re not eligible for federal funding.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Areias said that, while the project is in its early stages, Provost Charles Zukoski seemed perceptive to the idea. 
“UC Berkeley has a great program — we’re looking into modelling or installing some sort of fellowship program,” Areias said. 
Areias has also been working with Trojan Awareness Combatting Overdose, a new organization created this semester to increase overdose awareness on campus and equip student organizations, such as Panhellenic sororities, with Naloxone, a medication that treats opioid overdoses in emergency situations. She hopes to spread awareness to other registered student organizations in the future and increase access to equipment. 
The Senate confirmed Holly McCauley, a senior majoring in English literature, as chair of the accessibility affairs committee. McCauley formerly served as the co-executive director for the Student Assembly for Accessibility and a member of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council and the USG Accessibility Committee, she will lead the accessibility affairs committee in their projects for the remainder of the year.

Hundreds of LAC+USC Hospital resident physicians walked out of work Tuesday to protest for a new contract with Los Angeles County that includes increased pay and improved benefits. L.A. County has thus far refused to negotiate a new contract, according to a Committee of Interns and Residents press release.
Residents and doctors said they want new contracts that raise housing subsidies to compete with nearby programs. 
Wearing scrubs, whitecoats and holding signs that read “Support LA County Resident Physicians,” protesters lined up on the stairs outside LAC+USC as residents, doctors and local politicians such as California Sen. María Elena Durazo and Assemblymember Miguel Santiago delivered speeches, praising residents’ work during the pandemic and supporting their protests.
“You have saved the lives of our communities while you put your own lives and your own families at risk,” Santiago said. “So what we’re asking here today is not a whole heck of a lot. What we’re asking here today is just a simple contract that says, ‘We appreciate your work.’”
LAC+USC, located near the Health Sciences Campus and one of the largest hospitals in the nation, is affiliated with the Keck School of Medicine and owned by L.A. County.
Dr. Adam Freeman, a delegate on the bargaining committee who spoke at the protest, said LAC+USC needs to attract physicians who are dedicated to serving the community.
 “We need to increase our economic compensation in terms of benefits and salaries so we can bring those visitors over,” said Freeman in an interview with the Daily Trojan following the protest. “There’s a lot of other L.A hospitals that have similar patient populations, but they have better [salaries] and benefits. 
Dr. Max Yang, an internist in internal medicine at LAC+USC, said, “every residency program in [Southern California] has a housing subsidy, and they can be upward of $10,000 … We’re trying to at least get parity with those competing programs in the area.”
According to Freeman, L.A. County has declined to increase coverage of “living or housing,” citing finance limitations and will instead extend the current contract six months.  
Los Angeles City Controller Ron Galperin, who spoke at the event, said the County “[has] those resources” for residents, and it has an “obligation on the part of our county to look out for you the way that you have looked out for everybody and are doing so each and every single day.”
“I’m all for saving money, but you save money on the right things, not the wrong things,” Galperin said.
Internal medicine internist Dr. Pratik Doshi said a weaker contract will lead to worse hospital care. 
“If you don’t have great residents coming here, then you don’t get great doctors who are [going to] stay here to become faculty members and take care of these patients long term,” Doshi said. “This is kind of an institutional issue where, if you don’t fix it now, it causes long-term problems.”
During the protest, speakers emphasized the extra work residents dealt with as a result of the pandemic, including long hours, risking contracting coronavirus and comforting sick patients whose family could not enter the hospital.
“Every one of us has a residency and fellowship programs impacted by this pandemic, even at times foregoing educational and training opportunities to assist you in times of COVID surges,” Freeman said. “We avoided family to prevent exposing them [to coronavirus] and initiated our own [personal protective equipment] drive to ensure the hospital never ran out of equipment.”
When Durazo spoke, she led residents in chanting “Bargain now! No more delays!” — the shouts directed at the County. Durazo also spoke about the disparate impact the coronavirus has on Black, Indigenous and people of color, asserting the need for “the best doctors” in the community around LAC+USC and the County’s responsibility to give back to the residents for their work in the community.
“We must be there and stand with you. This is all for the health and wellness of our communities, especially our most impacted, and especially our poorest communities,” Durazo said. “Every single person deserves the best health care.”
At the end of his speech, Freeman reaffirmed the residents’ commitment to receive a new contract.
“We pay over $200,000 in educational debt, we don’t qualify for overtime or comprehensive retirement benefits, we work an average of 80 hours a week,” he said. “Our response to the county is that we didn’t roll over for the pandemic, and we aren’t going to roll over now.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, LAC+USC said that CIR labor negotiations occur at the LA County CEO’s office. 
“In support of our mission, LA County Health Services provides extraordinary care in our community with compassion and respect. This could not be done without our workforce members who deliver best-in-class care,” the statement read. “We want to thank our workforce members for their heroic efforts throughout the pandemic and as we move towards a better normal.” 
A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote by  Dr. Pratik Doshi to Dr. Blake Adnani. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

USC will mandate influenza vaccinations for the second year in a row amid the upcoming flu season, Student Health announced in a campuswide email Tuesday. Students, faculty and staff must receive and submit proof of vaccination by Nov 1. 
All students who live in University-owned housing or take in-person classes must present proof of influenza vaccination by submitting their immunization record to the MySHR portal. However, students who both reside in off-campus residences and take classes remotely are not subject to the mandate but remain strongly encouraged to be inoculated against influenza. 
“This requirement will help mitigate the potential simultaneous impact of flu and COVID-19 during the seasonal flu time frame in the fall [and] winter months,” Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman wrote in the memo. “Exact timing of flu season may vary, but activity often begins to increase in October [and] typically peaks between December and February.”  
According to the announcement, the flu shot will be enforced by the Trojan Check wellness assessment. USC Student Health is also prepared to ensure broad vaccine access for all students to complete their shot by the Nov. 1 deadline, Van Orman said in a student media briefing Tuesday. 
“We’re going to have flu shots at all the testing sites,” Van Orman said. “We’re hoping most people will get their flu shot when they come [for their coronavirus] test -— so you don’t need an appointment for that.”
While flu vaccines will be available at all USC-sponsored testing sites, Van Orman said students are welcome to receive their shot at outside pharmaceutical retail stores. The CVS located inside USC Village Target provides free flu vaccines to students through scheduled and walk-in appointments.
Of the 34,161 tests administered last week, 47 students and three employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The 0.18% positivity rate among students declined steadily since the beginning of the fall semester. Similarly, the staff positivity rate stands at 0.24% — a decline from the 0.3% reported last week. 
Van Orman said she is encouraged by consistent declines in positivity rates on campus, low coronavirus prevalence throughout the greater Los Angeles community and high vaccination rates. Despite feeling “positive” about the current coronavirus climate on campus, Van Orman said mitigation efforts such as masking and weekly surveillance testing are likely to stay for the foreseeable future. 
“We have been discussing the [weekly testing] — I think we’re going to continue with the testing for the time being,” Van Orman said. “Interestingly, we have a lot of feedback from students, faculty and staff that they like the testing –– it helps makes them feel [secure].” 
Despite positive feedback toward ongoing mitigation efforts, the “no guest” policy — a coronavirus USC housing guideline that restricts student visitors from entering residential facilities — continues to draw criticism from students.
In a student health briefing Aug. 26, Van Orman said the “no-guest policy” was a directive from the Los Angeles County Health Department, not a University regulation. However, in a statement to the Daily Trojan, a public relations spokesperson for the department said no policy of that nature is actively in effect.
“The [no-guest policy] is no longer in effect and was superseded by new IHE guidance a couple of months ago,” the spokesperson wrote. “There is no current DPH order or recommendation stating that students should not visit other student’s residences.”
During Tuesday’s student health briefing, Van Orman clarified that local health orders do not require the University to implement a no-guest policy but the Centers of Disease and Prevention guidance for higher education that recommends the practice. Van Orman said the no-guest policy is under active reconsideration.
“We are looking at [the no-guest policy] — we have a meeting coming up this week to reevaluate it,” Orman said. “If we continue to see cases drop, then that is something we’re in the process of looking at.”
According to Angie Ghanem-Uzqueda, the epidemiologist for Student Health, 85% of reported coronavirus cases are among students. Citing robust and frequent testing, Uzqueda said undergraduate students makeup the vast majority of cases seen on the USC campus. Of the positive cases on campus, 60% are undergraduate students, 30% graduate students and the remaining 10% other groups outside of the student body. 
“This is partially a result of testing — a lot of our graduate students right now are still not coming to campus,” Uzqueda said. 
Last week, a Centers for Disease and Prevention Advisory Panel approved booster shots for Americans aged 65 and older, adults with underlying conditions and workers in high-risk settings. Van Orman said Student Health is willing to discuss booster shots with student workers who seek one based on their individual risk. However, USC health officials emphasized an interest in abiding with current federal recommendations for those eligible to receive a booster shot. 
“We are not necessarily going to be restricting people’s access [to the booster shot],” Van Orman said. “I would say for the average student-employee who’s only kind of risk factor is that they work at a University — they are not necessarily someone I would consider to be at higher risk.”

Amid the in-between-class hustle and bustle of Trousdale Parkway Tuesday, two members of VoteSC stood on a ledge near the Center for International and Public Affairs holding cardinal and gold pom poms. 
“Register to vote to get free ice cream,” members yelled, leading students to the organization’s table on the side of the walkway. 
The event was in honor of National Voter Registration Day, which takes place annually on the fourth Tuesday of September. VoteSC, the Center for Political Future and the Undergraduate Student Government, took part in a joint effort.
Upon arriving at the table, students scanned a QR code that led to a Google Form, which acted as a pledge to vote in upcoming elections. If the student had not already registered to vote, the form also provided a link to VoteSC’s website, which lists instructions of the process. Once the student signed the pledge, a member of VoteSC staff gave them a sticker, which they could exchange for free ice cream provided by Coolhaus. 
About 30 minutes after the start of the event, a line formed at the Coolhaus ice cream truck long enough to wrap around the corner of Trousdale and Childs Way. The flock of people at the intersection attracted more students to the event. 
“[The event] is very attention grabbing,” said Lily Perry, a senior majoring in computer science, while waiting for the ice cream. “It’s in a good spot on campus, and people notice the long line.”
Christian Burks, a senior majoring in public policy and co-president of VoteSC, said the organizers’ expected a turnout of about 200 students.
“I’ve been very pleasantly surprised because this was our first in-person event in a while, and it’s a non-election year,” Burks said. “I think people don’t have the same energy and activism and passion for voting, but I guess the ice cream doesn’t hurt.”
Besides the gubernatorial recall election earlier this month, no state-wide or national elections are upcoming this year. Even though 2021 is not an election-packed year, Burks stressed the importance of keeping students energized about political engagement. 
“I think it’s important that we keep doing events like this, even in non-election years, just to build a culture and infrastructure on voting on campus, not just one that comes and goes every two years when there’s an election,” Burks said. 
Attendee Chantal Corona, a freshman majoring in health and human sciences, recognized that political involvement events are helpful for student engagement in California’s governmental scene. 
“[These events] are important because it at least gets the community and the students talking and knowing that registration is important,” Corona said. “Getting involved in politics and voting, at least for the state of California, it’s helpful and it’s knowledgeable.”
VoteSC events such as National Voter Registration Day, were previously held online since last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Burks said the virtual events were “fulfilling but not as fulfilling as they could be.” 
“[Being in-person] is very relieving because this kind of reminds you why you do the work that you do,” he said. “This is something that makes me really feel good.”

There is nothing like a midterm to knock me off my high horse. As I go from office hour to office hour, I’m forced to recognize the importance of fundamentals. If you don’t practice them from time to time, your entire knowledge about the field will fall apart (one look at my grades should serve as enough proof of that).
All this to say: I’m going back to the basics.
That’s right: no business theory, no content trends nor anything of the sorts. Just pure, simple esports.
And what better place to start than the most recent Smash Ultimate Summit tournament? 
Those who watched it will know exactly why I’ve decided to talk about it. After all, it was unique in so many ways. 
It had the largest prize pool out of any Smash tournament to date; players were chosen based on popular vote and it had a series of crowdfunding goals set out during the initial campaign.
But I’m not here to talk about any of that. Instead, I’ll be focusing on one particular esports team that made its debut in this tournament and, if successful, might reshape the future of the industry.
Of course, I’m talking about Moist Esports. 
I know that it sounds a bit … off-kilter. But the team is named after its creator: Charles “MoistCr1TiKal” White Jr., a famous Twitch streamer and Youtuber. 
According to a video he released on his channel, White was approached by pro Super Smash Bros. Ultimate player Kolawole “Kola” Aideyan. Initially, Aideyan asked for White’s help to gather enough votes and join the tournament. White told Aideyan he’d like to do more than just that, and asked if he would also be willing to join his brand-new esports team. Aideyan said yes and — ta-da! — Moist Esports was born. 
At first glance, this origin story doesn’t seem too interesting. After all, it’s just a streamer starting an esports team. But think about it for a second.
A streamer started their own esports team.
That is almost unprecedented in the history of esports as a whole. While content creators have certainly signed contracts with organizations before, almost none of them have bypassed the threshold and gotten full rein over the team. White, by starting his organization from scratch, not only has put that issue to rest but is also constantly paving the way for future streamers to follow his lead. 
But should they? Why is a streamer running an esports team beneficial in the first place?
Well, I can’t say that it will always be. Regardless of how you feel about them, esports executives usually run the company for a reason. You need someone with experience with the corporate world to make the entire operation viable. Still, Moist Esports has shown that there are some benefits to having a popular content creator running the team. 
First of all, since the streamer has a large following, the team can save loads of money in marketing and overall publicity. As long as the streamer reminds their audience and showcases the team’s content on their broadcast, thousands of people will see it. 
A great practical example of these benefit is the boost Aideyan received in votes after he signed into the team, which allowed him to participate in the tournament. 
Secondly, if a popular content creator runs the team, this means that their main source of revenue does not come from the athletes they sign. Thus, the organization has a lot less incentive to take a higher percentage of their athletes’ prizes. 
In Moist Esports’ case, they do not take any amount from the players’ earnings; all the money an athlete receives from a tournament is theirs to keep. It doesn’t take a genius to understand why many pro-gamers, especially those who play games with relatively lower winnings, would be interested in that.
Naturally, this sort of setup is not viable for every single context. If you plan on becoming a huge esports team that has international reach and plays a plethora of games, you’re likely better off having an executive as a CEO. 
Still, thanks to Moist Esports, there is now an alternative path toward professional gaming that should be attractive to many athletes out there. Of course, its influence in the esports world depends on its overall success. 
Only time will tell whether the team goes down in history as a trailblazer or some failed experiment. But as things currently stand, I can not help but echo the words of the team’s founder so well repeated throughout the internet:
“Woo Yeah Baby! That’s what I’ve been waiting for.”

The women’s volleyball team cruised to a solid 3-1 victory over the University of California, Berkeley on the road Sunday. USC won in three sets, with the final score eclipsing 25-21, 25-21, 18-25, 25-9. The Trojans now sit at 5-6 overall and are 1-1 against Pac-12 opponents. With conference play in full swing, here are the five most important games to look forward to as the season unfolds for USC.
Away at Washington State University on Oct. 1
The Trojans will travel to Pullman, Wash. Friday for what will be their first true conference road test of the season. Washington State started off their season 0-4, but, since then, they have won eight straight games, including two huge victories against in-conference opponents No. 24 University of Colorado Boulder and No. 6 University of Washington. 
The Cougars swept the Buffaloes and then defeated their in-state archrival in five sets. This team is surging and has a ton of momentum, and it will be a big challenge for head coach Brad Keller and his team to get the victory on the road. If the Trojans succeed, however, it would be the team’s biggest win so far and could spark a turning point in the season.
At home versus No. 19 University of Utah on Oct. 8
The Utes are another team who boast a victory against Washington, defeating them in five sets Sept. 22. They also defeated No. 3 Nebraska before conference play Sept. 11. 
However, their latest game was a loss against No. 24 Colorado in straight sets, dropping their record to 8-3. The Trojans haven’t beat the Utes since 2017, but this home game will be a great opportunity to break that ugly streak. 
At home versus No. 13 University of Washington on Oct. 29
Washington started off the season ranked No. 4 in the AVCA poll, but have lost their last two matches to Utah and Washington State, both in five sets. Their other defeat this season came to No. 8 Ohio State University on Aug. 28. 
Despite these tough losses, the Huskies still rank No. 13 in the country with a respectable 7-3 record. Junior outside hitter Claire Hoffman has been terrific for Washington so far this season and leads the team in kills with 117. 
Away at No. 11 University of Oregon on Nov. 12
Sitting at No. 11, Oregon is currently the highest ranked Pac-12 team , making them the team to beat in the conference. Oregon has started this season 11-1, with their only loss against No. 13 Minnesota. 
Star setter Elise Ferreira and outside hitter/libero Brooke Nuneviller have fueled the Ducks. Ferreira has tallied a whopping 290 assists, and Nuneviller has posted 132 kills — both of which are team highs. Last season, USC lost back-to-back heartbreaking five set matches against Oregon. On Nov. 12, the Trojans will have a chance to get their revenge in Eugene. 
At home versus No. 15 UCLA on Nov. 26
The Trojans will close out the regular season in a heated rivalry matchup against the Bruins. Every game against UCLA is important, but this one looks to be especially tough. UCLA started off their season with an impressive 9-1 record, and have strung together a five game win streak that includes a four-set victory over USC last Wednesday. 
The Bruins’ only loss this season has come to the University of San Diego, a school that also beat USC and now ranks No. 25 in the country. Last year, USC’s late-season victory over UCLA sparked a four game win streak, and, for Keller’s sake, hopefully history will repeatitself.
Honorable mentions:
Away versus No. 24 University of Colorado Nov. 5
The Buffs finally cracked the Top 25 and have only posted one loss so far this season to surging Washington State. As always, the altitude in Colorado will present a difficult challenge for the Trojans. Graduate student outside hitter Leah Clayton leads Colorado with 173 kills through 11 games, and a 33.3 kill percentage — third best on the team. 
USC, though, is 20-1 all-time against Colorado, including 11-0 at home.
At home versus no. 17 Stanford on Nov. 24
The Cardinal are currently 6-4, but all of their losses have come against quality opponents: No. 1 Texas, No. 7 Minnesota, defending National Champion No. 6 Kentucky, and No. 15 UCLA. They will be a dangerous Pac-12 rival.

Sept. 15 through Oct. 15 is Latinx heritage month, a time where the 33 countries of Latin America are celebrated for their rich culture and contributions to society. However, the panethnic term “Latinx” has often fallen short of its purpose. “Latinx” has not captured Latin America’s diversity properly because the scope of Latinx representation has been far too narrow in our media. 
In a study conducted by USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, researchers analyzed 200 Hollywood films between 2017 and 2018 to understand how Latinx people were depicted on screen. They found that Latinx people were commonly depicted without much association to their ethnic background. This means they were portrayed as is, without explanation or visual representation of their cultural background. Additionally, more than half of Latinx characters were depicted as being involved in illegal activities, which further advances the harmful stereotypes attached to the Latinx community. 
Latinx representation doesn’t do enough to advance our culture when the representation doesn’t go beyond the larger label of Latinx. I am a Latino, but beyond that I am also from Honduras, a Central American country. When movies and other forms of media do not accurately portray the specific culture of a Latinx country, they consequently promote the erasure and false appearance of Latinidad as a monolith. 
This is reflected in the conversations I have with both non-Latinx and Latinx people. It is very rare for me to meet someone who knows about Honduras’ location, let alone our cultural practices. Many Latinx people from countries in South America and other parts of Central America also experience this. 
Eliseo Martinez sells fruit on the corner of Hoover and 32nd street, right across from USC Village. He is from the state of Oaxaca in Mexico, which has deep Indigenous roots. However, the traditions of this southwestern Mexican state are often overlooked. 
Martinez said, in order to fix this issue, we can highlight Oaxacan traditions, such as teaching others about the several Indigenous languages spoken in the state and the typical dishes of Oaxacan people. 
Replicating this idea with different Latinx countries isn’t a far-fetched idea. In fact, this month is the perfect opportunity to do it. According to USC, about 15% of the student population is “Hispanic/Latinx” as of Fall 2020. We could come together to highlight our ethnic backgrounds in order to widen the breadth the term encompasses. 
“There shouldn’t be a difference because we are all Latinos,” said Martinez in Spanish. “We’re from different countries, but we should always be united.” 
When speaking to other Latinx people about this topic, there seemed to be a recurring desire for unity but also the desire for differentiation. Lorena Huerta, a Mexican woman who lives in my neighborhood, said Latinx is interchangeable with her country of origin, but she believes we should still be specific when we talk about a Latinx person. For example, instead of saying “the Latinx person,” we should refer to the person by their country of origin. 
Fidel Carrillo, works in his dad’s carniceria inside of Lee’s Liquors Store on 23rd Street. Carrillo is from Mexico City and this month, he noticed a large lack of celebration for a very special date. 
Sept. 16 was Mexico’s Independence Day and although the holiday received ample attention in the media, Carrillo said that Salvador’s Independence Day, which falls on the previous day, was largely ignored. Carrillo said this is the result of media platforms focusing on the countries that are more well known or who make them more money. 
For Carrillo, journalists are a part of the issue because we don’t use our position to promote the cultures of the smaller or “unknown” Latinx countries. This is a call to my fellow journalists to be more conscious about how they represent Latinx people in articles. We need to be aware of the small ways in which we can help further the diversification of the Latinx label to make not only ourselves, but also others more culturally aware and inclusive of Latinx people. 
The University can play a large role in pushing this movement forward. For example, when accounting for the composition of the student population, it would be more beneficial to collect statistics that separate the Latinx population by ethnicity. As a result, Latinx organizations on campus can have a better understanding of how they can improve the way they serve the Latinx student population. 
It is Latinx Heritage Month, but besides the banners along Trousdale Parkway, the University has done very little to promote Latinidad and engage students to participate in festivities. Although we are living through a pandemic, USC could consider opening the campus to Latinx food vendors. Students would then be able to see the range of Latinx culture through our food. It is important to observe culture, but tasting and physically feeling it stretches beyond the limits of language.
It is a lackluster month of celebration for many Latinx people like me who feel as though their countries are underrepresented in the media. It is a month where we are reminded we are invisible. We can change that through more intentional representation — not just this month, but every month.

I have the utmost admiration for those who can find a pair of perfectly distressed Levi’s from a thrift store or repurpose an ugly old T-shirt into something wearable. I’ve always wanted my style to be as cool and creative as the Depop girlies — as the kids say these days — but, sadly, my fashion IQ is equivalent to the amount of sleep I’ve been getting this semester — zero. 
The secondhand apparel industry is rapidly rising and estimated to be worth about $64 billion in 2024. Independent consignment resale — through both stores and Depop shops — is also expected to increase significantly. As people become more environmentally and socially conscious, secondhand buying could cause the slow and steady decline of the fast fashion industry. 
From the fancy upcycled thrift stores on Melrose to YouTube thrifting hauls, the digital world popularized the practice of shopping for used statement pieces. As brick and mortar stores and malls ride the downward trend, social media has picked up the slack, inspiring countless users to get creative with their own vintage finds and obscure band T-shirts.
Of Depop’s 30 million users, approximately 90% are aged 26 and under. At first glance, the growing used clothing trend is an unequivocally sustainable choice. 
However, the novelty of flipping through someone else’s closet has its downsides. Due to the increased demand in thrifting, prices and scarcity of basic items grew, which affects those who might not have the means to shop elsewhere. 
Thrifting contains a cognitive dissonance that needs to be addressed. It’s fantastic that the stigma around thrifting has changed and that more people are interested in purchasing used clothing — it’s an opportunity to find uncommon, sustainable and durable pieces. However, as physical and virtual shops curate their inventory for the latest Gen-Z obsession, thrifting strays further away from its intended purpose — an affordable option for those in need — and more toward an exclusive, aesthetic experience such as the Melrose Trading Post. 
I’m all for straying away from international corporate brands that churn out identical crop tops and mom jeans, but new thrifters are wearing the right clothes for the wrong reasons. Middle and upper classes’ gentrification of thrifting makes it inaccessible to those who have no alternatives. Translating excessive overconsumption from the new to the old, Depop resellers and thrift flippers are exponentially multiplying as they sift through donations at local thrift shops in the hopes of turning a profit. 
Thrifting has been touted as the end of fast fashion, but the toxic combination of capitalistic competition and social media trends have created an insatiable demand for both new and used clothing . As we change the ways we consume apparel, thrift stores change, too. In fact, recent trends show that thrift stores are seeing an influx of donations of cheaply-made, trendy pieces. 
All of these convoluted pros and cons make an already-unenthusiastic shopper, such as me, never want to purchase anything again. However, the nuances of thrifting and its alternatives beg the question: Is there ever such a thing as ethical consumption in our undeniably capitalistic society? 
I’d argue that there’s not — conscientious consumption is quite literally exhausting. Sometimes, it’s just so much easier not to think at all. Ultimately, we all need to make a living and wear clothes on our backs. Although their money goes to good use, thrift stores still profit off whoever patronizes them. 
Although still a step toward saving money, better consumption habits and snazzier style, thrifting over fast fashion is not always a simple, black and white solution. Regardless of where you shop, it’s worth taking the time to be a more thoughtful consumer. Analyze the frequency and cost of your own consumption habits, consider the durability of your favorite brands and pieces of clothing and inform yourself about your favorite stores’ manufacturing and labor processes. Most importantly, reevaluate your own actions.
In the fashion industry, the only way to reduce environmental impact is to simply buy less from less environmentally damaging sources. Continually buying cheap clothing — while convenient — perpetuates a cycle of overconsumption and strains our limited material resources and maxed-out environment. Although comparatively better, the same goes for thrifting: Maybe the carbon impact of your purchases is significantly less, but it’s still unnecessary to walk away from a thrift store laden with an entirely new wardrobe. 
For environmental and social progress to be made, the overall attitude toward fashion in our society needs to change. We have to look beyond trends and understand thrifting’s importance, both as a sustainable choice and legitimate option for lower-income communities. Clothes themselves should be regarded as less disposable, and until our social media — and consequently, shopping — habits take a greener turn, it will be impossible to truly escape the hold of trendy, fleeting fast fashion.

Though “Crazy in Love” is their debut full-length studio album, ITZY has experienced the spotlight since their inception in February 2019. After their monumental debut singles “Dalla Dalla” and “Icy,” the group maintains its future house and bass influences while incorporating more trap and hip-hop inspired production elements. The result is a strong crop of confident anthems and joyous tracks that further refine their sound.
JYP Entertainment formed ITZY as the label’s first new girl group since 2015. JYP is one of the “Big 3” labels in the K-pop industry, with other giant groups such as TWICE and 2PM rounding out JYP’s ranks.
Members of ITZY Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong and Yuna were all heavily trained as vocalists, dancers and rappers up until their 2019 debut. That professionalism has shined in the group’s excellent execution of their artistic pursuits. From vibrant visuals for the album’s lead single “LOCO” to their flawless performance of the track on “The Kelly Clarkson Show”  last Wednesday, ITZY continues to set the bar high for every facet of their work.
The choice of “LOCO” as the lead single shows the group’s musical savvy; the track’s latin-inspired beat and infectious post-chorus make it endlessly replayable, a quality which garnered the song’s music video over 50 million views on Youtube. Thematically, it establishes the focus on love and confidence through a Gen-Z perspective that guides the album. On the track, Lia sings of “going crazy, up and down” in a relationship, feeling she’s “outta control” amid the group’s quirky production.
ITZY find a resolution to that confusion in “SWIPE,” where they allude to rejecting unhealthy relationships in their lives as if on a dating app. Over electronic-pop production, the girls celebrate their power to walk away from toxic partners, encouraging their fans to feel similarly empowered to “Swipe, swipe, swipe / Yeah, to the next.” Fans and critics will be pleased to hear ITZY continues to imbue their music with liberating messages, a practice they have sustained since their first single “Dalla Dalla” (which literally translates from Korean to “Different Different”), an anthem for confident individuality.
There are a number of tracks on the record which offer a wonderfully cute experience. The hook of “Sooo LUCKY,” “I want to know the world that I’m lucky, lucky, lucky,” is an affirmation of thankfulness from Yeji and Chaeryeong. With their impassioned vocals and energetic beats, the back-to-back tracks of “LOVE is” and “Chillin’ Chillin’” deliver a similarly potent shot of dopamine directly to the listener through their cheerful tone and lighthearted subject matter.
Fans of all genres often fear their favorite groups will grow more generic in their full-length debuts, but ITZY effectively holds onto their idiosyncratic noise on “Crazy in Love,” most noticeably in “#Twenty” and “B[OO]M-BOXX.” The latter is a heartfelt, albeit a touch unstructured, homage to their early work, complete with a more homemade sound and left-field production. The former, is likely the weakest song on the tracklist, with an unenthusiastic repetition of “Twenty, twenty, ooh, ooh” taking up most of the chorus.
As the album progresses, the disparity in quality between the A- and B-sides that we might expect seems to be slight, if present at all. Rather, tracks such as “Gas Me Up” continue to weave both the sonic and topical threads of the first four. Even if the lyrics stray from the track’s topical focus at the beginning of a couplet, ITZY manages to center their focus on the cool self-assurance they have always provided: “Well it’s accurate like one plus one equals two / No changing, I do what I do.”
Though “Crazy in Love” serves as a continuation of ITZY’s work, its final track is something new: a pop ballad. It’s a choice that listeners likely won’t expect, and it provides a captivating respite from the album’s preceding up tempo boldness. The spare instrumentation on “Mirror” clears rare space for the group’s masterful vocalists to dazzle, and when the production does flutter, it’s in the form of light percussion or sweet synth strings. It’s not a masterpiece, but its sincerity and uniqueness within the ITZY discography make it a must listen — and provide the album with a lovely concluding reflection on its themes.
“Crazy in Love” accomplishes what K-pop fans have come to expect from a group’s solid debut album; it expounds upon ITZY’s singles and EPs, solidifying their sound and further exploring the themes common in their work. That being said, this album shows little development of the eccentricity and noise which many of ITZY’s fans were drawn to upon their introduction. Rather, some of the choices the group makes in their full-length debut lean more generic. The work has been treated with exceptional care and polished to a shine, but in the rapidly evolving K-pop industry, groups must be careful to hold tight to what makes them special.

After a year away from campus, USC’s improv groups returned to their old routines and added new members to their troupes. Auditions, held Sept. 11 through 13, gave students the opportunity to try out for a spot for one of the four on-campus troupes: The Merry Men, Second Nature, Commedus Interruptus and Spoiler Alert. 
Over the weekend, each troupe held a two-hour audition followed by callbacks. Students were allowed to try out for as many of the groups as they wished, meaning an entire weekend of improv for those interested in all four. The audition process was a collaborative one; at the end of the weekend, all the troupes came together to make final decisions on who fits best on their team. Devin Harris, a sophomore majoring in theatre, auditioned for three groups and got into Second Nature. 
“The joke is, that during auditions and callbacks, it’s like the only time the troupes ‘fight’ … But then, as soon as that’s over, it’s just like we’re all friends who do improv together, and we just happen to be on other teams,” Harris said. “Come see our show, we’ll come see your show, let’s do fun things.” 
Unlike other clubs on campus, The Merry Men, Second Nature, Commedus Interruptus and Spoiler Alert are comprised of approximately 10 members, making the community extremely tight-knit. 
“Each team has somewhere between like five and 10 members, so there’s probably like 30ish people who are on the improv teams and that’s also like a nice little community … We’re all friends, we all do stuff together,” said Second Nature member Jonathan Krone, a senior majoring in narrative studies.
Due to last year’s shift to a virtual environment, most groups  — except Spoiler Alert, who continued virtual shows and auditions — did not take any new members last year. 
“Auditions [are] always really exciting because bringing new people and new energy just energizes the troupe and makes us excited to get to know people and improvise with them,” said Bebe Katsenes, a junior majoring in theatre and a member of Spoiler Alert.  “[Our] troupe is very close and so it’s kind of … nerve-wracking to bring new people into the fold, but it’s very exciting.”
Katsenes said she didn’t fully comprehend what she was “getting herself into” when she joined Spoiler Alert as a freshman. However, she considers the group a family.
“I didn’t realize I wasn’t just choosing a group, I wasn’t just auditioning for a group of people who do improv once a week together, I was joining a family,” Katsenes said. “They are my home base and that’s what’s so exciting and also nerve-wracking about bringing new people, but it’s been really great.”
Right now, the troupes are working to get the “newbies” accustomed to their comedy-styles and skits before incorporating them into their shows. Nico Fife, a senior majoring in theatre and a member of The Merry Men, said the troupe welcomed four new members this fall. During practices, returning members explain the rules of one of the games that they typically perform, play a few rounds and then let the newcomers try it out themselves. Afterward, older members will answer questions and give notes.
“We don’t necessarily need them to be perfect in any way, because none of us are perfect, no matter how long we’ve been on the troupe,” Fife said. “Everyone comes in with their own comedic ability and skill and from auditions, we know that they’re funny and they mesh with us, but it’s like, ‘What’s your slice of the pie [so] we know you knock  out of the park every time, and how do we bring that out of you?’”
Even as teams work hard to prepare these new members for upcoming shows, the environment still seems light, Harris said, matching the familial energy audiences see at their shows. 
“This is so much more about people who are friends doing improv together … which is really cool because, [at] the practices, I was like ‘OK we’re going here to work and do stuff,’ and we do do that, but at the same time it’s just cool people hanging out [and] making jokes,” Harris said.
Even though their newest members might still be practicing, the four troupes are finally starting their post-pandemic debuts. The first show for The Merry Men will be Oct. 11 at 10 p.m. at the Zumberge Hall of Science, and their Halloween spectacular murder mystery will take place Oct. 25. Spoiler Alert has begun their weekly shows at Tommy’s Place, every Tuesday at 10 p.m. Show updates for Second Nature and Commedus Interruptus can be found on their Instagrams. 
Without an in-person audience, Krone said improv groups not only lose audience participation, but also other physical aspects of comedy that are virtually impossible online when members do not perform together in a shared space. 
Now that members and audiences have reunited, the University’s improv groups are ready to once again connect with students. 
“I’m excited to see not only those people who used to come pre-COVID,” Fife said. “But the new people who are going to start coming now and to get a new group of people in our close circle of improvisers and audience members.”
