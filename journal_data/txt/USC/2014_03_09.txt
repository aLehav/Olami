There is nothing quite like March Madness. It starts with conference tournaments that guarantee automatic berths and ends with one shining moment after the new champion is crowned. The electric atmosphere is intoxicating for every college basketball fan, as brackets are inevitably busted and a surprise mid-major makes a Cinderella run.

No matter whom you root for, March Madness is an exciting time. From scrutinizing the matchups to researching the sixth man of a No. 12 seed, everyone is striving for a perfect bracket. This year the stakes are elevated, going from competitive bragging rights with friends to a possible billion-dollar prize from Warren Buffett.
While March Madness is always exciting, it is a heightened experience when USC makes the tournament. Unfortunately, the last few Trojan teams have not come anywhere near the Big Dance. Barring a truly historic run of epic proportions in the Pac-12 tournament this week, it looks like this year’s squad will be spectators as well.
It’s a shame for the Trojan faithful because the most exhilarating March moments for USC have come when the team has made waves in the conference and NCAA tournaments. While it may seem like ancient history now, USC enjoyed a successful run from 2007-2011, earning a berth in four out of those five years.
Those years were replete with exciting moments. The 2007 unit reached the Pac-10 championship game and used that momentum to carry them forward to blowout victories over Arkansas and a Kevin Durant-led Texas in the Big Dance. The 2009 team’s run was equally thrilling. Coming back from a double-digit deficit in the second half of the conference tournament championship against James Harden and the rest of the Arizona State Sun Devils was arguably the most stirring win in recent Trojan history.
It is no secret that almost every perennial powerhouse college program churns out NBA players annually. So it should come as no shock that the most successful USC teams were stacked with elite talent. A common thread among those Trojan teams was a roster full of players who would eventually go on to make meaningful contributions at the professional level.
Nick Young, Taj Gibson, O.J. Mayo, Demar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are all enjoying lengthy tenures in the NBA. Those players combined with solid college athletes such as Daniel Hackett and Dwight Lewis to form the foundation of all the recent Trojan tournament teams.
Though those former Trojans were good in college, no one could have predicted that all five would flourish professionally. In fact, the five have been so successful that, outside of UCLA, USC has had arguably the best track record of producing pros in the Pac-12 over the last decade. Whether it is USC’s facilities, the coaching or the exposure to intense media scrutiny, basketball players leave college ready to excel at the next level. This is strange because though USC has had moderate success, it pales in comparison to the likes of UCLA, Arizona and, to a lesser degree, Washington.
The Trojans mentioned above weren’t necessarily all stalwarts in college either. Young was an elite scorer with a ton of raw potential, but he was also the player who cost USC dearly with boneheaded plays in close losses to Washington State and UCLA. Though he still hasn’t completely grasped the concept of defense with the Lakers, he is now one of the most lethal one-on-one scorers in the NBA.
Gibson was an imposing interior presence at USC, using his length and timing to disrupt countless shots. In fact, if he hadn’t picked up his fourth foul against North Carolina late in the second half of the 2007 Sweet 16, the Trojans might have beat the heavily favored Tar Heels. Yet he was also a 21-year-old freshman who had attended three different high schools, and projected as a tweener on the NBA level. Now he is playing an integral role for the Chicago Bulls as they continue to defy basketball logic and win games.
Mayo was heralded as a star from the time he was a seventh grader, averaging 20-plus points a game for a varsity basketball team in Kentucky. While he was impressive at USC, his tenure can be summed up by his debut game at Mercer. He scored 32 points but USC lost by 15. His best games rarely coincided with Trojan victories. Though not as successful as others in the 2008 draft class, Mayo has still averaged double-digit scoring every year he has been in the league.
DeRozan was another top recruit for USC. Though he was a physical specimen with incredible leaping ability as a Trojan, his range was severely limited in college. Now he is an NBA all-star. Vucevic was a raw freshman when he came to USC. He developed methodically into a double-double machine by his junior season. Very few predicted he would have a similar level of success professionally, yet his career averages in the NBA are even better than what they were in college.
It’s impossible to say if these are isolated incidents, or evidence of an emerging trend for USC basketball. As a fan, I hope it’s the latter, as head coach Andy Enfield has already displayed a propensity for recruiting top talent. If USC can develop a reputation for having a pipeline to the pros, then March will be even madder going forward.

Following the lead of the USC football team, the No. 5-seeded Women of Troy pulled off the monumental upset of top-seeded and No. 4-ranked Stanford, prevailing 72-68 in the Pac-12 tournament semifinals on Saturday night in Seattle.
A win of such magnitude likely clinches a bid to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2006.
Doing it all · Junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama led the Women of Troy with 19 points and 15 rebounds in Saturday’s victory over No. 4 Stanford. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
“This team has proven their worth, we just beat Stanford,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “I cant even remember the last time we beat Stanford and it feels great, but it really is a tribute to these players and how they have persevered and worked hard all season long.”
It does snap a 14-game losing skid to the Cardinal and puts USC in Sunday night’s championship game with No. 3-seeded Oregon State. A conference title would give the team an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament.
It will be the team’s second-ever appearance in the title game. Their last appearance came in 2009, when the No. 6-seeded Women of Troy were routed by top-seeded Stanford 89-64.
No matter how that game goes, though, this is a victory that will define Cooper-Dyke’s first season as head coach of the program and perhaps indicates USC’s ascendance back into prominence in women’s basketball.
The Women of Troy persevered throughout the game, especially down the stretch, trailing by three when senior forward Cassie Harberts put the team on her back and scored 10 straight points to give USC a 67-60 lead with 1:23 remaining.
“I’ve been working towards this for four years,” Harberts said. “I’ve never seen a team that’s given so much heart and never gave up. Even when they made a run, we knew we were going to come back and win the game.”
Playing like the experienced team they are, Stanford would not go away easily and the game would go down to the wire. A missed three-pointer at the buzzer by Pac-12 Player of the Year Chiney Ogwumike would seal the deal for the Women of Troy and give them the assurance that the Cardinal were not going to win their eighth consecutive Pac-12 championship.
Harberts was a force to be reckoned with in the game’s final minutes and finished the game with 13 points, but USC would be carried throughout the game by the one they call “X” — junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama.
Vaioletama would finish the game with a double-double, consisting of 19 points and 15 rebounds.
“We rebounded the ball when we needed to, executed offensively, we got Cassie started late in the second half and X [Vaioletama] played such a great game,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Junior guard Ariya Crook did her part when her team needed her as well, keeping the Women of Troy in the game in the first half by pouring in 13 points, breaking the 1,000 point barrier for her USC career along the way.
The two teams were leveled at 32 at halftime, but the Women of Troy would jump out to a 10-point lead midway through the second half. A large amount of trips to the free-throw line and the efforts of Ogwumike would disintegrate that USC advantage.
Ogwumike led the Cardinal with 30 points and 21 rebounds, tying the Pac-12’s all-time scoring record in the process.
The ability to play stout defense was an integral part in USC’s success. The Cardinal were held to a season-low 31.9 shooting percentage from the field.
The Women of Troy shot just under 40 percent from the field and an impressive 8-for-16 from the three-point line. Crook and Vaioletama were each responsible for three of those eight from long range.
“It’s just a testament to how hard this team has worked and this team deserves this,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Harberts agreed. “Seeing how much my team has grown over the course of the season,” she said. “We just relied on a lot of people and a lot of people stepped up tonight.”

It was a game that the Trojans wanted desperately to win. Aside from the satisfaction, pride and bragging rights that come with conquering the crosstown rival, a loss to No. 9 UCLA on Sunday would represent the team’s fourth straight.
USC just couldn’t keep up. After several valiant comeback attempts, the Trojans succumbed 6-5, dropping to 8-6 overall.
Valiant effort · USC senior LHP Bob Wheatley went 6.2 strong innings in Sunday’s loss to UCLA, giving up just one unearned run and not earning a decision. Wheatley remains 2-0 in five appearances so far this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“It’s tough, especially against your rival with a packed house and you lose that way…it hurts,” senior third baseman Kevin Swick said.
Dedeaux Field was brimming with fans Sunday, prompting those who couldn’t find seats to facilitate their own standing room only section, which too became quickly crowded. Yet despite the flocks of fans, donning both blue and red, the venue remained silent for five and a half scoreless innings until an explosion off the bat of sophomore shortstop Blake Lacey solicited more noise from the stands.
Lacey livened up the crowd with his soaring RBI-double to left, but the lead would be short-lived. The Trojans couldn’t produce a single shutdown inning.
In the top of the seventh, senior Bob Wheatley departed after an error planted a Bruin at second. Wheatley threw a commanding 6.2 innings in which he allowed only one unearned run. In relief, sophomore Kyle Davis allowed three unearned runs, unable to escape unscathed from a bases-loaded, two-out jam in which the payoff pitch plated two go-head runs.
“We made two errors Friday and two today and today it really cost us,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “Today we just didn’t play catch. There’s no doubt this hurts because in my opinion, that should’ve been a 4-1 win for us, maybe 5-1.”
Still trailing in the bottom of the eighth, the Trojans were gifted with a bases-loaded, no-out opportunity to rectify their critical errors and they almost squandered it. On a would-be inning-ending double play, a sloppily handled throw to first plated the tying runs.
The play was representative of a lot of USC’s play of late: offensive luck and offensive plight. Subsequent efforts would be fruitless, and the comeback kids would fail to come back.
“We’ve hit a little rough patch,” Hubbs said. “Every team goes through some adversity. We’ll go through ours right now and then be ready to play.”
The Trojans fell twice against the Pepperdine Waves last season, and Saturday’s afternoon matchup would not snap their losing streak. After holding what appeared to be a promising six-inning lead, USC buckled, never to recover from a five-run blunder, losing 10-4.
Eager to take advantage of early gifts in the form of a hit baseman and a wild pitch, freshman designated hitter Jeremy Martinez singled home the team’s first run. Additional hits from infielders Kevin Swick and Dante Flores pushed the score to three.
The powerful arm of junior Wyatt Strahan, however, couldn’t deceive the Waves. The righthander lasted only five innings, and was yanked after a spot of trouble that caused his line to balloon to six earned runs off seven hits and a pair of walks.
As if Strahan’s sixth-inning blemish wasn’t enough, a usually reliable bullpen faltered. Sophomore Sean Adler was unable to stop the bleeding, surrendering three additional runs himself, and could not retire a hitter in the seventh. In his relief, senior James Guillen would give up one run more, letting the Pepperdine run total reaching double digits.
“If you’re going to keep a good team in the game, then you’re asking to get beat,” Hubbs said. “Then we had a rough inning that broke it open for them.”
The Houston Cougars entered Friday’s contest touting a microscopic 0.73 staff ERA, which, as low as it was, was just shy of ace Aaron Garza’s 0.41. Garza entered Friday’s game after receiving his third consecutive American Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Week honor. His numbers turned out to be no fluke, and it was with a dominant pitching performance that he and the Cougars toppled USC, 6-1.
Hubb’s analysis was simple: “Friday we just flat-out got beat.”
Sophomore Kyle Twomey struggled with command early out of the gate, walking in the first Cougar run with two outs in the first inning. He would record six innings of work in the loss, allowing four runs (two earned) on eight hits and three walks.
Twomey certainly could have used the help of his teammates offensively, but he never got it. Garza limited the Trojans to one hit through the first five innings and only one run on five hits throughout eight innings.
The Trojans ultimately fell on their own swords, allowing a competitive Houston team to take advantage of sloppy play and free opportunities. Twomey and the bullpen allowed six walks and in yet another critical sixth inning, only one hit reached the outfield in a three-run rally.
The Trojans have yet to win on the road, but the team has a chance to change its luck and end its slump in a 6 p.m. matchup at Loyola Marymount on Tuesday. After all, there’s still plenty of time.
“It’s still early and we still have a positive record. We can turn this around,” Swick said. “We definitely have to clean up some stuff: on defense we’ve been a poor over the past week and a half, so if we clean that up, and get a couple of knocks, we’re right back in it.”
Steve: UCLA ranked 9th in last week’s NCBWA poll (not sure why the DT uses that poll, but they do)
Chill out, stop harassing college students
Seems very unlikely that the 7 and 7 ‘ruins were ranked 9th in the country although last two losses were this
past weekend. Hubbs use of the bullpen is unsatisfactory especially vs. ucla. The game tomorrow vs. LMU
is a home game not on the road. Is it too difficult to look up the schedule, and do your homework properly?

Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences professor of anthropology Thomas Garrison and USC Dornsife professor of religion Lynn Swartz Dodd along with a team of students began the excavation of Native Diver, a prize racehorse buried in 1967 at the Hollywood Park racetrack.
Neigh no more · The burial of prize racehorse Native Diver was excavated by a team of USC students at the Hollywood Park racetrack. – Photo courtesy of Thomas Garrison
The dig was made at the request of Richard Shapiro, grandson of Native Diver’s owner and breeder, Louis K. Shapiro. Native Diver was a prize racehorse in the 1960s and the first horse bred in California to earn more than $1 million. By the time of his death in 1967, he was the eighth highest earning horse of all time. A member of the Racing Hall of Fame, Native Diver set multiple world records and his 34 wins in stakes races remains an unmatched world record.
When the horse died at eight-years-old, he was buried at the Hollywood Park track in Inglewood, Calif. -— where many of his records were made. A large stone monument was erected about 30 yards away from his grave to memorialize the horse.
When the Hollywood Park track closed in December, plans to put an office building and shopping complex were announced. Shapiro reached out to USC for help in moving Native Diver’s remains.
“He’s racing royalty,” Shapiro told the Los Angeles Times. “You couldn’t leave a horse like this beneath a real estate development.”
The horse’s remains will be transferred to Del Mar racetrack until another burial site is prepared.
Archaeologists Dodd and Garrison led a team of Dornsife students in the excavation over the weekend.
The team of students was made up of volunteers from Garrison’s anthropology classes. The students invited to the project are currently studying archaeology and human interactions with ancient environments.
The project gave the students a chance to participate in an excavation of relatively recent remains. According to Garrison, the remains had relatively little deterioration. The students were able to experience a complete and successful excavation.
“The preservation of the remains is incredible,” Garrison said. “They were really able to see all of the parts of the animal.”
An initial probing expedition revealed that the remains were buried eight feet down. The team had to bring in a backhoe to do dig down to just above the remains before completing the final unearthing themselves.
The excavation wasn’t without its surprises. The team found that the horse’s ribcage was filled with sawdust. Because Native Diver died of colic, which affects the intestines, the coroner likely removed the intestines for examination and replaced them with sawdust, a common practice in the 1960s. They also discovered that the horse’s head was encased in a plastic bag.
Aside from the experience of participating in the excavation, Garrison said that having Shapiro with them was most beneficial for the students. Having someone connected to Native Diver enriched the excavation with personal details.
“He brought pictures and some of Native Diver’s prizes,” Garrison said. “He did a little presentation of the horse to the students. It really showed that we’re actually digging up the human past and things people have a connection with.”

The USC Fisher Museum of Art held its fourth annual Celebration of the Arts this Saturday, hosted by Students with Fisher@USC. 
The Celebration of the Arts is an afternoon filled with music, live entertainment, interactive art and free food. Students with Fisher@USC, an organization created by the museum to generate student interest in the arts, ran the celebration in the theme of one of the museum’s current exhibits, “Triumph of Philippine Art.”

Danielle Acheampong, the education and outreach coordinator for the Fisher Museum, explained the work that went into planning the event.
“The Students with Fisher@USC group thought it would be a good idea to kind of take a cultural or international perspective for our event, especially given how diverse our campus and community is,” Acheampong said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Acheampong noted that planning the Celebration of the Arts took a lot of teamwork and manpower in order to ensure a successful event and collaboration with the vendors and performers.
“We wanted the booths to relate to the theme in their own way and also have an interactive art piece for people to have fun with,” Acheampong said in an email.
Some of the many booths set up by vendors, nonprofits and USC organizations included 31 Bits, which sells eco-friendly jewelry made by women in Uganda, and Troy Philippines, a cultural organization at USC that seeks to promote Filipino culture, dance and music throughout campus.
“[Troy Philippines] wanted to be a part of the event, promoting the [Filipino] culture and helping out, especially because of the Philippine art exhibit that’s at Fisher right now,” said Zach Chaco, president of the group.
Troy Philippines’ interactive art booth had attendees make flowers for the Panagbenga Flower Festival, an annual celebration in Baguio, Philippines similar to the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, Calif.
Ani Mnatsakanyan, a junior majoring in art history, is part of Students with Fisher and helped organize the event. She expressed that events like the Celebration of the Arts are important to USC because art speaks to everyone.
“It doesn’t matter if you’re an art major or anything,” Mnatsakanyan said. “If you live in this world, you already have some relationship with art. That’s all it takes.”
Many of the students who came to enjoy the Celebration of the Arts supported this belief of interacting with art no matter your academic background.
Anthony Ge, a first-year graduate student majoring in mechanical engineering, said that he is interested in different forms of art and that his hobby is to interpret the art process.
“We don’t get enough exposure to modern arts in class, and I like that I can interact with different arts and art students today,” Ge said.
Acheampong stressed that the Celebration of the Arts gives students a way to interact and view art in a way that is not traditional.
“An event like Celebration gives students a chance to engage with art outside of an academic setting,” Acheampong said in an email. “It’s a chance to learn more about their campus and the campus community.”
Frieda Leung, a freshman majoring in accounting, noted that the Celebration of Arts was unique in the fact that it offered an experience often hard to find on campus.
“USC has a lot of performing arts, like Visions and Voices, but there aren’t a lot of opportunities for visual and interactive art that we had today,” Leung said. “The Celebration of the Arts provides that experience.”
I wish this had been more widely publicized to the Fil-Am community.

The Panhellenic Council has changed the official schedule for formal recruitment for the upcoming fall semester. 
Due to the first home football game taking place after the first week of classes, formal recruitment will begin with the symposium — the first event of the recruitment calendar — on the Friday before the first week of class.
Following the symposium, conversation days will take place on Saturday and Sunday, with house tours on Monday and Tuesday, slide show night on Wednesday and house preference selection on Thursday. The week will conclude with Bid Night on the Friday before the football game.
According to Panhellenic Council President Katherine Grabar, the schedule change was implemented to eliminate a gap between the first recruitment stages and Bid Night.
“We were comparing it to the schedule two years ago [when] we had a home game the first week of class,” Grabar said.
Grabar explained how that year the schedule was laid out in order to allow the home football game to be the middle of the recruitment process.
“We started conversation days on Sunday and Monday, then we had house tours on Tuesday and Wednesday, then narrowing it down to four houses was Thursday,” Grabar said. “Then, the max of two houses was on Friday. We then took a break for the game day.”
Grabar also discussed how the university has previously been reluctant to schedule formal recruitment early in the school year.
“The university has typically been hesitant to have early fall recruitment because the university wants the students to assimilate into USC first,” Grabar said.
Grabar explained, however, that the change in recruitment schedule is more academically beneficial for potential new members going through the recruitment process.
“The most intensive part of recruitment would occur before classes start,” Grabar said. “Sunday was typically a really intense day for conversation days for those with early Monday classes.”
Panhellenic Vice President of Recruitment Cat Brackett discussed how pausing the recruitment schedule for the football game can also create potentially dangerous situations.
“This mid-recruitment social activity … left potential new members alone to fend for themselves and monitor their own alcohol intake on their first game day,” Brackett said. “This was dangerous and devastating for many potential new members and may have caused a number of new member hospital transports in the past.”
Brackett also discussed the benefit of changing formal recruitment scheduling.
“Our recruitment counselors will even have a less stressful first week as well by not having the overwhelming task of conflict scheduling conversation days around each of their potential new members’ class schedules,” Brackett said. “This makes the process easier not only for many of our chapters and for potential new members, but for the Panhellenic recruitment team as well.”
Gwen Holst, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, political economy and neuroscience and a member of Alpha Gamma Delta, commented on how the first home game can potentially be a bonding experience for new members.
“Come [game day], once recruitment results are known, the pilgrimage to the Coliseum will be an excellent opportunity to rendezvous either with members of a new organization or friends made during the recruitment process,” Holst said.
Some, however, disagree with the decision.
Lindsay Dale, a junior majoring in communication and a member of Alpha Chi Omega, believes that an earlier recruitment schedule might make the recruitment more difficult for both active and new members.
“It’s an awful inconvenience for sorority actives and rushees alike,” Dale said. “This means that everyone already in sororities will have to cut their summer even shorter to prepare for rush.”

Hackers’ delight · Students from a variety of different schools in California, such as USC and Stanford, attended HackSC which took place from March 7-9. The coders hacked for 36 hours straight. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
From Friday night and going until Sunday afternoon, programmers from all over the state arrived at USC for HackSC, a 36-hour hackathon.
A hackathon is a conference in which programmers gather, arrange themselves in teams, and then spend the next few days in a programming marathon trying to create the best final project in so short a time.
HackSC began the way many hackathons do: with a commencement speech made by a fellow hackathon goer. USC brought in the COO of Oculus Virtual Reality, Laird Malamed, to speak to the programmers.
Malamed discussed his love for computer science and programming, inspiring students by telling stories of successful programmers who started their careers through their hackathon projects.
Idean Keshmirian, a freshman majoring in computer science, commented on the commencement address.
“It’s basically a pep talk, trying to get us pumped up, you know?” Keshmirian said. “It actually works. You walk away feeling like the things you do here could really lead to something.”
David Bell, a freshman majoring in computer science, noted the degree of commitment the programmers go through.
“Most of [the programmers] probably haven’t slept all night so you may be questioning a bunch of coding monsters,” he said.
Bell seemed to have the right idea.
“Hell no, I’m not sleeping! Sleep is for the rich and I ain’t rich yet,” said Okky Jy, a sophomore from Santa Monica Community College.
Saturday was a day dedicated to coding, and each team found a classroom where they set up camp.
Brian Kim served as the head organizer of the Hackathon and of HackSC and noted the intense preparation involved.
“There is so much that goes into planning an event like this,” Kim said. “We had to talk to the administration, make sure we had caterers and vendors, reach out to other communities, among other things.”
His aim for the event was to expand programming opportunities to those who normally wouldn’t have the chance.
“Our goal with HackSC was to give the students a lot of support as they worked,” Kim said. “We tried to find students that were interested in programming but didn’t really know how to do it outside of a classroom. We’ve set up a mentoring program so it’s less intimidating and more enjoyable.” We wanted HackSC to be a learning experience for young programmers.”
Keshmirian also commented on the welcoming nature of USC’s hackathon.
“I’ve been to other hackathons where no one wants a beginner on their team,” Keshmirian said. “It’s a warmer environment here. I feel happy being here. I haven’t been excluded at all, and I don’t feel like a nerd here.”
Each team decided on one project to collaborate on and then worked tirelessly towards a final product. One group in particular was working on a project named Textres, a search engine which works through SMS text messaging.
“This idea would be especially relevant to developing countries that have cellular capabilities but don’t have smart phones,” Kim said. “These people could text ‘Where’s the nearest hospital?’ and receive a text response.”
Sunday morning, those who attended HackSC gathered to demo their projects. Later in the day, the winners of the competition were announced. A team from California Polytechnic State University, Pomona, won first place with an immersive  Oculus Rift Flappy Bird clone with crowd interaction. A USC team followed in second place.
“This really isn’t about the competition, though,” Kim said. “We just wanted to provide up and coming programmers with an opportunity to create.”
Editor’s note: This post has been updated.
USC team was second place.  Good article though.
The team was from California Polytechnic State University, Pomona.

This week, Apple announced more details for CarPlay, a retrofitted iOS interface that would link your phone with the dashboard of your car. Perhaps more exciting than the interface itself was the crop of auto partners that will be using the feature: Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo announced that CarPlay will be in their cars in 2014, with just about every other major auto company expected to follow with their own.

With a little less fanfare, Samsung announced that they are developing their own auto-interface called Drive Link, with the Indian auto company Tata Motors being the first to use it. Its most notable feature will be the ability to start a car with the Samsung Galaxy Gear (for the Batman in all of us).
Though Samsung has expanded its products into other industries, this is a different approach on Apple’s part, which has never really been so directly involved in a non-computer industry outside of brief flirtations such as with Nest (which now belongs to Google). So why such a bold entrance into an industry that it’s never been in before?
The truth of the matter is likely more literal: Apple doesn’t need to be in the auto industry as much as the auto industry needs Apple to be in it.
The fact is that not only are people not buying new vehicles, but more and more people are either choosing not to drive or are driving less. Though there are a number of factors ranging from the recession to the still-crippling price of gas (which has creeped back over $4 in the general Los Angeles area), another factor is that it’s a cultural transition. With more people living in the city, folks are relying more on riding the Metro, walking, and biking to get around town.
Nearly every public infrastructure initiative that’s occurred in Los Angeles recently has been a means of making the town more walking-friendly, diminishing traffic and decreasing the carbon footprint of automobiles. Though it’s been an excruciatingly long process, by the end of the decade, the Metro will have expanded in a such a way that someone living in Santa Monica could take a train to Pasadena, or someone from North Hollywood could ride to Long Beach without switching lines and a person near the Ontario Airport could take a rail to LAX if need be.
Nowhere is it more apparent that U.S. culture is shifting away from vehicular dependence than with the younger generation: The University of Michigan found that only 69.5 percent of 19-year-olds had acquired their drivers’ licenses in 2010, compared to 87 percent in 1983, with many saying their reason was either that the cost of maintaining a vehicle was too high or that they’d rather just walk or ride a bike.
So with many young people not even acquiring licenses, the auto industry is faced with a huge conundrum of trying to sell new vehicles in the face of such a fundamental cultural shift. A touch-based interface in your car isn’t anything new; however, by associating with the iOS interface, the ability to directly sync your contacts, music and locational information, all powered by Siri, seems to be a more convenient alternative than trying to use your phone when you’re driving.
The car industry is trying to make people excited to use a car — which seems like a superficial purpose, but it’s critical. A car used to be a symbol of social status, and though a nice car is still a good thing to possess, it’s seen as a commodity — not a required asset of your identity. Instead of developing their own interface, partnering with Apple and Samsung makes the transition easier.
Of course, a reliable interface will become all the more important for auto companies as it builds towards the next big trend: self-driving vehicles. With companies progressively getting the necessary legal approval for automated vehicles, a person’s ability to get into a car, have their phone sync up automatically and have the car drive them to a destination without so much as touching the wheel is going to be a major selling point. Making the car the pinnacle of technological ingenuity once again is likely the only, and best, way to convince a person to purchase a new vehicle.

Dropping out of college doesn’t usually portend the brightest of futures for students, especially considering the United States’ current economic state. But it’s tough to argue against comedian Shelby Fero’s decision to leave USC early to jump right into the comedy workforce.

Twenty-year-old Fero is a writer for FX’s new comedy Chozen, and receives sole writing credit for the series’ newest episode set to air Monday night.
The former screenwriting major certainly has gotten a fast start in a business that usually puts aspirants through the grinder before they can make a comfortable living.
In high school, Fero started going to open mics in San Francisco, where she was the youngest performer in a pool consisting mostly of middle-aged wannabes. After her dry, self-deprecating wit helped her become one of the first comedians to establish a fanbase through Twitter (she now has more than 104,000 followers), Fero migrated south to attend USC — but she never planned on staying there long.
“I had come down to Los Angeles all the time, so I kinda knew what USC was like — you know, L.A.-y,” Fero said.  “It turned out to be what I thought it would be, pretty much … I wanted to leave immediately.”
At a college well-known for its “work hard, play hard” mentality, the reserved Fero felt out of place.
“I don’t really party,” Fero said, “So I felt bad that I didn’t like to do what others were doing. So I was thinking, ‘Maybe it’s just better if I didn’t go here.’”
After fulfilling a promise to her father by sticking it out for her freshman year, Fero dove headfirst into her work.
Fero helped write the pilot of The Pete Holmes Show before it was picked up by TBS, appeared in several sketches of Comedy Central’s Key and Peele, boasts endorsements from veteran comedians including Patton Oswalt and Paul F. Tompkins and is represented by the Creative Artists Agency, one of Hollywood’s top talent agencies.
Less than three years after graduating from Menlo-Atherton High School in Northern California, Fero has her own place on Sunset Boulevard, so one can hardly blame her for feeling like there wasn’t much for her to gain by staying at USC. When the producers of Chozen offered her a staff writing position, she knew she had to take advantage.
“You have to get that first [job], and then it’s really easy to jump around [to different opportunities],” Fero said. “But getting that first one is really hard.”
Even after securing that initial credential, writers have no guarantees when it comes to future success — it’s just the first step in a long journey that many aspiring entertainers never complete.
“You have to know that you may never be a famous writer, or director, or producer,” Fero said. “You still have to go, ‘You know what? I’d still rather take a sh-tty job at WB [Warner Bros.] than be a schoolteacher,’ or, whatever.”
And Fero knows that she’s fortunate to have already attained several impressive resume points at an age where most comedians haven’t even taken a first step into the industry.
“I’m super lucky people put up with my immaturity. Because if they hadn’t, maybe if they didn’t think they were going to get returns …” Fero trailed off. “It’s probably hard to get out of college and get hit in the face with the failure that comedians have to deal with right off the bat. When you’re young, and you just graduated college and are feeling all successful, you probably are too proud to deal with that stuff.”
Fero has undoubtedly managed to bypass some of the obstacles that derail the careers of other young comedians. As performers exit college and enter the real world, many begin to encounter commonplace problems — namely, how to pay the rent — that put their less-profitable ambitions on hold.
USC cinematic arts professor James Staahl said that developing writing talent while maintaining a signature sense of individuality is the best way for comedians to distance themselves from their peers — but they have to cultivate that uniqueness on their own.
“Each industry has a ladder to success,” said Staahl, who taught Fero in her short stay at USC. “But in comedy, the first couple rungs are missing — and you have to find some way to boost yourself up. Everyone’s story is different, and everyone gets in a writers’ room through different routes.”
Some comedians, like Louis C.K., paid their dues for decades by performing at open mics and occasionally booking smaller paid gigs before finally achieving widespread success; countless others, of course, toiled in underground clubs for years and never manage to make the leap to the big stage. But others, like Fero, provide hope that a burgeoning comedy field has plenty of room for more young hopefuls like herself.
“I would’ve been fine working a shitty job for 10 years before getting a good gig,” Fero said. “I’m just lucky that I could do it faster.”
Chozen airs on Mondays on FX at 10:30 p.m.

Teen films are notorious for getting slammed by serious critics. When the trailer for Divergent was released earlier last year, many were quick to point out the movie’s seemingly large resemblance to The Hunger Games. Both stories were originally written as novels, are read largely by young adults, are set in a dystopian future and feature a female protagonist.

Based on the screening and press conference for what is predicted to be 2014’s top-grossing film, it is clear that Divergent actually deviates from the mold set by The Hunger Games. The movie is not a two-hour long blood fest starring 24 unlucky district representatives. Instead, it revolves around a girl who is struggling to identify herself in a society where individuality has been eradicated. This battle is one that resonates loudly with many people today, and is one that Veronica Roth, author of the trilogy, experienced herself.
“When I was 16, I felt I had to decide right then what I wanted to do with my life,” she said at a press conference.
Inspired by the pressure of society and the expectation felt during her college years, Roth created the character Beatrice Prior, played in the movie by Shailene Woodley.
“I felt like when I was Beatrice’s age, I sort of went through the same thing,” Woodley said at the conference. “I would ask myself things like, ‘How do I balance everything and not base my decisions on those around me?’”
Struggling underneath the suffocating guise of conformity, Divergent explores the “what-ifs” of its world: What if the so-called utopian society that the story is set in was actually filled with flaws? What if there were a group of citizens who were able to resist commands? What if they did start to fight back?
Set in futuristic Chicago, the film introduces the viewers to the motto, “Faction before blood.” In what seems like a utopian world, every member is divided into one of five factions: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Erudite and Dauntless. This system allows control over the citizens and minimizes threats to the system. Every year, 16-year-olds must take an aptitude test that will determine which faction they are best suited for. Unlike all the other test-takers, however, Beatrice’s results are inconclusive. This makes her a “divergent,” someone who identifies with multiple factions; in other words, someone who threatens the system. Told to keep her test results from everyone else, Beatrice spends the rest of the movie attempting to fit in with her faction members, discovering the cracks in the government system and — of course — falling in love with her attractive instructor, Four (Theo James).
What makes Divergent a fun watch is the fact that the viewers get to grow and develop alongside the characters. The story doesn’t focus exclusively on the action scenes; instead, viewers are given insight into the history of the characters and the society in which they live. Beatrice herself is a complex character who has contradicting traits — she is fearless but not intimidating, naïve but clever, audacious but physically weak — she is relatable in her humanity. This made director Neil Burger’s task more difficult, as he had to portray all her contrasting attributes in one film.
“There are so many genres all at once,” Berger said. But that is what makes this film exciting. Beatrice’s life is traced out carefully for the viewer from her time in Abnegation to her accepting the fact that she is divergent.
“I know it’s a young adult film but I was making an adult movie,” Burger said.
This statement is made clear in the fight scene. It is incredibly rare to sit through a movie and watch the lead actress get beat up to the point of unconsciousness. The scenes are visually disturbing, but somehow, weirdly refreshing. To see Beatrice on the floor, face bruised, is quite a sight. The image speaks to the strength of the female protagonist in the movie. Though she is lying lifelessly on the mat with blood streaming down her face, it is clear that she is equal to the men in the movie.
All in all, Divergent will easily become a favorite for moviegoers who are not of the serious sort. This movie is for those who need an hour-and-a-half break from reality and for those who like getting lost in a different world. It might not be groundbreaking, but Divergent is fun and captivating. So enjoy the movie for what it is: a fusion of sci-fi, action and a hint of chick-flick.

I’ll be the first to admit that the past few months have been busy, leaving me with little time for basic needs such as doing laundry. So it comes as no surprise that I didn’t have a chance to sit down and catch the Academy Awards live.
I did, however, manage to sneak a peek at the winners. Of all the smiling faces I saw clutching that shiny golden statue, there was one particular face that stood out to me.
Splashed across entertainment channels and news clippings was a woman donning a flowing baby blue dress and a beautiful smile: actress Lupita Nyong’o. Nyong’o, who stepped on stage to accept her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave on March 2, became an overnight sensation.
I started to wonder what it was that had the world buzzing about Nyong’o. She’s certainly stunning, but why the sudden fixation?
Upon closer look, I realized that the United States’ latest obsession with Nyong’o reveals an interesting thing about our perception of beauty; with so few women of color in the entertainment industry to begin with, it’s no wonder we’re stunned by Nyong’o.
As Forbes contributor Anushay Hossain wrote, “All the Hollywood fawning and ogling over her is making me more uncomfortable than proud, mainly because it serves as a reminder that moments like this for women of color do not occur nearly as often as they should.”
The Representation Project, an international campaign that hopes to transform the portrayal of women in the media, echoed this sentiment in a recent graphic published on their Facebook page. Their infographic describes how “just 6 of the top 500 box office films of all time feature a protagonist who is a woman of color.”
An Oct. 2013 study conducted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism revealed “films still under-represented minority characters and directors, and reflect certain biases in their portrayal.”
The importance of featuring women of color in film and television is often understated. The inclusion of women of color broadens society’s ideas of beauty. Women are typically portrayed as sexualized creatures and these tall and busty Caucasian characters do not properly reflect the current makeup of the U.S. population. Such an idealization leads minority women to feel that they are inadequate.
Growing up, I never saw women of color portrayed in film or television as the protagonist. I can only hope that in the future, young girls will have the opportunity to identify with women such as Lupita Nyong’o — women who resemble the skin color of the viewer.
Nyong’o is using her newfound fame as a platform to discuss society’s idea of beauty when she recently delivered a speech at the 7th annual Black Women in Hollywood Luncheon on Feb. 27.
She opened her speech by reading a letter she had received from a fan: “Dear Lupita … I think you’re really lucky to be this black but yet this successful in Hollywood overnight. I was just about to buy Dencia’s Whitenicious cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me.”
It’s unfortunate that Nyong’o’s darker complexion would not be admired in some parts of the world. According to the Wall Street Journal, skin-lightening is a $400 million business in India. This business is one that I have the opportunity to see in full effect when I travel to India every few years.
Indian shelves are generally stocked with skin lightening brands such as Fair and Lovely, which constantly promote the notion that beauty comes in the form of fair-skinned women with European features.
For women of color to accept that beauty comes in all forms, the inclusion of women of color in film and television is extremely important.
As Nyong’o said in the final moments of her acceptance speech, “I hope that my presence on your screens and in the magazines may lead you, young girl, on a similar journey. That you will feel the validation of your external beauty but also get to the deeper business of being beautiful inside. There is no shade to that beauty.”

On March 5, digital artist Nickolay Lamm launched a crowdfunding campaign to make a toy doll modeled after Barbie — but with a twist: The doll would have the proportions of the average 19-year-old woman, according to statistics by the Center for Disease Control.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
The news has gotten widespread approval from the media, helping Lamm raise nearly $150,000 — 50 percent more than his $95,000 goal — in less than two days.
It’s not exactly news that Barbie is even more unrealistic looking than the ads of airbrushed and photoshopped supermodels that greet women every time they open a magazine. According to rehabs.com, if looked at as a real body, Barbie’s neck is twice as long as normal, her waist would only be able to fit half her liver and part of her intestine and she wouldn’t be able to walk because her feet are too small.
What’s new, however, is that someone is finally challenging Barbie’s throne — and it’s about time. Since 1959, Barbie has been imposing her over-sexualized and underweight reign of terror on young girls. The problem with Lamm’s doll — self-indulgently dubbed Lammily — however, is that if an individual were to pick a randomly-selected woman, she wouldn’t look like Barbie, and she certainly wouldn’t look like Lammily.
Lammily is considered average size, which means that approximately half of all 19-year-old girls are shorter than her and the other half taller and half weigh less and half weigh more. The media, however, seems to think that just because Lammily is based on the supposed “average,” she suddenly represents all women.
The most cringe-worthy part? The motto for the new doll is “Average is beautiful.” Average isn’t beautiful because average doesn’t exist. Every young girl is unique, in both her looks and her personality, and she should be taught to take pride in her differences — not to aspire to normalcy.
Just as a mother wouldn’t tell her daughter she should try to do “average” in school, or get an “average” job, or make an “average” effort in what she is passionate about, society’s young girls shouldn’t be told to try to look “average” either. Instead, she should be celebrated for her differences. What makes the world beautiful isn’t a statistically based compilation of everyone, but rather it’s that no one quite looks the same. In a single stroke, this doll eliminates one societal problem — unrealistic portrayals of women — and becomes another: girls’ desire to just fit in.
A doll like Lammily certainly has its benefits. A 2006 study published in Developmental Psychology showed that “girls exposed to Barbie reported lower body esteem and greater desire for a thinner body shape than girls in the other exposure conditions.” A doll such as Lammily, with more normal body proportions, is probably less likely to cause such a reaction.
But what about girls who are naturally super skinny? Voluptuous? What happened to the “shapes” magazines are always asking readers to divide themselves into: flute, apple, pear, hourglass?
Where are the tall girls and the petite ones? The ones who are African American, Asian, Hispanic, Indian, Native American?
Having a realistic-looking doll is helpful in that it is one step away from the fetishization of the unattainable that constantly surrounds girls from the time they are old enough to be fully cognizant of their surroundings. From Disney princesses with huge eyes and tiny waists to billboards of airbrushed models to kids’ television shows whose actors wear a full face of makeup at the age of 10, its hard for girls to see reflections of themselves in pop culture.
But the media has been too quick to embrace this doll. Slapping some brown hair and slightly bigger thighs on a Caucasian doll isn’t going to solve society’s issue with images of women. And glorifying “average” isn’t a positive message to send to young girls either.
Isabella Sayyah is a sophomore majoring in international relations and print and digital journalism. She is also the associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan. 
OK, Isabella Sayyah may be correct:  A ridiculously proportioned, unrealistically thin figure on Barbie may contribute to eating disorders and other psychological problems, because girls and women cannot achieve the impossible, sickly-thin, shapes held up as desirable. Fine, got it. 
But Ms Sayyah also finds that “glorifying average” shapes would also be unhelpful for little girls. So what does that leave for them to play with? Easy, right? Dollmakers should produce a wide range of colors, shapes and styles and let the little girls choose? Guess what? They did that centuries ago. The little girls will choose to play with the glamorous, attractive, but unrealistically thin Barbie shapes, and the others will sit unpurchased on the shelves. Then the toy manufacturers will withdraw those offerings and concentrate on Barbie-shaped dolls. Yes, because they sell.
Same with anorexic-looking, painfully thin models with rail-shaped legs and curveless bodies. Whom do you think prefers that shape? Men? No. The women who visualize themselves wearing those clothes. They identify with the starved-looking models, not average or plump ones, or clothing designers would not use those overly thin models. In a free-market world, commercial goods and services reflect what consumers will favor and purchase. Sorry, but there it is.
