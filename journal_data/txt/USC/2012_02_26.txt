USC baseball is 7-0 for the first time since 1988 after sweeping the University of Akron over the weekend at Dedeaux Field, capped by a 9-5 win in the series finale on Sunday.
“It’s awesome to see these guys have fun and really enjoy what they’re doing,” USC coach Frank Cruz said of his team’s boisterous celebration in the clubhouse following the sweep. “It’s really neat. And I hope they don’t forget the feeling of winning, and how good it feels to win.”
It was the Zips who got on the board first, as freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley struggled to find his control to start the game. Three walks and a hit-by-pitch, coupled with an error by senior right fielder Alex Sherrod, who lost the ball in the sun, put the Trojans in a 3-0 hole heading into the bottom of the second.
“I’m OK with [Tarpley] struggling now,” Cruz said. “To get that out of the way and understand ‘Hey, I really need to be prepared and I’m not gonna just step out on the mound and be good.’”
In the bottom of the second, back-to-back two-out hits by freshman second baseman Dante Flores and freshman center fielder Garrett Stubbs left the Trojans down by one run. After a walk, Sherrod stepped up with the bases loaded and promptly unloaded them, igniting the crowd at Dedeaux Field.
“They had been throwing me first-pitch changeups all series, assuming I was gonna take,” Sherrod said of his first career grand slam that put USC up 6-3. “So if you know a changeup is coming that’s pretty much [batting practice].”
The lefty Sherrod turned on the first-pitch changeup, smacking it high off the parking structure in right field and giving the Trojans a lead they did not relinquish.
Akron slowly began to chip their way back, plating one in the fourth and another in the sixth to make it a one-run game. But the Trojans broke the game open with three runs in the eighth to make the final score 9-5.
“It’s the most fun I’ve had here,” Sherrod said. “Winning makes everything better.”
The Trojan bullpen was stellar, using five pitchers over the final five innings while allowing just one run in relief of Tarpley, who went four-plus innings and managed his first career win.
In two games against Akron before Sunday’s series finale, the Trojans’ consistent offense and strong pitching also helped carry the team to victory.
On Saturday, the freshman connection of Flores and Stubbs made some of the game’s biggest contributions. With the score tied in the bottom of the second, Flores ripped a triple to right, then Stubbs knocked an RBI grounder to short to put USC in the lead.
Two innings later, Flores and Stubbs again combined to produce a Trojan run. Flores smacked a long sacrifice fly to advance runners to second and third, and Stubbs again grounded out up the middle, giving USC a 4-2 lead.
While the freshmen were playing small ball, Sherrod was again not. The Trojan right fielder crushed his first home run of the year — a parking-structure bomb to right field.
Bolstered by his strong offensive support, Trojan pitcher Ben Mount rolled through the Akron lineup. The senior put down the Zips in the first, fifth and sixth innings, including striking out the side in the fifth. And thanks to a double-play in the third and a runner caught stealing in the fourth, he faced just three hitters in every inning except the second and seventh.
Mount’s line read seven innings pitched, allowing just two runs on seven hits with eight strikeouts while walking exactly no one.
Perhaps Mount was inspired on Saturday by his teammate’s performance the night before. On Friday, senior pitcher Andrew Triggs asserted his dominance, going eight innings while allowing just one run on four hits, one walk, and eight strikeouts to pick up the win and improve to 2-0.

It was around 1 a.m. on Saturday. As students made their way to parties and residents made their way to bed, Dept. of Public Safety officer Kenneth Whittaker pulled into a driveway on Adams Street. His last call was to a home on Orchard Avenue where a woman told an officer from the Los Angeles Police Department about a domestic violence issue.
Parked in the driveway with more than six hours left in his eight-and-a-half hour patrol, Whittaker decided which incident to respond to next. Whittaker glanced at his steno pad, where he jots down notes, like addresses, times and descriptions, throughout the night.
The Police · Dept. of Public Safety officer Kenneth Whittaker works the graveyard shift and is responsible for patrolling Area D, which is the area north of campus. - Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
“I’m getting my thoughts together,” he said.
Whittaker, a law enforcement officer with 15 years of experience under his belt, joined DPS’ force in October. Thursday through Sunday he patrols in Area D, which spans from Vermont Avenue to Hoover Street between Adams Boulevard and Jefferson Boulevard. DPS assigns its officers to patrols in five areas, labeled A through E.
Whittaker said the most frequent calls he responds to are noise complaints. He said DPS is typically aware of large parties before they patrol each night.
“We are usually notified of any big, big parties and any outgoing parties that [students] might be going to off campus,” he said.
Earlier in the night, just after 11:30 p.m. on Friday, Whittaker received a noise complaint on Menlo Street. The cold air swept through the car as Whittaker drove to the party; he said he drives with his windows open so he can hear suspicious behavior in the area. Whittaker also listens to the dispatch officer through an earpiece in his right ear, so suspects cannot overhear any vital information.
“It’s a little more discreet in case I’m talking to a bad guy, a real bad guy, and they want to pass on pertinent information to me,” he said. “I can hear it and he can’t. We have codes that we say over the radio and sometimes, believe it or not, the bad guys know the codes.”
Two additional officers arrived at the party on Menlo Avenue and began talking to the students responsible for the party. After the students complied with DPS’ advisement to turn down the music and control the party, the officers left.
“A lot of things they do after we get here, they could do before we get here,” Whittaker said. “So if they just policed themselves, they’d be all right. We would never have to be here if they just policed themselves.”
Whittaker said that after the first warning, DPS will likely not be as lenient if law enforcement receives another complaint about the same party.
“Hopefully we don’t have to go back to that location and if we do, we might be a little harsher,” Whittaker said. “We might have to go ahead and shut it down for the night.”
From the training DPS officers receive — the Los Angeles Police Department Police Academy, training at the DPS station and a daily evaluation — Whittaker believes the most applicable thing he learned was how to resolve disputes through talking to people.
“They teach you in the academy what they call verbal judo,” he said. “You always want to verbalize first with anything. I think sometimes, and more so for a university, when you explain something in its simplest form to where the person understands it, it solves a lot of problems.”
Whittaker, a Los Angeles native who is also familiar with USC’s surrounding area from his former police work, said he has seen the area change dramatically in recent years.
“If you would have told me Figueroa would have grown this big as far as businesses and growth of apartment buildings for students, I never would have believed it,” Whittaker said. “Just south of campus, Tuscany used to be a club, Margarita Jones. Just north of that was a billiard place for pool tables.”
As with growth in any city, Whittaker said there has been an increase in crime.
At 1:30 a.m., Whittaker joined another DPS officer at a home on 22nd Street where two Apple laptops had been stolen.
The two officers made official reports of the burglary and advised the students to use locks to secure their computers in the future. They said criminals respond to an opportunity to commit crime and having a lock minimizes that opportunity.
Whittaker said that theft has been a big issue and that students could be more active in taking measures to protect their property.
“We have a lot of thefts of laptops and iPhones that are being left out on desktops unattended,” he said. “The crime can be reduced if the student or students take a little more action in putting their things away either in a car, a locker or just having someone watch their property.”
Whittaker’s patrol shift lasted until 7:30 a.m. When his watch is over, Whittaker said he goes right to sleep to prepare to do it all over again the next night.
“I’ve worked graveyard pretty much my whole career,” he said. “It is just a matter of adjusting and getting your sleep.”

Friday marked the 100th anniversary of the nickname Trojans to be used to describe USC athletic teams.
The famed moniker was first seen in the Los Angeles Times when sports writer Owen Bird wrote a column previewing a track meet between USC and Occidental College.
“The Oxy Tiger will be seen in action for the first time this season, in the clash with Dean Cromwell’s USC Trojans on the Bovard cinder trail,” Bird said in his column.
In 1912 USC student-athletes ceased to be called the Methodists, Wesleyans and Cardinals.
When asked decades later why he chose the name “Trojans,” Bird said that USC athletes “were facing teams that were bigger and better-equipped, yet they had splendid fighting spirit. The name Trojans fitted them.”
J.K. McKay, senior associate athletic director, said this legacy is what makes the Trojan tradition so unique.
“We definitely take seriously our tradition and remember our past,” McKay said. “I’ve been a Trojan since my dad became the head football coach when I was seven. The ‘Fight On!’ mindset has been an important part of my life ever since.”
To honor the legacy and commemorate the anniversary of the Trojan moniker, the Athletic Department is launching a 100 Years as Trojans celebration, which will feature its own unique logo to be used for various events.
The festivities began Friday as the baseball team defeated Akron and the No. 1 men’s tennis team defeated San Diego State and University of San Diego.
McKay said 2012 marks the anniversary of many important events in USC Athletics’ history.
“There seem to be a lot of anniversaries to celebrate in 2012,” McKay said. “In addition to 100 years as Trojans, 60 years ago my dad led USC to its very first national championship in football. This is also the 50-year anniversary of arguably the most successful Trojan football season in history. The 1972 team that I played on went undefeated the entire season, winning the Rose Bowl and national championship.”
Under the Trojan nickname, USC has won 116 national championships and 393 USC students have competed in the Olympic Games.
Clara Hill, a senior majoring in international relations, said the Trojan name represents not only USC Athletics, but also the university as a whole.
“Everyone I’ve encountered here is ready to take on the next challenge and go the extra mile,” Hill said. “Being a Trojan means fighting on even when things get hard.”
Sam Lejfer, a freshman majoring in business administration and cinematic arts, said the ideals of a Trojan are present in all USC students.
“The name Trojans symbolizes what it means to fight on despite the circumstances,” Lejfer said. “It’s not just a mascot; it’s an ideal embodied in every student.”
I beat JK to Trojan status by a couple of years.  I was ten when my dad (who was at SC in the twenties), and I went to the Coliseum to see SC play Notre Dame in 1950.  We were late.  It was cool and foggy.  The Coliseum was covered in ivy and the pigeons flew in flocks.  We could hear the massive crowd long before we got into the stadium, and once we emerged from a tunnel the noise was stunning because Jim Sears was running a kickoff back for a TD.  Gifford and Carmichael also had good afternoons; and Gifford, especially, seemed to be all over the place.  Was I stuck on USC from that point on?  Just ask anyone who has had to suffer my presence watching SC football.

Students for Sensible Drug Policy, a student-lead organization, held the California Cannabis Initiatives Forum on Sunday at Taper Hall with an aim to better educate the public about current marijuana initiatives and to discuss which marijuana initiative the group might support on the November ballot.
High law · Students for Sensible Drug Policy hosted a panel Sunday in Taper Hall to educate the community on legalization initiatives. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The forum featured five activists representing different marijuana initiatives, which all would legalize marijuana for general consumption. Each described the initiative they support and the benefits it could have on the greater community, along with answering questions concerning the prospect of their initiative being voted on in November.
SSDP President and founder Steven Hwang said the biggest goal for the forum was to unify the five different initiatives vying for a spot on the 2012 ballot to increase the chances that one combined initiative will garner the 500,000 signatures needed to get on the ballot.
“None of them are currently on track to make the ballot,” Hwang said. “By uniting the initiatives, we could make sure that none of them are competing for resources, [which would] then allow one to be on the ballot, which would be one step closer to the legalization of marijuana.”
Hwang, a senior majoring in human performance, said SSDP’s main goal is to promote drug awareness at a local and national level, while also addressing changing drug policies.
“SSDP is an international grassroots network of students [who] are concerned about the effect that drug use has on our community,” Hwang said. “We’re also aware that the war on drugs is harming our generation.”
The activists varied in specifics of marijuana legalization, such as quantity allowed and means of production.
Matthew Lundgren, a freshman majoring in business administration and cinematic arts and an SSDP member, said engaging in discussion about drug policy helped him understand current initiatives.
“I [came] to familiarize myself with the different initiatives and learn more about each one from the forum,” Lundgren said. “It’s important to discuss drug policy, because if people don’t discuss it, then people won’t question the current ways of doing things.”
Robert Ha, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies and an SSDP member, said a drug policy initiative should be on the November ballot because current drug policy is flawed.
“I support the repeal prohibition act because, in general, prohibition has been proven not to work, especially with a substance that is not dangerous,” Ha said. “It’s especially important in the United States, because a significant amount of money is used to help fund the [Drug Enforcement Administration].”
Hwang said SSDP hopes to be the leader in campus activism toward facilitating the creation and encouragement of new drug policy legislation.
“We want to kind of lead the campus in being better and more informed about drugs, and foster a discussion, and then eventually lead statewide policy at that point,” Hwang said.
Marijuana is already legal if a prosecutor cannot find a puritain jury where everyone votes to convict.
That is  a very difficult task given the growing knowledge of jury nullification.

USC men’s tennis returned home for the first time in nearly a month to face two San Diego schools looking to snap the Trojans’ 31-match win streak spanning from last February.
Instead, No. 1 USC (13-0) tallied two more with straight set sweeps over No. 24 San Diego (5-3) and San Diego State (5-2) in a doubleheader Friday.
Hard to beat · Sophomore Ray Sarmiento has helped lead the No. 1 Trojans to 31 straight wins dating back to last February. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Despite playing in their sixth match in a week, the Trojans took down the San Diego Toreros 7-0 in the evening match behind No. 47 sophomore Emilio Gomez’s 6-4, 6-2 clincher over Clarke Spinosa on court three.
Gomez bounced back from an early 0-3 deficit in the first set to win his 10th singles match in a row giving USC a 4-0 advantage over San Diego.
No. 11 senior Steve Johnson and No. 86 freshman Roberto Quiroz earned the first two singles points before Gomez’s win.
Johnson, who was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Men’s Team Indoors Championships last weekend, defeated No. 77 Nikola Bubnic 6-4, 6-2 for his 47th-straight singles win.
With the victory in hand, No. 36 freshman Yannick Hanfmann, No. 18 sophomore Ray Sarmiento and freshman Jordi Vives finished their opponents for USC’s 7-0 advantage.
“I was feeling physically beat out in the second match, but I kept telling myself one point at a time,” Sarmiento said. “At the end of the day, you just have to tough it out.”
Sarmiento, who is 22-7 in singles this season, defeated No. 74 Patrick Pohlmann, one of San Diego’s three ranked players, 6-4, 6-1. Hanfmann took down the other, No. 97 Thibaut Visy, 6-2, 6-4.
In doubles action, the No. 28 pair of Hanfmann and Johnson began with an 8-2 win over Bubnic and Visy. Senior Daniel Nguyen and freshman Eric Johnson capped off the doubles point for USC with an 8-5 finish over Ciaran Fitzgerald and Pohlmann.
Earlier in the day, the Trojans swept No. 60 San Diego State 7-0. Quiroz secured the victory with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Rickey Baylon on court four.
The first two singles points against the Aztecs came from Sarmiento and Johnson on courts one and five, respectively. After Quiroz’s clincher, Hanfmann, Nguyen and freshman Jonny Wang defeated their opponents to give USC the sweep.
To handle the potential fatigue of the doubleheader, USC needed a complete team effort with court action given to more than just their six ranked Trojans.
“The 7th Man guys are great support. It’s really nice to see them out there fighting with us,” Sarmiento said.
The last time that the Trojans played at Marks Stadium was a 6-1 win over No. 49 UNC-Wilmington on Jan. 29.
“It’s nice to be back [at home],” Hanfmann said. “People are supporting us and it’s so much easier with the crowd.”
The time back home will be short-lived, as the Trojans will hit the road again Wednesday and take their undefeated record to the Los Angeles Tennis Center to face No. 8 UCLA (11-1) at 3 p.m.

After losing to California four-consecutive times, USC broke their losing streak against the Golden Bears on Saturday afternoon at Marks Stadium, eking out a 4-3 win.
The No. 7 Women of Troy’s victory over No. 5 Cal is their third victory against top-25 teams, as they swept UCSB on Thursday to go 2-0 for the weekend.
“In the past, we came in knowing we needed to win certain games and that really put a lot of pressure on us,” coach Richard Gallien said. “But, I had a really good feeling about today and we went out there and took care of business.”
USC, now 9-1, recorded another comeback victory on Saturday, falling down 1-0 after dropping the doubles’ point in a hotly contested opening round against the Golden Bears.
“The doubles matches took three years off of my life, but you gotta give it to the girls for their resiliency and their ability to comeback,” Gallien said.
Cal (6-3) was without their top player, No. 3 Jana Juricova, during their recent road trip — they faced UCLA on Friday — and they caught the injury bug again on Saturday after Taylor Davis retired before the second set of her match against junior Danielle Lao. With Lao having already posted a 6-0 win in the first set, Davis and her ankle from the day prior did not seem fit to continue the match.
Despite two out of their top three players suffering injuries, Cal fought hard against the Women of Troy before the depth of USC proved to be too much.
In describing the Golden Bears, Gallien said, “Cal’s a big, strong, athletic team and they can really get after you. We did a good job today fighting back and really going to get it.”
In the decisive match on court five, freshman Gabriella DeSimone took down Cecelia Estlander 7-5, 6-2.
“Gabriella really stepped up when the pressure was on and she really did a good job finishing out the match and pulling out a win for her team,” Gallien said.
On court three and four, freshman Sabrina Santamaria and sophomore Kaitlyn Christian each fell down early in their first sets, but the two members of USC’s top doubles team would lose only one game between them in their last two sets to each score a victory.
Christian had an especially difficult time early on against Annie Goransson, but a three-point swing — including a tiebreaker ace — evened up the match at 3-3 and from there, the scrappy sophomore didn’t look back.
Court one hosted the day’s most exciting match with No. 10 Zoë Scandalis facing off against Cal’s No. 23 Zsofi Susanyi, who replaced Juricova in first singles.
Inspired by her new No. 1 slot, Susanyi had a tight grip throughout the first set, before Scandalis roared back to even the match at 1-1 in the second. With the day already decided, the two played for pride as the final match of the afternoon was won by Susanyi, 6-2, 4-6, 1-0 (10-2).
For the Women of Troy, this win over Cal exorcised some demons that have been lingering these past few years, but more importantly they help put USC in the driver’s seat in the Pac-12.
“A win like this makes the rest of our schedule a bit easier and it really helps us going forward,” Gallien said.
With another matchup against Cal and games against Stanford and UCLA on the horizon, the Women of Troy certainly have their work cut out for them, but as they’ve proved throughout the year, they have a tendency to rise to the occasion.

Similar events unfolded for the USC men’s basketball team yet again.
With about 11 minutes left in the second half, freshman guard Byron Wesley nailed a jump shot to give the Trojans a late 47-45 lead.
But in what has been so common for USC (6-23, 1-15) this season, the shots stopped falling.
Wesley and company failed to register another field goal for the remainder of the contest, eventually stumbling at Arizona State, 56-52, in front of an announced crowd of 6,316 at the Wells Fargo Arena in Tempe.
“It’s our same old story,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We didn’t make ’em. We couldn’t get shots to go down.”
Shooting just 33 percent from the field in the second half, the Trojans fell for the 23rd time this season, breaking a more than two-decade-long program record for losses in a single season. The previous mark was set in 1989 when they finished the year 10-22 overall.
“That’s nothing anybody wants to be associated with,” O’Neill said. “It’s also a situation nobody has had to go through.”
Despite the team’s ineffectiveness on offense in the final 10 minutes of the game, the Trojans still had a chance in the final seconds.
Trailing 53-52 with just under one minute left to play in regulation, Arizona State guard Chris Colvin completed a 3-point play on a drive to the basket.
The acrobatic layup and subsequent free throw gave the Sun Devils (9-20, 5-12) a four-point lead with 19.4 seconds left — a lead they would never relinquish.
Like USC, they too struggled offensively. Colvin’s basket marked the first time they had scored since the 7:45 mark when guard Trent Lockett put back a missed shot attempt.
“I like how we played defensively,” O’Neill said, referencing the final stretch run. “I also like the fact we only had seven turnovers. We got more shots than they did, which is always a plus in a game.”
In the first half, those shots fell, as the Trojans went 11-of-25 from the field and trailed 34-24 at halftime.
But what likely left the strongest impression for the third-year coach was, again, Wesley’s performance. The freshman guard set a career best for the second consecutive game with 22 points on 8-for-14 shooting.  Wesley finished with 18 points on Thursday in a 70-54 loss at Arizona.
“I love how Byron Wesley is developing as a player,” O’Neill said. “He’s become a primetime player.”
Recent results do appear to cement O’Neill’s assertion.
Over the second half of conference play, Wesley has averaged 14.9 points per game — nearly twice as much as the 8.7 points per game he averaged in the nine Pac-12 games.
“He’s becoming a man,” O’Neill said. “He’s fought through a lot of tough situations. He’s embraced coaching. He’s learned how to play hard. He’s physical. This guy is who we thought he was going to be: a big-time player.”
Wesley was aided offensively by sophomore guard Maurice Jones, who finished with 12 points. The two combined for more than 60 percent of the team’s scoring. But Jones wasn’t nearly as efficient, converting four of 13 shot attempts.
The Trojans, who have dropped 15 of their last 16 games since a 24-point home win over TCU on Dec. 19, will conclude the regular season on Thursday and Saturday, as they host Washington and Washington State, respectively, at the Galen Center.
“We’ve not been successful in winning games to the extent we’d like to be, obviously, but I think our guys have played extremely hard for the situation they’re in,” O’Neill said, referencing the fact that only six scholarship players remain healthy enough to play. “I hope they continue to do that the rest of the way.”
USC was narrowly defeated by Washington State earlier this season, 60-53, and lost to Washington 69-41 in Seattle on Feb. 4.
Barring a home sweep of both schools, O’Neill’s bunch will likely enter the Pac-12 tournament the following week on March 7 as the No. 12 seed.

Frustration is natural, but give the Trojans time.
We shouldn’t overreact. But, admittedly, it remains increasingly difficult not to.
We’re watching the USC men’s basketball team amid its worst season in school history.
The 23 losses are a program first. They have won 20 percent of their games, the lowest since the program’s inception. The Trojans have won one game since mid-December, while utilizing a shortened eight-man rotation, including two walk-ons, for much of conference play.
Nothing in that is reassuring that next year will see USC return to the NCAA tournament following four appearances in the Big Dance from 2007-2011. Most Cardinal-and-Gold fans remain understandably aggravated, frustrated and irritated with recent results. If they weren’t, it’d be strange. Nobody likes losing. And nobody likes ugly losing.
“I’m frustrated for the players,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said Saturday. “And I’m frustrated for our fans. I’ve done this for 33 years at many different places and at different levels. Basketball sometimes goes like this.”
The responses have been what you would expect: Just fire the coach. That’s what they say. It sounds easy, painless and something a school like Kentucky might do, should its team be swimming in mediocrity.
“Coaching staff should get the boot,” read one message board post following the Trojans’ latest ordeal — a 56-52 loss at Arizona State on Saturday.
But here’s the thing: USC isn’t Kentucky.
The Trojans haven’t been to the Final Four since Dwight Eisenhower was president. They haven’t won a regular season conference title since 1985. USC basketball is vastly different from USC football.
Recovering from NCAA-levied sanctions is not as seamless as USC football coach Lane Kiffin has made it look on the gridiron.
If you’re looking for an explanation as to why the Trojans have become fixated in the Pac-12 cellar, it’s a rather simple one.
USC has one player, redshirt sophomore forward Evan Smith, from its 2009 recruiting class. Its 2008 class vanished in the aftermath of then-coach Tim Floyd’s resignation three years ago. In short, USC has no recruited junior or senior scholarship players available.  The Trojans lost three starters from last season’s 19-win team in forwards Marcus Simmons and Nikola Vucevic and center Alex Stepheson. They lost five players this season, three of them starters, because of season-ending injuries.
The counterargument remains: O’Neill should have recruited better.
He recruited senior guard Jio Fontan and redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller, two transfer players, but they’ve been in street clothes for much of the season. He recruited a 7-foot center in redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon, but he hasn’t played since Jan. 26 and has worn a splint on his hand, a brace on his left knee and a boot on his right foot at different points this season.
“I’ve never seen a team with that conglomeration of situations and circumstances that have led to where we’re at,” O’Neill said. “It’s not an excuse; it’s a set of circumstances.”
Whatever it is, it certainly explains the Trojans’ current predicament.
NCAA investigations and sanctions are designed to be crippling. The Trojans’ success in football is the exception to the rule. You aren’t supposed to be ranked in the top 10 amid scholarship restrictions and a postseason ban.
No, O’Neill’s team isn’t facing such restrictions now, but back in 2010 the program was, and that lingering cloud over the program in the months before the NCAA released its findings hampered the program.
“It killed recruiting,” O’Neill said, reflecting upon his first season with the program in 2009-2010. “I got the job late, we didn’t self-impose until January, and then we didn’t get the sanctions confirmed until May really handcuffed us for a full year.”
In football, guys will take a chance on USC. After all, the program has produced more NFL draft picks than any school in the country. But such isn’t the case when it comes to basketball. It doesn’t have the same pedigree.
The Trojans start two freshmen, two sophomores and one junior in James Blasczyk, who is a first-year transfer and has been limited because of a stress injury to his right foot. And those players aren’t the one-and-done types you’d see at    top-10 programs. That talent doesn’t typically flock to the Galen Center.
Until USC is a few years removed from its self-imposed sanctions and can field a healthy unit, we won’t be able to fairly evaluate O’Neill, the coaching staff and his personnel.
Is this a coach who can annually lead the Trojans to the NCAA tournament? The top of the Pac-12 pecking order?
I’m guessing he can. A season ago, he took a depth-plagued USC team to the Big Dance. He led Marquette to back-to-back 20-win seasons in the early 1990s. But even at this point, it’s still just endless speculation.
We only know this: As the nightmarish 2012 season comes to a close, O’Neill’s young group needs more time to develop. Evidently, based on recent weeks, it needs a lot of time.

We didn’t make “the big dance”. We made the play-in game, and lost. Our team name wasn’t even on the bracket.
Another Cover KO’s Behind article from the KO-adoring media.
Never ceases to amaze me how people can buy into his line of BS.  The guy has had 20 years to prove he can be a successful college basketball head coach.  He has utterly failed.
Calling this season’s performance “mediocrity” is an assault on the word.  Let’s be clear: it’s a catastrophe.
Yes while Football and Some what Baseball is king at USC MANY things hurt USC Basketball. The fact that hardly no one supports them, Injuries, Recruiting, and so on kills them something has to be done. Starts with on the Court. O’Neal in his 1st and 2nd Year didn’t disapoint. This year they’re playing really bad so what can they do? Recruit Recruit and Recruit Hard. Sell lthe system and Sell USC Basketball and what they can accomplish here.  You gotta work realllly Hard to Build a Basketball program at SC. We may not be Duke, Kentucky, UNC and so on But USC Can do better with Basketball.
Alas, we are the “UCLA football of college basketball”….we need a miracle to rebuild this team.
Your guessing wrong about O’Neill leading them anywhere. You don’t recruit transfer after transfer and build a
solid program even if you get lucky one season. Players not interested in being defense oriented above all
else coming out of high school. The ucla and Arizona schools changed head coaches who were decent including the a fore mentioned Trojan coach to better themselves so what is the USC excuse with a nice arena to draw a crowd. How many fans want to watch a boring contest like the Cal Poly fiasco who beat USC 39 – 36 when the team was at
full strength minus Fontan? That was a complete disgrace to the state of basketball at this level of competition. This thinking would have you happy to have kept Paul Hackett as football coach after three years not to experienced the
great success of Pete Carroll. The bottom line, Basketball is not a major priority with the athletic dept. no matter what they convey to the media .

With eight teams in the Pac-12 separated by three games in the conference standings, each of USC’s remaining games means more than just another potential win.
In their final regular season home game, the Women of Troy (16-11, 10-6) made their Senior Day count with a 59-53 victory over Arizona State (18-10, 9-8).
Winning ways · Senior guard Ashley Corral scored 10 points against Arizona State Saturday. USC has won four straight games. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
In the second half, the Women of Troy trailed by as many as eight points but were able to battle back and to enter the final minute with a five-point advantage courtesy of a fadeaway 3-pointer from the left corner by senior guard Ashley Corral.
Junior forward Christina Marinacci and freshman guard Ariya Crook followed with three free throws each to seal the victory for USC.
In a balanced scoring effort, Marinacci had a team-high 12 points paired with 10 rebounds for a double-double. Corral contributed 10, while sophomore forward Cassie Harberts and freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama each chipped in nine.
USC’s fourth straight win gives the team a one-game advantage over Oregon State (18-9, 9-7) with two games remaining on the schedule.
In third place behind No. 2 Stanford (26-1, 17-0) and California (22-7, 13-4), USC fortified its bid to receive a bye in the Pac-12 tournament in two weeks as one of the top four conference teams.
“We’ve been playing extremely well under pressure, and I’m very happy for that,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We knew we had our hands full because we were fighting for third, and we were very fortunate to get the win today.”
Arizona State maintained a lead through the second half until the Women of Troy tied it up at 38-38 on a layup by Marinacci.
The two teams traded leads three times until an and-one layup by Vaioletama put them up for good with 2:40 left in the game.
USC shot 36 percent from the field but managed to hold an eight-rebound advantage and force 16 turnovers from the Sun Devils.
The Women of Troy jumped out to a quick 11-0 lead while forcing five turnovers. After a scoreless five minutes, the Sun Devils broke the dry spell with a 3-pointer from junior Deja Mann, who led her team with 22 points.
After hitting 14 points, USC stumbled into a scoring drought, making two more shots for the rest of the half. Arizona State, on the other hand, hit five of its next six shots to hold a 24-20 advantage going into halftime.
“Before the game, the coaches told us the meaning of a Trojan. It meant relentless,” senior guard Briana Gilbreath said. “That really showed today. For us seniors, it was our last home game, and we definitely wanted to go out with a bang.”
The Women of Troy will finish the regular season with a two-game road trip to the Washington schools, starting off with a matchup against the Washington Huskies (14-11, 6-9) at 7 p.m. on Thursday.

The Trojans headed to the Bay Area over the weekend looking to end doubts about their ability to perform well on the road and laid those questions to rest.
After defeating No. 11 University of the Pacific in four sets (25-18, 25-23, 28-30, 25-23), on Friday, the Trojan squad stunned top-ranked Stanford 21-25, 25-18, 25-27, 25-16, 15-13, in five hard-fought sets. USC improved its record to 9-4 with a 7-4 record in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play and is on a five-game winning streak.
Upset special · The No. 6 Trojans defeated the Cardinal in Palo Alto in five sets. USC (9-4, 7-4) now sits in fifth place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference, behind UCLA, Stanford, UC Irvine and BYU. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, a National Player of the Year frontrunner, led the Trojans with 17 kills and contributed eight digs against Pacific.  He stepped up against the Cardinal with 28 kills and 11 digs.
The squad’s senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick was crucial in both victories, with .650 and .364 hitting percentages in the two contests. Sophomore outside hitter Tanner Jansen, who had been out for two weeks with an ankle sprain, returned against Stanford and hit .556 with 12 kills and seven digs.
Freshman setter Micah Christenson continued his superb play with 61 assists and a .550 setting rate.
After hitting .172 in their first set loss, 21-25, the Trojans hit .545 in the fifth and deciding set. Even after squandering a 24-22 lead in the third set to go down 1-2, the Trojans pulled through, dominating the fourth set before Ciarelli’s final point in the fifth set completed the upset.
Shandrick had said earlier in the week that out-blocking and taking away the Cardinal’s shots was what the Trojans needed to do to top Stanford. They executed this to near perfection, racking up 15.5 blocks to Stanford’s six and holding the Cardinal to a .264 hitting percentage.
Meanwhile, the Trojans showed their ability to close in the four-set victory on Friday night, winning two very close sets while setting a positive tone for Saturday. Junior opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin had another solid game in his third game back from injury, hitting .355 with 17 kills and five digs. Junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski led the Trojans with 13 digs, and Christenson contributed 55 assists and six digs.
The Trojans have won seven of their last eight games, and improved their road record to 4-3.
The team returns home this week for two games against the University of Hawai’i on March 2 and 4, followed by a non-conference tilt at the Galen Center on March 9 versus Penn State.

Ever wondered what would happen if a family of wealthy Russians in the early 1900s went broke and had to sell the estate they and their servants lived on?
Well, the MFA acting production of The Cherry Orchard at the Scene Dock Theatre can help with that.
The Cherry Orchard is a play by renowned Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, here under the direction of Kate Burton. The translation, by USC’s theatre professor Sharon Carnicke, represents the original text well while updating the script with modern colloquialisms. And unlike many Shakespearean productions, this classic play’s dialogue is modern enough to follow easily, even with its historical context.
The Cherry Orchard tells the story of Madame Lyubov Ranevskaya, the formerly wealthy landowner of a cherry orchard who must put the orchard up for auction to pay off family debts. Lyubov, who previously spent time in Paris with another man, is forced to return home because of financial turmoil. The play then follows Lyubov’s return to her family and her serfs, exploring the relationships she has with these people. Romantic plotlines between the younger folks are thrown in for good measure.
The production features set design by Takeshi Kata that is simple but perfectly representative of Russia in the early 1900s. The stage is set with classic, elegant furniture that looks completely authentic. Images of blossoming cherry orchards are projected onto the walls on each side of the theater — a detail that functions beautifully to bring the audience further into the world of the play and to provide a rich backdrop.
The acting is well executed too, without a single weak performance from any members of the cast. In particular, Lisa Hori-Garcia, who has a lead role as Lyubov, gives an unforgettable performance. Hori-Garcia’s Lyubov goes from smiles to tears in an instant, and she creates such a complex, believable character that it’s hard to take your eyes off her when she’s onstage.
Likewise, Pete Ploszek matches Hori-Garcia with his charisma in his portrayal of the young cynic Peter Trofimov — the former teacher of Lyubov’s now-deceased son — who claims to be “above love.” Some of the most powerful moments happen when these two actors are together on stage, such as their confrontation about the nature of love and moving on. Ploszek’s portrayal of his character’s jaded cynicism is still sweet enough to be compelling, and it provides a great contrast to Hori-Garcia’s passionate, unshaken desire to love and to be loved.
The problem with this play is its pacing, or lack thereof, which seems to be a result of problems in the direction or the interpretation of the script. The Cherry Orchard plays slowly and drags in multiple places: The end of the first act seems to move in slow motion.
Though the second act begins with a new spurt of energy, it again falls into a slowed pace after the big reveal is made about the results of the auction of the estate. Part of the problem is that the direction does not keep the stage energized — much of the play consists of characters sitting around talking, which isn’t too visually stimulating.
The austere staging might also have to do with the original text itself. The Cherry Orchard is not exactly what you call an action-driven play, which makes dynamism on stage difficult.
With a renowned text such as this — we can’t really call out Chekhov on his writing — it is difficult to pinpoint why the play has problems with pacing. And regardless of the original text, there are moments where the direction could have helped to bring the play to life. The Cherry Orchard’s high points come down to the acting, which really revives the play in its lagging moments.
The Cherry Orchard is a worthwhile production but something does not quite come together in making the play lively and compelling to watch. Still, theater fans will want to experience this version of Chekhov’s classic work, if only for the brilliant performances.

If you think about spending a day in Chinatown, perhaps not much more comes to mind than bargain shopping and Chinese food grubbing. But a closer exploration of Chinatown will reveal the unique places that make it much more complex and interesting.
Unexplored · Chinatown entices residents and tourists alike with unknown art galleries and restaurants enclosed in a relaxing atmosphere. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Conveniently close to campus, the area is replete with idiosyncrasies and an overall hipster-meets-ethnic atmosphere. Chinatown might be a tourist attraction for its concentration of Chinese stores and restaurants — not to mention the fact that films like Rush Hour and Starsky and Hutch were shot there — but it has a personality all its own, separate from this surface image. So amble along Chinatown’s streets to come across everything from diverse art to fun boutiques.
Even within the most popular spots of Chinatown lie a few hidden gems, especially in the Central Plaza. The plaza first came to life in 1938, one of the first malls in the United States and the first American Chinatown. Decades later, the plaza serves as a great place to stroll beneath paper lanterns, purchase a fun trinket or sit with a laptop and a cup of coffee.
A smörgåsbord of small stores provides large amounts of surprisingly fun and cheap buys but you can also find more than the typical paper fan to take home as a souvenir. Since 2007, Flock Shop on Broadway Street has provided one-of-a-kind objects for those looking for something not churned out from a factory. From flasks to clothing, it offers neat products made by artists. The store also showcases art; earlier this month the store featured an opening night for artist Alex Chiu that included free ice cream and beer.
If you are hungry but want a more relaxed environment than a packed Chinese restaurant, Via Café on Gin Ling Way offers an alternative atmosphere. The cafe serves Vietnamese food, from egg rolls to noodle soup, but plenty of customers relax at the outdoor tables with a coffee or beer in hand. The cafe is open until 10 p.m. seven days a week and offers free Wi-Fi, making it an alternative study spot of sorts — or at least a different place to battle procrastination.
Chinatown also offers plenty beyond the locales inside the plaza. The area thrives within the context of the arts, providing an art walk for anyone willing to scope out the many galleries, both obvious and hidden. If you walk all the way down to Hill Street, for example, you’ll come across a couple of galleries nestled inside a larger, two-story building.
On the bottom floor is Sam Lee Gallery, a quaint space that you might miss if you weren’t specifically looking for the blue sign above its door. Lee, who received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in art history, has worked in various galleries and now focuses on contemporary art. The current exhibition, Tennis Courts, showcases the photography of Los Angeles-based artist Frick Byers and runs until the end of March. The small gallery proves welcoming and easy to walk through, and Lee might be on hand to greet you and to offer his expertise.
Upstairs, you will discover L2kcontemporary, another hidden space that proves equally friendly. The gallery currently displays Jim Keville’s Fetish Feel, an exploration of the act of creating. The artist sculpted the shape of the grip of his hand, creating small ceramic sculptures with varied painted surfaces. There are plenty of other galleries around the area, and you can check ChinaTownLA.com to see a list of the galleries and their websites for opening reception dates.
The Undiscovered Chinatown Walking Tour provides a more guided exploration of Chinatown. The tour takes place every first Saturday of the month from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and costs $20 for adults — RSVP required.
Whether you pay for a tour or create your own, Chinatown offers plenty to anyone willing to roam its streets. ChinaTownLA.com contains a list of all the businesses in the area so you can plan out your day. Without spending a lot of money, you can take advantage of the relaxing, quirky atmosphere. The area provides a getaway from typical L.A. sights, an alternative space for an inevitably interesting day or night.

This year’s Oscar nominees for best animated film include Kung Fu Panda 2, Rango and some French flick about a cat. Japanese anime films, however, have been absent since 2005’s nomination for Hayao Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle. Meanwhile, Spirited Away remains the only Japanese film to have won the award since its creation in 2001.
It’s our loss. American animation has amazing works like The Incredibles and Beauty and the Beast, but it retains a belief that feature-length animated films are for children by default. In Japan, directors make animated films for all ages, and have no reason to use kid gloves with violence and dark themes. More so, these films go unknown in America outside of anime clubs.
Plenty of anime films have made their mark as stirring pieces of storytelling. Here are a few lesser-known gems.
Akira (1988)
Akira is the H.P. Lovecraft of the anime world — it inspired pretty much every sci-fi film after it.
Set in dystopian Neo-Tokyo, a delinquent biker gang roves the streets and causes trouble. The plot thickens when the government captures the angry teenager Tetsuo and discovers he has psychic powers similar to those that destroyed the first Tokyo. The film takes a visceral look at corruption, maturity and the reactions to a nuclear holocaust.
Akira appears dated in its style, and elements of its story have become tropes in anime, but it’s fascinating to see one of the chief influences of anime.
Porco Rosso (1992)
Hayao Miyazaki, considered the Walt Disney of Japan, has made his mark with films like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. Porco Rosso remains one of his more obscure works but undeservedly so.
Set after World War I, an Italian fighter pilot freelances by battling pirates with guns and witty repartee. The catch is he bears a curse — the head of a pig. The film has more overt political undertones than Miyazaki’s other works and that makes it interesting. It also features an American villain, which might account for its lack of American theatrical distribution.
Regardless, it’s full of Miyazaki’s gentle charisma and unsentimental sweetness.
Millennium Actress (2001)
People who dislike typical romance stories should check this out. Millennium Actress contains many stories within a story. Its outermost layer follows a small film crew as they interview an old, reclusive actress. She tells her story from her teenage years, before World War II, to her sudden departure from the film world. Within that, her life story is reflected in her films — the audience and film crew jump from ninja fights in feudal Japan to desperate voyages to outer space, sometimes not knowing if they are watching her life or her films. The actress’ motivation comes from a one-time meeting with a young rebel, and her illustrious film career is only a side effect of her lovelorn search.
Millennium Actress is an ode to film storytelling — it sweeps from action to romance to keening sadness but remains a beautiful ride. Just remember your hankies.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2001)
Anime has its tropes and flaws like any genre. Though many people think of objectified females and absurd physics, another annoyance is devolution into torrid melodrama.
Japanese films and series can get very dark, but tend to jump from happy-silly cuteness to soul-crushing, puppy-kicking tragedy without much middle ground. The best anime avoids this conceit, but the standard remains in many series.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust crafts a surreal, gray story set in a future where vampires fight bounty hunters. D — half-human, half-vampire and all stoic badassery — is hired to track down a young woman abducted by a vampire noble. Bloodlust surpasses the tepid first film and stands on its own. Alongside gorgeous artwork, the story is a wavering shade of gray that embraces the dark, romantic trapping of vampires, without turning it into a silly love story or a cheap harlequin tragedy.
Sword of the Stranger (2007)
Anime and samurai go together like elves and archery, but Sword of the Stranger makes a name for itself among the scores of feudal Japan stories.
The film has several layers despite its simple premise: a boy on the run from the Ming Dynasty; a quiet ronin who refuses to draw his sword; and a Westerner swordsman obsessed with finding a worthy opponent. The fight scenes are some of the best in animation, with a painstaking fluidity that never takes glossy shortcuts. Equally fascinating are the interactions between the Japanese and Chinese characters.
Though not well-known outside anime circles, it’s a must-see film.

Sleigh Bells’ sophomore album is a Reign of Terror in and of itself.
If you are the kind of person who is interested in repetition — the same heavy riffs, the same vocal stylings, the same depressingly vapid tunes — then Sleigh Bells’ newest album is right up your alley.
Hip sound · Sleigh Bells is composed of Derek E. Miller (left) and Alexis Krauss (right). The duo has garnered accolades for their blend of noise and power pop, especially on its 2010 studio debut album Treats. - Photo courtesy of Patrick Odell
Though the apocalyptic theme of the album suits the style of music that Sleigh Bells has created, the record is executed in such a strange way that it’s hard to praise the album for much of anything at all. Fans of Treats, be warned: Reign of Terror drowns out all the fun and excitement of the noise-pop fans grew to love on the first record and replaces it with a bland, incoherent disarray of noise.
A few tracks on the album are reminiscent of bands gone bad. “D.O.A.” plays like a depressed pop cover of a Rage Against the Machine song; similarly, “Road to Hell” brings about visions of Britney Spears from the Blackout sessions gone bad.
But before you cross Reign of Terror off of the iTunes wish list, there are a few impressive things to note about this album.
“Born to Lose,” the first single of the album, welcomes back that juxtaposition of lead singer Alexis Krauss’ airy vocals against the crazy hard riffs that make Sleigh Bells’ music such an intriguing specimen in the first place.
Even here, the track immediately initiates a change in sound from Treats. That candy-like effervescence is gone and the thrill factor of hearing Sleigh Bells’ unique sound seems to have lost some of its appeal.
The band also gives its listeners a taste of a new noise-pop opus: the stadium sing-along anthem with “Crush.” Thankfully, the song sounds more like something off of Treats. Yes, there are repetitive lyrics and chords, but it brings back the life and fun that Sleigh Bells so effortlessly created on their first album.
The final two genuinely intriguing songs on Reign of Terror come in the middle of the album. “Comeback Kid,” the standout track of the album, packs that good ol’ Sleigh Bells punch and vigor. The single exudes pop-starlet sass mixed with grunge-rock swagger. The track is catchy, anthemic and motivational — all the elements for a rocking pop tune.
“Demons” creeps onto the scene with ghastly wails and hard-horror pop angst; the tune sounds like its being belted out by a demonic cheer squad, Jennifer’s Body -style. The octave progression on the repetition of “Take it down / Take it down” is utterly amazing, and the chorus makes you want to go ghostbusting.
But then there’s the rest of the album, which is lifeless and almost impossible to listen to.
It’s obvious that the band is trying to “mature,” as all bands feel they must, with more explicit and philosophical content to show their progression as artists. But there’s maturing because it’s the natural order of things, and then there’s maturing for the sake of maturing.
It’s regretful to say that Sleigh Bells is the kind of band that should stick to what it’s good at doing.
Tracks such as “End of the Line” and “Leader of the Pack” fall short of the mark. The lyrics are blunt and uninteresting, and the production is detrimentally subdued. At times, it sounds like the band is trying to capture some romanticized version of noise pop with harmonic strings and orchestral music.
It’s difficult to hold a band to certain standards because individual taste matters so much. But when Sleigh Bells pulls a 180 and changes its entire sound, there’s reason to start crying out for the old.
The duo has taken its mindless, rock/pop jams and attempted to inject them with startling lyrical content. The end result is a mess: There are a couple of songs that progress the brilliance found on Treats, but the remaining tracks come off as failed attempts at artistry.
Sleigh Bells seemed to have it figured out on their first album. Its follow-up could have been an amped up vocal/guitar affair poised to break the boundaries of noise pop. Instead, Reign of Terror plays like a broken record: repetitive and harsh to listen to.
It seems a few tracks — and those bloody shoes on the album cover — are all that’s left of those Treats cheerleaders who brought so much joy just two years ago.

Affirmative action is a loaded term: Bring it up in any conversation, and you’re bound to elicit a strong opinion or two.
Its use — which generally refers to policies that take race, religion, gender or sexual orientation into consideration — is one of the most debated topics today, particularly in the realm of college admissions.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a case involving the use of affirmative action at the University of Texas, where a white student claimed that the university denied her admission based on her race.
If the justices decide to overturn the use of affirmative action, the outcome of the case could eliminate diversity as justification for considering race in admission.
But the case only shows one side of the picture.
In California, the use of affirmative action in the college admissions process was banned in 1996, although the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is currently considering whether to lift the state’s ban because of a drop in diversity.
The affirmative action controversy ultimately clouds the college admissions process. It  serves to confuse students and detract from the true meaning of applying for college: showing one’s best self.
Supporters of affirmative action argue that it is necessary to maintain and promote diversity on college campuses. They also believe it helps reduce racial and ethnic tensions and stereotypes and prevent discrimination.
Opponents of affirmative action maintain that it leads to reverse discrimination, lower standards of accountability and detraction from genuine minority achievement.
In another controversial affirmative action case, an Asian-American student with a perfect SAT score complained that he was denied admission to Harvard University based on reverse discrimination bias.
The University of Texas and Harvard University cases leave some people wondering: Overall, what kind of candidates were these students? Did they have rich high school experiences? What were they passionate about? What did they use to differentiate themselves, aside from their grades and test scores?
Without downplaying the importance of race, it is important to note that race is not the only measure of diversity, nor should it be a deciding factor in the admissions process.
It’s difficult to draw a direct correlation between race and a student’s ability to get into a top-tier university.
There’s the compounding effect of race and income, the influence of a student’s household environment and how invested his or her parents are in education, along with a host of other demographic, economic, geographic and social factors.
The college admissions process should be about matching students’ individual passions, talents and academic interests with a university that’s the right fit.
On Oct. 20 2011, Adam Liptak, Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times, brought a refreshing and pragmatic view to the table.
“From the applicant’s perspective, I don’t think very much would change,” Liptak said in an article. “Applicants would continue to try to demonstrate that they would be strong and interesting students, highlighting their achievements and the ways in which they could contribute to a vibrant intellectual community.”
No matter how the affirmative action cases play out in court, students should continue to focus on their strengths and interests and to support each other in their academic endeavors.
Ultimately, what the courts and college admissions officers decide is out of students’ control.
In the face of change and ambiguity, students can best react by taking ownership of their success. Whether that means acting in a school play or learning a new language, students can develop and nurture their interests in a variety of ways.
The college admissions process is only getting more competitive. Students can best differentiate themselves from other applicants by broadening their interests and passions through meaningful experiences.
Looking toward the future, I hope that race won’t be a factor in the admissions process. But as of now, it certainly won’t hurt for students to focus on what lies within their scope of control, rather than getting tied up in the heat of the issue.

Centuries of wealth and privilege?  Yeah, I don’t think you know anything about the poverty and starvation my people came from.  Africans in America are behind because (among other handicaps) the African-American IQ bell curve is 15 points to the left of the white American IQ bell curve.  But whites can’t ever be complacent, their bell curve is 3 points to the left of East Asians and 10 points to the left of Ashkenazic Jews. That’s all tested reality.  Every individual should be judged on his or her own merits, but the idea of affirmative action lifting an entire class of people beyond their natural abilities is ridiculous, unjust, and has been rejected every time it’s been on a ballot.
UC Berkeley (UCB) pulls back access and affordability to instate Californians. Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau displaces Californians qualified for public Cal. with a $50,600 payment from born abroad foreign and out of state affluent students.  And, foreign and out of state tuition is subsidized in the guise of diversity while instate tuition/fees are doubled.
UCB is not increasing enrollment. Birgeneau accepts $50,600 foreign students and displaces qualified instate Californians (When depreciation of Calif. funded assets are included (as they should be), out of state and foreign tuition is more than $100,000 + and does NOT subsidize instate tuition). Like Coaches, Chancellors Who Do Not Measure-Up Must Go. 
More recently, Chancellor Birgeneau’s campus police deployed violent baton jabs on Cal. students protesting Birgeneau’s tuition increases. The sky will not fall when Birgeneau and his $450,000 salary are ousted. Opinions make a difference; email UC Board of Regents   
The idea that people can be selected “purely” on merit, as one commenter above seems to suggest, is simply not realistic. Why would purely objective merit criteria give a complete lack of ethnic diversity? That just doesn’t make sense. The systems are subjective, and the discussion here is about which subjective criteria can be used and which can’t.

The author of this article really did not bring anything to the discussion of racism and AA as it pertains to the admissions process. If all you are saying to students is IGNORE policies that determine how a student will be accepted — that is just plain “stick your head in the sand” dumb. If we really want diversity everywhere- do you ever stop and wonder why we do not have AA as it pertains to college level and pro-sports? It is because we want the best of the best to compete and not just the most politically correct looking bench. Even a child would be able to see how dishonest a team would look like if it was not composed of the best on their merits but also on their race. I also have a quote that resonates with me about race.
““There is another class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs, partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.”… Booker T. Washington …1904”
A child is ignorant to how America has treated non-white peoples of this world and how disenfranchised people of color/indigenous peoples have become today.
Fighting racism with racism will not solve the problem. 
If wealth and privilege are truly the indicators of the head start “white straight dudes” had, then college admissions considering socioeconomic status would be more beneficial. Race-based admissions hurt everyone.
I just realized that’s a hell of a long comment….if its too long for anyone, the quote at the bottom of the comment will suffice my point. Peace.
Jasmine, thanks a lot for bringing more exposure on this important issue. It’s definitely an issue that needs to be looked at from the root and in a holistic manner. People need to realize that the genuine rewards and treasures of this nation (institutions like property ownership, public office, higher education) were meant for at one point “free white persons” and while its bollocks for people to think affirmative action (AA) is a means of “reparation” – it should certainly be used ensure diversity and advance the education opportunities, not of an individual, but of a minority demographic (such as LGBT, people of color, disability), to advance the possibilities of them prospering at the highest levels of education. Education is widely seen as a vehicle that allows for upward mobility in America’s socio-economic ladder and what we are seeing in the U.S. right now is people of color (particularly Black Americans and Latin@s, Native Americans) not showing their true numerical and academic potential in colleges. Now, of course all kinds of people dismiss AA, but the majority of people (whom I’ve encountered) who oppose AA are white Americans. They call it the usual names of “reverse racism” and say it deviates from what a person should solely be measured on – their merit. However, we live in a pigmentocracy where race and your skin color is role that defines your circumstances at times because institutional racism exists? Proof? Look up terms like: racial profiling, demographics in jails/prisons versus demographics in colleges, number of minorities in military, and number of people serving as conglomerate CEO’s and Fortune 500 companies. When a minority does not have the $ and is still just as qualified as their “dominant” counterpart (white people), the preference should be given to minorities since this country was built and became the self proclaimed “sole remaining superpower”  by having slavery, terminating millions of the indigenous peoples of this land, taking away this land from a sovereign nation, and state sanctioning racist institutions like slavery, Chinese Exclusion, Japanese interment, Trail of Dreams, 1930’s deportation of Mex-Am citizens, and currently xenophobic laws against people w/out papers (who happen to be people of color and minorities). AA will not make America alleviate the white guilt nor will it solve major problems, but it will work to close the gap in an area of life where education was only meant for wealthy white individuals. Finally, I end with this quote. Peace. 
“The only way you can truly complain about Affirmative Action is if you ignore historical context—if you ignore a society that was built from the ground up on discrimination. People love to use sports metaphors like “Oh, it’s not fair! If this was a race…” If this was an actual race, the way you would look at it is that white straight dudes got to start running about four hundred years ago. Everyone else, slowed down by their slave chains and their vaginas, which are apparently very heavy, weren’t allowed to run. Now these things are being put into place so that they have a fighting chance against centuries long lines of wealth and privilege.”

Who isn’t afraid of the freshman 15?
Of all the myths of college life, this supposed weight gain haunts university freshmen most when they step onto campus.
It drives students to go to the Lyon Center every day or buy salads at Seeds Marketplace instead of orange chicken at Panda Express.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Generally, maintaining a normal weight is a healthy lifestyle choice. The conversation on healthy weight, however, tends to ignore the other end of the spectrum: obsessiveness about food.
Almost 10 percent of college-age women have a clinical or near-clinical eating disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. That is no small number, but somehow, anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders still aren’t talked about freely on college campuses.
Eating disorders include anorexia (not eating), bulimia (binging, purging and laxative and diuretic use) or some combination of the signs and symptoms of anorexia, bulimia, and/or binge eating disorder.  Just one or two of these behaviors might not be considered a full syndrome eating disorder, but they can still be physically dangerous and emotionally draining.
All eating disorders require professional help. Community support is also important. The lack of conversation doesn’t make sense when one considers that an October 2011 University of Cincinnati study showed that 50 percent of college students know someone with an eating disorder.
Students need to start being advocates for their own health and for the health of their friends. We need to start talking to each other about our concerns.
Eating disorders are often ignored because of the sensitivity and confusion surrounding the issue. For example, it’s hard to criticize someone for being too thin when they can frame it as an issue of trying to be healthy.
What’s the difference between healthy and “too healthy”?
Lady Gaga recently opened up to the media about her battle with bulimia in high school — and how she only stopped because she realized the purging was ruining her vocal chords.
There are other consequences. For example, constant purging can cause severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which can result in cardiac arrest or seizures. Anorexia leads to malnutrition and therefore myriad related health issues.
Deciding whether to confront a friend can be difficult. Many people worry about losing that friend or creating awkwardness in the relationship; there is a fine line between being concerned and interfering.
So what can we do to navigate these issues on campus?
Make yourself a role model. If you see a friend in need, sit down and express your concerns without being accusatory. That friend might open up to you if he or she feels ready.
Just like you wouldn’t hesitate to tell your friend that he or she might have an alcohol or drug problem, don’t be afraid to address a friend’s eating habits as a matter that jeopardizes his or her health.
Still, if you feel uncomfortable approaching someone, you have other options.
Trojans Care for Trojans is an anonymous texting and calling hotline for people who want to help a friend in need but aren’t sure how to provide support. TC4T helps mobilize campus resources to approach a variety of situations. If you have a friend you feel would benefit from an anonymous tip, TC4T might be an appropriate step.
In addition, talk therapy, nutritional skill building and medical care are available on and off campus. Books dealing with various eating disorders can be found at the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion.
As a community, USC students do a great job of encouraging each other to stay physically fit. We also need to encourage each other to be well — this includes communicating our concerns about disordered eating.
