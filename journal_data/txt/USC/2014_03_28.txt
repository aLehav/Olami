The last weekend of March only comes with two major nationwide releases: Biblical epic Noah, featuring a star-studded cast led by Russell Crowe and Emma Watson, and Sabotage, featuring ex-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in yet another action role. While both films should do well at the box office this weekend, expect Noah to claim the number one spot.
Noah is a reimagining of the Biblical story about a man who must make an ark before the great flood washes over the Earth. As can be expected of Biblical films, Noah was hit with waves of criticism from religious groups. Darren Aronofsky, who also directed Black Swan, maintains that it is not a perfect adaptation of the story and utilizes a lot of creative freedom. While the film did face some issues during the screening process, it has been generally well received by critics. The cast of Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins, among others, should be enough to draw moviegoers.
Sabotage tells the tale of a team of DEA agents that successfully raids one of the world’s deadliest drug cartels. In a manner reminiscent of Agatha Christie’s And Then There Were None, the agents start to be killed one by one. While Schwarzenegger is an action icon and celebrity of the highest order, his last few films, such as Escape Plan and The Last Stand, have been major box office flops, grossing only $25.13M and $12.05M, respectively. To many moviegoers, he is no longer a relevant action star. While he still may be able to draw audiences, this film should only draw small audiences.
Last week’s frontrunner, Divergent, an adaptation of a young adult series that has drawn many comparisons to The Hunger Games franchise, didn’t have as successful as opening weekend and received mixed reviews. While it should remain at the higher end of the box office this weekend, expect it to be easily overtaken by Noah.

I’ve caught a bug, a country bug.
As a native southern California girl, I grew up exposed to various cultures and music, but I could never get into country-pop artists like Taylor Swift and Shania Twain, until recently. Now, here I am blasting Luke Bryan while sipping on the fabulous sweet tea that my roommate made, craving a cold brew on a Friday night and looking for buttermilk baked chicken recipes – a healthier alternative to buttermilk fried chicken.

If you are from the south, I apologize for my lack of knowledge. I understand that these foods are not incredibly country, but I am willing to learn the ways and become country-cultured.
Some of my favorite southern treat recipes come from some of my favorite bloggers, although some of them might be a little more Southern California, but they’ll get you rocking your cowboy boots and blaring some country tunes as you fill your college kitchen with good eats.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and one of my favorites, the Pioneer Woman, has the best recipe for homemade drop biscuits and gravy to start your morning off right.
For lunch, the only thing I can say about Eat Yourself Skinny’s The Best Turkey Chili You’ll Ever Taste is, “Man! I feel like a woman.”
When it comes to snacks, I don’t have a clue what people snack out in the south. My thoughts immediately venture to old country westerns, so I think of chewing tobacco, beef jerky and cans of peaches – or maybe that’s just a throwback to the movie “Holes” with Shia Labeouf. Either way, my favorite trail mix, Slow Cooker Monday Granola by 52 Kitchen Adventures, has a southern feel.
What appetizers do people in the south eat? In honor of savory southern hors d’oeuvres here is another Jalapeño Popper recipe by Deep Dish South – I might be obsessed with bacon, cheese and flaming hot peppers. Learn to love it.
While my quest for buttermilk baked chicken is still underway, I found a fabulously crispy recipe for buttermilk-fried chicken by the Brown Eyed Baker. What caught my eye about this recipe in particular was her intro before actually talking about the importance of fried chicken when she was doing her undergraduate studies – props to her because now I am sharing her treasured recipe with a bunch of college kids.
Finally we get to dessert. There is nothing more country to me than Peach Cobbler and when made correctly, the cobbler should melt in your mouth with vanilla ice cream melting on top of it – just thinking about it makes my mouth water. This decadent peach cobbler recipe from My Baking Addiction won’t disappoint.
I’m probably missing some key southern treats and elements, but don’t fret ! I’m working on my knowledge – that’s what cookbooks are for. At the moment I’m trying to separate creole from bayou and Texas from Kentucky. I have much to learn but at least the journey is tasty.

Gen David Petraeus said his tenure as commanding general in Iraq and director of the CIA included countless sleepless nights, catching a stray bullet in the chest and even a mountain bike race against former President George W. Bush.
Gen. Ed. · David Petraeus, a USC Judge Widney Professor, talks to students on Tuesday about his experiences serving as commander general of the Iraq forces and CIA director. – Tom Queally | Daily Trojan
Petraeus, a USC Judge Widney Professor, gave leadership advice and described his experience working in the upper echelon of government services in a lecture he gave in MDA 325, “Case Studies in Modern Leadership,” on Tuesday.
The class, taught by Dan Schnur and Bill Simon, includes guest lectures by prominent figures in politics, business and the media.
Petraeus spoke of how his experience as the commanding general in Iraq shaped his understanding of leadership, starting from the moment he was given the job.
“I basically went to the White House for a meeting and came out with a new job,” Petraeus said of being appointed the commanding general of U.S. troops in Iraq by Bush.
Though leading U.S. soldiers in Iraq was both grueling and emotionally draining, Petraeus said he counts the experience among his most valuable.
“You cannot imagine anything more awesome on a good day, but there aren’t many good days. We had a few good days,” he said. “A good day was no casualties and also no Iraqi casualties.”
Petraeus said the deaths of U.S. soldiers took an emotional toll on him even when he did not know them personally. He was also injured during his time in the military in what he called a “freak accident” when he was hit by a stray bullet shot by one of his own soldiers.
The general also said that the complexity of his job made it especially draining. Petraeus envisioned the military working differently than previous operations. When a soldier asked him if he saw the World War II general Douglas MacArthur as a role model, Petraeus explained that his vision more closely aligned with Rudy Giuliani’s strategy as mayor of New York City.
“I think of Rudy Giuliani trying to patch broken windows in New York. And that’s sort of the way we looked at it,” Petraeus said. “The idea is if you fix the broken window, it doesn’t turn into the derelict building that turns into the crack house that destroys the neighborhood. You have got to stop that early on.”
His role in Iraq, Petraeus said, focused on more than traditional combat — U.S. troops were rebuilding communities, patching roads and repairing schools. He hoped their efforts could help Iraqi citizens feel more secure in their homes, and turn the tide of violence in the country.
“There is nothing easy about it, but there is also no greater privilege,” he said of serving in the military.
Petraeus’ string of positions spanned two presidencies: Bush’s and President Barack Obama’s. Asked to describe the differences between the two presidents, Petraeus called the comparison “apples and oranges.”
He spoke highly of both presidents, praising Obama’s exhaustive decision-making process and Bush’s resolve in difficult situations. Petraeus has even gone mountain biking with Bush and said that even though he rode the president’s tail the whole ride, “the president always finishes first.”
Petraeus said he admires both presidents for the difficulty of their job, noting that the wealth of factors both Bush and Obama had to consider complicated their decisions.
“You can’t divorce the battlefield from Capitol Hill politics, coalition politics, the fiscal deficit,” he said. “You name it, there are factors that [the president] has to grapple with. In his decision-making equation, those are factors. In mine, they are informing, but not driving, factors.”
Regardless of the industry or field, Petraeus said everyone from world leaders to CEOs to aspiring entrepreneurs has to focus on the “big ideas” in order to effect change.
“If you don’t get big ideas right, you don’t get Facebook, you don’t get Google,” he said. “These are all built on big ideas. In Iraq, the surge that mattered most was the surge of ideas, not the surge of forces. Big ideas don’t hit you on the head like Newton’s apple if you stand under the right tree. Big ideas are hard.”
The general also said he learned the value of cooperation in his positions of leadership, noting that “no one of us is smarter than all of us together.” In Iraq, when his team drafted the counter-insurgency manual for U.S. troops, Petraeus said the most effective meetings he had included journalists, intellectuals and experts in addition to military officers.
Though he looked back on his career fondly, Petraeus also said his high-ranking positions showed him how lonely being a leader can be.
“The truth is you don’t have anybody to talk to, actually … At the end of the day, there is one commander or one leader and that is you,” Petraeus said. “There are really no peers in those situations.”
