NBC News and Wall Street Journal pollster Peter Hart sat down with political science professor Bob Shrum to discuss polls and campaign data in the modern political landscape at Mudd Hall on Wednesday. 
The event is part of the Political Conversations series sponsored by the department of political science at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Shrum began by discussing Hart’s career in political polls, citing  technological change as a major force in how polls are conducted.
“When I started in the business, polling was done door-to-door, and that was in 1964,” Hart said. “I worked for a man named Lou Harris … He was the pollster for John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was the first U.S. candidate to use polling in a major way.” 
Hart explained that polling was done very differently when he began his career. Pollsters mailed the interviews and had to send in the responses over the phone, so results took around seven days to come out, according to Hart.
“Telephone polling is the main way we have been doing polling for the last 30 years,” Hart said.
Hart also commented on the new era of internet polling and the way unanimous electronic sources have lost their face-to-face appeal of earlier methods.
“It’s instantaneous, it’s much cheaper, but what is the disadvantage? It is not a sample,” Hart said. “If I took all the bottles of wine from the liquor store down the block and pour it all together, do you think that is going to be a better bottle of wine or worse bottle of wine? But now when we do polling we just say, mix them all in it doesn’t make any difference.”
Discussing the current elections, Hart pointed out public relations issues on both sides of the aisle. For Hart, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lacks honesty and openness, while Republican presidential nominee Trump lacks qualifications..
“This is a change election,” Hart said. “The American public has figured out they do not want Donald Trump as president.” 
According to Hart, recent NBC News and Wall Street Journal polls measure voters’ perception of the candidate’s temperament, the candidate’s honesty and the candidate’s experience.
“When it comes to Donald Trump, over 50 percent of the voters said he did not have the right temperament. When it came to being honest and straightforward, they were very divided and finally, when it came to being knowledgeable and experienced, over 50 percent did not feel that way about him,” Hart said.
As for Clinton, 60 percent of voters did not believe the candidate is honest, according to Hart.
“The voters have decided they do not want Donald Trump. What they haven’t figured out is if whether they can live with Hillary Clinton,” Hart said. “She is trying to break the glass ceiling. The voters are trying to break a glass curtain.”
Jordan Elist, a senior majoring in business administration and international relations, was thankful for the opportunity to hear from Hart and his stance on the change election.
“I think it is always an incredible opportunity to hear from a prominent pollster,” Elist said. “I was also surprised to hear that this is more of a change election as opposed to a continuation election. With Obama’s approval rating at 55 percent, you would think voters would want more of the same.”

Photo courtesy of USC NewsA dog’s life · Beau, a two-and-a-half year old Goldendoodle, is a permanent member of the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion.
There’s one professor at USC who will not be assigning any homework, quizzes or finals, and whose approval you can gain with cuddles. To sign up for his class, just visit the Engemann Student Health Center and ask for Professor Beauregard Tirebiter.
Professor Beauregard Tirebiter, or “Beau” for short, is a two-year-old hypoallergenic Goldendoodle. As the issues of academic stress, depression and suicide prevention have gained traction on college campuses nationwide, universities have begun to recognize the importance of mental health care for students. Keeping the students’ emotional health in mind, USC has become the first university in the country to obtain a full-time facility dog. 
“Beauregard” means “handsome gaze” in French; this name not only recognizes his French background, but also refers to his very soft and sweet eyes, as people are always commenting on how his beautiful gaze resembles that of a human. The second part of his name, Tirebiter, pays homage to USC’s former mascot, George Tirebiter. 
Beau earned his credentials as a facility dog after extensive training with Canine Angels Service Teams in Oregon. His handler Amanda Vanni, a health promotion specialist in the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion, said that his title as a facility dog differentiates him from a therapy dog. 
“Beau was trained to work with all students in an educational setting,” Vanni said. “This distinguishes him from therapy dogs, as they work in more individualized settings with a counselor under more sporadic visits.”
Beau will initially hold office hours in the OWHP Student Wellness Lounge, located in the Engemann Student Health Center, available to interact with everyone who stops by. Vanni said that once he gets fully acclimated, she plans on taking him to different residence halls and events around campus. 
“We hope that students will come to recognize him and feel a similar connection to him as they do to their own pets at home,” Vanni said. 
Recent research has shown that dogs often have an almost immediate connection with strangers, making them helpful as therapy animals that can interact with a wide variety of students each day. Furthermore, additional studies have shown that dogs can help lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, reduce rates of asthma and even increase the ability to socialize in the people that interact with them. 
“Dogs help relieve stress simply by [students] petting them,” said CarolAnn Peterson, an adjunct professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. “Since new, incoming students would have a lot of stress, some place that is safe and soothing would certainly be welcome.” 
Kirsten Briggs, a freshman majoring in civil engineering, said that she looked forward to seeing how Beau could help students cope with the difficulty of moving away from home. 
“I think a dog on campus will definitely bring an element of additional happiness to this environment,” Briggs said. “I miss my dog from home very much, so seeing Beau around will definitely lift my spirits and be very comforting. It will help me if I ever get homesick, and it will create a larger sense of community.”
Sarah-Doe Osborne, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, said that she’s looking forward to seeing how Beau’s presence will affect campus because of her previous experience with animal therapy and its effect on young people. 
“I worked with disabled children and noticed that [horse therapy] served as a huge mood booster and helped the kids come out of their shells,” Osborne said. “Working with animals releases endorphins that help people relax and encourages them to socialize. Besides helping with motor coordination, the horses gave patients incentives to work harder on their homework assignments and something to look forward to.” 
While Beau is currently the only full-time facilities dog on any college campus, Vanni said that she is excited to share what she learns with other campuses that might be interested in pursuing something similar.
Beau’s arrival on campus was made possible by a donation dedicated to student wellness from the Trojan League of Los Angeles. Students are encouraged to follow him on Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat at @Beau_USC, or to visit him in Suite 203 of the Engemann Student Health Center from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays and 1-3 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The No. 2 water polo team takes an undefeated record north for their own Weekender when they face No. 5 Stanford in Palo Alto on Saturday. The game marks the first MPSF match for both teams this year.
Leading the Trojans (5-0, 0-0) into the fray is head coach Jovan Vavic, who coaches both the men’s and women’s team at USC. With a win on Saturday, Vavic will earn his 500th win as the men’s head coach.
Last week, the Trojans earned three wins and outscored their opponents 67-7, including a 14-3 win over No. 6 UC Santa Barbara at home. The wins were highlighted by junior goalie McQuin Baron, who tallied 16 saves and a defense that shut out the Gauchos in the first and third periods.
Offensively, the Trojans were led in the game by junior driver Matteo Morelli and junior two-meter Lachlan Edwards who scored three goals apiece. Morelli and Edwards are the Trojans’ leading goal-scorers with 13 and 12, respectively, five games into the season.
Stanford has started its season off strong due in part to the goaltending of sophomore Oliver Lewis who is averaging 10.3 saves per game while allowing only 4.3 goals per game. 
USC and Stanford have a strong history of competitive matchups with the Trojans leading the all-time series 62-60. Last year, the two teams faced each other four times, with the Men of Troy winning three of those games. After losing their first game against the Cardinal, USC won the next three games against Stanford.
The game begins at 1 p.m. and will be televised on Pac-12 Network Los Angeles.

It may not have happened exactly how Clay Helton would have liked, but through two games, USC is exactly where everyone anticipated it would be after a deflating loss to top-ranked Alabama to start the year followed by a blowout home win against Utah State in week two.
Now, the season can really begin for the Trojans — and not just because Saturday’s tilt at No. 7 Stanford is the first conference game on the docket.
This was perhaps the worst possible year that USC could have scheduled Alabama to kick off the season. With a rookie head coach and a new quarterback, the Trojans needed two Utah State-like matchups — instead of just one — to give them enough reps and build chemistry before Pac-12 play without the threat of an early-season loss.
Instead, Helton and redshirt junior and first-year starting quarterback Max Browne were thrown into the fire in Arlington, and it was clear that they did not belong on the same field as Alabama head coach Nick Saban’s team. As a result, before the second week of the season, the Trojans were already discouraged and searching for answers, dropping out of the rankings so far that even a convincing win the following week didn’t earn them a single vote in either the AP Top 25 or the Coaches Poll.
In fact, no team in the Pac-12 South Division is ranked, but every other team except Arizona received votes in the AP Top 25 this week. Utah, which played Southern Utah its first week and barely scraped by BYU last Saturday, received 62 votes, tied for the most among teams not in the top 25. UCLA has an identical record to USC — the Bruins lost to Texas A&M to open the season before defeating UNLV in week two — but somehow received 47 votes. And just because Colorado and Arizona State took advantage of far inferior opponents to start the campaign, they were each rewarded with at least one vote. 
If any of those teams had Alabama on its schedule the first week, I’m sure they would not have received a single vote (I’m looking specifically at UCLA, which 47 voters thought was deserving of being one of the top 25 teams in the country, despite losing a game the first week that it should’ve won, while no one felt the same for USC despite the Trojans expectedly falling to a better opponent).
To be clear, this is not a pity party for the Trojans. They were ranked No. 20 in the preseason, and they had an opportunity that no other Pac-12 team did — to upset the No. 1-ranked team and probably leapfrog into the top 10 by week two. But they didn’t. They lost, and they lost big, and the voters are making them pay for it.
Still, record-wise, with the Trojans exactly where we’d thought they’d be after two games, the real evaluation begins now. Which team shows up in Palo Alto on Saturday — the team that looked lost against Alabama or the one that confidently took care of business against Utah State — may be a harbinger of how the remainder of the season plays out.
It will also be smack in the middle of a brutal start to the season for USC, which has a quick turnaround with a Friday night game the following week at Utah. From there, the schedule clears up, with four of the following five games held at the Coliseum. The only road game in that stretch is against Arizona, a beatable opponent. In fact, their next five opponents after Utah — Arizona State, Colorado, Arizona, Cal and Oregon — are all games USC should be favored in (For what it’s worth, ESPN projects that USC has a 60 percent chance or more of winning each of its next six games after Stanford). 
The “glass half full” view is that the Trojans win one out of two games against Stanford and Utah, live up to expectations for the next month, and head into a tilt against No. 8 Washington on the road on Nov. 12 with a 7-2 record. 
But that is looking too far ahead, especially for a team that has already taken fans on a roller coaster ride lasting two weeks. And in today’s world of overreactions to everything, a poor performance on Saturday will have people kicking and screaming that USC will never get back to its glory days.
So, with the direction of the season still undecided, we’ll wait and see if Helton can notch his first “signature win,” if Browne takes advantage of his second appearance in primetime and whether L.A.’s football team (sorry, Rams. I’ll consider recognizing your existence once you score a point) is on the path back to prominence or still getting run over by Christian McCaffrey.
About a year ago, an unranked team came into the Coliseum and shocked a conference opponent ranked in the top 10. That team was Stanford, and on Saturday, USC has a chance to return the favor and jump-start its season.

Two games into the season, the Trojans have been on both the giving and receiving end of a blowout, but that is likely to change this weekend as the team travels to face No. 7 Stanford in Palo Alto.
Despite the odds seemingly being stacked against the Trojans — not being ranked, off-the-field distractions, Stanford’s junior running back Christian McCaffrey — fans should expect a competitive and hard-fought game until the end.
Stanford has beat USC six of the last eight times the two teams have met, including two victories for the Cardinal last season.  The first meeting ended in a 41-31 loss in the Coliseum before the Pac-12 Championship game where Stanford erupted in the fourth quarter to win, 41-22.
USC, however, beat the Cardinal in their most recent game at Stanford Stadium, a 2014 matchup that ended in a 13-10 victory for the Men of Troy.
The focus of USC’s defense is on McCaffrey, a Heisman finalist last year. In 2015, he broke the NCAA single-season all-purpose yards record, finishing the year with 3,864 yards. McCaffrey was also the first non-Heisman winner to be awarded the AP Player of the Year in six years.
In two games against USC last year, McCaffrey totaled 710 all-purpose yards and in the Pac-12 Championship game he rushed, threw and received a touchdown. Sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith is a critical player if the Trojans hope to contain McCaffrey.
“We have got to tackle him,” Smith said. “He’s just a human. He’s a great ball player, but we have got to do our job. He’s very elusive.”
McCaffrey isn’t the only problem the Trojan defense will face and preparing for Stanford’s thinking man offense, where two plays are called in the huddle and the quarterback makes the final decision at the line, has kept defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast on his toes.
“They give you a lot of things,” Pendergast said. “They give you multiple personnel groupings, multiple formations. They force you to have to adjust and you’ve got to be on your Ps and Qs because of the different things they do and you have to be really good at playing situation football.”
The Cardinal are known for their power and strength in the trenches, and their offensive line has great experience as they start three juniors, one senior and one fifth-year senior. On the defensive side of things, the Cardinal start only three sophomores and not a single freshman, compared to the USC defense that lists six sophomores as starters.
In the last six regular season meetings between the two teams, the margin of victory has been 10 points or fewer. Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne, who is in his fourth season, has seen the close wins and loses and understands how important his role will be in determining Saturday’s outcome.
“I’ve been here long enough to know this game’s going to come down to a few points,” Browne said. “Very competitive team, very competitive rivalry — especially in recent memory. It’s going to come down to a few throws so just staying prepared and executing what we need to do.”
Browne threw his first touchdown pass last week against Utah State, as did backup quarterback redshirt freshman Sam Darnold. Both quarterbacks saw significant playing time, and being able to utilize the strengths of both players in certain situations is something head coach Clay Helton expects to do.
Despite the two touchdowns against the Aggies, Browne’s longest pass of the game was 27 yards, and the Trojans biggest momentum plays came defensively (an interception) and from the special teams unit (blocked punt and punt return touchdown).
“We missed a few last week,” Browne said. “It falls on my shoulders, so making sure those balls are accurate and giving our guys a chance. I feel like that’s one of my strengths -— just going out there and throwing the deep ball. It’s backyard ball, I’ve been doing that since the good old recess days. Going out there and executing those plays, those plays are big momentum plays, so that’ll be huge for us.”
Saturday’s game marks the first Pac-12 game of the season and is being broadcast on ABC. Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m.

My first few days at USC I was in awe, stepping foot on a campus that was so surreal and beautiful. But it wasn’t the architecture or the incredibly green landscape; I was joyfully perplexed by all the attractive students here. I felt as if Urban Outfitters’ model database exploded on campus but for security’s sake disguised in Lululemons, dad hats and Ralph Lauren Polo shirts. With the plethora of intelligent and charming students, could this campus be a dating heaven? This is a University full of people with different cultural backgrounds, interests and Instagram feed aesthetics — there’s got to be a multitude of people compatible for a single person. Which made me think: Dating is a lot like being at a Vegas buffet. 
Oh, man. Vegas buffets. Endless, gluttonous amounts of delicious noms including the weekly prime rib brunch and seafood buffets. From carving stations to the many featured cuisines, the cherry-on-top is the full dessert bar and an all-you-can-drink beer and wine bar. It’s kind of a hassle to drive off the strip for it, but it’s always worth the little extra effort for the extra nice. Also, averaging from $20-$30, it’s not too bad of a deal. Steep price for a college student meal, but I mean you’ve got to invest a little for a Vegas buffet.
Similarly so, dating begins with agreeing to invest yourself. Yes, we’re all social beings, but putting yourself out there for romantic interests can be incredibly different from creating platonic friendships. Choosing to be in the dating field, whether it be college parties, Tinder or “networking” (that’s for you, Marshall students), requires an investment of time and vulnerability. And why is it not like a HomeTown Buffet with the weekly coupons bargaining out to a total of $5, or maybe a step up at Souplantation? Because choosing to date and to allocate time toward others in romantic pursuits during college or even post-grad can be a steep investment considering the time spent that could be used toward career development or even focusing on the self. 
You’re invested — you’re in the buffet. Why are you really there? Whether to satisfy some sort of need, to taste an array of new foods or to go a second round to try out what you may have missed the first time, there’s always a motive. There’s endless cuisines to consume and experience. Some options seem really appealing — you try it, you love it. Maybe you don’t. On the opposite end, maybe you saw something that you weren’t attracted to at first, but once you give it a chance, you’re in love. Someone might even have introduced or suggested the course to you, and without this person you would have never encountered something so fulfilling. Are you catching my drift yet?
Going to buffets is also a mental game. Are you really going to be able to consume all that you really want to consume? Which dishes are you going to prioritize? Identify the things that aren’t good for you — the greasy-looking “Chinese” food or the sad salad bar; are those really worth your health and time? Should you invest the stomach space or time to go out of your way to re-experience something that you’ve had over and over again, especially if you know that it isn’t that great or might even give you stomach pains later. It’s like that ex that you’re keeping tabs on or the fickle cutie that inconsistently texts you — maybe that’s the entrée you shouldn’t return to. 
There are definite joys of being at the buffet. You get to know some new courses, you learn what doesn’t work with your palate, maybe you find your new favorite dish. But just remember to not run in and stack plates high with anything and everything — what’s healthy and worth it for you? And at the end of the day, maybe the Vegas buffet isn’t meant for you. We all have different tastes and mentalities when it comes to dating — just don’t let it consume you instead.

Spoken word poet and Thought Catalog staff writer Ari Eastman has made a career out of writing about her feelings. From Tumblr to Twitter to every social media outlet in between, Eastman has masterfully balanced the act of pouring out her heart in a serious and humorous way. In her third and newest poetry book, Bloodline, Eastman transports audiences to a new dimension of human emotion. The wordsmith recounts personal stories of her adolescence, including the grief of father’s death, her first heartbreak and experiences growing up in this resilient and touching work.
Two of her books, Green Eyes and I Promised You I Wouldn’t Write This, were mainly focused on her dating life, with an emphasis on self-love and a look into her battle with mental illness. While she continues to discuss relationships and mental health, Bloodline shows a new maturity and an even more sincere writing style.
The tone of the book starts joyfully with “the doctor says ‘it’s a girl’ and my relieved father celebrates.” She recalls how her father was afraid to raise a son and how she wishes she could go back and tell him how much she appreciated him.
 In the poem “Maybe the text wasn’t about you,” Eastman honestly describes her feelings about her father’s death. “I start sleeping in my mom’s bed, because mine is too cold, and I end up crying until I can’t see,” she writes. “She fluffs pillows and puts on episodes of Gilmore Girls. In her bed, I am not alone. In her bed, I have someone to remind me it won’t always be this cold.” Unafraid to hold back any emotion or detail, she pours out her soul, creating a beautiful and relatable result. The reader is able to visualize a young girl, empty and hurt, finding solace and warmth from her mother in a helpless situation. As a writer who is best known for chronicling her romantic life, it is refreshing to see Eastman write about a different, but equally important type of love.
Eastman continues to touch on mental health and her struggles with overcoming them since a young age. In “Anxiety,” she speaks about how normal social situations terrify her, like sleepovers at her friend’s house. “I don’t know why I can’t settle like the other girls. Or why I’m so convinced that tonight is the night the roof will cave in and everything I’ve ever known will cease to exist.” Those who have gone through similar feelings, especially adolescent girls, will find pieces of themselves in Ari’s words, feeling as though she expressed their exact sentiments.
 Her thoughts are paired with a consistent salmon, black and white color palette to visually illustrate her words. In her poem “Murmur,” the silhouette of a man (in salmon) and woman (black) are portrayed, almost touching, powerfully complementing her views on loss. Whether it’s breakups, infatuation or simply fighting to live, Ari Eastman manages to make all her pain magical. Her character has grown immensely, and it shows  in her writing. While she has changed, the best thing is that her core has stayed the same — a flawed human being who unabashedly shares her feelings and always strives to see beauty in pain. Bloodline comes out on Sept. 30.

The US-China Institute hosted a talk by author Duncan Clark about his new book Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built at the Annenberg Auditorium on Thursday afternoon.
The book covers the rise of e-commerce website Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, from Ma’s humble origins as an English teacher to the website’s meteoric rise into an e-commerce behemoth that boasted of largest IPO in 2014 at $25 billion. 
Clark, who met Ma in 1999, provides an insider’s perspective into the last decade and a half of Alibaba. He pulls from personal experience as an advisor at Alibaba as well as his insider access to Ma for a number of exclusive interviews to discuss the impact of Alibaba and the rise of the internet in China over the last two decades.
During the talk, Clark explored the history of the company and how it rose from humble beginnings in a small apartment in the Wenzhou province to one of the world’s most powerful businesses. 
At a young age, Ma ran a business showing tourists around his home province for free in return for lessons in English. Soon enough, Ma began building a following of similarly minded entrepreneurs, in part due to the fact that Wenzhou Province was one of the leading areas for entrepreneurs in the early 1990s. The group eventually co-founded Alibaba with Ma.
“I think he’s the team. It’s not just Jack,” Clark said.  “It’s always been about the people around him as well.”
Clark shared anecdotes about Ma’s personality and personal ambition, but emphasized his humble outlook on life and self-deprecating humor as important qualities of the man who built the empire of e-commerce in China. It’s estimated that Alibaba controls about 80 percent of China’s e-commerce through apps including popular payment method Alipay and website and app TaoBao.
Natalie Zhao, a freshman studying business administration, explained the popularity and appeal of popular Alibaba platform TaoBao. 
“Apps like TaoBao are so commonly used by people around the world, and especially in China — all my relatives have bought things on there. The delivery and quality of the products are what make Alibaba very convenient and efficient for the users,” Zhao said.
Clark attributed the success of Alibaba in reaching the notoriously fickle Chinese markets — in which many e-commerce companies such as Ebay and Chinese-native 848 had previously failed — to its ability to reach customers and create a sense of trust with them. For the first time ever, he explained, an e-commerce business combined with a financial and logistics business to provide a one-stop shop for consumers.
Furthermore, Alibaba built in measures that gave customers what they wanted, such as seven-day free returns and the ability to rate merchants directly on the platform, according to Clark. The biggest feature to inspire trust in the Chinese market, however, was the innovation of keeping payments in escrow until the product was actually received by the customer, easing the most pressing fear of the Chinese market and opening it up to e-commerce.
Clark also talked about Alibaba’s expansion beyond China and its strategy in the coming years. Despite already being a powerful e-commerce force in rapidly expanding economies such as Russia and Brazil, Alibaba hasn’t quite resonated with the middle class of Western Europe and the United States, where it faces big competition from old stalwarts like Amazon and Ebay, as well as PayPal in the financial sector. 
Alibaba’s focus right now, however, isn’t necessarily on expanding to the United States and Europe, but rather on bringing high-quality and brand products from the United States and Europe to Chinese customers who can now afford them after China’s economic boom, due in part to Alibaba itself.
“It is interesting that Jack has become a transcendent figure in these places,” Clark said of Alibaba’s now-worldwide business. “He is effectively the American Dream set in China.”

Countless sexual assault cases have been in the news recently, especially those which lead to university investigations and Title IX violations. The problems that have been high-profile in the campus sexual assault arena are not only issues that exist within higher education, but are  also prevalent within our general society.
Little has been done to combat it. The failure of primary and secondary schools to address sexual harassment and assault in grades K-12 mirrors the failure to address it in society as a whole. However, California’s new sexual health education law, designed for grades 7-12, requires schools to address troubling attitudes about gender and power, which experts say contribute to sexual harassment and even assaults on college campuses. Moreover, this important law will provide schools with the opportunity for students to have an open and meaningful conversation about healthy relationships and body image, and fosters a curriculum that positively affirms gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students.
This new law has the power to confront previously unaddressed sexual harassment and assault incidents in K-12 schools, which are the training grounds for college sexual assaults. While some people may think that harassment does not begin until students reach late teens or adulthood, in a 2011 national study conducted by the American Association of University Women, 48 percent of 2,000 seventh to twelfth graders surveyed experienced some form of harassment based on their gender during the school year. Examples of the harassment experienced included unwelcome sexual comments and gestures, being touched in an unwelcome way and being forced to do something sexual. Students who engage in such behavior are likely to have issues with gender and power, which may include a personal or cultural belief that men should hold a dominant position over women in society, or a conviction that gender roles must be strictly defined. Those beliefs, according to researcher Dorothy Espelage from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, are “associated with higher rates of sexual harassment.”
Ideas about power and gender come to the forefront in middle school when students take note of their relative status as social and sexual beings. According to the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, Espelage surveyed 1,000 fifth, sixth, and seventh grade students, and found that the combination of high bullying rates and high rates of homophobic name-calling was a predictive indicator of which middle school boys were more likely to sexually harass other students. These findings may not imply that bullying directly leads to rape, but certainly suggest the need for schools to explicitly address and forbid sexual and gender-based harassment.
Sexual harassment and assault is against the law in federally funded schools under Title IX, yet most people associate this piece of legislation with sports, and do not know that it also applies to sexual assault and harassment. As noted by Brett Sokolow, executive director of the Association of Title IX Administrators, enforcement of Title IX in K-12 schools is poor. Sokolow estimates that about 85 percent of school district nationwide are out of compliance with the law. Yet, schools are obligated to act if they are aware of an act of sexual violence, and must take immediate action to address the harassment or assault, prevent its recurrence and acknowledge its effects. Currently, about 90 Title IX sexual violence investigations are underway nationwide in elementary and secondary school districts, including seven in California. Examples of these Title IX complaints filed between 2012 and 2015 at various California schools include a high school girl describing a male putting his hand down the front of her shirt, a middle school parent’s statement that when her daughter alerted the principal to unwanted sexual touching, the principal asked her what she was wearing, and perhaps most shockingly, the account of a fifth grade boy following two female students around the playground while shouting comments about their bodies and what sexual acts he would perform on them.
This new California sexual health education law would allow schools to be a place where teachers, administrators, and staff could discuss with students in age-appropriate ways about gender equality, sexual harassment and how to give consent. This new piece of legislation, in conjunction with another new law requiring curriculum affirmative consent to be taught to high school students as part of a health class for a graduation requirement, addresses the growing need for conversations about gender and power in K-12 classrooms. These pertinent discussions are key ways to confront troubling attitudes about gender inequality and sexual harassment and assault that are part of the underlying causes of sexual violence in K-12 schools and college campuses.

Last week, Brown University announced that since October 2015, their Department of Public Safety has excluded race and ethnicity from crime reports, following the footsteps of other colleges such as University of Maryland and University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 
According to Brown DPS Chief of Police Mark Porter and Deputy Chief of Police Paul Shanley, the department includes race-based classifications only when it “adds value as part of a complete and thorough description.” Otherwise, the mention of race in reports may lead to enforcement decisions based on stereotypes and confusion.
The measure adopted by Brown and other institutions moves toward greater campus inclusion and recognition that even college campuses are not devoid of brutality and racial profiling. In light of the current social climate, USC’s DPS should eliminate descriptions of race from crime reports, using universities which have embraced this concept as templates.
A quick glance at the catalogue of USC crime alerts reveals just how many suspect descriptions rest upon racial background. Nearly all reported offenses include the race of the suspect, among other characteristics reported by the victim, including suspect height, weight, build, gender, etc. The mention of race in USC reports, however, can be troubling, since it has conjured prejudicial actions in the past at other universities. 
Time and time again, incidents on college campuses across the United States have proven the disturbing repercussions of including race in crime reports. In January 2015 at Yale, Tahj Blow, a student at the university, was forced to the ground at gunpoint because he fit the description of “tall, African-American, college-aged student wearing a black jacket and a red and white hat.” At the University of Minnesota, in 2013, campus police released the portrait of an armed suspect. Later, police said the man was not involved.
The difference, however, is that the University of Minnesota acted. Black students shared that people often looked at them suspiciously when a descriptor such as “black male suspect” was released, even though the criminal more often than not turned out to be someone unaffiliated with the university. Citing “the reinforcement of racist stereotypes of black men, and other people of color” and the creation of “a climate of suspicion and hostility,” the university administration eliminated suspect race in crime reports.
However, Brown DPS does make note of the suspect’s race internally, leading critics to question the effectiveness of the change, since it is police profiling that results in more deadly consequences. Nevertheless, the absence of race in crime reports does combat unreliable eyewitness accounts.
This development backs countless studies conducted on suspect reporting. Under intense stress, victims tend to misidentify the race of the criminal, a phenomenon otherwise known as the same race effect. Research also shows that memory can be wary after a crime, as the heightened fear interferes with assessment ability. DPS officers rely on students as their eyes and ears, but these eyewitness accounts are often unreliable. Thus, USC DPS must reevaluate the content of their crime report criterion. 
Ultimately, racial bias is not unique to our campus or campuses throughout the nation. But we have to start somewhere to correct false assumptions that too often lead to unjust, sometimes violent endings. That onus is on our DPS to respect USC’s diversity.

Osa Masina, the suspended sophomore USC linebacker involved in multiple sexual assault investigations, has been charged with one count of first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree forcible sodomy, according to a police spokesman with the Cottonwood Heights Police Department in Utah.
According to Masina’s attorney, Greg Skordas, Masina will surrender to police at the Salt Lake Metro County Jail on Thursday. Skordas told ESPN that bail has been set at $250,000.
The charges came following a month-long investigation of an incident that allegedly took place on July 25th in Cottonwood Heights. Masina — along with redshirt sophomore defensive end Don Hill — is also involved in another investigation concerning an alleged incident in Los Angeles that occurred on July 14th, when Masina and Hill allegedly sexually assaulted the same woman in Hill’s off-campus apartment. TMZ, which obtained a search warrant, reported that Masina allegedly sent videos of the incident via Snapchat to the woman’s ex-boyfriend.
Charges have yet to be filed in the Los Angeles incident.
Masina was placed under “interim suspension” on Tuesday and was also banned from campus earlier this week. Masina and Hill, who has also been suspended, had been allowed to practice and attend team meetings leading up to the first two games of the season, though neither has played in a game.
All of the charges are first-degree felonies, which could bring about a sentence of five years to life in prison, according to Skordas.
Masina, 19, is a native of Salt Lake City and was a five-star recruit out of Brighton High School.
