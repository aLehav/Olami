USC’s Thornton School of Music is set to introduce the first-ever venue designed to cater to the needs of songwriters.
The new Songwriter’s Theater is a face-lift of a small 50-seat site built by the School of Cinematic Arts as a sound mixing stage in the early 1980s, according to USC News.
This venue comes in light of the rapid growth of the popular music program over the past few years, from a small elective taken by 13 students to a nationally known program.
The new 981-square-foot space will house state-of-the-art acoustics and lighting, as well as intricate curtains and lights to give it a retro feel.
The theater will also include musical instruments such as a grand piano, a drum set and guitars donated by Taylor Guitars.
Vice Dean of the Division of Contemporary Music and founder of the Popular Music Program Chris Sampson said the new venue was needed because of the importance that songwriting has in the study of music at Thornton.
“For me, this room symbolizes the way that songwriting has become accepted within an educational environment,” Sampson told USC News. “We value the importance of the song as the place where it all starts. Without a great song, there’s nothing to record. There’s nothing to share with an audience.”
Sampson is hoping that the theater will solidify the idea that all elements of the modern-day music industry begin with writing a song, and students’ time in the theater will further their passion for songwriting.
The Songwriter’s Theater will open its doors to USC students and alumni from the popular music program, such as singer-songwriter Rozzi Crane, for its inauguration at 6 p.m. on March 24.

After finishing third overall at the Pac-12 Championships at the beginning of the month in Federal Way, Wash., the
No. 13 men’s swimming and diving team now preps for the NCAA Championships, which begin on Wednesday in Indianapolis.
 USC enjoyed a strong showing at the conference championships, highlighted by senior Steven Stumph, who became the first-ever Trojan to win three consecutive 200y breaststroke titles. Sophomore Carsten Vissering also posted a school-record time of 51.45 seconds en route to earning the first 100y breaststroke championship of his career, and junior diver Dashiell Enos rounded out the Trojans’ Pac-12 champions, successfully defending his 3-meter springboard title.
Beyond the title winners, Stumph and redshirt junior Dylan Carter were three-time finalists for the first time in their careers during USC’s trip to Federal Way, and Carter set a new school record in the 200y freestyle with a time of 1:31.98. Redshirt junior Santo Condorelli also made three finals — the second time he has done so as a Trojan.
Riding this momentum, USC now sets its sights on the national stage, as the NCAA Championships run from Wednesday through Saturday of this week at the Indiana University Natatorium. Though the Trojans do not have any national champions on their roster, they have won at least one NCAA title in nine of the last 16 seasons, and as a whole, USC owns nine NCAA team titles — good for fourth all-time. Its 120 combined event titles (98 individual, 22 relay) is also good for fourth-most nationally.
The Trojans’ last team championship may have come in 1977, but they have been knocking on the door in recent years, finishing fourth in 2013 and 2015. USC will also enjoy the return of two Olympians this season, as Carter and Condorelli sat out the previous campaign to train for the Rio Games with Trinidad and Tobago and Canada, respectively. The Trojans boast four top-10 seeds in the field, including Carter, who is seeded fourth in the 200y freestyle. Stumph is seeded sixth in the 200y breaststroke, and Vissering is the fourth seed in the 100y breast. Sophomore Patrick Mulcare is the Trojans’ highest seed overall as the third seed in the 200y backstroke. All five of USC’s relay teams are also seeded either ninth or 10th.
The 800y freestyle relay kicks off proceedings at 3 p.m. on Wednesday. After that, from Thursday through Saturday, prelims start at 7 a.m. before finals at 3 p.m. Thursday will feature the 200y freestyle relay, 500y freestyle, 200y IM, 50y freestyle, 400y medley relay and 1-meter diving, and the events scheduled for Friday are the 400y IM, 100y butterfly, 200y freestyle, 100y breaststroke, 100y backstroke, 200y medley relay and 3-meter diving. The championships will wrap up on Saturday with the 1650y freestyle, 200y backstroke, 100y freestyle, 200y breaststroke, 200y butterfly, 400y freestyle relay and platform diving.

When the Trojans’ run in the NCAA tourney ended on Sunday, I wasn’t surprised. But I was disappointed — not in the team, but in its seeding.
The majority of NCAA seeding is a complete mystery. It’s fairly obvious that the top four teams should take the No. 1 seeds and the rest should work its way down from there. But how did three Pac-12 teams finish in the top 10 of the postseason AP poll only to end up with No. 2 and No. 3 seeds? How did an SMU team ranked at No. 11 somehow fall nine slots for tournament seedings?
And, most importantly, how did USC end up scrabbling for a spot in a First Four game despite notching a school-best 26 wins in a conference as competitive as the Pac-12? Clear answers are few and far between, but one thing is obvious: The Trojans’ seeding directly affected their ability to perform in the postseason.
I’ll be the first to admit that I wasn’t the most optimistic fan when it came to USC’s postseason prospects. I grew up on Kansas basketball, so I’ve grown accustomed to a high caliber of expectations for how my team will progress in the Big Dance. But as the tourney neared, I was baffled by the nationwide scrutiny of the Trojans’ ability to even make the bracket.
The Pac-12 might not be the toughest conference in the NCAA, but it’s not a walk in the park, either. Getting banged up by teams like Arizona is nothing to be ashamed of, and the fact that USC hung with Oregon and took down UCLA speaks to the talent that the young squad has to offer. Yet somehow, a few road beatings and a couple of unfortunate losses to lesser teams like Arizona State left the Trojans on the edge of that precarious bubble.
The national view of the
Pac-12 is a different tangent that can be argued at length another day. But the way that USC was treated in particular in the postseason is impossible to understand. 
When the final bracket is decided, the First Four games are selected. These four games are played between the final eight teams to make the Big Dance, with the winners continuing onto the Round of 64. In theory, this part of the play-in system makes sense — it allows the bottom tier of talent to duke it out on an even playing field, giving lower-ranked teams the opportunity to fight for their spot in the tournament.
That would seem completely equitable if these First Four games were fighting for 16-seeds, therefore establishing the bottom of the bracket. But in 2016, the NCAA split the First Four so that two teams fight for a
16-seed, while the other two fight for an 11-seed.
Why? Yeah, I don’t have an answer to that one. But the result is that two mid-ranked teams won’t even make it into the round of 64, while two lesser teams’ tickets are automatically punched. It’s not fair, and it quite simply doesn’t make sense.
The matchup between Providence and USC illustrated exactly why this new system is ridiculous. In the NCAA rankings provided alongside the seedings, USC was ranked No. 45 while Providence was ranked
No. 42. If the bracket followed a simple top-down ranking system, that would’ve placed both teams in 11-seed or 12-seed positions, right in the middle of the first-round action.
Instead, the teams were forced to play-in for their spot in the first round. Both teams suffered as a result — Providence, due to its loss, was robbed of making back-to-back appearances in the Round of 64, while USC was forced to play three games in the span of five days.
In those five days, the Trojans proved their grit, overcoming a 17-point deficit to roar back against Providence before toppling SMU to advance to the second round of the tourney. The starting five and the bench stepped up to play some of the Trojans’ best basketball, with every player from freshman Nick Rakocevic to junior veteran Jordan McLaughlin carving an impactful performance into their postseason play.
But by the time the Trojans reached Baylor on their fifth day of dancing, it was clear that there was only so much fight left in them. They were, quite simply, exhausted. And although they went down swinging, the team had run out of gas by the end of their close matchup against the No. 3 seed.
The game was only decided by 4 points — an impressive feat for a team that remained unranked for the majority of the season facing off against a former AP No. 1 squad. Some loyal fans might even argue that a few different calls by the referees could have given the Trojans the win.
The bottom line, however, is that USC simply didn’t have the energy to push itself through the final minutes of Sunday’s game. But if it had, Trojan fans may have seen a conceivable path to the Final Four, with four of the East bracket’s top-five seeds eliminated (including Baylor).
A spot in the First Four is not necessarily a death sentence for teams. At least one First Four team has made it to the Round of 32 since it was first introduced in 2011, including the Virginia Commonwealth squad that scrapped its way to the Final Four that year. Being the underdog certainly has its perks, and that was clear even for USC in the team’s first two games of the tourney.
But the toil of playing three games in that short period of time clearly takes its toll on the First Four teams. None of those teams remains in the tournament, despite impressive showings from Rhode Island and USC. And although the 16-seeds were clearly overmatched — UC Davis, for instance, took a 100-62 beating in the first round from Kansas — the 11-seeds that played in put up fights that showed flashes of postseason brilliance that weren’t given a proper chance to flourish.
The play-in round makes sense when based on ranking. But the NCAA’s decision to split the seeding this way is only hurting teams that have already earned their place in the tourney.
It’s hard to predict how any team will fare in the postseason (just ask Villanova). But if it weren’t for this year’s seeding in the First Four, our Trojans might still be dancing.

Interesting perspective Julia.  Agree with your views on the NCAA seeding logic.  Never made any sense at all.  Play in teams should all be fighting for the 16th slot.  My opinion.  But getting to the Baylor game.  I did not see fatigue as a big issue.  Of course it was harder on SC to recover vs. Baylor given the span of games and time they each experienced a different hand dealt.  But watching the game the Trojans did not appear to be tired at all.  They lived and died by 3’s and in the end the 3’s were rushed and perhaps not even needed with 2 mins to go and the game still very close and competitive.  SC never quit and for that Im very impressed with Enfield and staff as they were ready.  With a strong recruiting class and a little luck and thus loyalty from our NBA candidates we may be very strong next year.  Fight On!

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanTaking strides · Junior running back Ronald Jones II looks to improve even further under new running backs coach Deland McCullough.
After a week of spring break, the Trojans resumed football in the rain on Tuesday. The story of the day was USC’s defense, which forced a number of turnovers in 11-on-11 and 7-on-7 drills. 
McCullough’s First Few Weeks 
After the departure of former running backs coach Tommie Robinson to LSU, the Trojans tapped Indiana’s Deland McCullough to be his replacement.
“We brought him in for an interview, and he just blew us away,” head coach Clay Helton said.
During his time at Indiana, McCullough played a role in the development of future NFL players Tevin Coleman and Jordan Howard. When looking to replace Robinson, McCullough’s track record of success jumped off of the page. Offensive coordinator Tee Martin said McCullough “won us over in half a day.”
“One thing I was looking for in the interview process was running backs coaches that had a great history of taking care of the football,” Martin said. “That’s the thing that he’s bringing to the table, and you can already see it in our guys.”
McCullough inherits a talented backfield, with junior running back Ronald Jones II leading the group.
“[McCullough] is giving us tools and ideas that I’ve never even thought about,” Jones said.
Helton echoed the others’ praise of McCullough.
“He never takes a play off,” he said. “I like his diligence. I like his attention to detail, and I can see the guys already progressing from it. Especially Ronald Jones — right off the bat he’s doing things that weren’t showing up last year.”
USC’s offense would certainly welcome even further improvement from Jones, who averaged 6.1 yards per rush in 2016 and finished the season with 12 touchdowns.
Switching sides
Helton has used spring football to try out different guys at new positions. One of the players in the shuffle is sophomore Keyshawn “Pie” Young, who spent last season at cornerback but had his first day on offense on Tuesday.
“[After] losing four wide receivers, we really wanted to be able take a look at him on the offensive side,” Helton said. “What’s shown up just in this initial practice is really natural route running, really natural ball skills. He can do things after the catch, and we’re excited about him.”
USC will continue experimenting throughout the spring. Sophomore cornerback Jack Jones is also set to get time on offense, though he impressed defensively on Tuesday, picking off redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold.
Tempers Flare 
Frustration prevailed as the Trojans practiced through the drizzle, with a scuffle breaking out between redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins, junior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga and others. Helton was unimpressed by the extracurricular activities and made his players do up-downs.
“We got a little extra competitive,” Helton said. “I just reminded them that we are a team of brothers. If we get too much extra pushing and shoving and make a poor decision, that could cost a penalty in a game.”
The head coach is stressing discipline this spring, especially after some key personal fouls hurt the Trojans in 2016.
“We have to make great decisions and when those decisions aren’t made, you’d better handle it immediately,” Helton said. “They got the point.” 
Well who made some of the key plays on defense besides Jack Jones intercept? The story of the day was defense with no
individual  players signaled out in your column. Who forced the turnovers? No need to know that a player is a redshirt senior
with this his last  year regardless.

After a successful spring break trip to Hawaii that saw the
No. 1 beach volleyball team capture the Outrigger Hawaii Invitational Crown, the undefeated Trojans (11-0) will now gear up for their first home match of 2017, as they host Loyola Marymount in a dual on Wednesday at noon at Merle Norman Stadium. Immediately following the dual will be a pairs tournament between the Trojans and the Lions starting at approximately 2 p.m.
Over the weekend, USC rattled off seven straight victories at the Outrigger Hawaii Invitational in Honolulu against a stacked field that featured three of the nation’s top seven teams, including No. 4 Florida State, tournament host No. 5 Hawaii and
No. 7 Arizona. The Trojans defeated the East Coast rival Seminoles twice in just three days, in addition to posting a pair of 5-0 sweeps over Nebraska and 4-1 wins over Utah, Arizona and Hawaii.
Head coach Anna Collier’s upperclassmen had dominant showings in the tournament, led by seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler, who provided 4 dual-clinching points from the second court and went 6-1 on the weekend. Juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer were also solid at the five spot, dropping just one set in their seven matches and going a perfect 7-0. The newly formed pair is now 9-1 on the season overall.
In addition, senior All-Americans Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes pushed their own winning streak to 84 consecutive wins at the top court after going undefeated on the islands. Hughes was named the tournament’s most outstanding player as she and Claes helped USC improve its school-record winning streak to 41 matches in a row.
Claes attributes the team’s early success to the high level of competition exhibited every day in practice.
“There’s always a really high level of aggressiveness out there because we want to make each other better,” Claes said. “Everyone pushes each other, and Anna kicks it up a little more just to make sure that everybody is playing at a high level and always giving an all-out effort. All of that really helps prepare us when we get to play other teams.”
The next opponent on the schedule for USC is Loyola Marymount, a team that the Trojans swept 5-0 in their last meeting back in 2016. The Lions received votes in this week’s AVCA National Poll (though they remain unranked) and are led by their top pair of Sarah Sponcil and Savannah Slattery.
While USC has never lost to Loyola Marymount and is 15-0 in the series all-time, Sponcil was part of the last pair to defeat Claes and Hughes in NCAA competition. In April 2015, Sponcil and then-partner Betsi Metter pulled out a thrilling
15-13 third-set victory over Claes and Hughes in a dual at Merle Norman Stadium, but since then, the Trojan seniors haven’t lost a match, dropping just two sets total in that nearly two-year span.
Hughes knows that teams like LMU and pairs like Sponcil and Slattery are always looking to pull the upset over USC, but as long as the Trojans can take care of their own side of the net, Hughes believes they will be in good shape.
“We all know that we have a huge target on our back this season and that every team will be playing their absolute best against us every single match,” Hughes said. “But for us, if we just worry about how we play and take care of what we can control, then we’ll be fine.”
Forecasts predict showers on Wednesday morning, but, rain or shine, competition at Merle Norman Stadium will begin at
noon with the dual match against LMU, followed immediately thereafter by the pairs tournament at
2 p.m.

On Friday, the film Life will be released in theaters. Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Life is a science-fiction horror film that stars
Jake Gyllenhaal as David Jordan and Rebecca Ferguson as Miranda North. 
Gyllenhaal was the last actor to be on board with the film. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Gyllenhaal said it was the plot and many other elements such as the director Espinosa that
attracted him to the enthralling and terrifying script. 
The film follows a crew aboard the International Space Station struggling to study, understand and survive on Mars against extraterrestrial life. While many other science -fiction films have been released before, Gyllenhaal emphasizes why Life is different than films from the same genre such as Interstellar and The Martian. 
Gyllenhaal discussed why Life’s science fiction is unique among all the other films .
“Obviously [Life] is in a similar genre but ultimately, this one is specifically individualistic because it is all in zero gravity and leans more toward horror,” Gyllenhaal said.
Life is the first science-fiction film to be completely shot with the actors on wires, in order to depict the zero gravity of space. In the film, the astronauts aboard the space station come to realize the alien life they’ve encountered is dangerous and struggle to fight it. The movie follows the theme of the survival of mankind, not just for the astronauts but also for the humans close by on Earth, and is more terrifying than the classical movie sense, according to Gyllenhaal. 
Gyllenhaal said he had one of the best times on set ever while shooting a movie. Working alongside actors such as Ryan Reynolds only enhanced the shooting process and the two became very close while working alongside each other on set.
“Honestly whenever you have a movie with Ryan Reynolds in it — it’s going to be fun,” he said. “He is inevitably an extraordinarily funny comedian.”
The majority of the film depicts the astronauts in zero gravity, and Gyllenhaal discusses the difficulties with portraying the acrobatic movements. 
“It takes a little bit of time to get your bearings in an environment like that,” Gyllenhaal said.
“You’re hanging upside down or in the scene you’re literally spinning around when you’re trying to have a serious conversation with somebody … Sometimes it’s funny, sometimes it’s abnormal.” 
Many of Gyllenhaal’s dramatic scenes entailed him floating around on wires that caused him to find and constantly recenter his balance. He also added that coaches were always present on set to help the actors. The scenes where the space vessel collides into other objects was especially difficult to film because the actors had to take serious, physical pains to make the zero gravity motions look genuine, according to Gyllenhaal. 
“But the normal state — there is no normal state,” Gyllenhaal said.  “There is no up or down, there is no right or left in the International Space Station. As a result, the movie has that feeling too. I don’t think the audience will ever know which way is up or down, or right or left.”
Gyllenhaal is fascinated by movement; he believes that it’s half of acting. He said the actions in Life took the most time to master. As chaos continued, Gyllenhaal emphasized that the way each actor moved was specific to his or her character.
“The hardest part was shooting zero gravity,” Gyllenhaal said. “It was always a challenge, but I don’t like to do anything that’s not.”

Many think of a vegan diet as rabbit food. However, Sage Bistro proves that vegan food can be full of flavor. The restaurant’s menu entirely consists of plant-based ingredients purchased from local farmers. Through weekly communication with farmers, Sage works to ensure that diners receive the best tasting food.
 Sage Bistro has three Los Angeles locations in Culver City, Echo Park and Pasadena. Before entering the Culver City location, diners must make their way through a maze of potted plants that decorate the entrance to the restaurant. The interior style of the restaurant resembles a rustic farmhouse, which creates both a trendy atmosphere for young couples and a comfortable environment for families.
 Despite naming items that are composed entirely of plants, the menu at Sage is extensive and includes brunch, lunch, dinner and dessert. The prices of small plates and sides range from $7 to $14, and most of their entrees average $15 each.
For small plates, Sage’s waiters recommend the cauliflower wings, the fried brussel sprouts and the single pretzel. 
The tender cauliflower is coated with the diner’s choice of sweet and sour or buffalo sauce. For those hesitating to order the spicy buffalo sauce, have no fear — the creamy dipping sauce served with the cauliflower helps to tame the flame. The brussel sprouts are sauteed to perfection and paired with a habanero cream cheese sauce, and the warm, soft dough of the pretzel melts in the mouth.
With entrees, Sage Bistro’s most noteworthy options include the butternut squash ravioli, the eggplant arrabiata, the falafel bowl and the Brazilian bowl. 
The butternut squash involves four large raviolis served on a bed of kale. Inside each ravioli, the sweet squash filling is offset by a zesty pesto sauce. The soft linguini noodles of the next stand out pasta were served with tender eggplant slices, cashew “cheese” and vegetable and brown rice meatballs.
The falafel bowl mixes leafy greens, basmati rice, quinoa and falafel with cucumber, onions, roma tomato, avocado, orange slices and fresh cilantro. Although the falafels were hard and dry, the sweet tzatziki, mango aioli sauces and hummus were delicious enough to compensate. 
Overall, the entrees were as appetizing for the stomach as they were for the eyes since they mingled the colors and flavors of numerous plants and spices.
Diners can finish off their meal with a homemade good — Sage’s famous ice kreme or a shake for dessert. The dessert flavors change depending on the day and season, but no matter the time of year, the ice kreme is a must-try. Despite being made from a coconut base, the ice kreme tastes like normal ice cream — maybe even creamier.
Reservations are recommended, since Sage becomes crowded during popular dining hours. The staff and service were friendly, but inconsistent. Once seated, the appetizers and entrees came out quickly — almost too quickly. The waiter brought the entrees only minutes after the appetizers. As the restaurant grew busier later in the evening, the service became very lax. Though the service did not match the restaurant’s offerings, the delicious food more than made up for it. As a restaurant that offers guests both a new perspective on the vegan diet and a delicious meal, Sage Bistro is a treat for vegans and meat eaters alike.

After making a complete change from her college major in finance and interest in sculpture, director Niki Caro found herself pursuing a new career in directing. She was drawn to the art of telling stories, and she realized that sculpture — no matter how interesting the subject — can never communicate a story as distinctly as film can. 
Caro explained her artistic transition. 
“I did a sort of 180-degree move and began to try to create stories from films, as a means of connecting with an audience and telling stories in, I believe, the most visceral, emotional, moving and entertaining way,” she said. 
The desire to tell stories eventually brought Caro to directing — not only fictional stories, but also stories rooted in truth, including those based on past historical truths.
Caro’s most recent film, The Zookeeper’s Wife, originally a nonfiction book by Diane Ackerman, follows the true story of Antonina (Jessica Chastain) and Jan Zabinski (Johann Heldenbergh), a non-Jewish couple in Warsaw, Poland who sheltered hundreds of Holocaust survivors in their zoo. 
The film focuses around Antonina, a headstrong female protagonist whose strength is found in her softness. Antonina is compassionate and kind; she is courageous and strong, putting her and her husband’s lives at risk every day to care for hundreds. 
The history within The Zookeeper’s Wife was not the only thing that drew Caro to tell this story. 
“I was very compelled by the idea that this was a different kind of Holocaust movie — very exotic, very domestic and very, very female in its focus,” Caro said. 
While many Holocaust films focus on the horror and tragedy of the events, The Zookeeper’s Wife explores the survival and humility of humanity. Antonina, who is very shy and ill at ease with other people, finds a way to not only provide refuge, but to also build a home for 300 Polish Jews. 
“I was inspired by Antonina’s courage and her care and her compassion because she sheltered Jews at a great risk for her and her family for no other reason than it was the right thing to do,” Caro said.
The innate need to tell the story authentically falls at the center of Caro’s filmmaking values. From the scripting to casting to directing, Caro plays a role in ensuring every aspect is as detailed and accurate as possible. 
Caro worked closely with screenwriter Angela Workman to further represent the written script in the story she was creating. The script continued to change throughout the casting process. Caro and Workman added the character of Urszula (Shira Haas), a young, traumatized child that Antonina connected with and cared for as if she were an animal. 
The messages of hope in a time of trauma were the most important aspects of the film for Caro. She wanted to capture the essence of the tale and create a poignant film — not only because the story deserved to be told, but also because its messages are strong and pertinent today. The themes — feminine strength, helpfulness, personal sacrifice for others and oppression — resonate throughout the movie. 
The Zookeeper’s Wife is not merely a movie about World War II. It is a movie about the present day. 
“Young people need not look very much further than their daily newspaper to connect to the story at the moment,” Caro said.
The Zookeeper’s Wife hits theaters March 31.

It was more than just the fangirl in me that was shocked when I heard news that there would, indeed, be no songs in the upcoming live-action remake of Disney’s Mulan. After reading the director’s statement of the vision for the film as “a big, girly martial arts epic,” I couldn’t help it. The first thought I had was: Even Disney’s live-action The Jungle Book was a musical! Is it really harder to imagine Chinese people bursting into song than CGI bears?
Perhaps there is a part of me that is being petty, but consider also the great and ridiculous strides the public conscience had to take to get to this point in the first place.  Remember that collective breath we were all holding when we worried that the Mulan remake — like so many movies set in and starring “Asian” characters before it — would descend into the shameful and tiresome territory of whitewashing? A white Mulan? Sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? But hold on, those fears were not unfounded. Let’s not forget the bald-headed Tilda Swinton in Doctor Strange, or the raven-haired wig-donning Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell.
I am tired of patting movies on the back for casting Asian characters to play Asian roles. And I am tired of feeling relieved that they choose to acknowledge, in these movies that are so very few and far between, the very existence of Asian people with the media’s unlimited span of imagination. I am startlingly happy that my favorite childhood film — the movie that taught me, a young Asian American girl, to love and find bravery within myself — will now be reimagined in a hopefully bigger and brighter format.
But this happiness is not blind. And if I am to believe Disney’s vision, this superficial hallmark is where the remake’s originality ends. According to the director herself, it’s just another martial arts movie. And how many of those have we seen already?
It’s not just that I loved the music in Mulan. For me, that music demonstrated something much more rare: A second layer inside a movie about Asian characters, a relatable and fun and empathetic strand that ran through this story repeating, with each rhythm, its heartfelt message. That Asian characters can overcome caricatures. That they can laugh and they can sing and dance. That they are not just dragon ladies and wise men swinging swords and leaping into the air.
If we can’t even rise above stereotypes in this supposed triumph for Asian Americans in cinema, how, then, are we to put our visions and goals on bigger feats: God forbid, a fleshed-out, well-developed, original Asian or Asian American character?
Mulan was never strictly about martial arts and stunts and action (except, perhaps, that really cool sequence when the army is training during “We Are Men”). And trust me, Asian Americans everywhere can tell you how we’ve had enough of that: characters boiled down to the bone, defined only by the extreme physical stunts they can pull off with karate. No, the animated Mulan was something else: It was about the fight you have inside you — not the fights that demand physical strength. Mulan was the only movie I had growing up that presented a deep, flawed and yet entirely human presentation of an Asian woman. Mulan is strong, but stronger still in the fact that she had absolutely zero care for what society demanded of her.
I would wager as well that the movie Disney is so intent on producing — one about grit and martial arts — takes just as much choreography and training as if they had thought about making it a musical. And so what I am deriving from Disney’s decision to forge their own path with the Mulan remake is that it was a conscious and deliberate choice to drive the film back into the realm of Asian exoticism and mysticism that Hollywood just cannot seem to shake off. A Mulan without music shaves off an entire section of potential movie-goers (kids and families), but most importantly, presents a tiresome and redundant portrait of Asians that defeats the acclaimed subversiveness of the original film.

For decades, the LSAT has served almost universally as the great equalizer in law school admissions. Although individual schools have various ways of assigning GPA points on a transcript and follow different grade curves, the LSAT was the one indicator that all prospective law students needed in order to get into the very best law schools. It served as a good predictor of success in law school, and has been hailed as an exceptionally useful tool in determining which students are most fit for legal education.
That is, until now. Harvard Law School has announced that it will accept GRE scores from applicants moving forward, opening up a new can of worms in the law school admissions process. There are significantly more GRE test-takers each year than LSAT test-takers — that is because the GRE is used for many different fields of graduate study, whereas the LSAT is specifically tailored in order to measure the skills that law students need in particular. In recognition of that information, the LSAT should remain the standard to which law schools look when evaluating their candidates.
The fact that law school is not like other graduate education is common knowledge. A very specific skillset is required in order to excel in legal education, and the LSAT was designed precisely because of that. In fact, the LSAT is so well-designed that it is slightly better at predicting first-year law school grades than even a student’s own scholastic record. Without getting too absorbed in statistical jargon, the LSAT correlates with first-year grades moderately weakly, with a correlation coefficient of 0.4 (the closer a correlation coefficient is to 1, the stronger the relationship). A student’s record has a correlation coefficient of 0.38. A study sponsored by the agency that administers the GRE notes that the most predictive that the GRE gets for first-year graduate school grades is 0.39, and that is the correlation coefficient for a particular part of the test only. Thus, even when viewed in the best light, the GRE is not as accurate a predictor of scholastic success as the LSAT. Due to absent evidence that a GRE score is a better indicator of achievement in law school, there is not a compelling reason to accept the exam in place of the tried-and-true LSAT.
Anyone who has taken the LSAT knows just how different the exam is from typical standardized tests. The LSAT does not measure intuition, it measures the student’s ability to solve problems using deductive reasoning under extreme time constraints. Although there is a writing section at the end of the exam, it is not graded and serves primarily as a stylistic reference for the student’s writing. The GRE, on the other hand, measures “skills that have been developed over a long period of time and are not related to a specific field of study.” As such, these tests measure very different qualities. How a law school admissions committee could fairly compare different students who each took one distinct test is not immediately apparent — there isn’t exactly a conversion chart between skill types that they can reference.
The flaws of the LSAT, namely the barrier to entry due to cost and the ability of a student to study specifically for the exam, are unfortunate but not unique to the LSAT. In fact, the GRE has recently come under fire for exactly those reasons, with one professor of human development at Cornell University claiming that “the GRE is a proxy for asking ‘Are you rich?’ ‘Are you white?’ ‘Are you male?’”
The problem isn’t the LSAT. The problem is the nature of standardized tests themselves. Once a market for explaining the test exists, so will one for offering tutoring services, and the people who can afford those tutoring services will benefit. The exclusionary effect this has on individuals who have low incomes is admitted and unfortunate. However, this is why law school admissions go out of their way to use more than just the LSAT including GPA, writing samples, interviews and professional history as performance indicators.
The LSAT is not the sole determiner of law school admittance, but it is the best predictor of success currently on the market. In this way, the LSAT really does serve as the equalizer in law school admissions, and until a better test is devised, it should remain the only one that is accepted.

The LSAT is the furthest thing from an equalizer in law school admissions. 
Take two students, otherwise “equal” but with different economic backgrounds: The student who can afford hours of private tutoring or a fancy prep class will obviously score better on the test, increasing their chances of admission over their otherwise equal peer. 
Harvard Law School recently announced that it will accept GRE scores from applicants, allowing them to bypass the LSAT. This action will enhance the socioeconomic diversity of law school students by making the law school admissions process more about who deserves to get in, not who can afford pricey LSAT prep courses. 
In a pilot program starting in the Fall of 2017, Harvard Law School will allow applicants to submit results from either the GRE or the LSAT. The change comes a year after the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law made the same decision, sparking debate among legal professionals. Around 150 law school deans have supported the change, marking a shift in the field, which has long favored the LSAT as a major component of the application process.
The LSAT itself may be an excellent measure of a student’s readiness for law school, but the high cost of the exam and prep courses causes it to inherently favor wealthier students. After registering for the exam and paying to submit scores to schools, the LSAT costs a grand total of $355, compared to a registration fee of $205 and an additional $27 per school to submit scores for the GRE. 
As a political science major at USC, I am surrounded by students who plan on applying to law school. In class, I hear students casually exchange names of expensive tutors and top-of-the-line prep courses. I have friends who have taken time off school and their jobs to specifically study for the LSAT, presumably living solely off their parents’ income during this time period. 
While this may be a viable option for some, this culture excludes people who cannot afford the high price of prep courses, taking a break from work or even taking the LSAT more than once, and they suffer lower scores because of it. Spending obscene amounts of money on prep courses and tutors has become the norm, but it doesn’t have to be. Harvard’s decision shows that schools are starting to recognize the flaws with the LSAT system. 
Of course, similar flaws surround the GRE and other standardized tests. Some students will always be able to afford the relevant prep courses and others won’t. But at the very least, Harvard’s decision means that students will only need to pay for one expensive test. Many students already take the GRE as they consider graduate programs, or attend graduate school before applying to law school. Allowing students to submit these scores with their law school applications will reduce the amount of money they spend on these standardized tests.
In addition to improving socioeconomic diversity, scaling back the emphasis on LSAT scores also could increase the diversity of educational backgrounds in the legal profession. Because the GRE is used for admissions to a variety of graduate programs, students from fields such as science and engineering can easily use their scores to apply. In turn, this will help expand the legal profession, since lawyers themselves deal with the law across a wide spectrum of fields.
While the LSAT was created to measure skills needed for law school, this specificity is precisely what makes it so economically divisive. Because the types of questions aren’t those that would normally be found in school, students need to go out of their way to learn how to answer LSAT questions, hence the need for preparation. Meanwhile, the GRE measures “skills that have been developed over a long period of time,” allowing students who had minimal resources for test prep to utilize the skills they naturally developed during their undergraduate career.  The point remains that, under the current system, those who best display these law school-specific skills are frequently those who were simply able to spend the most time and money obtaining them.
Allowing students to submit GRE scores instead of LSAT scores may not be a perfect solution to the flaws with the LSAT. However, this is exactly why the Harvard pilot program is important. It could increase diversity in the legal field, and if the pilot is successful, other law schools should follow suit.

In an auditorium at Middlebury College packed with students on March 2, chants of “Who is the enemy? White supremacy” and “Racist, sexist, anti-gay: Charles Murray, go away!” drowned out Charles Murray, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, before he even began to speak.
Students have every right to protest perceived injustices. But by sweepingly labeling Murray for his controversial remarks in the past regarding race, they created yet another case of catchphrases trumping productive discourse.
As Middlebury Professor Allison Stranger, who identifies as a Democrat, wrote in a Facebook post responding to the event, inviting Murray to speak was meant “to demonstrate publicly a commitment to a free and fair exchange of views in my classroom.” However, students’ decision to bury Murray’s speech with their shouting and labeling rendered this impossible.
In the wake of the presidential election, a New York Times article entitled “The End of Identity Liberalism” bemoaned the rise of identity politics and the modification of policies and rhetoric to specific groups that stunts political discourse. In our current state, we run the risk of falling into a similar trap: By labeling one another as “fascist” or “snowflake,” we reinforce polarization and stagnate debate.  And in the case of Middlebury, recycling chants about Murray ignored the difficult but necessary discussion surrounding his work and past, especially considering his support for same-sex marriage and his rebuke of President Donald Trump.
Ultimately, it’s far easier and less productive to dismiss someone with the help of a catchy regurgitated phrase than to engage with them, their work, ideas, morals and worldview.
We conflate people with policy positions and come to sweeping generalizations. We attack people rather than beliefs or positions. Based on our new political vocabulary, cross-aisle dialogues no longer pit Democrats against Republicans or liberals against conservatives. Instead, it has shifted to “libertards” against “white supremacists,” “communists” against  “Trump supporters” or even “feminazis” against actual neo-Nazis. 
In many cases, the reality is not nearly as simple as these insults would denote. The result is a trench-like warfare where both sides hurl insults at one another from the safety of their own echo chambers, with no one willing to venture out of the “no man’s land” of bipartisanship and open dialogue.
 As the Red Scare in the 1950s proved, incriminating neighbors as communists or pinning them with other deeply stigmatized labels produces paranoia, hysteria, false alarms and real consequences.
Resorting to broad categorizations also tends to be counterproductive to the aims of the label-slinger. For example, branding someone as a fascist as a means to delegitimize their opinions can have the effect of shutting down productive discussion and negating an opportunity for education. On the other side of the aisle, brandishing the term “snowflake” to demarcate people as overly emotional is a cop-out that avoids engaging with the other side’s argument and acknowledging concerns over respecting marginalized groups.
College campuses and newsfeeds are laboratories where these forces collide. One only needs to look at college protests that escalate to violence or even the Daily Trojan’s comment section to see proof of where one-liners replace substance and even justify aggression.  It’s not uncommon for people to label socially conscious peers as “feminazis” or shrug at the use of such terms.  But as America’s largest generation, millennials need to transcend this rhetoric in order to build a future based on empathy and reason.  In the midst of a divisive political environment, coupled with data from CNN that reveals we are the “most polarized political group that the United States has seen in some time,” the stakes are too high.
Ultimately, words matter. It’s not just about the strength and morality of our arguments and how we package them — it’s about how we address each other across the political spectrum.
But that’s just the beginning. Once we move past categorizations and assumptions, we can and must engage in discussions of substance — in challenging each other’s positions and beliefs to not establish moral or intellectual superiority, but rather to gain new perspectives and insight that will lead to less polarization and better policy.
 This spring, citizens should consider cleaning out not just their closets but also their political vocabulary. There’s no need to recycle inflammatory rhetoric, and no need to donate labels to the next person. Spring is a time of renewal and rebirth — we ought to breathe life back into the national political dialogue.

Since I was a child I’ve always wanted to see cherry blossom (sakura) trees in person. I saw so much of them in movies, dramas and cartoons, and I’ve always wanted to know what it’s like to stand underneath the blooming trees and watch the pink-and-white petals float gently to the ground.
That’s why I was so thrilled when I found out that Los Angeles has cherry blossom trees and that March is the perfect time to see them. Knowing this, I made plans to see the cherry blossom trees at their peak.

Last week, I went to the Huntington Library, Art Collection and Botanical Gardens in Pasadena. The grounds include Japanese and Chinese gardens that have cherry blossom trees. As I made my way through the vast estate, I passed the Rose Garden, a quaint tea room, a few museums and a grand building that turned out to be the library.
I could see the pink treetops from far away. As I got nearer, I could smell the sweet, gentle scent of the cherry blossoms. A few steps later, I entered the gate leading to the Japanese garden, and it was one of the best sights I’ve ever seen.
There were stairs leading to a lake surrounded by cherry blossom trees. A traditional Japanese building stood on the other side, connected by a bridge across the water. A path wound its way between the trees, the flowers, the stone lanterns and the lake.

I watched the people there as I strolled leisurely around the garden. There were teenagers taking pictures with the flowers, old couples holding hands while looking at the water, families laughing as they walked together. At one point, a man asked me to take a picture while he proposed to his girlfriend under the gently swaying cherry blossom trees. Of course, she said, “Yes.”
If you want to see cherry blossom trees in Los Angeles, now is a good time to do it. The trees won’t stay in bloom for long. Other than the Japanese Gardens at the Huntington, there are other places in Los Angeles that offer cherry blossom viewing as well, including Descanso Gardens and the Suiho-En Japanese Garden.

Los Angeles County supervisors addressed community concerns regarding possible displacement of residents, public safety and environmental impact on communities affected by the expansion of the Keck School of Medicine of USC. 
The Los Angeles Board of Supervisors voted in favor of establishing the county’s first “Health Innovation Community Partnership” on March 14. 
The objective of the partnership is to engage area residents, community and civic leadership in the coordinated development of the Health Sciences Campus. 
“It is critical for the community impacted by the development of a Health Science District to play a role in determining its future,” said Isela Gracian, executive director of the East Los Angeles Community Corporation. “We anticipate that USC will participate along with community stakeholders and civil leaders in planning for world-class medical services and a biotech center that also lifts residents and communities to new levels of sustainability rather than push us out.”
More than 40 community leaders testified in favor of the expansion plans of the USC medical facilities. These plans include possible new dorms, parking structures, an additional hospital, a hotel and biotech labs. Potential uncoordinated development could lead to the displacement of residents in the surrounding neighborhoods leading to negative impacts on housing, children, family wellness and transportation. 
According to the press release, stakeholders called for more job opportunities, more affordable housing and educational opportunities related to science. 
“World class medical and biotech development in Los Angeles should happen,” said Maria Brenes, executive director of InnerCity Struggle at the press conference, “but not at the expense of residents’ quality of life, especially low-income communities that already face multiple cultural, health and economic inequalities.”
