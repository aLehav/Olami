A crowd of faculty and students stood silently, their heads bowed in a semi-circle around Tommy Trojan. Behind them, the American flag hung at half-mast, fluttering in a slight breeze. At noon Wednesday, the group had gathered for a time of remembrance and celebration for the life of former USC president Steven Sample, who died Tuesday. He was 75.
“Today we celebrate the life of an extraordinary man, a dear friend to all of us, a beloved colleague, a gifted scholar and a leader of international caliber,” President C. L. Max Nikias said, standing on a podium before the crowd. “Steven Sample has left a legacy on our University, on our Trojan family, our community and on America’s higher education.”
Throughout the next hour, the crowd listened as faculty and campus religious leaders praised Sample’s life and his impact on the university. The memorial served as the first step for the Trojan Family to begin healing from the loss of one of its most influential leaders.
In his 19 years as president, Sample transformed the national reputation of USC, improving the University’s diversity, outreach and competitiveness. When he came into office in 1991, USC suffered from a struggling reputation as the “University of Second Choice” — the back-up school for competitive students who were rejected from other universities.
Sample dedicated himself to changing that image, and in less than two decades, he succeeded. In 2000, Sample’s final year at USC, the middle 50 percent SAT scores had risen to 1,309. The acceptance rate had dropped under 24 percent, and a once majority-white student body had expanded to become one of the most racially diverse in the country.
Faculty pulled in twice as many research grants, and the University landed its first Nobel Prize. The USC that current students know — competitive, diverse, prestigious — is the University that Sample built.
“Under his exemplary leadership, USC rose dramatically in academic rankings to become one of the nation’s elite universities,” said Mark Ridley-Thomas, Los Angeles County supervisor and a USC graduate. “I will always cherish our friendship, which spanned more than 25 years.”
During Sample’s presidency, USC’s endowment rose to $4 billion before the recession hit, almost 10 times the initial $450 million endowment that existed when he took office. His Building On Excellence program raised more than $2.85 billion, allowing the University to expand many of its programs.
In 2000, after nine years of Sample’s presidency, Time Magazine named USC the College of the Year. He proudly had 600,000 copies of the article made.
“Every living Trojan got at least two copies,” Sample told the Chronicle of Higher Education. “Every dead Trojan got at least one.”
But Sample’s impact at USC extends beyond statistics and awards. He was the president who slept in his office and ate every meal in the dining halls during the L.A. riots, hoping to comfort the students left on campus. He served nine years after receiving a diagnosis of Parkinson’s that left a tremble in his left hand. He approached every personal interaction as a way to make the University better.
At a time when most of the country felt Los Angeles was dying, he dedicated himself to bettering both his University and the city surrounding it. He created the Good Neighbors Campaign and Neighborhood Academic Initiative to pour more funding into University Park and transform relations with the community for future generations.
And when he felt that he had reached a point when he couldn’t give USC the energy it deserved, Sample stepped aside with grace.
Sample devoted himself to every aspect of leadership, and those who worked with him remembered him as both a skilled leader and a devoted friend. Although Nikias’ words were tinged with grief, he encouraged the Trojans gathered on Wednesday to use Sample’s legacy to drive their own actions as they move forward.
“The story of Steve Sample passes forever into the loving memory of our worldwide Trojan family,” Nikias said. “It will remain powerfully alive, inspiring Trojans for generations to come, driving us all to bring out the best in ourselves, to sense great possibility as he did and to transform possibility into life-changing reality as he did.”
Sample is a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the author of The Contrarian’s Guide to Leadership, in which he dealt with his approach to leading at USC. Sample is survived by his wife, his daughters, Michelle and Elizabeth, and two grandchildren.

The Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives held its fourth campus climate open forum of the semester, focusing on diversity in USC faculty, hiring and retention.
The forum was moderated by Associate Professor at the School of Cinematic Arts Tara McPherson and featured a panel including George Sanchez, professor and vice dean for diversity at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences; Jody David Armour, professor at the Gould School of Law; Moira Turner, director of diversity affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government; and Cristina Gutierrez, vice president of the Graduate Student Government.
The event provided attendees with copies of a memorandum on diversity and statistics on diversity at USC, particularly numbers from Dornsife.
Sanchez opened with a discussion on how to adjust the hiring process for faculty at USC. He believes that making the statistics on faculty diversity internally transparent and hiring diverse assistant professors and young faculty members are the most important steps in improving future diversity.
“Whatever diversity we’re coming in the door with, if those folks stay, that’s what the future is going to look like,” Sanchez said. “We know what the current mismatch looks like, but my assumptions are that as the U.S. population diversifies further and further every year, we’re going to be at further of a mismatch when it comes to 2040.”
Currently, the administrative guidelines for hiring diverse faculty rest on one phrase — “cast a wide net.” Sanchez explained that because there isn’t a Target of Opportunity program, outlining specific goals, it is difficult for administrators and faculty members to make diverse hires.
He suggested setting goals through three specific types of programs — setting explicit goals of the number of underrepresented applicants to hire, committing to provost funding of the hiring of underrepresented applicants who make it to the final rounds of faculty hiring, or creating intellectual initiatives with the direct purpose of attracting underrepresented applicants.
After Sanchez concluded his part of the panel discussion, Armour continued on the topic of faculty inclusion. Instead of focusing on hiring, however, he spoke about the ways in which professors and faculty members of color are viewed in an academic setting.
Armour shared a story of a flyer that was released by the Gould School of Law that highlighted professors of merit in the school. Not a single professor of color was selected for the flyer. When this fact was pointed out, the faculty was surprised at their mistake.
“There wasn’t any ill will there,” Armour said. “It’s just we don’t really think about black folks or people of color as worthy of sitting on a finance committee and making these very nuanced judgements about intellectual merit.”
For this reason, Armour believes that there needs to be an active move to redefine the standard of excellence in academic settings at USC. He pointed out that women and people of color are often criticized much more harshly in course evaluations, and that the research of faculty members in these minorities is often slighted. Armour shared his own documentary, titled N-gga Theory, which he said was not accepted by non-minority peers for a long time.
“I’m teaching and writing with my head in the lion’s mouth,” Armour said. “And I know that. A lot of what I was doing was not recognized as scholarship. It took a long ride to get here.”
After both faculty members spoke, the panel discussion turned to its student members. Turner, a junior anthropology major, thanked the faculty for supporting open forums. She shared that it wasn’t until this year that she took a class from a professor of color, and the opportunity to learn and gain mentorship from a woman of color has helped her feel safer and more confident in her academic pursuits.
“My mentor has been not only quintessential to my development as a fledgling scholar,” Turner said. “She’s also been my refuge when being a black woman on campus is too difficult to handle.”
Turner explained that the lack of professors of color at USC makes it difficult for students of color to feel comfortable and accepted in academic settings. Although most of her peers who are also minorities have interacted with one or two professors of color, she said that it is often difficult for students to find a mentor who shares their identity. That is even more true for students in STEM fields, where faculty members rarely represent diverse backgrounds.
Gutierrez, a graduate student, finished out the panel discussion. She began by pointing out the lack of administration presence at the event — with only two deans and one associate provost present — and called for more administrative attention to be applied to the issue of diversity.
The panel discussion was followed by the open forum section of the event, which allowed the students and faculty assembled to discuss the issue in depth. The forum is part of a series of campus climate discussions which have taken place this semester, hosted by the Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives.
There will be one more open forum this semester on April 20. This forum will discuss financial aid and admissions, and will take place in the Mudd Hall of Philosophy.
Does USC also value Viewpoint Diversity?  While slow, it seems like progress is being made on Race, Culture and even Gender diversity.  Shouldn’t we also be giving voice and equal opportunity to those with diverse Ideas?
Merriam Webster defines ‘Diversity’ as the quality or state of having many different forms, types, ideas, etc.
the state of having people who are different races or who have different cultures in a group or organization.

Earlier this month, an online donation drive for people affected by the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, was created by Amaka Agodi, a sophomore studying health promotion and disease prevention studies. The GoFundMe was started on March 4 and has relied on small donations from fellow college students. Agodi hopes to bring attention to the crisis to students on campus who may not be aware.
The Flint environmental and health crisis began in April 2014, when the Michigan state government began sourcing water for the town from the polluted Flint River instead of Lake Huron to reduce costs. Studies have found the river water to be corrosive, and service pipes made of lead are leaching the toxic chemical into the water supply.
A study conducted by the Virginia Institute of Technology found that the levels of lead found in household water sources would constitute it as “toxic waste.” The study targets the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality as the bearer of the responsibility of the crisis. It also speaks to the permanent and long-lasting effects of such negligence.
“The consequences of lead exposure for Flint residents are expected to be long-term and will necessitate sustained investments in education, public and mental health, juvenile justice and nutrition needs over the next 10 to 20 years,” the study said.
Agodi learned about the water crisis from Twitter and she felt the need to respond. Agodi used her platform as a student to spread word of the incident and to reach out to other activists.
“I’m a very avid Twitter user. I saw people talking about the crisis in Flint,” Agodi said. “I noticed that someone from Justice League NYC had posted something about her company, who were going to help the people there. So I emailed her as a USC student and told her I was thinking of doing this donation drive for USC to help raise money.”
Agodi said that her donation drive was a spur-of-the-moment decision and she wants to make sure that those unaware of the crisis understand the situation.
“I figured out everything about a month and a half ago, so everything I’m doing is kind of spur-of-the-moment,” Agodi said. “A friend recommended that I start a GoFundMe, including as much information as I could because I wanted people to understand the gravity.”
Recently, the tragedy has been viewed through a political lens. In 2014, when the crisis began, 57 percent of Flint residents were African American and 42 percent of all residents lived below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Media outlets such as TIME, The New York Times and CNN have commented on the racialized nature of the crisis and compared it to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
Agodi also acknowledged this aspect of the crisis, and spoke on the environmental racism she believes is happening at Flint today because of a lack of empathy.
“If something doesn’t affect people, in their community, then it doesn’t mean anything,” Agodi said. “And if it’s not something that happening to someone that looks like them, then they don’t care.”
Agodi wants students at USC and other elite universities to use their standing to help those in need in Flint.
“I was trying to use my privilege of being a student in a well-established university to try jump-start something.” Agodi said. ”I’m kind of happy with the feedback I’ve got with people trying to get involved, but it’s also disheartening that people just don’t know what’s going on.”
Agodi held an event on Saturday evening in support of the drive, raising $1,012. Including the $500 raised from the GoFundMe, the donation drive for Flint has, in total, raised $1,422. The GoFundMe is still active and can be found online.

Kaya Press and The (Great) Indian Poetry Collective hosted the workshop Lit in Color Write-A-Thon in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Wednesday, attracting writers and enthusiasts of writing. The workshop promoted the Asian-American diaspora of poetry, fiction and nonfiction and aims to hold space for anyone interested in writing, creativity and community.
The workshop is an off-site event of the Association of Writers and Writing Programs — the nation’s largest writing conference and book fair happening at the Los Angeles Convention Center —  and is expected to attract around 12,000 writers from around the world. The five-hour rotating workshop helped  attendees create ideas to counter writer’s block and giving people the tools to create. The line-up included poet and Ph.D. student Douglas Manuel from the (Great) Indian Poetry Collective as well as Minal Hajratwala, Shikha Malaviya, Ellen Kombiyil, Tananarive Due, April Naoko Heck, Sofia Samatar, Paul Hlava, D’Lo, Kristina Wong, Samiya Bashir and Erika Wurth.
“It’s a great way for people to generate ideas for any fiction and writings,” said Anita Chen, president of the student organization branch of the Kaya Press publishing company, Kaya Students for Independent Publishing, and a senior majoring in narrative studies major. “It’s an emerging platform for voices of the Asian-Pacific diaspora to be heard, and also unites people of color.”
“It’s wonderful to have so many writers giving advice, and there’s always something to learn,” said Soniah Kamal, Townsend Prize for Fiction award nominee for An Isolated Incident. “An idea can come from anywhere, and it’s always fun to write from different perspective.”
Neela Banerjee, managing director of Kaya Press and organizer of the workshop, said that it was important to bring in leaders of color.
“It’s a great platform to draw attention to writers and bring workshop leaders of color,” Banerjee said .
The workshop invited poets like Malaviya, a poet and writer who’s been writing for nearly 20 years. One of her most notable works include Geography of Tongues, a poetry collection. She has also given talks for TEDx in Golf Links Parkin Bangalore.
“It’s really special that we rarely get to see many writers in a same day, and it’s always worth it to get out of  comfort zone,” Shikha said.

USC hosted the annual Veritas Forum discussion on Wednesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom, “Work Hard, Play Hard, Now What?” that focused on themes of God, success and whether or not the meaning of life extends past just professional accomplishments and social validation.
The forum featured guest speakers Adlai Wertman, a professor of clinical entrepreneurship at the Marshall School of Business, and Charles Lee, Moghadam Family Professor of Management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The event was moderated by Ange-Marie Hancock, associate professor of political science and gender studies in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“To me, the reason I could ever call myself accomplished or successful is the impact I have on others. It has nothing to do with my bank account or house,” Wertman said. “The truth, success isn’t a head conversation, it’s a heart conversation and we need to get quiet to figure that one out.”
The Veritas Forum, founded at Harvard University in 1992, is a university event curated by professors and students with the mission of breaking down and exploring difficult questions in life in the context of faith. Last year’s forum discussed race, empathy and faith.
The forum, hosted by student organizations across 200 campuses in the nation, aims to ask “why” questions — questions involving social justice and human rights in conjunction with faith, and open the discussion for students of all backgrounds on campus to engage in dialogue.
Larissa Purnell, president of the Marshall Business Student Government and the Pastoral Council at the USC Caruso Catholic Center, introduced the event in an opening speech.
“I’d also like to dedicate this night in honor of the passing of USC President Emeritus Steven Sample. Through countless initiatives he introduced to our university, such as the Renaissance Scholars program and the Office of Religious Life, his visionary leadership will continue to encourage student to pursue the roots of our sources of knowledge and our sense of truth,” Purnell said.
The final portion of the forum was a Q&A, where the speakers got to answer questions and engage directly with the students and audience members about religion and the meaning of life. The audience had opportunities to ask them a large range of questions regarding business and religion, as well as professional and personal pursuits.
“Being that many USC students are business majors and minors, I think the topic is extremely relevant to the large and diverse student population at USC,” said Brian Chung, religious director of Intervarsity Trojan Christian Fellowship. “I was a USC student before, and now working with many USC students, I realize that we do have a work-hard, play-hard mentality, and I love how the forum is pressing is to think about, is there more to it than that?”
Although Veritas is a Christian organization, the organization’s goal is to extend the conversation to audiences of all backgrounds to come together and participate.
Laura Ziesel, West Coast regional director of the Veritas Forum, highlighted the significance of the Veritas forum to both religious and non-religious students in addition to its importance in light of the recent death of Sample.
“We seek to create a space and invite people who don’t usually come to events that are hosted by Christians. We really want to model for students how to have a conversation with people with different viewpoints,” Ziesel said. “As the campus mourns the legacy of Steven Sample right now, we believe that this is something that honors him and does a good service to his legacy.”
The Veritas Forum at USC “plans, hosts and coordinates conversation events, seminar series, and forums which allow exploration of true life,” according to the official website. This year’s forum was co-sponsored by Marshall’s Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab, MBSG, Intervarsity Graduate Christian Fellowship, El Centro Chicano, CRU, Caruso Catholic Center, Asian Pacific American Student Services, USC Hillel, Intervarsity Trojan Christian Fellowship, LaFe, Christian Challenge, South LA Christian Life and Young Life.

After dominating teams out on the West Coast, the USC beach volleyball team, the defending national champion, will test their luck out in South Beach, Florida, this weekend when they take part in the fourth annual Surf and Turf Classic hosted by Florida International University.
The No. 2-ranked Women of Troy (11-2) will be making the cross-country trek to Miami, to play six teams in a span of just 28 hours, headlined by matches against No. 8-ranked Georgia State, No. 9-ranked Stetson and No. 10-ranked FIU.
This busy slate of action isn’t new for head coach Anna Collier, who purposely fit the tournament into her schedule in order to give the team a sense of what it’s like to play in Alabama at the NCAA Championships.
“The reason why I [scheduled] this is because Miami is similar to Gulf Shores’ wind, sand and weather,” Collier said. “It’s great preparation for NCAAs. It’s great competition, and it’s still early enough for us to see what we need to do to mentally and physically prepare for these types of games moving forward.”
Starting off the tournament on Friday, USC will take on eighth-ranked Georgia State (14-2) at 12 p.m. EST. The Panthers have won seven duals in a row, while USC is riding its own seven-match winning streak. The Women of Troy will then tussle with South Carolina (13-5) at 3 p.m. ET, followed by a match against Tulane (10-6) at 5 p.m. EST. to close out the first day of action.
On Saturday, USC will battle No. 9-ranked Stetson at 9 a.m. EST. The Hatters currently lead the nation in wins with a 16-4 record. Stetson is also the only team in the field that USC has faced before, with the Women of Troy winning all three prior meetings. USC will then face 10th-ranked host Florida International (5-6) at 12 p.m. ET. The final match of the tournament will be against Florida Atlantic (6-7) at 2 p.m. EST.
Set to lead USC is the No. 1 pair of juniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes, who have won 41 straight matches. The duo has only lost six sets during that streak and currently sit at a perfect 16-0 on the season. However, they might be facing their stiffest competition this weekend. Something will have to give when the two face off against Stetson, as the Hatters’ number one pair of Vendy Strakova and Sara Putt are also undefeated at 19-0 on the season, while Georgia State’s top pair of Sara Olivova and Jansen Button hold steady at 15-1 overall.
Another USC pair that has played well as of late has been the No. 4 tandem of sophomore Jenna Belton and freshman Abril Bustamante. Both were recently named Pac-12 Pair of the Week, marking the third time that a USC pair has won the award in four weeks. In seven matches together, the underclassmen have gone 14-2 in sets.
According to Belton, the two have grown steadily throughout the season thanks to hard work and trust.
“Playing with Abril has been awesome,” Belton said. “We’ve improved a ton and made really great leaps together. We had a rough start, but ever since then, our record has improved, and it’s because our communication and dynamic on the court has gotten better.”
Bustamante is the lone freshman in USC’s starting lineup, but has enjoyed the transition into the college game with Belton by her side.
“It has definitely been something new, but I’m really enjoying it and loving the team,” Bustamante said. “It’s different than high school because there’s more hours to put in and a lot more to juggle, but it’s been so fun.”
Collier also thinks her young guns were well-deserving of the recognition.
“I’m happy for them,” Collier said. “In the beginning, they were struggling … A freshman and a sophomore? That’s young. This shows how much they’ve grown together. They’re playing better and more consistently. Abril and Jenna have really worked on their partnership, and they’re understanding what each other needs to win matches.”
Despite the hectic month of March, Collier has been pleased with her team’s performance during this jam-packed midseason schedule and is looking forward to the opportunity to improve this weekend.
“We’re playing well, but the biggest piece is that we’re competing much better,” Collier said. “I still think we haven’t seen our best volleyball yet, which is actually exciting because that gives us the chance to play our best volleyball going forward.”

The women’s lacrosse team (9-0) hits the road to take on Fresno State (3-7) on Thursday at 5 p.m.
The Women of Troy have climbed to No. 7 in the country after continuing to impress over the course of the season. Now at the halfway mark of the campaign, USC will square off against a Bulldogs team desperate for a victory. Fresno State has lost four straight, including an 8-7 overtime loss at San Diego State this weekend.
The two teams have a handful of common opponents, including Stetson and Oregon. USC clobbered Stetson in the season opener in a 21-2 rout, while Fresno State won 14-6 over the Hatters. But Oregon was a different story for Fresno State. USC demolished the Ducks, 17-4, at McAlister Field last weekend, but Fresno State fell 15-10 when they traveled to Eugene.
USC is Fresno State’s highest-ranked opposition since the Bulldogs met then-No. 4 Florida in 2012.
Speaking of Florida, the Gators are No. 2 in the country right now, second best only to Maryland. The Terps occupy the top spot in the rankings with a perfect 8-0 record.
Something stands out when sifting through the top 20 rankings. While the usual suspects are present and accounted for, USC one of just two teams with an unbeaten record.
If the Trojans continue to play at this level, it will be a serious threat to bring home the hardware come season’s end. The team takes things one game at a time, though, and not a single player on the roster will underestimate Fresno State.
The Bulldogs’ depth could be an issue against USC, seeing as they typically only work some four or five substitutes into the action. The Women of Troy, meanwhile, mix it up quite well and get solid performances from non-starters.
USC’s balanced attack, which senior attacker Caroline deLyra praised after the win over Oregon, has given opponents major problems so far. Junior attacker Michaela Michael is leading the charge with her 39 goals, but the assist-machine deLyra finds countless ways to find her teammates in dangerous areas.
USC’s depth, versatile attack and sheer momentum at the moment point to another blowout win. However, what makes this team great is its perpetual desire to improve. These players refuse to let any hint of complacency hold them back, which is a beautiful thing for head coach Lindsey Munday and the faithful at McAlister Field.
Following Thursday’s match, the Trojans will take on San Diego State at home on Saturday afternoon.

St. Patrick’s Day, a holiday usually reserved for luck, was anything but for the No. 8-seeded Trojans as they dropped their first round contest of the 2016 NCAA tournament 70-69 to the Providence Friars.
In the wake of their heartbreaking last-second loss, there is still much to hope for next year.
Although it is phrase most famously championed by Chicago Cubs fans, both the Cubs and the Trojans have the opportunity to make deep playoff runs. For the latter, 10 players will be returning from their 2015 roster, including two practice team players in walk-on junior guard Kurt Karis and Louisville transfer sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron who both sat out this past year.
This postseason feeling should not be for disappointment, but for confidence and anticipation for even bigger experiences next season.
Considering that many had the Trojans not making the tournament, let alone sweeping UCLA, the 2016-2017 campaign should be the most anticipated season in nearly a decade.
Looking at the projected 2016 roster, the Trojans have as much talent as any team in the nation.
In the paint, USC just lost two big forces in junior forward Darion Clark and sophomore forward Malik Martin, who each plan to transfer to other Division I schools. Although Martin was highly recruited out of high school, he disappointed in his two seasons with the Trojans. The 6-foot-7 Clark was undersized, but underrated considering his exceptional rebounds-per-minute statistic amidst a team with five players 6-foot-9 or taller.
Clark and Martin’s absences will affect the team, but not necessarily in a negative way.
Freshmen forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu, two 6-foot-11 players with shooting and rebounding abilities, now have the opportunity to become the Trojans’ primary big men in 2016.
The interesting situation with the Trojans is not that they don’t have enough talent at the moment, but that they have too much talent. And while some may see this as a problem in terms of losing players or team chemistry, from a coaching perspective, this is the best thing that could happen to the Men of Troy.
Considering the Trojans won nearly as many games in 2015 as they did in 2013 and 2014 combined, the fact that they were able to collect three top recruits in Jonah Mathews, De’Anthony and Harrison Henderson was something nobody could have predicted when head coach Andy Enfield first arrived in Los Angeles.
Nearly every player on the court can make shots. Boatwright, sophomore guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart, and junior guard Katin Reinhardt, combined for 236 3-pointers last season, shooting 39 percent combined.
With Reinhardt transferring, however, there will be an opportunity for another off-the-bench shooting guard to step up. Stewart will most likely earn the starting guard spot with his consistent shooting ability.
The Trojans can play defense when they want to, but the problem down the stretch last season was that they could not do so with consistency. After all, it was their lack of defense on the final play against Providence in the first round of the NCAA tournament which allowed Rodney Bullock to score.
This season was outstanding, but with the added maturity that the Pac-12 and NCAA tournament brought to the Trojans, 2016 should include a much deeper postseason run.
You left out DeAnthony’s last name which is Melton. Henderson is a project which leaves only Metu and Jovanovich to
handle the inside paint. None of the three new recruits made the McDonalds AA team game  yesterday in Chicago.

The No. 9 men’s tennis team comes back to Marks Stadium after over a month on the road for two back-to-back conference matches against No. 16 Cal on Friday and No. 36 Stanford on Saturday.
USC is 11-4 overall and 1-1 in the Pac-12 after losing 4-3 to Washington on Friday and beating Oregon 4-3 on Sunday.
The Trojans have four singles player ranked nationally. At No. 25 is senior captain Max de Vroome, currently enjoying the best ranking of his college career. No. 55 is junior Nick Crystal, followed three spots behind at No. 58 by freshman Logan Smith. Another freshman, Jake deVine ranks at No. 109. The only doubles pair is composed by Crystal and freshman Laurens Verboven, currently at No. 38.
The first opponent for the Trojans is No. 16 Cal on Friday. The Golden Bears are 10-3 on the season and undefeated in the Pac-12 after beating Arizona 4-0 and Utah 4-3 last week.
Four Cal players are currently ranked nationally in singles. At No. 17 is junior Andre Goransson, followed at No. 28 by junior Florian Lakat. At No. 40 is sophomore Billy Griffith, while at No. 62 is senior Oskar Wikberg. The Golden Bears have two doubles pairs in the rankings as well.

One More Time has great acting from Amber Heard and Christopher Walken, a fantastic soundtrack and a fresh take on the tried but true theme of a hectic family. The movie’s focus is sometimes cloudy, but not enough to distract the viewer from the mostly well-developed relationships in the movie.
The movie follows Jude Lombard, played by Heard, coming to live with her father after feeling unsatisfied by her unfulfilling singing career and turbulent life. This doesn’t exactly help her situation, however, as she has to deal with the myriad complications at her father’s house. This includes her successful and stable sister, Corinne, played by Kelli Garner; her new stepmom, Lucille, played by Ann Magnuson, who represents just another unsuccessful marriage waiting to happen; and last but certainly not least, her father, Paul, played by Walken, who is a famous Sinatra-like singer whose glory days are behind him.
Heard’s performance as Jude is wonderful. It’s admittedly typical of what to expect with a hipster character such as hers, but she plays it well. Everything from Jude’s snarky comments and eye-rolls down to her difficulty in coming to terms with the major self-destructive tendencies in her life all seem authentic coming from Heard.
She does especially well in scenes with Walken. The rocky relationship between Jude and Paul feels authentic and fresh, and is a definite highlight of the movie. There are many moments during the movie where it doesn’t feel like two actors putting emotion behind lines that they didn’t write, but it rather feels like a wounded daughter and an insecure father trying to develop a working relationship that keeps suffering from each other’s inability to grow up.
Walken seems like a natural fit for the role of Paul. His performance is very reserved, to the point where it’s off-putting at first, but it becomes more and more believable as the movie progresses. Walken’s ability to play a former star that is trying to stay relevant in the world of music can be seen as a parallel to his own life, since his days as a star are seemingly behind him. His insecurities and knack for pushing those who are close to him away are explored through his relationships, which comes across as natural on screen. It’s uncharacteristic to see Walken in a role like this, but he does a good job with it. The biggest surprise from this performance, however, is his ability to sing.
The movie puts an emphasis on the music, and it’s a fantastic choice that the movie ultimately benefits from. Walken sings a couple of numbers in the movie, including a duet with Heard, who sings a few numbers herself. Both have great voices that are true to their characters. Walken croons about love and new chances, while Heard has a folksy sound. Music plays an interesting role for the characters, both being a source of unhappiness and joy. Paul owes his fortune to his career, but his family has suffered for it.
This presents itself in a number of ways in the movie. The most notable is with his daughter, Jude, who struggles with her own music career because she doesn’t want to become famous on account of who her dad is. She and her sister also have to deal with the consequences of having a famous singer for a dad, which has affected them since their childhood and continues to in the present day. Corinne also suffers, despite being more successful than Jude, as she doesn’t get as much attention from her dad as her sister does. While it is interesting, this plot point seems to lose steam the more the movie goes on, and it is never truly wrapped up. Regardless, this fresh take on a dysfunctional family feels fresh and pays more attention to the influence a father has over his children’s lives and how his actions not only have consequences for him, but for everyone around him as well.
One More Time doesn’t tie up all of the loose ends as it unravels, but it is a heartwarming, modern take on how even a dysfunctional family is an invaluable support system. Heard and Walken play their roles well enough to be remembered hours after the credits have rolled, and the soundtrack is both enjoyable to listen to and plays a key role in the film. It’s a good indie movie for those who are looking for an emotional journey with a powerful tone.

Miss India America is a coming-of-age comedy that will satisfy viewers young and old. Directed by British-Indian director Ravi Kapoor, the film stars up-and-coming actress Tiya Sircar as over-achieving protagonist Lily Prasad. She is joined by fellow actresses Hannah Simone and Kosha Patel. With a cast and crew comprised of mainly South Asian actors, Miss India America pays a hilarious, but honorable homage to the cross-cultural values of Indian-American youths.
The film follows high school valedictorian Lily Prasad, who has never had a difficult day in her life. Successful, attractive and in full control of her own fate, Lily believes she has it all until her dream boyfriend, Karim, leaves her for a stereotypical beauty queen. Enraged because she planned her entire life with Karim in a book, Lily decides to compete in the Miss India Golden State pageant and is determined to win back his affection with her own crown. With the help of her best friend, Seema, Lily gets back in touch with her Indian roots by training in various tasks, such as wearing a sari and performing in traditional Indian dances. In order to win the pageant, Lily dedicates herself to connecting with her culture. Despite her competitive relationship with fellow pageant contender Sonia and her determination to triumph over others, Lily realizes in the end that she found what she had lost long ago — a love for her culture.
Miss India America is a campy and enjoyable comedy film. With countless cultural references and hysterical situations, the film aims to connect with youths who are, in a way, stuck between two cultures. Though slightly obvious in terms of comedic conventions, the film demonstrates the enormous potential of the filmmakers and actors in the small but growing South Asian-American acting community. Sircar does a phenomenal job at portraying an image of the classic over-achiever, who gains a sense of her own identity after competing in the pageant, despite the actions she takes to win.
A particularly notable scene in the film is when Lily convinces her best friend Seema to drop out of the pageant so she can enter it. This is a perfect representation of Lily’s over-dominating ambitions at the beginning of the film. The writers of the film, Kapoor and his wife, Meera Simhan, did a particularly wonderful job of weaving together characters in the film and connecting them with quirky, relatable references to those who have an understanding of Indian-American culture. Interestingly, Simhan based this screenplay on her personal experiences competing in an Indian-American pageant contest, according to her interview with the Los Angeles Times.
The film has received a considerable amount of praise. At the 2015 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, Kapoor and Simhan won an award for their screenplay of this film. Though not perfect or completely relatable, Kapoor and Simhan’s Miss India America has made a tremendous impact on Hollywood’s cultural barriers. By creating an entire film based on South Asian-American youth and culture, Kapoor has done the much-needed task of showcasing the hidden, but amazing, talents of today’s diverse actors and
actresses.
Miss India America will be released on Digital HD and On Demand April 5.

In the wake of the success of Zootopia, Disney’s latest animated hit, many young children has Shakira’s soundtrack single “Try Everything” constantly echoing in their heads. An upbeat pop song rhythmically encouraging children to take risks and not be afraid of failure, “Try Everything” is just the most recent addition to film’s beloved tradition of producing marketable singles.
Anyone alive during the era of Frozen, which hopefully everyone reading this is, because if not, you are a very intelligent toddler, remembers the “Let It Go” takeover. Everyone from the child down the street to Channing Tatum on Lip Sync Battle belted the song with everything they had. Back in 2010, Avril Lavigne contributed to Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland movie with a song entitled “Alice.” The mid-tempo ballad features a positive message of survival amid the very Alice references.
It’s not just films affiliated with Disney; Lorde proved her critical acclaim valid when she took over the job of curating The Hunger Games soundtrack. Her single, “Yellow Flicker Beat,” echoed many of the same messages film singles often do, but with the queen of dark teen pop’s touch.
Whether it’s a tune penned by a famous artist, an underground anthem or a Disney-style organized musical number, the past 10 years of mainstream soundtrack singles tend to have one thing in common: hope. From dystopian battle cries about overcoming life-or-death struggles to child-friendly tales teaching confidence or strength, film singles often encapsulate a movie’s entire message in three minutes. Listeners can go from walking to class to marching against a tyrannical government with the press of the play button. When you’re down about finals or social drama, a click of the mouse puts on a dance beat that reminds you to keep on keepin’ on.
Stepping away from the kids/teen films, soundtracks still feature that one song that brings to mind a montage of scenes whenever played. The James Bond franchise is a perfect example of how a single can be just as big of a deal as the movie itself. From Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall” to Adele’s “Skyfall,” even those who never saw the movie can still hum a few bars. John Legend and Common’s “Glory” from Selma was an emotional piece that spoke to an entire era of struggle and pain. Separate from the movie, the film’s messages and themes were told in three minutes and nine seconds.
The soundtrack has been recognized as a key component in a film’s success for a long time. Swelling symphonies or grunged out rock ‘n’ roll can give poignant scenes that much more power. But the individual single, sometimes not even incorporated into the movie, acts as a trailer for what’s to come or a reminder of what you experienced. Music is a powerful tool for expanding the boundaries of film — a combination of media that strikes home the intended ideas. And the truth is, yes, I’ve rocked out to “Try Everything”  multiple times in the car since seeing the movie. I don’t care that I’m not the 12-year-old kid Disney probably had in mind, because the fact of the matter is, we all need to be reminded to try everything despite the risk of failure. Even more so, we all need that little portable piece to carry around with us that reminds us of the way we felt in the theater. It’s not just a song; it’s a connection to an entire cinematic experience.

Gayle Kirschenbaum, famous for her HBO documentary, A Dog’s Life: A Dogamentary, turns the camera on her own family for her newest documentary, Look At Us Now, Mother!. Kirschenbaum puts a big fat disclaimer just as the film begins: “Most of this footage was taken for home video purposes and never intended for an audience.”
However, she felt compelled to share the story after a breakthrough with her mother in therapy. With most popular documentaries focusing on intense subjects like the ill treatment of animals or how the food industry is killing us all, Look at Us is a refreshingly relatable film that doesn’t prompt any letter-writing campaign or crying over humanity. It hits anyone with a parent hard. Don’t be surprised if you hear, “My mom totally does that,” whispered under everyone’s breath for the duration of the hour and 24-minute film.
Here’s the gist: Gayle has a rough relationship with her mother. She brings together footage spanning from her early childhood to the present day that showcases just how, uh, endearing her mother can be. Mrs. Kirschenbaum — Mildred — shouts insults like, “Get a nose job!”; “When are you getting married?”; “You’re abusive!”
Gayle digs deeper into her childhood. She remembers the time she came home an hour past her strict 10 p.m. curfew: Her mother threw a cold glass of water at her face and proceeded to tell her, “I don’t care if you get raped, if you weren’t already.” That’s not something heard every day. Kirschenbaum’s mother is loud, Jewish and always gets her way. A similar comparison is the popular “Crazy Jewish Mom” Instagram account that has amassed more than 800,000 followers. Despite the shocking stories told, the film is not about bad relationships — it’s more interested in repairing them.
The camera follows Gayle and Mildred into their first-ever joint therapy session. The psychologist asks Mildred why she loved tormenting Gayle as a child and her response was, “I don’t remember that.” That was her response to most of the complaints Gayle brought up.
The film also captures the mother-daughter duo in France when Gayle had her “dogumentary” in a festival. The two traveling is just as horrific as anyone can imagine. In a later therapy scene that serves as the film’s climax, Mildred finally apologizes to Gayle and asks for forgiveness. Gayle’s reply is ,“I have to forgive you, otherwise we won’t have a relationship.” What is important about this moment is that the answer is not “because I love you” or “because I think you’re being sincere”; it’s because if she doesn’t forgive her mother, they’ll become like every other senior parent and adult child who don’t talk anymore. This is a truth that seems to be forgotten in film and television today, despite having significant impact for audiences.
The film isn’t perfect. The scenes are choppy, the camera quality is low, and the narrative winds seemingly without direction. Keep in mind that this documentary wasn’t supposed to be made. It was born out of the need to tell a story of forgiveness with the world. It takes courage to base a script off of a personal experience, but it takes even more courage to bring the audience inside a home. Look At Us Now, Mother! may not be taking home an Oscar anytime soon, but that shouldn’t matter. It tells the quiet story that no matter how flawed a family might be, there’s always hope.

The Office of the Provost released a memorandum that announced USC’s membership in the Institute of International Education Syria Consortium for Higher Education Friday. The University will provide scholarships each academic year for at least three Syrian graduate students in an effort to be a “leading private institution dedicated to the global public good.” The memorandum went on to say “it is important that we not only cultivate a safe haven for these displaced scholars and students but that we afford them every opportunity to succeed in their academic endeavors here.”
While it is commendable that the University joined the consortium, it is disappointing that the scholarship and recruitment efforts will be limited to graduate students only. Certainly, undergraduate recruitment has a unique set of obstacles. But if 58 other institutions of higher education in the IIE Syria Consortium can find qualified undergraduate students, USC should be just as capable.
Last December, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate rejected a resolution that called for USC to sign onto the consortium. The resolution at the time was backed by 38 campus organizations and more than 60 faculty members and was also passed in the GSG Senate. There were two main arguments against the resolution — that passing the resolution would make for a “divisive” campus climate and that recruiting undergraduate students during one of the greatest humanitarian crises in the 21st century is difficult.
Nine senators signed a letter prior to voting on the resolution which said that they “support the goals expressed in the resolution.” Yet, in the Senate minutes, they did not feel comfortable speaking on behalf of their constituents after the November Paris attacks.
Conflating a humanitarian crisis with an issue of national security not only assassinates the character of Syrian students but also paints these senators as apathetic and ignorant. According to GSG Sen. Christopher Lo-Records, who advocated for the resolution, the vetting process for refugees is comprehensive. In fact, he mentioned in his proposal that the United States has accepted 750,000 refugees since 9/11 without any threats to national security. That being said, no effort for undergraduates to be included in the IIE Syria Consortium has been made clear, and I find that unacceptable.
This is most likely because of the logistical, financial and linguistic barriers to the undergraduate recruitment and admissions. Due to the severity of the civil war, most Syrians have been out of school for the past five years. The logistical obstacles stemming from this makes undergraduate admissions for Syrian refugees more complex than it is for their graduate counterparts. Many high school or college students were ousted from their normal lives and, in the process, were unable to receive academic transcripts and test scores critical to university admissions. How does a university like USC admit students with little understanding of their academic backgrounds without compromising the legitimacy of the institution and the standards for admission?
Fortunately, there are many avenues to ensure the quality and academic promise of refugee students that surpass the confines of a traditional admissions process. A great example of unconventional, but successful recruitment is the Jusoor Scholarship Program, which is open to Syrian women who have demonstrated “exemplary social service with leadership, academic excellence, and civic responsibility, who have characteristics reflecting the importance of empathy, humility, courage and resilience, and who have potential to serve as global leaders,” according to Jusoor. This scholarship program feeds students to its key partner institutions — the Institute for International Education, Illinois Institute of Technology, EducationUSA and Monmouth College, all of which are part of the consortium.
According to the IIE and UC Davis, about 200,000 Syrians are currently displaced from higher education despite finding refuge in the countries surrounding Syria. Regardless, Syrian youth have proven to be resilient in the face of civil war and displacement; certainly, students of this caliber have skill sets not found in the average Trojan and can make the University a more diverse and competitive institution of higher education.
USC has taken the first step in addressing this issue and what it plans to do for graduate students is truly remarkable. However, the University should look into alternative ways to provide the same opportunities for undergraduate students. USC accepts well over 18,000 undergraduate students every year, offering generous scholarships and financial aid packages. USC should offer a few of those spots to Syrian youth who otherwise would have very little chance at getting an education.
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a band-aid on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as friends.

This week the denizens of the internet did what they do best and wrecked it for the rest of us. Sadly, one of the pranks centered on demeaning fellow humans, which seems to still have a place in 2016.
First up, the Natural Environment Research Center of the United Kingdom released a poll to name their latest $287 million research vessel. The current frontrunner is “Boaty McBoatface,” with a little less than 10 times the number of votes as the second choice. Cute.
Later in the week, Microsoft released “Tay AI” onto Twitter, a teen girl, AI, designed to chat up users and learn from what other users tweet. Cue the internet. A day later, Microsoft had to take down Tay, who had become “a Hitler-loving sex robot,” according to The Telegraph. Oops.
Boaty McBoatface is great. It’s an embodiment of the best British humor. Tay is not. Funny because it is unexpected, perhaps, but these jokes are at the expense of every nation, group or individual that felt the 140-character wrath of the uncensored bot.
Look, we get it: Making computer programs do what their users never intended is funny and interesting. There are legions of YouTube videos of players building elaborate buildings, recreating memes or recreating characters from popular culture. The best of these aren’t racist, sexist or misogynistic, but stand on their own as enticing cross-platform intersections of what people love best, approachable for all. Tay could have been that.
Tay instead illustrates the power that a group of determined, intolerant individuals can have on public outcomes. This may sound familiar: a small group, with hatred in their hearts, espouses their views while others look on and laugh. Eventually, their rhetoric becomes overwhelming, and a wider audience stops laughing and starts pointing out the damage these remarks cause but are unable to dissuade the growing bigoted cohort. Eventually, the unceasingly intolerant rhetoric becomes mainstream and acceptable. Jokes turn to ingrained ideas, words turn to violence and the whole histories of nations and peoples irrevocably change. There are any number of scenarios, both past and present, to which that story applies. Luckily, Microsoft nipped this one in the bud.
Viral jokes that everyone shares, and to which the masses contribute over the web, are fantastic. Jokes that go for the laugh at the expense of others, especially ones based on immutable characteristics, still have a wretched place in contemporary society. If only it weren’t so.
Hitler did nothing wrong
Dan, Please explain. Like me, some of us may not have seen “Tay AI.” Was that an account that was hacked by malevolent persons, who then posted vile expressions? And “jokes based on immutable (perpetual? ageless?) characteristics?” Please explain and give an example of such a joke, but using good taste. I don’t get it.

I hit the “snooze” button three times this morning. It’s a fitting metaphor for my mental state as midterms continue to disturb my peace this week. But I am far from alone in experiencing a constant state of mental exhaustion that so many of my fellow Trojans find themselves in.
So when I attend The Sleep Revolution College Tour, which comes to USC in a couple weeks, it’ll be groggy-eyed and accompanied with a yawn. Based on Arianna Huffington’s new book about the importance of sleep, the renewed interest in the role of a good night’s rest to mental health could not come at a more critical time during the semester.
Following the University’s health promotion initiatives —  through appointing wellness advocates or offering free swag at the Engemann Health Center — USC should use The Sleep Revolution tour as an opportunity to engage more critically with the question of whether the role of sleep is missing in conversations about wellness on campus. The University should also demonstrate its commitment to this issue by implementing a new student initiative pioneered at UC Berkeley earlier this year: napping pods.
Formally called Relaxation Enhancing Study and Tranquility zones, napping pods look a bit like egg incubators that a fifth-grader might introduce at a science fair — except they’re seven feet across and made for grown adults. The Associated Students of the University of California aren’t the first ones to use the chairs, which have formed the fabric of worker lifestyles in companies like Google, Zappos and Cisco to optimize productivity.
Granted, at UC Berkeley, REST zones cost a steep $104,000 for 40 napping pods. It’s a fair question to wonder whether these kinds of funds would be better allocated to addressing mental health problems or other pressing wellness issues on campus. Napping pods are, admittedly, a band-aid solution to the bigger problems of stress culture and mental health. But sleep is still an essential part of the conversation on overall wellness, and the establishment of napping pods on campus could be the first step to creating a culture more conducive to healthier sleep patterns.
Student involvement at the University, and at universities across the country, is at an all-time high, which means that more than ever, students are spending long hours in clubs, organizations, sports teams, internships and jobs — many of which occur at night. I, for one, often don’t leave the Daily Trojan newsroom until 9 p.m. on weeknights, after which I might begin my homework and assignments for classes.
An unfortunate consequence of the go-getting spirit that has led to students take on multiple identities — not only student, but also research assistant, intern, volunteer and young change-maker — is that college students today are doing much, much more than students of the past. The commitments that creep regularly into the night hours lead inevitably to a fundamental change in the way that college students function on campus. So the traditional model of sleep — eight hours every night — may not be realistic in a climate that is making our days longer than ever.
Empirical evidence supports the claim that naps are uniquely beneficial to college students. Matthew P. Walker, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at UC Berkeley, found that young adults who napped for 90 minutes after lunch improved their ability to learn. Not only could napping pods work to improve memory and cognition, but they could also work to radically change the way we view our lifestyles on campus and the importance of addressing our own physical and mental demands.
When I leave for class in the morning, I am utterly useless without an array of chargers for my laptop, phone and other electronics. Periodically throughout the day, I seek to plug in when I can to make sure these essentials are constantly recharged and ready for full performance. I’ve made this practice regular after days of returning home with a dead phone.
Now, I wonder, what would it be like if we charged our own batteries as often as we did those of our iPhones?

The future of the storied Los Angeles Lakers franchise stands in jeopardy — more than it ever has during my lifetime. Tensions  are high in the Lakers locker room upon the public release of tapings taken by  Lakers rookie D’Angelo Russell of a controversial conversation with teammate Nick Young.
In an effort to assert their disapproval of Russell’s actions, Russell’s teammates have elected to isolate themselves from the No. 2 overall pick of last year’s NBA Draft, sources close to the organization have revealed. In doing so, the Lakers are acting like present day Mean Girls — embodying a rebellious, teenage-girl-like “you can’t sit with us” mentality toward a guy that was brought in and expected to lead this struggling franchise back to its historical winning ways.
There’s no doubt that what Russell did was childish, wrong and seriously violated unwritten locker room rules. His behavior was treacherous, dishonest and untrustworthy — perhaps the antithesis of the traits necessary for  the longevity of a successful NBA career. His teammates, both present and future, could opt to never trust him again — snitches get stitches right? The fact that he’s still just a 20-year-old kid doesn’t justify anything that he knowingly or unknowingly did. His young age and on-the-court prowess does, however, provide a reason to forgive him in the interim and move on from this rather unfortunate predicament because whether his teammates like it or not, he is the future of the Lakers franchise.
For the sake of the team’s future, it’s imperative that we all forgive Russell and here’s why: Exactly two weeks from today, Kobe Bryant will play his last game in a Lakers uniform. For 20 years, he has, for the most part, been the face of the franchise. The dilemma the Lakers front office is faced with is  who will be that next figurehead for the organization.
When the Lakers used their lottery pick to select Russell in the draft, it’s plausible to assume that they thought he would take the reigns of leading the franchise in the post-Kobe era. Asking a youthful player to fill the shoes of a living legend is already a tall order to fill. It’s an almost impossible task actually, but while Russell continues to mature as a player and person (or not), he has a future with this team, and I certainly hope that this episode of “acting out” doesn’t result in the Lakers making a rash decision and disposing of him prematurely.
Masked behind the curtains of Kobe’s farewell tour, Russell has endured quite a bumpy ride in just his rookie season. He has been involved in trade rumors, benched, removed from the starting lineup, subjected to a large amount of criticism, dealt with injuries, connected to an alleged sexual harassment and now this. That’s a lot to throw at any NBA player, rookie or veteran, and while he could have handled it better at times, he still deserves credit for maintaining his poise amid this circus.
Russell still has a long way to go and obviously needs to grow up much sooner than later if he is going to be in any position to lead. It’s vital that he does because if the Lakers are going to want to build a team around him, they are going to have to attract free agents and draftees to come to Los Angeles to play alongside him. Therefore, it’s on Russell to rebuild his character and do whatever it takes so that players around the league entrust in him as a potential teammate, on and off the court.
Many critics say that Russell is the least of the Lakers’ problems, but I actually think that this situation serves as a reminder of their actual problem — a lack of identity as the franchise prepares to voyage into uncharted waters without a star player and distinguished leader.
Can you think of the last time, excluding injuries, when the Lakers didn’t have at least one superstar on its roster? You have to go back to the mid-’90s when the team was being led in scoring by the honorable Cedric Ceballos for a pair of seasons that resulted in early playoff exits. The franchise would probably kill just to get back into the playoffs in the next couple of seasons, but the way the league works today, I just don’t see that happening unless the Lakers have a clearly defined superstar. Whether that requires sticking with Russell, drafting a player like Ben Simmons (if he’s available) or going out in free agency and nabbing one of the Russell Westbrooks or DeMar DeRozans of the league, the franchise needs to get its priorities straight, and do it quickly.
The Lakers suffered their worst loss in franchise history the other night in a 48-point pounding at the hands of the Utah Jazz. It has become evident that the team’s disfunction internally is just as bad, if not worse, as the team’s play on the court this season. It pains me to say this, but this is a franchise on life support. Hopefully, this quandary stemming from Russell sheds some light on what should be of utmost priority — bringing the Lakers franchise back to life.
