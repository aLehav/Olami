Approximately 50 female USC students passionate about engineering, coding, design and architecture gathered at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism for the University’s first all-women makeathon this weekend.
SparkSC and the Annenberg Innovation Lab collaborated to host the event, “Break to Make,” in an effort to cultivate the talents of women in engineering at USC. The weekend consisted of brainstorming, building, talks from industry professionals, workshops and competitions.
At the makeathon, students brainstormed and built a project based on a given challenge over a 24-hour period. Toward the end, they pitched their ideas to industry professionals and other participants.
Event committee lead Mimi Tran Zambetti, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, initially helped create this event because of her experiences prior to attending USC. In high school, Zambetti attended an all-girls school and competed on the robotics team, which fostered her interest in maker culture and the creation of tangible objects through technology. Zambetti said she hoped to continue her passion in making when she moved to college.
“Coming here to USC, to a very male-dominated entrepreneur space, it was really important for me to figure out a way to break ground for women to connect in personal settings and more maker- and hardware-orientated stuff,” Zambetti said. “This is a space where women can come in to learn new skills like 3-D printing and to work with each other on a project, all within two days.”
At this makeathon, students had the opportunity to attend hands-on workshops with 3-D design and 3-D printing tools. They also were able to use a tool called Arduino, a microcontroller used to develop projects such as smart houses, Zambetti said. Students also used five printers from MakerBot and UltiMaker to practice prototyping and creating a tangible object within a short amount of time.
The event included guest speakers like Sheila Tejada, a USC professor of computer science.
“She’s really passionate about women in making and getting younger girls in high school involved in making small projects and being introduced into the field early on,” Zambetti said. “It’s really gratifying to me that people give up time that they’d spend studying for exams or hanging out with friends to come for a really big time commitment to essentially build a project.”

To kick off the building component, students were given a project brief in four different categories. One category focused on solving problems in the community in regards to basic human needs. While the education category encouraged students to brainstorm how to make the classroom experience more engaging, the third category, communications, was created in partnership with the Annenberg Innovation Lab to explore the future of media and technological advancements. The final category was an open design challenge for participants interested in making industrial designs beyond the other three categories.
Final projects included everything from programmed bugs that could locate natural disaster survivors to a food pantry sensor.
“Our team created a project that is meant to be put in a pantry,” said Maegan Chew, a freshman majoring in computer engineering and computer science. “It senses when the pantry is out of food items and then updates a web page afterwards. We created this project because we wanted to make something simple and helpful with the available technology that we had.”
Once the teams were done brainstorming and building, the projects were then pitched to three judges: Kate McAndrew from Bolt, Noramay Cadena from Make in LA and Tracy Van Houten from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The projects were scored based on aesthetics, functionality, efficiency and clarity in addressing the challenge.
“From the event, I learned to value others’ ideas,” said Rabia Ghulam-Ali, a freshman majoring in computer science. “I also understood that collaboration is essential if one wants to be successful in engineering. I personally enjoyed the 3-D printing workshop because I got to use Fusion360, which is a CAD program that allows you to create solid objects.”
Zambetti hopes that the women who participated in the makeathon got a deeper understanding of the challenges of the making process. Through this experience, she also hopes that the women feel more encouraged to get involved in the STEM community to help cultivate brighter futures for other aspiring female engineers.

The USC School of Pharmacy launched a new bachelor’s of science degree in pharmacology and drug development starting this semester.
The major primarily focuses on clinical pharmacology and will teach students about the basic receptor targets in the human body, how pharmaceutical drugs act on those targets and how one should think about a patient.
The major was developed by Daryl Davies, a professor at the School of Pharmacy, and will make USC one of only five universities nationwide to offer an undergraduate program in pharmacology.
Davies says that although many students are thoroughly prepared in the fields of biology, chemistry and biochemistry, they do not understand how to utilize all of these sciences when considering a patient.
“We didn’t have a solid major that trained students how drugs worked in the body, why we need prescription drugs, why a particular dose works well in one person, but not well in another, why we have side effects and why is it that thousands of people die every year from drug-drug interactions and improperly prescribed drugs,” Davies said.
The pharmacology degree intends to arm its students with the necessary skills for a future in their desired field.
“The new major is designed to prepare USC undergraduates for advanced clinical training in health-related fields including pharmacy, medicine and dentistry,” said Michele Keller, the director of communications for the School of Pharmacy, in an e-mail to the Daily Trojan. “It will also lead to new opportunities for students who are considering careers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries.”
Some undergraduates students have already taken the opportunity to switch into the new major. Annie Xie, a sophomore who recently switched into the pharmacology program from biology, believes that the program is suitable for students with a wide variety of aspirations.
“I think USC students might be interested to know that the pharmacology and drug development major is not exclusive to pre-pharmacy students,” Xie said. “I think that all future clinicians — doctors, nurses, dentists and pharmacists — could benefit from the classes offered in this major.”
After graduation, Xie hopes to pursue a doctorate in pharmacy at USC, and she believes her major will thoroughly prepare her for the next step in her career.
The new program also offers a number of new courses designed specifically for non-science majors, such as “Pharmacology and Sociology of Drug Abuse” and “21st Century Medical Issues and the Law.”

The USC Institute for Armenian Studies hosted its third annual Innovate Armenia event last weekend with an array of authentic music and festivities to celebrate Armenian culture. Through presentations, talks and performances, the festival provided patrons and those of Armenian descent a chance to learn about STEM research and education in Armenia.
Over the past three years, Innovate Armenia has held the festival to examine the intersection of arts, culture and technology through various speakers and artists. Last year’s festival drew 3,000 attendees, and 20,000 more watched online.
The Institute was established in 2005 and is composed of three full-time staff members and one full-time researcher. Associate director Silva Sevlian said this event brings together Armenian leaders to discuss pertinent topics.
“What we like to do is showcase leaders in whatever field we are highlighting that year and this year, it’s STEM,” Sevlian said. “It’s not about showing, ‘Here is one successful Armenian,’ it is about broadening what cultural identity means. It’s about introducing people and introducing professionals and stimulating dialogue outside the norm.”
Each aspect of the event related to one or more of the three focal points of the Institute for Armenian Studies. These points include post-Armenian genocide research, diaspora studies and the Republic of Armenia.
Innovate Armenia featured three centers of attention this year. At the Alumni Park, there were several featured musicians, Armenian delicacies and wine for visitors to enjoy. Inside Bovard Auditorium, there were TED Talk-style presentations and panels discussing contemporary and past Armenian topics. Inside Doheny Library, there was an installation called “Undeliverable” which featured rare postcards from Armenia as well as contemporary images by Brazilian photographer Norair Chahinian.
Chahinian shared how his photography taught him more about the Armenian diaspora, in which many Armenians fled Turkey as a  result of the Armenian Genocide of 1915.
“I learned many stories from that place, but also I found life, I found hope,” Chahinian said. “I met many, many people that taught me a lot about how they survived over these past 100 years dealing with a very hard condition.”
Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
“Undeliverable” additionally featured 160 original printed sepia tones on Ottoman postcards collected over 32 years by Istanbul-based businessman Orlando Carlo Calumeno. Director of the Institute Salpi Ghazarian said this became an opportunity to put stories of those lost in context and convey the depth of the political violence which resulted in genocide.
STEM innovations were presented through the collaboration of the Fab Lab to lead a maker’s station which featured technological innovation from students in the Viterbi School of Engineering as well as Glendale Community College. The attractions included a 3-D printing station that recreated a famous Armenian temple and keychains with laser cutters. These innovations were shown to promote the technology and innovation in Armenia, according to Eric Hovanessian, a sophomore in Viterbi.
A new attraction this year was the inclusion of a continuous chess game between 10 guests from the public versus Armenian grandmaster Tatev Abrahamyan  and international master Andranik Matikozyan as a team. Chess is a large part of the Armenian education system and is a common pastime in the Armenian culture.
“Chess is a big part of Armenian culture,” Abrahamyan said. “Chess is one of the most popular games there, and I think chess is the field where we exceed in the most. The Armenian Olympic team has won the gold medal three times.”
The one-day festival featured events to inspire involvement and interest in reimagining identity, language, history and technology for the entire diaspora to encourage discussion about how heritage can meet innovation.

Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
It took three quarters and four interceptions for the Trojans to find their mojo in Berkeley.
The spark came from the defense in the fourth quarter, backed up with the Bears’ heels on their own goal line. Senior defensive tackle Josh Fatu hit Cal quarterback Ross Bowers from behind, and the ball popped into the air. Senior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu — who spent all day terrorizing the young quarterback — snatched the ball in mid-air, crashing to the ground at the two-yard line.
It was the easiest job that the offense had all day: scrap for two yards in four snaps. They clinched it on the second down with a hand-off to freshman running back Stephen Carr, who powered through two defenders to dive into the end zone and stretch the USC lead over Cal to 23-13.
The 10-point lead was the first chance that the Trojans had to breathe in almost four full quarters of play. A well-matched pair of defenses had brought the game to a grinding halt by the third quarter, but the offense burst to life in the final quarter to clinch the first road victory of the season.
The final score read as expected for a matchup between the No. 5 Trojans and the unranked Bears: 30-20. But USC had to struggle through it, grinding for three quarters of stagnant offense before exploding in the fourth quarter to take the victory.
“We hope that when you get into these games, you can look up and can be a good second-half team,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Credit to our kids. They came in at halftime, took a deep breath, made some changes and really elevated the whole level of play in the second half.”
The defense remained the catalyst for the Trojans as the offense sputtered, but weaknesses at every position were on full display in the first half. Injuries plagued the team on both sides of the ball, with junior linebacker Porter Gustin missing from the defense and playmakers junior running back Ronald Jones II and redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. sidelined for the offense.
Highlights came few and far between for the team in the first half of play, as the offense struggled to find any sort of rhythm against a hard-hitting Cal defensive line. In another slow start, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold tossed a goal-line interception and took a sack while completing 16-of-24 passes in the first half. He went on to finish the game with 38 completions and 223 yards, but his longest completion was only 19 yards.
“It was such a relentless pursuit to me by the [defensive] line and the linebackers who rushed,” Darnold said. “I felt a little bit of pressure but I think it’s mostly our fault on not connecting on some of those deep balls and some of those opportunities. We need to take advantage of those when they come our way.”
The absence of Jones left an obvious gap as well, as the weight of the USC ground attack fell on Carr’s shoulders. The team picked up only 69 rushing yards on the half, and the result was an off-balance half of play for the offense.
The offense shined for a single drive in the second quarter, the only offensive series to result in a USC touchdown. Junior tight end Tyler Petite stepped into the hole left by Mitchell, snagging two 12-yard passes, while Carr moved the chains twice with runs up the gut. A final 16-yard pass to Petite gave him a curling route to the right corner of the end zone, where he dove to knock down a pylon and tied the game up 10-10.
Yet again, the lack of offense forced the USC defense to stand strong. The defensive line dampened the Cal rushing attack, holding the Bears to 82 yards on the ground, while the secondary forced Bowers to throw for under 50 percent with 13 incompletions. The Bears also benefited from a single full-field march to the end zone, but at the half the defense kept the game level.
“We get more comfortable as the game goes on,” junior linebacker Cam Smith said. “We have a little saying to stay up here, keep the intensity up here and just finish the game off right.”
Both teams entered the second half with something to prove, but a nondescript third quarter left the score tied 13-13. The Trojans found themselves staring down a familiar situation: starting the fourth quarter with no wiggle room between themselves and a loss to an unranked team.
Darnold continued to struggle, rolling out of his pocket time and time again to launch arcing tosses to junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett that couldn’t find their target. He ended the game with only one interception, but struggled to hit receivers and was nearly picked off two other times. Four games into the season, interceptions have become one of the biggest holes in Darnold’s game.
“It’s 100 percent my fault,” Darnold said. “I’m not getting the ball out far enough on deep routes. Whether it’s balls being tipped, not seeing the d-linemen … I’m going to continue to just play, that’s all I can do but, obviously, be more consistent for my team and continue to take what the defense gives me.”
Freshman walk-on kicker Chase McGrath proved his worth again by hammering home a 46-yard field goal, giving the Trojans a 16-13 lead. Despite the thin lead, the Trojans looked peaked.
But Nwosu’s interception breathed new life into both sides of the ball, and the team took its 23-13 lead in stride. Redshirt sophomore Ykili Ross snatched another interception, running it back for 43 yards, and Burnett punched in another touchdown to give the team a 17-point lead.
The Bears kept fighting, but another interception — this time from sophomore cornerback Jack Jones — sent the Cal fans flooding for the exits. The Trojans’ secondary would go on to notch four interceptions on the day as the defense fully denied the Bears a comeback.

After a four-set win against Oregon State on Sunday, the women’s volleyball team (10-3, 2-0 Pac-12) jumped one spot in the rankings, from No. 21 to No. 20 (25-21, 24-26, 25-18, 27-25).
USC also moved to 53-9 all-time and 9-1 in the last 10 matches against the Beavers.
During the intermission between sets, the Women of Troy saw themselves tied at a set apiece against the Beavers. While in the locker room, head coach Mick Haley emphasized keeping a consistent, high level of energy on the court.
“We can’t give up, we have to stay with the energy,” Haley said during the break. “I really just think we can work harder.”
They did just that. After dropping the second set, they closed up sets three and four to secure the match victory.
The USC offense was led by sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, as she put up 20 kills while swinging a .239 hitting percentage. Senior opposite Brittany Abercrombie put up 18 kills, tying her career-high set Wednesday at UCLA, and a .326 hitting percentage. Sunday’s performance, combined with her team-high performance at UCLA, earned Abercrombie the title of Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. It was her first weekly conference honor.
Sophomore opposite hitter Daley Krage matched her career high of 12 kills and put up a career-high 15 points.
Defensively, junior libero Victoria Garrick put up 25 digs. Against UCLA, Garrick put up her first career double-double with 18 digs and 10 assists. Garrick was honored as the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week, her first conference weekly honor. She also equaled her career-high of three service aces against the Beavers.
Despite being out-blocked by the Beavers 13 to 4, the Women of Troy still managed to dominate the net offensively, with 73 kills to OSU’s 54.
“[Blocking has] been their forte,” Haley said. “They get their hands over the net quick and hard.”
With OSU’s big block up front, the USC hitters adjusted mid-set to keep their offensive effective. For Krage, her success came from depending on the players around her.
“Communication with the back row to call out shots for me,” Krage said. “Since there’s a big block out there, they call me what’s open and it’s a lot easier to swing that way.”
Despite not starting the match, junior outside hitter Alyse Ford put up eight kills with a .357 hitting percentage against the tough Beavers’ block.
“We rotated our players around,” Haley said. “Having Ford gave them a boost. It’s nice to have a fireman on the team, somebody that can come in and put out the fire.”
Haley leans on the depth on his team. The ability to rotate allows his players to stay fresh and keep the opponents on their toes. Haley worked Ford in the match against UCLA in a similar way. Ford was the spark plug USC needed in the fourth and fifth sets to take the match against the Bruins.
With two wins to open conference play, Haley is going to give his team some rest, but they’ll get right back to work on the court to prepare for Washington State and No. 6 Washington when they come to town this weekend.
USC plays WSU on Saturday at 1 p.m. and the Huskies on Sunday at 1 p.m. at the Galen Center.

After winning 13 games straight, the men’s water polo team suffered its first loss of the season on Sunday in the championship game of the Mountain Pacific Invitational against No. 4 UCLA.
The Trojans faced top teams during the long weekend: They played a one-off match against No. 13 UC San Diego on Thursday, then moved on to tournament matches against San Jose State on Friday, No. 10 UC Irvine and No. 3 Stanford on Saturday and finally UCLA on Sunday.
Both matches went down to the wire on Saturday, but USC rallied from behind against UCI and Stanford to earn a spot in the championship.
“I thought we had a great tournament and we proved ourselves in a lot of clutch moments,” senior utility James Walters said. “I thought we played really well. Then, in this last game [against UCLA], things obviously didn’t work out the way we wanted it to, but I am still confident going into the next ones. I think we are going to learn a lot.”
The Trojans battled Stanford Saturday evening in a semi-final match that came down to the final seconds. The Cardinal arrived at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center with something to prove after losing to USC 8-6 just 16 days earlier — and it showed in their play. The Trojans scored in the first 13 seconds and essentially held the lead for the entirety of the game when the two sides first met on Sept. 8, but the opposite was true on Sunday. USC raced out to an early lead, but the advantage quickly slipped away from the Trojans until the end.
“There was more energy in the pool — I could feel it,” Walters said. “Everyone was more fired up about it because it was the second time we were playing, and [the Cardinal] didn’t want to go down a second time, obviously. They were a lot tougher.”
USC entered the final quarter trailing by one. A power-play goal from sophomore driver Thomas Dunstan knotted things up early in the fourth, and another man-up score — this time from senior 2-meter Lachlan Edwards — pushed the Trojans ahead 9-8 with five minutes left to play. But the Cardinal equalized quickly, even after senior driver Blake Edwards netted his second goal of the game to stake USC a short-lived 10-9 advantage. Finally, senior driver Matteo Morelli played hero for the Trojans, scoring the go-ahead goal with 28 seconds left in an 11-10 victory.
Following their tough match Saturday evening, the Trojans then had to make the quick transition and play UCLA the next morning. The Bruins had already defeated top-ranked Cal the previous day and were gunning to take down No. 2 USC next. The Trojans pulled ahead early, but UCLA seized the momentum in the second half. After a back-and-forth third quarter, the Bruins grabbed a one-goal lead with 13 seconds left in the period and didn’t relinquish the lead from there. Despite their lack of rest before Sunday’s contest, the Trojans refused to blame fatigue for the loss.
“UCLA had two tough games before this, so we’re all in the same boat,” Walters said. “They ended up winning it this time.”
The Trojans will face the Bruins again later in the fall, but that matchup won’t come until November, in the last game of the regular season. Until then, the team is determined to apply lessons from this weekend over the rest of the campaign.
“I think we are going to have to take a step back, watch video and sleep on it a bit and look at it,” Walters said. “We let a lot of shots in that we shouldn’t have, and we weren’t quick enough in a lot of our defensive situations. We are going to get better at that next time.”
Ultimately, the Trojans were disappointed with their loss, but they still came away with a second-place finish in a tournament of top teams in front of strong fan support.
“We love playing at home,” Walters said. “At the end of the day, this is the sport we love to play, and we get to play it in front of all our friends and family. Having an opportunity to play at home is one of the best moments for an athlete.”

Anytime you can come by making a dollar bill, that’s a good thing. Regardless of the physical condition of the buck, you’re happy to put it in your wallet — even if it’s a bit crinkled or torn around the edges. A $100 bill fresh off the printing press is just as effective as one that’s been balled into a wad for weeks.
That’s the way that USC fans should be feeling about the Trojans’ start to the 2017 regular season. Despite being undefeated a third of the way through the season, USC just hasn’t racked up as many style points in its victories as the Trojan faithful would have hoped or expected.
With a gritty road victory over unranked Cal (3-1) this past weekend, No. 5 USC improved to 4-0 overall this season. Four consecutive wins to open the campaign is USC’s best start to a regular season since 2010. The win Saturday also extended USC’s current winning streak to 13 games (dating back to last season); the team hasn’t lost a game in over a calendar year.
However, there still seems to be plenty of uneasiness among fans and followers of this USC program — despite its being undefeated and ranked in the top five nationally.
The reason for concern is rational. Three of USC’s four wins on the season have required the Trojans to make substantial pushes in the second half to come away with victories. In the case of USC’s Week 3 win over Texas, it took two overtime periods for the Trojans to come away victorious against Tom Herman’s unranked Texas team. USC’s 18-point victory over Western Michigan was deceiving, as the Trojans had to rely on a 28-point fourth quarter after being tied with the Broncos through three quarters of the game.
That’s the cause for concern. That’s what has the Trojan loyalists squirming in their chairs with still eight games remaining this season — and no bye weeks separating them. USC’s failure to pile on style points in contests against “lesser” opponents has struck a subtle fear in its followers.
This imminent anxiety will spike this week as the Trojans prepare to do battle with No. 16 Washington State (4-0, 1-0 in Pac-12) in Pullman, Wash., on Friday night.
Prior to the season, if any bystander would have looked at USC’s first four regular season match-ups, they would have likely assessed the Trojans’ Week 2 matchup with Stanford as the toughest early-season test.
However, the Trojans put their most dominant performance on display against the Cardinal in unexpected fashion. USC has instead engaged in its toughest slugfests against unranked opponents — Western Michigan, Texas and, most recently, Cal.
But is this such a bad thing? Is there something positive to be said about USC learning to be comfortable in the uncomfortable games against scrappy teams? It’s certainly nothing to be proud of if you are playing down to the level of lesser opponents, which is the assessment many have made of USC thus far. But there has to be some silver lining about this team constantly finding itself in hard-fought contests.
There’s definitely merit when looking at a team that can run through its regular season and rout every opponent on its way to a College Football Playoff berth. But shouldn’t there also be a great deal of applause for the program that can navigate successfully through 12 contests, and come away with heroics on multiple occasions?
The latter scenario is favorable because that team has passed through a wringer of adversity en route to the postseason. No matter what success you reap in the regular season, adversity will always strike you hard in the postseason. It’s a law. It’s a matter of how a team responds to said adversity that determines its ultimate success.
Legendary heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson once said, “Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth.” Through the early stages of 2017, USC has certainly caught several uppercuts on the chin from unsuspecting challengers. But on each occasion, the Trojans have found ways to masterfully counter-punch and maintain their perfect record.
So, as the fifth-ranked Trojans take the trip up to Pullman this Friday to square off with Washington State, many are anxious about what could be awaiting USC. This contest with the Cougars has been heralded “USC’s most dangerous game of the season,” and it very well may be. However, the Trojans’ resiliency this season gives me assurance that they can enter enemy territory and come away with a win.
Let’s just say Washington State senior quarterback Luke Falk drives the Cougars down the field for a score on the opening drive of the game — and USC finds itself trailing 7-0 early on the road.
No big deal. Just another punch on the chin.
This Trojan team has lived for the counter-punch so far this season. The team’s national championship aspirations do not depend on weekly style points in victories. Their fulfillment completely depends on going 1-0 against every opponent, every week, pretty or not.

Eighteen city blocks and fluorescent signage were all it took to make Life Is Beautiful one of the best music festivals of the year. Held from Sept. 22 to 24 in downtown Las Vegas, the fifth annual event boasted a colorful lineup of artists, performers, food, art and speakers with over 120,000 attendees and hundreds of attractions.
Throughout the weekend, performers and stages were scattered throughout the venue. Electronic music lovers gathered mainly at the newly renamed Fremont Stage, which hosted DJs like Whethan, Troyboi, TOKiMONSTA and Tchami. In addition, the Forest House and Kalliope art cars were all-day party spots with electrifying DJ sets by Dr. Fresch, Collective Zoo and even a surprise post-performance appearance from Ekali.
Art was present at every corner of the festival, with open spaces filled with vibrant murals, fluorescent lights and avant-garde structures. Zappos’ Art Motel provided an escape in between performances at the Downtown and Huntridge stages. With 23 rooms featuring the works of a variety of artists, attendees were able to experience art through interactive exhibits, like playing an instrument through hand movements in the air, and watching others dance in stop motion among reality-distorting visuals.
Beyond music and art, Life Is Beautiful featured a variety of presenters, speakers and lounges that appealed to all audiences. Scientist Bill Nye opened the festival with a talk on Friday afternoon. “Fight Song” singer Rachel Platten and vlogger Bethany Mota were also present for speeches throughout the weekend. In iconic Las Vegas fashion, Cirque du Soleil took the stage on Sunday afternoon for an explosive performance from MGM Grand’s KÀ to Mandalay Bay’s Michael Jackson ONE.

The High Times Cannabis Village encouraged patrons aged 21 and older to experience cannabis education right on the festival grounds. Bringing together exhibits, seminars, art and dispensaries, the lounge was open throughout the weekend.
Beyond this, this year’s Life Is Beautiful boasted a major lineup of food vendors. Southern California-based favorites Afters Ice Cream and Milkbox were present at the festival, while food trucks like Cousin’s Maine Lobster were dispersed throughout the 18-block site. However, one of the best aspects of the event was its ability to incorporate local businesses into the festivities. Several bookstores, bars and restaurants within the site were open for patrons to visit and enjoy.
Ultimately, the performers made the weekend worthwhile. On Friday, Lorde, Chance the Rapper, 2 Chainz and Two Door Cinema Club delivered explosive performances at the Downtown Stage. Despite sustaining lower body injuries prior to the festival, 2 Chainz wheeled himself out to the delight of fans. Meanwhile, fan favorites like RAC and Blink 182 took over the Ambassador and Fremont stages.
Despite having smaller crowds, Saturday had its fair share of captivating performances. Up-and-coming artist Sigrid made her appearance at the Huntridge Stage early in the day. DJs Whethan and Ekali seamlessly transitioned their sets at the Fremont Stage, while Capital Cities had fans waving their clothes in the air during a final remix rendition of its hit “Safe and Sound.” Before Muse, Wiz Khalifa and Kaskade closed off the night, Goldroom and Local Natives captivated crowds.

And on Sunday, arguably the most crowded day of the weekend, fans flocked to see Zhu, Gorillaz, The xx, MGMT and Tchami perform. However, female artist Dua Lipa, DJ Mura Masa and sister pop-trio HAIM also brought in major crowds beyond the Downtown and Fremont stages.
Despite having an unbalanced Saturday schedule, Life Is Beautiful was a one-of-a-kind celebration that offered attendees an unparalleled music experience, supplemented by art, food and ideas. Integrating local businesses and using already landscaped locations, the event is a prime example of how major music events can still benefit the community. This year’s festival shows just how beautiful life can be when people come together for music and culture.

Eric Nally’s screaming voice is bound to catch people off guard when they begin listening to Macklemore’s new solo album Gemini, which was released last Friday.
Nally’s chorus for the first song “Ain’t Gonna Die Tonight” invokes strong power, which he and the background choir infuse in the listener. The first verse only continues this intensity and invigoration, as Macklemore sings it with immense passion and intensity. The song displays a slower beat with hard-hitting vocals and signals a promising direction for Macklemore’s music.
The next song, “Glorious,” takes this a step further with Skylar Grey’s chorus, in which she makes a strong stance about starting again. Macklemore uses this song as a means of telling the world that he is ready to make his claim to the music industry, as his previous album This Unruly Mess I’ve Made was followed by a few underwhelming singles. He proves his point by including a pulse-pounding piano beat that is reminiscent of his big hit, “Can’t Hold Us.” This song is so upbeat that it might have been better if it was placed later in the album because there is a clear dive in its quality after this song.
A trailer for Gemini shows Macklemore talking with the rest of his crew, as he detailed his plans for this album.
“I want to come here every day with the blank slate, with the intention of just making something,” he said. “It could be dope. It could be garbage. We do a song a day. Next day, we start something completely different.”
While Gemini’s worst songs aren’t necessarily garbage, one can’t help but feel as if Macklemore failed to live up to his full potential. Perhaps if he had spent a little more time developing the songs’ caliber, the album quality could have been much higher. With that in mind, the album does at least improve following the drop in quality that occurred in This Unruly Mess I Made.
This rings true, as the two best songs are immediately followed by the worst, “Marmalade.” While the piano staccatos are a nice touch to the song, this is a return to the corny lyrics and an even worse chorus. Lil Yachty’s verse is fine, but the song is almost embarrassing to listen to.

Songs afterwards, such as “Levitate” and “Firebreather,” are not as bad, but they also fail to be memorable. Still, there are other songs that at least have one notable factor. “Willy Wonka” is another return to Macklemore rapping about whatever random topic comes to mind. However, he has also been known to rap lyrics incredibly fast, and this song has an impressive verse in which he displays this talent while being backed by a strange, yet suitable beat. “How to Play the Flute” has instrumentals that sound similar to that of Future’s “Mask Off” while a large part of “Zara” sounds like an upbeat version of Chance the Rapper’s “Juke Jam.”
Conversely, there are songs that could be great but are squandered by minor moments that can deter the listener from the song. Most of “Ten Million” is good. However, the autotuned chorus is irritating to listen to, and its frequency slowly removes any genuine likeability one would have when first listening to it. “Over It” has a nice chorus and set of verses. Unfortunately, most of these vocals are strangely mixed with violin instrumentals. It feels as if Macklemore was trying to fuse pop and classical music together, which resulted in a mismatched sound for the song.
While he can add unconventional ideas to rap songs with ease, Macklemore is also known for his quiet songs. “Intentions” and “Church” do not have much to offer apart from simple instrumentals and choruses by featured artists. “Miracle” provides a soothing guitar melody and interesting usage of outside audio. The best of the quiet songs, “Good Old Days,” begins with passionate vocals from Ke$ha that are complemented by a piano accompaniment. The song overall reaches the likes of “Same Love” because Macklemore succeeds in finding the right kind of energy needed for a quiet song while having genuine lyrics.
This valued characteristic is evident in the final song, “Excavate.” The hard-hitting beat and lyrics that look into Macklemore’s thoughts about the past and future are seamlessly integrated with his raw delivery. This is balanced out with Saint Claire’s soothing chorus about finding peace. The song ends with an outro that brings the album to a flowing close, both lyrically and musically.
Gemini’s tracklist order found an energized start that was never met again, despite the attempted gradual increase after the initial disappointment that was “Marmalade.” While it has its moments, such as the balance between a random idea and an unexpectedly appropriate beat in “Corner Store,” most of Gemini is just a passive listen with an inconsistent energy level. Overall, it proves that Macklemore has glimmers of originality, and the first two songs alone are some the best work he’s ever done. However, we may have to wait until he releases another album before we truly witness the “return of the Mack.”

Instead of going to class last Friday, I stayed in bed for the entire morning and afternoon. In my defense, it was the first day of fall and there was a nip in the air. With the temperature at around 65 degrees, how could I be expected to go outside in such frigid conditions? The need to stay in bed was just too tempting.
With hot coffee in one hand, I flipped between the pages of Peter Stoneley’s A Queer History of Ballet while listening to Massenet’s Werther. Met Opera on Demand just uploaded a brand new 2017 recording, with tenor Vittorio Grigolo in the title role and mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard as Charlotte. Werther is tragic — a love story that never really gives audiences closure. Based on the novel by Goethe, the story follows the poet Werther, who is in love with Charlotte. However, she is already betrothed to Albert, and has agreed to marry him to fulfil the wish of her deceased mother. It’s clear Charlotte does love Werther, but she also loves Albert. Eventually she marries Albert, though later we find she regrets her decision. What do you do when you’re in love with someone, but already committed to someone else? Do we always just want what we can’t have?
Though there are a great deal of stories in which happy endings do take place, how realistic is it in the long run? We’re all just waiting for the next best thing, right? In Rossini’s Il Barbiere Di Siviglia, Rosina and Count Almaviva spend the entire opera trying to get married, even though Rosina is already (begrudgingly) engaged to the decrepit Bartolo. In the end, Rosina and Almaviva are eventually married, and all ends well. However, in its “sequel,” Mozart’s Le Nozze Di Figaro, Almaviva spends the entire show trying to bang the housemaid. The passion and love between Rosina and Almaviva is gone, and Rosina spends her time moping and lamenting about the former days of her now-loveless marriage. Obviously, Almaviva is one of the many operatic examples of an antiquated f-ckboy, but shouldn’t Rosina have seen it coming? She did marry Almaviva only days after they met.
At least Charlotte waited months to once-and-for-all kick Werther to the curb. And even though Charlotte did love him, she probably knew there’d be no point in entertaining Werther’s imaginations. In a few years, he’d probably leave her anyway for the next piece of ass that trots by. I would suggest Charlotte do the same, but in a patriarchal society that rebuffs promiscuous women, her opportunities thereafter would be incredibly limited. It’s really just a lose-lose situation for all.
Werther and Le Nozze di Figaro aren’t the only operas that share these themes. Opera is full of tales of wanting what you can’t have. In Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin, Tatyana falls madly in love with Eugene Onegin, though he explains to her that he isn’t one for marriage (a.k.a. another f-ckboy). However, in the opera’s third act (set five years after their initial courting), Tatyana has moved on to marry Prince Gremin. It is only when Onegin sees Tatyana happily married to another that he decides he is actually in love with her. He confesses his feelings to Tatyana, though she coldly rejects him.
Yes, she still loves him, but he had his chance to marry her, and she won’t leave her current husband. Onegin is left heartbroken, though it’s hard to feel sorry for him. He had his chance and he blew it. And though these stories are fictional, many of them draw inspiration from raw, human emotion. I can’t help but relate the similarities to real life as well. Even if we don’t act on our urges and impulses, we’re always yearning for what we don’t and can’t have.
I find myself avoiding stories that have happy endings. Why entertain a fantasy when you can be realistic? In the aforementioned examples I provided, we have three protagonists who all couldn’t be more different. Werther loved too much, and he ends up killing himself at the end of his story. Onegin loved too little, and he’s left in the cold, alone. And Almaviva literally loved everybody, yet he still ends the show on his knees begging for forgiveness. What both share is heartbreak from the ones they were unable to court. But where is their remorse? It’s really only when they can’t get what they want that they see the folly of their actions.
In the end, nothing works out for these three men. Werther kills himself. Onegin in shunned. Almaviva is humiliated. The only lesson to be learned is that you’re always going to yearn for what you can’t have, so find a way to control your impulses so you don’t end up like these fools.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Joining the buzz around current cinematic releases, director Darren Aronofsky’s mother!  has certainly risen to the top of the filmgoing conscience. Starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, the film is a disturbing tale of a young woman who lives alone with her older poet husband in the countryside, and the horrifying turn of events that takes place after strange visitors come into their home. It’s a story meant to shock and entertain, but also one intended to educate through an extensive metaphor about religion and science.
When one thinks about why directors make movies, it is natural to wonder how many viewers the film was intended for and how many were supposed to like it. With regard to mother!, however, it is very fair to assume that Aronofsky did not consider those questions at all: Unmistakably, mother! could not have been made to be liked. With its ominous, insidious sound design and stomach-lurching cinematography, the film is at once visually and narratively uncomfortable. Not created for the faint of heart, its message is accessible only to those willing to subjugate themselves to learning it.
mother!  is deeply polarizing, throwing audiences and critics to different ends of the criticism spectrum. But interestingly, someone who has managed to crawl out of the barrage unscathed is Aronofsky himself. Recently, The New York Times published an in-depth piece in which Lawrence, Bardem and Aronofsky discussed the movie — the relentless filming process and the action behind the most difficult and alarming artistic choices. The New York Times fairly points out that Aronofsky has a tendency to direct twisted and somber films like Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan. What the piece also seems to imply is that sometimes Aronofsky will make movies that land and sometimes he will make movies that go over people’s heads, but at the end of the day, he is still a wizard of the disturbing and the dark, whose vision will stand up even if viewers did not like it.
The way society talks about artists has always been gendered — the word “masterpiece,” after all, has a very male connotation. Far fewer female directors and far fewer women artists in general have risen to the status of icons, have had their names become adjectives in the cultural lexicon, or have been remembered for anything other than being the first or one of the few in their fields. The last female director to have received a significant spotlight was Patty Jenkins, who helmed Wonder Woman, released earlier this summer. But where she earned, albeit rightfully, far-reaching praise for this accomplishment as a woman, the attention focused wholeheartedly on her gender rather than the immense and unique skill she brought to the job. A tremendous artist in her own right, Jenkins previously directed Monster — a film that earned Charlize Theron a Best Actress Academy Award in 2004 and that showcased one of the most stunning performances in cinematic history. Curiously, Jenkins herself was not even nominated for the directing Academy Award that year, although Sofia Coppola was nominated for Lost in Translation. (To this date, four women have received the nomination. Only one — Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker — took home the statue.)
Whereas Aronofsky gets to be labeled an auteur, Jenkins and her fellow female filmmakers are simply women who direct. In The New Yorker, film critic Richard Brody dissects his distaste for listening to directors explain their own movies in response to mother!. And yes, he is right. It is the imperative for the director to properly convey his or her message — not the responsibility of the viewer to correctly read into it. But still, this reality begs the question: If that doesn’t work, will the director be forgiven? And what will determine if he or she is? As Alissa Wilkinson pointed out in Vox, in a world where Wonder Woman failed to be a hit, the financial disaster would be blamed on the female lead and her female director. Compare that immense pressure to the rose-colored bubble Aronofsky seems to float so peacefully in past criticism: Any disconnect between mother! and its audience is something that just happens when a strong artist has a strong vision. More importantly, a weak box office performance would not be his failure — it is simply a result of artistic miscommunication.
To be fair, mother! and Wonder Woman are two very different movies. The former could never be mistaken for trying to appeal to a mass audience, while the other is indubitably a summer commercial blockbuster meant to rake in millions. But in the grand scheme of things, they are two pieces of art made in the same medium. They utilize the same tools and the same players. Each has its own director, entitled to their own respective visions. So why honor and acknowledge the artistry of one and the gender of the other? The world is undeniably better off for hiring and celebrating more women filmmakers. But when that step has concluded, it is the duty of those who support a more inclusive Hollywood to look beyond the physical markers of progress and into the boundless potential of marginalized artists, for that is where progress is truly made.

Growing up a big fan of the Golden State Warriors, I always watched with envy when championship teams visited the White House. You see, the Warriors were not close to good enough to win a title when I was a kid, so them getting to meet the president was more of a pipe dream than a realistic goal. Still, it was something I wanted to see. If you would have told 10-year-old me that in the year 2017, the Warriors would win the title but not visit the White House, I would’ve been very confused. How did my awful franchise become good enough to win a championship? What happened with the president that they didn’t get an invite when literally every single championship-winning team in my lifetime has?
The answer to both questions is Stephen Curry. He is a transcendent basketball player who turned the Warriors from a laughingstock to a dynasty. And he was also the subject of President Donald Trump’s tweet at 5:45 a.m. last Saturday, in which Trump mentioned Curry by name and “withdrew” the invitation — though none had officially been issued — to visit the White House because Curry was “hesitating.”
It was an abrupt end to a budding controversy and the elephant in the room that had surrounded the Warriors since they clinched the trophy in June, considering several key members had made their distaste for the president clear. In February, Curry responded to a comment by Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank that Trump was an “asset” by claiming he was, but only if you removed the “-et” from the word. In May, head coach Steve Kerr called Trump a “blowhard” that is “ill-suited” for the presidency.
Nonetheless, the Warriors were considering a visit, making plans to discuss it as a team and even having conversations with senior White House officials to see if they could work something out. But with 140 characters, Trump did the equivalent of dumping a prom date who never agreed to go with him in the first place, hoping to seem strong.
Instead, his decision sparked fierce social media backlash and widespread condemnation across the sports world. Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James called Trump a “bum,” adding that “going to the White House was a great honor until [Trump] showed up.” Retired NBA legend Kobe Bryant lashed out in a tweet saying Trump’s attacks wouldn’t “make America great.” Chicago Bulls forward Robin Lopez had the line of the night, claiming that in a few months, Trump “probably won’t be able to visit the White House either.”
In all honesty — and as Kerr said in a story in Sports Illustrated on Sunday — the Warriors probably weren’t going to visit the White House anyway. And there were those pundits who called out the team for injecting politics into sports, for disrespecting the office of the president of the United States. Championship-winning teams have visited the White House since President Ronald Reagan made it a regular occurrence. The presidential visit has become ingrained in sports tradition. It’s supposedly a day when everyone sets aside their political differences to hang out in the White House and meet the president, which, on the surface, doesn’t seem like a very controversial thing to do.
But to do so under this president seems different. No president in recent memory has created as much tension and division as Trump. This is a president who kicked off his campaign by calling Mexicans “rapists,” endorsed police brutality and had to be coerced into a half-hearted condemnation of neo-Nazis and white supremacists while at the same time claiming that some white nationalists, were, in fact, “very fine people.”
On Friday, while speaking at a rally in Huntsville, Ala., Trump railed against NFL players protesting police brutality and racial inequality by taking a knee during the national anthem before games, calling on the NFL to fire any  “son of a b—-” who did so. Trump continued his assault, sending out eight tweets about the league over the weekend and three more early on Monday that ranged from castigating NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell — who put out a strong statement pushing back against Trump — to advocating that fans stop watching games until players who kneeled were “fired or suspended.”
Under the shadow of a president who clearly does not understand the concept of peaceful protest, has enacted policies and has made divisive statements that have a clear adverse effect on minorities — who are omnipresent in both the NBA and NFL — it is totally acceptable to not want to visit the White House. And for those who want athletes to “stick to sports,” perhaps the president should “stick to politics” first.
If anything, Trump’s decision to wade into sports is only going to unite players against him. More than 200 NFL players didn’t stand for the anthem during Sunday’s games in direct defiance of Trump. The Tennessee Titans, Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks  — and in the WNBA, the Los Angeles Sparks — remained in the locker room before Game 1 of the Finals on Sunday, leaving the court before the anthem. On Saturday, about 40 miles from where Colin Kaepernick started the entire movement a year ago, the Oakland Athletics’ catcher Bruce Maxwell became the first MLB player in the 148-year history of baseball to take a knee during the national anthem — and baseball, mind you, is “America’s pastime.”
While the Warriors won’t be visiting the White House this year, I’ve never been prouder of my team — even prouder than when they won two championships in three seasons  — for using their platforms as famous athletes to take a stand for what they believe is right, and prioritizing morality over tradition.

Does anyone really care what a jock thinks about anything outside of their sport?  Kneel, stand, go to the White House or don’t. Who cares what those micro-cephalics do beyond a sports rap?
