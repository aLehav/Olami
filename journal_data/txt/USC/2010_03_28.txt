After 10 months of work, the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity was successfully rechartered Saturday and is once again a full-fledged, active chapter in USC’s Greek community.

PiKapp first came to USC in 1976 but was disbanded in 2006 when its charter was revoked by its national council. The fraternity recolonized in February 2009 and has been working since then to earn its charter back and once again become a part of The Row.
“We’ve worked very, very hard to recharter our fraternity over the last year,” said Theo De Berito, a senior majoring in gerontology and the founding president of PiKapp at USC. “It’s been a long and tedious process, but it’s also been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. We’re all glad we did it.”
Being chartered grants PiKapp full chapter status in the national organization, whereas previously it was considered only a colony. It is an official recognition that the fraternity chapter is now ready to govern itself, as opposed to being supervised by its national office.
“We’re more independent in that we can create our own policies and bylaws now,” said current President Alex Fadil. “For instance, we can now decide what percentage of active votes and the minimum GPA required to initiate a new member as opposed to having it decided for us by national. As long as we uphold the standards of the national fraternity, we can now alter the details as we please. Before rechartering, we went strictly by national standards.”
The charter process included organizing philanthropic events, such as Sorority Football, establishing a budget, holding officer elections and recruiting new members; PiKapp currently has around 65 active members, twice what it had at the beginning of the rechartering.
In the process, PiKapp also raised money for its chosen philanthropy, Push America. Push America, which was founded by PiKapp, serves the disabled through a combination of disability education and the construction of accessibility tools such as wheelchair ramps. According to Tyler Quinn, the leadership consultant for the national Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity, PiKapp is the only fraternity to own and operate its own philanthropy.
The actual chartering ceremony began Thursday and culminated Saturday with a banquet at the Los Angeles Athletic Club to celebrate the fraternity’s success.
“This is an exciting time for any Greek community to add a fraternity to its ranks,” Quinn said. “It ensures change and makes us stronger as a whole. Pi Kappa Phi will really add something of value in terms of challenging Greek stereotypes on campus.”
PiKapp hopes to use its new chartered status to enhance the image of fraternity members as leadership figures, he said.
“The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Development welcomes Pi Kappa Phi back as a chartered fraternity; we’re very much looking forward to what this organization will bring to USC,” said Beth Saul, assistant dean for Student Affairs and director for the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development.
Beginning next semester, the USC chapter of PiKapp will reclaim its former house, which is currently occupied by the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. ZBT will take over the current Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house.

The USC Financial Aid Office, which is preparing to send incoming freshmen their financial aid awards this week, is hoping that improvements to its process will help eliminate the confusion and concern that was prevalent last year.
According to Noemi Garcia Tagorda, senior assistant dean of financial aid, the Financial Aid Office reviewed approximately 322,000 documents this year for approximately 22,000 financial aid applications. The office allocates a budget of more than $180 million dollars to more than 20,000 new and continuing students who require financial assistance.
Under the direction of Katharine Harrington, dean of admission and financial aid, the Financial Aid Office has made several changes this year to speed up the process and help boost efficiency.
At the beginning of this year, a number of students ran into problems with financial aid. Some students were notified that their documents had never been received, even though they had been sent. Other students had questions about their aid packages and had difficulty finding answers.
To eliminate problems and confusion, Harrington initiated a dramatic redesign of the financial aid workflow.
“In the past, it was mostly paper that was mailed in or faxed,” Garcia Tagorda said. “But we have this new feature called document upload. It gets information to where it needs to be so much more quickly than before.”
The Financial Aid Office also redistributed staff to help process data more efficiently, even enlisting the aid of the admissions processing staff.
“Things that used to take a couple of days or more are now only taking a day or two,” Garcia Tagorda said.
The office also hired four new people in charge of analyzing each family’s need and two new staff members to help assemble the aid packages.
“Because we have new staff, we’re really moving through it,” Garcia Tagorda said.
She added that the Financial Aid Office works overtime during these weeks to ensure awards are prepared in a timely manner. USC students are hopeful that the process will indeed be more efficient this year.
Monica Yap, a freshman majoring in business administration, recalled a particular incident last year that made her wonder if forms sometimes slip through the cracks.
“I remember last year, for USC, we had to fax something, and it was about to be due in a couple days. And I remember USC sent this e-mail: ‘We’re sorry, there was a really high volume of faxes, and we just wanted to confirm that we got yours.’ And I thought, I guess that could definitely happen, where they just don’t get it, because so many people are turning theirs in,” she said.
According to Garcia Tagorda, financial aid requires three core documents to determine awards for the majority of applications: the prior year’s tax forms, the College Scholarship Service Profile and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
“Once we’re sure we have those three core documents, we use the documents to determine a family’s expected contribution,” she said.
She did note that additional documentation might be required.
“Sometimes everything we need is in [the core] documents, sometimes we need a little more,” she said.
Some students said the number of documents needed for financial aid can create a lot of work.
“It’s just a pain applying for USC financial aid,” said Chris Rayon, a freshman majoring in philosophy. “They tell you they need the FAFSA and the CSS Profile, but after you send that in they ask for W2s and all sorts of other stuff after the deadline they give you.”
With USC’s annual cost of nearly $54,000, financial aid awards are critical to many.
Garcia Tagorda said the university does its best to assist students.
“We want to help families out; we want to help your situation as necessary,” she said. “In the end here, this is a partnership between parents, students and the university. I hope students know that every single person [in the Financial Aid Office] really cares that a student is dealt with in a fair, equitable and timely manner.”

A well-traveled No. 5 USC men’s tennis team displayed a determined effort with two decisive victories to open up the Pac-10 season.
Award winner · After winning his second Pac-10 Player of the Week honor, sophomore Daniel Nguyen won three more games this weekend. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
On Saturday, the Trojans (16-2, 2-0) defeated No. 21 Washington 6-1, and on Friday, they swept No. 67 Oregon 7-0.
The team felt prepared and expressed a strong will to win in its first two conference matches
“Our team was ready to play these last two days, and nothing was going to stop us from winning,” senior Robert Farah said. “The guys showed commitment, and that’s important.”
Against the Huskies (15-3, 0-2), USC won all three doubles matchups. USC coach Peter Smith was impressed with the doubles play, especially at the No. 2 position  featuring sophomore Daniel Nguyen and freshman JT Sundling  and at the No. 3 position  with juniors Jaak Poldma and Peter Lucassen.
Both duos won easily with scores of 8-4 and 8-2, respectively.
At the No. 1 doubles position, Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson got the break they needed late in the pro set to win a hard-fought match 8-6.
During the singles portion, the Trojans got off to fast starts with the entire lineup winning their respective first sets.
No. 89 Nguyen started things off with his eighth-straight singles win, No. 72 Poldma followed suit with a straight set triumph, and No. 11 Farah clinched the match winning in a second set tiebreak over Kyle McMorrow.
No. 1 Johnson defeated No. 54 Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and senior Jason McNaughton won his match in straight sets to give the Trojans the 6-0 match lead. No. 84 Lucassen finished the day off with the match’s only blemish losing in a third-set super tie-break.
On the previous day, the Trojans played the Ducks (11-6, 0-2) without Farah, who was nursing a back injury.
Farah mentioned that he sat out the Oregon match because his back was a little tight, but he was able to play in the Washington match and  said he does not expect his back to affect his play in future matches.
Farah’s absence necessitated a doubles lineup shuffle with Nguyen and McNaughton playing at No. 1, Johnson and Sundling playing at No. 2, and Poldma and Lucassen playing in their customary No. 3 position.
USC won convincingly at the      No. 2 and No. 3 positions to secure the match’s first point.
Sundling, Nguyen, Lucassen and Johnson all won their singles matches in straight sets, and Poldma and McNaughton pulled through in tightly contested third-set super tie-breaks to finish off the sweep of the Ducks.
The team’s recent stretch of road matches — eight of the previous 10 matches have been played on the road ­— has prepared the Trojans for this first weekend of conference play.
“Our tough schedule has set us up to play well in the Pac-10 openers,” Smith said.
The successful opening to the conference season has given USC confidence, but there is still room for improvement, especially with the top conference teams still to come.
So far, the Trojans have responded to the adversity they faced this season, and that winning attitude has pervaded the lineup
“Winning solves most problems,” Smith said. “Winning gives everyone confidence, so that is the key. Winning is contagious.”

In case Zipcar, Zimride, USC shuttles and Metro Transportation Authority buses weren’t enough options, students looking to get away from campus can now pick up a car from campus through a new partnership with Enterprise Rent-A-Car. 
The program, which launched earlier this month, offers students the chance to rent cars at discounted rates and allows them to pay a daily rate rather than an hourly rate. The program also offers a wide range of vehicles for students to choose from.
The partnership began when Enterprise’s car-sharing program, WeCar, was brought to the attention of USC Transportation. Since USC already had Zipcar as a car-sharing option, discussions with Enterprise turned to longer-term car rentals, an unoccupied niche at USC.
Enterprise and USC agreed to a two-year contract. USC receives no compensation for advertising and promoting Enterprise.
Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation, said the program is not meant to compete directly with Zipcar, since the two programs differ in flexibility and duration of rentals.
“There are situations where an hourly rate is not a cost-effective option: for example, students wanting to plan a weekend trip,” Mazza said. “Additionally, we don’t have vans or trucks as our Zipcar vehicles. Students may need a minivan or a 15-passenger van for a group trip, or a truck for moving equipment or personal items.”
Zipcar charges an annual $35 membership fee for students and rents by the hour or day. The cheapest hourly rate is $8, while the cheapest daily rental is $66. The cost includes insurance, fuel and 180 driving miles.
Enterprise does not have such a membership fee and rents by the day, week or month. Its fleet contains a broader range of vehicles, including trucks, SUVs, minivans and luxury cars. The cheapest daily rental, which includes unlimited mileage but not fuel, is $44.99. Those 18-20 years of age can rent but must show proof of insurance, according to Mazza.
Mazza said he thinks the program will be successful because of its accessibility, ease of rental and the USC discount.
“Enterprise has a minimum age requirement of 18 with no additional fees, which differs from most car rental companies,” he said. “Enterprise [only] requires you have a valid driver’s license in any state or an international permit, which we think is a huge benefit for students. Our USC branch also offers special rates for faculty, staff and students when they present their USCard.”
Enterprise officials are also optimistic about the partnership.
“We’ve had a great response — rentals were particularly up during spring break,” said Lisa Martini, a public relations representative for Enterprise. “The cost-efficiency, the convenience, as well as the recognized relationship we have with so many of the students, faculty and alumni at USC make the on-campus rental branch a great opportunity — and partnership — for everyone.”
Some students, however, do not see Enterprise as an appealing method of transportation.
Kunal Bhan, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, said he does not believe Enterprise’s longer rental options are suited to college students.
“It’s cool with more places to rent cars from, but I think people will probably still stick with Zipcar, since it’s cheaper [for short periods of time] and easier,” Bhan said.
Other students said that it is good for students to have another option.
“Before it was only Zipcar. I guess this is good because you get to choose,” said Kent Kobayashi, a freshman majoring in mathematics. “Though personally, I wouldn’t use it because my friends [would] have cars.”
Some said they think the Enterprise program will be useful for longer trips.
“I think it’s a good idea because it’s a lot more affordable for people to rent at a flat [daily] rate,” said Kelsi Halverson, a freshman majoring in theatre (design). “If you need a car all day, it would cost more to rent hour by hour.”
Students can rent a car from the Enterprise campus office, which is located in Parking Structure X near the Transportation office. The office is open from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to noon on Saturdays.

Jason Cruz, the project coordinator for the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, received an award last week for his contributions to USC and his leadership in the construction of the student Campus Center, which is scheduled to open in Fall 2010.
Cruz was given the Richard D. Blackburn New Professional Award, which has been presented by the Association of College Unions International since 1995 and is named in honor of one of the organization’s past presidents. It is granted annually to “young professionals” who have demonstrated commitment to their college union and have been in the field of student affairs for anywhere from two to five years.
Cruz was nominated by Patrick Bailey, the associate dean and executive director of student life and involvement. Bailey hired Cruz to work for Student Affairs after he graduated from USC in 2006.
Cruz has been involved with the construction of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center from the start, overseeing construction management, fundraising, and creating programs and events.
Bailey described Cruz’s commitment to USC as “amazing” and “inspirational,” in a profile on the USC Student Affairs Website.
In addition to his work with the Campus Center, Cruz has served on the panel of judges for the Order of the Torch and is an assistant coach to the USC Spirit Leaders.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team extended its winning streak to 12 games this Saturday with a 9-4 victory over the visiting No. 14 San Diego State Aztecs.
With another dominating effort, the Women of Troy (14-1, 3-0) avoided an upset like those so far in the NCAA basketball tournament. Though ranked, the Aztecs (16-11, 0-5) were winless in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Conference play. Accordingly, San Diego State posed little threat to a USC team that appears to just be tuning up for an inevitable clash with No. 2 Stanford at season’s end.
USC’s last line of defense, senior goalie Tumua Anae was stingy between the pipes, recording 12 saves.
Led by their usual diverse scoring attack, six different players scored at least once, with senior driver Kally Lucas, junior two-meter Sarah Van Norman and junior driver Joelle Bekhazi each scoring twice. The number of scoring options on the team continues to impress, as it prevents opposing defenses from keying in on specific players.
With 2:12 left in the third quarter, the Women of Troy had amassed an insurmountable 9-1 lead.
The final score wound up being a more palatable 9-4 defeat for the Aztecs after San Diego State scored two goals with three minutes left in the game — a point at which USC coach Jovan Vavic had substituted in most of his reserves.
Generally, Vavic refuses to allow his team to rest on its laurels, but, after this game, even he was uncertain where the team could improve defensively — even marginally. Having stressed defensive intensity all season long, Vavic has seen his players execute and lead the NCAA in goals against average.
“We played good defense again and controlled the tempo,” Vavic said. “Our five-on-six play was excellent. We didn’t give up any goals.”
Offensively, Vavic thought the production left a little to be desired. Although nine goals is plenty Vavic knows that his players cannot continue failing to capitalize on great scoring opportunities.
Although missed shots might not have mattered against the Aztecs, against other tougher opponents it could prove to be a problem.
“Sometimes we look awesome, like against Long Beach State,” Vavic said. “However, two days later we play San Diego State and look average. We have to improve on our shooting.”
Such level-headed leadership keeps this team grounded.
For successful teams, often the biggest obstacle is not allowing overconfidence to disrupt their focus. The Women of Troy have struck the perfect balance.
With some easier opponents on the docket, the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team will not be fully challenged for at least another week. They will, however, be wise to use this time to perfect their shot-making abilities.
The Women of Troy next hit the pool in a non-conference home game against Brown this Thursday at 5 p.m.

A limited contingent of athletes shone for the USC track and field team at the Stanford Invitational in Palo Alto, Calif., on Friday and Saturday.
Sprint · Sophomore Blake Shaw ran a 3:44.66 in the 1500-meter. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The highlight for USC was junior Zsofia Erdelyi, who broke her own school record in the women’s 10,000-meter run on Friday night with a time of 33:18.75, finishing fourth among collegiate runners at a meet known for its high level of competition in the distance events.
“She turned a lot of heads out there,” said USC distance coach Tom Walsh. “She’s really worked hard this year after a sub par cross country season and came out with some fire this year.”
Erdelyi ran identical 5,000-meter splits, a tremendous feat in a race as long and grueling as the 10,000-meter.
“It was a very smart race for Zsofia,” Walsh said. “Stanford is the benchmark for distance running, and for her to run such an even, intelligent race was great to see.”
Sophomore Blake Shaw also ran a tremendous race for the USC men, finishing third among college runners with a new personal best of 3:45.66 in the 1500-meter run. The race continued Shaw’s surge up the USC all-time ranks in the event, moving him to sixth a week after jumping from ninth to seventh. Shaw also ran a solid 800-meter race, finishing 11th overall with a time of 1:51.51.
Despite the meet’s heavy concentration on distance, the USC women’s sprinters had a solid showing. Senior sprinter Judith Onyepunuka advanced to the finals in the women’s 100-meter dash with a new season-best 11.86, and finished fourth overall in the finals with an 11.89.
Senior Shalina Clarke only missed a first place finish in the women’s 100-meter hurdles with a time of 13.39, just .01 seconds behind winner Kimyon Broom of California. Also, senior Elizabeth Olear finished fourth for the Trojans in the women’s 400-meter dash with a time of 55.11.
Onyepunuka, Clarke, Olear and senior Myra Hasson teamed up for the women’s 4×100-meter race and placed third overall with a blistering 45.51.
Next up for USC are the Texas Relays, a meet that earlier this week USC coach Ron Allice said would feature “the most intense competition [the Trojans] have seen so far this season.”

Did you watch that Kansas State-Xavier game?
I sure hope you did.
Because what a game it was, complete with just about every attribute and storyline you’d want out of a sporting event as a neutral observer.
First, you’ve got a great pre-game scenario — a small underdog in Xavier, a big opportunity to reach the Sweet 16 and a tense history between the two teams with a K-State win earlier this year but a Xavier upset victory two years prior.
Next, you’ve got probably the best announcing duo in all of college sports, the incredibly timely Gus Johnson and the solidly humorous Len Elmore — a factor that truly cannot be underestimated.
Then there’s the whole K-State “Fear the Beard” thing, guard Jacob Pullen’s cult phenomenon that exaggerates his weak beard to no end, and a Xavier team that was supposed to be in a rebuilding stage after losing head coach Sean Miller to Arizona.
And finally you had the actual game.
Thursday night in Salt Lake City, Kansas State opened on a 19-4 run only to see Xavier outscore the Wildcats 28-12 to take a 32-31 lead at halftime. K-State then took a small lead in the second half, maintaining it until the final minute, when the madness really started.
Pullen hit a big 3-pointer, Xavier’s Jason Love responded with a layup and Pullen made two more free throws to give the Wildcats a three-point lead, 72-69, with 10 seconds left.
The Musketeers’ guard Terrell Holloway was then fouled while attempting a three. He proceeded to make all three shots from the charity stripe to send the game into overtime.
Keep in mind that Pullen told The Associated Press afterward that he had clinched the game with his free throws: “I’m thinking, ‘That’s game. That’s the nail in the coffin,’”
No way. K-State opened up another three-point lead in the final minute of the first overtime, 87-84, only for Xavier’s guard Jordan Crawford to knock down perhaps the most ridiculous shot of the tournament — a 35-foot 3 — with seven seconds left to extend the game another five minutes.
Double overtime was equally close. Xavier actually led, 93-91, with a little more than a minute to go. But Pullen took over from there, hitting consecutive threes and adding two more free throws to power his team to the victory, 101-96.
“That’s March basketball at its finest right there,” Kansas State coach Frank Martin told The Associated Press after the four-hour, wildly entertaining contest. “That’s two teams refusing to give in and refusing for their seasons to end. I expected it to be a hard-fought game. “I didn’t expect it to be like this.”
USC fans might remember Martin, Pullen and Kansas State as the team that upset the sixth-seeded Trojans in the 2008 tourney — remember the power forward Michael Beasley versus forward Keith Wilkinson matchup?
Ha. Well, while the Wildcats went on to lose to upstart Butler in the first game of the Elite Eight on Saturday, nothing can detract from that fated contest with Xavier.
Nothing. It’ll be part of March Madness for the next 10 or 20 years, without a doubt, just like guard Tyus Edney’s famed full-court drive and power forward Christian Laettner’s infamous catch-and-shoot.
And isn’t that why we watch sports to begin with?
The vast majority of sporting events we watch are in no way remarkable. In fact, I’d argue that many of them are remarkably boring.
But you keep watching — you trudge on — just because you know that one time or another you’re going to have the opportunity to witness pure athletic history in its rarest form.
Kansas State-Xavier was certainly of that form, and I’m glad to have had the chance to witness it.
Nevermind all the other not-so-good games we had to watch to get to that one — it’s all worth it.
Oh, it’s definitely worth it.

Stanford second baseman Colin Walsh’s single to right field in the bottom of the seventh inning drove in two runs to break a 1-1 tie, and the No. 19 Stanford Cardinal protected their lead to beat the Trojans, 3-1, Sunday in the rubber game of a three-game set at Sunken Diamond in Palo Alto, Calif.
Hiccup · After six strong innings to start, sophomore pitcher Andrew Triggs, pictured here against Oregon, ran into trouble in the seventh inning on Sunday after giving up a hit and a walk and gave up three earned runs. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Starter Brett Mooneyham (1-3) picked up his first win of the season for the Cardinal (12-6, 2-1). He pitched six innings and allowed only one run on three hits and seven strikeouts. Cardinal Alez Pracher picked up his third save, pitching three innings of scoreless relief. Walsh finished the day 3-4 with one run scored and two RBI.
Sophomore pitcher Andrew Triggs (1-3) took the loss for USC (12-12, 1-2), giving up three runs on five hits with three strikeouts. Sophomore Chad Smith pitched  one and two-thirds innings of scoreless relief for the Trojans to end the game. The Trojans compiled only five hits in the game, two of them coming off the bat of sophomore outfielder fielder Matt Foat.
Both teams jumped on the board early in the contest. In the top of the first inning, USC sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa hit a solo home run off Mooneyham, but the Trojans left the bases loaded when junior third baseman Matt Hart grounded into a double play to end the frame.
The Cardinal responded quickly with a run of their own. In the bottom of the first, Walsh led off the inning with a base hit to centerfield and scored later on freshman Stephen Piscotty’s sacrifice fly to right field.
Both teams were held scoreless after the first until Walsh broke through with the game-winning single for Stanford in the seventh.
USC dropped the second game of the series Saturday when Stanford infielder Zach Jones singled to right with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Cardinal a 5-4 walk-off victory against the Trojans and even the Pac-10 series.
Sophomore Brian Busick (2-0) earned the win for Stanford after pitching two innings of no-hit relief. For the Trojans, sophomore reliever Brandon Garcia (1-2) was charged with the loss after giving up one run in one and two-thirds innings. Sophomore Ben Mount started the game for USC and gave up four runs in seven innings.
Although the Trojans lost the final two games of the series, they opened up Pac-10 play on a positive note Friday, defeating Stanford 13-8. Sophomore infielder Taylor Wrenn scored four times and drove in the go-ahead runs for the Trojans in the sixth inning. Wrenn and Oropesa tallied three hits each on the game, and sophomore Alex Sherrod added a three-run homer.
Shuhei Fujiya (3-1) earned the series-opening win for the Trojans, allowing only one run on four hits in three innings, while Garcia and junior reliever Chris Mezger combined to throw two shutout innings.
USC now travels to Loyola Marymount Tuesday to take on the Lions at 3 p.m. before continuing conference play in a weekend series against Oregon State at Dedeaux Field.

With the NFL draft less than a month away, this time of year is generally filled with prognosticators and analysts spending every waking second debating over which teams will make the plethora of available college standouts and pro prospects their next employees.
Mock drafts and draft boards are not an exact science, but the latest rumor regarding former USC tight end Anthony McCoy’s potential destination come draft day may be more truth than fiction.
When the senior tight end takes to the field on Wednesday for his pro day, reports say one team in particular will be taking note — the New England Patriots. The connection makes perfect sense for the organization, which in recent weeks has fallen on hard times at the position, losing Ben Watson to free agency and cutting veteran Chris Baker loose.
In two years as USC’s starting tight end, McCoy caught just 46 passes, but the Fresno native’s 6-foot-5, 250-pound frame surely makes him an intriguing option for NFL teams.  And despite the fact that his collegiate career was at times marred because of injuries and academic ineligibility, McCoy’s performance in January’s Senior Bowl caught the eyes of several professional scouts.
“He is not a burner and not as athletic or fast as Jermaine Gresham [of Oklahoma], but he is a far tougher blocker with good hand placement who moves his feet well laterally,” wrote Steve Muench of ESPN’s Scout Inc. “He plays with an edge and is not afraid of contact. As a pass catcher, he tracks the ball well and is fast enough to make teams pay when they bite on play-action.”
Although New England signed 32-year-old tight end Alge Crumpler to a two-year deal last week, pundits like ESPN’s Todd McShay believe that the Patriots will still need to fill a void at the position with their second round pick in the upcoming draft — a spot it seems they will more than likely still find McCoy waiting, due to what’s being called a “very shallow” class of tight ends.
Whether these rumors are just food for thought, or actually have some validity to them, only time will tell — but don’t be surprised if McCoy is catching passes from a future Hall of Famer in Tom Brady next season.

How do you spot a tourist in a city full of strangers? Look for the person with furrowed eyebrows stopped in the middle of the street, pouring over a tattered city map with all the major landmarks drawn as cartoon icons.
In most places around the world, these confused visitors would be looked upon with annoyance, even disdain. In Dublin, however, they are the injured birds chirping in despair, and the city’s residents are quick to take them home and nurture them until they are ready to fly again.
More than the actual city itself, I was impressed with the welcoming demeanor of Dubliners — even during St. Patrick’s Day weekend, a time sure to attract plenty of clueless tourists. From the moment I stepped out of the airport, I found that most people bent over backwards to help.
With a reputation of being a convivial and affable group — especially after a few pints of Guinness — the Irish rank at the top of Lonely Planet’s “World’s Friendliest Countries” list, and for good reason.
During my first encounter with my Irish hosts, I asked a bus driver which line to take to Grafton Street, where my hostel was located. I expected only a short reply but, instead, received an offer to be driven to my destination.
This simple gesture of kindness alleviated the anxieties I felt after a maddening Tube, bus and plane ride from London.
Unfortunately, when I was finally dropped off on Grafton Street, the hostel was nowhere in sight. I stood for a full minute trying to figure out whether the numbers on the buildings increased when I turned left or right, only to have my thoughts interrupted by two young men.
To be approached on the street at 11 p.m. on a Thursday night by two men might not bode well for a girl out and about in Los Angeles, but in Dublin the practice is almost as innocuous as it would have been if the conversation occurred during the day on a crowded street.
Apparently, “Where do you need to go?” and “Let me show you” are phrases employed on a daily basis.
The two boys chivalrously offered to walk me to my hostel, which turned out to be a lot farther down the street. When I inquired about their plans for the night, they suggested a nightclub they were headed to and drew a large “X” over where it was located on the map. After settling into my bunk, I decided to stop by.
Even at 1 a.m., Copper Face Jacks — a venue popular among the local 20-somethings — was still packed with people. One man, despite his slurred speech and wavering balance, launched into a whole history of his family’s involvement in Ireland’s struggle for independence. Another pulled me aside and taught me a few steps to the Irish jig.
It seems that the Irish are a proud bunch, more than happy to introduce their city and share their heritage with interested tourists. Throughout my trip, all it took was a confused look or a simple gesture for someone to stop what he was doing and point me in the right direction.
On a walking tour I took the following day, the guide — who was born and raised in Dublin — offered some insight into why this might be. She told stories of historical failure after failure, resulting in the development of a twisted sense of humor among the Irish.
Throughout its history, Ireland has been invaded by the Celts, the Vikings, and — most notably — the English, against whom they have fought long and hard for independence.
During Easter 1916, the Irish launched a rebellion against England. The rebels couldn’t rally enough fighters to storm Dublin Castle, however, and decided to postpone the battle. The next day, they changed their minds again and stormed the castle with a mighty force of 10 men and nine women.
Having met no opposition, they easily took over the seat of British power in Dublin. But, with victory within grasp, the rebels foolhardily retreated, thinking the lack of opposition to be a trap.
Although the 1916 rebellion ultimately failed, Ireland eventually won its independence in a 1921 truce with the British, which was met with controversy.
In response to a failed city initiative in 2004, pranksters placed a plaque on the city’s O’Connell Bridge commemorating the heroism of fictional Roman Catholic priest Father Pat Noise. When the Dublin City Council revealed the hoax and tried to remove it, the public left flowers and tributes beside the plaque in protest.
Perhaps it’s because of these failures that the Irish are able to meet any situation with a smile and a boisterous laugh. Or maybe their altruism simply stems from trying to save innocent bystanders from catching the un-luck of the Irish.
You are lucky you did not end up a crime statistic.  Los Angeles is not the only dangerous city out there.  Stay safe and use some common sense!

Technical malfunctions and cramped quarters didn’t stop the USC Chamber Ballet Company from putting on a stellar performance Thursday night.
En pointe · The program featured dances to songs by the Beatles and Sufjan Stevens. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
When the curtain was pronounced broken mere minutes before the first dancers were set to take the stage — leaving them with no practice floor hidden from the swelling audience in Bovard Auditorium — they did not panic, but simply took to the dressing rooms and stairwells instead.
“The whole event has been incredibly well run, especially since it’s student-directed,” said Jeanmarie Steele, a freshman majoring in civil engineering. “We were able to organize very well.”
The USC Chamber Ballet Company celebrated the culmination of a semester’s worth of effort with its fourth annual spring showcase, “Black and White,” which focused on the dancers’ interpretations of opposition.
While the company was part of a larger fall event in which it collaborated with other dance troupes, the spring production was a chance to spotlight its own choreography and dancers.
This year’s event featured 16 numbers orchestrated and mainly performed by the company’s 19 members. Special guests Jonathan Langley and members of another USC-based group, Alosus Company Dancers, danced in their own pieces, “Simple Dreams” and “Case Study: Women on the Edge,” respectively.
“The format here is very open. If you want to do a solo, you can go do a solo. If you want to just choreograph a piece and not dance in it, that’s fine too. Anyone in the company has the opportunity to dance and choreograph whatever they want,” said Diana Smith, a sophomore majoring in communication and co-director of USC Chamber Ballet.
For many members, that flexibility afforded a unique opportunity to experiment.
“I decided to choreograph ‘Brush on Silk’ for the showcase. I’d never done choreography before this. It was a lot of fun,” said Alison Hom, a freshman majoring in communication.
For this year’s show, the company members chose to incorporate many different styles of dance. Most performances were contemporary, though classical ballet and hip-hop styles shone through.
“When it comes down to it, most choreographers want to add a lot of contemporary [influences],” Hom said.
That wasn’t a problem with “Black and White.”
Interpretations of the theme ranged from Co-Director Kristen Scudder’s soothing “Blackbird” routine, to the captivating-yet-disturbing “Alzheimer’s Children,” choreographed by Smith, to “Werewolf” by Alexa Cohen and Nicole Jaffe which featured a spotlight moon and hair-raising howling.
The four guest dancers from the Alosus Dance Company gave a striking performance to Clint Mansell’s Summer Overture, in which they portrayed demented women suffering as prisoners of the mind.
Though the show’s theme was “Black and White,” the showcase was not bereft of color. Many choreographers interpreted the show’s namesake as a call for the abstraction of tension and contrast rather than a literal need for the title colors.
Natasha Moussouras’ “l’Harmonie” presented dancers in red and blue, and Langley — the only male dancer of the night — performed in a Peter Pan-esque get-up.
“We were really excited about the theme this year” said Scudder, a junior majoring in civil engineering. “In past years, it’s been pretty informal and didn’t really impact the performances, but this year we’ve done a good job sticking to it. We wanted the audience to come away with an impression of the tension we focused on.”
The company members were certainly up to the challenge. Since winter break they have practiced their basic skills each week, while tacking on additional time for every dance they performed in the spring showcase. For some, this meant up to six extra hours of practice a week.
“It’s been fun,” Smith said. “The girls are so sweet, and they all have this common passion for dancing and for ballet. There are no cliques or drama — we get along really well.”
Although I am generally pleased with Ms Medrano’s  review of “Black and White” I am confused about her comment of Jonathan Langley’s performance in a “Peter Panesque” costume. Did you not read the program? 
“Second Star from the Right” is out of the music from Peter Pan and that is who he was protraying. Did you not notice “Wendy” in the blue. The article makes it sound like Jonathon was dancing around in this weird green outfit for no real reason. And the number was a little strange. Jonathon is a very good dancer and a very strong partner. And the young lady he was partnering is a charter member of the company.
Other than this small descrepancy Ms Medrano captured the company and the evening very well.

Last time John Mayer stepped inside the cavernous Staples Center arena, he was dressed sharply in a black trouser-and-vest combo as he played a rendition of Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature” 20 feet from the King of Pop’s casket.
Battle studies · Because of the artist’s romantic history revolving around Los Angeles, John Mayer’s appearance was more a therapy session. - Candice Harbour | Daily Trojan 
It was a somber occasion then, and Mayer’s performance was subdued and perhaps a bit subpar for the singer who has been deemed the Eric Clapton of his generation. Yet the man also known for his obsessive, candid Tweets and shameless bravado did not open his mouth once through the nearly five-minute-long performance but let his fingers do the talking.
Mayer, however, did open his mouth six months later in a now-infamous Playboy tell-all interview that stoked many flames of Mayer’s past and sparked a number of fresh controversies. “Sexual napalm,” a reference to ex-girlfriend Jessica Simpson, has quickly become a catchphrase in contemporary jargon while Mayer’s nonchalant dropping of the N-word made a cannonball splash in the African-American community. And who can forget the high-profile relationship with actress Jennifer Aniston, a tabloid sensation and an eventual heartbreak that still lingers almost a year after the couple’s breakup.
It’s easy to see, then, why Mayer’s performance at the Staples Center on Thursday night — his sole Southern California stop on his global “Battle Studies” tour — was a bittersweet return to the city that prides itself on being his harshest critic. Home to entertainment blogger Perez Hilton (an irritating foe for most celebrities) and his ex-lovers, the night was shrouded in both heartache and resentment radiating from a much-too-recent jilted past.
And even though Mayer still played to his fans, dancing his guitar over to all corners of the stage so every concertgoer in the sold-out arena could catch a glimpse of the pop musician, it was apparent that Thursday’s show was completely self-indulgent — and rightfully so.
“I’ve had my heart filled to the brim here, I’ve had my heart broken here,” Mayer said early in the show, his first of many confessions to the audience. “But I still can’t stop coming back here.”
It’s the stuff from which blues is born, and what unfolded Thursday was a group therapy session with 20,000 fans, most of whom did not know what they were in for.
In a move that would please hard-nosed audiophiles over album-buying fans, Mayer let his smokey vocals play second to his deft guitar playing, a quality of his that is often brushed-over, processed and subdued on his records.
The vastness of the Staples Center was quickly filled by Mayer’s intricate riffs and powerful shredding, the wailing of his electric guitar doing most of the talking for the evening.
The first taste of Mayer’s guitar prowess came in the soul-inspired “Vultures,” which began with a lengthy yet fluid intro, featured a hypnotic interlude with fellow guitarist David Lyons and ended, unexpectedly, with beat-boxing.
The lusty “Slow Dancing in a Burning Room” was even more seductive than its recording on Continuum and was slowed to a languid yet emotionally charged pace that allowed Mayer to truly let go. His vocals revealed their first sign of honesty, forgoing their smooth refinement and instead cracked, strained and yelped as they searched octaves high and low and finally matched the blues sensibility of his instrumentation.
Another intimate moment came when Mayer brought out his acoustic guitar (thankfully) not for “Daughters” but for an untitled song dedicated to the loneliness of Los Angeles.
“L.A. breaking your heart. It sounds like a [Bob] Dylan song,” Mayer prefaced the track. “Raw but beautiful.”
It was obvious that influences ran deep throughout the night, as Mayer introduced “Battle Studies” with a verse and chorus off Dylan’s  “Just Like a Woman,” while “L.A. Song” suddenly flowed into Tom Petty’s “Free Falling.” After strumming through a rather anti-climatic “Half of My Heart,” Mayer seamlessly transitioned into Fleetwood Mac’s ’70s standard, “Dreams.” Unfortunately, these songs were lost on the teens and 20-somethings that comprised most of the sold-out crowd.
Similarly, Mayer’s resounding eight-minute-long cover of Bill Withers’ R&B classic “Ain’t No Sunshine” was the standout performance of the night as Mayer and company grooved as uninhibitedly as if they were hanging out in someone’s garage. But it was during this impressive musical exhibition that most of the audience seemed to tune out.
Much like the humility found in folk musician Leonard Cohen’s recent performances, Mayer took time out from being a commercial superstar to acknowledge his fellow musicians onstage. Apart from “Ain’t No Sunshine,” the highlight of the night was drummer Steve Jordan (a Grammy Award-winner who once toured with Clapton) and his exhilarating solo jam session that became a several minute-long intro in “Waiting on the World to Change.”
“Gravity,” which Mayer has said to be the most important song he’s ever written, was a powerful if predictable choice to end the show. But after the standard verses and choruses, Mayer again threw his crowd-pleasing vocals aside and concentrated fully on his guitar. Toward the song’s end, Mayer suddenly placed his instrument on the ground and began to pluck and trace the strings with his fingers, as if a little kid experimenting with an unfamiliar toy. Completely focused to the point of becoming cross-eyed, it seemed there, stomach flat on the floor and his fingers swiftly sliding from one end of the fret board to the other, that Mayer was truly happy.
And as he left the stage with his guitar slung over his back and a heavy weight removed from his chest, it was certain that after months of unfiltered interviews and blogging slander, a little less conversation was in order for John Mayer.

College tuition has just become less of a burden for all students and their families.
Sullivan Brown | Daily Trojan
President Barack Obama is expected to sign an education bill Tuesday that reforms the federal student loan programs, which will save taxpayers money, make student loans manageable and raise Pell grants. In his weekly Internet address Saturday, Obama stated that through the reform he hopes to achieve his goal for America to “once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by the end of this decade.”
With the passage of this bill and the health care reform the president has garnered two huge victories, effectively quieting his opposition. If you were asking where Obama’s “change” is, you’ve just experienced it.
During this school year, more than 60 percent of students receive some sort of financial aid at USC (which totals around $375 million), and with this bill, both the number of recipients and money available at the university should increase. This is particularly true with federal, private and parent loans, which account for about 33 percent of USC’s financial aid.
The reform, which will be run by the American government, saves taxpayers $68 million dollars by cutting out private banks as middlemen for student loans. No longer will large private banks profit from students who need loans to attend school via fees and high interest rates. No longer will these institutions, with their bureaucratic wastefulness, hinder any future students from receiving a college education.
$40 billion of the money saved will be used to increase both the aid to lower-income students and the amount of Pell Grants offered to students. The cap on Pell Grants is also expected to rise to between $350 and $625 — a small, but important improvement. That amount is the difference between a student having all of his required books and sitting in class looking off of his neighbor’s textbook.
Additionally, the reform also eases the entire loan process for students. A graduate’s repayments will be capped at 10 percent of one’s income for people who get loans after July 1, 2014, and some may receive lower interest rates and higher approval rates. By capping repayments at 10 percent, students will have an easier time paying off their loans, relieving some stress after graduation.
This cap could produce a new freedom of career path as low-paying professions have been avoided by graduates because of high debt. Jobs that are crucial to society, like teaching, could see a resurgence of interest when graduates only have to pay a 10 percent maximum of their income for loans.
With a lower payment requirement, teaching could provide for a livable future, and students could be encouraged to pursue degrees in fields such as art history, math or English. Creativity could also flourish within the education systems as students studying in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences could explore more thought provoking and critical thinking majors, as they would be less worried about high student loans after graduation.
Any student who wishes to study at a university and receive a diploma should not be discouraged to enroll in classes because of climbing tuition rates. With the education bill, Congress has sidestepped private interest and put the American student first by creating a way to manage the cost of a diploma.
Obama stated that he wants “to make sure our students don’t go broke just because they chose to go to college,” and on Tuesday, the threat of college debt should no longer be at the forefront of students’ minds.
John Gudenzi is a junior majoring in English.
The change to student loans was a federal take-over. The government can’t compete with the private banks, so now all loans will be delivered by government monopoly. Even liberal economics professors recognize the dangers of monopolies. Instead of graduating in debt to a bank of your choice, who you could sue if necessary, you will be in debt to the federal government for 20 years or more, with no option of ever filing for bankruptcy. Congratulations, you are now an indentured servant, and the federal government is your master.
hahahahaha…wait, let me get up off the floor, I was laughing so hard I fell off my chair. I think this English major lost me at the line about “bureaucratic wastefulness” of the private banks–as opposed to the “non bureaucratic wastefulness” of who will be administering this now, the federal government? Wait, I’m having a laughing fit again.
And Obama’s “two huge victories” have effectively quieted the opposition? Uh, John, do you ever read a newspaper besides the DT? 
Thanks for the laugh.

When I was little, I dribbled a fistful of soil into my mouth out of curiosity about its flavor.
The yearning to learn the characteristics of our world is widespread. To some, the compulsion manifests itself in odd ways, but seekers of truth are a common species, curious always about everything: the origins of the universe and the purpose of life on Earth.
It is often the feverish inquirers who grudgingly sign up for the required science general education courses, not realizing what USC has to offer in terms of the sciences. Although the questions of life fascinate students, many think science sucks the magic out of everything. Some thrive on that sense of awe that fills them when they contemplate what they don’t understand — the poetry inherent within the mysterious. To them, science is the enemy of this feeling.
But students should think twice before registering for the easiest-looking science class for next fall with the intention of sleeping through it
I used to hate science. When my grade-school physics teacher explained that apples fall from trees because of this inevitable force called gravity, I thought with horror that he had killed my ability to be amazed by the experience of being rooted to the planet. “It may seem like this beautiful miracle to be alive, but it’s actually very explainable mathematically and scientifically and logically and you must memorize and embrace the dreariness of it all,” my science teachers seemed to say.

But soon, the hypocrisy of my perspective was elucidated: I claimed to be in love with something that I was too afraid to look at in the face for fear that it might not actually be beautiful. I was seeking “the secret of life” without taking the time to get to know what life was.
The enthusiasm and expertise of USC professors like neuroscientist William McClure and science journalist K.C. Cole revealed that the heart of each scientific discipline throbs with an immortal magic. Sure, we can explain that a sperm meets an egg and triggers a cascade of cell growth and division that eventually becomes a human baby; how an enormous explosion at the beginning of time caused the universe to come into existence; how the stimulation of brain cells gives rise to behaviors and perceptions.
But the fact is that biology, physics and neuroscience are actually revealing the ultimate unknowability of the world in a way that lends even those outside of religious circles to believe there is some force behind all the inner workings in the natural world.
USC has many science professors who aren’t afraid to admit what they don’t know — what science can’t seem to figure out.
Scientists still have no idea why life or the universe or thoughts occur. We can explain how these phenomena happen and what they look like but not what is behind them.
For example, we can explain that thoughts occur because neurons in my brain fire in a very precise way. But though the material covered in a General Education such as Brain, Mind and Machines: Topics in Neuroscience (BISC 230) could help us understand the process, even its professor would be hard pressed to find an answer as to why they fired. What is the initial push that caused this squiggle in my brain? It is inexplicable, just as the initial “push” behind the Big Bang is inexplicable.
Science cannot strangle “the secret of life” because it is by nature inscrutable. It cannot be gotten hold of. The ultimate question — why are we here? — seems outside of our capacity to answer. It is like trying to see the eye with the eye. You can only know, intuitively, that you are a part of it, that the answer is somehow you.
We are the universe looking at itself. Life is the only thing in the world capable of perceiving the world, of giving it meaning and trying to discover its nature. We can study and characterize the limbs, the body, of that from which we sprouted, but its ultimate secret is unknowable. It seems to be locked within what we are looking at it with — consciousness itself.
The resultant elusiveness doesn’t mean the pursuit of science is pointless. Rather this is the realization that, unlike anything else, science education can make the spirits soar.

“… science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of the flower. I don’t see how it subtracts.”

Tony Miller, the strength and conditioning manager for the USC men’s basketball team, has been promoted to assistant coach, USC coach Kevin O’Neill announced Friday.
This season was Miller’s first with the team. However, his history with O’Neill goes back further.
“I’ve known Tony for 20 years and feel he’ll do a great job in every aspect for our program,” O’Neill said.
From 1991-1995, Miller was a point guard at Marquette where O’Neill was the head coach during Miller’s first three seasons. Miller served as team captain during his final three years on the team. The team made it to the NCAA tournament twice, highlighted by a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1994.
“He was a great player for me at Marquette and will be a great coach for us at USC,” O’Neill said.
After playing in college, Miller spent 12 years playing professionally in Europe for teams in Belgium, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and Holland. In addition, he was a Dutch League All-Star in 1998 and 2000. His team won the Dutch League title in 1998.
Miller is listed as seventh all-time in career assists among Division I basketball players. With a career collegiate total of 956, he has the most assists of any player in the history of Marquette basketball.
Earlier this month, O’Neill decided that he would not keep two assistant coaches, Gib Arnold and Phil Johnson, on his staff for next season. Both of them joined the team when Tim Floyd was USC’s coach.

Nine of the main Los Angeles libraries face Sunday closures and more than 60 branches will shorten hours because of recent losses in personnel.
The Board of Library Commissioners voted Thursday on a plan suggesting Sunday closures for the Central Library downtown and the eight regional libraries.  Branch libraries are already closed on Sundays.
The plan would also close all of the city’s libraries at 6 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays, and the eight regional libraries would open at noon rather than 10 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
A program that offered workers the opportunity to retire up to five years early with full benefits will leave the city understaffed starting in early April, when 107 library employees are expected to leave.
“We can barely get by,” Roy Stone, president of the Librarian’s Guild AFSCME Local 2626, told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday.
According to the Times, because of a citywide hiring freeze, about 8 percent of the positions in the city’s 1,132-employee library department are vacant.
With the city facing a budget gap of $485 million and as many as 4,000 job cuts next fiscal year, further reductions in library hours are expected.  City Councilman Tom LaBonge said city officials will continue to explore options to ensure libraries stay open during their busiest hours, which he said are 3:30 p.m. to closing.
