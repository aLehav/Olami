Exchange students in the Marshall School of Business complete a scavenger hunt as part of their programming. Charlotte Wulff | Daily Trojan
One month ago, 133 Marshall exchange students made their way to Los Angeles from all around the globe. For some it was a bigger culture shock than for others, but I believe I speak on behalf of all of us when I say that the past four weeks have been filled with new experiences. I study business administration at my home university, Erasmus University of Rotterdam, and chose to come to USC for a semester so that I can take music industry classes, catch some of that Californian sunshine and get a taste of the true American college life.
Though I am Dutch by nationality, I spent my childhood living in Germany, India and Australia. Growing up in different countries has impacted my life in many ways, most notably in that I do not get homesick. For many other exchange students, living in Los Angeles is the first time they are away from their hometown and family, but this is not the case for me. I have lived across the globe from my parents (who currently reside in Sydney) for the past two and a half years and the concept of “hometown” does not really exist for me. The only person I ever really miss when going abroad is my boyfriend.
Despite all this, packing up my things and boarding a plane to an entirely different continent was nerve racking.
Will I make friends? What will my roommate be like? Will I like my classes? These were some of the thoughts running through my head.
I did not need to worry, though, because the Trojan Family has welcomed me with open arms. People have helped me find my way every time I get lost on campus — because even though the USC campus is small by American standards, it is a lot bigger than my campus back home — and I have made friends in every class. I could not have asked for more amazing people to share my apartment with at the Lorenzo, and all my professors are incredibly inspiring (shout out to Paul Young who teaches “Basics of the Music Industry”).
Fitting everything I have done these past few weeks into one post is impossible. A few things I have done so far, though are: learned how to pay rent by check (the ’90s are calling, they want their banking system back), taken a glorious nap on Santa Monica beach, eaten Chipotle (which is amazing), stood in a couple of fountains on campus for a scavenger hunt, been to a frat party, waited in line for a warehouse sale in the sweltering L.A heat and attended the Arkansas vs. USC football game after tailgating (which deserves its own post). I also joined the lovely people of KXSC as a radio station intern. Side note — if you ever see people walking around campus in a robot suit, they are KXSC interns and you should give them some love.
All in all, my first impressions of USC and Los Angeles did not disappoint. I do not know how the rest of the semester will unfold, but of one thing I am sure — this is going to be one crazy, fun, school-spirit filled ride.
Wat leuk dat je op USC zit. Ik werk voor USC in de Joint Educational project (JEP). Ik heet Dieuwertje, kom maar langs. Ik zou je graag willen ontmoeten. Groetjes DJ

The Hoose Library of Philosophy is a quiet place on campus, perfect for getting lost in your textbooks. Cody Uyeda | Daily Trojan
As the third week of classes wraps up, it’s safe to say that school is officially in full swing, which means beginning to prepare for that inevitable onslaught of midterms, group projects and papers that we’d rather not think about.
Though Leavey Library’s infamous pastel-colored halls may be many a student’s choice of study prison, there are other lesser-known, but often more effective, places to go and get your work done. So, when you need some serious work time but don’t want to deal with the crowds in Leavey or the noise of the campus center, here are five spaces on campus that you should check out if you’re looking to really get into that studying state of mind
1. Hoose Library of Philosophy
Located on the second floor of Mudd Hall at the end of Trousdale, the philosophy library is truly one of USC’s hidden gems. Beautiful and austere, but also intimate and cozy, this is the place to go if you are looking to get some work done in blissful silence, surrounded by the antique chairs and stained glass windows that just might be the inspiration you need to make it through that reading you’ve been putting off since last week.
2. Cinematic Arts Library book stacks
The stacks may seem an odd place to go voluntarily, but that also means that if you’re looking to work with little to no interruption, this is the place to be. To reach this space, take the stairs one flight down when you first enter Doheny Library, then head right and locate the cinema library. Once there, head towards the back and look for a little doorway in the wall; that’s the Cinematic Arts Library stacks. Tucked alongside the shelves of books are cubicles, each complete with their own lamp and outlets. This is definitely not the place to hold a study party, but rest assured that if you want undisturbed time alone, this is the place to be.
3. Third floor of the Campus Center
Though many associate the Tutor Campus Center with lunch at Lemonade or a morning caffeine boost from Coffee Bean, it can also be a great place to go and get work done as well. If you take the elevator up to the third floor, you’ll find another of USC’s amazing but often overlooked study spots. With beautiful, carpeted hallways lined with comfy window seating, this is the perfect place to work and enjoy the vibrant ambiance of the Campus Center without all the noise and distraction down on the ground floor.
4. Annenberg Digital Lounge
Though it is located in Annenberg, this space is open to all students, and offers comfortable seating and tables to work at, in addition to beautiful views of the campus from strategically placed window seats. To get here, find the new Annenberg building next to the USC Bookstore, and head up to the third floor, to the right of the elevator. If you’re looking for a cozy place to unwind and get some work done on those lazy Southern California afternoons, definitely come and check out the Annenberg Digital Lounge.
5. The South Lawn behind the Roski School
Lastly, if you’re the type who likes the sun on your skin or the breeze through your hair while you work, check out the South Lawn located directly behind the Roski School of Art and Design. What truly makes this space relaxing is that unlike the grassy expanses of McCarthy Quad and Alumni Park, you won’t be in danger of interfering with an afternoon frisbee game, nor will you be distracted by the near constant bike and pedestrian traffic in most other parts of campus. As such, this beautiful, grassy expanse dotted with shady trees and thought provoking sculptures is perfect place to relax and find the inspiration for that one essay you just can’t seem to make headway on.

Last Sunday was an early morning for junior Ariana Shives.
Shives is president of Kicks for Kids, a student organization that provides exercise opportunities for disabled children in the community every Sunday. Hours before the event started, Shives and other volunteers carried their equipment from apartments scattered around the USC campus, taking two to three trips to lug soccer balls, goals, boxes of food and other items to McCarthy Quad.
Without a storage space on campus, the 12-member Kicks for Kids executive board is forced to store everything required for their club in their own residences. It’s a logistical issue that they say takes up hours of extra time and effort each week — and it’s something that Shives wants the University to address.
“Student organizations are an integral part of campus life, and I think it’s the job of the administration to support that,” Shives said. “This is something that we struggle with on a daily basis, and it feels like such an unnecessary struggle. We should not have to worry about this.”
A lack of storage space isn’t a problem unique to Kicks for Kids. The University doesn’t provide storage space for any student organization.
Both Shives and senior Dawson Ray of USC Science Outreach contacted Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath last year to voice their concerns. Sampath discussed the topic with Assistant Vice Provost for Student Affairs Monique Allard, who explained that providing storage was impossible due to a lack of on-campus space.
“The space issue is something student government is exploring for various communities on campus,” Sampath said. “As an urban campus, it may be difficult to accommodate some of these needs but as we continue to expand our University with projects such as the University Village, I think it is important to explore our options and meet student needs.”
The main difficulty for the University is the sheer number of organizations. There are 835 student organizations on campus, ranging from club sports to backpacking groups, and each has specific storage needs.
According to Programs Manager of Campus Activities Christina Mireles, while the University could provide adequate storage for some clubs, it would be nearly impossible to provide it for all of them.
“When you consider the vast array of student organizations that might need storage, from rowing shells to equestrian horses, from elaborate engineering projects to Japanese fighting swords, there is not a way to have enough stuff to store everything for everyone that might need it on campus,” Mireles said. “As it is, most departments don’t have storage space on campus, only a few do, and many share that space.”
This was the response that the administration gave Kicks for Kids, Science Outreach and other organizations who requested storage space in the past. However, it wasn’t enough for Shives, Ray and other student organization leaders.
“What we hope to see is the administration at least attempting to help us out, even if they can’t do much,” Shives said. “It’s discouraging and frustrating to hear your school just say ‘no’ flat-out, without even examining any options.”
Last year, Ray reached out to other student organizations in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and found that many — including SC Outfitters and Trojan Dance Marathon — struggled with the same issues. Some organizations stored equipment with a professor or with the department that sponsored them. However, this still made it hard for those organizations to access their equipment on weekends or at other times when professors were out of the office.
“No matter what solution someone came up with, whether that was off-campus storage or putting their stuff under a professor’s desk, there were problems with it,” Ray said. “There wasn’t a perfect solution because there simply wasn’t space to fit things.”
Students said they want the discussion to be about how to provide storage, not about whether it is possible at all. Shives said it would be enough if the University provided each club with a locker for organizational equipment.
Ray believes that a viable solution would be to create an application process that allows organizations to request storage space based on their specific needs. Both agreed that to begin fixing this issue, the University needs to be willing to have an open conversation.
“I think what we want to see the most is a dialogue between the administration and the students,” Shives said. “We want to be heard and we want to work towards a solution. This isn’t a yes-or-no issue. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, not ignored, and we hope that we can see USC do that in the future.”

Former White House speechwriter for the Obama Administration, Jon Favreau, spoke at the Von Kleinsmid Center Monday afternoon on his experience as a political speechwriter and his current work at Fenway Strategies, a public relations/speechwriting agency, in which he is a founding partner.
Political science professor Bob Shrum moderated the talk, titled, “Do Words Have Power?“
Shrum began the forum by pointing out that Favreau was one of the youngest chief speechwriters for any president in history.
Favreau said the president is very “hands-on,” unlike other presidents — most notably Nixon who preferred a corporate hands-off approach.
Favreau pointed out that the only way to create a successful speech is to integrate details on a personal level.
“Speechwriting is an incredibly personal process you are trying to integrate thoughts and beliefs with personal stories,” Favreau said. “The only way you can do that is by forming a relationship with the other person.”
Furthermore, Favreau expressed the importance of focused speechwriting to the students in attendance. The speechwriter pointed out that having too many ideas in a speech can be confusing .
“When there are too many cooks in the kitchen, the speech is bad,” Favreau said.
Shrum, toward the end of his section of the discussion, steered Favreau toward the personal style of Obama and the speechwriting relationship Favreau developed with the president.
Favreau described his speeches as taking on an extremely logical writing style, per Obama’s vision.
“The constitutional professor [and] the legal mind really comes through with him,” Favreau said. “He is extremely logical, extremely ordered in his thinking, which is one of the most important things in speechwriting.”
Favreau described the varied instances in which first drafts would come back with few edits from the president and other times in which the paper would be “covered in black ink.”
Obama’s nuanced and specific speech style is what Favreau, referred to by Obama as “Favs,” seemed to strive for in his time in the Obama Administration. Favreau referred to Obama’s perfectionism when making edits to speeches, saying that the president was still editing his election night speech “even as states were being called.”
Favreau went on to take questions from the audience, ranging from the role of technology and the role of humor in speechwriting and his opinions on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
According to Favreau, Clinton hasn’t been connecting to viewers as well as she can be.
“I think that she has missed an opportunity to give big speeches and lay out a vision,” Favreau said. “Running for president is about laying out your vision.”
Afterward, Favreau pointed out Trump’s ability to connect to the public with his lack of political correctness.
“He has really exposed the phoniness of politics,” Favreau said. “People are like, at least he’s real.”
Additionally, Favreau said Trump and Obama are similar because they are both authentic.
“Authenticity forms, from above all else, fearlessness,” Favreau said. “[Trump’s] such a narcissist that he doesn’t care.”
Favreau also discussed the State of the Union address and jokingly referred to it as a “beast of a process.”
He said that the State of the Union requires diligent preparation with the president regarding themes and topics which must be started months before.
Favreau closed with what he views as the most important element of speechwriting — storytelling.
“A speech is a story with a beginning, middle and an end,” Favreau said. “It all comes down to transitions; you want to make sure every idea in the speech flows seamlessly to the next.”

Kerry Washington, star of the ABC hit television series Scandal, spoke at Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday evening on her career, upbringing and stance on political issues.
This session was primarily scheduled for students in JOUR 381: Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society and JOUR 599: Special Topics.
Mary Murphy, senior lecturer at Annenberg and professor of the aforementioned classes, interviewed Washington. She started off by asking Washington what her ambitions and dreams were as a child.
“I didn’t think I would be an actor when I was young,” Washington said. “To be an actor you have to want to be famous and I was not one of those girls. I just wanted to make a living doing something that I wanted to do — physiology, teaching or communication — and study the role of performance and identity.”
Washington has starred in the movies Django Unchained and Ray, but is most well-known for her role as Olivia Pope on Scandal. In that series, she was nominated for a Golden Globe for “Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series-Drama. .”
Washington also touched on race relations, specifically in television and movies throughout the night.
“I never felt pressured to be extra good because there aren’t many other black women in the roles that I play,” Washington said. “We long for inclusivity or anything that closes that gap — it makes for great storytelling.”
The talk of race followed laughs and cheers as Washington’s debut in Saturday Night Live was projected onto the screen behind the stage as she played different famous black women, mocking the lack of black women on the cast of the show.
As Washington is involved with the political drama, Scandal, a discussion arose regarding how television shows like House of Cards and Scandal portray cynicism about government.
“In West Wing, for example, viewers needed a more idealized president because they were frustrated with the current one,” Washington said. “Currently, it is the other way around.”
Following the teaser trailer for season five of Scandal, the discussion was opened up to the rest of the audience.
One student asked if Washington makes decisions about work from a creative standpoint or from a popularity standpoint.
“I don’t pick a job because it is good for the people,” Washington said.  “It is because the job interests me.”
She made it clear that she does not let what other people think of her sway her sense of justice.
“My career is a test for me to not quiet my sense of justice for the sake of my career,” Washington said. “I stay true to myself by leaning into the people around me. The goal is not self-reliance but of community.”
Washington ended the discussion by explaining how and why she strives to balance her creativity with her education.
Megan Daly, a junior majoring in communication, said she respects Washington.
“I admire her as an actor and a business person and her ability with social media,” Daly said. “I thought she was candid and honest with all of us.”
Larkan Kelly, a freshman majoring in political science, said Washington and the characters she plays inspire her to help others.
“She’s my idol,” Kelly said. “She’s had a big influence on me pursuing political science because of her political advocacy for other people.”
One of the main takeaways of Washington’s speaking event has to do with the empowering nature of education, which she made many references to during the talk.
“My job is to reflect humanity because the less we know about human beings the less educated we are,” Washington said. “Being empowered to do things your own way is your greatest asset. If you don’t figure out what is unique about yourself and don’t stand courageously then we all lose out on your gift.”

Grammy-nominated musician Lana Del Rey has been slowly revealing singles off of her new album, Honeymoon, leaving fans eagerly anticipating its release. Her previous albums, Born to Die and Ultraviolence, have received international success and have marketed Del Rey’s dreamy, soft, melancholic sound to a wider audience. Based on what has been unveiled so far, Honeymoon shouldn’t disappoint fans who have been waiting two years for a new album.
Her persona is very much like her music — artistic, enigmatic and unreal. Though many artists have been known to connect their personal lives to their music, often sharing details of their lives to fans, Del Rey is more mysterious in the way she chooses to reveal herself.  No one knows what she is really like. She could be the girl who ditches class to smoke alone by herself. She could be the quiet girl in your class who secretly writes beautiful poetry. She could be the party girl who goes out every night. Strictly private about personal matters, Del Rey is always leaving everything to the imagination of her fans, making her even more intriguing.
In “Honeymoon Sampler,” a hazy, Polaroid-looking video with snippets and names of a few tracks on the album, Del Rey executes her infamous hipster style to perfection. She is first seen wearing a large red sun hat in the back of a truck, later in a long white, flowy dress holding a gun. Shots of the ocean with long-haired girls swimming and dancing in it, then touching Del Rey while she closes her eyes, all contribute to the abstract taste of the video.
Though Honeymoon is intended to sound more similar to Born to Die rather than Ultraviolence, there are certain elements of both in the singles she has currently previewed and released. Born to Die served as an introduction to her slow, sad and romantic pop style in which she sings about the American Dream fulfilled while Ultraviolence, though similar in gloom, leans more towards the dramatic and violent, emphasizing the death of the American Dream with a taste of the blues. The songs already released in Honeymoon are “Honeymoon,” “High by the Beach,” “Terrence Loves You” and snippets of “Music to Watch Boys To.” In these singles, Del Rey proves that though her sound is evolving, she is staying true to her dark and somber style.
Del Rey’s new songs represent extensions from her previous ones. The lyrics present a sense of maturity — “High by the Beach” paints a picture of solitude. With “The truth is I never bought into your bullsh-t / When you would pay tribute to me cause I know that / All I wanted to do was get high by the beach / Get high baby, baby, bye bye,” it’s evident that Del Rey has graduated from her perpetual need to be with a man in the past to a profound snapshot of loneliness. Additionally, the title track of the album, “Honeymoon,” includes references to areas in Los Angeles. Del Rey offers a more optimistic outlook with lyrics like, “We could cruise to the blues / Wilshire Boulevard if we choose / Or whatever you wanna do / We make the rules.” This track proves that Del Rey has started to break free from the stoic and somber image she once portrayed.
Honeymoon is set to be released on Sept. 18.
Westcoast (from Ultraviolence) was a prelude to Honeymoon. Listen to the lyrics…listen to the sound, the rhythm.
ULTRAVIOLENCE came out LAST YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With the end of 2015 only a couple months away, the inevitable annual roundups will soon be splashed across every newsfeed and timeline. Best albums, movies, celebrity break-ups and buzzwords of the year will be ranked from best to worst, by top 10 and in no particular order. One of the inevitable buzzwords that will no doubt be mentioned again this year will be “feminism.” Feminism has been on all our minds as injustices among the sexes have continued to escalate while being placed under intense scrutiny. With the advent of social media and digital sharing, we are now, more than ever, acutely aware to the degree with which the inequalities of our nation continue to be perpetuated every day.
Among these inequalities, the media’s stereotypical depiction of male dominance in cinema continues to be a vital issue. It’s very easy to say that Hollywood perpetuates the use of white leading men in films while giving little to no roles to women (white or otherwise) year after year. According to the New York Film Academy, only around 30 percent of speaking roles in the top 500 U.S. films belong to women.
Additionally, it’s almost universally acknowledged that female directors in science fiction are virtually non-existent, and female writers are often cast into the shadows. Case in point: Nicole Perlman was part of Marvel’s now-disbanded Writers Program and personally re-discovered and nursed the Guardians of the Galaxy property to maturation before it was taken away and handed to a man to be re-written.
On the story side, women characters are also often merely supplements to men (case in point: Zoe Saldana’s female alien character amongst three males in the aforementioned Guardians) or even just used as decoration, as in the case of Alice Eve — and her superfluous underwear scene — as the decorative Lt. Carol Marcus in J.J. Abrams’s Star Trek: Into Darkness, released in 2013. However, there are some futuristic films this year that will hopefully gain traction in the sci-fi world.
The 5th Wave is an upcoming female-led drama flick starring Chloë Grace Moretz. Moretz plays a young woman who must survive an alien invasion that carries out its attack on humans in stages, or waves. Not only will the film hopefully open up the sci-fi genre to a wider audience, but it will also continue to set an example that female-led movies can not only be produced but can also break the box office. Furthermore, USC alumna Victoria Aveyard’s science-fiction novel Red Queen is not only being adapted into a film but will also be helmed by actress-turned-director Elizabeth Banks.
Of course, Jennifer Lawrence’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 will undoubtedly shatter holiday box office records. However, neither The Hunger Games franchise nor its similarly successful counterpart Divergent (starring Shailene Woodley) satisfy the argument that science fiction has made room for strong women. On the contrary, they actually appear to perpetuate a unique stereotype of their own. Both films feature an extremely similar female lead in a dilapidated, dystopian future. It seems the studios suggest that the only world that could possibly have a woman at its center is a completely nonexistent reality, wherein the current rules and establishment of our patriarchal society have completely dissolved into ruin. Only then, it seems, could women have the power to strike out against the status quo. Furthermore, by the continued creation and emphasis on these similar plotlines and cinematic conventions, the studios continue to perpetuate that this is the only type of female-led film that can survive the box office. Neither of these conclusions are acceptable nor true.
In the late ’90s, Robert Zemeckis graced the cinematic landscape with the Jodie Foster science fiction film Contact, which not only featured a strong female lead but was also firmly rooted in a reality we could recognize: the mid ’90s, replete with plaid shirts and Bill Clinton. In addition to often being the smartest woman in the room, Foster’s Eleanor Arroway chose her diligent work over the charming Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) even after spending a night with him. After losing her research grant and having to decide between staying in the town she met Palmer in or leaving and pursuing other financial options, Eleanor leaves him without even saying goodbye. Furthermore, when given the chance to live the rest of her life in peace or venture deep into the far recesses of space with no guarantee that she will return alive, Eleanor chooses the latter, ultimately deciding her pursuit of knowledge is more important than a normal life on Earth. Her choice is not only radical for a human being, but it is also infinitely more radical for a woman — when we, as an audience, have time and time again been told that the number one priority in a woman’s life should be the pursuit of a man. If Zemeckis can do it in the ’90s, there’s room for a similar movie now.
As we begin to look to fall movies, it’s important to realize that female Hollywood characters represent so much more than their storyline. As moviegoers, it’s our responsibility to consider how women in films can be more than a one-note, archetypal character.

Much to every Trojan fan’s delight, the 2015 squad has started the season with two statement wins by a difference of 49 and 50 points. The team has looked good as a unit and Cody and JuJu have both set career records only two games into the season. The Trojans are riding a huge wave of momentum heading into Saturday’s game against Stanford, but need to be careful not to repeat the outcome of the 2012 season.
Circumstances are eerily similar to USC’s 2012 demise. No. 2 USC headed to the Bay Area to face the Cardinal in the third game of the season after two dominant wins over Hawai’i and Syracuse. Matt Barkley and a Trojan team that had received so much preseason hype fell to      No. 21 Stanford and went on to finish the season 7-6 overall and 5-4 in the Pac-12.
Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that will happen again, and I think this year’s team is a far cry from 2012 — but that doesn’t mean a conference rival should be overlooked. In fact, the following season it was Cody Kessler and an interim head coach who upset the No. 4 Cardinal and dashed their hopes of a national title.
Cody Kessler, who is looking to go 3-0 against Stanford, has never looked better. He had a career-high 410 yards against Idaho. He completed 26 of 31 passes and had three touchdown passes on the night. He even showed improvement on his deep balls, something he struggled with against Arkansas State, opening the game with a 50-yard touchdown pass to JuJu. Kessler is currently the only quarterback in college football with at least seven touchdown passes to no interceptions.
Cody’s favorite target JuJu also had a career night against Idaho. Smith-Schuster had 10 catches for 192 yards and two touchdowns of 50 and 41 yards. Tre Madden and Justin Davis each scored two touchdowns as well.
Seemingly hiding in the shadow of such an explosive offense, the Trojans’ defense has held Arkansas State and Idaho to six and nine points, respectively.
All of the above information should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as USC has hosted two Sun Belt teams. Stanford, though currently unranked, will be USC’s first real test this season.
Unlike USC’s 49-point win, Stanford opened its season with an upset  to Northwestern. Northwestern is 2-0 and has now cracked the top 25, coming in this week at No. 23, but the Cardinal offense looked abysmal, putting up only six points and failing to score a touchdown.
If this wasn’t a conference rivalry game, this matchup would probably have very little significance to anyone other than the two teams playing, and even then most people would probably just use it as an excuse to tailgate and then leave after the first quarter. But this is Stanford and USC, and as I was writing this sentence, ESPN aired a preview for the game.
The fact is, this is a rivalry game with national significance. Even though USC has handed the Sun Belt conference a beating thus far, this is the Pac-12 and anything can happen.

Coming off back-to-back convincing victories over Sun Belt conference teams that vaulted the USC Trojans up two spots in the rankings, on Monday coach Steve Sarkisian addressed the strong start and what lies ahead.
USC outscored Arkansas State and Idaho State by a combined score of 114-15, but Sarkisian still saw some room for improvements in week 2.
“I thought our younger players looked more comfortable in week 2,” Sarkisian said. “Up front offensively in the run game and in pass protection, we made strides, and that came from communicating. Our communication was vastly improved up front.”
On defense, Sarkisian also thought his team was “much better” against Idaho State.
“We held Idaho to four yards per play, which is a really good number for us,” he said. “We were really good on third down again, getting off the field on defense.”
Sarkisian lauded the play of running backs Justin Davis, Ronald Jones II and Tre Madden, and also singled out wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster.
“In week 1, JuJu tried too hard,” Sarkisian said. “We tried to get him to calm down … and he did that. He blocked all night long. He cleared out routes for other guys. He played on special teams. If he can replicate his effort and energy, that guy’s poised for a great season.”
The focus now shifts to Stanford, which figures to be USC’s first true test against      Pac-12 competition. Sarkisian noted disciplined as the key to the game.
“Stanford’s a very disciplined defense,” he said. “They don’t blow coverages. They don’t give up the big play. Cody [Kessler’s] going to have to remain discipline and continue to protect the football.”
Sarkisian also pointed out the challenge of facing a dynamic and adaptable team in the Cardinal.
“If you allow [Stanford] to line up with eight offensive linemen on the field, run the ball and get four to five yards at a time, they’ll stay in it,” Sarkisian said. “If you allow them to open their sets up and play pitch and catch and get six to seven yards in the quick game, they’ll do that. That’s the sign of a good coaching staff.”
Stanford is led by redshirt senior quarterback Kevin Hogan, who the Trojans will try to stop from gaining momentum.
“When he’s comfortable in the pocket and he strings together a few passes in a row, he can get hot,” Sarkisian said. “It’s going to be critical for us to try to make him as uncomfortable as we can.”
Despite the improved quality of their opponent, Sarkisian wanted the team’s focus to remain on themselves.
“We just need to stick to our process,” he said. “Focus on us and what we need to do to get ourselves prepared to play.”

Senior All-American outside hitter Samantha Bricio earned her third consecutive Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week honors for the week of Sept. 7-13 after her stellar play propelled the women’s volleyball team to an undefeated record and a newly minted No. 3 national ranking.
The Guadalajara, Mexico, native is just the second player in Pac-12 history to receive the award three times in a row in one season since Stanford’s Logan Tom did it in 2001. This is Bricio’s sixth all-time weekly conference award and USC’s 62nd all-time weekly honor.
This week, the Women of Troy played host to four teams at the Galen Center as part of the 2015 USC Classic tournament. Led by Bricio, USC swept Utah State, Pepperdine, Idaho State and New Mexico to push their record to a perfect 10-0 on the season.
Against the Aggies of Utah State, Bricio tied her own  career-high and the USC single-match record with eight service aces. Later that day, Bricio served up five more aces against Pepperdine to mark the 15th time in her career that she served five or more aces in the a match. She also hit at an impressive .404 clip in those four matches, tallying 67 kills to average 5.58 kills per set.
In the process, the Women of Troy collected their 29th straight set win with those four sweeps. Bricio was named tournament MVP for the eighth time in her career for a pre-conference tournament, and it was the 13th time she was chosen to be on an all-tournament team.
Furthermore, the senior moved up the record books for career kills after the USC Classic, surpassing three former Trojan legends, Katie Haller (ninth), Nancy Hillman (eighth) and April Ross (seventh), to now sit at sixth all-time in USC history with 1,586 career kills.
With the help of Bricio’s near unstoppable play this week, USC moved up three spots in the AVCA poll and now sits at No. 3 overall in the nation. It took just 10 games and three weeks for the Women of Troy to jump 19 spots from their preseason ranking of No. 22 overall.
Ahead of USC in the poll is   No. 1 Penn State, followed by   No. 2 Texas and rounding out the top five are Nebraska at No. 4 and Florida at No. 5 overall.
Around the Pac-12 conference, five more teams are ranked in this week’s AVCA poll, led by   No. 7 Washington, No. 8 Stanford and No. 10 Arizona State. Crosstown rival UCLA is ranked No. 14 overall and Oregon sits at No. 19 in the polls. Lastly, fellow conference member Colorado is also receiving votes.
Bricio and the Women of Troy will now prepare for their final week of non-conference play with a trip to Norman, Oklahoma, to partake in the Oklahoma Nike Invitational on Sept. 17-18.

As another school year rears its head, state legislators must again face California’s poor education standards. In an effort to keep students in school and promote higher education, legislatures are pushing a pending mandate for kindergarten education.
Though the majority of students at USC probably went to kindergarten, it is not fully mainstream. This first year of education is entirely optional, and most of our memories of kindergarten include nap time, recess and the occasional piece of homework. However, there is value in attending. Even though kids are learning in kindergarten, the main focus of the first year of schooling often tends to be social interaction. Kindergarteners make friends and learn to play with new people, skills that will form the foundation of social interactions for the rest of their lives. Many parents agree that attending kindergarten is important for their kids to become more independent and spend time away from home — and indeed, kindergarten is crucial for full educational development.
Opponents of the movement say that parents should be allowed to choose whether or not their kids attend kindergarten because parents always have their children’s best interests in mind. While this is not always the case, parents often like having a say in their child’s life. There is a compromise within the motion as it holds true to the current provision that all 6-year-olds must be in school. Even if the parent wants to delay schooling, the 6-year-old will still be allowed in kindergarten, fulfilling both rules, should kindergarten become mandatory. The mandate would also remind the public of the level of importance schools play for children.
Kindergarten also impacts students after early childhood, as attending kindergarten prevents students from falling behind in first grade. The mandate would prioritize education early on, creating a foundation to succeed in middle and high school.
California’s high school graduation rate has been steadily climbing since 2010, and the class of 2014 boasted a graduation rate of 80.8 percent, according to State Supt. of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson. Coupled with the removal of the exit exam, mandatory kindergarten will encourage students in all grades to complete their schooling.
State Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris noted that California school districts lose $1.4 billion per year to truancy as a result of students missing school frequently. These frightening levels of absentees often correspond with the state’s “chronic criminal justice problems.” Staying in school improves much more than just attendance, allowing the state bill in question to act as a first step to solve our education crisis.
Education in California has slowly buried itself in regulations and bureaucratic problems. It is true that the state has much more to solve than just getting students to show up to class. But the first step to fixing the bigger problems — the ones often dealing with the regulation-obsessed nature of the education system — is ensuring that schools do not lose funding because of excessive absences. If the state can save $1.4 billion from these truants, then we are one step closer to an education curriculum that can improve the quality of education students are receiving. Not only that, but attending school will mitigate the socioeconomic gap.
By requiring children to attend kindergarten every day, the bill hopes to instill the value of education at a very young age. Since kindergarten is the primary building block for the rest of the K-12 school system, it is for the best that these students learn to come to school early on in their educational career. While it may not seem important for kindergarten, the practice remains consistent throughout one’s life; a Baltimore study from 2013 showed that sixth-grade attendance rates corresponded strongly with graduating on time. Staying in school also aims to lessen the achievement gap, especially within the minorities. According to a recent study conducted at the University of Michigan, “children in the highest socioeconomic group entering kindergarten have cognitive scores 60 percent higher than those of children in the lowest socioeconomic group.” Unless the state legislature takes bold actions (like mandating kindergarten), these gaps could play bigger roles later in their lives and their earnings.
By making this move, California takes the first step in eliminating barriers in the rigid structure of public education and gives the state’s students, from kindergarten to college, the hope they need.
“the bill hopes” There is no evidence that mandatory kindergarten attendance instills a desire to continue to go to school. School is an artificial environment of socialization. In no other organization are people separated out by age so rigidly. After the few short years of schooling one is expected to join “the real world” where organizations are more rationally divided. Kindergarten is entirely optional and should stay that way.

With a new semester in full swing, college students have a lot on their plates. Some midterms have already begun, Leavey Library is getting more and more crowded each night and flashcards are a common accessory in the Campus Center.
But before we finalize our study schedules, college students should plan on committing one more term to memory: FERPA.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, colloquially known as FERPA, is the academic version of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or what we know as HIPAA. It is our confidentiality contract with our higher education institution. Through this act, USC is legally obligated to guard our education records from prying eyes and to defer any inquiries about academic records directly to the student.
TL;DR: FERPA says USC puts the student as the chief executive of his or her private academic information. It’s supremely important for us to finally shed the image of the lazy millennial.
The legislation has been around for more than 40 years, about a decade before Generation Y even hit the scene. FERPA lasts even after our college careers end, so it’s likely that most of our parents are also covered by the act.
A recent Los Angeles Times article claimed “college students have too much privacy.” To prove their point, they included a horror story about how a parent was kept in the dark for years about their child not actually graduating.
This is not a once-in-a-lifetime story, USC’s Associate Registrar Bob Morley told me. In his 30 years in academia, he has encountered a handful of parents who didn’t know about their kids’ academic struggles. Since FERPA’s enactment, parents have lobbied Congress to loosen its restrictions on guarding their child’s records from them.
Poor parents, right? FERPA’s motto should be: “Don’t ask, because I can’t even tell you.”
FERPA even carries weight overseas. Therefore, when I was abroad last semester, I could have not shown up to a single class and still my parents would not have been notified. Granted, I would have probably had to answer to other pressures, such as my GPA.
Gordon Stables, associate dean of student affairs at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, acknowledged that it’s “sometimes hard for family members to hear” that they have to ask their children to grant them access to their records. Especially if they’re footing the bill for this world-class education.
But millennials need FERPA more than ever right now. We already get a bad rap for not doing enough for ourselves. The term helicopter parents and “ME” generation comes to mind when thinking of ways millennials are hyper-dependent.
“How students and parents negotiate that is something that I wish we had a better handle on,” Morley said. “One of the things I see with millennials is that they are so connected with their parents I can’t believe it. So there’s an ongoing really good communication, several times a day sometimes, but sometimes there’s a disconnect for important things like, ‘How are you doing in school?’”
And it makes sense. We’re flooded with so much information. Sometimes it’s easier for our parents to do for us what we feel like we don’t have time to do for ourselves.
Part of it is that, unlike your Twitter timeline or a Sparknotes summary, FERPA at its surface does not seem quickly consumable. The act has grown so many branches that the childhood game “20 Questions” is needed to decipher its reach.
I’m not even joking. On the Office of Academic Records and Registrar, there’s a FERPA tutorial modeled after “20 Questions.”
“There’s still so much confusion,” Stables said. “In some way with the greater access of information today and the ability for us to look at your STARS report in real time on our phones, it’s becoming increasingly important to educate someone on the security of their records.”
This generation needs FERPA to depend less on technology and our guardians and become the main executors of our academic careers. The federal government’s laws reflect its faith in our ability to do for ourselves.
“It’s the student who is the individual that makes the decision to attend the university,” Stables said. “It defines the relationship between the student and school. It’s the student earning the grades, and it’s the student’s whose privacy is in the record.”
With this power, we need to exercise great responsibility.
That means learning the full extent of the act. FERPA shows that those in power still believe in us millennials to do for ourselves. Let’s not prove them wrong.

Dear Tiffany, 
I am an active followers of all things Kardashian — Twitter, Snapchat, mobile gaming and occasional merchandise purchases. Does this guilty pleasure need to carry such a harsh social stigma? Can a person indulge in celebrity worship and still feel like a decent person with integrity?
I know many intellectual, socially conscious people who also happen to enjoy some outwardly lowbrow reality TV. If spending your time musing about the Kardashians provides you joy or some kind of outlet for your stress, don’t deny yourself.
The term “celebrity worship,” however, does raise some red flags. While you sound self-aware, don’t fall into obsessive territory. You owe yourself better role models to obsess over. 
 
Dear Tiffany, 
I love dogs. I want a dog but I can’t have one because of my building. Help. 
If you really feel passionate about loving on dogs, I highly recommend volunteering at an animal shelter. Westside German Shepherd Rescue is a no-kill shelter just minutes from USC, and they are always looking for volunteers.
If you move into a new place that allows pets in the future, I encourage you to think critically about the responsibilities of pet ownership, which often last more than a decade. Dogs, and other animals, thrive in loving, comfortable and familiar living situations. I hope that as a dog lover, you can practice patience and not adopt (please adopt!) until you are capable of providing the long-term type of love a dog deserves.  
 
Dear Tiffany, 
How do you make a good cup of cold brew iced coffee?
You don’t. You mosey over to Ground Zero Performance Cafe and get yourself a big cup of the most affordable cold brew in South Central, which also happens to be organic, fair trade and sustainably sourced!

Let’s be honest, California isn’t exactly known for its public transportation. However, the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner, which runs oceanside for 350 miles, finds a way to make the journey enjoyable. The train serves all of Southern California, with a total of 27 stops in convenient locations such as Irvine, Simi Valley and Santa Barbara. It’s one of the most practical ways to get home if you’re from anywhere between San Diego and my hometown of San Luis Obispo. But, most students seem to forget about Amtrak, and after being inundated with L.A.’s car-culture, the idea of taking a train can come to sound bizarre. 
In fact, when my parents first suggested that I take the train home rather than drive to San Luis Obispo, I almost laughed out loud. Instead of taking me four hours, it was going to take me at least seven. Instead of being able to stop wherever I wanted — and by that I mean making a Sprinkles run — I was going to have to make do with what I was sure would be some repulsive prepackaged-meal from the train cafe. However, because arguing with my mother is a pointless endeavor, I grudgingly packed my suitcase and downloaded an entire season of “One Tree Hill,” positive that I was going to be bored out of my mind. Instead I spent the whole trip gazing out of the window, laptop untouched, as the coastline that I thought I knew so well whizzed by me in a form that I had never seen before, or perhaps just never taken the time to appreciate. 
The sunset was the shade of sherbet-orange reserved in my mind for the photoshopped calendars of exotic locales that hang in cramped office buildings. Never once had I seen such a perfect manifestation of the “California dream.” The palm trees were tall, dark shadows against the sky, and the waves leisurely rolled out from behind them. With the gorgeous view, it was easy to forget that I wasn’t a surfer-girl lying out on the beach with sand squishing between my toes and the scent of sunscreen on my skin. Instead, I was sitting with my nose pressed up against the glass in the air-conditioned comfort of an Amtrak train. 
If you get a chance, whether you’re going home or just looking for a weekend getaway with your friends, the Amtrak is an amazing way to start your trip off right. Rather than spending the entire ride staring at a computer screen or with your head in a textbook, take some time to just sit by the window and watch the coastline pass by. The view is beautiful, and after a long week of studying, extracurriculars and social obligations, there is a Zen-like feeling to spending a few hours doing nothing but taking in all the scenery. Getting to the station is free and convenient, with USC buses leaving from the JEP House for Union Station every half an hour, Monday-Friday. Once you’re there, the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner can take you to your final destination. 
When the conductor announced that we’d almost reached our last stop, I glanced at my phone and laughed.
11:15 p.m.

Although taking the train might not be the most efficient way to travel, I honestly can’t think of a more relaxing way to have started my weekend. If you ever feel like you need a moment to just hit pause, ditch the freeway traffic and buy yourself an Amtrak ticket. Trust me, California has never looked more beautiful than it does on that picturesque stretch of railroad track. 
When my kids were little, we used to take the train one stop from the San Juan Capistrano Mission to the San Clemente Pier. They loved it.

Pramuka Island is one of the beautiful sites to see in the Thousand Islands Archipelago in Indonesia. Christina Nursalim | Daily Trojan.
With recruiting season now in full swing, USC students are clamoring to land internships for the school year and jobs for after graduation. However, it’s not too early to begin thinking about summer employment as well. Some of you may know that USC offers opportunities for students to study and intern abroad. Students have an array of countries to pick from, and each has different cultures and traditions. With so many options to choose from, one country that people often overlook is my home country, Indonesia. I have lived in Indonesia for all my life, so I’m here to give you the top four reasons why you should consider my nation as your next internship (or, perhaps, vacation) destination. If you are a Marshall student, check out the Marshall International Summer Internship Program, which gives students the opportunity to secure a two-month, in-depth, internship experience in Indonesia’s capital city, Jakarta.
1. Make business connections and be inspired.
When I tell my friends at USC that I am from Indonesia, I am often met with some kind of awe and trepidation. Some of them picture Indonesia as a third-world developing country with nothing but forests and poverty (I was once asked if Indonesia has a Starbucks – and the answer to that is yes). While Indonesia is a developing country, and poverty is definitely still a major issue, parts of Indonesia are actually quite developed. There are many upscale shopping malls and, of course, office buildings. You may be surprised to know that Indonesia has over 1,500 Trojans whom have all made names for themselves. Indonesia has seen the emergence of many start-ups and many of the Trojans in Indonesia are self-made men and women. I guarantee that learning from the huge Trojan network and hearing about their experiences will inspire you and give you a valuable internship experience.
2. Food
If you have never tried Indonesian food before, you are in for a treat. Indonesian food is known for its spices and aromatics, which results in food bursting with flavor. Indonesia’s delectable desserts are also worth mentioning. Be sure to try Martabak, arguably the most popular street dessert there. It is a type of sweet, thick pancake stuffed with fillings like Nutella and pandan, a tropical plant indigenous to Southeast Asia and that gives a sweet, fragrant and unique flavor when cooked with. My favorite Martabak flavor is the pandan and cheese filling from Martabak Boss.
3. Nature
Let’s admit it, one of the reasons you picked USC is probably because of the sunny weather and proximity to beaches. You’ve probably heard of Bali, Indonesia’s most famous tourist attraction, but Indonesia actually has over a hundred other islands that you can travel to. These islands feature crystal clear waters and beautiful, untouched beaches. They are all just a boat ride away, which makes a perfect weekend getaway during your stay there. Who needs the Maldives when you can get the same beauty at a much more affordable price? Another important note: the Indonesian currency, the Rupiah, is currently very weak, which gives students more bang for their buck when traveling to see these sites.
4. Culture
Get the chance to experience Indonesia’s rich culture and long-standing traditions. Traveling through the streets of Jakarta, you can often see people making beautiful hand-drawn batiks (clothes dyed by using traditional Indonesian methods and designs) or playing traditional instruments such as the Angklung or Gamelan. You could also watch a traditional dance like the Minangkabau dance (plate dance) or a Balinese shadow puppet show known as Wayang Kulit.
Studying and interning abroad is probably something many students have thought about. It’s also something that students hold both excitement and fear for. However, I do believe that it is an amazing opportunity for students to expand their horizons, expose themselves to a different experience and gain independence. So, the next time you are thinking of taking the plunge and interning or traveling abroad, think about Indonesia.
