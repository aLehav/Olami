The USC beach volleyball team is no stranger to winning.
After going 34-2 overall and finishing last season on a 30-match winning streak to capture the sport’s first-ever NCAA championship title, the Trojans’ golden success on the sand has transferred over seamlessly into their 2017 campaign.
The top-ranked Trojans currently own an unblemished 25-0 record this season and have since extended their program-record win streak to a remarkable 55 consecutive matches, with wins in 87 of their last 89 duals. In fact, USC hasn’t lost a match in nearly 400 days, dating all the way back to March 11, 2016.
With a streak of that magnitude, you might expect there to be some added pressure to remain “perfect.”
For the Trojans and head coach Anna Collier, however, the focus is not on the streak, but rather on playing good, high-quality beach volleyball every time they step out on the court — a style of play that Collier simply brands as “USC volleyball.”
“We try not to focus on those winning streaks because we’ve obviously been down that road before,” Collier said. “Last season was last season, and after winning back-to-back national championships, the target is definitely on our backs. But what we’re just trying to do is play the best volleyball we can, and if we can do that, then the byproduct will be that three-peat.”
And this year’s new-look Trojans are certainly poised to make another big run in the postseason. In addition to Collier, who is the first and only collegiate beach volleyball coach to reach 100 career victories with a 133-17 overall record (.886), USC has relied on a roster filled with experienced upperclassmen to lead the way.
Perhaps the most impressive feat this year, however, has been the fact that the Trojans have maintained that success even with shuffled pairs and multiple injuries.
The current lineup is comprised of five seniors, three juniors, a sophomore and a freshman. All but one of those five pairs had played together before the start the season, though, as the No. 2, 3, 4 and 5 pairs were all newly formed this year. 
And yet, with about half of the regular season completed, all four of those new pairs have already reached double-digit wins despite battling multiple injuries on each court. 
The one constant for USC has been at the top court, where seniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes have steamrolled over their competition. The All-Americans and the winningest pair in NCAA history have played together since the beginning of the 2015 season and have since compiled a 122-4 all-time record (.968). 
They also had a nice streak of their own, winning an incredible 103-consecutive matches dating back to April 2, 2015. 
It’s this type of consistency and big-time play from top to bottom that has helped position the Trojans well for a chance to win their third consecutive national title this spring. 
Claes acknowledged that the depth of her team and their willingness to compete and win has been a big factor to USC’s success this season.
“We all knew coming into the year that every single team would be gunning for us,” Claes said. “But that was something we all really embraced. Every team we face is going to be playing their best against us no matter what, and we’re up to that challenge and ready to prove why we’re the best team in the nation.”
In retrospect, the last four years of the collegiate beach volleyball scene have been dominated by USC and its senior class. Claes, Hughes, Sophie Bukovec, Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler — all starters since the day they arrived on campus — own a combined record of 110-5 overall for an impressive .957 career winning percentage. 
With about a month left in the season, though, Hughes and the rest of the Trojans are eager and ready to defend their title in the upcoming tournament.
“Staying on top is definitely the mantra this year,” Hughes said. “There were so many amazing firsts last season, like winning Pac-12s and NCAAs, and the streak has been pretty cool too. But while we’re really proud of what we accomplished, this season we have to work even harder to win them again. The ultimate goal has always been to win a national championship at the end of the season. We know it’s not going to be easy, but we’re ready to fight and we want to go out with a bang.”

On Sunday, Las Vegas dubbed redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold the preseason Heisman Trophy favorite, with USC’s signal caller opening as a 5-1 frontrunner at multiple sportsbooks.
The announcement surprised few, especially around the campus that Darnold captivated last fall. Darnold had been the Heisman favorite for months on online betting sites (alas, I missed my chance to place a wager on him when he was a 9-1 underdog behind Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield), and he simply never seemed to share the field with any quarterback of his caliber during his debut campaign. Why wouldn’t he be the favorite — and perhaps a heavy one at that?
But pressure obviously comes with the spotlight, and more often than not, it’s actually a bad omen to open as the odds-on Heisman frontrunner. Remember Leonard Fournette’s 2016 season? Or Trevonne Boykin’s 2015 campaign? Me neither.
This is usually the moment I like to engage my sports-fan defense mechanism and become a relentless pessimist — you can’t disappoint me if I set the bar low enough. Instinctively, I want to remind everyone about 2012, when preseason No. 1 USC and Heisman favorite Matt Barkley were touted to win it all before finishing unranked at 7-6 in a reeking dumpster fire of a season. I want to scream that high expectations haven’t done any good for the Trojans in recent years and that the hype is setting a stacked squad up for failure.
But I can’t do that for this year’s team (next year’s?) without feeling like a hypocrite. No matter how hard I try to brace myself for disappointment, I can’t help being pumped for the fall. I don’t want to jinx the Trojans (I probably just did), but they feel invincible. 
Ever since Darnold made his home debut against Arizona State last October, USC has looked like the best team in the nation — and the Trojans proved it in their miraculous Rose Bowl victory over No. 5 Penn State, who had beaten the likes of Ohio State and Wisconsin during the regular season.
More importantly, however, nothing ever seemed to get to Darnold last season. Nothing. And that is a trend that must continue if he is to win the Heisman and lead the Trojans to glory next year. Darnold lost his first career start at Utah but bounced back immediately, pummeling the Sun Devils one week later. 
He delivered an upset win in Seattle over No. 4 Washington and followed that up with rivalry wins over UCLA and Notre Dame. Then he led the Rose Bowl comeback.
All the while, Darnold remained unfathomably unflappable. Whether he suffered a strip-sack or completed a 50-yard bomb, the reaction was the same: jog over to the sidelines to talk it over with head coach Clay Helton — mixing in a few high-fives after the positive plays. Throw a pick? Jog to the sidelines. Touchdown? Jog to the sidelines. Complete a pass left-handed and between-the-legs while rolling out against the grain? Jog to the sidelines (probably).
My limited interactions with Darnold haven’t suggested anything different. He exudes a love for football throughout conversation, but in a way, he also appears more excited about playing pickup basketball with his teammates during the offseason. 
When my co-editor Julia Poe was fortunate enough to share a meal with the Darnold family last month, she saw what the Trojan quarterback has been since childhood: a natural-born athlete who just wants to have fun with the ball in his hands, whether it’s on the court or the gridiron on Saturdays.
That is what makes me so confident about the coming season. How can Darnold buckle under pressure when he looks completely oblivious to it in the first place? Even as his celebrity grows, he has shown no signs of becoming weary of the media scrutiny, nor is he basking in it. 
He remains soft-spoken and even-keel, despite being touted as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft as a teenager. Very few young players in Darnold’s circumstances have been able to avoid the pitfalls of superstardom, especially in a city like Los Angeles that is so focused on the creation of celebrities. 
Yet he has. Perhaps that is the final piece that will finally allow the Trojans to rise to high expectations after the dark days of the post-Pete Carroll era.
It may seem silly to derive so much hope from intangibles — especially since USC’s glory years under Carroll came with Hollywood glitz and glamour. But we’ve seen plenty of very tangible talents on campus, from Leonard Williams to Adoree’ Jackson, and plenty of personality, be it in coaches such as Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian or in players like JuJu Smith-Schuster. While exciting at times, all of those people departed the program without the ultimate currency in Trojan lore: a national championship. Darnold certainly has the talent, but it may be his borderline-bizarre understatedness that ultimately puts him above other Trojan legends of the past.
All of this is to say: If there is one player who can overcome the jinx of being preseason Heisman favorite, it’s Darnold. In addition to his unquestionable talent (which all Heisman contenders possess), Darnold has also shown the humility and focus you rarely see from an anonymous college freshman turned national sensation. He could very well add the Heisman to his decorated trophy cabinet next December — and he may add a National Championship a few weeks after that.
You probably won’t hear him say anything about it, though.

The men’s tennis team returns to its home courts this week to host two of their final three matches of the season. With their No. 6 ranking under their belts, the Trojans will first take on Arizona (9-13, 0-4) on Friday and Utah (15-7, 1-3) on Saturday.
Arizona has yet to notch a conference win this season, taking losses to both Washington and Oregon. None of the Wildcats are ranked in singles and doubles, and the Trojans have only lost two matches to them since 1932. With three matches left in conference play, Friday’s matchups should give the Trojans an opportunity to notch an important victory.
Utah have also faced struggles this season, finding their only conference victory of the year in a 4-2 win over Washington last week. Similarly, the Utes do not have any ranked players in singles or doubles, providing the Trojans with a solid chance to add another match to their win column.
So far this season, the Trojans have only built on their original ranking of No. 10, climbing closer this week to the nation’s top five. This week’s individual rankings also place two Trojans in the top rankings for singles along with three doubles teams. Freshman Brandon Holt sits at the top for the team with a No. 23 national ranking for singles, while sophomore Logan Smith follows at No. 72. In doubles, Holt and fellow freshman Riley Smith are ranked No. 11, while senior Nick Crystal and sophomore Laurens Verboven sit at No. 76. Junior Thibault Forget and sophomore Logan Smith follow close behind at No. 80.
Head coach Peter Smith is looking to extend his career wins after recording his 600th at the end of march. The Trojans took down No. 23 Oregon to clinch the victory and hauled in a win against Cal and Stanford last week. Smith has already brought five national championships to the Trojans, and in his 15th season, he is continuing to make an impact in the program.
The next challenge for Smith’s team will be to close out the regular season in order to secure a top seed for the Pac-12 championships. After that, the Trojans will turn their attention toward the national playoffs and another trip to the title match.

Following two road wins against Oregon and San Diego State, the Trojans are set to take on sixth-ranked Colorado on Friday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
With an overall 11-3 record, (5-0 MPSF) the Trojans dominated their competition in last week’s contests, highlighted by a commanding offensive performance by senior attacker Michaela Michael. On the road, Michael matched her career high of seven goals in addition to six draw controls against San Diego State and six goals and 11 draw controls against Oregon. Following a solid week, she also earned her 10th career MPSF Player of the Week Award. Michael has anchored the Trojan offense throughout her senior season scoring at least four goals in eight of USC’s last nine games. 
Senior Cynthia Del Core has also been an instrumental component of the Trojan offense, recording her 11th career hat trick and three assists in Friday’s contest against the Ducks. In addition, freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller had a strong performance over the weekend, demonstrating her offensive skill with three goals and her fifth career hat trick against San Diego State. 
With a five-game winning streak, the Trojans are gearing up to take on the Buffs this coming Friday and continue their winning ways. Colorado’s roster is highlighted by junior midfielder Darby Kiernan, top scorer on the team, who earned Player of the Week honors last week following her strong performance against Stanford. On defense, the Buffs are second in the nation in overall defense with senior goalie Paige Soenksen in the net. With a 12-1 overall record, the Buffs remain undefeated in conference play. 
Miller highlights the Trojan mindset of using each competition as an opportunity to improve. 
“What we’ve said from the beginning of the season is that we want to get better each and every game so we’re looking at Friday as another opportunity to get better -— defensively and offensively,” Miller said. 
With both teams exhibiting a strong defensive unit, the name of the game will be capitalizing on opportunities. 
“They’re a really disciplined team,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “They play as a unit really well and have a great goalie so we’re going to have to play really disciplined on offense and make the most of the opportunities that we have and make sure to finish our shots when we do get them.”
Friday’s game also holds significance as it is Senior Night for the Trojans. 
“I think it’s going to be a really special night,” Munday said. “This group has been with us really from the beginning and has been with us through the ups of the program and the downs of the program and have stuck through and have now stepped into this leadership role really well and really made this team their own.” 
In her first season at USC, Miller spoke about the senior leadership and the importance of team chemistry. 
“Coming in as a freshman the seniors totally took us under their wing, showed us the ropes and set the standard of what the season should be,” Miller said. “Team camaraderie is the biggest thing that we can do to have success — being with the team and having trust in your teammates is what will make us ultimately the most successful.” 
With a strong team chemistry, the Trojans look to continue their five-game winning streak by working together as a unit, come Friday. 
“The games that we’ve had so far this season have prepared us for the game on Friday,” Munday said. “We’ve gone through a lot of different situations in games —we’ve been up, we’ve been down, we’ve lost, we’ve beat teams.We’re going to have to be ready to play a full 60-minute game and battle all across the field in order to compete.”

Sophomore Armaan Premjee, who was arrested on Tuesday on charges of sexual assault, remains at USC, but is no longer a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity.
Los Angeles Police Department officers arrested Premjee at 11 a.m. on Tuesday. He was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center until he posted $100,000 bail at 7:53 p.m.
The alleged sexual assault took place at  Fluor Tower residence hall around 1 a.m. on April 1, according to Department of Public Safety logs. 
University officials could not provide details about who reported the incident. Information about the victim was not made public.
Premjee, who is majoring in business administration, said that he was detained that same day at the Kappa Sigma fraternity house and was then taken to the Southwest LAPD Office, where he was questioned and later released.
Premjee said he could not discuss specifics about the case due to legal reasons. Robinder Samudrala, his attorney, declined repeated requests for comment.
Premjee said that he wrote a letter of resignation to the president of the Kappa Sigma fraternity prior to his arrest.
“I know incidents like these get fraternities kicked out,” Premjee said.  “I didn’t want to put the brothers at risk.”
Kappa Sigma President Evan Lubin said that Premjee was suspended from the fraternity following the original incident on April 1.
“His actions are absolutely not condoned by the Kappa Sigma Fraternity,” Lubin wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Premjee has been charged with a felony, according to LAPD Public Information Officer Tony Im. LAPD Detective Oscar Gamino confirmed that the first preliminary court date regarding the case is set for May 2, and that LAPD still needs to hear from witnesses. LAPD could not comment on the statement or the victim.
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that DPS protocol requires officers to immediately notify LAPD upon receiving any reports of sexual assault. DPS cedes all authority to conduct the investigation to LAPD, providing assistance upon request, Carlisle said.
“Once the sexual assault is reported to us, we must notify the LAPD,” Carlisle said. “We would also concurrently notify [the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services] and the Office of Title IX so that resources to support the victim are provided. Our primary concern is the safety and well-being of the student. LAPD handles the criminal investigation part.”
Premjee said that representatives of the Title IX office at USC have contacted him and would be “glad to help out” if he had trouble navigating the current situation. He added that he has not met with the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and has not been suspended.
“I have faith in our justice system, and I hope to be free of these charges very soon,” Premjee said.
The Office of Equity and Diversity, Residential Education Office and RSVP were unable to be reached at time of publication.

It almost feels like a personal betrayal when an artist does something out of character. You think you have come to know them, their quirks and the style of music, but then they do something completely foreign to their personality.
Take Drake for example. He recently dropped More Life, a “playlist” that broke streaming records on Apple Music. But just last year, Drake was criticized for his diss on Kid Cudi’s mental health. Although Drake’s actions are disappointing, it wasn’t completely out of character. 
The biggest example of a personality shift is about someone I love to bag on: Taylor Swift. For years, her music was that of a typical country artist. She sang about boys, love and the simple things in life. When she started to gain fans from the pop realm, her music changed into mainstream sound, and she dropped the Southern twang she used to sing with.
A surprisingly extensive Buzzfeed article detailed the trajectory of Swift’s rebranding as a feminist who is often on the unfortunate end of one bad relationship too many. This all came to a climax when it was revealed in a glorious Snapchat exposé that she lied about not knowing about the Kanye West lyrics that claim he made her famous, when in reality she heard the line from West before the song was even released.
While it may be shocking to some, this isn’t out of the ordinary. Swift plays victim in her music solely to sell records, and it’s not reflective of who she actually is as a person. She’s not anyone I’d want to be friends with -— that’s for sure. Even still, I’ll gladly listen to her music because she’s a great pop artist. I’m still going to blast “22” on my birthday, and I’ll still know the lyrics to “You Belong With Me” on my deathbed.
Even though she’s as fake as they come, she’s still going to sell records because at the end of the day, she’s really good at her job. And that’s what a lot of these artists who seem “fake” are doing: their job. There’s an endless debate of whether or not an artist sells out when they stop putting their personal life in their music and just start doing conventional things to sell music, but every artist has to have some type of personality in their music.
While artists could start out as people who wear their hearts on their sleeves when they make music, it’s likely that they could alter their public images in order to appeal to a wider audience to sell more records or because they feel like they need to change who they are as artists. However, some people don’t understand this concept and don’t accept change easily. 
When Beyoncé’s Lemonade came out, she shook the foundation of her fan base. She not only raised the idea of her seemingly faithful husband, Jay-Z, stepping outside of their marriage (which isn’t true, if we’re keeping record), but she also embraced her blackness in a way that caused a lot of her fans to panic. They weren’t comfortable with Beyoncé being… well, a black artist. But nearly anyone with eyes can see that Beyoncé has always been a black artist, and that’s probably not going to change in the future. 
The backlash was so ridiculous it was comical, and Saturday Night Live took advantage of it by making a skit that parodies some of her fans freaking out over something that shouldn’t have been a problem in the first place. 
Even still, people took Beyoncé’s change a little too seriously because they thought that someone they personally knew had done something to spite them. First of all, this isn’t true, since chances are, you don’t know Beyoncé like that. Secondly, it is ironic, since we do it all the time. 
Do you act the same way at work as you do at home? OK, for those of you who work in super rad places like Facebook, maybe so, but my point is that we edit and shape ourselves to adapt to our situation. The “you” that is super cheerful and enthusiastic about everything at work might not be the same “you” that goes home every night and eats a tub of Ben & Jerry’s by yourself in sweats.
I know that I’m not the same when I write this column as I am in person. I put just enough of my personality in this column to be different from others and have a unique voice because that’s my job. Similarly, your favorite artist is putting enough of their personality in the record to be unique, and they could be completely different as a person.
Putting your favorite artist on a pedestal only sets you up for disappointment when they will inevitably let you down somehow. The artist and the person who invented that artist are two different people, and at the end of the day, that’s who artists really are: people, like you and me.

What is home? Is it a place, person or mentality? Argineh Zadoorian, a senior majoring in art, invited viewers to ask this question in her latest exhibit It Feels Like Home.
The Macomber Travel Grant, which is awarded to undergraduate Roski students to do research-based travel and create new art, allowed Zadoorian to travel to Armenia. During her trip, she conducted surveys with international students about the process of assimilation and finding a home. After speaking to  international students in both Armenia and at USC, Zadoorian found the inspiration she needed to create her exhibit.
One example of such inspiration can be found in her abstract paintings. The paintings are an array of images in which texts from various surveys are written and mixed with varying color palettes. 
Zadoorian’s attention to detail is remarkable — the use of handwritten text resembles not only the intimacy of using a personal diary, but also the discomfort that comes with revealing personal details. Furthermore, her use of color, such as the bold blue that was popular in her hometown  and the Persian characters, reflect the complexity of each person’s experience and identity.
“The kind of handwriting that I use is intentional; it’s not my handwriting,” Zadoorian said. “It’s the handwriting that I’m not comfortable with, and the reason behind it is that I wanted to place myself in their position, being the other, while looking at other people’s stories.”
 Zadoorian comes from a mixed background herself. As an Iranian Armenian woman creating art in America, Zadoorian has discovered her own sense of identity through the power of art. Her identity as Armenian, refugee and artist is printed in bold Helvetica letters against a colorful background of paint strokes. Hidden beneath the strokes are visual manifestations of her heritage — Persian rugs, dried fruits and a photo of herself holding traditional Armenian bread.
“Coming from a different culture background, having all these nationalities and being an artist helps me to be able to express myself and to bring whatever I have from my past to my present,” Zadoorian said. “If I was doing something else I’m unsure if I would be comfortable doing that.”
The exhibit is a conglomeration of different art mediums, such as video and carpentry, which play off the idea that every person has many different identities. Notable works stemming from that concept include two videos projected on the east and west walls.
One shows Zadoorian’s past, present and future. The wall shows the overflow of emotions individuals have when reconnecting with their past and conjuring memories, as well as the journeys they take in the hope of coming to terms with past and present identities.
This recognition of heritage is also exemplified in the other video and accompanying trinket box on display — in the video, the viewer goes inside a carved box in which Zadoorian’s heritage is represented by her personal possessions. From the Persian rug to the eyeliner worn in her hometown to woven dolls, Zadoorian reminds us that home is not a place, but the things we carry around with us that shape our identity.
At the end of an array of paintings is a self-portrait. The painting, however, does not capture Zadoorian’s personal experience with identity — instead, it represents of all the individuals Zadoorian surveyed and their feelings of assimilation and alienation. In it, Zadoorian is shown with a face of confusion and disappointment, symbolic of the expressions her peers had told her when they were asked by others about their feeling of belonging in their current communities.
“I would get their impression of when they feel like they are assimilated in an environment or when they feel like they are the other,” Zadoorian said when conducting the survey. “This [self-portrait] is the look that I usually get from people [about assimilation], and I am just trying to give it back to them, the viewer.”

In the crazy world of food mashups, dishes such as Nutella pizza and bulgogi tacos have gained major traction on social media foodies. Southern California has become a hub for novel culinary trends, with milky buns — ice cream donut sandwiches — from After’s Ice Cream to sushi donuts from Project Poke. But has anyone tried a pizza burger yet? 
Meathead! can offer that experience. Located on Main and 7th Streets, this new downtown eatery boasts an impressive and refined menu that features burgers, breakfast burritos, bowls and fries. While Meathead! offers a mix between Eastern and Western flavors with quirky items such as the Kim Park Lee burger, its specialty is the Meatzza — an option that turns any burger of your choosing into a pizza burger. 
The little shack was bustling with customers waiting for their order. Outside, three tables were accompanied by some chairs, benches and sun umbrellas. Upon entry into the shack, customers were greeted by Meathead!’s handwritten menu on a whiteboard. A little metallic bar with stools underneath the menu offered seating for about four to five people. On the left, customers made their orders through a small window. 
Meathead! features a menu that changes daily depending on its offerings. However, five different types of burgers ranging between $7.50 and $9.50 are consistently on the menu: the Meathead!, the Eastern, the Kim Park Lee, the Beef! Beef! and the Yakuza. On the fries menu, the stand offers the Notorious P.I.G. and the Killa Kam fries — one with a Hispanic influence, the other Korean. 
The Meatzza option — Meathead!’s signature concept — can be applied to any of the burgers upon request for $3. To further elaborate, the Meatzza magically transforms an average burger into a pizza burger by inverting the bun. After it’s flattened, the bun is doused in tomato sauce and melted cheese, topped with mini pepperoni slices and placed on top of your burger of choice.
The Yakuza burger used chicken katsu strips as its patty instead of ground beef. In addition, the Yakuza was packed with applewood bacon, a fried egg, white onion, green cabbage slaw and a tonkatsu spread. With all its components, the Yakuza was a clever mix of ingredients that almost cohesively mixed the East and West together. However, the chicken katsu was slightly overcooked. In addition, instead of a fully cooked egg, a sunny side up egg with a runny yolk would have enhanced the moisture of the burger. What redeemed the burger overall was its tonkatsu sauce, due to its tangy Japanese barbeque flavor. 
The next item was the Killa Kam fries, which could have been their own full meal. The thin fries were drizzled with a thick pink jalapeño cheese and loaded with kimchi slaw, pickled jalapeño, green and white onions, toasted sesame and slices of bulgogi beef. Every component of the dish worked well together, but made it also very filling. Meathead! could have been a bit more liberal with the amount of bulgogi on the fries, but the slices of brisket were still flavorful without being overbearing. The golden crisp on the fries and jalapeño cheese, in the end, were the main stars of the dish, adding bursts of flavor to every bite.
Finally, the Meathead! burger, the namesake of the eatery, is a must-try item — especially with the Meatzza option. Topped by a bun that almost resembled a pizza bagel, the sandwich was made to perfection. Caramelized onions, dill pickles and lettuce complemented the flavors well, but there were four components that added a dynamic twist to the burger. Though it was cooked medium-well, the ground angus beef remained tender and juicy. 
Moreover, the Meathead! sauce and smashed and roasted tomato gave the burger a refreshing, tangy taste. Despite having the potential to overwhelm, the Meatzza bun did not disappoint. Surprisingly, the entire burger — with its many different components — was cohesive, and all the flavors harmonized into one piece of meaty perfection. 
Meathead! is not for the faint of heart. With an outrageous menu that features a wide mix of ingredients, the eatery will be an experience for any meat lover out there. And in just a bit of time, the Meatzza — or the pizza burger — is bound to take over the next cycle of Southern California food trends.

L.A. nightclubs and bars may soon be able to stay open later into the night if the Let Our Communities Adjust Late Night Act, or LOCAL, is signed into state law. This bill would remove the statewide restriction on alcohol being served past 2 a.m. and instead push the curfew to 4 a.m. Proponents argue that the current restrictions are outdated and unnecessary, pointing to cities such as New York City and Chicago that allow alcohol to be served around the clock, and protect the city’s young people.
From a financial standpoint, the bill appears to be a no-brainer. It can create jobs and businesses for communities while generating tax dollars from additional alcohol sales. But that being said, lawmakers also have a responsibility to have a serious conversation about how this bill will impact public safety. Supporters argue that this bill will create safer nighttime entertainment options in the L.A. area by making it easier for clubs to make enough money that they don’t have to operate illegally and without regulation. However, scholarship does not support this position. Instead, research by both the World Health Organization and the American Journal of Preventative Medicine shows that similar extensions of drinking hours have led to increased alcohol-related emergency room visits, drunk-driving cases and assaults. 
It’s no wonder that law enforcement and neighborhood groups oppose the bill. While advocates of the bill assert that services such as public transit and Uber diminish the danger of drunk driving, this “Uber effect” remains untested. And there is still nothing in place to prevent expected increases in assaults and alcohol-related injuries if drinking hours are extended. 
As currently written, the bill would not require cities to push their serving time back to 4 a.m. Instead, they would have the option to set closing time so long as it is not past 4 a.m. At first, this stipulation appears to make sense. It allows each city to assess its resources to ensure that the change can be made safely. However, in practice, this provision could attract more people from surrounding towns into large cities because of a later closing time. 
This effect has been observed in border cities such as Detroit. When neighboring Ontario, Canada provinces stopped selling alcohol an hour before the bars in Detroit, partygoers from Ontario would drive across the border to go to Detroit bars and nightclubs, which had later closing times. This case demonstrates that, if LOCAL passes in California, cities with later closing times will draw people from surrounding areas. The distance will make it prohibitively expensive for these people to Uber to and from the city with a later closing time, making it exponentially more likely they will drive under the influence.
Studies have shown that one of the most effective ways to reduce the harms of alcohol is to limit the times when alcohol is available for purchase. LOCAL favors projected economic gains over the well-being of affected Californians. To make matters worse, the politicians and business groups supporting this bill have used extreme examples, such as the fire last year at an illegal nightclub in Oakland that killed 36 people, to argue that this bill will make California communities safer. 
LOCAL is a trade-off between public safety and business growth. There is little evidence to support an assertion that allowing bars and nightclubs to serve alcohol only until 4 a.m. will hurt local economies and even less evidence to support a claim that pushing back the last call will make cities safer.

Last week, a Northwestern Law School professor and a student released some unsurprising research about interruptions among Supreme Court justices through the years. “Even though female justices speak less often and use fewer words than male justices, they are nonetheless interrupted during oral argument at a significantly higher rate,” the study read. 
To be precise, in 1990 when Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was the only woman in the court, 35.7 percent of interruptions directed at all nine justices were directed specifically at her. In 2002, 45.3 percent of interruptions were directed at the court’s two female justices, and in 2015, 65.9 percent of all interruptions were directed at the court’s three females.
So, yes, progress is being made — we’re seeing more women join the Supreme Court, more women representing women and shaping and interpreting the law where crucial women’s issues such as reproductive rights are concerned. But they’re being talked over far more often than their male counterparts, by their male counterparts. This is reflective of an overarching problem: the dismissive treatment women inherently face, no matter what they’ve earned and achieved. 
The phenomenon of women being interrupted, talked over and sidelined from dialogues in classrooms, workplaces and frankly, everywhere, is well-documented. The Harvard Business Review and other respected research institutions have all reported similar findings.
A core American expectation is that all it takes is hard work to earn power and respect. But no matter what boundaries we break, no matter how many glass ceilings we crack, women will constantly face treatment and attitudes — subtle or overt — that tell us that this is a man’s world still, and we belong in the kitchen.
On a macro level, the 2016 presidential election is a painful and cringe-inducing example to cite, and while the results of the election speak to a variety of cultural and identity-based national phenomena beyond gender, one heartbreaking message it seemed to elicit is that when you’re a woman, you can do everything right — in this context, devote your life to public service — and lose to a man who would have accomplished nothing had his father not left him more than $5 million, a man with a slew of sexual assault accusations against him who is on the record gleefully uttering the words “grab ‘em by the p-ssy.”
On a micro level, my everyday experiences closely reflect this trend as well. I have published numerous articles about the election, politics and women’s rights issues for multiple publications, and worked as a news and politics intern and writer for these publications. However, I find that whenever my conversations about national politics and yes, even women’s issues, include male peers, my perspective is quickly cast aside. 
I can even recall one particularly frustrating experience during which a male peer belittled my decision to study journalism and political science at USC — after years of editorial experience — as the result of my parents allowing me to study a profitless field based on the assumption that I would “marry rich.” Apparently, it was inconceivable to him that my parents respected my achievements and passion for the discipline. 
Outside of politics, in everyday American workplaces, the minority of men, who are unaffected by the gender wage gap but can actually concede that the wage gap exists, are happy to blame this disparity on female employees themselves for failing to take the initiative and negotiate for raises and advancement. Not only does a lifetime of being interrupted whenever a woman tries to raise her voice take a toll on her confidence and impede her ability to raise her voice, but research also suggests that even if women do raise their voices, they will be sidelined and ignored, dismissed as unimportant by men in positions of power. 
As Prachi Gupta of Jezebel has noted, one possible unintended benefit to this deeply unfortunate societal trend is that in some cases, being interrupted teaches women assertiveness they may otherwise not have possessed. Gupta cited how senior justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg “have learned to stop saying things like ‘May I ask’ and ‘Can I ask’” and simply go ahead and “say what they want to say.”
A culture that fosters self-assuredness and confidence in women should be encouraged. But this does not change or minimize the fact that we live in a society where femininity is regarded as grounds for disrespect. 
Historically, this has nearly always been the case. Queen Elizabeth I of England famously uttered that she had “the body of a woman” but “the heart of a King.” To rally her soldiers, she knew she had to adopt a masculine persona just to be respected. Historians speculate that this could be one reason for her lifelong refusal to marry — she could not exhibit vaguely feminine and domestic behaviors in order to be respected. In Egypt, the female pharaoh Hatshepsut famously dressed as a man and even wore a beard. And today, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s famous penchant for pantsuits is no accident either.
Those who have never had to tweak aspects of their identities for basic respect can sit and deny the existence of patriarchy in society all they like. But any woman who has ever been spoken over or sidelined in a dialogue, who has watched her feminine state of dress used as grounds to dismiss or even harass her and who has had to hide her femininity just to be listened to, but perhaps like Clinton, still be cast as “inauthentic,” knows that patriarchy is a fact of life.

It’s interesting that you attribute Hillary’s loss in the general election to Trump being a man and his dad’s seed MO ey.  Hillary lost because of her own issues.   Everyone knew she stole the Dem nomination from Bernie. Everyone knows she cannot be trusted.  And without marrying Bill Clinton she wouldn’t even be in the position she was in and wouldn’t have had the political career she had.  You see, she married I to power and fame. And Hillary demand and attacked women her entire career.  She has proven to the liberals that she cannot be trusted.  Conservatives have known it since the 70s.  Trump won, but the realty is that Hillary lost the election, big time.
I think your piece, though very well written, should focus on the cultural expectations of women’s behavior instead of what you perceive to be society’s expectation. They are different.

With President Donald Trump’s approval rating currently at 41 percent — a historic low for most U.S. presidents at this point in their terms — analysts are scrambling to evaluate his first 100 days in office. 
On Tuesday night, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a panel discussion to delve further into this issue, debating the successes and failures of Trump’s first 100 days. The panel was moderated by Unruh Institute Director Bob Shrum as well as Danni Wang, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan. 
This discussion aimed to seek a millennial perspective. The panelists included Nathaniel Haas, a second-year law student and Huffington Post contributor; Tiffany Hoss, the president of USC College Republicans; Mary Perez, the vice president of USC College Republicans; and Razzan Nakhlawi, the director of the international unit at USC Annenberg Media. 
“There was a lot of common ground among the panelists,” said Livey Beha, a junior majoring in NGOs and social change who attended the event. “It gave me a little bit of hope.” 
According to Shrum, Democrats are dealing with a lot of anger at the grassroots level. However, Haas put forward the idea that although the disagreement over Obamacare and the possibility of tax reforms formed a clear divide between the two parties, they might be able to agree on the improvement of infrastructure. 
When asked about the lack of backing from the Democratic party, Hoss stated that Trump would need to reach across the aisle and use his negotiation abilities to win their support. Nakhlawi argued that Trump was currently facing a disapproval rate of 53 percent in the United States, a percentage which is drastically higher than that of previous years. 
“He’s digging a hole in terms of where he stands, and he’s having a bit of an identity crisis,” Nakhlawi said. 
The panel discussion also focused on Trump’s recent missile strike in Syria that targeted an airfield belonging to the government of President Bashar Assad, largely in response to a chemical weapons attack that occurred last week.. Haas said that the lack of strategy behind this move was troubling, given the extent to which Trump has criticized Obama for taking action in Syria.
“He shouldn’t be tweeting without considering the broader geopolitical implications,” Haas said. 
The powerful role played by the media in today’s political climate was another topic of debate among the panel. 
“It’s very apparent that Trump is at war with the media,” Wang said.
Nakhwali added that most of the controversy surrounding the media was rooted in confusion due to the extremely high number of information sources available. 
Haas also denounced Trump’s attitude towards the media. 
“He needs to learn that every story that he doesn’t like about himself is not fake news,” Haas said. 
Perez agreed, stating that Trump’s constant stream of twitter posts relating to his image in the media was unprofessional. 
“However, both sides are at fault,” Perez argued. “The media needs to understand that they are alienating a certain percentage of Americans.”
In addition, the panelists also discussed their thoughts on the various protests that occurred after Trump was elected in November, particularly on college campuses. According to Hoss, the primary issue lies within the fact that many of the participants in these protests do not actually go out and vote. She said that 67 percent of millennials engage in political discourse online, yet only 18 to 23 percent of them make it to the ballot box.
The panel closed with a discussion on the upcoming midterm elections in 2018. Both Hoss and Perez agreed that things might look bleak for the Republican party, given previous patterns of the President’s political party not winning. However, Hoss believes that under Trump things might be different. 
“A new phenomenon has been created and an excitement for the Republican party has started,” Hoss said. “His base is very, very loyal.”

Junior guard Elijah Stewart declared for the NBA Draft without an agent on Tuesday. It was first reported by DraftExpress and confirmed by USC. 
Elijah Stewart is headed to the NBA Draft — for now – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
He becomes the third USC player to declare without an agent after the Trojans’ surprise run to the Round of 32 in this year’s NCAA Tournament, joining sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright and redshirt sophomore Shaqquan Aaron. Like his teammates, Stewart can withdraw from the Draft before May 24.
Stewart is not projected to be selected according to most experts’ mock drafts, perhaps making a return to USC likely, but he turned heads during March Madness, pouring in 22 points against SMU (six baskets came from behind the arc) and draining the game-winning shot.
Stewart also added 12 points and four three-pointers against Baylor, and he was the Trojans’ leading 3-point scorer throughout the 2016-17 campaign, sinking 78 threes. The total led the team by more than 30, with Boatwright and junior guard Jordan McLaughlin in second with 47 3-pointers each. Stewart was also one of the most efficient Trojan shooters from beyond the arc, trailing only McLaughlin in three-point percentage.
The junior averaged 12.3 points and 3.9 rebounds per game last season while acting as a veteran presence on a team with just five upperclassmen. Stewart’s 175 career three-pointers is sixth all-time in program history, just one bucket short of tying Harold Miner for fifth. A repeat of last season would catapult him to the top of the list; Lodrick Stewart is currently the all-time leader with 232 made threes from 2004 to 2007.
With a new contract extension and a strong incoming recruiting class, head coach Andy Enfield would surely like to retain Stewart and build on the promising 2016-17 season. The NBA Draft will take place on June 22.

As the USC football team looks to cement another title after its Rose Bowl win, the stadium that houses football games — the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum — will receive an upgrade.
The $270-million, USC-funded plan was announced in 2015 and gained approval from the Coliseum Commission. Currently awaiting city approval, the project is set to break ground after the start of the 2017 football season and aims for completion before the first home game of the 2019 season.
The main goal of the renovation is to provide the football team with a first-class facility and a home field advantage, create long-term revenue streams and to preserve the historical integrity of the Coliseum.
“Overall, people love the Coliseum because of the history of it,” said Dan Stimmler, the Chief Operating Officer of the Coliseum. “I think if you can keep the history and bring up the experience you have on a gameday, everyone will benefit. The Coliseum has an amazing history and now will have the facilities to match that.”
According to Stimmler, the stadium will receive wider seats. Additional enhancements include installing handrails, adding aisles and increasing legroom in many sections. Plans also include the construction of new concession stands while improving the conditions of existing ones. Stadium fans will also see mechanical improvements, such as upgrading the new field and stadium lighting and replacing the electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems. 
Overall, the Coliseum’s main refurbishments will boast digital enhancements. Stimmler said the renovation will update the Wi-Fi technology throughout the venue and add two large screens to the east end of the stadium. However, the overall design of the Coliseum will seek to mirror the original exterior plans.
“[The renovation] will modernize the stadium to compete for events,” Stimmler said. “This will put us in a competitive situation with what’s out there so we’ll have more events that the community can attend.”
Additionally, the renovations at the Coliseum will help gear up for the Los Angeles 2024 Olympic bid, Stimmler said.
“[The renovation] will go a long way to help the L.A. Olympics bid,” Stimmler said. “A renovated stadium that the Olympics doesn’t have to pay for that’s privately funded and will be done well in advance of the Olympics… is a big part of their bid for 2024, and [the construction of the Coliseum is]  a huge help.”
In addition to these numerous improvements, the plans look to install the Scholarship Club Tower, a new structure on the south side of the Coliseum that houses various suites and lounges. Seating within the Scholarship Club Tower requires an annual Trojan Athletic Fund membership and a one-time capital gift to USC Athletics.
Topping the Scholarship Club Tower will be the Otis Booth Press Box, named in recognition of a $7.5 million gift from the Otis Booth Foundation. 
“The Booth Foundation has been a steadfast supporter to USC Athletics in recent years and its continued generosity speaks to the strength of its confidence in us,” President C. L. Max Nikias told USC Athletics. “We are grateful to the foundation, and its choice of naming the new press box to honor Franklin Otis Booth Jr. is nothing less than a perfect match, given the family’s strong ties to Los Angeles.”
USC has included a Coliseum Renovation Preview Center where visitors have the opportunity to journey through the Coliseum’s history, relive memorable USC football moments, visualize new amenities and conceptualize the future game day experience.
“We hope this puts the Coliseum into another realm of eventspace that people have come to expect,” said Brian Grant, director of operations at the Coliseum.
