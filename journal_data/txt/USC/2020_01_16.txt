Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Manuel Castells has been named minister of universities of Spain’s new government, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced Sunday. Castells, who lived in Spain as a child before fleeing the Franco regime during his adolescence, assumed his new position Monday. 
As minister, he will oversee Spain’s 50 public universities, monitoring their finances and policy. 
Former minister of education adviser Jose Martinez-Sierra told Times Higher Education that the primary issue facing the Spanish educational system will be balancing the nation’s commitment to accessible education with maintaining the quality of its public postsecondary institutions, but it is a task he believes Castells is suited to. 
“If someone has the legitimacy, vision and capacity to undertake it, that is Professor Castells,” Martinez-Sierra said.
Castells also serves in the Department of Sociology, the School of International Relations and the School of Policy, Planning and Development, in addition to retaining his role as professor emeritus at UC Berkeley, where he taught for 24 years before coming to USC in 2003.
A prominent sociologist, Castells was the most cited communication researcher and the fourth most cited social scientist in 2015 following a 15-year study by the Social Sciences Citation Index. 
The appointment comes at a time of transition for Spain. The constitutional monarchy’s congress elected Sánchez last week after the victory of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party in the November general election, and he has since begun to assemble his government’s Council of Ministers. 
In an interview with USC News, Castells said he believed accepting the position as minister of universities to be his moral duty but acknowledged that his passion lay in teaching and research.
“Sometimes, as I have in the past, I hear an ethical call that compels me to serve for the benefit of humankind — be it in Spain, in the United States, in Europe and in the world at large,” Castells said. “I look forward to returning to my academic life after making a contribution to public service in the midst of a fundamental crisis of sustainability, democracy and moral values.”
During his tenure as minister of universities, Castells will take a leave of absence from his position at the University, USC News reported.

Warrior Bards, which finished its production season last month, takes what its members call a unique. approach to helping veterans reconnect with civilian life. Its unconventional methods of reintegration culminate in performances of Greek tragedies. According to its members, it’s unlike any other veteran program.
Supported by USC’s Arts in Action and Community Partnership programs, Warrior Bards invites 25 veterans to study with faculty from the Department of Classics, the School for Dramatic Arts and Division of Media Arts + Practice, giving veterans the opportunity to speak on their experiences in combat and the hardships they currently face.  
With roots in the Warrior Chorus program — a program that aims to connect veterans to ancient tragedies by studying literature — Warrior Bards similarly allows veterans to express themselves through a performance of Greek tragedies to a live audience of veterans and non-veterans, according to William Thalmann, a professor of classics in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“[The purpose] is really to give the veterans a way of thinking and talking about their experiences through the medium of something distant and ancient that still speaks to them,” Thalmann said. “Public performances … will be driven for veterans in the audience, but it will also help non-veterans understand what it’s like to have been at war and coming home. It helps bridge that gulf between the veteran and nonveteran community.”
Thalmann said the veterans interpreted the classical texts in ways that he hadn’t considered, helping him understand the struggles they had experienced. 
“I’ve studied Greek tragedy for many years, but I found that these veterans were finding things in text that I haven’t even been aware of just because of the experiences they were bringing to the plate,” Thalmann said. “The whole experience of working with these people has made me very aware of what it’s like [for veterans] and as a society that really has not been very welcoming [to] them.”
Megan Mosley, a member of the program, said that Warrior Bards is unique in allowing veterans to share their perspectives with civilians without feeling ostracized. 
“Sometimes that can be quite isolating for veterans to be … the poster child for how to be a good U.S. citizen, but we’re never actually heard,” Mosley said. “[Warrior Bards] was one of the few times where I think I’ve actually got to talk about my veteran experience to a civilian audience and to talk about these very deep, very raw experiences in a way that it wasn’t like I was being unpatriotic.”
Warrior Bards representative Nathan Graeser said the historical intention of these tragedies was to help soldiers openly express their struggles of war through performance. The program maintains its original purpose: to help veterans navigate their combat experiences and relay them in a contemporary context. 
“Most of the time we just say ‘thanks for your service’ and move on,” Graeser said. “And these plays don’t do that — they really sort of gauge the deeper moral issues … What does it mean when you lose people, and you don’t know how to talk about that? Or we all had friends who never made it back home. You realize that your story is not really your story. It’s a story that’s been told before you and a story that will probably be told again.” 
Mosley also said the importance of having a female faculty member in Bards — Paula Cizmar, an associate professor from the School of Dramatic Arts — was crucial to the program and resonated with her struggles in a male-dominated environment. 
“She is technically in a position of authority, and she’s a leader most importantly, whether she realizes it or not,” Mosley said. “As somebody who has kind of needed that guidance because I’ve mostly been in male-dominated industries … to be represented was incredibly important.”
Nicholas Cormier III, a veteran who previously struggled with homelessness while in the program, said it was motivating to visit the University each day. By resonating with the literature, he was able to overcome his personal obstacles.
“[Warrior Bards is] not set up to be therapy … my interpretation was … that I get to engage with [literature] that has always resonated with me,” Cormier said. “The main takeaway from me was that I’m not alone. [I’m] with people who really wanted to be there … and also be passionate about what we’re doing.”

The Gould School of Law is offering a new one-unit legal externship class that allows students to work with nonprofits that advocate on behalf of the homeless population. 
Students have been placed at local public interest law firms including Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and the L.A. County Public Defender’s office, where they will work with clients to hone their legal writing, oral advocacy and client interviewing skills. 
“The course is designed to first kind of give them a kind of real-world exposure to the homelessness epidemic that we have in Los Angeles and across our country,” said James Gilliam, a Gould lecturer who is teaching the course. 
Gilliam, who is also an attorney and coordinator at LAHSA, said his work with homelessness prevention inspired him to create the class. He hopes the experience will motivate students to pursue public interest law in the future. 
“What I recognized really quickly [at LAHSA] is that we didn’t have enough lawyers available to clients,” Gilliam said. “Even more concerning is that it doesn’t look like there’s even enough lawyers in the pipeline for the need.” 
Gilliam worked with Brenda Wiewel, director of the USC Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness, and Laura Riley, Gould director of experiential learning, to design the externship program. 
According to an L.A. County report, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased 12% over the last year, totaling 59,000 people countywide. Riley believes the firsthand experience working with homeless clients will be impactful for participating students. 
“I thought students might be interested in looking at this as a lens by which to experience their externship more impactfully, being able to look at policy issues, getting to look at the individual effects of homelessness and seeing how our city is sort of uniquely addressing the issue and what still needs to be done,” Riley said. 
In addition to work in the field, students will share their experiences at different firms once a week during class. Riley said he believes this reflective portion of the class is crucial for each student’s individual development.
“Some students are directly working with people experiencing homelessness, some are more tangentially working with that issue,” Riley said. “So it’ll be interesting, I think, for them to have that reflection learning process.”
Gilliam designed the class as an opportunity for students to witness the legal obstacles people experiencing homelessness face in securing housing and to understand how lawyers can tackle those barriers. These obstacles include outstanding debt and prior convictions, which can be expunged with legal assistance. 
“I really want them to do a full — what I call legal services — analysis of the family,” Gilliam said. “The goal is to prevent paying any money they  don’t need to pay or shouldn’t be paying and to maximize the income that’s coming into the family.” 
Gilliam also hopes students will begin to consider service gaps in the legal system and how lawyers can improve advocacy for the homeless. 
“I’m excited to have the students take a macro look at the system and make potential suggestions for improvements by the end of the semester,” Gilliam said. 
Students will also develop policy analysis skills of current legislation that may further stymie homelessness.
“There are a number of changes to state and local law that would make either drivers of homelessness reduced or establishing rights for people experiencing homelessness,” Gilliam said. 
Riley said the legal externship will cover other special topics in the future depending on student interest. Currently, students have expressed interest in entertainment law. 
Trojan Shelter Director of Media Matthew Lee supports the new class and its goal to help underserved groups. 
“When we look at underrepresented communities, one of the biggest things that really doesn’t help them is that they don’t actually have a lot of experience or knowledge in the field of law,” Lee said. “They’re underrepresented, and they don’t have the allies or the knowledge or the legal agency that they need in order to get out of these bad situations.”

This Wednesday, the School of Cinematic Art’s Cinema and Media Studies division screened several films as part of a larger conversation on race, identity and politics.   
Screenings and subsequent discussions were hosted by the school along with the Visual Studies Research Institute and the Hugh M. Hefner Moving Image Archive.  The archive is the USC-based audiovisual archive where the screened films will be added to a collection of children’s films, home movies and CBS newsreels among other audiovisual projects. 
Cinema academics and archivists from across the country, including  Hugh M. Hefner archivist Dino Everett, selected the films aiming to answer the question: “How did filmmakers develop and audiences encounter ideas about race, identity, politics and community outside the borders of theatrical cinema?”
Elements of the archive and requests for viewings of Wednesday’s films can be found on the archive’s website.

As college students perpetually fueled by caffeine, Starbucks and K-Cups tend to compose an integral part of our hectic routine. In search of energy boosts, we often get stuck in our comfort-zone cup of joe, not having or taking the time to explore other coffee types and flavors. But, as one of my friends recently remarked, coffee is and should be an experience — one shared with other people or even just thoroughly and mindfully enjoyed by oneself. Here are some coffee shop options that will satisfy your taste buds and sleep-deprived soul.
URBNMRKT 
Located near the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and South Grand Avenue, URBNMRKT is what your local coffee shop thinks it looks like. Its black upholstered chairs and sleek wood tables give it a calm and modern ambience. The spacious coffee shop is a great alternative to the libraries and other study spots available on campus that — let’s be honest — you’re probably bored of. Reminiscent of the quintessential local New York City coffee shop, URBNMRKT offers new and interesting coffee specials each week. Ending Friday is the orange mocha special, while next week offers a lavender latte. 
With Love Market & Cafe
Just a short 10-minute drive from campus, With Love Market & Cafe beckons to passersby with its inviting, fun colors and atmosphere. Founded by a South L.A. native, the coffee shop, restaurant and market hybrid hopes to engage, include and connect with residents of the surrounding area. Their horchata latte, served either hot or cold, is one of their most popular menu items. If you like your coffee with a side of giving back to the community, this is the place for you.
Highly Likely Cafe
Accessible on the L.A. Metro Expo Line, Highly Likely isn’t like the cafes you’re used to. Bright, spacious and ornate, Highly Likely has coffees for every mood, time of day and craving. Choose from a wide array of its stapes, like cappuccinos or cold brews, or dare to adventure into its specials, which currently feature a Tumeriffic latte and OK, Great!, an iced coffee mixed with Mexican Coke. Either way, it’s highly likely you’ll enjoy the drink of your choice.
Philz Coffee
Philz Coffee has some of my favorite beverages and is a personal favorite coffee shop of mine. The chain, which has locations in certain cities across the U.S. including Los Angeles, treats coffee-making like the art it is. The downtown L.A. location on South Hope Street, just like every Philz Coffee, takes care in crafting the perfect coffee, specially tailored to each individual. Choose from light, medium and dark roasts, play around with the sweetness and milk choice to find your ideal drink. If it’s still not right, the barista will fix it for you at the bar, as fast as you originally got it. I recommend the Dancing Water, a lighter blend with aromas of milk chocolate, grains and cashews.

We often hear that football is a religion, linked to ideals of “muscular Christianity,” explained by Vox’s Tara Isabella Burton as “a vision of masculine heroism deeply rooted in a colonialist view of what Christianity wasn’t.” 
It’s more deeply than the sport’s “Sunday Night Football” tradition or the staunch nationalism linked to games or figures like Tim Tebow or Kurt Warner, who quite literally exemplify the famous saying “God, family and football.” Teams like Alabama, the Oakland Raiders or even our very own USC have entire rituals and key figures — think gods and even villains. 
Just as Christianity bleeds into the lives of significant figures and historical moments, with its followers viewing certain incidents as undeniable parables, the life of New England Patriots’ tight end Aaron Hernandez gives us insight into the sport’s creed, cult, code and community structure. 
Netflix’s latest true-crime documentary, “Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,” adds a deeper layer of analysis to one of football’s most complex figures, including his 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd, as well as other criminal activity the player was linked to. It is the most comprehensive view of Hernandez relating his alleged queerness, family structure and the cult of football to his story. 
Clips that detail the culture of college football in Gainesville, Fla. — where he played — combined with commentary from a friend of his victim, are the most profound. They not only showcase a set of conditions that influenced his mindest to commit murder, but also provide a critique of football culture as a whole. 
Between the elements of analysis, the viewer is challenged to think beyond chronic traumatic encephalopathy, his sexuality and acknowledge the unrealistic God complex created around these men. In the series, he is a seemingly untouchable figure who got away with continued drug use, assault and attempted murder, aside from the 2013 murder he executed so carelessly. 
His story can be likened to the complicated King David but without divine redemption. He is likable, clearly loves his fiancée and daughter, and you may even start to feel for Hernandez when his complex relationship with his father and suppressed sexuality is detailed. In heartwarming bits, he asks his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez, to send him books from the “Harry Potter” series. The docuseries successfully balances the father, son and friend he was with the murderer he’d become.
Football is not only set up as the religion which coddles its gods but also as the beard for Hernandez’s sexuality. Details about his many tattoos, the larger build he developed and the obscenely masculine nature of the sport links his liking and interest in football to a desire to suppress queerness. And through these details and interviews speaking to queerness and masculinity, the docuseries rectifies some of the harmful reporting and media conversations surrounding Hernandez’s sexuality back in 2017.  For context: Hernandez allegedly had a secret lover in prison to whom his third suicide note was addressed to. He also killed himself two days after he was outed by investigative journalist Michele McPhee. 
In more than a recount of tabloid rumors, “Killer Inside” provides viewers with stories from friend and high school quarterback Dennis SanSoucie saying the two had a sexual relationship.  Former NFL Ryan O’Callaghan, who came out in 2017, also draws parallels between Hernandez and the life of a closeted man in professional sports. The parts about his sexuality are uncomfortably similar to documentaries detailing 
sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, comprising not only an exposé, but also a well-crafted marketplace of ideas. 
As someone who was retrospectively outraged by the worrisome reporting on Hernadez’s sexuality, where news personalities referred to Hernandez as “tight end on and off the field,” the documentary at least attempts to add nuance by weaving murder, hypermasculinity and a need to adhere to it through closeted and homophobic behavior. Despite any concrete evidence of his sexuality, a vital aspect of the series viewers will most likely point out is that the conversation is at least approached seriously. 
Hernandez’s story is one of an exceptional athletic talent who struggled with many sins and vices leading to his demise. Like many Biblical figures who dealt with infidelity, murder and a vast number of other anti-Christain behaviors, his alleged queerness and drug use go against the notions of perfection and manhood presented by Urban Meyer’s Gators, the New England Patriots and the sport as a whole. 
Similarly sports and true crime feature, “O.J.: Made in America,” sorts through a football star and sports culture, but Netflix’s take on Hernandez is stronger. The ways in which Hernandez’s mindset and relationship to the sport are presented through haunting but amazingly candid phone conversations go beyond court documents and media banter, although many questions are left unanswered — these intimate conversations strongly support theories as to the “why” behind Hernandez.
As a religion or — better yet — a cult, “Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez” shows us that football affects his most personal relationships and behaviors. You could read an article retelling the events, the backstory, the forensic details of his murder and life, but “Killer Inside” truly explores Hernandez’s mindset, illuminating the sport that developed it.

For the first time in the School of Cinematic Art’s history, an undergraduate senior thesis is being produced by an all-woman and gender non-conforming crew. “Spit it Out, Margot!,” an original comedy musical film, follows the story of a young girl with a stutter, who falls in love with her non-binary speech therapist. 
In an article published earlier this month in The Hollywood Reporter, the director explained that the selection for the crew happened organically: She met with every single person who reached out and they ultimately built a team around those who shared similar ideas of where people wanted to go with the film. 
Following the 2018 production of “Spoiled Milk” featuring an all-female crew on the USC graduate student film, “Spit it Out, Margot!” comes as an important step for SCA, as it moves toward becoming a more inclusive and representative institution in the realms of entertainment and film. 
An achievement of this degree renders itself particularly critical now, as more conversations are continually focusing on long-standing gender inequalities in the entertainment industry. With SCA’s unique positioning as the premier pipeline into the cinematic and media arts fields, it is all the more significant that attention is drawn toward “Spit it Out, Margot!”
Just this week, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been met with a series of backlash over the lack of representation in their nominees, giving all five Best Director nominees to men. Snubbing female directors like Greta Gerwig (“Little Women”), Lulu Wang (“The Farewell”) and Marielle Heller (“It’s A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”), it is unclear as to when women will be lauded for taking on such roles in filmmaking. If anything, though, this year’s nominees only fit into the largely discriminatory narrative of the Best Director category at the Oscars, with there being only five women to have ever been nominated and only one woman to actually win in the 92-year history of the Academy. 
With the perpetuation of an industry that seems to only applaud its leading males, it is essential that SCA take continued steps to provide greater representation for women — like celebrating “Spit it Out, Margot!” — while continuing to move even further away from other inequalities. 
With women comprising 50% of the undergraduate population in the school as of 2016, there ought to be no shortage of women-led crews in all future productions. 
Additionally, change may also take form in the number of women elected to faculty leadership roles in the school. Among the 32 endowed faculty positions, only eight are held by women. The quality of female faculty should not be called into question, but perhaps the institutional barriers that may have prevented more women from joining the list of endowed positions should be. 
SCA, both the institution and its students, have done much work to dismantle inequalities and attempt to level the playing field. Classes like The Film Industry: Career Challenges and Choices for Women, or groups like Women of Cinematic Arts demonstrate some of the work that has been done. 
It is necessary that an understanding, awareness and efforts to reduce the gender disparities in film are all kept at the forefront of concerns, for both SCA and the University as a whole. With USC’s existence as one of the largest and best feeder institutions in the entertainment world, a particular emphasis ought to be placed here for the continued work of the empowerment and equality of students across all genders.

The spring admission program at USC has been around for nearly four decades, yielding approximately 600 new students each year. Spring admission was originally created to admit qualified students to their perspective programs when space allows, serving as USC’s waitlist. In other words, students admitted in the spring are meant to fill the spaces of those students who graduate early or study abroad.
However popular, spring admission is not specific to USC. Many other schools — such as Northeastern University, Pepperdine University, Middlebury College and Colby College — offer a spring admission program to their prospective students as well. With that said, there is a lingering stigma that comes with the title of “spring admit,” leaving these students with the mindset that they are lesser or not as deserving of their admission compared to those who are admitted in the fall.
USC has taken strides to lessen this stigma and make spring admits feel more welcomed on campus in the fall semester prior to their January arrival. the University offers study abroad opportunities with partnered universities in Rome, London, Paris and Lugano. In addition, they offer insight into first-semester community college programs in California and the idea of a gap semester, while discouraging students from enrolling in another four-year university prior to their arrival at USC.
While these programs offer some relief to students admitted for the spring, they can be limiting to out-of-state students who do not wish to move to California before their start at USC. In addition, they can also be restrictive to students with financial constraints — as going abroad for a semester is expensive. Nonetheless, the fact that the University offers these programs, along with this insight, can prove comforting to spring admits wary of attending a large school in the middle of the academic year.
In addition to what the University offers prior to arrival at USC, there is a new resource for students: the Spring Admit Ambassador Program. This program allows for older students that have been admitted in the spring in prior years — and have therefore already assimilated to the University — to mentor incoming spring admits. This bridges a gap of uncertainty for freshman spring admits that are new to the University and allows for them to get guidance from those who know the experience best.
It may seem that the University is optimizing its spring admission program by combating some of the issues freshman spring admits face while trying to assimilate to USC in the second half of the year. However, it’s fair to say that these programs do not combat the issues of the stigma that accompany the title of spring admit.
USC plans to slash its spring admission by 50% in coming years, which may add to the stigma that spring admits are less worthy of their admission than fall admits as it sends the message to students that their value for the program has lessened with time. USC has become more competitive over the past 30 years and the University also plans to decrease fall admission as well though not quite as dramatically.
So how can USC do more to lessen the stigma and make the college adjustment easier for students admitted in the spring? For starters, USC should publicly release the statistics of the incoming spring admit freshmen in order to reduce the stigma and prove that there is no such disparity between spring and fall admits in terms of academic success in high school; the incoming freshman statistics only include those of fall admits. Unless USC is willing to include the spring admit statistics, the stigma may continue. In the meantime, it would prove fruitful to have those spring admit statistics for reference.
In terms of making the adjustment to college easier for spring admits, one of the biggest issues spring admits face while trying to assimilate on campus is housing. Typically, when spring admits arrive on campus in January, they are placed wherever there is an open bed — quite literally in place of those that graduated early or went abroad for the spring semester. 
Spring admit freshmen are usually paired with a random roommate, and it is rare that they are placed in freshman housing. This can prove to be a big challenge when it comes to assimilating on campus and with their freshman class, as being in upperclassman housing with a random roommate is not typical of the first-year experience at USC.
All in all, the spring admission program at USC serves a good portion of every incoming freshman class. While it has not yet been perfected and there is room for improvement, it’s a solid program that allows for students that would have otherwise been waitlisted to have a valid response to their application. USC should value this program and look to ameliorate it rather than to phase it out. There are a multitude of intelligent students at USC from different backgrounds — you’d be surprised by the portion of these students that are spring admits.

Prosecutors in the college admissions case released 480 pages of records Wednesday following the allegations of failure to disclose evidence brought by parents named in the case.
The records, which include emails, transcripts of phone calls and financial and academic files, suggest that former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel was assigned to investigate suspected fraudulent activities regarding athletics admissions. Heinel allegedly accepted over $1.3 million in bribes to present underqualified applicants’ falsified athletic recruitment profiles to admissions committees. She has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, aiding and abetting wire fraud and honest services wire fraud and aiding and abetting mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.
Among the released evidence was a September 2016 email exchange between a USC development official and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, who paid $500,000 to secure his two daughters’ admission to the University as false crew recruits. In the emails, which were dated about five months after Giannulli began collaborating with admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer, the administrator offered to help Giannulli with his older daughter’s application, recommending class visits, one-on-one interviews and a personalized campus tour. Giannulli turned down the proposition, later forwarding the emails to his wife and noting it was “the nicest I’ve been at blowing off somebody.”
Giannulli and his wife, “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin, filed a motion last month in the Operation Varsity Blues case accusing the U.S. government of withholding evidence that could absolve the defense of responsibility for some of the charges, alleging that Singer led them to believe the payments they made for their daughters’ admissions would fund legitimate causes. In a motion filed Wednesday, a U.S. attorney refuted the claim, saying the couple had “specifically rejected this ‘legitimate’ approach” when they declined the development officer’s offer in favor of Singer’s scheme.
The government also denied it had concealed evidence relevant to the case in the motion. To date, the prosecution has produced 1.5 million pages of emails, 2,000 pages of legal documents and 4,000 recorded calls and text messages, according to court documents. 
The prosecution filed a status report last Friday stating that Loughlin, Giannulli and 29 other parents in the case had failed to provide material that would demonstrate the extent of their culpability in the scheme. Loughlin and Giannulli face charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The couple, along with 21 other defendants in the admissions case, have pleaded not guilty and await trial in federal court.

Alma Burke quickly stood out as a qualified candidate in the Department of Public Safety’s national search for an assistant chief, according to Chief John Thomas. Her experience in community engagement with Los Angeles’ youth ultimately won her the job.
The USC alumna and former sergeant of the Los Angeles Police Department will be the first Latina assistant chief at DPS. Her law enforcement credentials span 24 years, working in undercover narcotics and cases involving homicide and sexual assault.
“I call it the one-stop shop,” Burke said. “I really diversified myself and made myself uncomfortable by learning so many new things about law enforcement and the people it serves.” 
Burke has served her community by creating Rockets in the Projects, an LAPD initiative that aims to build relationships and fortify trust with youth at a local elementary school in Watts. Part of the LAPD Community Safety Partnership, the program brings in scientists and officers to help students engineer their own rockets and encourage them to become involved in science and engineering. 
According to Thomas, the intensive program, which he hopes to implement with the department, encourages young people to pursue STEM and stray away from crime. 
“[Rockets in the Projects is] exactly the type of initiatives that I want our department to engage in with members of our surrounding neighborhood and community that live in the shadows of USC but often times really don’t benefit from that,” Thomas said. “I think those are the kinds of things I’m excited [about] when I think about what Alma can bring to our department.”
Even before the start of her law enforcement career, Burke always had a passion for justice. Combined with her love of education, she said the assistant chief position seemed to be a perfect fit. 
“I’ve always been moved by the idea of mentoring and helping those that need that help, that don’t have the support,” Burke said. “[Coming to DPS] combines my two loves: my passion for teaching and also law enforcement and knowledge.”
Thomas said her compassion for her community and her similar background to many of the University’s students and neighbors is what made her unique compared to other candidates. 
“It was those intangibles,” Thomas said. “Of being a first-generation college student, being from a minority group, and I think also understanding and knowing Los Angeles — seeing [the community] at their best and at their worst.”
Burke said she plans to continue her dedication to community engagement on campus by mentoring elementary-age students in the surrounding University area. 
“It would be nice for our local students in the community to come on campus, see how beautiful it is, but also have those same opportunities to sit down in a nice desk,” Burke said. “You take those things for granted but they don’t have … all these resources like we do at USC.”
Burke’s experiences — growing up as a first-generation student with limited resources and as a daughter of immigrant parents — have motivated her to create initiatives that reflect the needs of the community she grew up in. 
“Knowing the power of mentorship and having a village of people that are willing to help you — that was instrumental in how it shaped me, from childhood through my law enforcement career and more importantly my time at USC as a student,” Burke said.
Cultural organizations La CASA and Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs also participated in the decision making process. 
CBCSA Director Greedley Harris III said Burke visited the center and interacted with the students in an informal setting where he asked her questions to gauge how she would connect with the community. 
“I thought she had great energy, had great foresight,” Harris said. “[She] seemed like she was willing to be present in the community and wanting to break down some barriers between law enforcement and communities of color.”
In an email to the Daily Trojan, La CASA Director Billy Vela wrote on the importance of integrating cultural groups into the appointment decision to show that their voices matter. 
“To be included and to give a voice to the Latinx USC community … [it] is imperative that USC administrative leaders be socially conscious, proactive and have previous experiences with the diversity of our Trojan [community],” Vela said. 
Although DPS searched for a candidate who would focus on connecting with Black and Latinx communities on and around campus, Burke said that her goal was to build trust with all students on campus and ensure community safety regardless of their background.
“I’d like to specifically know what each student’s needs are,” Burke said. “Everyone has different needs, and I want to make sure we address those needs and more importantly, that we’re transparent when something does come up, that they know what was done about it and how we’re going to move forward.”
Burke said she wants to continue fostering relationships with students, hoping to build a similar community to the one she found on campus as a student. 
“I think she will really strengthen our community engagement efforts,” Thomas said. “Partnerships will develop in places that we have struggled in the past to have solid relationships internally. I think she will be a catalyst to that.”

Aroussiak Gabrielian, an assistant professor at the School of Architecture, has created the first wearable garden, which comprises a vest that can grow a variety of herbs and vegetables using human waste as a fertilizer. Gabrielian is the co-founder and director of design at Foreground Design Agency and developed the vest as a fellow at the American Academy in Rome. The vest is currently part of a joint exhibition entitled “Human (un)limited” by Hyundai Motorstudio and Ars Electronica in Beijing. 
In a CBC Radio interview, Gabrielian described how the wearable garden works. The seeds are set on a layer of moisture retention fabric. Left uncovered, it takes around two weeks for the base material, which are microgreens, to grow. 
The wearable garden falls within the area of agriculture called hydroponics, which, according to Grant Calderwood, a microgreens collaborator on the project and managing member of Hortus Research, is the growing of plants in water and nutrients. The vest also captures urine from the wearer via catheter to be filtered through a process called forward osmosis, which was developed by NASA and is used in space to convert urine into portable drinking water and eventually delivered to the crops as irrigation.
Gabrielian described wearing the vest as a multi-sensory feeling because of its weight and the way it is built. The vest has to be watered and serves as an insulator because of the amount of plant material that covers it. It also has a distinct smell of vegetables, such as cabbages and radishes, that are grown on it.  
“I think, you know, what is really special about Arrousiak’s project, is that it captures the imagination,” said Calderwood, who is also a Yale University lecturer on sustainability. “Like there’s the level of excitement when people see the jacket up close, growing with food on it.”
The inspiration for the vest first came to Gabrielian when she began breastfeeding her first daughter. Gabrielian was also influenced by Rosi Braidotti’s book “The Posthuman,” which poses the question, “What would a geo-centred subject look like?”  
“These ideas, of cooperation and collaboration with the more-than-human world, along with the experience post-birth, triggered the idea for the project: to use the human body and systems to feed more than just our kin,” Gabrielian wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
Gabrielian said climate change is either described at the planetary scale or the microscopic scale, which both take place outside of the realm that humans respond or relate to. 
“I feel like the issues are either too big for us to really grasp at the human scale or too small,” Gabrielian said. “And so, in my work what I’ve tried to do is kind of tap into those and bring those to the scale of the body to actually have you have a palpable experience of either.” 
While in Rome, Gabrielian worked with a vast team to develop the project, including a local fashion designer, a seamstress and Calderwood as well as Chris Behr, a chef with the Rome Sustainable Food Project and Alison Hirsch, a School of Architecture associate professor and Gabrielian’s design partner. 
The time in Rome was spent conducting plant tests, hunting down material, working with fashion designers and collaborating with the Rome Sustainable Food Project to get the vest ready. 
“It was a wonderful adventure and the project has continued to develop under Aroussiak’s leadership since we’ve been back,” Hirsch wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The wearable garden has received much media attention, some of which frames the wearable garden as a commodity. 
“Even the way it’s been framed in some of the news articles is that it’s a thing,” Gabrielian said. “It’s like a product …  It’s been kind of bizarre to see the kind of life it’s taken in the media.”
The wearable garden is one prototype out of three in Gabrielian’s dissertation doctoral work, which is currently being developed and will have three chapters with three associated prototypes. Gabrielian said that “all of the work tries to interrogate the position of the human in our environmental future and what they will be.”
Gabrielian said there are several possible avenues for the project in the future, including quantifying the health effects, quantifying carbon outputs or using the mechanical element of the project to equip the vest with sensors that could regulate the moisture content and access to sunlight.  Another route is automating the vest so that it’s self-sustaining. 
“There is that moment where it’s, you know, it was meant to be a speculative project, but all these people are interested in the real thing,” Gabrielian said. “So there’s this weird kind of dilemma, you know? Do I go there? Do I make it more real? Or do I let it kind of live in this weird in-between space? That, I haven’t yet kind of served for.”

Federal prosecutors have not received the evidence expected from 34 of the 36 parents charged in the college admissions scandal, according to a joint status report filed Friday. Only Bill McGlashan and Robert Zangrillo, who are both accused of facilitating their children’s admittance to USC as false football recruits, have submitted discovery materials to the government. 
For eight months, attorneys of the 34 defendants have refused to put forth the requested discovery material, which serves to uphold fairness of the trial by informing parties of the case about evidence that will be used in trial. Defendants are required by the government to provide this information and typically 28 days to reciprocate a discovery to the government. 
Defendants stalled submission of these documents, citing them as premature to the case.  Their attorneys also stated that the discovery materials the government itself has put forward do not comply with its own standards and, therefore, defendants should not be expected to put forth their own discovery material until the government has completed its obligations. Defendants have filed motions to compel, according to court documents. 
“The Defendants have filed certain motions to compel … and do not agree that the Government has yet complied with its discovery obligations and contend that they cannot reasonably be expected to identify documents subject to reciprocal discovery until the Government has completed its Rule 16 obligations,” the status report read.
The filing states that the government disagreed with the defendant’s claim and affirms that it has fulfilled its discovery obligations. It also states that defendants and their attorneys have been given enough time to gather materials and create strategies of defense. Supplementary materials may be added on later. 
Last month defense attorneys for actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, accused prosecutors of withholding exculpatory evidence that would aid their case: FBI interviews with William “Rick” Singer, the mastermind behind the college admissions scheme. 
Loughlin and Giannulli paid $500,000 to Singer’s nonprofit organization Key Worldwide Foundation and to former USC senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who was fired in March 2019 for her involvement in the scandal, in exchange for their two daughters’ admission to the USC as crew recruits. 
Loughlin and Giannulli have pleaded not guilty to their involvement in the admissions scandal.
In the defendants’ motion to compel production of exculpatory evidence, Loughlin and Giannuli’s attorneys said Singer’s responses in the FBI interviews depict how he falsely led his clients to believe their payments were legitimate donations. They said they believe the FBI interviews would serve as evidence that would aid in proving their innocence. 
Attorneys from both sides will meet in the federal court Friday, Jan. 17 to exchange updated information and discuss case status.

The NBA season is approximately at its midpoint, which makes for an ideal time to check in on how the league’s ex-Trojans are faring at the next level. From rookies to veterans, several USC alumni are making an impact on their respective teams — here’s a look at the most notable ones.
Kevin Porter Jr.
A promising start for Porter was cut short on Jan. 5, when the Cleveland guard tripped and injured his left knee in a non-contact injury. The injury was less serious than initially expected, but Porter is expected to miss roughly four to six weeks with a left knee sprain. Aside from the injury, Porter’s season has been up-and-down, as he’s struggled with fouls and turnovers in his adjustment to the NBA game.
Nonetheless, Porter has impressed fans and NBA personnel this season. Although he averages just 8.5 points per game in his rookie campaign, he has shown flashes of pure brilliance, as evidenced by his impactful 24-point performance on 66% shooting against the Houston Rockets in December. 
Nikola Vucevic 
Coming off his first career All-Star appearance, the former Orlando center is having another impressive season with the Orlando Magic in his ninth season in the league. Although he hasn’t necessarily reached the heights of his career-best 2018-19 campaign, his season splits are not too far off — averaging an impressive 18.8 points per game on 44.9% shooting and tallying 11.4 rebounds.
Vucevic picked up a career-high six steals this season in a December matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers and had another notable performance in a 24-rebound effort in a win over the Miami Heat on Jan. 6. Vucevic is currently in the first season of a four-year, $100 million deal he signed with Orlando this past summer.
DeMar DeRozan
Former USC star DeRozan is enjoying another solid season under Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs. DeRozan is playing some of the most efficient basketball of his career, averaging 22.4 points per game while eclipsing a 50% field goal percentage for the first time in his 11-year career. 
DeRozan’s scoring outbursts have been particularly impressive, as he’s had 30 or more points in five games this season, including a 36-point performance in Memphis on Jan. 10 in which he tacked on an additional nine rebounds and nine assists, shooting over 60 % from the field. DeRozan also had a memorable dunk over Toronto Raptors power forward Chris Boucher in a comeback win in his former home court, Scotiabank Arena Jan. 12. 
DeRozan is currently in his fourth season of a five-year, $139 million deal he signed with Toronto in the 2016 offseason before being traded to San Antonio, and he holds a player option for next season.  
De’Anthony Melton
In just his second season in the league, former Trojan and Houston Rockets draft pick Melton is showing steady growth with the Memphis Grizzlies. Melton is averaging improved numbers of 8.0 points and 3.9 rebounds per game, and he’s shooting better from the field than he did last season with the Phoenix Suns. 
Melton has excelled off the bench and seems to have found his role for now. Whether or not he can progress into the starting lineup remains to be seen — especially considering the young talent Memphis has — but he’s certainly shown encouraging signs so far. The shooting guard has had four games with at least 15 points each. 
More recently, he’s scored in double digits in three straight games for just the second time in his career. Melton is averaging a healthy 17 minutes per game, and it looks as if his game is progressing right on schedule.
Dewayne Dedmon
In Dedmon’s first season under Luke Walton with the Sacramento Kings, he has been fined $50,000 by the NBA for violating league policy by publicly requesting a trade. 
To Dedmon’s credit, however, he may have a point: Dedmon has played over 20 minutes in just five games this season. In four of those, Dedmon reached double digits in scoring, including one 18-point, six-rebound performance in Philadelphia in late November. 
In his past two seasons with Atlanta, Dedmon averaged 25 minutes per game and was a frequent presence in the starting lineup. In his first season in Sacramento, Dedmon was relegated to more of a bench role, seeing his minutes diminish to just under 14 minutes per game. 
Dedmon’s frustrations are understandable, but it remains to be seen how Sacramento will handle his trade request with the deadline looming on Feb. 6. Dedmon is still in the first year of a three-year, $40 million deal he signed with the Kings this offseason.

With a new semester at USC underway, the spring slate of sports teams are set to begin their seasons within the next few weeks, and some are already in full gear. With that in mind, here’s a look at nine different Trojan athletes — each from separate teams — that are poised to make waves this spring. 
Men’s basketball
Freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu’s spectacular play this season is a big reason why the Trojans currently carry an impressive 13-3 record. The former 5-star recruit leads USC in a host of statistics, such as points scored (253), blocks (44) and free throws made (51). Okongwu is also second in the Pac-12 in blocks per game (2.9) and boasts the second highest shooting percentage (62%) of any player in the conference. 
Okongwu is projected to be a lottery pick in the NBA Draft and is expected to continue his indispensable role on head coach Andy Enfield’s squad as USC attempts to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in three years.
Women’s basketball
Despite an underwhelming performance thus far for the USC women’s basketball team, freshman forward Alissa Pili has proven to be an unexpected spark for the Trojans game after game.
Recruited out of Anchorage, Alaska, Pili was a three-time Alaska Gatorade Player of the Year before joining the Trojans. Now, the freshman leads USC in points scored (201), free throws made (42) and rebounds (120). Though an 0-5 conference record isn’t the start Trojan fans hoped for, Pili’s play has provided reason for optimism as USC closes out the second half of the season this spring. 
Baseball 
After a career best season, senior outfielder Brady Shockey looks poised for another strong year as he and his team — led by first-year head coach Jason Gill — hope to make the College World Series and win the Pac-12 for the first time in almost 20 years. 
Last season, Shockey recorded 14 RBIs, scored 24 runs and had a career-high slash line of .295/.331/.403, while also tacking on four stolen bases. If USC hopes to begin its return to prominence, it’ll need Shockey to play a big role — starting when the seasons opens against Western Michigan in February.
Women’s lacrosse
After winning Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year as a sophomore in 2018, senior Kerrigan Miller put forth another All-American season last spring, generating a conference high 38 turnovers while garnering Pac-12 Tournament MVP honors and repeating as midfielder of the year.
As USC looks ahead to the upcoming season, watch out for Miller to be a force.
Men’s tennis
Junior Daniel Cukierman, ranked No. 1 in the Oracle ITA Division I National Fall Rankings, started 2020 with a tournament win at the Oracle Pro Series last week. Cukierman also paired up with senior Riley Smith to win doubles at the competition.
In September, Cukierman took down No. 7 junior Keegan Smith from UCLA to win the Oracle ITA Masters. As Cukierman continues to dominate in both singles and doubles play, look out for him to excel as the Trojans head into the NCAA Tournament later this spring.  
Women’s tennis 
Senior captain Angela Kulikov is currently No. 60 in the nation in singles and No. 29 in doubles with her partner sophomore Danielle Willson, according to the ITA. She won singles in the Milwaukee Tennis Classic last September and made it to the Round of 16 for doubles with Willson at the ITA All-American Championships. 
Kulikov also made it to the doubles semifinals of the NCAA Tournament last season with her former partner Rianna Valdes. As the women’s team prepares to return to the court this spring, watch for Kulikov to build upon her legacy at USC. 
Men’s track and field
Although this is senior distance runner Isaiah Jewett’s second year with USC after transferring from UC Irvine, the San Diego native has made a major impact during his tenure at USC.
Jewett is the reigning indoor 800m school record-holder with a time of 1:46.91 and holds the Pac-12 title for the 800m as well. The All-American finished last season placing 7th at the NCAA Indoor Championships for the 800m while also serving as anchor for USC’s Pac-12 winning 4x400m relay team. Keep a close eye on Jewett when USC competes in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Collegiate Invitational later this month. 
Women’s Track and Field
Redshirt senior sprinter Angie Annelus is arguably the best 200m female runner in the NCAA. The team captain has won back-to-back 200m NCAA championships (2018 and 2019), while breaking the USC school record with a time of 22.16. 
Annelus does not only dominate in the 200m, but she is also a critical part of the 4x100m relay team, which also won the NCAA championship and broke the school-record last season with a time of 42.21. Annelus is poised for more success as she heads into her final collegiate season. 
Women’s Water Polo
With the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo on the horizon, many of USC’s top scorers from last year’s team have opted not to play with the Trojans this spring in order to prepare for the Games. 
In light of the absences, sophomore utility Bayley Weber looks poised to have a breakout season. Weber was part of the 2019 MPSF All-Newcomer Team as a freshman and scored 34 goals last year. She’s also part of the U.S. Junior National Team and was the top scorer at the 2019 World University Games. Pay close attention to Weber as the Trojans, who fell one game short of an NCAA championship last spring, start the season against Cal Baptist later this month.

The USC men’s basketball team will look to extend its best start to a season since the 2016-17 campaign when it welcomes California to Galen Center Thursday.
With already two Pac-12 wins over Washington State and crosstown rival UCLA, the Trojans are currently tied for third place in the conference standings. USC is now preparing for its fourth Pac-12 matchup and first conference home game against the Golden Bears.
So far this season, the Trojans have had the upper hand in almost every statistical category compared to the Bears. Cal is currently 8-8 but has been playing well as of late — most recently, it beat Washington in a 61-58 overtime thriller. Cal sophomore guard Matt Bradley banked a game-winning 3-pointer for the upset win.
That same Washington team took down the Trojans 72-40 in Seattle last Sunday — USC’s only loss in its last eight games. But as much as USC has been winning, Cal is starting to regain momentum of its own, coming off two impressive wins following a four game losing streak. 
“[The Golden Bears] have won two big games at home and they are playing very well and they are very confident,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “Cal has a lot of talented offensive players … so we know with the way they’re playing now, they’re playing much better basketball.”
Since starting off 4-0, the Golden Bears have not quite seen that same level of success that they were hoping for. Yet, with players like Bradley and graduate guard Kareem South getting hot as of late, Cal is tied with USC in the Pac-12 with a conference record of 2-1.
If the Trojans hope to win their third conference game, they will have to contain Bradley, a key player for Cal all season long. Averaging 17.7 points a game, Bradley is also making more than 35% of his 3-pointers and is averaging 5.1 rebounds.
“[Bradley] is an elite scorer in our league and we have to have good on-the-ball defense with him, meaning we can’t give him wide open uncontested shots and we have to have a body on him for most of the game,” Enfield said.
As for the Trojans, look out for forward Nick Rakocevic, the senior captain who has been a staple for the Trojans the past three seasons and is showing no signs of slowing down. 
Rakocevic had a huge bounce-back game in USC’s battle against UCLA. After shooting 2-14 from the field and scoring only 6 points against Washington, Rakocevic shot over 50% from the field and scored a team-high 17 points in USC’s win over the Bruins.
So far this season, Rakocevic is averaging 11.8 points and nine rebounds a game. His continued contributions should increase the Trojans’ chances at taking home a Pac-12 title.
Furthermore, an unsung hero for the Trojans has been freshman Ethan Anderson. Anderson, a 6-foot-1 guard from Los Angeles, has helped keep the defense strong for the Trojans all season long.
Anderson has had nine games with at least one steal and is averaging over five assists per game. Even though Anderson’s playtime averages under 23 minutes a game, he has made a considerable impact  this season.
With an overall record of 13-3, USC is off to a strong start this year. Nonetheless, there are still 15 regular season games to go, all against Pac-12 teams.
“It’s important for us to come home and have the crowd get behind us and continue our momentum,” Enfield said. “We had a nice bounce-back game from our loss, I think we’ve won seven out of eight and so we’re proud of our players … This homestand is big for us.”
USC takes on Cal Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at Galen Center.

Is life actually good? Aubrey “Drake” Graham’s success in the 2010s cannot be disputed since his music has ruled the charts for years and maintains a significant radio presence. While many may argue that Drake is still in the prime of his career, there has been an increase in talk surrounding his professional and personal behavior, signaling a change in the public perception of who Drake really is. As the previous decade came to a close, his persona as the face of mainstream hip-hop now carries a different image. Coming out of 2019, Drake has emerged as an artist with a sharply polarized audience. 
Drake maintained a relatively strong media presence through his myriad different interests including music, fashion and weed, with his new company More Life Growth Company. In one of  Drake’s most recent media appearances, he sat in his Toronto mansion for Tidal’s “Rap Radar” podcast. Though the podcast was quite long and extensively discussed Drake’s past musical influences, it was mostly a space where Drake bragged about himself, with no uncomfortable or critical questioning. It felt more like an opportunity for Drake to build himself a more positive narrative rather than an interview.
During the podcast, Drake addressed his recent controversies involving Pusha T and his defeat to the Virginia rapper in their 2018 blockbuster rap beef, with Drake taking the final hit as Pusha revealed to the world his hidden son. In the interview he avoids mentioning Pusha  by name and brushes off the incident as a violation of rap battle rules because Pusha mentioned his son. His views on the incident received a lackluster response from his interviewees, and the discussion feels scripted, coddles the rapper and only supports his views of the rap beef. In his appearance on LeBron James’ HBO talk show, “The Shop,” he addresses similar topics in a space surrounded by close friends and associates. Both interviews fail fans of not only Drake but of hip-hop overall through the lack of criticism or questioning on how he handled the situation.
In addition to criticism of his media presence, unfavorable opinions surfaced on the internet in 2019 regarding footage from one of his concerts years ago. This is not meant to be an accusation of any wrongdoing by Drake but rather an observation into how conversations around the hip-hop mogul have turned unpleasant, given the recent awareness in the media to inappropriate behavior ala the #MeToo movement. In one clip, Drake slow dances with and kisses a 17-year-old girl on the neck. 
Similarly, Drake has been criticised for other inappropriate behaviors with celebrities years his junior. Fifteen-year-old actress Millie Bobby Brown revealed in an interview that Drake has texted her “I miss you” and gave the “Stranger Things” star advice about boys. Brown talked about the rapper warmly and expressed nothing but gratitude for his help, yet the idea of a 32-year-old man texting a then-14-year-old girl didn’t sit right with many. 
The same sentiments were felt when popstar Billie Eilish recounted a similar experience with  Drake in a November 2019 interview with Vanity Fair. Eilish, 17 at the time, talked about how he’s a very nice guy and texted her as well. As Drake is a prominent musical artist and popular culture figure, his actions do not go unnoticed in our cognizant social environment. 
Drake’s recent music has also contributed to this shift in public thought. The U.K. drill sound has defined a couple of his last few singles including “Behind Barz” and “War.” Many have  questioned whether Drake is a “culture vulture,” stealing musical stylings that are not native to him. Although he has faced controversy on this matter before with his use of Afrobeats slang and musical styles, his recent U.K. influence has divided the hip-hop community, with some believing he is exploiting the popularity of Afrobeats and others lauding his acknowledgement of borrowing musical styles and his appreciation of the original art form. 
We can also look at his latest single titled “Life is Good,” featuring the rapper and his longtime collaborator Future. This is the first time the duo has been featured on a song together since their widely successful 2015 collaborative record, “What a Time to Be Alive.” The song is split into two parts, with Drake’s verses and hook starting the track, followed with an interlude and verses by Future. The structure of the song is incoherent, with Future’s part completely independent from Drake’s performance in both flow and beat. 
Both professional critics and those on Twitter seem to agree that the song feels carried by Future’s verse while Drake’s has taken some flack for his contribution to the record. Pitchfork goes as far as to label his verse one in which “Drake gets to go all petty king and continue to pretend Pusha T hasn’t rattled him unimpeded.”
The two artists have recently been posting on social media together and there is growing speculation surrounding a potential sequel to their 2015 album. Could this album be a way for Drake to turn around the negative public image that seems to be growing against him in the media? After the release of this single, the view on this potential collaboration is split two ways: Some fans view the rumored album similar to a Hollywood movie sequel aiming for box office success rather than a project with artistic integrity; others simply think it’s a new project from two of the biggest artists in hip-hop.
I have always been a fan of Drake’s music but having noticed this shift in how he is respected by the online community, it will be interesting to witness what his next move will be. After watching these two interviews in which Drake positions himself in his own world with his own rules, it’s going to be harder in the future to please an audience with a growing distaste in what he has to offer and how he acts. The fact that Drake has to adhere to these more exclusive and safe avenues of public engagement might mean that, behind the scenes, life might not be as good as his latest song implies.
