An internal USC Title IX investigation concluded that the popular Song Girls program was inconsistent with core University values – uncovering “sufficient evidence” that many members endured body shaming, harassment and retaliation under the leadership of former head coach Lori Nelson, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.
Nelson, who led the squad for more than three decades, submitted her resignation the same day the University launched a Title IX probe into her conduct in October 2020. In a comprehensive interview with the Times, the Song Girls described a toxic culture of control and scrutiny – as Nelson admonished her squad for their eating habits, physical appearance and sex lives. 
In a memo to the L.A. Times Wednesday, USC Vice President for Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX coordinator Catherine Spear concluded Nelson was responsible for fostering a “hostile and unhealthy environment” during her tenure as USC Song Girls coach. 
The internal investigation also explored allegations of race- and gender-based discrimination within the program but cited “insufficient evidence” to corroborate those claims, according to the Times.
The Times spoke to 10 former Song Girls in April who said body image issues were the norm during Nelson’s tenure, who conveyed the impact Nelson’s leadership inflicted upon the lives of individual members of the squad. 
According to the Times, three former Song Girls said they developed eating disorders due to the unhealthy environment and one member expressed she endured depression and suicidal ideation. In addition, two song girls believed they were victim to Nelson’s retaliation after being eliminated from the squad after submitting formal complaints to USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn.
In a statement to the L.A. Times, Spear wrote that Nelson will not face consequences for violating harassment and retaliation policies because USC did not have the authority to impose disciplinary action as she is no longer a University employee. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp wrote that the University is committed to implementing additional measures to ensure an inclusive and welcoming environment.
According to Crisp’s statement, the new measures will provide education and training for all coaches, students and faculty involved in the Song Girls squad. Additionally, the Office of Student Affairs will reexamine the team’s contract and ensure the language is consistent with the University’s values. The office will also conduct an online anonymous survey by the end of the academic year that will provide current and former Song Girl members a safe opportunity to voice their experiences, suggestions and concerns with the program. 
“Ongoing assessment is a critical part of higher education, and we are looking forward to continuing to evaluate the Song Girls and other student programs to ensure all students experience an inclusive and welcoming environment at USC,” Crisp wrote. 
Crisp acknowledged the shortcomings the program faced in recent years.
“Regrettably, not everyone has experienced the program in the positive way it was intended,” Crisp wrote.
Nelson’s attorney, Ryan Saba, told the Times that USC’s findings exonerate Nelson from accusations of discrimination on the basis of race, sex and appearance.  
However, Saba pushed back against the University’s findings, arguing that the evidence presented in the investigation does not support the conclusion of the report.
Saba highlighted that the members who filed complaints did so after being cut from a team by a panel of judges who were not associated with Nelson. He said the statements of those judges contradict the claims of wrongdoing on Nelson’s behalf.  
Nelson’s attorney did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment.

USC fans had a serious case of déjà vu as some of them made the trek up the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum steps toward the exits midway through the third quarter. By the end of the game, the Trojans suffered a 45-27 loss to Oregon State University, two weeks after the blowout defeat to Stanford. Oregon State’s win marked USC’s first home loss to the Beavers since 1960.
Defensive coordinator Todd Orlando’s unit had no answer for the Beavers’ offense for most of the game, whether it was on the ground or in the air. At one point in the game, USC’s defense gave up five-straight drives for a touchdown, as Oregon State went on a 35-3 run from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third. 
“I think Oregon State just had a good game plan for us,” said redshirt senior safety Isaiah Pola-Mao in a press conference after the game. “We didn’t make the adjustments. Our defense relies on making our plays. We put people in one-on-one positions. They just made their plays better than us.”
Oregon State’s running game was the team’s driving offensive force early on. The Beavers had 319 rushing yards, mixing in traditional handoffs with jet sweeps and read options that kept USC off balance. Seven Oregon State players reached double-digits in rushing yards, and redshirt junior running back B.J. Baylor led the way with 158 yards on 23 attempts. 
“[Their] offensive coordinator was great schematically,” interim head coach Donte Williams said in a press conference after the game. “Their [offensive] line was able to double team, chip away and get up front, and their running back was a great player. They made some plays and stuck with it.”
In the second half, the Beavers’ passing attack came alive. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Chance Nolan played the finisher role for Oregon State — he had the first four Beaver touchdowns. Nolan threw for 213 yards on 15 of 19 passing with 4 touchdowns and two interceptions. 
Redshirt junior wide receiver Tyjon Lindsey torched the USC secondary with 102 yards on five receptions with 2 touchdown catches.  
“The work’s not done,” Pola-Mao said. “We’re not a finished product right now. We still have a lot of season left, so we’re just gonna go back to work.”
Junior quarterback Kedon Slovis returned to his starting position after missing most of last week’s game against Washington State because of a neck injury. USC’s lead man looked fresh to start the game, orchestrating the quick-tempoed air raid offense. The Trojans couldn’t keep up with the deficit as the game went on. Slovis finished with 355 yards on 31 of 49 passing with 1 touchdown and three interceptions.
“I thought the ball was coming out of [Slovis’] hand well,” said offensive coordinator Graham Harrell after the game. “He’s gotta find a way to finish drives. When adversity hit, the energy got sucked out of it. That just can’t happen.”
Unsurprisingly, one of the few bright spots for the USC offense was junior receiver Drake London. He ended the game with 165 yards on 10 receptions. 
Senior running back Keaontay Ingram started the game for USC and had his most productive outing yet. His first touchdown was his highlight of the night, making multiple defenders miss after a bobbled snap and handoff on his way into the end zone. By the end of the game, Ingram tallied 79 yards on 14 attempts with 2 touchdowns. 
“He did a heck of a job,” Harrell said. “[We were] still trying to sneak a couple runs in just to get him touches … If we weren’t in such a big hole, we would’ve kept feeding him because I do think he had a hot hand.”  
The result was a rude introduction for Williams in his first game in charge at the Coliseum. 
“Tonight just wasn’t our night,” Williams said. “They outcoached us and outplayed us. It will all get fixed, I promise you that … We have to make sure that we learn from this, and we come back tomorrow and keep building.”
USC will look ahead to University of Colorado Boulder on the road Oct. 2.
