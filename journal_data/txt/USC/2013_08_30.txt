With all the attention being paid on who would start at quarterback for the USC offense, it would be understandable for some fans watching the game to forget that the team actually had to play defense on Thursday night, too.
The Trojan defense quickly reminded them of its presence.

Led by a downright dominant performance by the front seven, USC relentlessly hounded Hawai’i quarterback Taylor Graham all night en route to a 30-13 victory.
For new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, his new gig could not have gotten off to a better start.
USC allowed Hawai’i to gain only 231 yards and forced four turnovers, including redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw’s 35-yard interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter that gave the Trojans a two-possession lead.
Pendergast’s defense needed to be overpowering on this night, because the Trojan offense was anything but. With redshirt quarterback Cody Kessler at the helm for the entire first half, USC sputtered on offense, gaining just 159 yards and turning the ball over twice. The offense also allowed Hawai’i to score its lone five points of the game, with a safety and subsequent field goal as a result of good field position following the punt.
Coach Lane Kiffin’s playcalling was extremely conservative all night, largely restricting his gunslingers to checkdowns and short routes.
Both Kessler and Max Wittek were unspectacular, although Wittek’s stat line would have looked more impressive had Lee not dropped what would have been a sure-touchdown in the waning moments.
No matter USC’s offensive struggles, the defense continued to bring the pressure, rendering the Warriors’ running attack nonexistent and forcing Graham to fire wild passes under duress. In his first career game for Hawai’i, Graham finished just 16-for-41 for 208 yards and one touchdown with four interceptions.
Although the Trojan offense struggled through the air as well, the running attack mostly split between redshirt junior Tre Madden and freshman Justin Davis was effective with both backs averaging more than five yards per carry.
Although Madden was the offense’s workhorse with 18 carries and 109 yards, Justin Davis impressed in his collegiate debut with multiple displays of athleticism, including an acrobatic leap over an oncoming defender en route to the end zone for the only rushing touchdown of the night by either team.
Even sophomore tailback Javorious “Buck” Allen impressed in his four carries, trucking a Hawai’i defender on a highlight run for a first down in the fourth quarter.
The wide receivers did what they could with what they had, and Marqise Lee managed to put together a 109-yard performance despite his quarterbacks going a combined 15-for-29 with 172 yards.
Lee was not without his faults — the junior Heisman contender dropped a fourth-down pass on the Trojans’ first drive into the red zone and fumbled away the ball on a punt return in the second quarter to go along with the dropped long ball from Wittek.
Sophomore Nelson Agholor pulled in the Trojans’ only passing touchdown of the night from Kessler, who also threw an interception.
Both teams struggled to convert on third down, with USC going 3-for-14 and Hawai’i going 4-for-18.
USC struggled with penalties as well, conceding 75 yards on nine penalties, including two flags for illegal substitution infractions on the same drive.
The Warriors finally put a touchdown on the board in the last minute, as Graham completed a Hail Mary pass to freshman receiver Keith Kirkwood over the head of USC freshman cornerback Devian Shelton.
But overall, the Trojan defense held strong against the hapless Hawai’i offense, with redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard, redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey and freshman safety Su’a Cravens all racking up interceptions.
Bailey also recorded a sack to go along with two apiece from sophomore defensive tackle Leonard Williams and junior defensive tackle George Uko.
Junior kicker Andre Heidari was strong in his debut, going three-for-three on his field goal attempts including a career-high 52-yard conversion to close the first half. Otherwise, the rest of the Trojans special teams looked shaky and had trouble protecting Lee who managed only eight yards on two punt returns.
The Trojans will have to improve on offense if they wish to compete with the stronger competition they will be facing in the Pac-12. Compared to the likes of Oregon, Stanford and UCLA the Trojans lacked polish on offense and failed to establish any sort of rhythm even with Kessler playing for the entire first half.
Kiffin will be pressed to make a decision regarding quarterbacks soon but neither seemed to distinguish themselves as the clear-cut leader in the ongoing race for the starting gig.
It will be interesting to see how Pendergast’s 5-2 defensive scheme manages against higher-powered offenses in the conference, but on this night they displayed the chaotic potential the scheme possesses.
The Trojan faithful have to hope that the offense establishes  a sense of continuity going into the Pac-12 opener next week at home against Washington State.

Max Wittek should be the starter.   Cody Kessler needs to ride the bench.
Kiffin better get his sh*t together. It is time to win and win big….

The USC women’s soccer team hopes to build on its season-opening winning streak as the Women of Troy take on Cal State Northridge in their first home game of the season at 3 p.m. on Friday.
No. 22 USC (2-0) opened its season at the USD Tournament last weekend in San Diego, beating No. 11 San Diego State 4-1 before defeating the host Toreros 4-2.
Senior forward Elizabeth Eddy, who became the first USC player since 2010 to be named Pac-12 Player of the Week, led the offensive surge with three goals in the two matches. Sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink and freshman forward Tanya Samarzich each added a pair of goals for USC, while freshman forward Kayla Mills had a pair of assists.
“We did score a lot of goals last weekend, but I think we’re capable of more,” USC head coach Ali  Khosroshahin said. “We just need to be smarter in our decision-making. I haven’t had a team that worked this hard and cares this much in a long time. It’s an absolute treat to be out here with them every day.”
Junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley has converted 5 of 6 save opportunities in two games and the Women of Troy’s backline has performed admirably in limiting opponents’ chances so far.
“I think the biggest difference that was displayed this past weekend was the atmosphere,” redshirt junior defender Mia Bruno said. “The environment of this team is so much more positive, and we finally get along as a team. We enjoy each other’s company and I think that translates on the field.”
The Women of Troy have outshot their opponents 34-16 (16-9 on goal) in their first two games, including 16-6 in the first half.
USC hopes to add to the struggles of the Matadors (0-2), who have been outscored 5-0 this season in losses to No. 5 UCLA and Arizona State. They have been outshot 26-11 (8-6 on goal), with four players tied for the team lead with 2 shots each.
Last year, Northridge finished with an overall record of 11-5-6 and Big West record of 6-1-2 to secure a spot in the NCAA tournament, where they fell to San Diego State in the first round 3-0.
The Matadors’ roster looks drastically different from last season after graduating top scorers Melissa Fernandez (8 goals, 5 assists) and Stephanie Galarze (4 goals, 1 assist). They’re also breaking in two freshman goalies, Rebecca Harper and Jovani McCaskill — with Harper starting both of the first two games.
Junior forward Brittanie Sakajian (1 goal, 5 assists) boasts the highest point total of all returning players, and scored her only goal last season against the Women of Troy in the teams’ 1-1 draw.
The Women of Troy are 3-0-1 all time against Northridge.
“This is the first time since 2008 that we’ve had more healthy returners than new players,”  Khosroshahin said. “It’s really nice that we have the returners helping you teach the game plan, and we haven’t been able to do that for a few years.”

The USC women’s golf team will start defending its national championship this upcoming season with the preseason No. 1 ranking from the Division I College Women’s Preseason Coaches’ Poll that was released Wednesday.
With the Women of Troy returning all five of their starters from last year’s NCAA championship team, the vote to put USC on top was nearly unanimous, receiving 26 of 29 first-place votes.
Alabama was voted to the No. 2 spot, while Duke, last year’s NCAA championship runner-up, was voted third. Two Pac-12 teams, UCLA and Arizona State, were voted fourth and fifth, respectively, to round out the top five.
Led by coach Andrea Gatson in her 18th year at the helm, the Trojans’ starting lineup features an array of All-Americans.
Sophomore Annie Park, the reigning WGCA and Pac-12 Player of the Year, is expected to anchor the starting quintet. Senior Sophia Popov, junior Doris Chen and sophomore Kyung Kim also received All-American honors last year, and senior Rachel Morris was voted All-Pac-12.
The Women of Troy also welcome a couple of the nation’s top junior talents in Gabriella Then and Karen Chung this season to complete the rotation along with sophomore reserves Kim Santiago, Ellie Chai and Victoria Morgan.
The team will once again have great expectations this upcoming season after winning a school-record seven events and the NCAA West Regional en route to capturing the national championship last year.
They open up the 2013-14 campaign on Sept. 9 to 11 at the Dale McNamara Fall Preview at the Tulsa, Okla. Country Club, which will also host the 2014 NCAA Championships in late May.

Senior forward Ari “Ace” Stewart has been ruled academically ineligible for the upcoming 2013-14 season but will remain at the university to take classes, a source close to the team confirmed to the Daily Trojan. Stewart’s dismissal was originally reported by Galen Central earlier this week.
Stewart transferred to USC in 2011 after playing two seasons at Wake Forest, where he averaged 8.5 points and 4.4 rebounds per game during his sophomore campaign.
He redshirted the 2011-12 season with the Trojans, a season in which the team finished with a historically poor 6-26 record. Last year, he averaged 3.4 points and 1.8 rebounds in a little more than 10 minutes per contest under head coach Kevin O’Neill and later interim coach Bob Cantu. His shooting percentage suffered a major decline, falling from 39 percent with the Demon Deacons to 31 percent with the Trojans.
Stewart was set to be one of six seniors on the 2013-14 roster, including guard J.T. Terrell andcenter Omar Oraby, among others. Junior guard Byron Wesley, sophomore forward Strahinja Gavrilovic and freshman forward Roschon Prince could be in line for more playing time under new head coach Andy Enfield with Stewart unable to play.
In addition to six incoming freshmen, the Trojans will look to offset the loss of Stewart with four new transfers, though only two — senior point guard Pe’Shon Howard (University of Maryland) and senior center D.J. Haley (Virginia Commonwealth University) –— have been approved to suit up for USC this year. The other two, sophomore forward Darion Clark (UNC-Charlotte) and sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt (UNLV), must sit out the season to gain eligibility next year.
Stewart isn’t the first member of the team to succumb to academic issues. Prior to the start of the 2012-13 season, then-junior guard Maurice Jones was also ruled academically ineligible and later transferred to Iowa State.
The Trojans open the 2013-14 season away from home on Nov. 8 against the Utah State Aggies.

Most of the excitement in USC sports has been in anticipation of the start of Trojan football. But there was some big news this week for a different men’s sports team —one with arguably more prestige than those guys who play in the Coliseum.
On Tuesday, USC announced that baseball coach Dan Hubbs, who took over for former coach Frank Cruz late last season, had officially been promoted to the full-time director of the program. Hubbs played for USC from 1991-3, playing in three NCAA Regionals — an accomplishment athletic director Pat Haden would certainly welcome given the program’s current state.
The Trojans still hold the record for most NCAA Division I championships (12), twice as many as the next closest competitor. In fact, the baseball team’s total of 12 national titles even bests the football team’s total of 11 — and yes, I’m including the BCS Championship win over Oklahoma in the 2004 season — What are you gonna do about that, Mr. Emmert?
But the present rendition of the squad looks nothing like the team that was once a perennial power.
The program has had seven straight losing seasons and last year’s team won fewer games than any USC baseball squad in the last 59 years. Athletic director Pat Haden is hoping that Hubbs can return the program to its former glory.
“I am excited for the opportunity to continue as the head baseball coach at USC,” Hubbs said in a press release. “To coach at my alma mater is very special. I look forward to building upon the rich tradition of USC baseball.”
Hubbs, a former pitcher and assistant coach for the Cardinal and Gold, openly dreamed about becoming the manager one day and did just that last year, but in a less-than-ideal situation.
His boss at the time, former manager Frank Cruz, was fired just two days before the start of the season after investigations revealed he broke NCAA rules about practice time limits and Hubbs was promoted to the top spot.
Hubbs led the group to a 20-36 season, the fewest number of wins in a season for the Trojans since they went 18-4 in the 1954 season.
With a total of 16 true freshman on a team of 35 last year, the team led the Pac-12 in walks surrendered yet were last in the conference in walks drawn. That is merely the sign of a young team; an extra year of experience should give pitchers more confidence and command, while hitters should feel less nervous and more patient at the plate.
With all but two starters in the field returning along with the entire starting rotation and most of the key guys from the bullpen, there are plenty of reasons to believe the Trojans will reverse their downward trend and start winning more ball games. The extra year of experience for Hubbs should pay off as well, especially now with him able to set the tone at the start of training camp.
But is Hubbs the best guy for the job? How quickly can a guy who’s never been a head coach before start convincing future major leaguers to come to Troy and get to the College World Series on an annual basis again?
Well, probably not right away. He’ll need to show his ability to develop players into prospects over the next couple of years before the culture around the team, or more specifically the recruiting scene, changes.
It’ll take more than just hustle, work ethic and dedication to consistently compete in a tough Pac-12 conference that has provided the last two NCAA champions (Arizona in 2012, UCLA in 2013).
Pete Carroll and his staff were arguably the best in the business at developing guys for the NFL. No team has had more players drafted into the league than USC with Carroll at the helm, and that made a huge difference in bringing in players that could win BCS bowls.
And yes, USC really did try to nab UCLA’s coach for the job. John Savage, an established recruiter who has been head coach in Westwood since 2004, has made several trips to Omaha since then and finally helped win the Bruins their first national championship ever in baseball this past season.
Offered a contract worth seven figures according to the Los Angeles Times, Savage declined the offer to switch loyalties in the bitter crosstown rivalry, despite spending time with the Trojans as an assistant back in the 1990s. Though the move would have been one of the greatest steals in sports rivalry history (I would say narrowly ahead of the Yankees acquiring Babe Ruth from the Red Sox but not quite as cool as when Dr. Arthur Toga and Dr. Paul Johnson left UCLA’s Laboratory of Neuroimaging to come work at Keck last year), I’m happy USC stayed in house.
Sure, it will take longer for Hubbs to get USC back to Omaha, but I definitely think he will a couple years down the road. It says a lot about his character that USC would offer him the job at a relatively young age and with relatively little experience.
As a lifelong St. Louis Cardinals fan, the move reminds me a lot of the Mike Matheny hire two years ago, as he too had never held a managerial job and was much younger than the other considered candidates. But the Cardinals finished just a game away from a World Series appearance in his first year.
So USC will probably lose more than half of its games this year on the diamond, and that’s OK. It will take some time for players and prospects to get a feel for his personality and know that he’s the right guy for the long run.
The coaching hire lends itself to a baseball metaphor — the move is not quite as exciting as stealing home, and is much more like scoring a guy from third via a sacrifice fly. But the point is that USC still manufactured a run with the move. And that’s what the program is going to be all about — manufacturing a run.
First off the team lost three starters in Landecker, Roberts, and Zebrak who were the top three avg. hitters with
half the home runs. Hubbs lost five of six top recruits to the pros in this year’s draft. Stupid statement of staying
in house when Savage coached at USC for many years under Gillespie. Carroll didn’t do too badly being an
outsider of the Trojan family at the start. Obviously the athletic dept. was not thrilled with  Hubbs looking for
someone else besides even Savage, and resorted to making Hubbs permanent. A multiple year deal was done
to show support which was not warranted at this time.

With a healthy dose of incoming freshmen and one of the strongest groups of returning upperclassmen in recent memory, the USC women’s volleyball team is prepared to overcome last season’s quarterfinal exit in the postseason and embark on a long, successful 2013 campaign.
Up and over · Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard (1) led the Women of Troy in hitting percentage (.394) and blocks (0.95 bps) last season. – Daily Trojan file photo
The Women of Troy, ranked No. 4 in the preseason American Volleyball Coaches Associaton poll, head to West Lafayette, Ind. this weekend to participate in the Mortar Board Premier tournament. The team will square off against host No. 16 Purdue on Friday before taking on Western Kentucky and Alabama A&M in a Saturday doubleheader.
“I think we’re getting challenged very well in this tournament. We have two Top-20 teams in the tournament,”  head coach Mick Haley said. “I want to get the jitters out and make everyone’s focus really strong. I hope we can win the matches, but when you start with a Top-20 team, you get everyone zeroed in quickly.”
The Women of Troy put together a strong 2012 campaign, finishing the regular season 30-6 (including a dominant 17-1 mark at home) before succumbing to Texas at the NCAA Regional Championships. Though they’ve only had to face the departure of one starter — outside hitter Katie Fuller — they welcome six new freshmen at three different positions.
Senior libero and captain Natalie Hagglund, a two-time All-American, emphasized the importance of leading by example and assimilating the newest members of the team.
“It’s really important as a leader or upperclassmen to support the freshmen and prepare them for even worse than what it may be,” Hagglund said. “We want to make sure that our upperclassmen are focused every day, and we can share our stories and experiences with the freshmen to inspire them.”
Haley noted that regardless of the roster makeup, starting the season on the right note is crucial, and drove home this point as his team prepares for the opening tournament.
“We really want to get comfortable with our serve-receive patterns. Each year is different and we’ve moved players around, so there’s always a different set of patterns,” Haley said. “The other focus is having the defense be consistent. We constantly work on that because that’s what keeps us in matches when we can’t pass as well as we would like. Defense always starts with blocking and offense with passing, so those are the two points of emphasis.”
Haley adopted an aggressive approach during practice, one that was certainly not lost on the players.
“He has been harping on a sense of urgency, and for us that means fighting for every ball like it’s the last point,” Hagglund said. “We have to be tenacious on defense and really good in practice, because hopefully you can play a great game if you’ve been great in practice.”
Winning is always an understood goal, but Haley also wants to make sure that the various parts of his lineup can coalesce into a strong, dependable unit.
“Playing these teams on the road, we can’t afford to make many mistakes,” Haley said. “We played Michigan State three or four years ago up there and lost in five sets because we couldn’t sustain the focus.”
USC is expected to incorporate several of the new members of the squad into the starting rotation due to the strong freshman class, ranked second in the nation by PrepVolleyball.com.
“We have six new members on the team and may be starting as many as two or three of them, even though we only lost one,” Haley said.
Among the newcomers expected to make a mark this season are outside hitters Ebony Nwanebu of Fairview, Texas and Elise Ruddins of Laguna Niguel. Standing at 6-foot-4 and 6-foot-3, respectively, the two will be expected to fill the void left by Fuller’s departure and complement the duo of sophomore Samantha Bricio and senior Sara Shaw. Being thrown into the fire against a top-20 team such as Purdue in their first collegiate match might be challenging for the freshmen, but Haley knows playing a tough nonconference schedule should help prepare them for even more formidable opponents as the season goes along.
“I think it will be a very challenging trip for us,” Haley said. “But [playing tough teams] is something you have to practice.”
