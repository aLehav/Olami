Twilight shifted to dusk near NeueHouse Hollywood on Thursday evening, setting the mood for the warm, friendly and intimate red carpet event ahead. A small group of media personnel, event planners and PR staff intermingled and relaxed while waiting for the event to begin. As the last bit of daylight ebbed away and the streetlights came on, the cast and crew of Hulu’s “Tell Me Lies” arrived on the scene. Much like the stars of the show, the night was young, and there was now an air of soft excitement as the event commenced.
From screenwriter and producer Meaghan Oppenheimer, “Tell Me Lies” is the latest college drama to stream on Hulu. Adapted from Carola Lovering’s novel of the same name, the show stars Grace Van Patten, previously seen in “Nine Perfect Strangers,” as Lucy Albright, a college freshman who falls for upperclassman Stephen DeMarco (Jackson James White). The series explores the two characters’ toxic yet exhilarating relationship over the course of eight years.
Oppenheimer and her husband, Tom Ellis, most commonly known for his work in the Netflix show “Lucifer,” were the first to arrive at the red carpet. Oppenheimer credited her ability to relate to the story as what led her to adapt it.  
“I think so many people have been really messed-up and thrown off track by a relationship,” Oppenheimer said.
Alicia Crowder, who plays Diana, also read the novel and said “you can’t put it down.” 
“It’s so amazing, and it’s perfect for TV too,” she said. 
Afterward, the show’s actors and crew streamed into the venue. As each member of the cast arrived, the red carpet grew livelier as they caught up with each other and laughed. The small venue suited the intimate and close nature of not only the show, but also the cast. 
Catherine Missal, who plays Lucy’s friend Bree, talked about filming with her co-stars. “The wedding was really fun to shoot because it was the first time we were all meeting each other but the chemistry, we had to all have known each other for eight years, so we all kind of jumped right into it, got on set… It was an instant connection!” Missal said.
The show also saw Van Patten reunited with one of the show’s directors, Jonathan Levine, who she had previously worked with on Hulu’s “Nine Perfect Strangers.” 
“I was so happy to hear he was doing [this show]. It was a completely different experience and a completely different show and character. So, it was great to see him in a different light,” Van Patten said. “He did such a great job, and he understood the show so well. ” 
Similarly, the cast had an understanding of the message they wanted viewers to take from the show. White said he hopes that audiences won’t interpret this show as a “love story,” but rather as a “representation of toxic behavior.” 
“I hope they learn to talk about their feelings,” White said. “I hope that if it reminds them of something from their past, maybe it helps them heal.” 
The last star to arrive at the red carpet was executive producer Emma Roberts. All cameras turned to her and there was even greater excitement as she confidently posed for the red carpet. 
As the 8 p.m. screening time slowly approached, media personnel began packing up. The cast and crew slowly made their way inside the venue to get ready for the screening, carrying the lively, warm spirit of the red carpet with them inside. 
The first three episodes of Hulu’s “Tell Me Lies” aired Sept. 7, with subsequent episodes airing weekly on Wednesdays.

Taylor Jenkins Reid’s new novel “Carrie Soto is Back” has soared to the top of the New York Times bestseller list.
The titular Carrie Soto is the greatest tennis player of all time. Coached by her father and former tennis star, Javier “the Jaguar” Soto, Carrie climbed to the top ranks of women’s tennis in the ‘80s with her domineering attitude and aggressive style, giving her the nickname ‘the Battle Axe.’ With 20 Grand Slam titles under her belt, Carrie is untouchable. Unbeatable.
That is until 1994. Carrie no longer plays tennis, and Nicki Chan is the new face of the sport. Through her climb to the top, Nicki has accumulated 20 Grand Slam singles titles, making her the first woman to do so after Carrie Soto in 1987. If there is one thing Carrie despises more than her descent into obscurity, it’s being bested. After six years, Carrie comes out of retirement with one goal: to reclaim her record.
Due to Reid’s affinity for setting her books in the same universe, readers first see Carrie in “Malibu Rising” as the cruel and cold ‘other-woman’ in a seemingly perfect marriage. She’s the girl everyone loves to hate—the girl no one wants to root for.
Surprisingly, she is no different in “Carrie Soto is Back.”
Carrie is by no means a likable character. She is brash, abrasive, cold and reserved. Carrie relishes that she is an unflinching pillar in the tennis community and doesn’t feel the need to change. Her once admirable behavior on and off the court has now earned her the nickname ‘the Bitch’. She is Aggravating, with a capital ‘A’. But the beauty of Reid’s writing is her ability to create empathy for characters where that originally seemed unimaginable. Somehow, it feels natural to cry, scream and laugh with Carrie. She feels so real that you can’t help but identify with her — even if you’re not a tennis champion.
Reid creates situations and tensions that feel incredibly immersive, making tennis — a sport I’ve never played or watched — feel gripping. I screamed, ranted, cried, and I’m sure my heart grew ten sizes. The audience gets to know Carrie through her young age, her retirement and, eventually, her comeback. With the addition of newspaper articles, interviews and talk show transcripts, Reid places the reader right in the middle of the ’90s. 
“Everything we achieve is ephemeral. We have it, and then the next second, it’s gone.”
Carrie’s relationship with her father highlights the true meaning of the novel at its core. Much like Carrie, Javier is a character that sprouted off the pages. Early on, the reader was able to hear about the rise and fall of his tennis career through the eyes of Carrie, as well as his determination to raise a daughter he could live vicariously through. Throughout the novel, the lines of their relationship blur from father and daughter to coach and athlete. Both thrive off the trophies, the applause and the records, making themselves mirror images of the other. This relationship is not only honest but refreshing in a genre where parent and child relationships aren’t normally highlighted.
‘Carrie Soto Is Back’ is more than just a book about tennis. It is a book about heart and the thin line between self-discipline and self-destruction. It is a book about female ambition and the anger that meets women who refuse to be cut down to size. As Serena Williams — the very woman who inspired the character of Carrie Soto — says, “I always believe I can beat the best, achieve the best. I always see myself in the top position.” And most importantly, it is a book about family and the sacrifices and meaningfulness that come along with it.
“Carrie Soto is Back” is a whirlwind from the first page to the acknowledgments. The novel is a fast-paced read with relationships as tense as any match point. If any book deserves more than five stars, this is the one. Do yourself a favor and pick it up; you won’t regret it.

With several fraternities recently announcing their disaffiliation from USC’s Interfraternity Council to form the new University Park Interfraternity Council, these fraternities no longer face due disciplinary process from the University if they violate the values and policies of the University and the IFC. 
The University’s values are outlined in SCampus, the 130-page student handbook that covers everything from academic integrity to discrimination and harassment. The IFC’s policies include detailed diversity, equity and inclusion reforms, as well as an 11-page preliminary action plan to address issues of sexual violence and misconduct in reaction to the multiple reports of drugging and sexual assault reported at Sigma Nu last October. 
In contrast, the UPIFC has one three-page document, titled “University Park IFC Constitution and Bylaws,” which outlines a “University Park IFC Events Policy” and is accessible through a Google Drive link on their official website.
Here is a quick summary of what may change now that fraternities have disaffiliated from the University:
Social gatherings
According to the University, event hosting and participation is a “privilege of recognized fraternities and sororities in good standing, and can be revoked based on change in organization status.” Therefore, when the University deems that an organization is not in “good standing,” they can invoke a suspension of all social gatherings of the organization — as they did when they imposed a fraternity-wide ban on all social activities last October. 
Following the incident, the University also implemented a detailed plan for a phased return to normal social activities after March 2022, conditional upon compliance with revised IFC policies, such as the full completion of all members’ prevention training requirements, the signing of a new accountability agreement and a more comprehensive event planning and review process.
The UPIFC Events Policy writes that “Chapters are limited to 15 large Social Events per academic semester. Large Social events include tailgates, house parties, and formals.” However, the parameters of these events, including the estimated number of people in attendance, are not defined.
There is also no clear mention of a governance structure of the fraternities’ social activities mentioned in the UPIFC Events Policy. The only mention of a higher governing authority occurs in the clause that, “Chapter event plans must follow Chapter inter/national organization requirements, local and state law.” 
Though both the University and the UPIFC require fraternities to register the social events they intend to hold, it is unclear how the UPIFC will hold organizations who violate their policies accountable.
Alcohol
The policies on UPIFC regarding alcohol are similar to the University’s alcohol policy of social gatherings, with the UPIFC directly paraphrasing the terms stated on the University’s Event Hosting Document for Fraternity & Sorority Leadership Development in their Events Policy.
The majority of the policies regarding alcohol are identical, including the prohibition of alcohol products above 15% alcohol by volume and activities like drinking games that encourage the rapid consumption of alcohol. The policies also encourage fraternities to take measures to identify those under the legal drinking age of 21.
However, there are a few minor differences. While the University prohibits “[c]ommon sources of alcohol, including bulk quantities,” the UPIFC allows bulk alcohol if it is being “served by a licensed and insured third party vendor.” Additionally, while the University regulates philanthropy events by limiting them to one day and requiring them to be alcohol-free, the UPIFC does not mention this. 
The UPIFC does make it a requirement for fraternities to provide water at social events and encourages them to provide food.
Sexual violence
The reports of sexual violence and drugging at Sigma Nu last October forced the University to take greater action to condemn and prevent further incidences of sexual violence in fraternities. Several policy changes included the completion of all fraternity members’ University-mandated prevention education modules, an increase in the number of weekly meetings for pre-event planning and post-event reviews and stationing security guards at stairs or hallways leading to bedrooms at social gatherings. 
The UPIFC’s “Events Policy” has several similarities to University policy. It does not mandate,  but still strongly encourages, the use of security guards to ensure guests do not venture away from the party space and designated restrooms. Fraternities under the UPIFC are also required to have benzodiazepine test strips accessible at each registered event for guests to use to test beverages for contamination.
While the University has a slew of workshops and programs to educate members of the Greek system about consent and sexual violence, there is no mention of any such initiatives being rolled out for fraternities in the UPIFC, other than a rule that all fraternities will have to make guests and brothers aware of the “Pillars of Consent” at the entrance of all social events. There is no extra information provided about what constitutes these “Pillars of Consent”.
Hazing
In addition to California state law and respective chapter regulations, the University lists various prohibited actions it considers to be part of hazing and writes that having a “choice” to participate in these activities does not mean the actions are compliant to guidelines. The University cites the coercive power of peer pressure and power dynamics of individuals seeking to gain membership into an organization.
On the other hand, UPIFC’s Events Policy makes no mention of hazing, other than declaring that “[c]hapter members or guests must not permit, encourage, coerce, glorify or participate in any activities involving the rapid consumption of alcohol, such as drinking games” as part of their Events Policy.
Diversity, equity & inclusion
The disaffiliation of fraternities rolls back the many diversity and inclusion initiatives the University has rolled out over the past few years, as fraternities no longer have an obligation to adopt them. A few of these initiatives include the restructuring of recruitment and the IFC executive board to accommodate the formation of a DEI committee, and the creation of a Black and Indigenous people and people of color Scholarship to promote inclusivity in both new members and existing leadership.
The UPIFC does not mention anything about promoting diversity and inclusion or its leadership structure, and it is unclear whether these existing initiatives put forth by the University’s IFC will be continued.

“Wait, can you not speak Korean?”
For the past 19 years, this question has loomed ominously over my identity. While I went to Korean school for five years, as I often joke, it was on Saturday mornings. Hence, the only thing eight-year-old me learned how to do was con my teacher out of the answers.
Still, despite being born in Daejeon, South Korea, having an unhealthy obsession with banana milk and interning with a Korean American organization for three years, I often feel lost. In the spectrum between Korean and American, I’m wandering with half a clue and a malfunctioning map. Somehow, I’m too American to fit in with Korean standards but too Korean to align with American culture. 
At times, navigating my identity almost feels like a game of “Where’s Waldo?” When ordering in English at Korean restaurants with non-Korean friends, I wince internally. In Advanced Placement history courses, the curriculum and textbooks glorify the American dream while breezing over the roles and experiences of minorities, including those of Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders. I learned plenty about Manifest Destiny and the Revolutionary War  — but in lectures, I wondered where the “flavor” was. What of the Asiatic Exclusion League? Angel Island? Pearl Harbor and the Japanese internment camps?
Not only are Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders often viewed as “others” in American history, their stories are rarely told transparently — if they are even told at all.
Tags like “keep your head down,” “hardworking” and “quiet” are commonly held biases ingrained against Asians in American culture and society. Promoting the “submissive” Asian stereotype, these impressions mistakenly assume that the AAPI community is “not like other minorities” (haha quirky), and therefore doesn’t need as much help or aid as other groups. What’s even more confusing is that some of these tenets are actually encouraged in certain ethnic groups or interest communities. Korean culture, for example, pushes for perfection in work and unblemished success. Paired with mental health stigma (illnesses perceived as being “lazy”) that run deep in Korean customs, a culture of toxic perfection tends to glorify, if not promote, elements in the model minority myth. Despite conducting extensive research on the symptoms and gender disparity within ADHD, it took me years to convince my parents to let me get tested, simply because they believed I wasn’t trying my best to study or stay focused. 
Frequently referred to as the “model minority,” the AAPI experience is akin to navigating H Mart right before Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) or Lunar Festival:
You go to an understaffed H Mart right before holiday and they just got new shipments of everything. Employees are scrambling trying to account for items and haul them over to their respective shelves. In the midst of this chaos, you realize the Melona bars you specifically came to the location to buy are not there. While they have similar brands, the aisle is so packed that after a couple seconds, you get pushed back into a swarm of frantic halmonis. You could’ve sworn you saw some boxes in the stack of shipments, but it’s no use. It’s so crowded, you can’t even see the freezer window. Asking someone for help would be an option — that is, if you could catch up to one of the 10 workers sprinting through the store. So you do the only thing you can do: You turn around and leave.
It’s sad that the Melona bars weren’t there when they should’ve been. In fact, if your recollection was correct, they could’ve been there. But they weren’t, and that was that. Maybe, you muse, in an hour they’ll be there, and you can rejoice, but that depends on a range of variables that are unaccounted for.
Dashing down the aisles of American history, legislation, policies and culture, AAPI communities and interest organizations work to mitigate some of the damages. At USC, organizations and clubs such as the Korean American Student Association, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Delta Phi Kappa and more create community and conversation where it lacks. Nestled in a busy metropolis, students at USC have access to opportunities where they can connect with their roots and explore other cultures. Despite these efforts, however, the assumptions asserted by the model minority myth, lack of diverse voices in American curriculum and deep-rooted biases and impressions have lasting effects, regardless if they are acknowledged or not.
Recently, College Board announced the release of a new course: AP African American Studies. While this is a big step for College Board as a corporation and American education in general, educational entities such as the Board and the Department of Education need to do more to recognize and value AAPI commitment and experience. 
I don’t speak Korean, I have a low spice tolerance and I don’t watch K-dramas. But I was born in Korea, I grew up on H Mart runs, Yogurtland and bingsu, and I regularly supplement the dining hall food with Shin ramen, Chocopies, banana milk and honey butter chips. I may not be secure in my identity as a Korean American, and may not be for a while. But, regardless of whether I’m comfortable with it or not, as a member of this community, I have a responsibility to remember, learn from history and ensure it is accurate. You do too.

I remember the rush I felt when I first downloaded Instagram as I tried to come up with the most epic, humorous, yet brilliant, username my little tween self could conjure. I believe I settled on @sarahtheawesome1131, 11 being my favorite number and 31 being the day of my birth. I was absolutely thrilled to be sharing with my sphere of influence (the 50 kids in my grade, the 10 people on my club volleyball team and my cousins) only the finest that Versagram and iFunny had to offer. 
I have been on the app for over a decade at this point. There is absolutely no way that Sarah the Awesome (still relevant, I think) could have imagined the digital wasteland and advertising powerhouse that Instagram is today. For both brands and those who brand their persona, Instagram is feasible as a career. From the plethora of influencers (micro and macro) to those deemed A-List celebrities, having a digital identity is commonplace, if not sometimes necessary. 
While there is much to be said about Instagram, “social media is bad and toxic” isn’t exactly a groundbreaking revelation; however, even so, our overstimulation and overexposure to media through apps like Instagram, Twitter and TikTok continue to permeate much of our day-to-day lives for a multitude of reasons. One that isn’t discussed as much is the fact that we are exposed to the lives of a plethora of people whom we may not ever meet in person.
When entering a college sphere, it’s completely normal to feel anxious and feel a desire to assimilate into the population as quickly as possible. Thus, just as ubiquitous as being down for a chill night in but also a fun night out, is dropping one’s socials in a college Facebook group of thousands, as well as anyone within earshot the first few months one is on campus. However, the more nefarious phenomenon is the first, of following and being followed by droves of people due to the sole commonality of what — assuming we all pass — shall be our alma mater. 
We gain ideas of people we have never, and may never, meet or only know peripherally based on how they create their public social media personality. This growing web of interconnectedness has created a culture of unnecessary voyeurism. Why have I witnessed the entire life of a girl I followed on Instagram from a Facebook group freshman year through social media, while never meeting her face to face once? If I have, there is absolutely no chance there was a verbal greeting. How are you supposed to introduce yourself to someone you have “never met” when you have seen an aggregate of their life through a curated collection of content? I’m sure many of you, myself included, have introduced yourself to someone you have digitally been in contact with — bridging an awkward tension of knowing yet not knowing. But then, do you want to be the one ousted for remembering such an ephemeral interaction?
With this, there also exists this belief that if you won’t follow someone on Instagram, or if you unfollow them, it brings about this air of superiority, which, at times, can be valid. Yet, on the flip side, if I don’t know you, if you don’t know me, why should we watch each other live our best lives (as that is all that’s going to be palpable to a general audience of one’s Instagram followers)?
So no, while it isn’t easy to limit these empty online interactions, I won’t feel bad unfollowing you if I have never met you. Or, at the very least, if not desiring to so harshly sever that tie, I will mute your posts. Why must energy and limited brain space be filled with someone’s life who does not pertain to mine or those I love? I’m a brave soldier, I know. But someone has to do it.

The men’s water polo team cohesively flashed their strength at home and on the road, taking down No. 7 Long Beach State and Golden West College on Thursday and sweeping a double-header against Pomona-Pitzer and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps on Saturday. The Trojans improve to 6-1 on the season. 
In their first home game of the new season, the No. 3 ranked Trojans won 14-10 in a back-and-forth overtime affair against the Beach that featured six goals from graduate student driver Massimo Di Martire, a career high for him and a season high for any USC player. This game also marked USC’s 35th consecutive win over the Beach. 
USC started hot with a commanding 8-4 lead, thanks to a productive effort from redshirt sophomore goalie Blake Jackson — who finished with a career high 13 saves. The Beach stormed back and took the 9-8 lead with only 2:25 left in regulation time. However, a clutch goal from Di Martire with 1:31 left kept the Trojans alive and sent the game to overtime. 
USC’s offense took over in overtime, with redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt scoring the first goal to make it 10-9, followed by goals from redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen and three more from Di Martire to lead the Trojans to a 14-10 overtime win. 
“I don’t think we felt the pressure… we handled this pressure very good,” said Di Martire after the game. “The first game was pretty tough… we were supposed to close the game before, instead we brought the game to overtime, and we were good to close the game in the overtime.”  
Similar sentiments were shared by Jackson.
 “I really like how the team came together in overtime and won the game, so I was really happy about that … We are a really good overtime team, and we knew what we had to do,” said Jackson. 
Head Coach Marko Pintaric reflected on the importance of closing out overtime games.
“The only good thing about this whole day is I like this overtime. I like this pressure and it’s good for the guys to be exposed for that,” Pintaric said.
USC went on to play an exhibition match against Golden West College. With a hat trick from freshman driver Jack Vort, along with goals from freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic, junior 2-meter Tony Nardelli and sophomore driver Jake Carter, the Trojans defeated the Rustlers 13-9. 
USC carried the momentum from Thursday’s matches into Saturday’s Inland Empire Classic against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (CMS) and Pomona-Pitzer (PP). The Trojans began the weekend red-hot, scoring eight consecutive goals — two of which came from driver Ashworth Molthen — and shutting the Stags out in the first period. 
The Stags shifted momentum in the second period, scoring four goals. The Trojans, however, quickly squashed any chance of a comeback, finishing with a 21-12 victory with 13 different Trojans scoring one or more goals. Senior driver Chris Sturtevant, Molten and Nardelli all finished with hat tricks in game one. Goalies Kyle McKenney and Eric Hubner platooned in the cage, totaling nine saves.
The second game of the day against Pomona-Pitzer yielded similar results. Jackson continued dominating at the net, allowing only three goals through two periods of play. Hubner also showed off his skills, preventing a goal in the third period. The offense possessed similar success. Molthen racked up another hat trick and 13 other Trojans scored goals, leading to a confident 19-8 victory against the Sagehens. 
Jackson noted the team’s improvement in chemistry as the season has progressed. 
“It’s going really well; it’s probably one of our strongest qualities,” said Jackson. 
However, there are aspects of the game that the team feels need to be improved — most notably, the defense. 
“We definitely have to work on defense more, especially in the fourth quarter. We gave up a lot of goals, which is pretty disappointing,” said Jackson. 
Coach Pintaric also noted the lack of defense in the fourth quarter and stressed the importance of “finding the best chemistry floor rotations and then offensively setting each other up better to create more high percentage opportunities.”
But the team has high hopes for the rest of the season.
 “I think we have to play for the title, and absolutely we are to be sure of our values,” said Di Martire. 
USC heads north Friday for a three game road trip, with a game against Pacific University at 5:30 p.m. in Stockton CA, followed by games against UC Davis and Navy on Sept. 17 in Davis.

Since the start of this heat wave, I have felt bogged down a lot more than usual, with most of my energy drained by the time I get home. Even the sheer act of getting up from bed and turning on the PlayStation4 feels like a colossal achievement. 
Thankfully, I was introduced to something powerful enough to break the lethargy: rhythm games. Yes, I know, it doesn’t sound like it would work — even for an avid gamer like me. As the name suggests, this genre consists of games where you must press keys to the rhythm of whatever song is playing. And, while I have dabbled in them occasionally (I mean, who hasn’t tried out “Dance Dance Revolution” only to fall face first on the floor?), I never considered myself a fan. I thought their mechanics were too simple to enjoy. Why bother trying if all great players can do is press some notes faster than the average person?
Turns out, for someone who was deeply burnt out, that sort of simple gameplay was exactly what I needed. If it was just clicking buttons to match the song, I could even enjoy it in the comfort of my bed. So, despite my lethargy, I dove head first into this new genre, expecting the video game equivalent of comfort food — and hey, maybe even come out with some leaderboard titles. How hard could pressing notes on time be?
Well, really really hard.
While the main mechanic is straightforward, developers have put in incredible effort to make their creations more complex for users of all skill levels. Different types of notes require different actions (click, hold, flip, etc.), notes are displayed at varying speeds and the highest difficulty levels feel more like “bullet hell” games than rhythm ones. 
Needless to say, my experience was akin to a baptism by fire rather than the comfort I wanted. But novelty fueled curiosity and my daily life was finally energized. 
Now, some readers may be expecting me to talk about rhythm games in esports. Sorry to disappoint, but this isn’t what I have planned. No, this column isn’t in fact about rhythm games specifically, but rather what they made me do: seriously compete for leaderboard titles.
In other words, the true purpose of this column is to understand what it takes to become a pro gamer.
That’s right. After writing this column for over two years, I’ve observed countless angles when it came to esports, but I never thought to sit in the pro gamer’s chair myself. And, while I certainly couldn’t think of doing that with games like “League of Legends” or “Valorant,” I finally found a genre where the barrier to entry was low enough to give me hope. While it won’t directly apply to the experience of signed athletes that play strategy-focused titles, I thought I’d try to understand a bit more about their routines and mentality by devoting myself to a competitive game for the first time ever. Because rhythm games have public leaderboards, it felt like the perfect genre to try and increase my skill. 
Like I said before, while the genre’s principles are easy to understand, they become increasingly complex. The scoring system encourages challenges through higher rewards at harder levels. There were days when I instantly failed a song on a hard level after originally acing the easier difficulty. But, while that may be a cause of frustration initially, it becomes rewarding once you manage to clear them. Unlike most other games, competitive games allow you to track your skill increasing the more you play them, which motivates you to continue. 
I found that to be one of the most enjoyable elements of the game, and it seems like the developers are also aware of it. They give you special titles if you click every note in perfect sync, which serve as a point of pride that you can display, showing other players just how advanced your skills are. The otherwise repetitive element of always playing the same songs gains novelty, as you try to improve your score. Much like a mountain climber always practicing with one specific route, the repetitiveness gives you familiarity with the obstacle you are ultimately trying to overcome. 
All of this, of course, dialogues directly with the biggest element of being a professional gamer: the sheer amount of practice required to succeed. Regardless of the genre you play, you will need countless hours of practice to even scrape the surface of that professional world. Many athletes have spoken about their inhuman routines, where they spend most of their day playing the game. Before starting this personal challenge, while I always respected their dedication, I could never understand how someone could spend thousands of hours playing the same game to exhaustion.
This was the greatest takeaway I received from attempting to go pro in rhythm games. The reason why gamers can spend so much time playing the same game countless times isn’t only because of the high skill ceiling or complex mechanics. Rather, it is that these games have, inherently, a way to make hours of grinding more enjoyable. Those aiming to become competitive staples of the esports industry often have titles or ranks to encourage players. But it is rather what these things represent, the gradual increase in skill level, that retains gamers. Eventually, even if you reach the top of the leaderboards, you will likely continue practicing, not because of any title, but because you enjoy getting better in a game that perfectly accommodates that.
Regardless of the time I devoted, I could not ascend to pro-gamer level in such a short time span. While this investigation has come to a close, my desire to keep improving remains. As a final note, if any of the readers also enjoy rhythm games, please take a break whenever you see someone with the username “gui” underneath you in the leaderboards. While I certainly appreciate the dedication that athletes put to their craft, I am not too prideful to accept some charity. After all, those leaderboard titles look too pretty to not have.
