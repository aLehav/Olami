After battling back from injury to win his most recent match against Arizona, senior Peter Lucassen used his steady performance to secure a spot as this week’s Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Coming on strong · Senior Peter Lucassen has missed time during the season with various injuries, but has played well as of late, including a singles win over Arizona. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
In a 6-4, 6-3 victory against the Wildcats’ Borja Malo, Lucassen played in just his second match in the last 12 games. His win helped the Trojans grab a 5-0 lead in which they never looked back.
Lucassen’s play helped advance the No. 2 USC men’s tennis team to its 12th consecutive win, compiling an 18-2 overall record. Now, the team is one win away from cliniching a Pac-10 title.
“I love tennis more than anything in the world, and it feels great to finally play again and be a part of the team,” Lucassen said.
Lucassen is in good company as fellow Trojans senior Jaak Poldma, junior Steve Johnson and freshmen Emilio Gomez and Ray Sarmineto have all earned the honor this season with Poldma and Johnson each receiving the award twice.
Lucassen made the 2010 NCAA All-Tournament Team a season ago and has a 12-10 overall singles record.
His last win before Saturday was Feb. 4 against San Diego. Since then, he has battled injuries, including a stress fracture in his foot.
This marks the first time Lucassen has received the honor, but he insists its just good to be back on the court with the Trojans one win away from clinching the Pac-10 title.
“It’s great support from the team, the coaches and all the players that I won this award, but it means more that I’m back on the court and can be there for the team,” Lucassen said.
Lucassen was selected to the 2010 NCAA All-Tournament Team last year and is one of two seniors, along with Johnson, on the USC roster this season.

Ambles returns to practice
Markeith Ambles returned to the practice field Tuesday ­— sort of.
The wide receiver spent the morning practice running and doing disciplinary drills in what was just the latest in a string of punishments for the sophomore.
Ambles missed Saturday’s practice at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and offered no excuse at the time.
“He made a mistake,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said Tuesday. “We hope that he continues to learn and grow from his mistakes.”
Ambles confessed he was angry with his coaches last week, although he now defines this conflict as a misunderstanding.
“I felt like they didn’t understand, because on Wednesday night I had a wisdom tooth [removed], and they didn’t know about it and I didn’t tell them, so that was the whole problem,” Ambles said.
Last Wednesday, Ambles missed a weightlifting session. He was forced to run during Thursday’s practice and ended up leaving halfway through.
Ambles entered USC last year as one of the most highly regarded receivers in his class. But so far, it has been his off-the-field actions that have largely defined his college career. Last October, he was suspended from the team for two weeks. He left the team the following month, but returned in January after deciding not to transfer.
Ambles has been punished on numerous occasions for showing up late to team functions or skipping them entirely.

McDonald named candidate for Lott Impact trophy
Junior safety T.J. McDonald has been added to the 2011 Lott Trophy watch list. The Lott IMPACT Trophy honors the top collegiate defensive player in the nation.
McDonald led the Trojans defense in 2010 with 89 tackles and also reeled in three interceptions.
The list of 42, Lott’s number as a player, includes players from all positions on the defensive side of the ball. Eleven of the Lott nominees were awarded All-American honors last year and 10 received academic honors within their respective conferences.
Ronnie Lott announced the list at a Pacific Club IMPACT Foundation luncheon in Newport Beach, Calif.

USC student-athletes honored
Senior Nia Ali of the women’s track team, junior pitcher Austin Wood of the baseball team and freshman Jeffrey Kang of the men’s golf team were all recognized for their athletic performances last week.
Ali performed exceptionally well at the Texas Relays last weekend. She had an official mark of 13.0 seconds in the 100-meter hurdles semi-finals, third fastest all-time at USC. After achieving this time — the best that USC has seen since 2007 — in the semis, Ali also placed second in the final with a time of 12.74 seconds.
Wood was honored for his contribution to the baseball team’s victory over No. 11 Stanford. The junior allowed one unearned run in eight innings Saturday and struck out a career-high eight batters. The Trojans defeated Stanford 3-1, and captured their first conference series win.
Kang was honored for leading the USC men’s golf team to its first tournament win since 2009. The Trojans won the 39th annual ASU Thunderbird Invitational by 14 strokes Saturday, but not without the help of Kang. The freshman ended the tourney with a 5-under 208 (71, 69, 68) — a season best. He has had five under-60 rounds so far this season.

NCAA issues warning before NFL draft
The NCAA wrote a letter to collegiate underclassmen warning them of the consequences that could accompany attending draft parties on NFL draft day, according to ESPN.com.
NCAA rules state players who are not eligible for this year’s draft are unable to receive free transportation, housing or food if they attend the draft parties of their former teammates.
Dena Garner, the director of Player Security Services for the NCAA, reiterated this point by instructing the athletes to “not jeopardize the NCAA eligibility of … friends or former teammates.”
The NFL draft is set to take place April 28-30 in New York City, with many draft day parties scheduled for the days leading up to the event.

USC’s offense outplayed the defense during Tuesday’s scrimmage, a sharp as the defense has dominated much of the early spring.
Despite missing players because of injuries sustained in Saturday’s scrimmage, the offense was successful, recording two plays of more than 50 yards and going 6-for-6 in short yardage situations.
LIghtning speed · Junior running back Curtis McNeal flashed his speed and explosiveness during practice Tuesday with a 70-yard run. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Junior running back Curtis McNeal and redshirt freshman running back D.J. Morgan were the only tailbacks available for practice, although both were at less than 100 percent. Senior Marc Tyler missed practice with a concussion, while sophomore Dillon Baxter continued training work and did not practice.
McNeal continually ripped long runs in full-contact scrimmages behind a mostly inexperienced offensive line. Runs included a 70-yarder where senior Marshall Jones lunged and threw off McNeal’s balance just enough to force him out of bounds one yard short of the goal line.
“The catches are just telling us to run into holes when we see them,” McNeal said. “We run through the linebackers and then beat the safeties off the angles.”
Last season, McNeal was ruled ineligible to play.
“I would really like to have him eligible,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “He recovered from a busted back from Saturday and had a great day today.”
Freshman fullback Soma Vainuku, the favorite to replace the graduated Stanley Havili, showcased his skills as he ran violently through a defensive back on a long run up the sideline.
“Coming in the spring has helped a lot,” Vainuku said. “I’ve learned so much. It would have been a lot to learn if I came in the fall and had only three weeks to prepare for the first game.”

Depth has been a recurring issue for the Trojans, whether due to injury or lack of experience.
“We have a few great players, but we still have a lot of holes to fill,” Kiffin said.
Neither redshirt freshman Jesse Scroggins nor freshmen quarterbacks Max Wittek and Cody Kessler have distinguished themselves as clear options for the second quarterback spot yet.
“We hope to have a clear-cut number two by the end of the spring,” Kiffin said. “But they would really have to distance themselves. As of now, Jesse’s leading it by a little bit.”
The group split repetitions during full contact drills.
“All of the quarterbacks watch film together and Matt [Barkley] helps us out a lot,” Kessler said. “It’s awesome.”
Hitting drills have found their place on the practice field this spring after a lack of depth forced the coaching staff to make practices contact-free during the last fall.
Everybody, including the quarterbacks and kickers, had an opportunity to hit during practice. While running backs lined up against linebackers and receivers lined up against defensive backs, the quarterbacks were allowed to face off in one-on-one drills against the kickers and long snappers. Kessler started the drill with a huge hit against his opponent that elicited a loud roar from his gold-jerseyed teammates.
“We’ve been talking about this for a while and we finally got an opportunity to hit,” Kessler said. “Hopefully this can come every week.”

One stadium’s misfortune could be another stadium’s opportunity.
With less than five months until the Trojans take the field against Minnesota on Sept. 3 for their 2011 home opener, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commission and USC have a chance to create their own silver lining in the aftermath of the altercation outside of Dodger Stadium earlier this month that left 42-year-old Bryan Stow in a coma.
The commission can’t prevent a fight from happening in the stands, the parking lot or any other venue, but it can help change the culture.
Although the Coliseum hasn’t recently made news for the criminal behavior of its patrons, college football stadiums, especially here in our own backyard, are not immune to these unnecessary situations.
As recently as last season, when USC and UCLA met in Pasadena on Dec. 5 for their annual rivalry game, the evening took on a darker tone when, hours before the game began, officers were called to a tailgating area on Lot 1 of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, where 50 to 75 fans were engaged in an melee that sent two men to the hospital with stab wounds. It was so bad, one of the instigators was jailed on suspicion of attempted murder.
I understand an incident such as this or the one that took place two weeks ago at Dodger Stadium don’t have a direct connection to the Coliseum. Nonetheless, if ever there were a time to re-evaluate security plans for the coming season, this is it.
Currently, when most people think of football and its long-standing history in Southern California, the first images they conjure up are likely of the Coliseum.
It’s an athletic cathedral synonymous with the majestic pageantry of the Olympic Games, nail-biting World Series contests, Super Bowl classics and some of the most historic college football games ever played.
But with that sense of tradition comes a sense of responsibility, especially in light of these recent events.
Maybe that means putting more patrols around the parking lots surrounding the stadium, or having LAPD officers greet fans when they pass through the turnstiles, or even preventing alcohol consumption at tailgating areas which take place on Coliseum property.
There is no easy answer.
Fan altercations are not a problem you can directly blame on rivalries, lack of security or even excess amounts of alcohol.
But what we do know is the problem does exist, and although I might sound like the fun police trying to promote ideas that could take away from the carefree environment generally associated with tailgating and sporting events, drastic times call for drastic measures.
Dodgers’ owner Frank McCourt can dismiss the Opening Day incident as an isolated matter all he wants, but in reality, it’s not.
In April 2009, there was a similar episode between Dodgers and Giants fans, when an unidentified man was stabbed multiple times in the Dodger Stadium parking lot.
There are a lot of Angelenos disgusted by the recent actions of their fellow fans, and the issue can’t simply be dismissed.
Now is not the time for the Coliseum and this university to stand pat on what has worked for them in recent years.
Though increased security measures could come off as over the top to students and the local community, I say, so be it. Remaining complacent now could cost a life later.
As the saying goes: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
Let’s just hope the Coliseum gets the message, before the shame and the blame are on their hands next.
 
“For The Love Of The Game” runs Wednesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Dave at dulberg@usc.edu.
Shame and Blame for the Coliseum? These are actions of adults who use sports rivalries as an excuse to committ violent acts. the real fans rarely engage in such behaviour. This has NOTHING to do with any of the officials with any stadium. If someone wants to committ a violent act, they will regardless of what ever over the top security measure are put in place. All you can do is provide security, use cameras, and try to be as proactive as possible. Crushing the life out of the event with bans and prison camp rules wont stop those who want to committ violent acts, it will only ruin it for those of us who come to the game to watch and enjoy a good tailgate. The true key is for each fan to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings. Overraction is just a brainless approach, and blaming officials and asking them to control everyones behavior is just ridiculous at best.

The Waves hosted a “Beach Day at the Ballpark,” for USC’s matchup with Pepperdine on Tuesday afternoon, complete with beach music and a hula contest. And, just like a typical lazy day at the beach, once the sun started to set and the cool breeze turned cold, it was time to go home.
Finding his swing · Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa recorded two hits and drove in three of USC’s five runs against Pepperdine. The game, however, was postponed until further notice with the score knotted at five after the 11th inning. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
That’s because the battle between USC (13-19) and Pepperdine (15-16) was suspended after 11 innings, with the scored tied at 5-5, because of darkness. While the Waves’ home field, Eddy D. Field Stadium, has a lovely view of the ocean, it does not have lights.
There aren’t supposed to be ties in baseball. It’s said to be like kissing your sister. The Waves and Trojans didn’t have a full-on make out session, but they did have an awkward moment that will force them to resume the game at a later date. USC interim head coach Frank Cruz said the teams will finish the game when Pepperdine visits Dedeaux Field on May 24.
USC infielders Ricky Oropesa and Matt Foat were responsible for the unusual ending. With the bases loaded and no outs in the ninth inning, the junior duo tied the game with a pair of sacrifice flies against Pepperdine closer Ricky Villareal.
“We did a great job with three hits in a row from [Garret] Houts, [Kevin] Roundtree and [Joe] De Pinto to get to those guys,” Cruz said. “I’m glad they put us in that position with the ninth inning.”
In the 11th inning, Foat had an opportunity to put the Trojans ahead after Oropesa walked to put runners on first and second. But Villareal got Foat to fly out to right field to end the game. Following a 1-2-3 inning by junior reliever Ben Mount, play was suspended. It is the first time USC has had a game suspended since 2000, when the Trojans had to finish a game suspended at Loyola Marymount, also due to darkness.
“I’m much happier than losing, but I’m not as happy as winning,” Cruz said. “But we still have a chance to win this game.”
Because Mount is currently the pitcher of record, he will likely start the game when it is resumed in May.
“He threw really well with four strikeouts in three innings,” Cruz said. “That’s the most positive thing to come out of this game.”
Pepperdine took an early lead against Trojans’ junior starting pitcher Brandon Garcia when Chris Amezquita doubled down the right field line to score two runs in the first inning.
But USC immediately struck back in the next half inning. Back-to-back hits by freshman catcher Kevin Swick and sophomore outfielder J.R. Aguirre put runners on the corners for junior outfielder Garret Houts, who drove in a run with a sacrifice bunt.
After the Waves added a run to take a 3-1 lead, USC tied the game in the fifth inning when Oropesa laced a single into centerfield to score Aguirre and De Pinto.
The game stayed knotted until the eighth inning when Trojans’ freshman reliever Kyle Richter was removed from the game after throwing three solid innings. In relief, USC junior closer Chad Smith allowed back-to-back hits that scored a pair of runs, one of which was charged to Richter.
Luckily, the Trojans were able to bounce back, responding with the pair of sacrifice flies in the ninth inning that pushed the game into extra innings and the eventual suspension of play.
With a win, the Trojans would have won four of their last five games, including a conference series win against then-No. 11 Stanford during the weekend.
This weekend the Trojans will host Oregon. It will be the final three games of a 24-game stretch in which the Trojans have played all but five games at home

If you’re willing to spend $300 for a ticket to Coachella, you should at least attempt to get the most bang for your buck. For those headed to Coachella, listening to at least two songs per unknown band is always a good idea. 
Some Coachella-goers skip the headliners, allowing themselves more dancing space and a look at the underground talent few Americans know about. If Kanye, Arcade Fire, The Strokes and Kings of Leon don’t rub you the right way, consider these five indie acts:
The Black Keys
The duo of Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney should not be missed. The two first appeared as The Black Keys at Coachella just two years ago, with a mind-blowing, rock-a-licious set. The same should be expected Friday.
Since they first formed in 2001, the Keys have released six albums, and each one is worth listening to a million times over. Auerbach and Carney embrace the traditions of the American blues-rock music duo, and their latest Brothers album released last year will likely go down in history as being one of the finest of 2010. When they play “Howlin’ For You” on Friday, the crowd will no doubt be howlin’ along.
Nosaj Thing
Three words: The Sahara Tent.
For those looking to head-bob, jump and dougie, the Sahara Tent will be filled with other audio A-listers, including the Bloody Beetroots, Fedde Le Grand, Boys Noize and Afrojack. But there’s something special about Nosaj Thing (birth name Jason Chung.)
He released his first full album, Drift, in 2009, and though his preferred genre tends to be grouped into the electronic category, Nosaj Thing aims to defy expectations, mixing operatic synth sounds with heavy, grit-soaked beats in “Lords.”
Even if the slower, more intricate Chung doesn’t quite melt minds like the Chemical Brothers do, his tunes yield a transcendent music experience.
 
The Scissor Sisters
The Scissor Sisters are immensely enjoyable. The alternative band started off in New York City with their 2004 album, Scissor Sisters, winning them the best album of that year. Bono recently called them his favorite pop group in the world.
Their most popular song “I Don’t Feel Like Dancing” from their Ta-Dah album released in September 2006. The Scissor Sisters’ music resembles Ska, but is not as annoying as Ska can be. They’re a trippy bunch comprised of five members, and will absolutely bring an ’80s mix feel to the Coachella family.
Erykah Badu
Similar to Lauyrn Hill or Billie Holiday, Badu accompanies her rasta-like highly wanted afro mane with a smooth and sexy voice. Not only is she an American recording artist, but she is also a record producer and actress who has appeared on the sitcom Girlfriends.
Her sensual sounds have won her the title of “First Lady of Neo-Soul” or the “Queen of Neo-Soul.” When she sings, you will feel chills. Badu is one of those talented artists who doesn’t produce synthetic-sounding pieces. She is a vessel of authenticity, and her music truly amplifies her sexy vibes.
Omar Rodriguez Lopez
Someone you might call an interesting dude, Lopez is the arguable master of the progressive rock-psychedelic, rock-experimental-electronic-freaky genre.
He is best known as the guitarist, producer and composer for The Mars Volta, but Lopez and his guitar kick ass alone.
Though there might be no Hendrix of this generation, inevitable jaw drops come when listening to Lopez.
His first solo album came in 2005 titled Omar Rodriguez Lopez Quintet, but at the end of 2009, Lopez released three more albums titled Los Sueños de un Hígado, Xenophanes and Solar Gambling.
!!!
This dance-punk indie band — it’s pronounced “chk chk chk” — knows how to have fun, and how to keep it casual. The group has rotated and changed members many times, but it has stayed consistent with its pure sounds. Vocalist Nic Offer sometimes  sharpens his voice with “All my Heroes are Weirdos,” and then later sexify them in “Myth Takes.”
Their most recent album, Strange Weather, Isn’t It?, released in August 2009, isn’t as good as their Myth Takes album, but they’re still a funky bunch. You’ll want more, and you’ll groove your way through their beats.

Thursday night. You’ve pulled the tent out of mothballs, tackled those term papers a week early and assembled a playlist that includes Lauryn Hill, Sven Väth and that song about Barbara Streisand.
“I’m ready,” you think.
Ready to hit the highway, slather on the sunscreen and lose your best pair of wayfarers at this year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
Not so fast. Preparing for a kick in the head from Alice Glass is one matter, but adequately stocking up for the elemental experience of America’s most legendary music festival is nothing to be taken lightly. Whether you’re renting a house or attempting a night’s sleep in the bustling campgrounds, poor planning and few provisions can make for a miserable experience under the boiling Indio sun.
To avoid heatstroke, disco dehydration and other maladies, set an hour aside and hit the nearest Ralph’s for these Coachella essentials.
—
Sunblock
If you’ve got one tube already, invest in another. Not only will you avoid the festival general store’s appalling prices, but you’ll have your choice of sun protection factor levels. At Coachella, anything below 30 SPF is borderline negligible. Even if you tan like an Oxford shoe, too much UV exposure in the desert will make squeezing toward the barrier for Broken Social Scene a needlessly painful experience.
—
Clif Bars
Sure, Coachella offers food of a higher grade than most festivals, but those gourmet pizza slices and sukiyaki bowls add up faster than a Hong Kong hedge fund. Clif Bars make for a tasty, cheap, sustaining snack and are ideal for the hours before the festival gates open each day. Many supermarkets offer them for less than $2 apiece, so grab a bushel before you go.

I steal music. Most people reading this probably do too. I’m not saying it’s right, but I rarely feel guilty.
Much of my generation has fallen into the easy routine of downloading music for free. As a result, record release dates mean nothing, as albums leak weeks in advance.
Yet while the Recording Industry Association of America continues its impossible war against internet “pirates,” others are looking to save the recording industry in a more constructive manner.
Last month, Jack White of the White Stripes debuted his Third Man Rolling Record Store, a sort of food truck but with vinyl, at SXSW. And this Saturday is Record Store Day, a collaborative effort intended to promote independent record stores. Amoeba Music in Hollywood has already sold out tickets for a CD signing featuring Slash. Bands are issuing limited-edition releases for the day, and there will be numerous in-store performances as well.
I always dismissed vinyl supporters as either pretentious hipsters or people afraid to face the future. The arrogant dude rifling through Goodwill’s dusty record bins always irked me.
Then, slowly, I became that guy. My favorite albums are more than 10 years old, and most were released in the pre-iTunes era. I have CD copies of all of them.
This is how those who grew up with vinyl must feel. Music consumption has changed, seemingly for the better, but there’s always something special about the way things used to be done.
I grew up listening to CDs. But now the times they are a-changin’, and it’s fitting I learned that reference from an mp3 Bob Dylan album rather than the real thing.
CDs were much more effective at sustaining people’s interest in albums because they forced you to pay money for a tangible product. They forced you to actively seek out music and to listen to that music as much as possible to get your money’s worth, since you paid for an entire album, not just an iTunes track.
They forced you to read the lyrics sheet on the inside cover and learn all of the words.
The reason my favorite albums were all released in the CD heyday is because that format forced me to invest my time and money in one specific product.
But ever since Napster launched, I’ve been downloading music, and as technology further developed I began downloading complete albums. Those albums would sit on my computer for days, weeks or years at a time, unnoticed or forgotten. Even albums I purchased on iTunes would get lost somewhere in the depths of my digital storage.
To indulge my CD nostalgia and force myself to start truly enjoying music again, I recently bought a record player, albeit a cheap one, from Amazon that plugs into my computer speakers. I did it to force myself to actually appreciate the art of the LP album again.
As much as I used to hate record collectors for ignorantly resisting the benefits of digital music distribution, I understand them now. I’ve fallen in love with the drop of the needle, the static sound you sometimes hear, the fact that records need careful cleaning and storage.
I’m now the pretentious idiot digging through crates of records, and I’m not ashamed to admit it.
Anyone who thinks analog and digital music are mutually exclusive is entirely mistaken. In fact, most new vinyl LPs come with a code for an mp3 download of the album.
Even in the recording world, many albums are recorded and mixed first on an analog system, then tweaked on a digital program that offers almost limitless possibilities.
Just because I’m going to start spending more time in record stores doesn’t mean I will stop listening to music on my computer or iPod. Digging through crates of records to find a new artist or album is more fun, but digging through the Internet for new music is more effective.
I understand the reasons why people like Jack White and those behind Record Store Day list vinyl as their preferred method of buying music.
Records force you to invest in an album both monetarily and emotionally, and to listen to the album often, just like I used to do with CDs.
I’m still going to steal some music, but I’m going to put more effort into paying for, and enjoying it, too.

Will Hagle, for a clueless dweeb who relishes his freedom to steal music with impunity, thus disregarding the artists as well as the law, you certainly like to talk about being “forced” to do things. Hell, you managed to use “forced” or “force” seven times in this short, pathetic article, mostly to describe situations in which one may be *tempted* or *encouraged* to do something, but not “forced”. Perhaps you can also steal a thesaurus in order to expand your choice of words. 
Music thieves are a contributing factor to the overwhelmingly crappy music scene: you certainly don’t place any value on music if you freely steal and distribute it. Who cares if artists have to expend time, money, and effort to produce a recording? To you, it’s “just music” and should be free for the taking. No wonder so much of the music dominating pop culture today is lame and uninspiring. Like Andy Partridge wrote in XTC’s “Funk Pop A Roll”: “Everything you eat is waste / but swallowing is easy when it’s got no taste.”
The old saying goes, “You get what you pay for,” but in your case, you don’t even pay for it.

Gorillaz’s latest album, The Fall, is an oddity, but an enjoyable oddity.
Recorded using an iPad during the band’s Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour, the album is a shift in style for the group.
But in it, the band has done the seemingly impossible: It has produced an electronic album entirely on the road.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
Gorillaz’s first album had a strong alternative hip-hop sound, but slowly the band has moved to a more pop overtone.
The samples, beats and guest rappers are still there, but Plastic Beach was bubblegum-like in its pop sensibilities. With The Fall, Gorillaz take a dramatic step away from that pop sound, creating a mix of electronica and ambient music.
By eschewing its pop sound, Gorillaz has embraced a minimalistic feel.
Instead of rapid-fire beats and a roller coaster of highs and lows, The Fall is very much a calm river. Each song simply flows without any big distortions in pace or tempo changes.
Oddly enough, this is experimental for the band; it’s much more electronic than previous albums. Vocals take a backseat to the music, and the computer effects dominate the tracks, throwing a wide range of sounds and samples over the more rhythmic elements.
The album, which was recorded on the road, is a reflection on the nature of travel.
The tracks are immersive and reflective, drawing listeners in and letting them get lost in the relaxing, somber music.
Each song on The Fall follows this languid mood, offering slightly hypnotic pictures of the American road through the band’s eyes.
The lyrical imagery in The Fall helps this reflective mode continue, with songs like “Little Pink Plastic Bags” crafting the image of an empty highway with aimless souls wandering off into the sunset.
There’s a strong sense of exhaustion and futility in the track, as if frontman Damon Albarn was worn out by the U.S. tour while he was recording it.
Even when Albarn’s vocals take center stage in songs such as “Revolving Doors,” the track as a whole is more cyclical and repetitive in content, matching the pulsing music instead of going for a linear verse-chorus-verse progression.
Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and other cities are name-dropped, but in a random order, conveying the constantly changing locations Gorillaz must adapt to as it  tours the country.
There are moments where Gorillaz throws in sounds that mirror the changing landscapes of the album. “Aspen Forest” has a more European-house feel, while “Revolving Doors” and the opening track “Phoner to Arizona” have a sparse, desert-like tone.
The most prominent stylistic touch in The Fall is the use of radio chatter and static cutting between songs or overlaid on top of them.
Random songs or talk radio segments float between the tracks, emphasizing the album was produced on a road trip, not in a studio.
The radio chatter blends perfectly into “The Parish of Space Dust,” a country-sampling song with a slow build that lets the listener get lost amid the static.
Then there’s the Bobby Womack collaboration, “Bobby in Phoenix.”
On the surface, it’s an R&B-tinged love song driven by Womacks’ soulful vocals.
But put into the context of the rest of the album, the breezy track’s mellow chords and vocals bring to mind an end-of-the-road vibe, helping to wind The Fall down as it gets near its end, shifting seamlessly into “California and the Slipping of the Sun.”
The Fall isn’t an album likely to get heavy radio play or fit the more dance-oriented sound Gorillaz has developed in its traditional studio records.
But the band manages to blend its genre-crossing approach with a usually low-key sound.
And through that, The Fall is the perfect record to listen to while driving across the country.

Augusta National Golf Club prides itself on a deep sense of tradition. Amen Corner, the Green Jacket, Jim Nantz one-liners — they are all part of the Masters lore.
Another part of that Masters tradition is exclusivity — but last Sunday, that exclusivity was taken too far.
Jovanna Tosello| Daily Trojan
The Bergen Record’s Tara Sullivan was attempting to enter the locker room to talk to Rory McIlroy after his monumental collapse during Sunday’s final round when she was apprehended by a female security guard who told Sullivan she was not allowed in — because she was a woman.
Sullivan immediately tweeted about the incident: “Bad enough no women members at Augusta. But not allowing me to join writers in locker room interview is just wrong.”
This was met, and rightfully so, with widespread outrage. Augusta National immediately issued an apology, claiming the security guard was a temporary employee who did not adequately understand the rules and policies of the club.
If we take Augusta at its word, it makes Payne and the club look a little better — but not by much.
That there was any confusion about a potential club policy of barring women from the locker room in the first place demonstrates the need for major change at Augusta.
There should be no possibility for such confusion at any major golf tournament, let alone the premier event for the sport.
Augusta needs a major overhaul — specifically adding its first woman member — to do the necessary damage control.
The club has survived prior gender discrimination controversies. In June 2002, Martha Burk, chair of the National Council of Women’s Organizations, called for Augusta National to admit women as full members. Supporters of female members even went as far as to request some professionals to boycott the 2003 Masters.
Augusta now needs to step into the modern age.
Although adding women will anger the more traditional country club members, Chairman Bill Payne should still sacrifice his approval rating from those members to boost his approval rating from the public.
This latest incident has been picked up by most major media outlets and will continue to haunt Augusta until action is taken.
What happened at Augusta is an issue of refusing equal access; it is an issue of golf’s landmark event being openly and forcefully misogynistic.
Misogyny is an accepted theme of Augusta, and it’s something that simply cannot be tolerated any longer. Confusion about allowing a woman in the locker room 20 years ago? Wrong, but understandable. Confusion in 2011? Not at all.
Instead of Charl Schwartzel’s improbable victory, McIlroy’s momentous collapse or even Tiger Woods remarkable front nine, the dominant story emerging from this year’s Masters is Tara Sullivan’s rejection.
The event, meant to be the sport’s finest moment, ended up being one of its ugliest in recent history.
Hopefully by this time next year, the confusion won’t get in the way of a woman just trying to do her job — golf fans can only tolerate so much.
 
Cyrus Behzadi is a freshman majoring in communication. His column, “The Extra Point,” runs Wednesdays.
This article is written by a total loser. Augusta has every right not to admit women. They survived an attack from a femi nazi like Doris Burk and they will survive one from a wimp who wrote this article. As an alumnus I can see the culture of the DT has not changed  one bit.
Rich and Greg, women are in fact allowed in men’s locker rooms…read up sons…ramona shelburne of ESPNLA is in the Clippers locker room after every game…
“the dominant story emerging from this year’s Masters is Tara Sullivan’s rejection”
Are you serious??
I had not heard about this story until I read about it here on the DT.  Augusta is a private golf club, and therefore has the right to restrict women from the men’s locker room, and with that said, the club came out and apologized for the incident.
The dominant story from this years Masters will be Tiger Woods because his putting and swing was amazing on the front 9, and when he gets that nailed down, he will be unstoppable yet again (hopefully).
Bill Payne serves for Augusta, not for public.
this is a stupid article. Are men allowed in Womens locker rooms…NO. Enough said.
Some traditions are worth keeping. Some things are better left off the television. Locker room interviews -. is there anything worth repeating from one of those interviews?
Women, like men, do not belong in each other’s locker room.  You can interview players afterwards.

The debate between faith and science is no longer black and white.
That notion became clear last Thursday when USC hosted John Lennox, a professor of mathematics at the University of Oxford, as part of a Veritas Forum discussion. These discussions, which are a series of events that bring together students and faculty, discuss questions of faith and its relevance to our daily lives.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Though many believe faith and science are incompatible, Lennox said he believes God created the universe, not despite the evidence, but because of the evidence.
Scientific evidence has led many to conclude there is no God. Yet, the same evidence has also led scientists to conclude there has to be a God, or more specifically, some sort of rational mind behind the creation of the universe.
In a debate with former Oxford professor Peter Atkins, a prominent chemist and self-proclaimed atheist, Lennox said, “God is an agent who causes the universe to exist. Science explains mechanisms, and the existence of mechanisms certainly doesn’t provide an argument — to my mind — for the absence of an agent who designed the mechanisms.”
Peter Atkins has said before a scientist who believes in God is “only half a scientist.”
But for Lennox, there is no dichotomy between science and God. The two, he insists, can coexist without sacrificing the objectivity of the scientific method or forcing scientists to abandon their belief that water once turned into wine.
Still, the false dilemma — faith in religion or faith in science — continues to circulate.
The battle isn’t between religion and science; it’s between two interpretations of the same scientific evidence.
Peter Atkins has said before that a scientist who believes in God is “only half a scientist,” and academia generally shares this disdain.
Rhetoric like this has overshadowed the arguments scientists like Lennox present, which are grounded in evidence, not blind ideology.
Look at how academia has stonewalled the intelligent design theory, which holds that the origin of man is best explained by intelligent cause, as opposed to  natural selection.
It’s not because those who propagate intelligent design lack scientific evidence. On the contrary, scientists like Stephen Meyer of the Discovery Institute base the intelligent design theory on cutting-edge biological science, looking at the digital code and other properties of DNA and RNA.
Scientists say this evidence fundamentally challenges materialistic theories of life’s origin.
In one such article, “The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories,”  Meyer argues no current materialistic theory of evolution can explain the origin of the information necessary to create humans.
Meyer, therefore, offers intelligent design as an alternative explanation for the origin of biological information.
Meyer’s conclusion is based on objective evidence, not on religious motivation, although religious implications logically follow.
The intelligent design theory is propagated by men and women who are not in any way sub-par scientists or small-minded. Yet academia still refuses to credit their work.
Science has been glorified as an objective way to examine the universe.
The aggression and vigilance with which academia tries to discredit those who incorporate God into science or epistemology is not based on objective consideration of the evidence.
Instead, scientists with no religious background might often jump to conclusions without considering the contributions faith can make in the fields of science and technology.
Before condemning scientists that incorporate religion into their field of study, perhaps leading academia can make an effort to understand the connection between faith and science — a continuously  intertwined relationship in today’s age.
 
Jordan Lee is a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and Chinese.
This article should have been written two weeks ago on April Fool’s Day. Surely a USC student can’t be so ignorant as to think that intelligent design actually happened.
I personally don’t believe in religion but I do believe in a higher power for the reason of our existence… as for the reason we were put here, can only be answered by science and NOT by believing in [a] superstitious being(s)!
Articles like this religious fluff piece is just an updated, modernized version of dissertations hundreds of years ago that claimed the existence of witches, moral obligation of virgin sacrifices and insistence the sun revolves around the earth. Over time the religious merely has to update their positions in the face of overwhelming scientific facts or else even they would have to admit they have become irrelevant. The article starts out by stating “The debate between faith and science is no longer black and white.” Really? If that one event has now convinced you that we live in a universe where the supernatural exists then your credulity is shameful.
BTW, does the religious not find it amazing how there are so many “brands” of religion that are incompatible with each other. Often times you will witness more fierce opposition from self proclaimed religious people with other self proclaimed religious people. The debate is they believe THEIR God is the “real” god. Are we really still such superstitious natives? Isn’t it also amazing that these brands of Gods also happen to fall along boundaries on a map that often times are man made? Sort of makes you wonder if the creation of God is man made as well.
Because Science time and time again in history has made past religious beliefs simply look foolish, the best religion can do now is claim a draw or say the discussion between religion and science is not black and white. The best they can hope for is inserting some fuzzy logic into the discourse. BTW, for every John McCain and Sarah Palin who sees the hand of god in the majestic Grand Canyon, do they also admit they see the hand of God in Hurricane Katrina or tsunamis in Japan? Or is this part of god tempered by the platitude of his “mysterious ways”? Yeah, mysterious as in seems like he doesn’t exist.
What is wrong with simply saying there are things in the world that we do know or understand yet? Isn’t that the beauty of science? If we admit what we don’t know and not pretend to know things we can NOT yet know – that is the first step in the pursuit of discovery. The religious is starting off by saying they know how it all started so therefore no need for more answers – their bible explains it all in Genesis. If we left the world up to the religious, we would still be dying of polio and clasping our hands in prayer as a valid medical remedy. 
I would love to know WHO’s god Lennox thinks “is an agent who causes the universe to exist…” Seems when it comes to religion there are numerous Almighties to choose from. Imagine building a skyscraper, bridge or airplane based on one’s own personal theory of physics and engineering. And imagine the only rationale offered is that – well this is what I truly believe. And also imagine if challenging that “personal” methodology of building airplanes and structures was met with horrified, deeply offended people looking for protection under our stupefying, politically over-correct society? When stuff really matters, we fall back on science – when we have the luxury of make-believe unicorn dust that just makes us feel better, we have religion.
While I have a decided opinion about this topic that I could discuss at length, I would rather point out some of the issues I have with the structure of this article.  If you are writing an opinion piece, especially one aimed at a scientific audience, there are certain things that need to be considered and addressed.  They are as follows, in no particular order:
1. Strong evidence.
2. Multiple credible sources.
3. Persuasive writing.
As for 1 and 2, this article is sadly lacking.  The only evidence cited is one article written by a person who would not be considered credible to scientists.  Stating that an article (like the one written by Mr. Meyer) is an objective look at scientific evidence when it is written by someone employed by a political think-tank is just not correct.  Political think-tanks have agendas; that is their reason for existing–to further an agenda.  That means they approach things from an inherently biased standpoint.  When Mr. Meyer looked at the body of evidence, he did so through intelligent design goggles.  Obviously, he would see what he wanted to see.  Furthermore, for a source to be credible, I would expect them to be an expert in their field.  However, Mr. Meyer has a degree in the history of science, and has done research in geology.  As such, I would not consider his commentary on biological sciences to be of high quality.
When it comes to 3 (which would be a result of 1 and 2), I’m really disappointed.  I’m personally fascinated with this kind of debate, but statements made by proponents of faith tend to lack any convincing support.  Just stating that there are real scientists out there who have found support for intelligent design does nothing to convince anyone of anything.  What are their names?  Who are they working for?  Where can I read their published articles?
Finally, I am really bothered by the statement about the “aggression” and “vigilance” of scientists.  The goal of science is to discover the truth, whatever that may be.  That means that new ideas are subjected to scrutiny from the scientific community.  If these ideas are found lacking in sufficient evidence or logic, they are rejected.  This provides for a system where the body of information that survives this process can be considered to be taken as fact (which distinctly separates scientific theories from things taken on faith).  This doesn’t mean that all ideas that are initially rejected are wrong; it just means that scientists need to keep working, get better data, and resubmit their theories.  So this vigilance, that is portrayed in a negative light in this article, is really a reflection of the passion of scientists to know how the natural world actually works.  If scientists find enough evidence that supports intelligent design, then it will be adopted as fact by the scientific community.  Until then, it will be criticized with the same rigor as any other theory that lacks sufficient proof.
I guess that’s it.  Keep up the debate!
The point is scientists who believe in God or gods, like Francis Ayala, MUST leave God or gods out of their science.
Science is all about the natural world.  The supernatural world is, by definition, not measurable by science.  Science can have no opinion on that which it cannot submit to the scientific method.  (ID invokes supernatural phenomena, hence, it is not science and is rightly regarded as out-of-bounds in science, despite the ID supporters persistent denial that this is what they are invoking.  It was also thoroughly vetted by scientists in the 19th century and determined to be unscientific. For a respectful discussion of ID among scientists, see letters between Charles Darwin and Asa Gray.)
When it comes to science, scientists who maintain a religious faith must reason and publish as scientists, completely leaving God or gods out.
What they do in their personal lives, on Saturday or Sunday or Friday nights or during the festival of Holi, is up to them.
This is a wonderfully written piece about an often overlooked and ridiculed part of the debate.
While this author is quite clearly biased, he is neither demeaning nor unnecessarily condescending, choosing rather to submit his opinion with a few reasons he holds to such.  Sadly, as representation of the opposing view, we have condescending arrogance which is supposed to somehow cow and embarrass the other side into silence, exactly what was being pointed out in this article (as if the author needed more proof of this dogmatic attitude).  How sad that such juvenile, playground-esque bullying and moronic name-calling is sometimes effective.  It is possible, I have seen in the past, to think someone’s ideas are without merit without being dismissive of their ability to reason, however that would require that facts are employed and thought is required.  Is it truly too much to request?  Have Darwinists truly evolved so little from their ape-ish ancestors that such things are an impossibility and they must resort to the verbal equivalent of throwing feces?
(For ARL, since you were more reasonable than your peers: for the record, a theistic scientist must, as a rule, begin at a God, therefore said person must believe in a sort of intelligent design, whether or not it would be called such.  Anyone who does not yet still claims the title of theistic scientist or even the belief in God is clearly lying to the world and possibly himself.)
Oils, I meant Jordan. Sorry for getting yourname wrong!
First of all, I want to echo Anon and applaud you Jonathan for being courageous enough to write this article. I love that this country values the importance of free speech, and the importance of agreeing to disagree.
 Let me say this first, I have no intention to bash either sides. Alhough the arguments made by the Intelligent Design “theory” are reasonable, in my opinion, it’s very difficult to count it as a scientific theory–especially since it cannot be tested or observed directly. On the same note, this is also true for the theory of macroevolution, so your argument is kind of valid, the majority of the scientific academia is, ironically, not impartial on faith-related issues. 
I am a science major at USC, and I’m one of the people who believe science and faith are not exclusive. But with that said, faith is not, and never will be, science. And it shouldn’t be, because faith is exactly that: believing without seeing. And science is about using observations and tests to explain how things work they way they do, not who made them work. I personally believe that science is a gift from God and a tool he gave us to understand our surroundings and appreciate his creations. I love studying and using these tools but I would never try to prove his existence with them.
So in short, while it’s a tragedy that atheistic and theistic scientists can’t come around to respect and understand each other, it’s just doesn’t make sense, in my opinion, to try to prove faith with science.
Could not agree more. Thanks! Nice to see not all scientists are out to bash those with faith. One cannot explain the other by mere definition, but that doesn’t mean one person cannot “believe” in both science and religion. I’ve met too many atheists who are quick to denounce what they don’t understand, and I wish there were more open-minded people like you out there, Monica!
I’m glad someone was courageous enough to write this article. Thank you Jordan Lee for giving credence to those who are continually silenced in today’s schizophrenically atheistic academia.
The very virulence with which anyone is attacked when they posit the existence of a Designer does seem to indicate at least a modicum of fear on the part of those who refuse to consider said existence. How very narrow-minded.
“Before condemning scientists that incorporate religion into their field of study, perhaps leading academia can make an effort to understand the connection between faith and science — a continuously  intertwined relationship in today’s age.”
Wow mister. Scientists don’t incorporate religion into anything.
“Jordan Lee is a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and Chinese.”
Mr. Lee, why do you think your worthless journalism and chinese make you qualified to say anything about science? You don’t even know what science is. Learn how to shut up what you know nothing about, unless you enjoy being ridiculed.
Personal attacks really give you an edge there, ape. 
Clearly you know nothing about THE WORLD if you think a journalism degree is worthless. Lee and anyone else with a degree in journalism is probably more well-versed in a much wider range of topics than you’ll ever be, including politics, crime, economics, history, philanthropy, sociology, and yes, even math and science. That’s the magic of journalism: you learn about everything. 
And this article is very well-thought out and uses amazingly credible sources, so Lee isn’t just pulling this stuff out of his arse. Thank you Jordan for saying what so many of us were already thinking and for doing it so eloquently!
As for you ape, “Scientists don’t incorporate religion into anything.” Seriously? DID YOU NOT READ THE ARTICLE? Unless you don’t consider an Oxford science professor and atheist a scientist. Get your head out of your own arse and learn to read. The whole point of this article was to show that science can take religion into account, and as an educated Catholic, I can say a lot of religion takes science into account. We’re not living in Biblic times anymore. Welcome to the 21st century.
Firstly, the name Jordan can either refer to a male or female. Secondly, a person shouldn’t criticize someone who they know hardly anything about. That would be judging… though I suppose everyone does that. Is it good? No.
“theistic scientist”
There are no theistic scientists. There is no theism in science. If some tard invokes theism he’s a Bible thumper, not a scientist.
Wow, such bitterness. You just proved yourself an a-hole.
Faith = insanity. That sounds about right. I do not see science in this equation!
You sounded like perfectly reasonable theistic scientist until you got to so-called “intelligent design.”
A theistic scientist believes in God or gods, but does not reject evidence that disagrees with dogma.  Such a scientist recognizes that you cannot put God or gods in a test tube.
Although a religious scientist might intuit a designer as a matter of personal belief, he or she would never suggest that such a position has scientific validity or support.
There is no evidence that any disinterested observer would agree proves a designer.
ID It’s not science, period.

Penélope Cruz will reunite with Woody Allen on his upcoming project, which is scheduled to start production this summer in Rome.
In 2009, Penélope Cruz won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in Vicky Cristina Barcelona under Woody Allen’s direction.
In an exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly, the actress said, “I know [what I’m doing next], but the thing is that I have to ask the director what I can say and what I cannot say. Because he’s very secretive. It’s…it’s a movie with Woody Allen. But I really cannot say anything about the story or the characters.”
Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris along with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which will star Penélope Cruz, are both scheduled for release on May 20.

Florida-based nu-metal band Limp Bizkit is finally ready to release its new album, Gold Cobra, June 28 on Interscope Records. After much anticipation and extensive recording, the band has fully reunited for the first time since 2001.
Rumors have been circulating about the release since mid-2008 when each band member created an official Twitter account, including the beloved guitarist Wes Borland who had left the band for the second time in 2005.
In early 2009, the band’s website reappeared with a joint statement from vocalist Fred Durst and Borland announcing the full return of Limp Bizkit and a new album in the works.
The band entered the studio in August of that year and Durst kept fans posted on Twitter about the progress of the record. On March 14 and 18, Durst posted a video on Twitter proclaiming that the mixing had been completed and the album was ready to be pressed. He also declared that the record label wanted to release a standard edition of the record with 8 tracks and a deluxe edition that would include 11 tracks. The official tracklist has not yet been confirmed, though.
Another interesting piece of information in the video was when Durst declared that they had so many songs recorded that not all of them would make the release of Gold Cobra and instead would be released on follow-up album to be released sometime in the near future.
Limp Bizkit’s last release, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1), featured Borland on guitar (he left the band soon after its release) but was without drummer John Otto. Gold Cobra will feature both Otto and Borland in addition to the other three original members of the band, and will mark their first release together since 2001’s The Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. Limp Bizkit will be touring overseas throughout the summer and fans can expect a tour of the United States soon after.
So far, they have released two full songs from the upcoming record entitled “Why Try” and “Walking Away.”
