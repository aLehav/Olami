The MPSF Conference recognized outstanding performances from two Women of Troy this week, as senior water polo driver Monica Vavic and junior lacrosse midfielder Amanda Johansen were commemorated with weekly awards for their exceptional athletic work during the first week of April.
On the road against the No. 4 ranked Cal, Vavic came up huge for the No. 3-ranked Women of Troy, scoring three of a game-high four goals in the match during the final period to lead USC to a nailbiting 6-5 comeback victory.
Trailing 4-2 and in danger of being upset by the Bears, USC got a late third-frame goal from freshman driver Brianna Daboub before Vavic took over the game in the fourth. After scoring the equalizer with four minutes 56 seconds left in the match, Vavic put home the go-ahead goal just 54 seconds later with four minutes two seconds remaining after capitalizing on a 5-meter penalty shot. She would later ice the comeback win with just over a minute remaining, on a win-clinching dagger that put USC up 6-4 en route to the one-goal victory. Vavic also added three steals and two ejections drawn on the day, helping her earn the MPSF water polo Player of the Week honor.
The weekly award marks the third of the season for Vavic and the sixth of her illustrious career at USC. Her four goals Saturday pulled her into a tie for third-most all-time career goals in MPSF history (273), and placed her alone in second place for most goals during one season in USC history (82). Vavic’s contributions have helped the  No. 3-ranked Women of Troy to a 20-2 record overall, 3-1 in conference play.
Though Vavic was tearing through Berkeley’s fourth-period defense, Johansen was busy stuffing the stat sheet for the USC women’s lacrosse team during two tough road matchups. In a hard-fought 16-12 loss to then-No. 2-ranked Boston College in Newton, Massachusetts, on March 30, Johansen scored four goals of her own while picking up two ground balls and winning two draw controls.
Then, in a 13-11 victory this past Friday against Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, Johansen played an even more all-around game, dishing three assists to go with a goal, five draw control wins, two collected ground balls, and two caused turnovers. Her combined efforts earned her the MPSF Offensive Player of the Week award, the third such award of the season for the Women of Troy. Junior attacker Cara de Lyra won the award on Feb. 9 before sophomore midfielder Kylie Drexel was honored on March 16.
The offensive accolade is the first of Johansen’s career, adding to an impressive resume that began her freshman year in 2013 when she won Rookie of the Week honors three different times. Johansen’s efforts last week continued what has been an immensely successful season for her, as she currently sits in third place on the team’s season points leaderboard with 27 goals and six assists, and also boasts 35 draw controls, 14 ground ball pickups, and nine caused turnovers. She is tied for third-best or better on the team in each category.
Johansen has helped the USC lacrosse team to an impressive 8-3 record and 4-0 conference mark thus far. The team next takes the field this Friday at home versus Colorado before hosting Denver for their final home regular season game of the year on Sunday. USC will then play three road conference games to close out the season before MPSF Tournament play begins on April 30 in Denver, Colorado.
Vavic, meanwhile, will be honored at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday during a Senior Day ceremony, as the USC women’s water polo team plays its final home match of the year against San Jose State. The team will conclude its regular season the following Saturday across town against UCLA before heading to Tempe, Arizona, for the MPSF Championships beginning on April 24.

USC Gould School of Law hosted Darrell Steinberg, former California State Senate President pro tempore, on Tuesday evening. Steinberg’s lecture, one of the lectures within the Allen Neiman & Alan Sieroty Lecture in Civil Liberties series, addressed the attitude towards mental health disorders in the state of California.
Steinberg started by talking about how during his time in the State Senate, he strived to emulate the kind of legislature authored by one of lecture series namesake, Alan Sieroty, a California senator who retired from the state legislature in 1982.
“I [wanted to] do it for the right reasons, to serve the public, to actually get something done,” Steinberg said. “I don’t quite understand what goes on in Washington, D.C. I understand the partisanship. I do and there’s a place for partisanship. But I don’t understand when partisanship is not translated into product — the product of principle compromise.”
Steinberg asserted that the United States is at the beginning of another great chapter of the country’s struggle for civil rights and civil liberties.
“It’s time that we bring mental illness out of the closet,” Steinberg said. “It is time we stop locking up so many people whose untreated mental illnesses landed them in trouble. It’s time we end the tragic truth that the single largest mental health facility remains the Los Angeles County Jail. It is time to end the belief that mental illness must mean a life sentence of hopelessness, disconnection, unemployment and dysfunction. And it is high time to fulfill a long-held promise.”
He also read several statistics that showed that population reduction in hospitals has coincided with an increase in the prison and jail population over the last four decades. Steinberg argued that people do not get better in prison and that the overwhelming number of people with untreated mental disorders who are put in prison demonstrates the unfortunate lack of proper treatment.
Steinberg also discussed some of the side effects of the absence of mental health care such as a vastly large homeless population, thousands of returning veterans not properly diagnosed and adults not amenable to treatment living with their elderly parents.
He argued that the current system has too many trap doors where people and families do not know where to turn for help. Steinberg said that California has started transforming the system, however, by passing a ballot initiative to fund mental health. He said that this would require a movement from a fail-first system to one focused on recovery, clients and culturally competent services.
Steinberg mentioned three indisputable facts about untreated mental health. He first explained that the issue is pervasive without artificial boundaries. Second, he said that the issue affects most of the public policy issues that the government is called upon to address. Finally, he explained that there are not enough leaders in high positions who have made this problem a state or national priority.
“Our mission must be to eliminate that chasm between that which affects so many and its absence as a political, legislative and funding priority,” Steinberg said.
In addition to hearing personal stories from people in prominent positions, he believes in the creation of a political movement in which new leadership bent on making mental healthcare a priority is cultivated.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry sent an email invitation to the student body to take the Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct last week. The 20-30 minute survey aims to collect student opinions that will be factored into shaping safety policies, prevention education programming, and law enforcement measures.
A few incentives exist to encourage participation: 6,000 students will be offered a $5 Amazon gift card for completing the survey, and students who were not selected for the gift card are entered into a lottery to win a $500 prize by visiting the website. Two students will then be selected for two $500 prizes.
The Association of American Universities, a national association of 62 research universities in the United States and Canada, is leading the survey initiative.
The organization partnered with the research firm Westat, to design and deliver the survey to its member universities. Barry Toiv, the vice president for public affairs at AAU, said administrators’ desire to gather more information about student attitudes and opinions about sexual assault that prompted the development of such a survey.
“AAU took this on and [we] have never done this before,” Toiv said. “AAU entered into an agreement with Westat because Westat is one of the top private research firms in the country. They brought in expertise specifically with respect to sexual assault, which is of course very sensitive and complex so it requires a certain expertise to do right. A committee of faculty and university administrators who worked in student life was put together from different universities in the nation to work with Westat to develop the survey.”
Carry hopes that the administration can learn how to improve existing programs or introduce new initiatives based on the information the survey reveals. The questions in the survey are tailored to specifically gauge information regarding student awareness of the resources on campus and prevalence of sexual misconduct incidents.
“There’s been a discussion about colleges and universities understanding the climate on their campus related to sexual misconduct. I think the most effective way to do that is to ask students: what’s working and what’s not working, do you have access to resources, are you aware of the resources, and have you had an experience related to sexual misconduct?” Carry said. “It’ll be helpful for me to understand what do students know and what do they don’t know so we can retarget our marketing efforts.”
Carry said 28 of the 62 universities in AAU have decided to take part in the survey. To keep certain factors standardized, all universities participating are offering the same incentives to their respective students.
“By joining this national effort, we will have results from almost 30 institutions of higher education. We [will] get a chance to compare and look at opportunities for growth,” Carry said.
Though Carry said that a good turnout for such a large-scale survey is typically 15 percent to 20 percent of the student body, Carry’s personal hope is for all students to participate so the sample size of students can be as large as possible. As for the future, Carry foresees releasing a survey like this one every two or three years to measure the results of enacted programs.
Kaitlyn Hittelman, a junior majoring in international relations (global business), is currently studying abroad in Turkey; however, she is familiar with the survey from her work last semester as the co-chair of the Greek Sexual Assault Task Force.
“From my discussions with the Title IX office, I know that they are really interested in getting student feedback and making as many changes as necessary to make everyone feel safe on campus,” Hittelman said. “I would hope that they would be able to better structure their sexual assault prevention and bystander intervention programming to better fit the needs of the campus based on the results of the survey, to see where it seems that students are lacking in knowledge or in comfort.”
Vanessa Diaz, a sophomore majoring in American studies and the assistant director of Women’s Student Assembly, weighed the benefits and flaws the survey has for documenting the number of sexual assault incidences that may have otherwise gone unaccounted for in the statistics.
“A lot of people who experience sexual assault don’t report it because it’s an invasive process that is time-consuming and often do not result in favorable outcomes. People may feel more comfortable doing so in an online survey. However, the survey is also problematic because it too asks invasive questions that trigger traumatic memories,” Diaz said.
In the case of the latter, Diaz hopes that the administration allocate more resources to the Title IX office in terms of funds and training.
Students can find the invitation to take the Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct survey in their email. The survey will close on April 22.

Abiding by a new California state mandated water restriction, USC will look to take innovative approaches to further cut down water consumption on campus.
“It is our understanding that revisions to the current Los Angeles Department of Water ordinance are in progress,” said Carol Fern, director of energy services at USC Facility Management Services, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “While we are exploring numerous options for additional water conservation, we need to make sure that they align with new regulations that are expected to be issued soon.”
In the meantime, the university will continue to abide by emergency drought regulations issued in 2010. Over the last few years, the campus’ water consumption has decreased by 14 percent per square foot, Fern said.
“USC is committed to strong environmental stewardship and is actively engaged in water conservation programs,” Fern said. “The USC Water Conservation Committee is working with partners in both the private and public sectors to look at innovative approaches to make meaningful contributions in water conservation that benefit not only USC but the entire extended Los Angeles community.”
Gov. Jerry Brown issued California’s first statewide mandatory water restrictions on April 1. California water districts, in their fourth year of drought, must reduce water consumption by a total of 25 percent.
Los Angeles has a different water-use reduction goal than other areas, as each water district has already conserved disparate amounts of water. These individual conservation goals, according to scpr.org, should be released by June. USC’s part in additional water conservation is still in the works.
Brown also mandated that 50 million square feet of California land will be replaced with drought tolerant landscaping. The Water Conservation Committee is considering converting “non-event” lawns to drought tolerant landscapes. Currently, the lawn at Brian Kennedy Field is being replaced with 53,000 square feet of artificial turf. The committee is also discussing fountain operation and sprinkler use.
Additionally, Brown called for a rebate program to encourage the use of water-efficient appliances.
“FMS currently uses a number of water-efficient technologies, including soil moisture and weather-based irrigation systems and cooling tower conductivity metering to minimize water usage,” Fern said.
Fern suggests that to help the campus save water, resident students should report any leaks, broken irrigation or any concerns about water usage to the Facilities Customer Service Center.
Many students are supportive of any efforts by the university to conserve more water.
“I heard about Stanford shutting down their fountains months ago, and I was thinking that a student group should do something about the drought,” said Michael Lim, a sophomore majoring in economics and cognitive science. “As great as it is to take shorter showers and water your plants less, it’s aggregate water consumption that uses the most.”
Lim also feels that turning off the fountains could send a positive message to potential students about USC’s views on environmentalism.
“I don’t see why turning off fountains would be at all harmful because USC has a reputation to uphold for potential candidates,” Lim said. “Even tour guides could say something like, ‘We’re really environmentally conscious; we shut off all our fountains because USC cares about water.’”
Other students expressed that they would like for the school to encourage more action by the whole community.
“Until I saw one friend post an article about the water shortage, I was relatively unaware,” said Kylie Nicholson, a senior majoring in media arts and practice. “The shortage and its severity seem to be invisible or unrecognized by the majority of USC students. I think USC could and should lead a campus-wide initiative to encourage water conservation.”
As the university continues to find ways to reduce water consumption, people such as Hilda Blanco, director of the USC Center for Sustainable Cities, recommend that everyone make changes to their behaviors, such as purchasing shower timers, to save water.
“It’s not merely good for us to do something that is sustainable — we have a social obligation to reduce our water use as much as possible,” Blanco said.

During last night’s Senate meeting, USG announced the new executive cabinet appointments for the 2015-2016 academic year.
President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler began their presentation by describing the selection process for the cabinet positions. In the evaluation procedures, seven executive board members read 200-plus applications. After the first cut, 140 applicants remained, each of whom received an eight to 15-minute interview. Interviews focused on questions gauging the “vision, capability and skill” of each applicant.
The new advocacy directors include Brianna Thorpe, Moira Turner, Eric Miller, Maariyah Patel, Austin Dunn and Christine Hasrouni.
The new senior advisor is Alana Victor, a former Annenberg Radio News reporter, a blog writer and former editor at the Daily Trojan and former Kappa Alpha Theta chief operating officer.
The new executive assistants are Donielle Bunyard and Jacqueline Jabarian.
The new secretary is Amy Perez and the new parliamentarian is Holly Bard.
The new funding directors include Jennifer Wu, Samantha Cheng, Matt Linton, Stephen Chu and Christian Edwards.
The new communication directors include Paul Samaha, Frank Fink, Katherin Wilcox, Matt Burke, Ricardo Galvez, Allegra Miller, Morgan Monahan and David Moreno.
New Program Board appointments include Joseph Chen, Daniel Zhu, Kyle Herman, Beverly Pham, Josh Chang, Katya Sutil, Kathryn Kelly, Michael Iluma, Katherine Wang, Devin Trabant, Leo Zhao, Tyler Evans, Amy Lee, Judah Joseph, Caitilin Harriford, Zoe Willis, Maggi Yang, Caitlin Tran, Chelsea Zhang, Elizabeth Bricker, Jade Shi, Rona Sheen, Maya Getter, Amanda Verdadero and Cole Karaba.
Controversy around the cabinet selection process arose after some submissions on the anonymous bulletin board application Yik-Yak accused the selections of eliciting “nepotism.”  An Annenberg TV News story and a Huffington Post blog by USC freshman Lani Renaldo both reported on these allegations, citing the anonymous submissions on the app as a primary source.
Renaldo claimed in her blog post that the Sampath and Fowler were involved in “vote-buying, corruption and nepotism,” and that the USG student body lacks interest in the election cycle.
Such claims, however, were denied at length in a USG official statement, which was released via Facebook on Tuesday evening.
“Yik Yak is not a credible source of information,” the statement read. “While the application can provide comedic entertainment, the platform is often used for students to spread cruel rumors about others.”
The statement also accused Renaldo of making libelous claims.
Following the Senate meeting, Sampath and Fowler discussed the complaints.
“Some of my closest friends applied and did not get in,” Fowler said. “They were people on our campaign that we didn’t choose, volunteers that campaigned for hours on Trousdale that did not get selected. And there were also newcomers that made it because they were qualified. For two weeks we held interviews from 6 to 11 p.m. So if that isn’t a commitment to impartiality, I don’t know what is.”
Sampath and Fowler said the controversy was potentially fueled by applicants who did not receive an appointment. Even those who did not get appointments, however, could still get involved with USG and move their way up the ladder, they said.
Fowler also stressed that controversies like this are to be expected.
“It boils down to the fact that every time you make a strong stand for something people will oppose. You can’t make decisions without gaining opponents,” Fowler said.
Sampath also highlighted the counterproductivity of such controversies.
“I just want everyone to know that we are here to work for our peers,” Sampath said. “The more time we have to [spend dealing] with this controversy, the less time we have to work on USG. All that time we spent writing the statement against the slanderous remarks was time that we could’ve used to organize events and programs for students.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Alana Victor holds positions at Annenberg Radio News and Kappa Alpha Theta. Victor no longer holds these positions. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The arraignment for three of the four defendants charged with the murder of USC graduate student Xinran Ji was postponed Tuesday.
Judge James R. Brandlin said the arraignment will now take place May 14.
Jonathan Del Carmen, Andrew Garcia, Alejandra Guerrero and Alberto Ochoa are charged with attacking Ji, a 24-year-old engineering graduate student who was walking home from a study group in July.
Ji was beaten with a baseball bat during an attempted robbery. He returned to his apartment where he died a few hours later as a result of his injuries.
Though all four defendants will be tried as adults, only Del Carmen and Garcia are eligible for the death penalty.  Guerrero and Ochoa were minors when the crime was committed.
Garcia was not present in court on Tuesday. In February, he underwent evaluation and a mental competency hearing. The court determined he was fit to stand trial. Garcia’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 29, after which prosecutors said he will likely join the three other defendants for arraignment.
Christopher Chaney, Ochoa’s attorney, said multiple continuances are common in cases where the death penalty is involved. The District Attorney’s office must prepare a memo outlining a suggested punishment and that memo is then sent to a committee for a final decision.
Rose Tsai, the attorney for Ji’s family, said her clients are following the case closely and hoping for the most severe punishment possible.
“The last thing they want is their son to have lost his life in vain,” Tsai said. “They’re hoping justice will be done in this case and it will serve as a deterrent so situations like this won’t happen to any other students.”
Tsai said Ji’s parents have also spoken with Deputy District Attorney John McKinney about the trial but have yet to decide if they will come from China to Los Angeles for the proceedings.
The trial must begin within 60 days of the arraignment.
Since Ji’s murder, the university and the Dept. of Public Safety instituted several new security measures including year-round employment of off-campus security personnel, increased nighttime patrols and enhanced analytics for video camera monitoring. In November, DPS launched the mobile safety app LiveSafe.
Despite the fact that the murder victim was a USC student and the crime occurred only a few blocks from campus, Chaney, who is also a USC alumnus, maintains that the defendants did not target USC or its students specifically.
“It’s not ‘the USC case,’” he said. “It’s just a case that happened near USC.”

It was the opportunity of a lifetime. The pundits and commentators were filled with so much excitement — and so much hyperbole. All they needed was one team, America’s team, to deliver one more win, and the moment could be remembered forever. The headlines were even already written.
“Wisconsin Saves College Basketball.”
Frank Kaminsky wasn’t the hero we deserved, but was certainly the hero we needed. Sadly, tragically, heartbreakingly, the 6-foot-11 warrior came up just short. His Wisconsin Badgers — our Wisconsin Badgers — fell to Duke in the NCAA men’s basketball championship game on Monday, and all hope was lost.
O.K., it wasn’t going to be that bad. The buildup to the final game was actually relatively reasonable. But I briefly wanted to pay tribute to all the fantastic sportswriting around the country that would have been if Wisconsin had held on to win.
Nonetheless, this year was a big year for college basketball. The final team cutting down the nets might not have been exactly who most fans would have predicted or hoped for going into March. But the tournament and overall season showed the sport is in a much better condition than a lot of sportswriters said it was in at the start of the tournament. Though it was a slow year for USC men’s basketball, the general state of the sport bodes well for the Trojans eventually becoming competitive.
I did jump onto the Badger bandwagon just a little bit on Monday, so I was a little disappointed to see them finish without raising the trophy. Though there was obviously a great deal of exaggeration behind the introduction, there’s always some truth to that which gets blown out of proportion.
The biggest critique of college basketball highlights exactly what makes Wisconsin so unique and likable. The recent history of the sport has been characterized as the one-and-done era, where most of the top players on top teams spend only a year playing in college before declaring to play professionally. Because NBA rules require amateur players to wait at least one year after graduating high school before being eligible to enter the draft, the NCAA becomes concentrated with guys who probably have the talent to play in the pros right out of high school but don’t stay in the NCAA long enough to really develop as amateur players.
In comes Kaminsky.
The aforementioned center-stretch forward wasn’t recruited that highly out of high school, but he ended up at Wisconsin, a solid Big Ten program. He didn’t amount to much his first two seasons on the court, getting only a couple of minutes a game for the Badgers, but he had a breakout junior year, averaging about 14 points a game and leading Wisconsin to the Final Four. When the Badgers got knocked out by Kentucky that year in the semifinals, Kaminsky could have called it quits and gone to the pros as a solid NBA prospect, but he decided to stay his for his senior season to get another crack at the national championship.
Sure enough, Kaminsky got his second chance. Wisconsin knocked out previously undefeated Kentucky in this year’s Final Four, a monumental upset — no exaggeration this time — to avenge last year’s loss and earn a spot in the final. He then scored 21 points and nabbed 12 rebounds in the championship game against Duke, though it was just shy of what the Badgers needed for a national title in their 68-63 loss.
Besides just Kaminsky, Wisconsin really was a different brand of basketball than Duke and Kentucky, the two biggest favorites going into the tournament. The team relied on other upperclassmen like Josh Gasser, Sam Dekker, Duje Dukan and Traevon Jackson. Of the seven Badgers who got minutes in the final, four were seniors, one was a junior, two were sophomores, and none were freshman. Duke on the other hand started three freshmen in the final, while Kentucky started two in semifinal.
Beyond just the roster, Wisconsin played a very team-oriented style of basketball. It seemed like all five guys on the floor were capable of driving to the hoop and shooting from beyond the arc. Someone would drive, draw help, kick the ball out to a teammate. He would then drive and draw more help, and they would cycle through this several times during the shot clock before someone would settle for an open shot. Duke, on the other hand, was much more reliant over the season on dishing the ball down to star freshman center Jahlil Okafor on the low post before he would dump in a layup.
Not that Duke didn’t play         team-oriented basketball. In fact, Duke’s success in the final arguably was because the Blue Devils had unusually balanced scoring — Kaminsky did a really good job getting Okafor into foul trouble , but other Blue Devil freshmen stepped up. But there was a clear difference in the type of system the teams ran.
When you combine the type of players on Wisconsin’s roster with the system the Badgers coach Bo Ryan ran on offense, you see the case in point for the four-year player. Wisconsin ran a beautifully efficient offense — the Badgers led the nation in points per possession — with so many threats from every spot on the court, but that system only works if players have time to develop into complete packages over their four years in college.
Okafor, for example, is a dominant post presence and will make quite a living in the NBA posting up from the low blocks, but he isn’t exactly a slick ball handler or sharp shooter from outside. On the other hand, Kaminsky can score from the low post as well, but he can also handle the ball like a guard and hit            long-range jumpers pretty consistently. Having a guy who can score inside and hit three-pointers really stretches the defense and opens up the floor for an offense. Though he would trade it in a heartbeat for Okafor’s national championship ring, Kaminsky did beat out Okafor for the national player of the year award for being that all-around threat.
That’s what makes this championship result disappointing for a sports fan like me. While watching talents like Okafor work their craft in the college game is fun to watch, there really is something inspiring about watching a group of guys build up over four years then win the championship in their senior year. Without getting too dramatic again, Wisconsin’s loss is almost an indictment on the American dream, or the idea that hard work and perseverance will eventually win over pure talent or circumstance.
With all that being said, it’s very important for fans not to hold some kind of judgement against one-and-done players. Okafor will almost certainly declare for the draft this year. While the storybook ending would be for him to have fallen just short this year as a freshman, stick around Duke until delivering that championship then finally win it all in 2018, these guys aren’t subjects for our entertainment. The fact that many of the best prospects leave college and declare for the draft as early as possible doesn’t make them sellouts. Some of them might come from a disadvantaged background and need to sign a professional contract to take care of their family. The guys who stick around for four years probably don’t have that pressure.
Ultimately, though, the fact that Wisconsin didn’t win the championship doesn’t mean the    four-year model is dead. Just by making it to the final actually proves the opposite. The Badgers claimed 36 victories this season, won the highly competitive Big Ten, qualified as a No. 1 seed, survived the first four rounds of the tournament, upset one of the most highly touted teams in recent history in the Final Four and were neck-and-neck with the eventual national champion in the final. Five points doesn’t change all that.
This is really good news for many programs around the country, such as USC. Sure, the team watching one shining moment at the end of the season wasn’t really watching its first shining moment, and the national powerhouses such as Duke, Connecticut and Kentucky seem to have an oligopoly on both the five-star recruits and national championships. But it’s possible for a group of good coaches and great players to eventually develop into a consistent Final Four team.
So thank you, Wisconsin, Frank Kaminsky, Bo Ryan and every other member of this year’s Badger team. Thank you for saving college basketball.
Now if only someone could figure out how to save USC basketball.

There is nothing to save with Trojan basketball because it has not existed for sixty years save one or two
glorious seasons. You need some one and dones to mix with the blue collar workers. Especially if you are
trying to establish a competitive program. Waste two years like USC has done recently with no guarantee
next season will be special regarding the returning players.

USC football kicked off the final week of spring practice yesterday at Cromwell Field. With just two practices remaining before this weekend’s spring game, the Trojans took the field in a practice that was open to the public and gave fans a small taste of what to expect this Saturday and beyond.
Rain or shine
It drizzled throughout practice, with temperatures dropping into the 50s. The weather may not have boosted the fan turnout, but the team embraced the rain as a challenge to run practice in unfamiliar conditions.
“It was cool that it rained — it’s something we’re not used to,” senior quarterback Cody Kessler said. “When we go to Oregon or we go play Washington or wherever, it could be a [factor].”
Go long
The rain certainly didn’t affect Kessler or the rest of the Trojan offense, which looked very sharp on a day focused on deep throws down the field. Late in practice, Kessler took advantage of a blown coverage to find redshirt sophomore wideout Steven Mitchell, who hauled in the pass and ran it in for a 90-yard touchdown. Kessler’s next throw hit sophomore Adoree’ Jackson streaking down the sideline for another big gain.
Head coach Steve Sarkisian was pleased with his quarterback’s throwing, and was equally happy about the variety of targets Kessler had at his disposal.
“[Throwing deep] has been a point of emphasis for the last couple practices … and it showed up today,” Sarkisian said. “And it was a variety of guys doing it: Steven Mitchell, Adoree’, [junior] wide receiver Darreus Rogers, and [redshirt junior] wide receiver Isaac Whitney, so that part was really cool.”
USC now aims to incorporate more deep throws into its game plan, and coach Sarkisian set the bar at eight per game.
“I worked for Al Davis for a year … and his theory was that you should throw two deep balls a quarter,” he said. “That makes the defense weary of [getting] beat deep, and that makes a lot of the things underneath a lot easier.”
Sarkisian did note that life would get harder for the offense once Jackson returned to playing cornerback in Thursday’s practice, and he praised his defense for “winning practice” by stopping the offense in a           best-of-five challenge between the two units.
“We’re going to have games when…we’ll be counting on our defense to get that critical stop at the end to go win the game, and that’s exactly what happened today,” he said. “The defense found a way to get three stops in a row on third down to win the finish challenge.”
Spring Game
Though there is still one practice left before the spring game, anticipation for this weekend is building, as fans are eager to see their talented Trojan squad in some semblance of game action, and the players are ready to show off what they have been working on this spring.
“I think people will be surprised and excited about some of these new faces that have been stepping into big time roles and have been playing well,” Kessler said.
Both Kessler and senior tailback Tre Madden praised their offensive line, which has provided great protection for the quarterback and has set gaping holes for runners throughout the spring.
“The offensive line has improved a lot,” Madden said. “They have a lot more experience than last year and there are some beasts up front, so they are going to be fun to run behind.”
Sarkisian was not sure what the format of the spring game would be, but did confirm that it would not be a full game and would more likely involve running plays with a scoring system for both the offense and the defense.
“We’re just not exactly where we need to be depth chart-wise,” he said. “I would love to split up teams and play a game and split up the staff, but we’re just not there yet.”
The spring game kicks off at 3 p.m. this Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Quick takes
Sarkisian said that Adoree’ Jackson is currently working on becoming a bigger deep threat on offense for the Trojans.
“Adoree’ has been very good in the short-intermediate game and we really feel like his next level is catching those deep balls,” Sarkisian said.
Sarkisian could not confirm whether Jackson would play on both sides of the ball in the spring game.
Tre Madden was glad to finally participate in some higher contact drills in practice after being held out of them for most of the spring, but there is no indication yet of how involved he will be this Saturday.
Sophomore safety John Plattenburg is currently nursing an ankle injury.
Senior defensive lineman Claude Pelon missed practice to focus on academics, Sarkisian said.
Thursday’s practice will be open to the public at 3:30 p.m. at Cromwell Field.
Trojans and deep balls–is there ajoke somewhere??

Writing a book is hard enough as it is. There are plenty anecdotes of famous writers agonizing over the creative process and taking years to craft their work. But the daunting task is one that USC graduate student J.R. Ramsey understood and decided to take on while balancing a job and schoolwork. He put the finishing touches on Fennec, his first book, at the end of last year, and he is now planning to continue writing after he graduates in May. That success did not happen easily. Fennec was the culmination of years of persistence paying off while changing jobs and eventually, going back to school.
Ramsey grew up in Ruston, a small town in northern Louisiana, reading Chris Claremont’s classic run at the head of Uncanny X-Men. As Ramsey put it, “This was before liking comic books was cool.”
Ramsey’s passion for the super-powered mutants is apparent when one reads Fennec. The story follows a teenage boy, Sam Marino, as he adjusts to life as a freshman in high school in a new town. As if that adjustment weren’t enough, he, along with a handful of other classmates develop strange new superpowers that they must learn to control. The source of the powers and mysterious creatures that appear and threaten the kids are a mystery that the main characters must solve over the course of the book. The story is fun, interesting and would not be out of place in one of Marvel’s many X-Men side projects such as Alpha Flight, X-Men: Legacy and Generation X. The writing is not exactly at Claremont’s level, but then again, very little writing is.
When he was in school, Ramsey’s didn’t initially set out to do his best Claremont impression. After graduation from Centenary College of Louisiana — currently holding a student body of just over 600 — Ramsey’s first step was to become a middle school teacher. He was not a fan of the experience.
“Its so hard! That age group is so difficult,” Ramsey said.
He left after only a year of teaching. Despite quickly realizing that teaching middle schoolers was not his cup of tea, the experience did provide one major influence on the path his career would take. In preparation for his role as a teacher, Ramsey read a large volume of young adult novels. Reading these books eventually inspired him to start writing the book that would become Fennec, blending elements from his experiences growing up in Ruston and his beloved Uncanny X-Men.
Six months after he finished his first year as a teacher, work on the book began. Ramsey made a promise to himself to write two to three hours every week no matter what. Ramsey even left one of his jobs, which proved instrumental to allowing him to complete the book amidst many other commitments. “I think that’s what made me finish,” Ramsey said. “Because if I didn’t have that mindset that ‘no matter what I’m gonna work on it at this time on Saturday morning for this many hours,’ then it probably would have never gotten done.”
Soon after finishing his brief teaching stint, he began working full time as a social media specialist for his alma mater. While this added time crunch made writing more difficult, it did not compare to the adjustment he was forced to make when he became a student at USC a year ago. When he began his masters in strategic public relations at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the time commitment tested his resolve in completing his weekly allotment of pages. His realistic weekly goal, however, allowed him to fight on through three or four pages per week at a time.
Though returning to school made writing much more difficult due to the increased time commitment, the addition of USC writing classes provided a major boost to his writing ability.
The new writing skills were a welcome addition, but they also made him realize he should go back to the beginning of his writing to rework everything to make sure the level of writing remained consistent. The addition of more descriptive language helped fully realize the world he was trying to build.
“Coming to USC, I felt like I’ve improved in my writing abilities since my first semester writing classes, and that definitely changed my style. I was like ‘Crap! Now I’ve go to go change the writing from the beginning.’ But in the end it was worth it because [my writing] was a little bit better,” Ramsey said. “Since coming to USC, I’ve learned to write more precisely, allowing me to get my ideas down more clearly.”
If there is one strength to underline in this story, it is that world building. The story is clearly the work of a first-timer. The prose might have improved at USC, but it is not yet the polished writing of a veteran writer. It takes a little long to get to the meat and potatoes of the plot, and the story sometimes gets bogged down in over description. These things, however, are symptomatic of a first-time writer.
What shines through is the creativity that led to an interesting world and super powers — gravity manipulation, for example, which is a very underused power in comics. The world in Fennec shows a lot of promise, and once Ramsey graduates in May and begins to work on the book’s sequel, it will be interesting to see where the story goes.

In response to Syria’s four years of civil war, the impending growth of possible genocide and one of the worst refugee crises, the United States seeks to counter terrorism with militarism. Yet their program to train Syrian forces has been delayed and met with one obstacle after another. For months, the United States has planned the launch of a training program, but as the social and political volatility of the area suggests, this attempt in securitizing Syria will never succeed. Though the priority to take down the Islamic State is a noble one, it is steeped in the far-right baseless optimism of military power and its supremacy in handling foreign policy. In doing so, the United States is not only setting up the Syrian forces to fail, but it also is detrimental to both forces, inadvertently giving ISIS the political capital it needs to further decimate its adversaries.
All of this considered, it is critical to assess the great world power driving this effort. Disregarding the myths of American exceptionalism, nothing legitimizes the United States to play such a role in the Middle East. Looking past the social and cultural understandings of the United States and its role in intervention, the nation’s history of hands-off military engagement, spotty enforcement of provisions abroad and apathetic involvement in genocide prevention deem the United States an unreliable actor.
In terms of logistics, this plan needs a concrete and structural commitment between the rebel forces and the United States, both of whom have a capricious track record. The poorly monitored funding of rebel troops in Iraq and Afghanistan is a key factor in understanding the rise of fundamental Islam. Another push by the United States could drastically change the balance of power in the Middle East, where ISIS and other terrorist organizations have the upper hand.
A social contract of support and the mobilization of about 5,000 Syrian troops in the course of 12 months is not nearly enough considering its opposition, ISIS. Also, both the United States and Syrian forces inadvertently act according to their special interests, which for the rebel troops will most likely be geared toward the dismantling the Assad regime. This type of tactless foreign policy is a recipe for complete chaos. The slight chance of this plan’s success does not supersede the deep repercussions of further instability in the Syrian region.
So-called solutions to the ISIS problem are doomed to fail because they are not addressing the core issue at hand. The administration needs to consider why a country such as Syria is so susceptible to the hold of Islamic Fundamentalism; the answer lies in the extremists that are internalizing terrorism and oppressing civilians into the political system in the Middle East. Systemic issues require diplomatic, long-term changes. Leaving the question of “what to do with ISIS” to be answered by militants is like confining a safe zone to marginal men: It is a ticking time bomb.
Currently, the United States is tending to the Syrian civilian crisis and the growing influence in power of a huge terrorist organization. Arguably, the United States is seeing the same war in the Middle East over and over again; this is a repeat of Iraq and Afghanistan. Time and time again, the government disregards terrorism and its detriments as a local issue. It is a direct result of what happens when a governing entity cannot provide fundamental and cosmopolitan rights to its people. Mobilizing rebel forces is simply a temporary fix with long-term blowbacks for the intervening forces, ensuring hostility for the citizen sector and serious anxieties over inevitable spill-overs in regional areas.
The physical delays of the program are a sign that the United States should not mobilize rebel forces but instead empower them with the educational, socioeconomic and cultural needs of which they are deprived.
I
often wonder how a human brain takes all information coming into it and changes
reality into just the opposite. Beyond my comprehension what makes a lib brain
become so stupid
As a student, Lida clearly has much to learn about America and its role in foreign affairs.  She blames “far-right baseless optimism” for our military action when Mr. Obama, who is Commander In Chief, is calling the shots.  Diplomacy is the solution??  If so, Mr. Kerry has failed miserably at his job.  
“Boots on the ground” will not solve the IS problem.  Until Muslims take a stand against ISIS and other groups that have hijacked their religion to further political objectives/proxy wars, terrorism in the name of Allah will continue.  Talk is cheap, so sadly action in this case will involve even more bloodshed, but at least the real issue will be dealt with appropriately.
Lida is kidding, right? ISIS, Al-Fuqra, Al-Qa’ida and other insurrectionists, along with the Syrian government, are slaughtering people indiscriminately, but “empowering the people with educational, socioeconomic and cultural needs” is the answer?  They do have those needs, but when someone is getting ready to saw their heads off, the need for military defense comes first. Lida is right about one thing. The Syrian regime, ISIS, Al-Fuqra, Al-Qa’ida and the other belligerents hate us fiercely. None are allies or even faintly friendly to us. So let us not intervene in their civil war ON THE PART OF ENTITIES WHO HATE US and want to kill us. We do not need more dead and maimed US soldier “trainers” killed or maimed in defense of our bitter, vicious enemies.
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own
problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait
with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out
instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and
peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which
is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be
discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in
the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an
alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that
emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a
band-aid on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for
our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as
friends.
Arafat, very well argued and written. For us to invest money, lives, material and time defending our enemies makes no sense. We have no friends among those fighting. Leave the Syrian theater of war alone until and unless our national security is in peril.
Thanks!

If you were to say you were going to Downtown Los Angeles for dining or entertainment 10 years ago, people would have thought you were crazy. The only reason you went Downtown was for cheap Persian rugs or to get a bargain at a weekend swap-meet. Even five or six years ago, it was still relatively unheard of to go to DTLA for to grab a cup-of-joe or meet up with friends at a bar. It was no Santa Monica and it sure did not have a bustling social scene. Today, the revitalization and development of Downtown Los Angeles continues to grow and flex its muscles.
One location that highlights the best today’s DTLA has to offer is The Classic Coffee. Located in Fashion District on the corner of Main and 9th St., The Classic lives up to its name. With large, ceiling-to-floor glass windows offering a view of the city, it’s like New York in L.A. The fully adorned potted-plant wall is ubiquitous on Instagram and offers a distinct taste to the environment of the shop. The Classic offers a refreshing, modern feel while still retaining a distinctive Los Angeles atmosphere. With pillow-laden stairs, benches, bars, and tables, there’s an abundance of seating perfect for conversation or getting in some solid studying. When you envision a coffee shop in an urban setting, The Classic evokes all the quintessential attributes you’d expect: tempered yet vibrating ambiance, large, open spaces, and of course, great coffee.
The Classic serves Intelligentsia Coffee, a staple of Los Angeles. You can get your Silver Lake defining brew right in Downtown, so you can forget about jumping on the 101 to get your Intel coffee fix. You can’t go wrong with any order, but a cappuccino with soy or vanilla latte with almond milk are sure to please.
Getting to The Classic isn’t too much trouble. It’s about two and a half miles from campus, so you can take a quick drive if you have a car. But considering parking is usually difficult to find in Downtown, especially by The Classic, the best way is to Uber or Metro to 7th St./Metro Center Station and walk. Whether you travel by train, car, or foot, you will not be disappointed.
The Classic is a must-try in Downtown Los Angeles. It’s simply a classic.

When looking at the fluid movement of two people performing the dance of Capoeira, it is difficult to not be inspired by their beautiful movements, especially when thinking about the checkered history behond the dance’s origins. USC junior Azmera Hammouri-Davis has spearheaded a social justice movement that centers around poetry, art and dance. Her “Break the Boxes” poetry series utilizes storytelling and art in hopes of instigating social change that connects people from different cultures.
This summer, the writer will be practicing spoken word in Brazil, sparking conversation and thought about the historical oppression and racism within the region. Traveling through a USC Maymester course, Cultures of Brazil and Lusophone Africa, Hammouri-Davis will visit many cities in Brazil to learn more about Brazilian and Portuguese-speaking African cultures and history. Cities include Salvador de Bahia and Ipanema.
“I’ve been learning Portuguese since sophomore year, and in Brazil we will be learning about the history, the literature, the language, art and culture,” she said. “More specifically, I am excited about going to Salvador de Bahia which is an underrepresented poor community.” Hammouri-Davis will be collecting research for [USC’s] McNair’s program, where she will be looking at tensions between underrepresented communities and the more elite class, and how race plays into that.
Hammouri-Davis aspires to immerse herself in the culture, and learn about the Brazilians and their way of life. She will be learning about the historical consequences of racial and socioeconomic oppression prevalent in some parts of Brazil. She said she hopes to use her poetry to provide an avenue for self-expression and liberation for the marginalized population she will be interacting with.
Salvador de Bahia was a main port during the transatlantic slave trade and is home to a large population of at-risk youth. Hammouri-Davis’s spoken word series focuses on breaking out of stereotypes and breaking through obstacles. Her first spoken word video named, “Capoeira,” is centered on a Brazilian martial arts sport. Her video was recently published in the Social Justice Review.
“Slaves shipped during the transatlantic trade brought to Bahia — that’s how Capoeira was made. In the slums and favelas, where hope had nearly faded. It inspired slaves to create new escapes,” she said. “This trip is for those kids, barely living in the slums, oppression is oppression despite where you come from, and when you do what’s right, movement can never be shunned.”
“Capoeira” was inspired by personal experiences of how misleading and dangerous perceptions can be. Her goal to instigate social change is based on breaking stereotypes, and how others can break the boxes placed by society. For example, on campus, Hammouri-Davis started the Instagram account @TheeHarvest, which highlights everyday USC students that do not fit a stereotypical mold.
Her poem specifically discussed how Capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art form, has become another vehicle for self-expression against oppression. Hammouri-Davis has been practicing Capoeira since childhood and has found this form of martial arts as her lifeline and grounding. Her love for the sport has inspired her desire to travel to South America to learn more about the origin and people within the Capoeira community, and to bring it back to Los Angeles.
“My poem shows my love for Capoeira, and shows why I want to go [to Brazil]. And I want to bring back what I learned in Brazil, by putting on poetry workshops or Capoeira workshops — showing the importance of study abroad. Even by just thinking about studying abroad, my mind has been opened in so many ways, and just learning about the cultures and how we are so interconnected,” Hammouri-Davis said. “And I feel that sometimes staying in one place can limit you. And with this series, I am expanding my own mind, and now I have the possibility of bringing it back to USC.”
Spoken word is a outlet for individuals to express their feelings and struggles, and Hammouri-Davis has inspired many individuals to share their stories. She has volunteered at Level Playing Field Institute, a non-profit organization based in Oakland that works with Latino and Black youth to prepare for college, where she set up poetry workshops. Her passion to inspire change in individuals and on a social level has marked her time at USC.
“I am very passionate about social justice. Since coming to ’SC and taking my first social issues class and going to Alabama for an alternative spring break program, my passion has just built. In Oakland, I did poetry workshops, and I realized how much they just lit up and became empowered by just telling their story,” Hammouri-Davis said. “I never really saw the power in telling my stories. You’re vulnerable and it’s your story, but just seeing how those students responded really empowered me to share my story. I began just to do any performance on campus, and people started reaching out to me and I was so surprised and honored.”

If you’re looking for new music to blast on your next road trip or a soundtrack to a film about the American dream, look no further than Lower Dens’s latest release, Escape from Evil. These melancholy jams are complex and moving, evoking the proverbial idea of riding off into the sunset. Adopting generations of music and mixing them together with hauntingly beautiful vocals, this indie rock group from Baltimore makes the perfect car companion, and their third studio album is a must-have.
Combining the synths and beats of ’80s techno with modern beach-band vocals and guitar, Lower Dens creates an experience unlike any other. Formed in 2010, the band has grown significantly in the last few years. Lead singer Jana Hunter began her career as a solo folk artist and has been shaping her sound ever since, leading to the now psychadelic beach-pop that makes up this album.
“When we started writing, I had a lot going on personally; the band had a lot going on, and it seemed not just appropriate but really necessary for it to be a personal record. It needed to serve that purpose,” Hunter said in an interview with website PopMatters.
This anxiousness is clear in the songwriting, especially in the track, “Your Heart Still Beating.” Opening with a slow drum build-up, the song unfolds into a heart-melting melody about love and loss.
“All of my fears, coming to life,” croons Hunter as she weaves through atmospheric synths and effect-heavy guitar riffs. It is repeated over and over again, driving the point home, and makes for an incredible chorus. Much of the album operates on this level, with simple, bare lyrics and heavy atmospheres that work together to create a mood more than a song.
“I Am The Earth” finds Hunter achieving difficult-to-reach notes, and it is a poignant moment on the album. She moans tirelessly without words through the last half of the song, using her vocals as an instrument to elevate the song’s mood. There are few voices in the world that will move you like Hunter’s, and on “I Am The Earth,” she pulls out all the stops to exemplify that.
The lead single off Escape from Evil, “To Die in L.A.,” begins with a ’90s punk beat and quickly transitions to an ’80s keyboard riff with ’60s beach guitar, combining the elements of several generations of music into one exciting, yet sad melting pot. It is a reflection of the artists, who are still in the midst of finding their sound. The chorus, short and sweet, is the perfect motto for Lower Dens.
“Time will turn the tide,” sings Hunter, hopeful and strong. The video accompanying this track is strange, telling the story of an L.A. girl who dreams of being famous. This, too, reflects the sentiments of a band on the rise, trying to make it in L.A., and Hunter is featured prominently in the video, head shaved and cross-dressed, as the male lead.
Pitchfork listed Escape from Evil as on their list of Best New Music, giving it an 8.3/10. While this does not correlate to higher record sales, Lower Dens’s star is rising. Several members have left or been replaced, probably another reason for a changing sound, but if they can stay together long enough, this group of artists will find success in the music industry. Even with the changing members, this a group that is willing to put in the effort. Their last album, Nootropics, was written while still on tour for their first album, signaling that Lower Dens shows no sign of slowing down. Still, Hunter said that touring did wear on the young band, and that this most recent work is a reflection of that.
“I think this record is a bit of a reaction to touring that record,” said Hunter. “Being in that space for a long time, being in an emotionally distant, forced intellectual space. Getting back to writing songs about intimate things felt a lot better.”
Lower Dens is a band that still has a long way to go. They’ve put out three wholly different albums now, ranging from heavy atmospheres to truly experimental pieces, but on Escape from Evil, they have found a sound. Whether or not this band is done growing, their music is certainly strong enough to enter mainstream culture, and Escape from Evil is an excellent source of deep, inspiring music. If you’re looking to cruise around Los Angeles on a somber night, or just want some solid studying music, look no further than this album.

The popular vegan and organic family-owned restaurant Café Gratitude officially opened a new location in the Arts District in downtown at the end of March. Café Gratitude is known as a hotspot for vegans and carnivores alike in Los Angeles and has other locations in Venice and Hollywood. Now, USC vegans and vegan enthusiasts can celebrate with this nearby option for raw and healthy fare.
In addition to an accessible and trendy location in the Arts District, Café Gratitude’s newest location has convenient parking. The space is similarly decorated to its other locations, with a significant amount of square footage. White, minimalist walls and wood accents accentuate the space. In addition, the wall-to-wall windows let in a large amount of natural light that properly enhances the expansive area of the restaurant. This airy and spacious restaurant is a positive contrast to the cramped and confined environment of downtown.
At this new location, Café Gratitude unveiled a new dinner menu that will be available at 5 p.m. Each dish is packed with super foods and vegetables that fuel a healthy lifestyle. Café Gratitude additionally has raw desserts, juices, tonics and Stumptown coffee. For those who are afraid that a vegan meal will not be filling would be quite surprised. The restaurant’s entrees are flavorful and satisfying. With innovative additions such as cashew cheese, coconut jerky and basil hempseed pesto, non-vegan food is not at all missed.
The son of the owners, manager Cary Mosier, said there are discerning attributes of how Café Gratitude prepares its food.
“From a food aspect, all of the food we serve is vegan. Everything is use is 100 percent organic, down from the spices to the salt,” he said. “We make everything in-house, we don’t open anything with a can opener or buy anything premade.”
Everything from the sauces, the dressings and the mustard is made from scratch at Café Gratitude.
Café Gratitude is more than just wholesome food. It encompasses a culture of positivity — “whole in consumption and whole in spirit.” The family-owned restaurant hopes to encourage their patrons to instill aspects of their mission in their lives.
What further distinguishes Café Gratitude from the usual vegan restaurant is the unique menu titles. Each item name is an adjective, such as “Whole,” “Powerful,” “Fulfilled” or “Bountiful.”
“My family owns the business, and my mom came up with this idea,” Mosier said. “The idea is part of the culture, where we really aim to have an environment that fully encompasses our culture, such as affirmations. Instead of ordering a cafe salad, we call it ‘I Am Fulfilled,’ so you actually have the opportunity to actually say that you are fulfilled. We believe that the words we say about ourselves and of others actually have an impact on our lives.”
Mosier is very enthusiastic about the positivity that these messages foster in their customers.
“If you think about it, we are constantly affirming ourselves — usually in a negative way. It becomes an unconscious mechanism, and we wanted people to practice saying what is positive. It’s an invitation to change the way people see eating and change the way people see how their words affect their lives.”
Mosier is enthusiastic about this goal for the business.
“We are really trying to build a business that celebrates gratitude and appreciation,” Mosier said. “We operate on the assumption that being who we are and living in the country we are living in and having the privileges that we all have, we have an infinite amount to be grateful for.”
To celebrate that gratitude and appreciation, it was very important to Mosier and his family to be “surrounded in an environment that’s healthy physically, mentally and emotionally.”
Café Gratitude is under the new apartment complex, One Santa Fe, and this new location is among the original artisanal restaurants in the area. Just down the street is The Pie Hole, Wurstküche and another vegan restaurant, The Springs. The Art District also boasts famous restaurants such as Bestia and Church & State. Upcoming businesses include GROW, a high-end market and Van Leeuwen Ice Cream. Mosier said his family is excited for the up-and-coming neighborhood.
“Everyone is excited about the revitalization, transformation that is going on in the Arts District. Being down here while all these new businesses are popping up, and you are starting to see a culture form in a different part of the city,” Mosier said.  “There’s all these new possibilities … and we are excited to be a part of it.”
The Arts District is slowly transforming with this new generation of restaurants and markets that embrace the trendy, health-conscious lifestyle of Angelenos. Café Gratitude is sure to be at the forefront of this transition.

“If we just got rid of California agriculture, that would solve the problem.”
“If California controlled its immigration, there’d be less water consumers, and we wouldn’t be in this predicament.”
“A 25 percent reduction is an unfair request that only penalizes urban and suburban residents.”
Gov. Jerry Brown’s new mandatory restrictions call on California’s cities and towns to cut back on their water usage by 25 percent, sparking a barrage of complaints from residents. From the comments section of news sites discussing the restrictions, one would guess that the governor had asked residents to ration their drinking water to one glass a day.
The mandatory restrictions quickly turned into a blame game. Urban residents blame agriculture, refusing to change their own lifestyle until farmers reduce their water usage. Farmers call out suburban homeowners for unnecessary luscious lawns. Republicans blame immigration.
California now stands divided, with an us-versus-them mentality that, judging from the viciousness of comments sections and discussion forums, could turn the state’s first water restrictions into the state’s first civil war.
It is, however, time for urban residents to quit blaming and complaining and finally start conserving and adjusting at the personal level, a move which should have begun years ago. Cutting 25 percent from our potable water use sounds daunting, but this doesn’t mean a post-apocalyptic, dramatic scene of water shortages. In reality, it’s not that difficult for non-farming folks. The cuts will address water-wasting habits that are neither sustainable nor necessary for survival. Consider the fact that more than half of residential water usage goes towards landscaping — simply kicking California’s lawn habit will save a significant chunk of water.
It’s time to let go of the lawn. Californians love aesthetics, but green lawns can no longer serve as a sign of beauty in California. Instead, they represent ignorance and a blatant disregard for the state’s plight.
The need for water conservation definitely shouldn’t come as a surprise to Californians. At this point, policymakers have tried everything. Prior to the drought, the state’s gentle “Save Our Water” campaign politely asked people to take shorter showers. Then, the drought began, and last year, Brown set a goal of a 20 percent water reduction. Californians interpreted this as a suggestion and apparently ignored it, as water use actually rose in some areas.
This apathy and ignorance from residents is what made the mandatory restrictions absolutely necessary. Restrictions and penalties are coupled with rebate programs, monetary incentives for residents to make adjustments such as installing drought-tolerant landscaping or buying efficient appliances.
Instead of waiting around until they’re forced to make a change, Californians need to step up and take personal responsibility for their own water usage.
Those who object to lifestyle changes at the residential level are quick to point out that agriculture accounts for 80 percent of the state’s water use. Turning over acres of farmland, however, is much harder than turning over a few feet of front lawn. It’s a matter of letting go of a space that exists purely for decoration or altering an entire livelihood.
Yes, California agriculture uses 80 percent of the state’s water, but it also contributes to a sizable portion of the nation’s produce, an arguably more worthy cause than an aesthetically pleasing front yard.
“Drought tolerant” is the phrase of the summer in California. Homes, businesses and universities, including USC, will all need to transition away from turfgrass and utilize other alternatives.
Californians have ignored the drought for four years, effectively avoiding any major lifestyle changes. The pointing fingers and refusal to adjust is ridiculous. We need to start moving forward, and making the permanent lifestyle adjustments that will change how we use water in California. The reality is, even when the drought ends, water conservation will remain necessary.
Californians need to cut unnecessary water use. It’s that simple. Think before you turn on a faucet — long showers, hosing down cars, watering lawns — if we’re going to meet the 25 percent mark, we need to cut back on flagrant water-wasting.
Eventually, people might need to re-evaluate agricultural water use. But unless these people are farmers or policy makers, there’s not much they can personally do to affect this. But what every Californian can do is take personal responsibility for their own water use, something that has never been done before. Everyone is in this together, California, so quit the blame game.

It’s that time of the year again. Spring break has come and gone, and summer waits just beyond the horizon. As if final papers and exams weren’t stressful enough, women of all ages have yet another seasonal pressure to confront: bikini season. At this point, the yearly campaign to shame women’s bodies into crash dieting and working out is already well under way. Storefronts display picture-perfect shots of models clad in bikinis; magazines boast new shortcuts to a perfect butt and the Internet is abuzz with articles such as “70 Thoughts a Girl Has When Bikini Season is Less Than 60 Days Away.”
Bikini season is in full swing, but it’s not too late to face the truth. There’s nothing wrong with bikinis in themselves, but the meanings and expectations we’ve attributed to two-piece suits need a dramatic revision. Training women to equate warm weather with a perfectly tanned, toned and flawless body promotes an unhealthy belief that a “perfect body” exists, and we need everyone’s help to turn this fallacy on its head.
The first step in confronting the bikini body myth is attacking the source.  At the foundation of this issue lies the media, with its unrealistic depictions of a “normal” woman and its insistence that real women can — and should — change their bodies to fit this image. Too often, retailers’ efforts to capitalize on swimsuit sales perpetuate unhealthy expectations. In an interview with BuzzFeed regarding ModCloth’s February swimwear promotion, the company’s founder and CCO, Susan Koger, addressed the media’s role in perpetuating unhealthy summertime expectations. Koger’s campaign provided a “counterpoint” to the bikini bodies featured in magazines like Sports Illustrated. Koger asked BuzzFeed writer Julie Gerstein, “When is the last time a woman looked at a swimsuit campaign and it made her smile? Like, a real, genuine, feel-good smile?” Despite numerous body-positive campaigns, the answer is never. As if the pressure to look perfect weren’t enough during the rest of the year, it’s more difficult to feel good about your own imperfections when it feels like everything’s out on display. The majority of media outlets privilege one type of bikini body — thin and flawless — so that any deviation from the ideal feels like failure.
Even lighthearted articles like Elite Daily’s “70 Thoughts A Girl Has When Bikini Season Is Less Than 60 Days Away,” reinforce the pressure to tone up by implying it’s a necessary struggle. In the opening blurb, writer Ashley Fern asserts, “There is nothing more daunting than realizing that … summer is less than 60 days away … [A]s every girl knows, two months is probably the bare minimum you need to get your a– in shape.” The repeated use of words like “need,” “important” and “reevaluate” further problematize the issue, preserving the myth by accepting it. Fern assumes that achieving the perfect bikini body is an inherent obstacle for every woman that can be tackled by vigorous dieting and exercise. Of course, this is far from true; emotional eating expert Isabel Duke pointed out in a 2014 HuffPost Live video that body weight is not “exclusively in our control” and that we should privilege the biological mechanisms that tell us what and when to eat above trendy cleanse diets and intensive workouts.
Moreover, advertisements and articles like Fern’s perpetuate an unhealthy fixation on the male gaze, linking bikini season to female objectification. Publications such as Sports Illustrated have sexualized the bikini-clad woman for decades, but Fern’s article takes the bikini fixation a step further, suggesting that even “normal” girls actively evaluate themselves according to male expectations. According to Fern, the 30th thought every girl has “when bikini season is less than 60 days away [sic]” is that waxing body hair will “increase [her] chances of getting laid.” Waxing doesn’t necessitate unhealthy habits, but it’s part of the overall pressure to display a perfect body. Fern revisits the pressure to satisfy men with thought number 58: “You know what they say: Don’t cry over boys, do some squats and make them wish they still had that a–.” As if it weren’t bad enough that the bikini body myth forces women to compare themselves and the bodies of others to Photoshopped ideals, the media often implies that women need to slim down in order to please men.
Overall, body-positive efforts like the ModCloth photo campaign are a step in the right direction, but the bikini body ideal will persist until we step back and reevaluate the abundance of unrealistic expectations put forth by the media. Women should be able to wear bikinis as often or as seldom as they feel comfortable. We shouldn’t hold ourselves back because we’re ashamed of stretch marks or curves, nor should we hold other women to unrealistic standards. We should embrace the bodies we have and rock whatever swimsuits we please — not for men, not for other women, but for ourselves.

Yesterday, I had a conversation with my best friend using emojis alone. And before you ask, yes, I was disgusted with myself.
On one hand, I do feel like I should justify my actions. We know each other, so we know that the pizza emoji doesn’t just mean pizza — it means I want pizza now and we should eat it together. So the tiny iPhone keyboard carries more than just the weight of the literal pictures. And clearly my actions aren’t alone; last June, the launch social network Emojli allowed people to communicate only via emoji.
Ever since the takeover of our everyday communications by these tiny, emotion-filled faces (read: emojis), many have praised the integration of visual expressions of emotion into our now text-based communication that seems so…heartless.
And it’s fair to say that emojis help overcome the confusion behind intention of text-based communication. But since emojis suffer from the same standardized framework as language, on a philosophical level they too are inherently insufficient to completely capture the human experience.
It seems intuitive that words can never fully describe our internal thought process behind each of our actions or truly encapsulate descriptions of our surroundings. Some see this inability as a gift; like in the childhood Telephone Game, in which each person in a circle whispers to the next person what they believe the one before them said, the incongruity between what is said and what is meant can create artistic — or hilarious — results.
But the insufficiencies of language can prove dire to some as well. In fields such as trauma, psychiatry and psychology, even the scientific terms to describe pain (for example, distress, negative emotions, social pain and emotional disturbances), as author Luciano L’Abate describes, “are either left undefined, or if defined, are insufficient and inadequate to describe the internally subjective experience derived from abandonment, abuse, loss, criticism, discounting, or betrayal.”
The introduction of quick visual cues to more deeply portray these emotions, then, should cure the failures of language. But emojis suffer from the same standardization that language does; just as there are a limited number of words and a limited number of ways to string them together, there are a limited number of emojis and thus a limited range of emotions to portray. Granted, there are quite a few to choose from — 722 on the iPhone —but they pale in comparison to the complex sentiments we experience in a single moment that we’d like to share with others.
There is perhaps no way to condense all of our unique intentions into a widely used form of communication. But the rise of emoji culture, the integration of visual and audial forms of communication and the increased desire to share every moment of our lives might bring us very close to making this reality more and more of a possibility.
