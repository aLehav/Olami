In light of recent events in the Middle East that have taken the lives of Israeli and Palestinian civilians, students led on-campus demonstrations Friday. The two movements took place concurrently on Trousdale Parkway.

Last week, more than 400 rockets were fired at Israel with many hitting targets in the country and killing civilians. Israel has responded with attacks on Gaza, which have killed many Palestinian civilians. The escalated violence came after Israel killed Hamas military chief Ahmed Jabari on Wednesday in a precision airstrike. On Friday, President Barack Obama spoke to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterating the United States’ support for Israel’s right to defend itself.
The protests were organized by students on Thursday and advertised to the student body on social networking sites, such as Facebook. Though not affiliated with any student organization on campus, the demonstrations included more than 20 people in support of each cause. Several more students passing by the center of campus offered their support for the demonstrators on either side. Demonstrators held flags and signs representing support for Israelis or Palestinians.
Student demonstrator Linda Fawaz, a senior majoring in international relations global business and a member of Students for Justice in Palestine, was among demonstrators trying to highlight the violence against Palestinian civilians.
“We felt like we needed to bear our signs,” Fawaz said. “This demonstration came out of necessity. We need to do something.”
Several demonstrators supported the idea of a cease-fire in the conflict. Fawaz said students involved in the demonstration also took part in a nonviolent protest at the Los Angeles Consulate on Thursday, an event that inspired students to hold a protest on campus.
“I don’t think a lot of [students] pay attention to world events, so by having this silent solidarity for the victims of Gaza who have been suffering for half a century it might prompt the international community to actually act,” Fawaz said.
Students who stood with Israel also held a peaceful demonstration near Tommy Trojan on Trousdale Parkway. On Friday morning, organizers released 500 balloons, which represented rockets fired toward Israel in the past year. The demonstrators hoped that their gathering could be used to inform the student body of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.
Sarah Sax, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and president of Trojans for Israel, has been following the conflict closely. The past week’s increased attack has led her and other supporters of Israel to react more vocally on this particular issue.
“For years Israel has just been taking it,” Sax said. “We’ve come to a point where we’re not taking it anymore.”
Sax believes demonstrating is a means to drawing attention on the long-lasting conflict. The objective of the event was to educate and raise awareness of the necessity to support Israel and the people being victimized, according to Sax.
“All of this is happening and we just need to react,” Sax said. “We want people to recognize and understand the gravity of this situation and we want people to ask questions, be informed and continue dialogue.”
Another group of students responded to the tension in the demonstrations by sitting in the middle of Trousdale and playing “Why Can’t We Be Friends.”
All demonstrations stressed that they were not trying to conflict with the other one.
“I hope people are just aware,” Sax said. “If we engage students in educated dialogue I believe there will be some change.”
Israel is a racist apartheid society, in fact and in actions. They won’t be happy until all the Palestinians are dead.

there. that’s. better.
In the interest of full disclosure, SJP is a well-known propaganda mouthpiece for Hamas terrorists. 
Recall also, in a 6 to 3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that makes it a crime for Americans to provide “material support” of any kind (be it in the form of cash, weaponry, training, personnel, services, or “expert advice or assistance”) to a foreign terrorist organization, even if that support is for (ostensibly) peaceful purposes.
Hamas would be one such example. It conducts terrorist attacks against Israel with one part of its organization while running charitable endeavors with another. Propagandizing for Hamas allows Hamas to use (alledgedly) “charitable” money elsewhere and allows Hamas to not have to spend propaganda funds for its terrorist activities.
Upcoming Congressional hearings will undoubtedly focus the spotlight on SJP terrorism enablers. For those interested in a fuller disclosure of the SJP, read their dossier @ http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/sjpstand4facts25.html 
So, thanks once again to SJP Hamas propagandists for making it easier for Obama’s NSA to track your activities and Holder’s Justice Department to prosecute your material support propaganda campaign.
By your definition, most of the US Congress is guilty of providing material support for terrorism. Until Israel actually defines its borders, the question of Palestinians using armed agression to repel invaders is less than clear cut. Though international law does not recognize annexing territory via conquest, that is exactly what Israel has been doing over the decades. These standards of human rights were established as a result of the crimes perpetrated against civilian populations after WWII, yet Israel acts as if (and is treated that way by their powerful allies) these standards do not apply to them.
Have you noticed that the D T allows some URLs to post but censors others?
Is there a double standard?
It’s no double standard for a lady with 30 cats!
Cluebat to Buttrey: Your argument is with SCOTUS definition, not me.
Islamo-supremacists of Iran (through their Hamas and Hezbollah proxies) are using terrorism against innocent civilians (both Arab and Israeli) to conitinue global genocidal conquest.
Moreover, Gaza was “annexed” by Hamas and rendered utterly Judenfrei by genocidal Islamo-supremacists. Try harder to avoid parroting silly Hamas propaganda lies.
For those interested in a more scholarly discussion of the genocidal Islamo-supremacism phenomenon, try “The Legacy of Jihad: Islamic holy war and the fate of non-Muslims”

More than 1.1 million children are currently uninsured in California, according to a recent report by the California HealthCare Foundation, an organization developed by the USC Keck School of Medicine and a health policy firm Diringer and Associates.
The study’s findings seem foreboding. California’s proportion of children without health coverage has climbed over the years to reach 11 percent in 2011 — higher than the national average.
According to experts, many factors drive these statistics, including the structure of a parent’s health insurance plan or whether a parent’s employer offers health insurance.
“The most important reasons are that the parents [of the children] work in businesses that are not offering health insurance, either because they can’t afford it or because they choose not to for one reason or another. Or they may offer it to the parents, but not to the kids,” said Michael Cousineau, lead author of the report and USC Keck research associate professor of preventative medicine. “We [also] have large numbers of undocumented kids in California that are not eligible for a lot of programs and public programs.”
Wilbert H. Mason Jr., a USC Keck professor of clinical pediatrics, pointed out several societal repercussions of uninsured youth, such as interference with education and development of long-term disabilities, which might increase the overall cost of health care
“If a child gets meningitis, for example, because they weren’t immunized from that common form of bacterial meningitis, they suffer long-term neurologic complications or have learning disabilities,” Mason said. “[They become] financially [dependent] for the rest of his or her life because of the need to take care of the conditions that … a very simple shot could have prevented.”
Stephanie Lu, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, said it is important that more programs be developed to correct the trend.
“There should be more health programs that have affordable insurance parents can buy for their children, or we need to create more jobs so that parents can make enough money to afford it,” Lu said.
The report suggests that improvement might be on the horizon. The 46-percent expansion of public coverage through Medi-Cal and Healthy Families between 2002 and 2011 continues to fill the gap that the 16 percent decline in employer-based coverage has caused. According to the study, the number of children enrolled in Medi-Cal jumped from 2.6 million in 2001 to nearly 3.7 million in 2011. The new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, if implemented, could also help by expanding access through public programs, such as Medicaid, Cousineau said. In addition, he said California Health Benefits Exchange will support families with subsidized premiums.
“[It will have a] huge impact, because not only is it going to provide new opportunities for kids who don’t have coverage, but it will also provide resources to help them pay for the premium,” Cousineau said. “Also, families in small businesses will be able to buy health insurance through this exchange and pay for it. If they have health insurance when they’re really young, we can pick up problems early on before they get worse. If they see a child with a developmental problem, they can order intervention that will help kids get coverage and the treatments they need.”
According to the report, more than three-quarters of uninsured children in California are currently eligible for Medi-Cal. But eligibility is only the first step.
“We have to find them, we have to educate them about health insurance and what their opportunities are and what their options are, and make it easy for people to enroll and have it [available] at schools and other places where children and their families are more likely to encounter an outreach worker and enroll,” Cousineau said.
The new California Health Benefits Exchange, which will give at least 1 million uninsured children a chance at eligibility for Medi-Cal or private coverage, will still exclude children of undocumented immigrants. They will remain dependent on safety-net clinics and public hospitals, such as the LAC+USC Medical Center, unless changes are made to immigration law.
Vice President of the USC Health Care Business Club Camille Wu, a junior majoring in business administration and public policy, management and planning, said she believes awareness through education is another solution because many people believe young individuals tend to be healthier and do not require insurance.
“One thing that needs to happen is, either through the government or through nonprofits, they need to raise awareness of the effects of being uninsured,” Wu said.
Cousineau believes Californians will see the effects of the Affordable Care Act, enacted in March 2010, and the California Health Benefits Exchange — a set of plans that will be fully implemented in 2014.
“I expect to see [a decrease in the number of uninsured] beginning in late 2013,” Cousineau said, “because already, we’ve been starting outreach efforts.”
Under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) , young people can stay on their parent’s plan up to age 26. That’s a good thing.

California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris discussed a new report, “The State of Human Trafficking in California 2012,” at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Friday. Harris was joined by U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and Attorney General of Mexico Marisela Morales.
Trafficking · California Attorney General Kamala Harris stands with top government leaders Friday as she unveils data from a new report, “The State of Human Trafficking in California 2012.” – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
The press conference detailed the extent of human trafficking in California and suggested strategies for law enforcement and non-governmental organizations to fight against it.
According to Harris, the report, which was released Friday, comes out of several months of work from hundreds of leaders in law enforcement, academia and non-governmental organizations.
“[The report is a] renewed commitment across many jurisdictional lines to combat the issue of trafficking, to renew our dedication to sharing information and intelligence and training to make sure that we maximize our ability to reach out to victims,” Harris said.
The logistics of the report include forecasts on the trends of, and a retrospective on, human trafficking. Data collected by the state of California in conjunction with the report shows evidence that 72 percent of human-trafficking victims are U.S.-born. Six percent are Chinese and 5 percent are Mexican, according to Harris.
“It not only involves the five-year-olds trafficked through the tunnels between Calexico–Mexicali up into California, but it includes the runaway from Kansas being trafficked through Las Vegas into West Hollywood,” Harris said.
Crimes are increasingly involving males as well as females, according to Harris, because of the new demand for labor as well as sex in the trafficking market.
The developments in technology coincide with the increasing rate of this crime because it affects how trafficking can be marketed, according to Harris’ overview. Websites such as www.BackPage.com, which features online classifieds, enable predators to buy their “products” online. Harris said these sites must be shut down and are a top priority for her office.
As criminals rely on technology for marketing, however, the government and collaborators, in the fight against trafficking, have also worked to use technology to their advantage. Harris and her team have recently collaborated with Yahoo!, which agreed to program its search engine so that it would identify words associated with human trafficking and implement a banner with a 1-800 help number for victims.
Hilda Solis, who has worked as the secretary of labor since 2009, said human trafficking is the fastest-growing criminal enterprise in California, but also the most hidden from public view.
“We have an obligation to condemn human trafficking and punish it to the fullest extent of the law,” Solis said.
Solis noted the efforts made by President Barack Obama’s administration and the federal government to strengthen the training of officials to fight this rising crime. According to Solis, one of the federal government’s primary aims is to provide employment services, education and necessary tools to survivors of human trafficking in order to readjust to everyday life.
Mike Ramos, district attorney for San Bernardino, said that with the passage of Proposition 35 — an initiative that imposes larger fines and prison sentences for human trafficking crimes — the laws targeting trafficking are becoming harsher.
“We do have modern slavery now and it’s even worse — it’s underground, it’s behind closed doors, and now it’s going after our children, our most vulnerable victims,” Ramos said.
One of the featured speakers at the event was a former victim of human trafficking, Ima Matul. Matul recollected her story of being lured to America by false promises of a high-paying job and ending up in the hands of human traffickers, who forced her to work 18 hours a day, seven days a week.
After three years of physical and verbal abuse, Matul wrote to the nanny next door with the little English she knew and was able to escape.
“My message for the victims out there is don’t be afraid to come out because I was afraid — I was afraid that nobody out there could help me,” Matul said. “Don’t be afraid. There’s still hope for your life.”
The press conference was part of a symposium on human trafficking. The event was sponsored by the USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy.
We definitely need to stop trafficking at US- Mexico border. Not just in US it is actually going on all over world. We need to reconsider our visa policies and terms. So we can control human trafficking.

With six weeks left for politicians in Washington to steer the nation from the fiscal cliff — drastic tax increases and spending cuts that would take effect in January — a new USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Poll reflects some of the difficulties they might face during negotiations.
The poll shows about 60 percent of Californians support compromise as a means for avoiding the fiscal cliff, but continue to support partisan approaches.
According to the poll, only 32 percent of Californians support their elected representative pushing solutions based on party principles, regardless of whether it holds up other legislation.
Yet, when Democrats and decline-to-state voters were polled about compromising to reduce Medicare and Social Security benefits, 61 percent of those polled said they did not want to cut these benefits as a means of deficit reduction. Thirty-five percent supported cutting some of these benefits if it leads to a compromise on revenue increases.
Similarly, 55 percent of registered Republicans and decline-to-state voters opposed raising taxes to reduce the deficit.
“Almost everybody, both in Washington and in California, wants compromise,” said Dan Schnur, director of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll and director of the Unruh Institute of Politics. “The trick is they want the other side to do all the compromising.”
Schnur added that the poll results reflect a dichotomy between the idea of compromise and the reality of compromise.
“In the abstract, everyone likes the idea of compromise,” Schnur said. “But when it comes to giving up something that is important to them, they tend to dig in.”
Those polled opposed raising taxes by 11 percentage points, but supported increasing taxes on those earning more than $250,000 per year by 36 percentage points.
When asked specifically about former President George W. Bush’s tax cuts, 51 percent of Californians said they preferred extending the tax cuts for those making $250,000 or less, but not for those with higher incomes.
According to the poll, 82 percent of Californians are against reducing Medicare and Social Security benefits. Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior fellow at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, said this reflects the political risk associated with attempting to restructure benefits as a way to reduce the budget.
“It’s not politically feasible,” Bebitch said. “Nobody wants to touch it. Nobody includes the people who vote in elections. It’s going to take a political will and political courage that I haven’t yet seen.”
The poll, which sampled 1,520 registered voters, had a 2.9 percent margin of error. It was conducted by Democratic polling firm Greenbay Quinlan Rosner and Republican polling firm American Viewpoint.
Everyone wants benefits without paying. In reality you always have to pay. Here are some of the ways we pay:
Higher costs for other things, Fewer market choices, Direct taxes, Indirect taxes, Inflation, Lower quality goods & services, More unemployment, …

The undefeated regular season is complete, but for the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team, its biggest challenge lies ahead.
The Trojans (24-0, 8-0) used two clutch goals to pull ahead late on Saturday, hanging on to win 10-9 over crosstown rival UCLA (24-3, 6-1) during a rare night game at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
“We really didn’t have any breathing room the whole game,” senior driver Michael Rosenthal said, “but we came out with a win so that’s all that matters.”
Rosenthal’s hat trick led the scoring effort for the Trojans, while junior driver Nikola Vavic, senior two-meter Matt Burton and junior utility Mace Rapsey added two goals apiece.
“He [Rosenthal] hadn’t been as aggressive as he should lately, so it was great to see his performance,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “He’s got great confidence now.”
The first half was a back-and-forth affair, with the Trojans breaking away from an early 3-3 tie to take a 6-4 halftime lead. The Trojans made it 7-4 just 22 seconds into the third period with a flip shot from Vavic. But No. 2 UCLA wasn’t done just yet.
The Bruins scored three straight goals, two of them by leading scorer Paul Reynolds, and tied the match at 7 before Burton got one back for the Trojans before the end of the third.
Then, UCLA got a power-play strike from defender Chris Wendt to even the match and put USC in an unfamiliar position.
For the first time in 15 games, the Trojans were tied in the fourth period. That didn’t last, as Rosenthal skipped a shot under Rapacz’s outstretched arm to give the Trojans a 9-8 lead.
“I just had to take a shot,” Rosenthal said. “I looked the goalie off a little bit and put it in.”
Later in the period, a pinpoint Rosenthal cross and resounding Rapsey strike later, and the Trojans were up 10-8.
“It felt great,” Rapsey said. “It was such a good pass so I could just pop it in.”
UCLA’s Daniel Lenhart quickly responded to make it 10-9 with 28 seconds left, but the Trojans kept possession for the rest of the contest.
“When they tied the game, we really had to buckle down and find a way to make sure we got stops most importantly, as well as find a way to score a goal,” Rosenthal said. “I’m sure glad we did.”
Vavic, though pleased, pointed out areas in need of improvement.
“We gave up too many goals,” Vavic said. “There were situations where we didn’t block because our blockers didn’t cover their space.”
The win clinches USC’s regular season conference title, giving it the top seed for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championships, where it will face UC Santa Barbara on Friday.
Amazing and epic win!!  Go for five in a row!!  Fight on!

With their season winding down and fresh off a crucial victory over the No. 1-ranked Stanford Cardinal the night before, the USC Women’s volleyball team has its sights set on a long run through the NCAA tournament. Following their most important victory of the season, the Women of Troy celebrated Senior Night by fending off the California Bears 3-2 (23-25, 25-21, 18-25, 29-27, 15-11) on Friday, improving to 26-4 overall and 14-4 in Pac-12 competition.
On a roll · Junior libero Natalie Hagglund recorded 19 digs in No. 8 USC’s win against California on Friday night. USC has won five straight matches. – Deborah Liu | Daily Trojan
“Normally, I do get nervous when as much is on the line,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “I think winning last night took off some of the pressure from this match. Winning both games is important for the rankings and the seedings.”
Senior Katie Fuller, playing in her final regular-season home match, notched her seventh double-double of the season with 14 kills and 10 digs. Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio paced the USC attack, registering 18 kills while also adding nine digs, two aces and two service blocks. The Women of Troy also celebrated the final home appearances of defensive specialist Erin Yoder, who tied her season high with six digs, and middle blocker Natasa Siljkovic, who saw limited action in the beginning of the match.
After jumping ahead 12-6 on three straight points in the first set, the Women of Troy extended the lead to 16-10, then 23-17 after Shaw knocked down consecutive kills. After Cal recorded its 21st point to get within striking distance, Fuller ended the set with a strong left-side kill.
The Bears restored their lead in the third set, as the Women of Troy fell behind 15-9 and failed to recover en route to a 25-18 loss. Fittingly, the critical fourth set was competitive throughout, as USC took an 18-15 lead. However, the Bears put on a strong push, coming back to tie it at 18-18 before claiming match point at 25-24. The Women of Troy staved off elimination with back-to-back Fuller kills to take the lead, and after more back-and-forth action, the Women of Troy sealed the thrilling set as a Bricio kill and subsequent Cal attacking error secured the frame 29-27 for the hosts.
The fifth and final set featured noticeably less drama than its predecessor, as the Women of Troy rode the motivation from their fourth-set victory to a 15-11 clincher. Shaw turned back a shot to put USC ahead 11-5, at which point the lead became insurmountable. Bricio had a block to  secure the 13th point before knocking down a kill to take the match.
Fuller, whose performance on and off the court will surely be missed next season, did not view the match as significantly more special or different emotionally, despite the celebration surrounding Senior Night.
“It was a sentimental game, but I didn’t feel it as much as I thought I would,” Fuller said. “We will hopefully host first and second round, so I think those will be more challenging.”
While the team has certainly met its preseason expectations and is poised to inflict damage in the postseason, Haley stressed the importance of finishing on a strong note and playing without overconfidence.
“It’s a long trip and it’s going to be snowy [in Oregon],” Haley said. “No matter how much I preach, we will be looking forward to UCLA, but we absolutely cannot get caught [off guard] up there. We’ll see what we’re made of on the road because we haven’t done very well on the road, and we need to because we need to win regionals on the road.”
The Women of Troy will conclude their regular season with a match against Oregon State Tuesday before taking on crosstown rival UCLA on Friday night.

PASADENA, Calif. — It was almost exactly a year ago to the day that USC took down No. 4 Oregon on the road at Autzen Stadium, improving its record to 9-2 en route to a 10-win season and a No. 6 final ranking in the Associated Press poll. The Trojans were riding high. Lane Kiffin was the hottest coach in the country and was a serious candidate for coach of the year honors.
Fast forward a year, and Troy is in chaos. USC is 7-4 and 5-4 in the Pac-12. It has have stumbled out of the Associated Press Top 25. It lost to UCLA for the first time in six years and just the second time in 14 years. And, worst of all, those misguided people who booked flights to Miami for the BCS Championship Game probably can’t get their money back.
It’s incredible what a year does. One second, everyone loves you. The next minute, you’re the most hated coach in Los Angeles. And that’s saying a lot.
So how did USC get here? And where do the Trojans go from here?
Defense is the answer for both.
The 2012 defense has been atrocious. You can’t give up 38 points to UCLA and 62 to Oregon. Thirty-nine to Arizona was embarrassing, too.
Everyone is quick to blame assistant head coach Monte Kiffin for the defensive struggles, and it’s true to an extent. USC has not played nearly as well as it should, given the fact the team has players such as sophomore linebackers Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard and a safety like senior T.J. McDonald.
But this is more of a problem with the other Kiffin on staff, Lane.
Here’s the thing: Lane Kiffin is not a defensive-minded coach. He is a number-cruncher. But it is defense-oriented coaches who win championships.
Look at Pete Carroll. USC had some of the best defenses in the country nearly every season, including a 2008 season where they gave up only nine points per game.
Look at Nick Saban. He has won two BCS national championships at Alabama and one at LSU behind stellar defenses. The offense was never the focal point of his teams, nor will it ever be. Even LSU’s Les Miles, who has the most inept offenses in the country, wins games because he cares about defense and builds his team around it.
Now, one might make the argument that offensive coaches can win, best exemplified by Oregon coach Chip Kelly. But the fact of the matter is that I have as many national championship rings as he does: none.
If the Trojans truly want to get back to a championship level, as I know Athletic Director Pat Haden does, they need a coach who cares more about defensive prowess than offensive firepower and breaking records. Having senior quarterback Matt Barkley throw 40 touchdown passes is fantastic. It’s fun to watch. Everyone loves seeing the scoreboard light up.
Until, that is, the other team scores 45 points and you lose by three.
Again, this isn’t an attack on Lane Kiffin; it’s just that his style doesn’t win championships. Cliche as it is, defenses win titles. Always have and always will.
The top three teams in the Associated Press poll are Notre Dame, Alabama and Georgia. The Fighting Irish and Crimson Tide’s defenses are tied for first in points per game allowed (10.1), while Georgia’s is a decent 18th overall. USC’s? 48th. That type of defense will not win a championship, and as long as Lane Kiffin is coach, I don’t think his priority will ever be fixing that unit.
That’s why this experiment should probably come to an end: Lane Kiffin needs to be let go as USC’s head coach.
I don’t think it will happen. Kiffin has done great things during these sanctioned times and gave hope to a huge fan base. But here’s the reality: USC can puddle around in mediocrity, or they can become true contenders by changing their philosophy to one focused on shutting offenses down.
There are plenty of coaches around who preach defense that would be fine candidates for the USC head coaching job. Charlie Strong, the head coach at Louisville, coached two national championship defenses as the defensive coordinator at Florida. Jack Del Rio is a former linebacker at USC and had decent success at the professional level. Even Jon Gruden — yes, that Jon Gruden — built his career in the NFL on strong defenses and has a Super Bowl ring to show for it.
Lane Kiffin is a great offensive mind. He has proven that by having offenses that always put up a lot of points. But he is probably better served as being an assistant coach at a school, as an offensive coordinator who doesn’t have to worry about what a defense does on a day-to-day basis. But he’s a head coach who cares more about scoring touchdowns than he does about the points his team gives up.
When a coach is seemingly more concerned with numbers than the actual game itself, it might be time to part ways.

The year is an awful one for USC.  You all know that the plays that have been called all year on the offense and defense were awful.  Yes, Pete was fantastic but with all our money and our fantastic fans we need better.  We deserve better and we can get better coaching.  Pat Hayen can be behind Kiffin all he wants but we should have a say on how the next year goes. How is it possible with all the talent we have that we are shamed in front of all.  The buck stops with the coaching.
Its time for a change to have a new coach. Our crosstown rival made it to the top 20 with less known players. And it’s his 1st year coaching.
You are delusional…. just who better to bring us back???  Anyone come to mind that “gets USC”???  I think you are still annoyed that Lane isn’t Pete.  Have you all forgotten the NCAA meant to cripple us for a decade??? Stop acting spoiled…. remember we all love to win.  It’s incredibly hard work with the sanctions, but no one in the athletic department is making excuses.  Fight on!!!
Fight ON!

PASADENA, Calif. — Despite speculation that his job is in jeopardy, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced  following Saturday’s 38-28 loss to crosstown rival UCLA that he will be back on the sidelines for the Trojans in 2013.
Hot seat · USC coach Lane Kiffin has received much criticism for USC’s 7-4 record in 2012. He says, though, that he will return next season. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Kiffin told reporters during his post-game news conference at the Rose Bowl he had been assured by Athletic Director Pat Haden he would keep his job.
A USC spokesperson confirmed that such a conversation between Haden and Kiffin had taken place. Haden also confirmed the account via text message to ESPNLosAngeles.com.
“Absolutely,” Haden responded, when asked if Kiffin would remain with the program.
Though it began the season ranked atop the Associated Press top-25 poll, USC is now unranked and  is also the first preseason No. 1 team to lose at least four regular season games since 1984, when Auburn finished 9-4. Should they remain unranked, the Trojans would also carry the dubious distinction of being the first preseason AP No. 1 team to fall outside the top 25 since Ole Miss went 5-5-1 in 1964.
“Obviously, we’re extremely disappointed in this season,” Kiffin said. “We’re too talented to have this many losses. That falls on me.”
A former USC assistant coach from 2001-06, Kiffin left Tennessee after one season to replace Pete Carroll in January 2010 and is curently in the third year of a reported five-year contract.
The Trojans (7-4, 5-4) face No. 1 Notre Dame on Saturday at the Coliseum in their regular season finale, in addition to a potential bowl game.
When asked following the loss to UCLA if he was concerned about the impact the remaining stretch of games would have on his job status, Kiffin insisted he wasn’t.
“I’m not worried about it,” he said.
Under Kiffin, USC has gone 25-11 through nearly three seasons, including a 10-2 finish in 2011.
Stanford, UCLA, Berkeley, and Notre Dame could not be happier at this news. Lane Kiffin ruined Tennessee in one season. Admittedly that program was going down, but he destroyed it. Leave him at USC another year, and you will be down for the rest of the decade before someone can turn it around. And no, Tennessee, still looking for a coach that can clean up Kiffin’s mess there, would not rehire him if USC had done the smart thing and fired him. Considering Knoxville mulled the idea of naming a sewage treatment plant after him, they would not even hire him at minimum wage to clean the locker room toilets.
Kiffin will never amount to anything as a coach because he has no ethics.  Leaving him at USC even one more season risks the school getting mired deeper into trouble with new NCAA sanctions.  He will be fired at the end of the 2013 season, which will be a mediocre one at best.
Interesting. What I care about is this: I am a type 1 diabetic. My feet were going to be amputated. until I found a simple way to stop that from happening.  if you are a diabetic you need to read this blog:

No NCAAF team has gone pre-season ranked #1 to unranked in the final poll in 48 years. Forty-eight years. The last two? Mississippi (1964) and USC (1963). No team has done this twice in history, until this year under the Kiffin family empire. If this isn’t a strong case against this coaching staff, I don’t know what is. Haden has to get rid of these guys or he should be next on the chopping block. Haden, take a cue from the Lakers and Mike Brown these guys. We don’t tolerate losers in LA, especially when you are handed some of the best talent in the country.
http://www.collegepollarchive.com/football/ap/research/pre-final_num1.cfm
Here’s some thoughts: Defense coaches need to go; Kiffin needs to stop being the Offense coordinator — hire someone who knows spread offense and let them calls the plays; Keep Lane Kiffin since he’s such a successful recruiter. New coaches need to build a team. Currently, there’s not a great togetherness on this team. Look what Mora did at UCLA. Trojans need the same “coming togetherness”. I don’t think Kiffin can provide just now, too young. Remember Pete on the sidelines?  Fight on!
I’ve weathered almost 60 years of SC football, and I must say this is one of the most disappointing seasons. In the past we had sanctions, but the teams played like true Trojans. These season has been totally the opposite. A perfect example of this was when Wes Horton, a senior, hits UCLA’s qb and gets a personal foul. It showed how poorly these young men have been coached. Even special teams who in past games were the bright star played poorly. Since Haden has given Kiffin another year, we’re stuck. If as with this year the team shows no progress then the call for Kiffin to be fired should be pursued.
Haden’s 150% vote of confidence is an asinine statement at this time . He should wait until the season ends
to make judgment of the situation. Only from memory believe Tennessee under Kiffin had trouble scoring
much in the year he was there. They also lost to ucla at home that season. Look at the other major sports
at USC being both basketball teams , and baseball. Haden sits on his hands rather than making changes
afraid to buyout anyone’s contract.
NO NO NO…KIFFIN HAS TO GO…after yesterdays loss and just horrible defense…it is time for him to be fired…that simple…what Pat Haden is doing by keeping this incompetent fool as the head football coach is an insult to everyone at USC.

PASADENA, Calif. — Saturday didn’t turn out like 1974 for USC. Instead, it turned out like much of 2012.
On the game’s first snap, a hurried senior quarterback Matt Barkley looked to his left and fired a pass toward Marqise Lee. But the sophomore wide receiver and Heisman Trophy candidate was swarmed by two defenders, and the pass was snatched by UCLA cornerback Aaron Hester, who returned the interception 14 yards to the Trojans’ 17-yard line.
Picked apart · UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley scored two rushing touchdowns in the Bruins’ win over USC on Saturday. It marked just the second time in the last 14 tries UCLA had beaten the Trojans. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Four plays later, Brett Hundley snuck in on a 1-yard touchdown run, capping off the drive and giving the No. 17 Bruins the early 7-0 edge. Hundley, the team’s first-year starter at quarterback, helped guide UCLA (9-2, 6-2) to a quick 24-0 lead by the midway point of the second quarter. And that lead was never relinquished.
“I totally thought we were going to win that game — even down by the big score early,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “I thought it’d be like the Notre Dame-’SC game from years ago.”
But there would be no similar comeback victory over a heated rival, as was the case during the 1974 Trojan win over Notre Dame at the Coliseum, when USC trailed 24-0 during the second quarter before reeling off 55 straight points.
Instead, as has been the case throughout much of the season, USC (7-4, 5-4) failed to bounce back from the early deficit and fell 38-28 to crosstown rival UCLA for the first time since 2006 and just the second time since 1998 in front of an announced crowd of 83,277 at the Rose Bowl.
“The quarterback made a number of great throws in that run they had there,” Kiffin said of Hundley. “You have to give a lot of credit to him. It’s not easy to do in a game like that.”
Hundley, who would complete 22 of 30 passes for 234 yards and one touchdown on the afternoon, had his fair share of successes against the Trojans’ overwhelmed defensive front, especially during “that run” in the early moments. During the first quarter, the redshirt freshman lobbed a 17-yard touchdown pass to 6-foot-8 tight end Joseph Fauria as part of the early scoring barrage that put UCLA in position to snap its five-game losing streak to USC.
“He’s real fast, but he can also throw the ball,” said sophomore defensive tackle George Uko, who compared Hundley to former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks Vince Young and Cam Newton. “He’s only going to get better from here.”
With the win, UCLA, not USC, will now represent the South Division in the Pac-12 championship game, scheduled for Nov. 30.
Though playing from behind for most of the afternoon, USC’s offense did appear to be in position to pull off a come-from-behind win. Within the remaining minutes of the second quarter, Barkley threw touchdown passes on back-to-back drives: a 33-yard toss to freshman wide receiver Nelson Agholor and a 2-yard strike to sophomore tight end Randall Telfer.
As a result, the Trojans trailed 24-14 at halftime.
“We dug ourselves in a hole we couldn’t get out of, which is unfortunate,” said Barkley, who threw for 301 yards and three touchdowns, but also had two passes intercepted during the team’s third loss in the last four games.
Barkley, now with a career-high 15 interceptions this season, was later forced to leave the game during the fourth quarter after landing awkwardly on his right throwing shoulder following a sack by linebacker Anthony Barr. Redshirt freshman Max Wittek filled in at quarterback for the remainder of the game.
Though declining to provide any specific information regarding the injury he did leave the locker room with his right arm in an apparent sling and his status for the team’s regular season finale — Saturday against No. 1 Notre Dame — remains uncertain.
“I fought as hard as I could have fought,” Barkley said. “Plays were there, plays weren’t there. There were times I feel like we could have broken the game open, but it just didn’t happen.”
Several skilled position players put up their usual productive numbers. Lee finished with nine receptions for 158 yards and one touchdown, becoming the Pac-12 single-season leader in receiving yards with 1,605 yards through 11 games. Senior running back Curtis McNeal added 161 rushing yards on 21 carries.
But trailing 31-28 toward the end of the fourth quarter and needing a stop, the Trojans couldn’t quite get one. UCLA running back Johnathan Franklin found the end zone on a 29-yard run to cap off a nine-play drive that spanned more than 80 yards and put the game out of reach.
“We fired back,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said, “but we just didn’t do enough. They capitalized on opportunities and we didn’t.”

It’s hard to take a vampire movie seriously when vampires glitter in the sun and werewolves whimper like little puppies.
In fact, all hope for the Twilight series seemed lost after New Moon, when the whole ordeal involved insecure, angsty teens whining about their love (or lack thereof) for one another.
Father-daughter pair · Mackenzie Foy and Robert Pattinson star as Renesmee and Edward Cullen in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2. – | Photo by Andrew Cooper, courtesy of Summit Entertaiment
And Eclipse was, if anything, worse than its predecessor. By the third installment, the Twilight franchise became unredeemable. Not even a star like Dakota Fanning could save the series from its terrible acting, disappointing fight scenes and shoddy special effects.
In case Breaking Dawn Part 1, has been forgotten, the movie ends with Bella (Kristen Stewart) giving birth to her half-human, half-vampire child. Part 1, like the earlier movies, was a major disappointment. And it was definitely frustrating buying another ticket just to see the next installment of the inadequate storyline.
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 starts off the same way as the previous films, full of unintended humor and second-rate visual effects.
When the one-expression Bella awakes from her “transition” into a vampire, Edward (Robert Pattinson) looks at her like she’s a whole new person.
“You’re beautiful,” he tells her as he caresses her face and admires her pasty white skin, which is ironic given that Stewart, as Bella, looks exactly the same as always. If anything, she looks scarier with oily hair (clearly it hadn’t been washed for a few days while she was transitioning) and red eyes — although Edward seems pretty into that.
The special effects, which enhanced her transformation, should have improved by the last installment. After Edward’s admiration of the newly awoken Bella, the couple carries on with a romantic hunting adventure. But when they run through the forest at vampire speed, their faces look stationary while their feet move extraordinarily fast. It seems hard to believe there still isn’t a way to make this look more realistic.
But the poor visual effects are the least of the film’s problems. Anyone who read the Twilight series will become aware of the discomfort that surrounds Stephenie Meyer’s “imprinting” subplot between Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and Edward and Bella’s baby, Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). For Twilight’s werewolves, imprinting is an involuntary method by which they find their life partners, whether romantic or platonic. But given the large age-gap between Jacob and Renesmee — who is still in diapers at the beginning of Part 2 — this particular subplot was known for causing anxiety and, sometimes, outright laughter among readers.
Even the actors seem uncomfortable with this portion of the story. In scenes where Bella interacts with her daughter, the Cullen family awkwardly gathers in a living room with Jacob, Edward and Renesmee. They all sit together and smile uncomfortably like it’s some sort of freaky baby shower.
And Stewart and Pattinson are perhaps the most unconvincing parents possible; luckily, they have a whole family of vampires assisting them, especially considering that Bella seems more into jumping Edward than bonding with her daughter.
When it comes to Edward and Bella, it truly takes a village to raise a child. Thank goodness then, that Bella’s baby is cute. Maybe if there were an adorable baby in Eclipse, it would have been bearable.
But then something happens. As the film continues, the plot sharpens and draws viewers’ attention away from Part 2’s comedic elements.
The acting, of course, does not change or miraculously get better — Pattinson does not suddenly stop letting his English accent sneak through onto the screen. But as the story goes on, more dramatic events take place.
Renesmee’s transformation into a beautiful little girl is outright stunning. Even though Foy’s character doesn’t talk much, she remains quite pleasant to look at,  more pleasant than Stewart. It seems like the young actress might have a successful career in front of her, even if only for her onscreen charisma.
Moreover, instead of sitting around whining about minute problems, the Cullen family, in hopes of convincing the Volturi (the evil, powerful vampires) that Renesmee is not dangerous, travels around to convince other vampires to come to the little town of Forks. These vampires are an eclectic group of creatures,  ranging from Amazonian women to Arabian creatures. It’s intriguing to watch each vampire bring a different gift and personality to the story.
Interesting flashbacks, such as one in which Dakota Fanning’s character throws a vampire child into fire, are compelling, and despite the dark undertones of several scenes, the film convinces audiences that the Cullen family will live happily ever after when all is said and done.
These short anecdotes, of course, lead up to the huge confrontation between the Volturi and the Cullen clan. Despite what readers might have thought of the final conflict in the book version, the film depicts an intense fight scene that is actually quite interesting. At this point of Part 2, the film builds tension. Ignoring the dull quality of the franchise’s former installments, this installment proves that it’s capable of provoking emotional responses from viewers. And despite the slow, dragging nature of the film’s earlier scenes, the events near the end are entertaining and unpredictable — even for those who read the book not too long ago.
Yes, Part 2 is unnecessarily cliched. But though the film had a definite chance of disappointing, it surprisingly impresses. The beginning is comical, yet the movie as a whole remains fulfilling — perhaps because of the redeeming, happy-ever-after ending (it’s a shocker: Edward and Bella live happily ever after).
Breaking Dawn Part 2, is definitely the best of the Twilight movies. And if you’ve already suffered through the previous installments, there’s no harm in seeing the last — you might even be pleasantly surprised. If not, hey, there’s pretty scenery to look at, a cool battle scene and some serious moments that can provide you with a few laughs.
Go die.
i went to see this movie today and it was so GREAT!!!! I already want to watch it again!!!!

Thanksgiving might not be accompanied by catchy tunes or the sponsorship of an iconic patron saint, but it is a holiday centered on food, and you really can’t go wrong with that. We all have our favorite dishes that we look forward to because, for some odd reason, it just doesn’t seem right trying to recreate them any other time of the year.
It is this enormous feast, however, that can be a cause of worry for many college students reluctant to discuss their college experiences. The idea of communion abounds on this day — communion here meaning the exchange of food and love and all of that good stuff that makes our stomachs full and our eyes drowsy. On this November holiday, we share a table with close friends and family in a display of kinship and gratitude.
When you think about it, though, more than just food is  shared. The communal aspect of the Thanksgiving meal invites us to share with others ideas and thoughts along with stuffing and cranberry sauce. For this reason, going home for Thanksgiving break invites the dreaded question: “So what have you been up to all semester?”
This query spells danger for various reasons, all of which depend on the individual. Maybe you don’t want to tell everybody how your classes are extremely difficult and no matter how much you try, you just can’t seem to get a grade that meets your high standards. Or, it could be that you’ve been engaging in less-than-academic behavior that just doesn’t constitute acceptable table talk. It’s also possible you’re considering switching majors from something concrete and legitimate-sounding to a field of study that’s more abstract and less reassuring to the scrutinizing parental checkbook.
There’s no need to worry, though. Whatever the case, all you have to do is strategically focus on what you have been doing right. Steer the conversation into safer waters when the topics start to get a little choppy. Thanksgiving dinner can easily become an extended, face-to-face version of those nerve-racking phone calls home, during which you’re obligated to update your family on all of the details they miss when you’re not under their jurisdiction.
To prevent the spillage of nasty details, consider whether the topic at hand is really something you need to be sharing. I’m not condoning lying at all — just suggesting that not every aspect of our lives on and off campus has to be divulged. As college students, we are embracing a new responsibility in which we solve our own problems. It’s scary and not always possible — help from home is sometimes acceptable or necessary — but we should be making an effort to be self-sufficient. How else will we prove to our families that we’re actually maturing during our time away from home?
Honesty remains the best policy, but Thanksgiving is all about the meal — and one wrong comment can really ruin the entire evening. Prying questions into touchy subjects can be a one-way ticket to disaster.
If tough subjects are impossible to avoid, take solace in the fact that everyone else is in the same boat. After a semester of being at school, basking in the freedom of collegiate life, most students find it a daunting task to return home — even if it’s only for a few days.
Despite the potential danger of sitting down with your family on Thanksgiving, there is, of course, much to look forward to. Besides the carb-loaded extravaganza that awaits your stomach, Thanksgiving gives college students their first real break of the year.
Suffering through the last sweltering days of August and trudging through September, October and November finally brings us to an extended weekend where it’s possible to kick back and relax — unless your professors actually assign some sort of work over break. If that’s the case, it’s only appropriate that you honor proper Turkey Day spirit and leave it to the last minute. I heard on Animal Planet that turkeys are lazy or something, so don’t feel bad taking my advice.
For those of us who hail from somewhere other than sunny SoCal, your trip back home will also allow you the privilege of an actual season. Having grown up in beach cities all my life, the concept of a crispy orange leaf is sadly foreign to me. So those of you going home to this natural phenomenon should buy a pumpkin-spiced drink and enjoy the fiery tree residue.
Speaking of where we all come from, not everyone goes home for Thanksgiving. The all-important meal held at the end of November is also a time for roommates and close friends to invite each other over or even dare to attempt their own turkey feast. Though the latter is a risky effort I’ve yet to attempt, I’ve definitely brought several friends home over the years. It’s a fun experience and I highly recommend it. Bringing home out-of-state friends enables the opportunity to embrace new traditions. Maybe you have a vegan friend who you want to bring home, which presents the chance to try out some bold alternative Turkey Day recipes. Thus the regular holiday routines that are so easily followed without question are challenged.
As students just beginning to grapple with the technicalities of adulthood, we must remember what’s important about Thanksgiving: the time we share with our families and friends. From avoiding awkward table conversation to organizing dinner guest arrangements, Thanksgiving requires some serious planning. Who wants to have arguably the best meal of the year ruined? Save it for Christmas. That holiday always gets ruined anyway.

Thanksgiving, in many senses, is the quintessential American holiday. Families come together to eat, lounge around, laugh and most importantly, watch football. The Macy’s Day Parade and mental preparation for the chaos of Black Friday also define the day.
USC students readily welcome this relaxed Thanksgiving, especially since it serves as the only break during the fall semester. And with its arrival during the 13th week of school, many students are more than ready to leave campus and return home to their families to celebrate.
Yet for the university’s international students, the holiday takes on a different meaning. Of the 17,500 undergraduate students at USC, international students comprise 12.3 percent of the student body. They represent more than 115 different countries, and all of them bring different experiences. But despite the  wide variety of these experiences, few bring the tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving every fourth Thursday of November.
Chau Vu, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, moved from south Vietnam to America when she was in ninth grade. Her first Thanksgiving was spent with an American classmate in Wisconsin.
“In Vietnam, we have days when extended family comes together to celebrate with us, but nothing like Thanksgiving,” Vu said. “What I got from my first Thanksgiving was that there was so much turkey and I got to eat so much food.”
Many international students cite the abundance of food as being a key element of how they celebrate the holiday. The additional days off from school are an additional reason why Thanksgiving holds importance to students who come from abroad.
Eduardo Dillon, a freshman majoring in industrial engineering, moved from Mexico to attend USC. Dillon, though aware of the holiday, was uncertain about the significance of it to Americans.
To some Americans, the holiday has indeed lost its significance — a day originally dedicated to gratitude. Thanksgiving was a historical holiday, but through the years, the day has become much more commercialized. Instead of focusing on spending time with family members, many Americans look forward to the holiday sales at major department stores and plan strategies for snagging deals on Black Friday. Some lasting traditions, such as eating turkey and dressing, however, remain remaining strong. With all of these changes, the significance of the day for international students becomes even more elusive.
Still, many students are eager to better understand the holiday while in college. Some go home with their college friends to celebrate Thanksgiving with their friends’ family, which  affords them the opportunity of having a traditional Thanksgiving experience.
Flora Bolonyai, a sophomore majoring in economics and math, is a native of Hungary. Bolonyai moved to America a year and a half ago to attend college at USC. As a member of the women’s water polo team, she has had the opportunity to interact with her American teammates and their families’ holiday traditions.
“Last year, I went home with one of my teammates and I celebrated with her family,” Bolonyai said. “We had a traditional Thanksgiving meal and ate turkey and had pumpkin pie. Experiencing all of that for the first time was actually really fun.”
Though many Americans eat their way through the day with their family’s classic dishes and customs, many first-year international students are creating their own meaningful traditions. Some of their traditions might not resemble Charlie Brown’s iconic Thanksgiving,  but many international students adjust their observance of Thanksgiving to the holidays of their native culture.
Anders Ho, a senior majoring in international relations global business, grew up in Hong Kong. While living there, he attended both a British-system school and an American-style school, where he was exposed to Thanksgiving.
“I mean obviously it’s more festive here than in Hong Kong, but I think it’s just about who I’m celebrating with,” Ho said. “When I celebrate it here with my cousins in America it’s more traditional and larger. In Hong Kong it’s fun times but more chill.”
Though international students are willing to celebrate the Thanksgiving season while matriculating through their college years, there is reason to believe this attitude might be temporary.
“I feel like that now that I know what it’s all about I’m celebrating it because I’m here,” Bolonyai said. “But if I’m with people from my country, like in the future when I’m not in the U.S., I won’t celebrate.”
Other international students who are newer to America believe that the traditions they are building now will continue after their time at USC. Xiaojie Wang, a freshman majoring in anthropology, moved from Shanghai to Los Angeles this summer to attend USC. He plans on observing Thanksgiving in the years to come.
“I want to learn about American culture and that’s one important part about it,” Wang said. “I will keep celebrating Thanksgiving because I study here, and I should live like people do here.”
Similarly, other students recognize the newfound significance the holiday can have in their lives.
“It makes you remember that this a country of freedom and people come here for a better life. The same reason why people came here in the 1700s is happening today,” Dillon said. “It’s a land of liberty and diversity and it’s still happening. Since it’s my first Thanksgiving here, it’s repeating what happened back then. I can see a connection.”
The meaning behind the Thanksgiving season, though sometimes lost on those looking into the American culture, resonates with students from all backgrounds. Regardless of how they celebrate, international students realize that quality time spent with loved ones and a break from the rigor of life lie at the heart of the holiday.
“It’s great that they give us a little break before finals,” Bolonyai said. “I think that family festivities and holidays are important. It’s good how the whole family gets together, and I like the idea.”

If literature has proven one thing over and over again, it’s that love is epic, beautiful and, more than anything else, tragic. Whether it’s Romeo losing his Juliet, Odysseus sailing away from Penelope or Elizabeth Bennett’s prejudices against Mr. Darcy, great romances always come at a price.
Period piece · Keira Knightly stars as the titular character in Joe Wright’s adaptation of the Leo Tolstoy novel Anna Karenina, which follows the love triangle between an aristocrat, her young lover and her watchful husband. – | Photo by Laurie Sparham, courtesy of Focus Features
Anna Karenina is the latest film adaptation of one of these great love stories, based on world-renowned Russian author Leo Tolstoy’s 800-page novel of the same name. There have been several movies based on the book, but this year’s version (directed by Joe Wright) proves to be the boldest vision of them all: The way and style in which the story is told is much more important and resonating than the story itself.
Anna (Keira Knightley) is the wife of an important Russian minister (Jude Law) and could not ask for anything else from her high-class life. But when she starts an affair with the younger Count Vronsky (Aaron Johnson) and the spite of society falls upon her, she faces decisions that could potentially destroy everything she has ever known.
Set against the background of a tragic romance, the storyline deals with profound topics, such as the definition of happiness and  the consequences of sacrificing everything for love. Though the 130-minute run time certainly could have been trimmed down a bit (especially at the end, where it drags), these themes are conveyed successfully, thanks largely to some wonderful and devoted performances by the film’s cast.
Wright is back to directing period pieces (his last feature was the crime thriller Hanna in 2011) and brings his muse Knightley along, after having collaborated with her in the critically acclaimed Pride & Prejudice and Atonement. It is evident now that this pair can make magic when they are given a good novel to work with.
Knightley feels more than comfortable in the skin of yet another high-class woman trapped between the conventions of society and her heart. Even though she’s starting to get type-cast in these period roles, her performance here is the best one she’s given in years, and it would be no surprise if it earns her an Oscar nomination.
Aaron Johnson (whose only major role before this was the teenage superhero in Kick Ass) gives a stellar performance as Count Vronsky, Anna’s love interest and the catalyst for much of the film’s action. He and Knightley develop, against all odds, a very good and believable chemistry onscreen.
Jude Law, who holds a slightly smaller part than one would expect, proves he has outgrown his previous playboy image into more mature roles. Equally good performances by Kelly MacDonald, Matthew Macfadyen and Alicia Vikander, just to name a few, also round out the film.
But though the plotline raises some very interesting questions and the performances are nothing but exceptional, the overwhelmingly stylized visuals overshadow everything else, for better and for worse.
By turning the movie into a bizarre and unique “half film/half theatre” mash-up, Wright makes one of the riskiest and most daring creative decisions that Hollywood has seen in recent years. The entirety of the film’s actions develops inside a worn-down theater that changes scenery and props according to scene, and the characters work around it as if it were a play.
This is a bit baffling at first, but once the viewer gets used to it, the style never stops dazzling. The way the set transforms from a ballroom to a horse race stadium and then into an ice rink is breathtaking. There are a couple of sequences, such as the visually stunning dance scene in which Anna and Count Vronsky first meet, that will stick in the viewer’s mind long after leaving the theater.
To complement the tremendous production design, which will undoubtedly garner more than one award, the period costumes are exquisite, and the music perfectly supplements the turbulent yet refined life in Imperial Russia. Overall, Anna Karenina is a feast for the senses, more than anything else.
Audiences who expect a profound reflection about the psyche of love in 17th century Russia will probably be disappointed by the flashiness of the spectacle. Others who are open-minded to alternative forms of narrative, however, will be very pleased (although certainly overwhelmed) with the theatrical design of the movie.
Anna Karenina will not be remembered for being a faithful adaptation of Tolstoy’s epic tragedy. It will, however, resonate loudly with audiences, critics and award committees because of Knightley’s committed performance and the film’s spectacular visual design, even if it meant renouncing the heart of Tolstoy’s work that could have very well been included. But some things must be sacrificed for Hollywood. Love is tragic, after all.

Many people, Democrats and Republicans alike, dismiss Texas Rep. Ron Paul as a crazy old man whose support for the sale of unpasteurized milk and call for a return to the gold standard render him and his ideas unworthy of serious consideration. But luckily, an increasing number of young people have looked past this flippant view to embrace Paul’s vision of a limited government shaped by free-market principles and a stringent dedication to civil liberties.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
After 23 years in congressional office, Paul is retiring at the end of the year. His humble yet inspiring farewell address before Congress last Wednesday should remind students that in order for the United States be restored as a nation that truly espouses principles of liberty, they must be the ones to carry forward his legacy through political activism and efforts to raise awareness.
In his farewell address, the 77-year-old Republican congressman leveled blows at both dominant political parties, suggesting that both sides’ unwillingness to cut spending from their parties’ high-priority projects means that the deep budgetary hole the United States has dug itself into is not likely to be filled anytime soon.
“One side doesn’t give up one penny on military spending, the other side doesn’t give up one penny on welfare spending … and the downward spiral continues,” he said.
Where partisan politicians have refused to break from their one-track party molds, Paul has avoided being confined to such a limited mindset. Though he is a Republican by official affiliation, he breaks from his colleagues by refusing to stand by superfluous military spending and antiquated immigration policies. And though he never fits neatly within one party platform, his positions display a level of consistency that is rare, even among the most die-hard Republicans and Democrats.
What Paul believes in and has always promoted is a commitment to common sense principles of unfettered free markets and a commitment to individual rights. In short, he stands for liberty.
Paul’s farewell address and exit from Congress come at a crucial point of crossroads in American politics. In addition to partisan gridlock, the government is cracking down on the most fundamental civil liberties granted by the Constitution through legislation that borders on the tyrannical.
Perhaps the explosion of Ron Paul mania in our generation is a result of growing up in the post-9/11 security state. We live in the shadow of constitutionally dubious laws, such as the PATRIOT Act and the National Defense Authorization Act, both of which provide the government with unprecedented powers including the indefinite detention of citizens and the suspension of due process rights for detainees — all in the name of national security.
Young Paul supporters see the grave danger inherent in the indiscriminate expansion of executive power, which has the potential to undermine the values and beliefs that America has historically stood for. What has separated the United States from other nations and made it an exemplar of democratic values for the world is its constitutional dedication to civil liberties and the protection of the individual from government tyranny, but this has been eroded in the past decade. Our generation is the one that will reap the consequences if we fail to speak out against this erosion now.
During his farewell speech, Paul lamented the lack of enthusiasm for liberty among his colleagues in Congress, but expressed optimism at the fact that “tens of thousands of teenagers and college age students” have taken up the torch of liberty “with great enthusiasm.”
Though it is regrettable that most politicians and citizens do not agree with Paul’s platform, it is time that our generation pick up where he left off and work toward restoring the founding principles of the Constitution.
Students shouldn’t feel uncomfortable defending an unconventional candidate or standing up for civil liberties at a protest. Our future depends on a fundamental change in how government is run, and there is no better time than now for resurrecting liberty, Ron Paul style.
 
Sarah Cueva is a junior majoring in political science and Middle East studies. Her column “Leaning Toward Liberty” runs Mondays.
It is worth pointing out that Paul has been connected to racist, homophobic, and misogynistic writings and ideas for decades. He’s all more freedom when it applies to the wealthy white people that populate the world he lives in.  The fact is that in this country the color of your skin strongly correlates to the opportunities that are open to you. I am a white male who grew up in an upper middle class community with good school, but I’m not so selfish to pretend that because I had every opportunity open to me if I put in an effort, that my situation is true for non-white and lower class people if they worked harder.
Ron Paul lives in a fantasy world of ideas that only sound good if your life has been privileged enough that you have need assistance for the government.
In a globalized world his ideas about eliminating federal agencies like the EPA and the fed are beyond idiotic and would lead to disaster if they came to pass.
His recent comments on secession? Let the red states go, they are by and by large states which pay less in to federal coffers than they receive.
Paul and his hateful son Rand are blights on our political system, I’m happy to see Paul go, and I really wish Rand makes a strong run for the Republican nomination in 2016 as most Americans do not agree with his world view.
Small government sounds great until you think about the details. Living in America would SUCK without a strong federal government, but apparently libertarians have ignored or forgotten Silent Spring, the BP Oil Spill, the Jungle and so many other example.
Libertarians are an embarrassment on political thought. Stop being so naive.
We are still debating the gold standard?  I thought that had been settled long ago in the elections of 1896 and 1900 (William Jennings Bryan vs. William McKinley).
As far as I know there is no country in the world that still uses it.
Go away you old bag!   If we want useless nonsense, we will check Wikipedia.
Quite. It’s a terrible idea.
Ron Paul in not some flash in the pan.  He has a successful career and a not-so-successful career. The idea of peace is out of style now, but it will become popular again. The idea that liberty is better than slavery should rise in popularity also. If students are satisfied with large chunks of their take home pay disappearing into a nebulous government, then they deserve lifetime poverty. If students don’t care about keeping personal things private, then they deserve 1984. If banks can have massive infusions of “money” without student protest, then they don’t deserve the gold that cannot be counterfeited.
The whole Ron Paul infatuation is so lame. Anyone who knows anything about economics knows that a return to the Gold Standard would be an unmitigated disaster. And the ‘End the Fed’ thing is sophomoric too. Anyone in doubt should read George Cooper’s book on the financial crisis: http://post.nyssa.org/nyssa-news/2011/05/book-review-the-origin-of-financial-crises-central-banks-credit-bubbles-and-the-efficient-market-fal.html
The frustrating thing with Ron Paul is that he has taken many people justifiably concerned with civil liberties onto the political fringe when they should be promoting those policies (and lobbying through things like the ACLU) within the mainstream. Ron Paul’s 15 minutes are now up. Finally.
johnny boy,  your george cooper is a farce!
“wants to get back to our Country’s Fundamental roots, go back to following the United States Constitution and Constitutional law, back to the glory and prestige we once had.”
“George Cooper is a Washington outsider, not all caught up in the mindset game of closed door dealings and trying to please the lobbyist.”
he sounds like a plantation owner that has a stable full of slaves and a good little wife that knows her place!
This country needs to go back to the gold standard…………. Ron Paul has very great ideas and had he been given the opportunity to be president of the usa, we would be 100x better off than we are today!
What a strange comment. George Cooper has been studying (and making money from understanding) monetary policy for several decades. His book got rave reviews but is easily understandable for those who really want to understand bubbles and crashes. Calling him a ‘plantation owner’ (he’s British btw) really says more about you than him.
A better idea plays a very important role in making your college party more memorable and exited, if if you are the organizer of your college party then you can contact party planners to make your party more rocking . So College Party Tips is also the one of the major experienced organization that planned lots of college parties.

The presidential election on Nov. 6 was more than just the United States choosing a new leader; in a way, it was a referendum on American society.
Despite close races and post-election threats to secede from the country over an Obama victory,  the election showed that Americans prefer a progressive society and want to keep the country a social democracy.
Though the election ended in an electoral landslide for President Barack Obama, the popular vote was relatively close. Beyond that, however, many progressive voting measures won out, particularly some of the highest-profile ones.
Maine, Maryland and Washington all voted to legalize same-sex marriages. Washington and Colorado legalized recreational marijuana use. Both Montana and Colorado voted to reject Citizens United, the Supreme Court case that allowed corporations to make unlimited campaign contributions. Exit polls also showed that almost half of voters are in favor of raising taxes on Americans who make more than $250,000 per year, according to Politico.
All of these changes fly in the face of the last 30 years of political rhetoric. Since 1980, the political narrative that has characterized the United States as a “center-right” country. During that decade, former president Ronald Reagan called for a vast reduction in government and taxes, deeming such concepts wasteful and urging a return to a deregulated economy. The conservative movement ran with this, mythologizing it into a grand story of the country. It’s this idea that campaign videos and speeches have hammered into the public mindset, beginning in the Reagan era and continuing through the 2012 election. And yet, the results of this election demonstrate that the idea of American government as conservative and laissez-faire is a myth, not reality.
In reality, the United States is a social democracy — one where the government provides some universal public services — and has been for years.
Progressive policies in the early 20th century gave American citizens weekends, 40-hour work weeks, child labor laws and regulations that, among other pesky details, try to make sure that our food and water aren’t toxic. The United States tried laissez-faire capitalism once during the 1920s, and it didn’t work. Without social safety nets, thousands were left with no one to turn to during the Great Depression.
So the progressive policies that politicians like Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan might espouse today as evil government measures aren’t some rarity. They’re part of the core of modern American society, and we need them in order to have a functioning democracy.
The myth of a conservative, Norman Rockwell-esque United States is also closely tied to the concept of the American Dream, which in and of itself tends to be overused as a go-to talking point by politicians. But including progressive ideals in the American Dream bolsters the concept that anyone, no matter where they come from, can work hard and succeed in the United States; that anyone, no matter where they come from, will be given a fair playing field to do so, and they won’t be punished for failing.
That isn’t socialism. It certainly isn’t communism. And it in no way means that freedoms are in danger from government tyranny. That’s a progressive society that boasts a mixed market and social programs, but also respects civil rights and liberties.
The 2012 election showed that these ideas matter, with a rejection of Tea Party politics and a renewed commitment to  fighting corporate influence, protecting social programs and promoting forward-thinking policies.
The United States is a much more liberal and progressive society than many think. Is it a socialist state? No — but it’s a social democracy that has grown more inclusive over the years. Despite attempts to spin the country’s narrative to a more austere and conservative track, last week’s election is a strong sign that the United States doesn’t want to give into that rhetoric, but rather challenge it.

Progressive does not equal better for the country. It only empowers the needy and weaken the strong. Ultimately, the country fails. Look at Europe and Greece. The only thing this country has become is progressively stupid.
Nicholas it seems the weed smoke has gotten to your head. After the Obama hangover following 4 more years of +7.5% unemployment, and economic growth that doesn’t keep pace with population growth, people will realize the mistake they made with this guy and resort back to the policies that have driven strong economic growth for the past 30 years.
Someone obviously didn’t look at the electoral map. Just because a few pot-smokers in Colorado managed to get out the vote on one day out of the year does not mean the beginning of a new progressive movement.
How about a constitutional amendment that prohibits wars paid for with credit cards?
It is precisely the Federal Reserve System that allows unlimited borrowing and monetary creation. Returning to the gold or some other commodity based standard should limit the options for unlimited war. And the bonus is that gold & silver are already in the Constitution!
The D Party victory illustrates that a majority of people think that there is no problem with borrowing close to one’s annual income, every year. These same people want someone else to pick up their tab. It worked for four years. How much longer can it work when our interest bill is half a trillion? If interest rates go up to 4%, the payments will be over $1,000,000,000,000 every year. I predict the spending binge is nearly over. Math is reality. Embrace reality.
Amen, brother.
