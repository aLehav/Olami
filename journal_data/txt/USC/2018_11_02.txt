Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Y a llegó Noviembre. It’s finally November. With Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s and the day of the Virgen de Guadalupe just weeks away, the start of the holiday season marks the beginning of what I like to call tamal season.
The delicious corn husk-wrapped delicacies make their yearly appearance in the homes of thousands of Latinos — specifically Mexicans — as winter approaches. 
For my family in particular, tamales are a reminder of Mexico — a homeland my parents haven’t returned to in over 25 years. As the aroma of cooking tamales reaches their noses, their minds fill with nostalgia and memories of their old lives.
As my mom reminisced about her childhood, she would repeat stories I now have memorized of her time growing up at el rancho. As we gather around the kitchen table to spread masa on a corn husk, she’d describe how she and her family lived pobres pero con mucho amor (poor, but with lots of love). 
The economic struggles my mom’s family faced never defined her childhood — they were no more than a small part of it. Her family could only afford to make tamales during times of economic stability. She’d contrast making tamalitos with eating tacos de mantequilla con sal — literally butter spread on a warm tortilla with a sprinkle of salt — when things weren’t going so great, but told stories of good times and bad with a smile on her face.
I remember waking up to the cough-inducing smell of chile ancho toasting on the comal as my grandma prepared the corn masa, essentially a corn-based dough that envelops the meat in red sauce, or chile, to perfection, and my mom cooked the meat and chopped the queso fresco for what would soon become the tamale’s filling.
As the only child in the house, I was always tasked with the least appealing part of tamal-making: washing the husks and removing the “hairs.” 
Ask any first-generation Mexican kid. We’ve all had to do it. The laborious process — which feels especially strenuous to 10-year-olds — involves soaking dozens of corn husks in warm water and removing each little red pelo de elote from every individual husk.
Biting into a savory tamal and feeling its fuzz in your mouth makes the whole experience unpleasant and takes away from the beauty of arguably the best food in Mexican cuisine, so despite my complaints, I understood the importance of my job.
As a first-generation American, making tamales has brought me closer to my Mexican roots and my family. The tamal is a delicious symbol of unity during the holiday season, since everyone in the house is involved in both creating and eating the delicious Mexican specialty. 
Tamales also are a reminder of family tradition. Every Mexican family will tell you they make the best tamales. I am biased, but my Mamá Toña’s recipe for masa will always be the best.
Recipes for the masa and for chile rojo and rajas vary from household to household as abuelitas and tías modify recipes that span generations. The processes and tastes are slightly different depending on who makes them, but for Mexican immigrants, they are always a reminder of home.

The annual celebration of Día de Los Muertos has returned, and Los Angeles has put its own spin on the traditional Mexican holiday. From Oct. 27 to Nov. 3, Grand Park, in partnership with Self Help Graphics & Art and LORE Media & Arts, presented 50 altars and art installations created by local artists and community groups under the theme “Looking to the Past to Build the Future.”
Each year, people in Mexico and around the world observe the holiday, which coincides with All Saints’ and All Souls’ Day. The celebration centers on remembering friends, family and loved ones who have passed away. On Día de Los Muertos, the dead are awakened from their sleep and welcomed to rejoin the community through the memories of the living.
Events typically take place from Oct. 31 through Nov. 2 — tradition says that the gates of heaven open at midnight on Oct. 31, and the spirits of all deceased children are allowed to reunite with their families for 24 hours. On Nov. 2, the spirits of adults come down to enjoy the festivities that are prepared for them. Cemeteries, homes and public spaces await the annual visit of the dearly departed. Traditions connected with the holiday include visiting graves with offerings, photos and possessions; building private and public altars; and honoring the deceased with items such as marigolds, sugar skulls and the favorite foods of the departed.
For this, Self Help Graphics & Art produced over 1,000 art prints editions, including 54 atelier projects and exhibitions all over the world. The organization remains dedicated to the production, interpretation and distribution of prints and other art media by Chicana/o and Latinx artists. 
The organization says its multidisciplinary, intergenerational programs help to promote artistic excellence and empower the community by providing access to working space, tools, training and more. Now, nearly half a century later, SHG continues to foster emerging Chicana/o and Latinx artists through a world-class printmaking studio and support the role of artists as leaders, both within its organizations and the community. 
Ni Santas, an art collective run by women of color, presented an altar that recognized the plight of children crossing the border. 
A main attraction was a large installation depicting the Lady of the Dead with nine decorated vessels in a fountain, curated and created by artist Marcus Pollitz.
“Dedicated to loved ones past and the prospect of rebirth, the vessels are adorned with elements associated with the four directions. Among the offerings is the iconic image of the “Lady of the Dead,” Pollitz said. “She rides atop a decorated floating vessel filled with marigolds and elements associated with the four directions. The Catrina is both the guiding vessel for the accompanying floral altars and the whimsical focal points of this tribute to our dearly departed.”
The exhibit will remain at Grand Park until Nov. 3 — admission is free.

When asked what he was most excited for audience members to see in Musical Theatre Repertory’s production of “Avenue Q,” freshman Reese Dawkins, who plays Nicky, had a simple answer: “Puppet sex.” 
The infamously bawdy musical opened at the Massman Theater Thursday, and is the first show in MTR’s 14th season of student-produced musicals. 
“Avenue Q” won Best Musical at the Tony Awards in 2004, beating the phenomenally successful “Wicked.” Its script is a heartfelt and hilarious dive into the anxieties of adulthood -— through the lives of puppets.  
Princeton, the show’s protagonist, moves to Avenue Q — the grown-up version of “Sesame Street” — with only a bachelor’s degree in English on his belt. He meets Kate Monster, a kindergarten assistant teacher, Rod, a Republican banker and Nicky, Rod’s lazy roommate. 
With the help of supporting characters such as Lucy the Slut and Gary Coleman, they brave the labyrinth of adulthood and yearn for the simplicity of college life. 
Director Sean Soper, a senior majoring in business administration, said he originally wanted to direct “Avenue Q” because he could relate to Princeton’s emotional turbulence as a soon-to-be college graduate.
“I feel that struggle that Princeton is going through,” Soper said. “When we’re in college we feel like we can conquer the world.”
Most of the characters are played by actors who speak through a Jim Henson-style puppet. Three characters, including Coleman, are played by humans, but in true “Sesame Street” style, humans and puppets coexist harmoniously.   
Liz Buzbee, a senior majoring in theatre, plays Kate and said her biggest challenge has been operating the puppets in a manner that does justice to the story. The original Broadway cast featured a number of professional puppeteers, but MTR’s cast members learned to puppeteer as a group. 
“[A production] in which you’re looking at the actor’s face more than the puppet’s face is a failed production,” Buzbee said. “You want to look at the puppet and then look at the actor for reference.” 
With a score by Jeff Marx and “Frozen”’ composer Robert Lopez that features songs like “Schadenfreude,” “Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist” and “You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want When You’re Makin’ Love,” “Avenue Q” taps into the fundamental struggles of adulthood. 
How can you know if the mixtape your neighbor gave you was a sign of romantic interest? And what is the internet really for? (The latter is answered matter-of-factly in the raunchy number “The Internet is for Porn.”) 
“Underneath the shock value and gimmick, which is puppets cussing, there is such a beating heart about adulthood,” said Dawkins, a freshman majoring in cinema and media studies. 
Dawkins said that “Avenue Q” acts as an antidote to negativity, especially in the current political climate. 
He credited Soper for bringing forward the sincerity of “Avenue Q” as a director. Soper has been involved with MTR for two years, and Dawkins said he is excited for audience members to find out what “Avenue Q” is really about, especially since the show is widely known for its raunchiness.  
“I’m excited for people to cry so hard from laughing, and also cry a little bit from the emotion of it,” Soper said. 
Soper and musical director Austin Karkowsky said the talented 10-student cast has made their jobs easier.
“We have so much fun together and they bring something new to the table every day, which I really appreciate,” said Karkowsky, a sophomore majoring in theatre. 
Reservations are no longer available online, but students are encouraged to arrive early and join the waitlist.

With over 24 different types of beer on tap, Rock ’n Reilly’s is a welcoming, affordable addition to USC Village’s current lineup of restaurants. It becomes 21+ when USC plays. (Sasha Urban | Daily Trojan)
It’s Tuesday night, and Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” blasts as customers bite into their burgers and sip their spirits. The restaurant’s rustic appearance suggests traditions of beer chugging, and the cheers of sports echo off the walls — yet,  the restaurant just opened last Wednesday. 
Rock & Reilly’s, USC Village’s new gastropub, is a sight for sore wallets in the complex’s lineup of pricy dining options. The latest addition to the brand’s upscale pubs in and around Los Angeles, USC Village Rock & Reilly’s has been named the chain’s newest location. After its first night serving hundreds of Trojans on Oct. 27, the restaurant shows strong promise of becoming a hotspot for foodies and sports fans alike.   
At first glance, Rock & Reilly’s has all the staple qualities of a pub: a devotion to ’80s rock, dim lighting and a seemingly infinite selection of beers. But Rock & Reilly’s sets itself apart with one pleasant surprise: a second, completely plant-based menu that mirrors its traditional menu. 
All three burgers on the carnivorous menu — the All-American, Dirty Irish and Californian — have vegan counterparts on the plant-based menu. The menu features a Beyond Meat patty, a soy-free vegan burger patty that looks and (almost) tastes like real meat. The three plant-based versions also include dairy-free pepper jack and American cheese.
The Californian burger is served on a rustic bun that can only be described as the breaded version of a pillow. The taste is exactly what one would hope for from a fancy vegan burger, but at $8.75, the dish reminds customers that while the assembly of ingredients is simple, the pico de gallo emerges as a dominant flavor. 
The menu is generally affordable, deviating from the trend of expensive eateries setting up shop throughout USC Village. 
One highlight, a generous plate of fried pickles for $4.75, satiates a craving for comforting bar food but is inconsistent in taste and quality, with some bites resembling the texture of cardboard. The dish also tragically lacks a dipping sauce. 
Among the pricier options is the classic pairing of grilled cheese and tomato soup for $12.75. While the dish features simple ingredients, its flavors are perfect. The tomato soup is lightly cloaked in the flavor of sweet peppers, adeptly balancing the sharpness and bitterness of the Irish cheddar and dill pickles sandwiched between two slices of perfectly toasted, not-too-buttery bread. 
But the highlight of the limited opening menu is the vegan shepherd’s pie, which also uses a Beyond Meat product. The classic mashed potato topping is replaced by a cauliflower mash with onions, peas and carrots. While the pie is a small serving for $11.75, its flavors are spot-on and the absence of meat is hardly noticeable.
But Rock & Reilly’s is more than a restaurant. If anything, the food is secondary to the gastropub’s primary mission of serving libations to the masses. 
While Rock ‘n Reilly’s has a beer and wine list, featuring 24 different types of beer on tap, the restaurant does not yet have a cocktail menu. This puts a little bit of a dent in the expectations most patrons have for a pub as well decorated as Rock & Reilly’s, but the bar is fully stocked and boasts myriad beers on tap worth sampling.  
Described by the server as a “brunch beer,” the SLO Brewing Cali Squeeze is a blood orange-flavored Hefeweizen that tastes like a savory mimosa for $7 a glass. Another $7 standout is the Dogfish Head SeaQuench Session Sour, an extremely light beer that resembles lemonade and is accented with hints of lime.
With its hospitable environment and well-priced menu, Rock & Reilly’s is a favorable addition to USC Village’s ever-growing lineup of shops and restaurants. While the target demographic is ambiguous (the pub is 21+ after 10:30 p.m. and on gameday), the restaurant’s mix of quirk and traditionalism gives it great potential.

Comedian Ken Jeong speaks to students at Bovard Auditorium Thursday about pursuing their interests, telling the story of his decision to leave medicine in order to pursue an acting career. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
An estimated 500 guests filled Bovard Auditorium to hear “Crazy Rich Asians” actor Ken Jeong speak about his experiences as an Asian American leader in the entertainment industry Thursday. The discussion was moderated by stand-up comedian Kevin Shea. 
The event was the final celebration for Global Cultural Month, a campus-wide initiative created by the International Student Assembly meant to celebrate USC’s diverse student body and cultural backgrounds. 
“I’m just one voice,” Jeong said. “We all have different journeys and I think that the more diversity of voices that appear in sessions like these, you will relate to one of us.”
Jeong has appeared in several television shows and films, including “The Office,” “Knocked Up,” “Community” and “The Hangover” franchise. Most recently, Jeong had a role in “Crazy Rich Asians” — one of the highest grossing films in the past decade that featured an all-Asian cast. 
“‘Crazy Rich Asians’ really has helped usher, what [director] Jon Chu calls, not a movie, but a movement,” Jeong said. “I think we are living in good times. It can’t be a better time right now … to be an Asian American in entertainment because now there is a community of us.”
Jeong said that after the commercial success of “Crazy Rich Asians,” his Asian American  friends have been having their projects greenlit by Hollywood, contributing to an increase industry representation. 
Before his acting career, Jeong studied at Duke University and graduated with a medical degree from the University of North Carolina. After working as a full-time physician at Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills Medical Center, he left his job to pursue his love for comedy and performance.
“When you’re a doctor, you have a white-collar job and I moved from a white-collar to a job to even a more spoiled job,” Jeong joked. “I have no calluses on my hands whatsoever.”
Jeong attributed the switch from being a practicing physician to pursuing his passion for comedy and acting to his wife Tran Ho. 
“I literally would not have a career — if my wife didn’t let me, I wouldn’t do it,” Jeong said. “Tran was like … ‘If you don’t quit … you’re going to resent everyone around you, including me, and I won’t get in your way of success or failure …’ She was more confident in me than I was in myself.”
The actor has a stand-up comedy special coming to Netflix in 2019 after a 10-year hiatus from the stand-up stage.  
Jeong also spoke about his experience as a father of two and the lessons he hopes to impart on his twin daughters.
“We don’t encourage them in any direction,” Jeong said. “I’m encouraging them to follow their strengths and passions. I always tell my kids, ‘Don’t even think about [finances].’ If I could make $100, that’s better than making $100,000 in an area I don’t like.”
Following the discussion, student attendees were invited to ask Jeong questions. 
Michael Lau, a student majoring in business of cinematic arts, asked Jeong whether he should pursue a career in acting or go into film marketing and production and act as a hobby.
“What do you like the most out of those things? Just follow that,” Jeong said. “Some of the best producers and writers in the world started out as actors.”
To close the event, Jeong offered students some parting advice about pursuing their dreams. 
“Follow your passion … you have the golden opportunity to find something that you love to do,” Jeong said. “It could be something that you loved in grade school, and you’re reinforcing that here at USC. It could be something brand new. You’ll never get this opportunity to have this full landscape of ideas … Even if you ultimately don’t go on that path, you will never regret it.”

Queer and Ally Student Assembly co-Director Varsha Sivaram speaks at the Solidarity Rally in September. Sivaram said the annual OUTlist is a way to commemorate Coming Out Month. (Emily Smith)
Early next week, the Queer and Ally Student Assembly will publish its annual OUTlist, a collection of University-affiliated names and organizations intended to show support for the queer community on campus. 
The list received 672 signatures this year throughout the month of October, including student organizations Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Undergraduate Student Government, El Centro Chicano and Daily Trojan.
“The OUTlist is a platform where transfers, students, faculty and staff can show their support and solidarity toward students of the queer community,” Undergraduate Student Government co-Chief Diversity Officer Milton Dimas said. 
The OUTlist, according to the LGBT Resource Center website, is inspired by a 1990 publication of 50 signatures from students who pledged to end homophobia and accept all people on campus. Since then, the OUTlist has only grown and gained support at USC.
“We do it in commemoration of Coming Out Month because it’s a sensitive time for a lot of queer folks,” QuASA co-Director Varsha Sivaram said. 
Sivaram said an informal version of the OUTlist — a whiteboard people were encouraged to sign — was put up at QuASA events this year to help spread awareness for the actual online document. 
Another addition to the OUTlist, according to Sivaram, was a quote section where people could state why they had signed the document.
One particular quote that stood out to her expressed that support is fundamental to queer individuals who are still coming out. 
“It’s the notion [that] if I had had someone who was publicly supportive of the queer community or was secure in their queerness who came out and said it was okay for me when I was coming out, that would have been enormously helpful,” Sivaram said. 
The OUTlist demonstrates USC’s commitment to supporting the queer community on campus, Dimas said. 
“It’s important to continue to [have the OUTlist] because students who identify as queer should feel welcomed, considering the fact that we [are a] Trojan Family,” Dimas said. 
Erin Cooney, co-director of QuASA, said that it is crucial to give allies a chance to declare their support and the LGBTQ community an opportunity to see its supporters. 
Sivaram emphasized that the OUTlist provides LGBTQ members with the reassurance that they are not alone without pressuring them to come out.
“I think it’s a tangible show of support for folks,” Sivaram said. “It cultivates the notion that there’s a supportive environment for them at USC.” 
Chris Bradley, a senior majoring in business administration and accounting, signed to OUTlist. He said the list allows queer individuals a chance to be comfortable with their identities, regardless of whether they are out or not. 
“The biggest thing for me was to break the stereotype and to have people be open with themselves,” Bradley said. “There’s still a couple kids at USC who haven’t come out, which is surprising considering this is a relatively friendly campus. It goes to show that even in 2018 there’s a lot of work to be done.” 
Bradley said the OUTlist provides a source of pride for queer students. 
“It’s a mark of progress we’ve made,” Bradley said. “[The OUTlist] goes to show how confident [we are] and how far we’ve come. I feel very strongly that we are not going to go back.” 
Further plans to expand the OUTlist include coordinating an event geared toward garnering more signatures. 
“Our mission during Coming Out Month … is giving people safe spaces in order to express themselves,” Cooney said. “Even within the queer community people have such different identities and experiences that it is significant to give people a place or opportunity to have those conversations.”

Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry sent a memo to the USC community Thursday about nonconsensual drugging at campus parties.
Carry said that during office hours in October, a student informed him of what she viewed as a regularity of nonconsensual drugging. 
“She explained that among her friends, everyone had a story about someone believing they have been drugged,” Carry wrote in the memo. 
According to Carry’s statement, the student said that getting drugged at parties around campus has become normalized.
Carry also addressed the criminality of nonconsensual drugging. 
“Students and organizations that are found responsible for ‘spiking drinks’ will be punished to the fullest extent of the law and face disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from the University,” Carry wrote. “I strongly urge students who have information … to share it with the Department of Public Safety or the Office of Professionalism and Ethics.”
Carry offered students tips on how to reduce the possibility of getting drugged. He said students should not leave their drink unattended and should open their own beverage. They should also be observant by stopping if their drink  tastes off. If a student is believed to be drugged, they should seek medical attention immediately. 
The memo ended with a list of resources. Carry said that reporting these incidents is fundamental to preventing them. 
“Nonconsensual drugging is a crime and a serious violation of our community standards,” Carry wrote. “Everyone’s help is required to rid our community of this behavior.”

Provost Michael Quick sent a letter to USC faculty on Thursday regarding a new initiative to foster diversity at the University. 
Quick wrote that $50 million will be allocated to promote diversity, equity and inclusion on campus by hiring new faculty. 
“Funds will also be used to grow our pipeline programs that support postdoctoral fellows and their transition to USC faculty members,” Quick wrote in the letter.
Funds will be gathered through an effort among the Office for Academic Affairs and all USC schools, which will request dollar-to-dollar matching on funds they raise for the initiative. 
The new initiative will also establish a Center for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion, which is expected to serve as a focal point to recruit and retain diverse faculty, along with developing and sustaining campus initiatives, the memo stated. 
The center’s specific mission is not yet defined; however, it hopes to serve as a primary entity to oversee and coordinate campus diversity. 
“[It will] provide professional development training and support for faculty, hiring managers, search committees, and new leaders,” Quick wrote.
The letter also listed past resources and initiatives for fostering diversity on campus led by faculty and staff, such as the USC Race and Equity Center and the Provost’s Diversity and Inclusion Council.

The No. 2 women’s soccer team will face off No. 6 UCLA  Friday night at the StubHub Center, bringing a close to the regular Pac-12 season. After a win against No. 20 Colorado and a shutout tie against Utah, the Trojans are now 15-1-2 overall and 8-1-1 in conference play. USC will take a seven-game undefeated streak into the matchup. 
The 13-3-1 Bruins are coming off eight consecutive victories, the most recent being against Colorado. Sophomore attacker Ashley Sanchez played an integral role in both of the Bruins’ goals. After a Colorado foul early in the 19th minute, Sanchez launched a free kick to the left side, which helped create a scoring opportunity for redshirt junior midfielder Chloe Castaneda. The Bruins kept Colorado at bay, holding it to zero shots on goal and a 1-0 lead at the close of the half. 
Colorado came out strong in the second half, creating multiple scoring opportunities with a shot that hit the post in the 63rd minute and a narrowly missed free kick in the 64th. Buffs attacker Taylor Kornieck nailed a cross in front of the left post, scoring the tying goal and bringing the score to 1-1.
In the 77th minute, UCLA’s Sanchez scored the game-winner when she stole the ball from a Colorado and launched it from close range past the Buffs keeper.
 Sanchez will be the main offensive player on the Trojans’ radar heading into the game on Friday. 
She leads the Bruins in all scoring categories with 23 points, 8 goals and seven assists. Sanchez has also either scored a goal or provided an assist in each of UCLA’s last eight games. 
The Trojans currently have a 398-minute streak going of keeping opponents scoreless, but the defense will need to be on high alert for the Bruins’ aggressive offensive plays. Sunday’s win also marked the fourth time in USC history that the team has marked 13 clean sheets in a season.  
On the offensive end, the Trojans have outscored their opponents 46-7. Their goal differential of 39 leads the Pac-12 conference. 
Having outshot opponents 354-144 this year, the Trojans will need to continue working hard to control possession from the beginning in order to create scoring opportunities against the Bruins, whose goalies tail right behind redshirt sophomore Trojan keeper Kaylie Collins with a combined 41 saves. 
Four of the last five wins in a USC-UCLA matchup have gone to the Bruins, including the last two in a row. The last time the two teams faced off, the Bruins took the Trojans into overtime, with Sanchez scoring the winning goal in the 91st minute. The Trojans ended up tying the Bruins for a second-place finish in the Pac-12. UCLA leads the Crosstown Showdown series against USC with an all-time record of 24-6-1. 
The Trojans are tied at the top of the Pac-12 standings this season with No. 1 Stanford at 25 points each, while the Bruins follow close in second with 24 points. 
In addition to playing for a chance at the Pac-12 Conference title, both UCLA and USC head into the game vying for favorable seeding in the NCAA tournament. 
The Trojans are ahead of the Bruins coming in at second place on the most recent United Soccer Coaches NCAA Division I Women’s national poll with 828 total points and two first place votes, compared to the Bruins’ 679 points and sixth place ranking.  
The Trojans will host the Bruins in the crosstown showdown at StubHub Center Friday at 7 p.m.

Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman leads the team with 561 reception yards and six touchdowns. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
The Trojans will enter Corvallis, Oregon this weekend at .500 on the season with their home win streak broken by a loss to Arizona State  at the Coliseum on Saturday. The loss triggered major coaching changes as head coach Clay Helton announced Monday that he would be taking over play-calling duties from offensive coordinator Tee Martin and that Tim Drevno would replace Neil Calloway as offensive line coach. 
“When you get into November obviously as a play-caller, it’s always a bit different, but we have a system and you can’t just revamp a system in a week,” Helton said. “You do the things that you think your kids can operate with, and there may be a wrinkle or two. We did things in that game last week that we want to be able to build off.”
It remains to be seen exactly what the on-field changes will look like, but the matchup with the last team in the Pac-12 in Oregon State (2-6) should provide strong competition for the Trojans to figure out where they want to go. Oregon State has struggled mightily throughout the year, though a 21-point comeback and overtime win against Colorado on Saturday certainly gave it some momentum heading into the contest. 
“[The older guys] came to me and said, ‘Look coach, I know this has been our routine for a long time, but we’d really like to have a sense of urgency and keep the pads on and keep on grinding,’” Helton said. “So we did.”
USC offense vs. Oregon State defense
The Trojan offense performed well down the stretch last week as redshirt freshman quarterback Jack Sears heated up in his first start, putting up 235 yards and two touchdowns while completing over 70 percent of his passes. On top of that, the run game produced 149 yards. 
Though Sears was impressive in his first college football game, freshman quarterback JT Daniels will once again take the reins of the Trojan offense as he returns from a concussion he sustained against Utah. He will be eased back into things this week against a Beavers defense that allows 45.6 points per game — the third most in the FBS. 
The recent play of junior receiver Michael Pittman should help make Daniels’ job easier. Over the last three weeks, Pittman had 16 catches, 352 yards and five touchdowns. Expect the pair to tear up an Oregon State defense that’s allowed 273 passing yards per game. 
“Pittman’s success has been from building,” Helton said. “It doesn’t matter if he’s special teams or offense, he’s a difference maker player. [Pittman] only knows one speed, and he plays in that one speed. He’s doing a phenomenal job and becoming a pro.”
The team’s run game has been spotty throughout the year, largely due to inconsistent run blocking by the offensive line. Under Drevno’s leadership, the unit should look much better starting this weekend against a soft Beaver defensive front. Look for a big game on the ground from the Trojan backs.
Oregon State offense vs. USC defense
Oregon State’s offense is a much more competent unit than the one it has on the other side of the ball. For the Beavers, everything begins with freshman running back Jemar Jefferson. 
Jefferson has had a monster first year, with 1,034 yards on the year already on a clip of 6.4 yards per carry along with 12 touchdowns. Jefferson is a shifty runner who’s hard to get a hold of; this could be a problem for a USC defense that’s had major issues containing similar backs the past two weeks in Arizona State’s Eno Benjamin and Utah’s Zach Moss. 
The Beavers’ passing offense has played three different quarterbacks through the season, with largely mixed results. Senior Jake Luton, who took over from sophomore Jack Colletto at halftime last week and brought the team back from a 28-point deficit, seems poised to start under center for Oregon State this week. Luton has been efficient in his limited action on the year, with a two-thirds completion rate and four touchdowns to only one interception. 
Luton has capable weapons to work with in receivers sophomore Isaiah Hodgins and senior Timmy Hernandez, who have 990 receiving yards between them on the year. 
Though the Trojan defense has struggled in recent weeks, it should be able to put up a solid stand. Senior inside linebacker Cameron Smith’s return should be huge for the Trojans; his presence will alleviate a lot of the unit’s tackling woes. 
The loss of freshman safety Talanoa Hufanga due to injury will hurt, but senior Marvell Tell’s return will provide support on the back end. 
“[November] separates the men from the boys,” Helton said. “No time to be tired. The season is a grind.” 
Prediction: USC 35, OSU 21
The Trojans have proven their instability in recent weeks. Any unit on the team has the potential to stop functioning at any time. However, Oregon State should offer the perfect opportunity for a revamped coaching staff to find its footing and start straightening things out for the Trojans. Expect Oregon State to make some plays and for the Trojans to make their fair share of mistakes before pulling away comfortably.

Considering the hot mess that is the USC football program, Trojan fans are forgetting to pay attention to arguably the most important fall sport: the women’s soccer team who will take on UCLA Friday at StubHub Center. 
Before I make my case for why fans should invest their weekends in the soccer team, I will acknowledge that USC is a football school and that a significant amount of Trojan fans will not care about any sport that isn’t played on the gridiron. But I urge those people to watch just one women’s soccer game, particularly Friday’s game.
Last year, I covered the women’s soccer beat for the Daily Trojan. Going into the season, I had never watched a collegiate soccer match, and I probably wouldn’t have if I didn’t cover the team. Like most Americans, soccer was never a big part of my life; I played for a couple years when I was little and I watch the World Cup and the Olympics, but aside from that, I didn’t really pay attention to soccer. I never appreciated the sport like I did baseball or hockey, but USC women’s soccer changed that for me. 
The sheer excitement this team brings to the table is enough to make the most casual viewer sit on the edge of their seat. The games are 90 minutes of fast-paced, action-packed competition. 
Moreover, the individual players on this team are fun. The women on the soccer team may be the most human athletes I’ve come across. Before games, they laugh and dance on the field; and between games, they tear up social media hyping each other up. You can’t teach enthusiasm, charisma or camaraderie, but you can leave room for it to grow naturally. 
If you’re frustrated with the coaching situation on the football team, I urge you to find relief with the soccer team. Head coach Keidane McAlpine is one of the best collegiate soccer coaches in the nation. He was able to turn a struggling USC team around with the snap of his fingers. In the last two seasons the Women of Troy have finished with .800 winning percentages and are on track to surpass that mark this year — they sit at .889 with one game remaining. 
Friday’s game against UCLA means the world to USC. The matchup is the final game for both teams’ regular season campaigns. When the two teams met at Drake Stadium last year, they duked it out in front of a record-breaking crowd of 11,925 people. Fans were treated to free soccer when the Los Angeles foes couldn’t settle the game in regulation. USC fell short in the golden goal overtime just minutes before it would have ended in a draw, but the loss took its toll on the Trojans.
Following the UCLA game, the Women of Troy entered the 64-team tournament as the third seed in their division. The team didn’t look as peppy as it had looked for the majority of the season. In retrospect, USC lost its momentum as a result of closing the season with back-to-back losses to Stanford and UCLA. 
From a record standpoint, this game means almost nothing. USC has a bid to the tournament and a loss to UCLA will not change that. But from a mentality, momentum and pride standpoint, this game means everything for the Trojans to close out their season.
If all of that didn’t convince you to watch the game, consider the fact that the game will be played at StubHub Center in Carson, Calif. It seems like a massive venue for a collegiate soccer game, but I guarantee the stadium will not look as empty as the USC-ASU football game last weekend at the Coliseum.
If you are a USC fan frustrated with the abysmal performance of head coach Clay Helton and co., spend your Friday night at StubHub Center watching two soccer powerhouses go head-to-head in a game that should be nothing less than a thriller.

A rather poorly titled event took place on campus this week: “Virgin Voters: The 2018 Midterm Elections.” The event carries a message that, thankfully, has ingrained itself more fully in contemporary politics than the phrase “virgin voters” has. 
The event’s main elements are incredibly indicative of the current political moment — it’s hosted by USC’s voter registration initiative and streamed on Facebook Live. The existence of this event, and the dozens of events like it, sends a clear message: The youth vote is incredibly important, and dozens of groups are working to sway it in one direction or another.
To be a college student in America is to belong to one of the most valued target audiences in the nation: old enough to vote, young enough to do so morally. As a constituency, college students are more politically disparate than many groups. 
As political advertisements increasingly rely on social media to reach young voters — especially the virgins among us — young people must demand more from the platforms broadcasting these messages. With Nov. 6 fast approaching, college students’ discerning consumption of media, that is perhaps more valuable than ever. 
Viral online videos focusing on personal narrative are replacing conventional forms of political communication, allowing a new wave of unconventional candidates the opportunity to directly and immediately engage with young people. 
Such videos can be seen as a solution, or at least a response, to a political advertising system often unwelcoming to outsider voices that may appeal to a youth vote. 
As such, strategists cite the success of candidates such as Massachusetts congressional candidate Ayanna Pressley, New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and  Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams with optimism. 
For young progressives within the Democratic Party, the rise of these voices is especially rousing. Some pundits have called these candidates and their low-cost videos a solution to a Democratic Party that is seen as increasingly out of touch. 
But therein lies a chunk of the problem. If a solution relies on a flawed foundation, its own effectiveness stands to be contested as well. This may become the case with our new approach to campaign communication. 
That viral videos have opened the once-locked realm of political advertising for new candidates is an objective benefit. That this had to happen largely on social media, a platform that stands on increasingly shaky ground with regards to partisan — let alone truthful — political messaging, is unfair. 
Historians will have a fun time untangling the current state of society and politics. As social media becomes more and more synonymous with the core of American youth culture, security breaches, notably at Facebook, have surged. These events are not necessarily causal, or even correlated, but their impacts — many of which could very well be felt this midterm cycle — will certainly link. 
It is unsurprising that candidates with more diverse life experiences — many of whom excited young voters with their debut — have had to engage most heavily with the very platforms accused of threatening democracy, thus placing an uneven burden on outsider candidates. 
We can be critical of platforms like Facebook and their impacts on elections, while supporting a candidate who uses it cleverly. However, it’s a decision calculus — and there’s no clear formula. One can only hope that somehow the medium, given the limited options, might not really be the message. It is, after all, unlikely. 
Still, there is no reason to cling to bygone modes of political communication. Former president Barack Obama’s famous 2008 infomercial would be but a blip in a now-relentless news cycle. 
Similarly, Obama’s huge ad spending back in 2008 would be entirely inaccessible to candidates in 2018. A decade has passed and even in forced dependency to troubling platforms, there could be some change the young people of America can finally believe in.

Improving access to housing is key to ameliorating California’s housing and homelessness crisis.
With about a third of homeless people suffering from mental illness, Proposition 2, also known as the No Place Like Home Act, is a crucial step in the right direction. Come Election Day, vote yes on this ballot measure.
Prop 2 will authorize $2 billion in bonds from the Mental Health Services Act to pay for the construction of supportive housing for homeless people suffering from severe mental illness.
Voters approved The Mental Health Services Act in 2004 under Prop 63. The Act expanded mental health programs by increasing the income tax paid by people whose incomes exceeded $1 million by 1 percent.
Although the act was designed to expand mental health programs, it never explicitly mentioned housing. Therefore, when legislation passed pursuant to the No Place Like Home Act of 2016 authorizing use of revenue from the the Mental Health Services Act to issue bonds for supportive housing, no bonds were issued due to questions about the scope of Prop 63. The housing program has been stuck in the courts since.
Prop 2 is on the California ballot this year to cut through this red tape. Voting yes on the proposition will approve the No Place Like Home Act of 2016 and approve the allocation of $2 billion in revenue bonds to support the program, providing thousands of mentally ill homeless people with housing and treatment.
According to CNBC, there are over 134,000 homeless people in California, and about a third of them have untreated mental health issues. There are nearly 53,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County alone and providing housing for mentally ill homeless people is imperative during the current housing crisis.
Treatment for mental health and addiction is nearly impossible when people have to return to the trauma of homelessness. According to Jeff Kositsky, who oversees San Francisco’s homelessness efforts, people with mental health conditions cannot get better living on the streets.
Decades of research show that the combination of stable housing and mental health services promotes health and stability. Programs that provide stable housing are far more effective, and Prop 2 would ensure California cities and counties will be able to implement them.
Permanent supportive housing guarantees access not only to mental health and substance abuse services, but also to medical care, case managers, job training, education and more. If passed, Prop 2 would lead to the construction of 20,000 of these permanent supportive housing units under the No Place Like Home program, providing coordinated care to those who need it.
While some think Prop 2 will steal money from treatment programs, this is highly unlikely as the cost is only a small part of the Mental Health Services Act and will decrease with time. The bonds will temporarily use about 6 percent of the revenue created by the act. This small cost would not strip the programs created by the Mental Health Services Act, but would effectively use the funding by increasing the success of treatment.
Prop 2’s housing initiative coincides with the goal of the Mental Health Services Act that voters approved 14 years ago: to fund mental health services.
According to Darrell Steinberg, the author of the Mental Health Services Act, “Mental illness does not have to be a life sentence of despair and dysfunction. Supportive housing provides the stability people need as they recover from untreated serious mental illness. It helps them stay off the street and live with dignity.”
On Tuesday, be sure to vote yes to Prop 2. California cannot postpone permanent supportive housing for mentally ill homeless people any longer. Prop 2 is paramount to helping California’s mentally ill homeless population receive housing and treatment, and it needs voters’ support to be put into action.
