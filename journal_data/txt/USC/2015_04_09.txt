With warmer weather ahead it seems that festivals and events have too moved out doors. Spring is certainly a season to appreciate the nature around us, but it’s also one to appreciate great art. There are the more popular arts festivals like Coachella, but if you weren’t lucky enough to score tickets or it simply isn’t in your price range, plenty of arts events will be held on campus and in the city beyond. Here’s a quick roundup of a few of those, which will hopefully be enriching and enjoyable without maxing out your budget.
Trojan Film Festival – Apr. 9 // Ray Stark Theatre// 7 p.m.
USC’s first ever Trojan Film Festival will take place on campus at the Ray Stark Theatre tonight. Cosponsored by the School of Cinematic Arts, the festival will screen 13 films across a variety of genres, including dramas, documentaries, comedies and stop motion specials. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and refreshments will be provided.
April Art Walk  – Apr. 9 // Downtown Los Angeles Art Walk Lounge // 6 p.m.
The Downtown Art Walk takes place every second Thursday of the month, bringing together more than 10,000 artists, art collectors and art enthusiasts. This month, the event will focus on the world of small-scale, independent publishing, and hopes to bring more attention to the alternative literary scene consisting of comics and zines. Among tonight’s special guests will be Morley, an LA based artist who specializes in wheatpaste typographic posters, Gavin Hignight, the creator and writer of the graphic novel Motor City, web comic The Concrete World and Fanboy Comics, a digital geek media site that focuses on pop culture. Though this month’s theme centers around zines and comics, there will also be a slough of other exhibits on display, including a show by Ellen Cantor that will examine the role of memory in preserving the past.
FemFest – Apr. 10 // E.F. Hutton Park // 6 p.m.
Hosted by the Women’s Student Assembly, FemFest will bring music and spoken word artists to campus, while bringing issues concerning marginalization and sexism to light. In its third year, FemFest will continue to blend politics and art to celebrate girl power and community. The event will have a variety of art stations, including booths dedicated to wire art, linoleum printing and painting. Currently, FemFest has been working on collecting art submissions for a community art project, which will be displayed to the public.
Los Angeles Festival of Books – Apr. 18 -19 // USC // Saturday: 10 a.m.-6 p.m., Sunday: 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Since 1996, the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books has maintained its goal of bringing together people who love books with people who create them. The festival has grown to include live music, poetry readings, chef demos, cultural entertainment and artists who produce and display their work on site. For photography and film aficionados there will also be film screenings and a photography exhibit, followed by Q&A sessions and discussion panels. In previous years, the festival has attracted approximately 150,000 people who come to view exhibits by booksellers, publishers, museums, theatres and literary/cultural organizations. Attendees can buy books and other merchandise at the festival and purchase Conversation tickets for an additional price online.
Brewery Artwalk and Open Studios – Apr. 25 -26 // Brewery Art Los Angeles // 11 a.m.
Located northeast of Downtown, this annual free event displays Los Angeles art that is on the cutting edge. Resident artists of The Brewery work across genres from photography to LED light sculpture and hail from backgrounds as diverse as the art they produce. The artwalk will place a special emphasis on exploring the intersections between science technology and the arts, and will also be offering works for sale. As L.A. arts events usually go, there will be food trucks and a beer garden as well!
College Night at the Getty Center – Apr. 27 // Getty Center // 6 p.m.
College students enjoy free food, parking, art, and entertainment on the 27th! Students will have access to special gallery tours and meet-the-curator sessions, while enjoying live music by UCLA-based band Eva B. Ross Foundation. This year’s College Night will feature two special exhibitions. The first is Painting Set Free, a collection of J.M.W. Turner’s paintings and watercolors, which were all painted during the last fifteen years of his life. On the other hand, Light, Paper, Process: Reinventing Photography will feature the work of seven photographers who have focused on reducing the process of picture-making to its most essential form. Another exhibition that will be on view is Zeitgeist: Art in the Germanic World 1800-1900. The show features the works of Caspar David Friedrich, Philipp Otto Runge, Gustav Klimt and others.

The Marshall Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab hosted a “Lunch & Learn” event at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Thursday afternoon. The featured speaker was Alex Dorsey, general manager of pop-up produce market eroots, who talked about her experience with the business and the knowledge she has gained from working there.
The eroots program provides organic fruits and vegetables to consumers with modest means. The social enterprise sells its packed boxes at schools and businesses so the food can be conveniently picked up during a busy schedule.
Dorsey said social enterprises differ from other businesses because they directly affect people through positive change.
“The one thing that social enterprise does that is very different than business as a whole is the commitment to make a difference — some social impact,” Dorsey said. “I encourage you to really think about that as you plan … what you’re going to do after graduating.”
Enoch Kim, student intern for the Social Enterprise Lab, said he believes businesses shouldn’t solely focus on money.
“We need to focus on our future,” Kim said. “The social capital of moving forward in generations to come will be very much impacted by your efforts today. As business students, you cannot be always profit-minded; you have to take into consideration the social well-being of the community around you.”
According to Dorsey, a structured system is very important when trying to create positive change with others. Dorsey said eroots reached out to communities for the answers it needed.
“Policy is fundamental in anything that has to do with food … and the environment,” Dorsey said. “We created a leadership program that would educate residents on defining for themselves what a healthy community is and what’s needed to ensure access to healthy food within the community you advocate for yourself, especially when you’re in survival mode and you have to work a couple jobs.”
Even after setting up a successful infrastructure, Dorsey said businesses have to be prepared for the worst and ready to respond.
“You have to be able to pivot,” Dorsey said. “You can do all the planning and have the focus groups and have a great business plan, but when you get on the ground, challenges will arise and you have to be nimble in your thinking. What happens when your lead farm goes out of business because of the drought and they didn’t have enough capital to sustain them and all of the sudden the food that you committed to every single week doesn’t have a source?”
In addition, Dorsey said social enterprises need reliable backup for a bad situation.
“Numerous challenges come up that you can’t even begin to imagine,” Dorsey said. “In your thinking about social enterprise, you got to have the resources both in terms of cash and people within your network to help you think creatively, so you can continue to grow and serve.”
Roshan Jayanti, a junior majoring in global health, said he was glad Dorsey talked about both the good and bad experiences one might encounter  in developing a social enterprise.
“There’s a certain ambition involved in social enterprise…but I think there is also a stark reality and kind of a harshness of this situation of… funding and financing, and the discrepancy between how much it costs to do one of these projects and how feasible it is, and I think Alex balanced [those two topics] very well,” Jayanti said. “My interest lies more in health, where, unfortunately, the prices are even more expensive and the discrepancies are even larger, but kind of seeing the creativity she used…[is] illuminating, as a lot of the students in this room go into social enterprise positions.”
The “Lunch & Learn” event was the last of the series for the spring, but the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab said it will continue to host events next semester.

Javan Shah, a senior majoring in business administration, launched Dinobo, an application connecting students for summer storage solutions on March 26.
Shah described the startup service as an inexpensive and convenient way for students to store their belongings close to campus during the summer months. The platform connects students who stay at USC over the summer with those who want to leave their belongings near campus. The main advantage of this service is that it is much cheaper than the traditional storage companies students usually use.
Shah spoke about how the initial idea stemmed from his own personal experiences finding storage space during the summer.
“When I was a freshman, I saw this need for places to store goods because I had that need myself, and because some people stay here during the summer, I just thought how great it would be if we could just match those people up,” Shah said.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Shah described the benefits of Dinobo compared to other storage services and facilities.
“It provides convenient storage locations because you can find space wherever people are living,” Shah said. “If you’re a freshman living in Gateway, you can just find space in a Gateway apartment, which saves you a lot of hassle involved with moving goods.”
For enhanced security and safety, only students with a USC email address can sign up for the service.
After creating the application, Shah used social media and physical flyers to market the service to students around campus.
“For marketing, it is a little difficult to reach all students, partly because there’s so many of us. But once they find out what the website is, the response is usually overwhelmingly positive,” Shah said.
Shah spoke about how his personal background and education contributed to the conception and creation of his business.
“I took a gap semester and learned some programming, though I ultimately ended up outsourcing other programmers to design it,” Shah said. “I definitely want to be an entrepreneur, though, and work at my own startup, and depending on how it goes, this might be the one.”
Shah also discussed how his experiences as a USC Marshall business student prepared him to launch his own startup company.
“Marshall gave me exposure to creative students who like technology and entrepreneurship. You get more ideas and improve your thinking when you discuss and brainstorm with people who have similar interests, but may have different viewpoints and opinions,” Shah said.
Though the initial stages of introducing the service will be focused on the USC campus, Shah also touched upon the possibility of bringing it to other universities.
“It’s a model that can be expanded to other universities because I think a lot of people can use this solution,” Shah said. “Right now we’re focused on growing it at USC as much as possible over the next few weeks, and we’ll see where it goes.”

USG President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler held the first Senate meeting of their term this week after officially taking office on March 31. Before Sampath and Fowler won the Undergraduate Student Government presidential and vice presidential elections for the 2015-2016 school year, no women in the entire Pac-12 had ever occupied the top two positions of student government.
Demographics remain disproportionately dominated by males in places like Congress and top CEO positions, and student government is one of many leadership areas in which women are still largely underrepresented.
“It’s definitely a cultural problem,” Sampath said. “I was shocked when I found out it’s been 10 years since a woman even tried to run at USC.”
Yet their motivations behind running together were matters of qualification and overlapping interests, not gender.
“When Rini approached me to run, we didn’t do this to create history,” Fowler said. “We just did it because we thought we were the most qualified.”
For Sampath and Fowler, being the first-ever female USG team is a call to action rather than a celebration of defying the odds.
“We shouldn’t let history or the precedent stop people, women in particular, from feeling like they’re qualified for these positions that mostly men have occupied in the past,” Fowler said.
Sampath said that the sexist and racist comments on Yik Yak, an anonymous bulletin board application, directed at her during their campaign was a wake-up call.
“I anticipated there would be a push back, but I didn’t quite get how extreme it would get,” Sampath said. “We had one of our campaign members told that he should consider switching teams because the likelihood of two women winning was slim. That was really disappointing to me that that’s coming from a Trojan in our family.”
Similarly, Fowler said that she was surprised to discover that hostility toward women in leadership roles remains a prevalent issue on campus.
“It was kind of shocking to come to USC and hear this was something that needed to be talked about,” Fowler said. “It’s incredibly sad that this is still the case and the only way we can break the stereotype is getting women involved.”
Sampath urged women and other marginalized groups to defy the notion that they do not belong in leadership roles.
“We have to run for these positions. We have to try,” Sampath said. “The more people run, the more it’s going to get normalized. Right now when those comments are made they’re actually valid to some people, and they’re valid because we don’t see women in office.”
Sampath and Fowler agreed that women show much promise in working productively together in high-level, high responsibility positions.
“As women we can sometimes get catty and try to tear each other down, but we have it in our power to empower each other,” Sampath said. “Women have a really unique way in which they can help each other out.”
Fowler believes that women can collectively overcome the prejudices against them for their gender through mutual understanding.
“If anything, having women in leadership roles is something we can connect through because we understand people may doubt us people may question us for our gender,” Fowler said.
Fowler also added that their six-person executive team has five women, further expanding female representation in student government for the upcoming school year.
“When Rini and I were picking our team, we didn’t even realize it we only have one guy and at first that was kind of shocking,” Fowler said. “But if the roles were reversed, that wouldn’t be shocking at all. The important thing was putting gender aside and really just looking at the qualifications of these people.”
Sampath and Fowler both stressed the importance of reaching out to marginalized members of the student body and encouraging them to fill the leadership positions where their presence is lacking.
“Rini has this notion of ‘passing the mic,’” Fowler said. “If we act as a liaison and make sure their voices are heard we can empower them and help with this problem.”
Ultimately, though, the initiative can only take off through each individual’s self-motivation.
“People from marginalized communities need to step up and start running,” Sampath said. “When I ran for Vice President I knew I could either wait for someone else or I could do it myself.”
Fowler said she was encouraged by a recent message from two girls running for student government at Syracuse University.
“It definitely was something exciting to see and I’m glad it’s spreading,” Fowler said. “I went to an all-girls high school and did pageants and they were all about women’s empowerment. Those experiences let me know I shouldn’t let my gender hold me back from achieving whatever it is I wanted.”
Sampath said that she hopes this historic election will mark the beginning of a trend towards equal representation in student government.
“I don’t want it to take another 10 years for the L.A. Times to say another woman is running for office,” Sampath said. “That’s why I’ve been so vocal about women representation. It’s something we need to change through the way in which we empower women to run for these types of positions.”
This story is the second of a two-part series on women in leadership positions at USC. The first installment ran on Thursday, April 9.

This Saturday, the No. 10 USC women’s rowing team will face off against crosstown rival UCLA at Ballona Creek in Marina del Rey. USC has snuck into the top 10, while UCLA is ranked just slightly lower at    No. 14.
The annual head-to-head competition has been held for the past 13 years, and the Women of Troy have defeated the Bruins in each of those years.
There are three major changes to this year’s format, though. First, the race will be held in the afternoon instead of in the morning.
The second change is that each team will add an additional varsity eight boat to the two eight-man boats and the one four-person team that usually compete.
The third and final change is to the race course. This year, the race will run from the west end of Ballona Creek to the east end, as opposed to the reverse in years past.
The scoring system will remain the same, however.
A win in the varsity eight is worth three points, with the second-place varsity eight boat earning two points.
One point each is given for the third-place varsity eight boat and the winner of the varsity four race. The first team to gain four of the seven possible points is declared the winner.
Last year, USC won the meet by a score of 4-3. The Women of Troy captured the four points with wins in the varsity eight and varsity four. The Bruins’ points came off wins in the second varsity eight and the novice eight boats.
The first race of the afternoon will be the varsity four, which begins at 4:50 p.m.
The second varsity eight will begin at 5:05 p.m., and will be followed by the varsity eight at 5:20 p.m. Fifteen minutes later, the third varsity eight race will commence.
The Women of Troy are coming off a dominating performance at the prestigious Jessop-Whittier Cup at the San Diego Crew Classic. The victory was USC’s fifth consecutive at the cup.
In San Diego, USC’s varsity eight boat defeated UCLA’s varsity eight boat, among others, in the competition.
The Women of Troy opened  the season on a high note after sweeping their races at the Head of the Oklahoma meet in early October.
Later that month, USC had boats take first place in the Head of the American meet in Northern California.

The Trojans will wrap up their 2015 spring practices this Saturday with the annual spring game. Spring practices have been quite a success for the Trojans, as multiple players have stepped up in place of those who have darted for the NFL. There will be  a multitude of things to keep a lookout for when the Trojans take the field tomorrow.
The Offense
Everybody knows what senior quarterback Cody Kessler can do. Last season he completed more than 65 percent of his passes while throwing 39 touchdowns and just five interceptions. A major focus this spring has been to determine who will replace last year’s No. 1 wide receiver Nelson Agholor. Sophomore JuJu Smith carried over his play from last season into the spring and is looking to become one of Kessler’s top targets. More surprising has been the stellar play of redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell. After redshirting his first year because of a knee injury and playing a minor role last season, Mitchell has really come into his own this spring, developing into one of Kessler’s favorite targets. The biggest mystery is sophomore Adoree’ Jackson, who might be the best cornerback the Trojans have had in years but also wants to play offense.
Meanwhile, junior Justin Davis figures to be the lead tailback for the Trojans this season although he has struggled with turnovers in his first two years. Redshirt senior Tre Madden, who should be 100 percent by the season’s start, could take some touches away from Davis. The Trojans also have two highly touted freshman running backs in Aca’Cedric Ware and Ronald Jones II, who enrolled in the spring and should factor into the equation.
The biggest position up for grabs is tight end. Redshirt sophomore Connor Spears has played well during the spring, overcoming some weight issues that coaches were concerned with. Sophomore Bryce Dixon would be the Trojans starter if he fixed his off-the-field issues. For now, the Trojans will rely on Spears with freshman Tyler Petite set to join the team in the fall.
Last season, the Trojans started three freshmen on the offensive line and gave up 32 sacks. Kessler admits that the sacks weren’t all on the offensive line, and he figures that the line will only grow this season. Though Kessler won’t be getting sacked on Saturday, keep an eye out for how the offensive line protects him. Giving up a lot of “air” sacks is not going to keep head coach Steve Sarkisian happy.
The defense
The Trojans might have lost their best defensive player from last season in NFL-bound defensive lineman Leonard Williams, but defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox returns seven starters from 2014 on his side of the ball.
This group includes an array of talent, in junior Su’a Cravens, who will look to make an impact as a hybrid safety and linebacker, sophomore cornerback and wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson, redshirt seniors Atwaun Woods and Delvon Simmons and redshirt senior linebacker Anthony Sarao.
“If Su’a Cravens isn’t a First Team All-American and Pac-12 Player of the Year on defense, I’d be shocked,” Sarkisian said.
The secondary will also have a great deal of experience, as senior cornerback Kevon Seymour and a pair of starting safeties in junior Leon McQuay III and sophomore John Plattenburg are all returning for the Trojans.
Wilcox’s defense, which uses multiple fronts but runs out of a 3-4 set, has a lot to build on from last season after recording its highest total yards average in its                     history (407.9).
There are positives to take away from last season as well, though, with the Trojans not allowing any of its opponents to score on their game-opening drive. They also ranked in the nation’s top 20 in turnover margin, in addition to red zone and third down conversion defense.
At Thursday’s practice, Wilcox said that his defense has been mentally quicker and sees things clearer this spring, which should be a good sign for the progression of his unit.
Saturday’s game is set to kick off at 3 p.m.

No. 6 USC will attempt to brush off a disappointing loss to No. 13 UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday as it hosts No. 9 UCLA in a crosstown rival showdown.
The Trojans will enter this weekend’s match after falling 2-1 to UCSB in a game characterized by well-hit balls falling the wrong way. Redshirt junior Bobby Stahel went 2-for-4 at the plate and scored the only Trojan run of the game in the bottom of the eighth inning on a wild pitch.
USC and UCLA met earlier this season at the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic, in which the Trojans won 8-4 in the final game of the weekend. Eight of nine Trojans in the starting lineup had a hit in the victory, with five having multihit outings.
Currently, the Trojans hold a 25-7 overall record, 15-3 at home and 7-2 in the Pac-12, good for third place. The Bruins have a 23-6 overall record, an 8-1 record on the road and a 10-2 record in the Pac-12. The Bruins are in first place in the Pac-12, though the Bruins have played one more series than the Trojans.
Looking more closely at UCLA, the team is led by redshirt junior Kevin Kramer, who holds a .387 batting average, as well as three other players hitting well above .300.
Defensively, the Bruin bullpen is one of the toughest in the conference, led by senior David Berg and sophomore Grant Dyer, with a 1.21 ERA and a 1.61 ERA, respectively.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs believes that strong offensive starts remain key this weekend to combat the talented UCLA bullpen.
“If we can get the lead through the first six or seven innings, that will be really key for us,” Hubbs said. “The way Dyer and Berg have been pitching at the end of games, they’ve been really tough on teams and shutting it down. That’s something we want to focus on — getting aggressive early, getting on the board early and forcing them to have to come back, as opposed to us needing to come back. We want to have the lead and have them trying to force a comeback and trying to do different things.”
In terms of statistics, the Trojans have a team batting average of .305, while the Bruins maintain a .286 batting average. Also, USC has a 2.70 team ERA as opposed to UCLA’s 2.22.
Hubbs feels that both teams match up well, but the Trojans could have the advantage.
“I think we’ll have a bit of an edge because we’re pretty offensive and can throw strikes,” Hubbs said. “We’re two good teams with two good pitching staffs and two good offenses, so I think it’s gonna come down to who makes a big pitch and who makes a clutch hit in a big spot. Like anything in our conference, that’s what it comes down to. We’re confident that we match up well against them. We’ve played them tough in the past couple of years, so we just have to continue to do that.”
Now more than halfway through the season, this weekend could prove to be significant and relevant in addition to the automatic rivalry associated with this series, as both UCLA and USC want to emerge on top and move on to postseason play.
“Both teams are in the top 20, and that’s kind of what predicts postseason bursts, so I think putting yourself in a position not only for finishing first in league but being able to host a regional or possibly be a national-type seed,” Hubbs said. “I think all those things, when you’re playing another team that’s at the top in the country, come in to play when you’re making decisions.”
In spite of the mounting pressures, Hubbs feels that if the Trojans play clean baseball both offensively and defensively, they will be in a good  position to win.
“We just need to be able to mix pitches and get ahead in the count, and if we can do that, I think we’ll be in good shape,” Hubbs said. “I think we need to pitch well against them and not make mistakes. Their pitching staff is really good, and when you play a really good staff you have to hit the ball well and just plain play good baseball. I think if we do that, we can beat them and anyone else in the country.”
The first pitch in the crosstown rivalry is scheduled for today at 3 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

I usually try to keep this column related to USC sports or at least college sports, but with the NBA postseason just around the corner, there’s so much to talk about. Although the top seeds in both conferences are set, there’s so much mystery surrounding the upcoming playoffs.
Five teams are competing for the last two spots in the Eastern Conference, while seeds 2-7 in the Western Conference are anyone’s guess at this point. All of these mysteries will be solved by next week, but there is one debate that won’t end for at least another month: NBA MVP.
The way I see it, the MVP race is centered on Houston’s James Harden and Golden State’s Stephen Curry. Sorry Russell Westbrook: Your numbers have been great, throwing up triple-doubles like an Ice Cube song, but Curry and Harden have just been more consistent throughout the season.
With Westbrook out of the picture as his team fights for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, we are left with a true two-headed race for the first time since Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant back in the mid-2000s. Similar to those MVP races, this year’s boils down to the best statistical player (Harden/Kobe) against America’s favorite player on America’s favorite team (Curry/Nash).
To get a sense of how close this MVP race is, we have to look at what each player has accomplished on paper.
Curry, who plays for the league-best Warriors, has been on an absolute tear this season. The two-time All-Star averages 23.6 points, seven assists and four rebounds and is on the cusp of a 90-50-40 season despite shooting eight three-pointers a game. Curry has done all of this while playing a career-low 32 minutes per game, often sitting out fourth quarters because his team is blowing out the opponent.
Meanwhile, Harden is in the midst of his best NBA season. The six-year veteran is averaging a career-best and league-leading 27.6 points, with 6.9 assists and 5.8 rebounds.
Statistically speaking, Harden is having a superior season, even challenging Curry when it comes to getting his teammates involved in the offense. However, let’s dig a little deeper and see what each player brings to his respective team.
Curry has been by far the best point guard in the league this season, a savvy passer with unlimited range who always looks to get his teammates involved. The Warriors’ offense hinges on Curry’s ability to break into the lane and find a teammate or get off a screen and hit a 3-pointer. It’s no secret that Curry is a defensive liability, with the Warriors often hiding him on shoot-first shooting guards while having Klay Thompson guard Curry’s opponent.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, you have James Harden, arguably the league’s best player in a position lacking stars. Harden’s a player who loves to attack the rim and has no problem getting bail-out calls. Unlike Curry, Harden will often hold the ball for a majority of the shot clock before attacking, and more times than not, he’s bailed out by the refs. Though he has been called out for his lack of defensive effort in the past, Harden has made strides this season, avoiding many SportsCenter “Not Top 10” highlights.
Everything up to this point seems pretty even — two guards who pace their teams are having fantastic statistical seasons and play for the top two teams in the Western Conference. It isn’t until you look at their surrounding casts that you notice a large discrepancy.
Curry has had the privilege of playing with fellow All-Star Thompson — arguably forming the best backcourt in the NBA — along with former All-Stars Andrew Bogut and Andre Iguodala. On top of that, Draymond Green has had the biggest jump in the NBA and finds himself in the Defensive Player of                           the Year conversation.
Meanwhile, Harden has played three-quarters of the season without Houston’s best supporting players in Dwight Howard and Terrence Jones. Harden often finds himself surrounded by Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley, Donatas Motiejunas and Joey Dorsey. Somehow the Beard has carried that team to 2-seed in the Western Conference.
Take Harden off the Rockets and they are a lottery-bound team. Take Curry off the Warriors and they are still fighting for a top-5 seed. Harden might not be the best player, or America’s favorite player, but he has been by far the most vaaluable player on his team.
Unfortunately for Harden, Curry is almost surely going to win the MVP. People love to watch Curry drain impossible, off-balance 3s and don’t care so much for the whining,        foul-searching Harden and his cast of villains.
Sometimes the most valuable player doesn’t win the award, and that’s how life is. Just ask Kobe Bryant.

On March 27, Ellen Pao lost her discrimination case against Kleiner Perkins, one of Silicon Valley’s most famous venture capital firms. Pao joined Kleiner in 2005 as chief of staff and soon became a junior investing partner. This case became one of the most prominent trials in Silicon Valley for several reasons.
According to Pao, the powerful venture capital firm held her back from promotions and other opportunities because she was a woman. Furthermore, Pao said that the company retaliated against her when she spoke up in 2011 and fired her when she filed a lawsuit in 2012 for $16 million in compensation for punitive damages. The court’s decision in the case is a wake up call to the tech industry for its discriminatory practices.
In a recent New Yorker piece, Stanford Law School professor Deborah Rhode said that the evidence presented in the case “is very typical of what’s out there in Silicon Valley.” She further explained that “there are no smoking guns; much of it is what social scientists call micro-indignities — small incidents that viewed individually may seem trivial, but when viewed cumulatively point to a practice of insensitivity and devaluation that can get in the way of work performance.”
Silicon Valley is an area that has been heralded as an economic panacea and is often deemed to be a prototype for places around the globe that seek rapid economic growth and incorporation into the international market. For a place that is so highly regarded in the world of tech, cases such as Pao’s exemplify the wrong set of ideas for the world to follow. As reported by The New York Times, nearly half of all publicly traded information technology businesses have no women on their boards. This doesn’t seem to improve the mentality of the individuals already concerned about persistent sexism.
The concern, however, isn’t limited to the lack of opportunities for women in the tech field. The bigger picture includes other gender discrimination realities rooted in all sorts of stages in a company, from the initial stage of recruitment to the final stage of payment. Despite constituting 58 percent of all university graduates, women make up less than 8 percent of the top corporate-level positions. A U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics list of the most prevalent occupations for employed women shows that the top jobs for women are administrative assistants, nurses, teachers, cashiers and retail salespersons. Women are still more likely to land a job that doesn’t involve much authority.
One of the possible reasons why women don’t bother trying to fight for a higher position could be the discrimination they face once they have achieved that status. On average, women who work full-time earn about 78 cents for every dollar a full-time male worker earns. A far more astonishing finding suggests that in 2013, the average pay of women working full-time fell by 0.9 percent. The persistent lack of gender equality in the form of pay rate or recruitment opportunities at workplaces ties back to the claim that women, in general, are not viewed to be on par with men.
Also, at many tech companies in Silicon Valley and nationwide, only a fraction of the technical staff — only 2 percent to 4 percent in some cases — are women. With these statistics in mind, it’s important that people dig deeper and eradicate the root of sexism. Psychological factors contribute to women’s underrepresentation in certain high-level careers. An NYU study has shown that women repeatedly downplay their achievements and undervalue themselves when working alongside men. Thus, it is understandable why women might have lower self-esteem, in general, than men.
To tackle cases such as Pao’s, companies need to ensure that they create a corporate culture that promotes integrity and high-caliber work despite gender differences. It also involves action from people outside the corporate world as well. The promotion of education is the best solution to gender inequality. It should be taught that women, in fact, can do anything that men can, especially in the tech field.
Have you ever considered that Pao’s husband, Fletcher,  influenced her to do this? Do you even know about him, and his character?

Has Yik Yak ever done anything good for anybody? I ask that question with no sense of sarcasm: I cannot think of a single app with as much downside as Yik Yak, an app that allows users to post anonymous, 200-character messages to a platform accessible to anyone within a mile-and-a-half radius. Not only does the app encourage people to express themselves without any responsibility, it gives anyone from cyber bullies to blatant racists a widely read platform to speak with total anonymity. Universities across the nation should do everything in their power to keep it from infecting their campuses. Case in point: the latest controversy at USC.
In a Huffington Post blog, a USC freshman unleashed a slew of inflammatory accusations directed at Rini Sampath and Jordan Fowler, the newly elected Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president. The article, which reads more like a recap of The Real Housewives of Orange County, labeled the pair’s administration a “full-fledge nepotism scandal,” accused them of “vote buying” and referenced an “upswell of students who want the two impeached.” But when you take off the emperor’s clothes, it seems a bunch of Yik Yak posts over the weekend are the basis for every claim the blog makes (it contains no on-the-record statements or sources). Though the piece bordered on libel, it did have one good point: Despite so many student critics on Yik Yak, why was only one person at the “Meet the Candidates” event held before the election?
In a Facebook post, USG justifiably condemned the nonsense, but they lacked a proposal to move that conversation forward. Here’s one: The USG Senate should pass a resolution that requests the university take steps to end Yik Yak’s presence on campus.
Before you start on me for censoring free speech, consider that even Yik Yak knows that some people don’t deserve its service. After it spread to middle and high schools and brought with it rampant harassment and threats of school shootings, founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington constructed virtual “geo-fences” around 90 percent of the nation’s primary and secondary schools to prevent the app’s usage. The USC incident proves that this distinction might be arbitrary; 15 minutes on the USC Yik Yak feed will leave any reasonable person convinced that the maturity level of some folks at USC hasn’t evolved since the ninth grade.
Racism, bullying and public humiliation are intolerable in any civil society, and Yik Yak makes it easier for people to spread that vitriol with zero responsibility for it. The New York Times said, “[Yik Yak] has been used to issue threats of mass violence on more than a dozen college campuses, including the University of North Carolina, Michigan State University and Penn State. Racist, homophobic and misogynist “yaks” have generated controversy at many more, among them Clemson, Emory, Colgate and the University of Texas. At Kenyon College, a “yakker” proposed a gang rape at the school’s women’s center.”
It’s only a matter of time before USC gets added to that list. Oops! We already have. When black students at USC expressed support for constructing their own cultural house, similar to ones for other student organizations, one yak from USC — “Why would they open a prison on the Row?” — was printed in the Los Angeles Times. It reflected poorly on every USC student, but because of Yik Yak’s privacy policy, the writer will never be held accountable. The app, on the other hand, should be.
Such a proposal has limitations. People can still use the app if they are far enough from campus, and they will surely find other anonymous forums to spew their hatred. But USC, and any other university concerned with being a welcoming environment for a diverse student population, needs to send the message that this stuff is intolerable. It’s the beginning of what has to be a long and difficult conversation about campus culture, one which many USC students will tell you they don’t feel welcome in.
Yik Yak represents the worst reaction of our generation to social media: Instead of understanding that everything put online is public, along with our names, we’ve invented things that allow us to say things irresponsibly. Promoting this “no accountability” culture is the beginning of a violently divided society. If Yik Yak has done something good for you, I’d love to hear it. But my suspicion is, the folks who rant on Yik Yak run with the same crowd that criticizes their student leaders but won’t show up to meet them before the election. In that case, they might only notice that someone is trying to take Yik Yak away when the app disappears. By distracting its most ardent supporters from efforts to wipe it from existence, the app will have done something good for everybody.

how about insteadof upvoting the racist comment or yak,why dont yall downvote and block all yaks from the immature person? its fucking common sence people. think a bit
Of course some of the comments on Yik Yak are immature.  You do have to use some of your judgement to weed out the inane comments, but yes, Yik Yak has done some good.  It is the first place where I heard about Zooey Deschanel in the bookstore, the FedEx truck hitting a biker on the row, another booty bandit strike, and that naked pledge running around in Leavey.  Yik Yak can be used to disseminate information, draw attention to issues or events, or just to check the pulse of the student body.  If USG actually thought about utilizing this app in a productive way instead of just trying to oust it, and pissing off a lot of the students in the process, we maybe could get somewhere.
Banning Yik Yak doesn’t do change the fact that our student body has a bunch of racist, sexist dillweeds. If anything, Yik Yak revealed it. Try fixing the attitudes and teaching students how to be decent human beings, rather than just hiding the behavior.
Exactly, the app should stay.
I am not a fan of Yik Yak, as I don’t see it as a stimulating environment or one appropriate for adults in a university. It is highly immature, filled with racist comments, and a completely ridiculous social media platform our society has come to embrace. Nevertheless, as much as I would like for it to disappear, it can’t and it shouldn’t. For those who like it, let them continue using it and wasting their time. And for those who don’t like it, distance yourself and get over it. Though it is hard to see how stupid people are becoming.
u can mute all posts from the racist user. if everyone mutes the immature persons yaks, then he will not be yakking to anyone but himself
To answer the question you started this article with: yes, Yik Yak has done good. I am sure I am not the only that reads yaks for pure comic value. Yaks that are racist, misogynist, or bullying are almost always either removed by being flagged or voted off. There is no excuse for inflammatory language of this sort on any platform, but straight up removing the app from USC is a lazy solution. By your argument, Facebook, Twitter, and just about every social media platform should be banned from campus use. All of the the things you take issue with on Yik Yak happen on every other platform. Yes Yik Yak is different because of the anonymity, but put some thought into a real solution instead of just taking the expedient nuclear option just to get clicks on your article. But I wouldn’t expect too much based on your body of work. You default to highly bombastic and largely overblown solutions and language regardless of the topic. I just wish you would put more thought and effort into representing left leaning positions in the USC community. Every right leaning person I know would point to some of your articles as simply left wing media bias and dismiss the views without a further thought. Please, put more thought and effort into your writing.

A persistent casting rumor has left the James Bond fan base shaken and stirred.
For the past few months, speculation has been swirling around British actor Idris Elba as a potential replacement for current 007 Daniel Craig if and when the Skyfall star decides to hand over the keys to the Aston Martin. Craig, of course, still has two movies left on his contract, including this November’s feverishly anticipated Spectre, but facts have never stopped the online hoi polloi before. In this case, however, such excitement is well founded. After all, if Elba lands the role, he’ll be the first-ever black actor to don the tux.
The 42-year-old thespian, best known to U.S. audiences for his critically lauded performance as drug-dealing businessman Stringer Bell on HBO’s The Wire and brief but memorable appearances in blockbusters such as the Thor series and Pacific Rim, has been touted as Craig’s likely successor ever since his name first appeared in a leaked email written by Amy Pascal, the now-former chairwoman of Sony Pictures, during last winter’s heavily publicized hacking scandal. The missive in question was addressed to Elizabeth Cantillon, the former executive vice president of production at Columbia Pictures — the same studio that distributes the Bond series. That link was all the fans needed to start roaring their approval or airing their concerns over the notion of making Bond, often described as an avatar for swaggering cultural imperialism, a non-white character.
Such complaints might seem racist — and some of them undoubtedly are — but it’s important to remember that every potential new Bond has faced a ridiculous amount of scrutiny, both from fans and the franchise’s equally merciless producers. Craig himself was ridiculed for his blond hair, blue eyes and alleged inability to drive a stick shift prior to the release of Casino Royale in 2006. Pierce Brosnan was initially dismissed as a “pretty boy.” Timothy Dalton’s Shakespearean background worked against him. Roger Moore was denounced as a snobby, cartoonish fop. George Lazenby was condemned for being an Australian male model with no previous acting experience. Even Sean Connery, widely considered to be the best 007 of all time, had trouble convincing series creator Ian Fleming that he was the right man for the job. In fact, upon meeting Connery in 1961, the author famously remarked, “I’m looking for Commander Bond, not an over-grown stuntman.”
A debate like this has a way of exposing hypocrites or dragging in unsuspecting victims, depending on whom you ask. Last week, former 007 Roger Moore found himself at the center of a social media hate storm after the French weekly news magazine Paris Match quoted him as saying that Elba wasn’t “English-English” enough to pursue the Bond role, apparently ignoring the fact that Elba was born and bred in London. Moore took to Twitter to defend himself, explaining that his quote had been taken out of context and that he was actually referring to an old joke he had once made about Cuba Gooding, Jr. — a joke that referred to the Jerry Maguire actor’s nationality, not his race. Nevertheless, the damage was done, and the retired spy quickly learned that SPECTRE has nothing on today’s breed of Internet trolls.
Make no mistake, though: Whether it’s an origin story or a costume or the overarching continuity of a long-running series, it’s nearly always foolish to change something merely for the sake of changing it. The practice of “race-bending” beloved characters can range from the weirdly arbitrary — last December’s horrendous Annie remake — to the flat-out insulting — M. Night Shyamalan’s decision to cast white actors to play East Asian characters in his abortive live-action adaptation of The Last Airbender. One of the more egregious recent examples is Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings, a plodding biblical epic where hundreds of African and Middle Eastern actors were relegated to the sidelines while Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton gorged themselves on scenery as a gravel-throated Moses and a Ramses who wore more eyeliner than the bassist from Green Day.
If the new 007 is going to depart from Fleming’s literary canon — Bond’s ethnicity is explicitly described as being half Scottish, half Swedish in the pages of You Only Live Twice, which was itself a testament to the author’s improved opinion of Connery after seeing the film version of Dr. No — there needs to be a reason beyond a cynical desire to grab headlines by condescending to those who confuse pandering for progressive action.
The ideal reason for casting Elba would be that he is simply the best actor for the part, a scenario that seems likely, despite his relative age (he’s only five years younger than Craig). He is, after all, an internationally acclaimed performer with natural magnetism, an impressive range and years of experience working in large franchises. If he wins the role by trumping the competition — an impressive list that is said to include the likes of Michael Fassbender, Tom Hiddleston and Tom Hardy — then he will have earned his passage into one of the most exclusive fraternities in the world (only six members and counting so far). If he becomes the seventh, something tells me it won’t be hard to guess his preferred codename.

Why you are even bother by ‘gravely throated moses’? If its that bad just just leave it. Why you want the great coloured actors to be part of it? LOL. Or you are worried that people/children are just as dumb to see Christian Bale on screen and goes ‘Oh! Moses was exactly like that’.  But if you think there are many coloured actors who could have chosen over Christian Bale  then you are totally wrong. Not any white one also. Acting wise Christian Bale is such a talent that offering any role to him by anyone is justified. The final outcome is good or bad is a different question overall and in case of movies its subjective. My point is that if you are saying (rightfully so) while casting James Bond race should not be consider then you also should not judge any other film racially (or just to please others). Just don’t insult any Talent considering his race.  Christian Bale’s talent and dedication can allow him play any role even by lapping black colour. And aren’t Will Smith, Eddie Murphy, Jamie Fox, Denzel Washington get more roles than many other white actors because of their talent and box-office credibility? In India at least we dont judge actors by their religion or caste or colour. Shahrukh Khan can play Hindu King Ashoka and Hrithik Rosahn can play Akbar the Great and both were loved by Hindu and Muslims alike (and criticized alike if they acted badly). You are welcome to have a research on this fact. So if Idris Elba should given to play a role only on basis of his talent then in comparison to Idris Elba’s talent Christian Bale was rightfully given the role of Moses (or any role). Keep up your campaigning, but dont insult  any  talented actor. Its just wrong.

Students who have tired eyes from reading countless textbooks and e-textbooks this semester can take a break at the California Science Center to visit “Dead Sea Scrolls: The Exhibition.” It is an exciting and interactive presentation of artifacts that includes what many believe to be the most important discovery of ancient manuscripts.
It is strongly recommended that visitors purchase their tickets in advance, as there is a set entry time on each ticket. Guests are asked to form a line outside the exhibit so that all of the guests with a certain start time may enter together.
The first room in the exhibit is a dark, round space with six large screens and three clay vessels. A museum guide gives an introductory presentation about the exhibit, explaining the history of the scrolls and their significance while the screens show clips pertaining to the presentation.
In order to appreciate the importance of the scrolls, one must understand their origins. Discovered in 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls were buried in caves for thousands of years. Some argue that the scrolls are connected to the town of Qumran, which was home to Jewish ascetics known as Essenes. Some scientists doubt that the Essenes wrote the scrolls, however, and instead argue that the site of the excavations went through two distinct periods of development between 120-68 B.C., so its purpose might have radically changed over time. Though there were remains of about 900 separate scrolls found in the caves 13 miles east of Jerusalem, the exhibit contains fragments of 10 different scrolls. The guide makes sure to highlight that all artifacts in this exhibit are originals and are courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Though some items are displayed without any protective encasing, there are no replicas.
The vessel closest to the entrance, for example, is not protected by any glass whatsoever, which is particularly notable as it was the property of an ancient Israeli king, making it an invaluable historical artifact.
As soon as the guide finishes, a side door is opened and guests are asked to step out into a hallway. Visitors are informed that there is no chronological order in which one should view the exhibit. This first dark hallway serves as a timeline, with artifacts displayed on the wall and dates relating to these artifacts written with light on the ground. The collection includes post, coins, weapons, jewelry and writings found around the same time as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Unfortunately, because of large crowds, it might be difficult to view this portion of the exhibit, and many people take their time viewing the artifacts.
It is interesting to note that throughout the entire exhibit, biblical quotations are presented before the information on the information boards; however, the entire exhibit uses B.C.E. and C.E. to identify dates rather than B.C. and A.D. in order to acknowledge cultural diversity.
Further down the hallway there is a large television screen with interactive maps and additional information about the location where these artifacts were found. The hallway leads into a dimly lit room with three large clay vessels, which were found in Canaan. At the back of this room is a model of a four-room house, representing a typical residence from the Iron Age (1200-550 B.C.). Following this room is another dark hallway containing several clay vessels, limestone proto-Aeolic capitals (1000-586 B.C.) from Hazor’s citadel gate, as well as iron arrowheads and other small artifacts.
At the end of this hall is a large round room containing the highlight of the exhibit: the Dead Sea Scrolls. The scrolls are presented in a circular exhibit in the center of the room, with a clay vessel in the center. The scrolls have little to no direct light on them and are encased in protective netting as well as glass, as they are extremely fragile. Since the scrolls are a historical treasure that attracts large crowds, they are mostly obscured by the large crowd that comes to view them. Instead of having a start and finish point, guests can move around from scroll to scroll randomly, causing great confusion and disorganization.
There are biblical and non-biblical scrolls, such as marriage contracts, with translations written in English next to the fragments. On the outside walls of this round room are exhibits highlighting Solomon’s Temple, the rise and fall of Jerusalem, and the Abrahamic roots of the scrolls, as this connects them to Christianity, Judaism and Islam. There is also a small side room dedicated to the Ten Commandments, including an interactive video where guests can zoom in on each of the commandments and hear an audio explanation.
Toward the end of the exhibit is a final hallway that presents a stone believed to have fallen from the Western Wall where one can write messages containing wishes or prayers that will be collected by the Israel Antiquities Authority and delivered to Jerusalem. In the brightly illuminated main hall of the California Science Center, there are more interactive displays about the science of studying the scrolls, including information on DNA analysis of the scrolls’ animal skin and steps for future preservation.
Though very crowded, this exhibit is definitely worth the wait. Dead Sea Scrolls: The Exhibition will be on display until Sept. 7

It’s been a minute since Empire first launched its pilot. Now, 12 titillating episodes later, this Fox drama has hooked 23 million viewers, with our First Lady Michelle Obama among the first to confess unbridled passion for the show.
The show has got all the makings of a melodrama — a gay son with a homophobic father, a fierce ex-wife, a dying man, murder, cheating, money — every element imaginable. It’s hard to imagine that all that melodrama could fit under a veil of sophistication. But Empire has certainly done just that, and everyone in Hollywood is trying to figure out how. The answer: hip-hop.
One of the key reasons behind Empire’s success is that the show treats the complex subject and genre of hip-hop with unwavering attention and utmost seriousness. By plotting out the timeline of Lucious Lyon’s life as he progresses from a dope-dealing gangster to the CEO of a publicly traded company, Empire explores the changing nature of the hip-hop industry itself.
With its roots in the streets of New York, hip-hop began as rebellious, subversive and almost synonymous with criminal activity. It wasn’t uncommon for rappers to celebrate criminality and their defiance of the police. Over the years, hip-hop grew more popular and rappers became more legitimate. Though artists such as Dr. Dre, Jay-Z and Kanye West talk about their tough origins, they still are, at the end of the day, successful entrepreneurs. They’re symbols of high financial and social status — not representatives of the gang life.
Empire plays off of the growing popularity of hip-hop culture and embodies the struggle of that powerful music genre in the character of Lyon, a man held back by his “gangster” past while, at the same time, striving to forge a life of wealth and status in mainstream society.

We’ve all been there. You’re running a few minutes late and pedal your bike faster, picking up speed to make up for lost time and (hopefully) get to class on time. But your plan is soon foiled when you suddenly have to slam on your brakes to avoid hitting the masses of people traversing campus. Now that USC has sent acceptance letters to the potential members of the class of 2019, tour groups are a constant presence on campus as high schoolers decide whether or not USC is the right fit. As you make your way around — or through — the packs of contemplative high school seniors and eager parents led by an enthusiastic, backwards-walking tour guide, a few thoughts likely run through your mind.
1) Aww…I remember the first time I toured!
Spotting tour groups makes it easy to feel nostalgic for the days when you were in their shoes. You remember weaving through campus and listening to the tour guide talk about the flags in VKC and the kicking of the poles. If this tour had been before decisions came out, you would have been mentally calculating  your own academic stats against USC admitted student averages. If it had been after you received your acceptance, you would still in disbelief that you got in, wondering there had been some sort of a mistake.
And now, if you happen to be near Bovard when you spot a tour, you can’t help but remember your first group chant of “Fight on!” or your first obligatory picture with Tommy Trojan. Ah, to be young again.

2) Are they looking at me? Do I look okay? Be cool — act the way Trojans should so that they get a good picture of student life.
Once the nostalgic daydreaming ends, you realize that you are, in fact, riding right past the tour group. Given that you’re probably wearing backpack, they know you’re a student. Chances are, they’re going to glance at you, marveling at the wonder that is the college student. Maybe you woke up late and are looking a little disheveled. You worry that you are going to singlehandedly give the students and parents a bad impression of the school. You smile at them to signal that you’re not as much of the mess you might appear to be. Stay calm. Act natural.

3) They’re all staring longingly….
It’s no secret that college life is better than high school life, so when prospective students see you, they’re likely going to stare longingly, wishing they could be in your place. If they have not yet been accepted, they’re jealous that you got in and are eagerly awaiting their own decision. If they’re already in, they are probably in the middle of a bout of senioritis and want nothing more than to leave for college already. Pass by politely and smile to reassure them that good things will come for them in due time.

4) Is that my friend giving a tour right now…?
Why yes, yes it is. And you better shout at them to fight on because we all love hearing them shout back as many “Fight on’s” as possible.

 
“But your plan is soon foiled when you suddenly have to slam on your breaks to avoid hitting the masses of people traversing campus.”-BRAKES, not “breaks.”
