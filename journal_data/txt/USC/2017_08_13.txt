The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is receiving a multimillion dollar renovation. 
“It’s a very ambitious project — a $270 million renovation — and we are well down the road on it,” USC Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone said.  
The first phase of the makeover took place prior to the 2016 football season with the installation of new stadium lighting. The 2017 football season will be the first with high-definition video boards on the upper east corner of the stadium, which were installed in April. 
Construction will not commence until the upcoming football season has ended. Starting in the winter, the south tower will be entirely renovated to include new premium spaces, suites, club seats and a new railing. Seats will be replaced to allow fans more leg-room, and new aisles will be installed to make navigating the Coliseum easier. 
Some reseating will be necessary for the 2018 football season during stadium construction. All renovations should be complete by the 2019 season, when complete fan reseating will take place. 
The Coliseum’s capacity will be reduced by approximately 16,000 seats, leaving 77,500 widened seats with increased legroom. The renovations will also make space for Scholarship Club Tower with suites, club seats and a new concourse. 
Tessalone said the drop in stadium capacity will still make USC’s home field in line with the number of seats in new stadiums being built. A thorough analysis found the seat number sufficient to accommodate the fanbase, Tessalone said. 
The project makes it a priority to restore the historic peristyle of the Coliseum and will bring back the framed arches to the stadium. While keeping the historic integrity of the Coliseum intact, the project will modernize the stadium by equipping it with faster Wi-Fi and an updated press box. 
The planned press box will be called the Otis Booth Press Box, named after Franklin Otis Booth Jr. — a newspaper executive whose philanthropy has benefited several institutions in Los Angeles.
Although the Coliseum is a Los Angeles institution, USC Athletics is funding the construction in its entirety. No student fees or government funds will be used for the renovation. The project will be paid for through Coliseum restoration gifts, sponsorship revenue, the venue’s non-USC events and donor-naming options. 
“The athletic department is self-sufficient,” Tessalone said. “We are charged with balancing our budget and raising the necessary revenue to balance it … whether it’s through fundraising, sponsorships, media rights, ticket sales or merchandise.”
USC has been exploring a naming rights contract since 2013, and has made this task a priority in recent months. Reports have said the University is close to reaching a $70 million, 15-year naming rights deal with United Airlines. The University has not confirmed these reports. 
“As part of its agreement to operate the L.A. Coliseum and to support the renovations, the restorations and the operation of the Coliseum, USC has been pursuing a naming rights arrangement with various entities,” Tessalone said. “At this time, no naming rights deal has been finalized.” 
The Coliseum was built in 1923; it hosted the Olympic games twice in 1932 and 1984 and is currently being used by the USC Trojans and the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams will play in the Coliseum until the 2020 season, when they will move to their newly built stadium in Inglewood. 
“The Coliseum needed to be renovated. It was an old building … it is in need of major upgrades. A lot of it was, quite frankly, falling apart,” Tessalone said. “It will make the gameday experience better for our fans, it’s going to give our football team a first-class facility, it’s going to provide revenue that will not only fund football but all 21 of our sports.”

The Undergraduate Student Government has spent three years attempting to implement a fall break into the academic calendar. In April, USG presented evidence supporting the mental health benefits students would reap from a fall break to the Academic Senate, which unanimously voted in favor of the proposal.
Steven Kramer | Daily Trojan
The proposal will be presented to President C. L.  Max Nikias, Provost Michael Quick, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Director of Campus Activities Gabriel Valenzuela. If it passes, the University will add a two-day break to the academic calendar beginning in Fall 2018. 
Although the initial proposal by USG suggests placing the break on the eighth week of fall semester, USG President Austin Dunn and USG Director of Wellness Affairs Mariana Hrovat both said that a date will not be finalized until senior administrators make their final decision. The break could fall between the eighth and 10th week of the semester, according to Dunn and Hrovat.
In previous years, the resolution failed due to the lack of evidence proving the positive impacts the fall break. Paula Cannon, who previously served as president of the Academic Senate, has served on the Senate each time the break was proposed. She believes that fall break resolutions failed because of the way they were presented to senior administrators. 
“The Undergraduate Student Government officers didn’t do a very good job of pitching it to the faculty,” Cannon said. “Although I feel like I understood the points they were making about mental health issues, I felt that their arguments weren’t resonating with the faculty in the room.”
According to Cannon, a good deal of past hesitation resided in the belief that students would take advantage of the break in other forms, like taking vacations and partying, instead of focusing on restoring their mental health. 
The University’s fall semester has 56 continuous instructional days — the most of any top-25 school in the nation, according to the USG proposal. USG worked with Ilene Rosenstein, director of counseling and psychological services at the USC Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity, and the Engemann Student Health Center to evaluate the Behavioral Health Measure of students who visited the counseling center during fall semesters from 2012 to 2016. 
The BHM is a self-report that assesses students’ mental health and general psychological distress on a four-point scale. A low BHM score signifies more distress in students.
“[It is considered] a psychological issue, problem, diagnosis or psychopathy with a BHM hitting in at about 2.5,” Hrovat said. “When we were looking at the average BHM scores on students during the middle of fall semester, it was at a 2.6.”
Along with consulting with the health center, last year’s USG President, Edwin Saucedo, and then-USG Vice President Austin Dunn conducted forums with Nikias and Quick to solidify a proper resolution. 
“Having discussion after discussion, asking as many questions as possible, and receiving as much faculty, staff and student input as possible allowed us to really put in the work to find the research for the proposal,” Dunn said. 
Though the final decision will come down to Nikias and Quick, Dunn said he is optimistic about a fall break being implemented in the near future.
“At this point it really is in the hands of President Nikias and Provost Quick, and even they seem on board with it, so I think now it’s just a matter of finalizing all the details to get it enacted,” Dunn said.
USG has not been informed when the administration will release their decision. 
The Office of the President could not be reached for comment.

Ground Zero Performance Café will be closed during the upcoming year for renovations, the student-run business announced on their Facebook page on Aug. 10.
“With heavy hearts are we making this announcement,” the announcement said. “We are extremely saddened that Ground Zero will be closed this next year.”
The café, which features live student performances, University-sponsored events and a menu of coffee drinks and milkshakes, will open for scheduled events in the fall semester but stay completely closed during the spring semester, according to the post. 
Piper Nylen, the general manager of Ground Zero, said campus organizations can still schedule events for the fall, but the space will not open for studying nor beverages.
According to Nylen, the renovations should not extend past next year, though an exact construction plan has not yet been finalized. She said the decision to close the café for the upcoming year was made by USC administrators, not by the students who work there.
“The café is old and needs attention and revamps to keep up with modern businesses,” Nylen said. “The baristas and the Ground Zero community are very devastated [with its closing].”
She added that the renovations will include a redo of the coffee bar area, the addition of restrooms and a fresh coat of paint, among other things. Nylen said that, at this time, there is no plan to remove the stage setup the café currently holds.
Jacob Surovsky, a sophomore member of Commedus Interruptus, an improv group that performs at the café on a weekly basis, said that his organization has an event schedule at Ground Zero for the upcoming semester.
“It’s a really huge bummer. Ground Zero is a space that is very different than anything on the rest of campus,” Surovsky said. “I really hope the renovations do not take away from the energy the space has right now.”
Nylen said there is no plan to relocate the café for the upcoming year.
Trojan Events and Service, the body that oversees Ground Zero, had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.

Erica Muhl, dean of the USC Roski School of Art and Design, will not renew her deanship when her term expires in 2018, and will transition into her role as the inaugural dean of the Iovine and Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation.
Muhl is scheduled to transition after her Roski deanship concludes. Provost Quick has appointed a task force committee to begin a nationwide search for the next dean of the Roski School this fall.
As the founding executive director of the Iovine and Young Academy in May 2013, Muhl has contributed to the Academy’s growth since she was appointed in Fall 2014. Muhl also contributed to the launch of Design@USC, an online program which offers a Master of Science in integrated design, business and technology. 
“The Academy will take a leap forward in scope in the next few months with the groundbreaking of its new building and the launch of its first graduate program,” said Quick in a letter addressed to faculty, staff and students at Roski. “In order to devote full time to the Academy as it takes its critical next steps, Dean Muhl has decided not to seek another term as dean of USC Roski as her current term expires.”
In May 2015, Muhl faced criticism when all seven of Roski Master’s of Fine Arts students withdrew from the school, protesting curriculum and funding changes, loss of faculty and Muhl’s appointment. The Roski School has also dropped in its national U.S. News and World Report rankings — from No. 36 in 2012 for its MFA program to No. 69 in 2016.
Since the controversy, Muhl has appointed internationally recognized artists and scholars to Roski’s faculty and increased the number of Roski’s tenured faculty by 18 percent. She has also raised both full- and part-time salaries since 2013. 
This fall, Muhl, along with faculty committees, will be rolling out Roski’s recrafted curriculum. Renewed for bachelor’s degrees in both art and design, the curriculum maintains Roski’s strong studio model while allowing students to more easily craft cross-media and cross-disciplinary practices. The new program will also provide select students access to work closely with faculty members and learn in a mentorship program.
Over the last three years, there has been a 26 percent overall increase in Roski applications and a nearly 20 percent increase in enrolled students. New gifts to provide undergraduate scholarships have increased merit aid for students by 66 percent. Facilities have also been taken into consideration, with $750,000 in upgrades and renovations since 2012.
“I’m tremendously proud of all we have accomplished together,” Muhl said in a letter regarding her time at USC Roski. “Our students are already profiting from the deep investment in the growth and increasing diversity of the faculty body, new programs, student aid, facilities and pre- and post-graduation opportunities.”

USC Student Affairs and the Keck School of Medicine appointed Dr. Sarah Van Orman as the chief medical officer of student health on Aug. 1. In this position, she will oversee the two student health centers on the University Park and Health Sciences campus, respectively.
Van Orman was previously the University of Wisconsin’s university health services director for nearly a decade. “I’ve spent my entire career in college health and working with students,” Van Orman said, in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
 She tackled various issues in her work such as sexual violence, excessive alcohol use, mental health and classroom safety during her term and developed a comprehensive strategy on student wellness.
 As the chief medical health officer at USC, Van Orman will focus on improving clinical services to students, while developing a comprehensive public health plan through analyzing medical data and working with health professionals to address students’ needs and concerns.
 “My first goal is, of course, getting to know the staff at Engemann and at the health centers, but I also want to focus on getting to know the students,” Van Orman said. “I want to try and understand what health issues students prioritize, the things they value and their needs. That, in many ways, will guide what our priorities are here at the health center.” There also have been some administrative shifts with Van Orman’s arrival: Keck Medicine of USC will now oversee clinical health services at the two student health centers. Engemann Health Center, the University Park campus’ center, previously operated under USC Student Affairs.
 As the former chief health officer at UW, Van Orman took initiative to be the school’s public health leader in improving students’ overall wellness. During Van Orman’s term at UW, the school’s data reflected a decrease in high-risk alcohol consumption, especially among first-year students.
 Curbing alcohol abuse will also be one of Van Orman’s health priorities as she takes on her position at USC. But, alcohol consumption is only one of four defining health concerns that impact students on campus, Van Orman says.
 “There’s four big issues we know at USC and on other campuses that impact students’ wellbeing,” Van Orman said. “These include mental health and overall wellness. We know sexual violence really impacts students’ mental wellbeing. Also, issues of diversity and inclusion really impact students’ experience, alongside high-risk alcohol consumption.” These four issues were previously identified by Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry.
 Beyond specific health concerns, Van Orman expressed the importance of campus climate and its potential to positively impact students’ wellbeing.
 “The term of the Trojan Family really struck me: this idea that students feel connected to each other on campus,” Van Orman said. She believes encouraging student engagement with one another can be a key aspect in reducing mental health issues, stress, anxiety and loneliness.
 Van Orman views comprehensive wellness and a focus on long-term issues essential to fostering a healthy campus environment for all students, and she seeks to better understand students in order to effectively aid them.
 “I’m really excited to get to know students,” Van Orman said. “I think every campus has a unique culture of students, and I’m looking forward to learning what their hopes are and what their interests are while seeing patients.”
