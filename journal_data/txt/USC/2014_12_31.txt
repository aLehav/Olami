Since USC’s Holiday Bowl win over Nebraska, the Trojans have already lost defensive end Leonard Williams to the NFL draft, and now media reports indicate that the Trojans will be without offensive line coach Tim Drevno, who will join Jim Harbaugh as Michigan’s offensive coordinator. Though neither USC nor Michigan has released any official statements regarding the news, USC redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Zach Banner tweeted his congratulations to Drevno on his “new job.”
Drevno served as Harbaugh’s offensive coordinator at University of San Diego from 2004-2006, a tight ends coach and offensive line coach at Stanford from 2007-2010 and Harbaugh’s offensive line coach with the 49ers from 2011-2013.
Drevno spent 2014 with the Trojans as offensive line coach and running game coordinator. USC ranked 68th in the nation in rushing offense under Drevno. The 49ers, however, were a top five rushing team in 2012 and 2013 under Drevno.
The news that USC is now missing an offensive line coach could potentially impact recruitment. More updates will follow as the story develops.
Here are Banner’s tweets:
That’s 4 new Oline coaches I’ve had in 4 years. As a human-being I am frustrated, but as a player I will continue to get better and move on!

I am happy for Coach Drev and wish him luck with his new job because he deserves it. He has a great opportunity. I love that guy.

Arman Marwah, a current student on leave from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, died suddenly on Dec. 26. He was 22.
“The USC Annenberg community is deeply saddened by the loss of this young man. Our thoughts and condolences are with Arman’s family and friends” said Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III and Sarah Banet-Weiser, director of the School of Communication, in a joint statement to the Daily Trojan.
Marwah was born and raised in Hong Kong, though he finished high school in New York at The Dwight School.
Gideon Welles, a friend of Marwah and USC alum, remembers Marwah for his fun-loving spirit.
“Arman was always the entertainer,” Welles said. “Even after 10 years of knowing him, his ability to light up a room with humor never ceased to amaze me. Such was his charm that strangers quickly became friends. He was sure to leave an impression.”
After taking leave from USC in spring 2014, Marwah returned to Hong Kong to work in international business development. He had recently been promoted to a manager position.
According to Marwah’s sister, Alia Eyres, Marwah treasured his time at USC.
“Arman loved living in California during college and made friends for life at USC and in his fraternity [Sigma Phi Epsilon],” she said.
Marwah was on vacation in Laos with a friend he met at USC when he passed away.
Marwah, who was the youngest of seven siblings, was known for being devoted to his family and especially close to his niece and nephews.
“He spent a lot of time with his nephews and niece, and although he had a reputation for being cool, most people didn’t know that he went to play with his nephews most days after work,” Eyres said.
Many remember Marwah as a faithful, caring friend.
“Arman was one of the most genuinely compassionate human beings I’ve ever met in my life,” said David Bessin, a friend of Marwah and USC alum. “He was always there for me and had undying loyalty to his friends.”
Marwah is survived by his parents, grandparents, four sisters, two brothers and four nieces and nephews. A memorial for Marwah will be held in Hong Kong on Jan. 2.
Saharra Griffin contributed to his report. 
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that Marwah graduated from USC. That is incorrect. He was a current student on leave from USC. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
