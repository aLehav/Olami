For those who don’t know, “Ace Attorney” is a series of games that involve players playing as lawyers proving the innocence of a variety of characters accused of committing crimes. The first games were written and directed by Shu Takumi until it passed to Takeshi Yamazaki. The series launched in Japan but has also become popular in the United States. However, some games were never localized, leading to the topic of “Gyakuten Kenji 2,” also known as “Ace Attorney Investigations 2.” 
Unlike its predecessor “Ace Attorney Investigations,” “Ace Attorney Investigations 2” was never released in the United States. Yet, after the sequel was translated, some fans of Ace Attorney consider AAI2 far better. Walkthroughs of the game can be found online as a result of this popularity, allowing for others to understand the story revolving around the main character of this game –– Miles Edgeworth.
For some background, Miles Edgeworth is a prosecutor and rival of the main protagonist of the original “Ace Attorney” games. The morally gray setting within the game challenges Edgeworth but through his his steady development, he works to not rush to results. He joins his friends on multiple cases involving crimes committed by unknown people to convey the main theme of not focusing entirely on the results, but instead making long-lasting changes through continuous effort. The game does a good job of emphasizing this through the characters. 
Katherine Hall, a new character in the game and “Ace Attorney” series, exemplifies the consequences of taking shortcuts, regardless of having good intentions. Being a caring housekeeper who is greatly devoted to her boss and guardian, Jeffrey Master, who was accused and incarcerated for murder, Hall was willing to do anything to prove his innocence. Hall went through with this, despite almost taking someone’s life and facing Miles Edgeworth. Hall’s humanity helps us see how even kind people can make morally gray decisions. Should something have gone differently, the true culprit could have been killed, thus destroying a chance at proving Master’s innocence. 
Despite Hall’s actions leading to trapping the true culprit, the plan to save Master would not have succeeded if it were not for both Miles and his father, Gregory Edgeworth. 
This is not Gregory’s first mention in an Ace Attorney game, and it is great how Takumi takes advantage of past characters to exemplify, despite this case being in the minds of people such as Katherine Hall for years and despite Gregory’s death, the information he obtained would ultimately help Edgeworth solve this case. 
Thus, the moral one can get from this is not just focusing solely on the results, but also appreciating continuous effort due to Gregory and Edgeworth eventually aiding in the true culprit’s arrest. Another character, Sebastian Debeste, would later appreciate this effort.
Sebastian Debeste is important because of his similarities to Miles Edgeworth — both characters focus more on the results, rather than putting in effort to find the truth.
Debeste’s testimonies on who the culprits are in his cases lack various details, demonstrating how he rushes into indicting before processing all the facts. Sebastian is not some evil villain, as his problems are shown to be more relatable when we learn about the harsh treatment he received from his father. 
Debeste’s father is shown not to believe in his son, leading to Edgeworth being the one advising Sebastian. At first, Debeste took shortcuts for his father’s approval, but thanks to Edgeworth, he learns to rely on himself, allowing himself to grow in his thinking. 
This is emphasized when Debeste must face his own father, working side-by-side with Edgeworth, appreciating his way of finding the truth about Debeste’s father and his crimes, some of which would ultimately lead to the creation of a vengeful mastermind. 
The overall theme is expressed in the final case of the game where Edgeworth, thanks to his continuous effort, must face-off against the “Mastermind,” who sought revenge when driven into a corner. The “Mastermind” couldn’t trust the justice system and took the shortcut of instigating murder. He states:
“After all, that’s how the police pull the wool over the eyes of those without power! And that’s why my revenge was necessary!” 
However, these acts ultimately cause the “Mastermind” trouble when he attracts the attention of an assassin who wants him dead. 
Soon after, the ways of the“ Mastermind” are almost accepted by a character who wants revenge as well. However, the theme of appreciating continuous effort over rushing through the results is shown again when revenge is avoided as a result of appreciating the efforts of Miles Edgeworth and those who work with him. Edgeworth is further encouraged to continue as a prosecutor, wanting to steadily stop corruption within each courtroom he takes a part in. 
In essence, “Ace Attorney Investigations 2” does a good job with implementing various characters that tried taking morally ambiguous shortcuts that fell short when losing sight of the importance of continuous effort. This was mainly due to the characters driven by emotions of sadness, anger and disappointment — feelings that are presented in different kinds of people. Thus, the themes aren’t constrained to generic villain characters and can be more relatable to the audience.

Each week, students from 32nd Street Elementary School log onto Zoom for their hip-hop dance course taught by Glorya Kaufman School of Dance students. Starting with a check in to share where students’ energy is at, the class then moves to warm-ups, learning new moves, party dances and researching rhythms and variations of steps. While these classes used to be in person, students on both ends quickly adapted to make Kaufman Connections fun, educational and interactive on an online platform. 
Although the program transitioned online due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Kaufman Connections has the highest number of students participating this spring semester, with almost 300 students enrolled compared to the 274 students last semester. Along with a high number of elementary students participating, there has also been a large increase in USC teachers. 
Founded in 2018 through the Kaufman School of Dance, Kaufman Connections is a community engagement program where Bachelor of Fine Arts students teach dance classes to USC’s performing arts magnet school, 32nd Street Elementary School. Not only does the program bring hip-hop dance instruction to students, but it also focuses on the emotional and mental skills gained through performance and choreography. 
Tiffany Bong, the community engagement director of Kaufman Connections, said dance education is essential in growth and development. Other program objectives include increasing arts accessibility, creating pathways for applying to schools such as Kaufman and supporting the classroom teachers at the 32nd Street Elementary School.  
“We look to give back and help the youth by informing them of new ways of movement, ideas and new ways of expression that they might not always have access to in a regular school system, where they don’t get a chance to dance,” said Emily Carr, a Kaufman Connections teacher and a junior majoring in dance.
“A blessing in the pandemic is we’ve had the highest enrollment ever of USC … teaching artists. They’re the ones that go into schools, into the classroom to teach, and we have pretty much doubled our number of enrolled teaching artists,” Bong said. “I think the students need an outlet — something to do, in a way, to serve the community.”
Bong attributed the increased participation to the lack of social interaction and isolation in many individuals’ lives due to the pandemic. The desire to interact and engage has caused many students to spend more time teaching and taking classes. 
“This has been such a beautiful example about how hip hop and dance can exist in all spaces, even in a Zoom space, and the social exchange is definitely still happening,” Bong said. 
Being creative has been an asset to transitioning smoothly to teaching online, Bong said, adding that the transition to Zoom has been going fairly well. 
“I could not speak more highly of [the teaching artists] in terms of how they took this on with a positive mindset, a will, being able to just grow and adapt to the experience,” Bong said. “I think a benefit is that our current generation of students — they are tech savvy; they’re very tech literate.” 
For Senior Aurora Vaughn, transitioning to online teaching has been challenging, but the rewards have been even greater, she said. As students spend their entire days staring at a screen, they crave interaction, Vaughn said. 
“It’s really, really inspiring to see them show up every day and turn on their cameras and say ‘OK, I’m going to dance now,’ and they chat [with] me and … they want to hear about my day,” Vaughn said. “So those kinds of interactions are the most rewarding ones that, in a way, they didn’t have the ability to be able to do that before.” 
Another benefit of teaching online has been the opportunity to help the students be more involved in social justice. Each classroom learns about the history and culture of Black and Indigenous communities and other communities of color that are rooted in the origin of these dances, Bong said. Additionally, the online format has made it possible to host master class workshops with community hip hop artists. 
“As a collective, Kaufman Connections really strives to use hip hop as a tool to unite and inform and share with the community,” Carr said. 
Bella Allen, a junior majoring in dance, utilizes videos to teach her students about hip-hop culture. Sharing videos to give cultural and historical context regarding hip-hop dance, along with watching hip-hop icons dance, is inspiring for her and her students, according to Allen. 
Allen said that being able to relate to her students in regard to taking online classes all day and Zoom fatigue has been very helpful. 
“The struggles of online learning … helps to really inform how I approach engaging with my students,” Allen said. “It’s very cyclical because it’s all about realizing my own limits as a student and how that mirrors the students at the 32nd Street [Elementary School].”
At the end of the fall semester, the program hosted an online culmination performance for students, teachers and funders. 
“You could just see every student, and everybody was really happy. It was just a really good moment. And I just felt like a proud teacher,” said Eugene Bois, a sophomore majoring in dance who is also a teacher for Kaufman Connections. 
Bong said she hopes the program can steadily grow each year, expand one-grade level each year and build a strong affinity relationship with the school community to provide pathways for dance students interested in a dance career or education. A benefit of virtual learning is the possibility to expand Kaufman Connections outside the Los Angeles area, Allen said. Additionally, Allen said the online format could allow the program to expand arts accessibility to schools located farther away from USC’s campus. 
“I want my kids to come away from this feeling like … they are confident in their bodies and in who they are dancing,” Vaughn said. “There’s so much missing right now, physically in our lives, that if they can come away with some sense of physical awareness and love, then that’s good for me.”

Los Angeles County moved forward to Phase 1B of vaccination rollouts as of March 1, opening eligibility to 16 to 64 year olds employed in childcare, food and agriculture, emergency services and education — including student workers.
This week, USC obtained a supply of more than 2,000 vaccines to distribute to its on-site employees, said Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a student media briefing Thursday. While working through Phase 1B, USC is prioritizing employees who have remained on site, who face higher risk through public-facing positions and who work in close contact with others, according to an email sent to University employees Feb. 22.  
“We were fortunate to get a specific allocation that we were able to provide directly to USC faculty and staff this week,” Van Orman said. “We don’t know if we’ll get that again or if that will continue, but our priority for vaccination this week has been staff who are working on campus [and] are essential employees.”
Specifically, this prioritizes those working in transportation, environmental services, custodial and housing, Van Orman said. 
Various students have also been notified of their eligibility for the vaccine based on their employment status through the University. However, USC’s supply of vaccines are limited and cannot be guaranteed to be distributed to all eligible employees at the moment, Van Orman said. 
“I think what the challenge is if we look at the list of the people who are employed and even working on site and the number of people versus the number of vaccines, we’re still a long way from being able to offer it to all people working on site,” Van Orman said.  
Although USC’s supply is limited, Van Orman suggested that anyone eligible for the vaccine find sites in L.A. County or an external location. 
“We’re also encouraging people — [because] even if they’re on that priority list, we may not be able to provide it to them and we don’t know when — if they have other opportunities to go ahead and take advantage of those opportunities,” Van Orman said. 
A city run vaccination site will open at the University Park Campus on Tuesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced in a coronavirus briefing Thursday. The city will be sending mobile clinics into areas with vulnerable populations and aims to vaccinate residents 65 and older who cannot leave their homes due to illness or disability, he said.

The NBA missed the point this time. 
Almost four years ago, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem to peacefully protest the injustice done to Black people in this country. 
But, again, that was almost four years ago — and nothing has changed. 
The conversation of what behavior should be exhibited during the national anthem continues to be the focus instead of the actual reason people decide to kneel or rather forgo the playing of the anthem.
During the years, the NBA has found itself on the right side of history, allowing players to express their advocacy with support from their league without fearing consequence.
As fans and activists were proud of the efforts they saw in the NBA bubble, others questioned if this would serve as another distraction to the public. 
Now, we’re months removed from the bubble and back to regular games, and we find ourselves distracted once again. 
The initial reaction some had was to applaud Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, for stopping his team from playing the national anthem before home games. We thought, “Wow, he cares” — a white man with that much power and influence can begin to encourage his other colleagues to join the conversation with action instead of just with their money behind closed doors. 
The NFL should be applauded for its recent contributions, specifically their pledge of $250 million over a 10-year period to “combat systemic racism and support the battle against the ongoing and historic injustices faced by African Americans.”
However, the question lingers: why now? Where was this support four years ago when Kaepernick brought this matter to the NFL’s front door? Kaepernick was blackballed from the sport, and now, the NFL is working to change the negative opinions that have formed when comparing the league to new modern-day slavery. 
The feelings some had about Cuban’s action were short lived as a day later, the NBA stated that every team was required to play the national anthem. Cuban was found clarifying his statement, saying that his organization has no problem playing the anthem at all but that members of the community didn’t feel it fully represented them.
Here we go again on this never-ending cycle.
This is another debate that will last weeks or months and distract us from issues such as racism and discrimination that remain pervasive in this country. 
Why does the discussion on how NBA teams force teams to play the anthem matter?
Whether the anthem is played or not, people are still racist. Someone has immense hatred for the Black players they see dribble a ball across their TV screens. These people only care about Black people’s existence if it’s a talking point about their favorite team winning a game. They would clutch their wallet tightly in fear if a Black man walked into a gas station with a hoodie on. 
I no longer want to waste my time with meaningless discussions that deviate from the task at hand. The anthem isn’t an accurate depiction of the United States. They say this land is free and home of the brave.
There are exclusions on the free part, and this country sees Black people being brave as a threat.
Veterans who risked their lives for the anthem and fought for freedom should not be disrespected. People should stand, kneel or praise whatever they feel is important to them in terms of how they feel about this country.
When some Black people think about this country, they feel numb. They try to do double the work, be as polite as possible and add prestigious things to their resume in hopes for an ounce of respect — and that still is not enough.
Everyone should be just as tired and disgusted with these conversations that distract us from the real issues as Black people. Today we argue about the anthem, again, but we turn a blind eye to the continuous murders of Black people by the police.
These conversations shouldn’t make anyone forget about Breonna Taylor, Trayvon Martin and George Floyd.

In the time since my last publication, the state of Texas saw a historic cold snap and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was allegedly held hostage in Cancún by his daughters against his will. 
The storms that hit Texas have become increasingly politicized, and the media circus in the wake of the senator’s ill-advised tropical vacation have served to distract from the real issues at hand. What happened in Texas was a failure of the electrical grid to meet the demands of its customers, as well as a failure of state and national leaders to effectively come to the aid of their constituents.
Heavy winter storms have caused Texas to reach subzero temperatures and households across the state have been without water, heat or power, causing massive damage. Food supply chains have been disrupted, pipes have burst and coronavirus vaccinations have reached a standstill as Texans all over the state have been affected by the cold weather. To reduce unprecedentedly high demand on the state’s electrical grid, rolling blackouts were initiated to regulate consumption. 
Many notable Republicans, including Texas’ own governor, Greg Abbott, have claimed that the outages were caused by the state’s increased reliance on renewable energy sources, particularly wind power. Abbott seized upon the initial statement released by the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which cited the reason for outages as frozen wind turbines and a limited natural gas supply. While ERCOT later clarified that natural gas shortages were the primary reason for the energy deficit, Abbott took the opportunity to criticize the prospect of a Green New Deal, pointing fingers and condemning Texas’ — albeit extremely limited — reliance on renewable energy. 
His claims are misleading and inherently false, shifting blame away from a disjointed electrical grid and record-low temperatures that have affected transportation and power across all fuel types. While there’s no denying that ice-encrusted blades may have affected the wind turbines’ ability to perform at maximum efficiency, the problem extends beyond just one method of producing power. 
While Texas has invested more in the implementation of solar and wind power plants in recent years, wind energy generates about 20% of electricity for the state, while natural gas supplies some 47% and coal at around 20% of the total energy produced. Contrary to the comments of Republicans, the state is still heavily reliant on fossil fuel energy, both for its own electricity sources and its economy; some of the world’s leading crude oil, natural gas and coal extractors areTexas-based. Abbott, who has collected campaign contributions from the oil and gas industries, pulls significantly more weight in the energy arena than he’s let on, and even has some oversight over ERCOT functions. 
Texas winters are typically mild, meaning that there hasn’t been a need to winterize energy production equipment. This lack of preparedness was evident when pumps froze at nuclear plants, solar panels were blanketed with snow and the equipment for refining fossil fuels simply froze, limiting the amount of energy that was readily available. 
Although storms of this caliber occur infrequently, infrastructure must be prepared to compensate accordingly, and power distribution systems across the country should engage in mandatory weatherization to prepare for emergencies. Despite Abbott’s assertions, technology to run wind farms in icy conditions does exist, however, the weatherization needed to do so was not done in Texas.
Unlike other states, Texas features a deregulated energy market with numerous independent utilities competing in the market, focusing on offering the lowest possible prices instead of building long-term resilience. The Texas power grid, operated by ERCOT, is separated from the other 47 contiguous states and is designed to stay within the state, avoiding interstate federal regulation, meaning Texans were unable to borrow power from other sources. ERCOT doesn’t have the capability to force more capacity online; it can only adjust monetary incentives for privately-owned energy utilities. 
While this typically works well, as Texas has large reserves of both fossil fuels and renewable sources, the system was stressed due to weather and gas shortages and many natural gas power plants were temporarily shut down. With some energy sources down, energy officials severely underestimated the power demand and initiated blackouts to prevent the entire grid’s shutdown. While it’s entirely possible that blackouts still would have occurred had Texas been connected to the federal grid, it could have helped mitigate the stress placed on private energy providers. 
Texas’s outages serve as another reminder of the stress on our energy system caused by more extreme, climate change-driven weather occurrences. From severe blizzards and rampant wildfires to excessive heat waves, anthropogenic climate change only serves to make our weather more drastic. This is compounded by the ever-increasing demands and reliance on the power grid, which is projected to continue growing as populations increase and as we electrify more cars and homes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Rolling blackouts are an effective way to temporarily shut off power in response to an energy shortage. By lessening the power available in a controlled way, energy workers are preventing more widespread outages. 
However, this is not a sustainable long-term solution. Our electricity infrastructure is inadequate — it was designed for fewer people on the grid, and as the Texas snow storms have shown us, it doesn’t have the capacity to anticipate and accommodate extreme weather events that have become commonplace across the United States. Additionally, privately-owned companies and state-regulated monopolies alike are slow to proactively implement change and maintenance that may prevent future weather-related disruptions in the grid.
Building more energy transmission lines will help reduce the reliance on a single one if the connection is somehow disrupted and also helps incorporate more clean sources of power to store energy. While costs to maintain, revamp and expand energy infrastructure are undoubtedly high, the cost of not improving our energy systems is even higher when lives lost and buildings and houses damaged are taken into account. Although every region has its own unique vulnerabilities, an increased emphasis on climate change mitigation strategies in the energy sphere at a local level is more important than ever, as there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. 
Investing in infrastructure will streamline energy production processes, as well as create more resilient distribution systems, generate more equitable accessibility to regular sources of power and make it easier to transition to relying more heavily upon renewables. The situation in Texas should make it clear to policymakers that Americans rely on electricity now more than ever before, and our current system is not anywhere close to where it should be. 
And, obviously, political leaders shouldn’t abandon their freezing constituencies for the warm beaches of Cancún. Despite Abbott’s unfounded accusations, a Green New Deal is still necessary, and it needs to recognize the vulnerability of existing power grids and infrastructures, making sure that there is adequate and ample supply and storage that can withstand the weather.

Happy Women’s History Month. March is for honoring all of the girls, women and femmes in your life! As a curation of iconic songs by ladies that have shaped and continue to redefine music, this playlist will no doubt leave you dancing with all of your best girlfriends.
Aretha Franklin – “Respect”
All she’s asking for is just a little respect. Aretha Franklin’s “Respect” quickly became the anthem for the women’s rights movement and civil rights movement during the 1960s. So, let’s “take care of business” and pay homage to Ms. Franklin while grooving to this iconic song.
Shania Twain – “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” 
“Let’s go girls” she sings; Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” gives you the sudden urge to let down your hair and dance on top of tables. Twain was right: “The best thing about being a woman is the prerogative to have a little fun.”
Ms. Lauryn Hill – “Doo Wop (That Thing)” 
If this track doesn’t make you involuntarily bop your head while you embark on your fourth walk of the day — just kidding, it definitely did. Ms. Lauryn Hill put hip-hop on the radar with her album “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” So, as the queen said herself, “guys you know you better watch out” because this track is sure to get your hips swaying all day.
Britney Spears – “Circus” 
Did you just watch “Framing Britney Spears” and need the perfect anthem to pump you up while you gather all of your girlfriends to #freeBritney? When you listen to “Circus,” you’ll be reminded of all that Britney Spears has given and continues to give to the world. 
BLACKPINK – “As If It’s Your Last” 
BLACKPINK have certainly made their mark on American mainstream pop. If you’ve been living under a rock, you might not have noticed BLACKPINK blowing up global charts. This Korean girl group will have you dancing “as if it’s your last.”
Dolly Parton – “9 to 5” 
Not only did Dolly Parton sponsor a vaccine for the coronavirus, but she has also received eleven Grammys and earned the title as one of USA Today’s Women of the century. Originally featured in the film “9 to 5,” this track will leave you wanting to lock up your misogynistic boss in girl power’s name.
Robyn – “Call Your Girlfriend” 
Robyn brought forth a new genre of electronic pop during the apex of bubblegum cookie-cutter pop. Influenced by her Swedish roots, this queer icon is sure to make you forget that you’re dancing in your room and not the club.
Ariana Grande ft. Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion – “34+35 (Remix)” 
Joined by Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion, Ariana Grande’s track “34+35” received a revamp with the release of their remixed version. These three female icons are setting the precedent for 21st century pop and will go down in history as the most influential artists of the TikTok era.
Fiona Apple – “Criminal” 
If 2020 was anybody’s year, it was Fiona Apple’s. “Criminal” won a Grammy for best female rock vocal performance, and Apple continues to transform the way that music is created with her latest 2020 release, “Fetch The Bolt Cutters.” She is the blueprint for indie rock.
Rihanna ft. SZA – “Consideration” 
“Will you ever let me, will you ever respect me?” cries Rhianna and SZA on “Consideration,” the first track of “ANTI.” Rhianna, the best-selling digital artist of all time, and SZA, the most nominated woman at the 2018 Grammys on one track? Yes, please! 
Madonna – “Express Yourself” 
Madonna reminds us to never “go for second best.” This female icon holds the title for most No. 1 albums by a female artist. She even holds ten records in the “Guinness Book of World Records” – need I say more?
Billie Eilish – “bad guy” 
Billie Eilish’s “bad guy” won Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the 2020 Grammys. At only 18 years old, Eilish already has five Grammys under her belt and is single handedly redefining what it means to be a contemporary artist.
Lady Gaga, Beyoncé – “Telephone” 
A track that could have only come from two Super Bowl performing queens, “Telephone” is your cue to stop thinking and leave your “head and [your] heart on the dance floor.”
Amy Winehouse – “Back To Black” 
There’s no arguing that Amy Winehouse has left her mark on the music industry. Her album “Back To Black” has won her multiple titles, including Best Female Solo Artist at the BRIT Awards and a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album. So keep your “head high, tears dry,” and dance your sorrows away with this track. 
Janet Jackson – “Nasty” 
One of the most defining artists of all time, Janet Jackson is sure to be remembered for her performance in the “Nasty” music video (choreographed by Paula Abdul). Besides this funky track, Jackson has also earned countless titles including first female to be nominated for Producer of the Year in 1990.
Whitney Houston – “How Will I Know” 
All hail Ms. Whitney Houston. Arguably the most influential pop star all time, Houston was the first woman to be featured on Billboard’s 200 with her #1 album, “Whitney.” “How Will I Know” will remind you of what it’s like to be lovestruck and you’ll no doubt find yourself belting these iconic lyrics along with Houston.

Reading this, it will be obvious that I’ve never created a streaming guide, much less anything themed for March. Instead of a selection consisting entirely of recommendations, take this as your opportunity to wonder what goes on in curating circles to produce some of these dumpster fires of streaming selections. But to make it worth your while, I’ll also include additions that I’m excited or curious about for this pandemic-anniversary month.
As an aside, I don’t care where they are or what I have to buy, but I’ll be marathoning the murderous “Leprechaun” slasher series in a green-food-induced haze this month, maybe stopping after “Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood.”
Netflix
This quintessential streaming service doesn’t seem to take “no, please stop” for an answer. Among a smattering of 50 original titles premiering in March though, there’s quite a range of choices from a British YA figure skating saga, to Michelle Obama making international foods with puppets to another Song Kang K-Drama. I might look out for these as well:
“Bombay Rose” — Mar. 8
This hand-painted 2D film pushes your expectations to witness the best in animation and nothing less. Gitanjali Rao focuses her story on three intertwining stories connected by a red rose: love across religions, across genders and across the boundaries of celebrity and reality. 
“Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal” — Mar. 17
Yeah, it’s here. This pseudo-documentary already falls short in that it was not produced by the Hallmark Channel, and is instead a recreation of the parents’ and college administrators’ illegal pursuits based off of FBI wiretaps and played by actors. It is a “Narcos” impersonation of “privilege gone wild” from the minds of Chris Smith of “Fyre” and the producers of “Tiger King” — and it will push absolutely no change forward on resolving inequities in the college admissions process. But, hey, we’re at USC! This is for us, right?
HBO Max
This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for: turn on that free HBO Max subscription since you won’t get anything else, like AirPods, from this school, throw on a gray tracksuit and queue “Gonna Fly Now,” because the Rocky series will be on HBO Max Mar. 6. It is surprisingly one of the more uplifting choices the budding streaming service has to offer, with the finale of the spine-chilling “Allen v. Farrow” and the U.S.-military approved “Godzilla vs. Kong” remake slated for later in the month. But maybe there’s still something for you:
“Speed” — Mar. 13
There’s nothing like an action movie, and there is truly nothing like a Keanu Reeves action movie. Five years before his Neo stint in “The Matrix” and three years after his radical bro role in “Point Break,” “Speed” is the zenith of Reeves’ big-man roles — centering around a bomb plot from a former bomb squad officer that involves a public bus rigged to blow if it slows to under 50 miles per hour. Driving the bus of doom is Sandra Bullock, a great addition to a film that blows stuff up just because it can. 
“Tina” — Mar. 27
Anna Mae Bullock, forced onto a worldwide exploitative stage by her abusive ex-husband Ike Turner, is known more commonly as the music legend, Tina Turner. After her split, the only thing she wanted in the divorce settlements, was that name, Tina. She lost the rights to their recordings and throughout the course of her career, even losing control over her own story. This documentary is the only documentary to be given Tina’s stamp of approval, as the non-chronological narrative reconstructs her superstardom and re-humanizes her, on her own terms. 
“Corpse Bride” — Mar. 1 
Picture this. You finally got that shipment of the white lace bustier you saw and fell in love with on Depop, you’re on a Timmy Chalamet fix and are in for a little nostalgia. The stop-motion musical paranormal film features Danny Elfman music, that terrifying scene with the knife that I refuse to rewatch to this day and can spark discourse between you and your friends on what truly is goth. 
Amazon
“Coming 2 America” — Mar. 5
I don’t have Amazon and once I am able to get off the grid and escape Jeff Bezos’ internet, it will be a day to rejoice. In the meantime, it is worth mentioning that the sequel to Eddie Murphy’s “Coming 2 America,” an idea by USC alumnus Ryan Coogler, will release the first Friday of March. The return to the kingdom of Zamunda is already worth a watch for Murphy and Arsenio Hall’s chemistry, and most of the original cast, including James Earl Jones, Shari Headley, John Amos and the white guy they were forced to put into the movie, will be returning. Joining them will be, among others, Murphy’s daughter Kiki Layne, the impetus for the sequel’s plot. 
Hulu
Hulu is that loveable mixed bag of a friend that still cautions you to not be shocked when they remove or add any number of frivolous movies and shows to their catalog. For some reason, the streaming service is on a Johnny Depp thriller movie bender this March, but there are some lucky gems to check out in the green. 
“Malcolm X”
Possibly a choice in conjunction with the release of “Judas and the Black Messiah” earlier this year, Spike Lee’s arguable magnum opus is available on Hulu after brief stints on other streaming platforms. Even if you’ve watched before, it is an interesting moment in time to watch the evolution of the portrayal of Black revolutionaries on screen — and the industry vehicles behind them. This was the first non-documentary allowed to film in the holy city of Mecca, and features excerpts of Ossie Davis’ oration of Malcolm X’s eulogy that Davis wrote and read at his funeral in 1965. Alongside Denzel Washington’s role is the sanguine Angela Bassett, whose real-life counterpart in Malcolm X’s widow Betty Shabazz gave the portrayal her thumbs up. 
“Sister Aimee” — Mar. 15
If you’re a fan of Los Angeles and its history at its best and worst, Sister Aimee is one to learn about. The film follows the unbelievably popular Pentecostal evangelist who manipulated radio and the real estate boom in L.A. in the 1920-30s to heal those who came to the city feeling lost and alone. She was a sensation in the worst of terms, drawing an incredible media presence with quotes such as “It is the Bible against ‘Mein Kempf.’ It is the Cross against the Swastika. It is God against the antichrist of Japan,” along with stunts such as faking her own kidnapping and death. With this biopic, you can revel in the influence and harm she caused that would hold footing in the city for decades after her passing.
“Young Frankenstein”
I’ve never been ashamed to say that I haven’t seen a movie, until this title was uttered casually in a conversation between me, an old flame and his sister. One of those movies that are guaranteed to give you a full belly laugh, the horror-comedy follows the grandson of Dr. Frankenstein, learning how to cope with the burden of his family name as his destiny inches closer. The late and great Gene Wilder is director Mel Brooks’ muse, the central figure in this satire of all those old black-and-white films that deal with humans, monsters and “Citizen Kane” all at once.
