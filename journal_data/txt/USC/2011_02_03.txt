Though Congress repealed the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, students are still discussing the ramifications and what is left to be done.
The Queer and Ally Student Alliance and School of Social Work Rainbow Alliance Caucus held a panel Thursday discussing the effects and limitations of the repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. About 40 people attended the discussion.

The recently repealed policy prevented gay, lesbian and bisexual soldiers from serving openly in the military.
“Many people think that because ‘don’t ask don’t tell’ has been repealed by Congress it’s over, but actually that’s far from the truth,” said Rainbow Alliance Caucus Treasurer and event organizer Melanie Walker, a graduate student studying social work.
Walker served in the military before coming to USC.
The panel discussed the effects of the repeal and issues that it failed to address.
“Many people in the community think that this is a done deal, and I hate to rain on their parade, but it’s not,” said Tom Carpenter, a former marine captain and current member of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network’s Board of Directors who was on the panel. “We ended up with a skeleton of a bill. In order to get it passed, we had to give up a lot.”
The bill that repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell” lacked an anti-discrimination clause, saying a person cannot discriminate against another person based on sexuality. The bill also lacked a clear timeline for implementation of the repeal, Carpenter said.
Students attending the event said they realized how much they didn’t know about “don’t ask, don’t tell” once it was discussed.
“Learning that people who were dishonorably discharged didn’t have any benefits was really eye-opening, saddening and frustrating,” said Joe Beltran, a graduate student studying education.
Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center, said the panel of experts helped explain aspects of “don’t ask, don’t tell” that weren’t necessarily clear in media coverage.
“It’s important for our students to know that it’s not over yet, and, even though the repeal had been passed, that there are a lot of things that need to be done,” Vigil said.
Kristopher Patrick, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences who is involved with the LGBT resource ,said the panel made the don’t ask don’t tell repeal more clear.
“I never really understood the full extent of how it affected the soldiers because it didn’t directly affect me,” Patrick said.
Carpenter said the guidelines for the military’s plans to ensure the repeal will not affect recruitment, retention and readiness, are due today,` but there are no deadlines for when servicemen will be trained to handle servicemen serving openly.
“We need to keep an eye on them. We need to be vigilant. We need to make sure they’re doing what they say they’re doing, or else we aren’t going to get certification,” Carpenter said.
Peter Renn, an attorney for LGBT and HIV/AIDS civil rights organization Lambda Legal, said that although the absence of a non-discrimination rule could imply that one isn’t necessary, it could become problem.
“There is explicit non-discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, race and natural origin,” Renn said. “The reality is that there are certain groups of people that need it. Enumeration sends a very clear message.”
Carpenter also said leadership in the Pentagon disagreed with the legal and financial distinctions made between gay and straight spouses. One air force general told him that it was “repugnant” to have two classes of citizens in the military to lead.
“Internally, that’s a good sign,” Carpenter said.
Patrick said that the panel made him more interested in the subject and that he wanted to learn more now.
“I have a lot more questions, but I know a lot more about the topic now,” he said. “The panel definitely enlightened me.”

California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakayue said a decision about whether or not the court can rule on the overturn of California’s ban on same-sex marriage could be reached as soon as next week, according to the Los Angeles Times.
In Nov. 2008, California voters passed Proposition 8, which defines marriage as a union strictly between a man and a woman. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court, which is currently hearing the case to repeal Proposition 8, has called upon the California Supreme Court to make the ruling to determine whether citizens can defend a law in court.
A DADT panel discussed issues of spousal benefits for same-sex couples in the military. - Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
Benjamin Lopez, a legislative analyst and lobbyist for the Traditional Values Coalition of California, argued that since California citizens voted Proposition 8 into law it is the duty of the state to uphold the sanctity of marriage, and in the State’s absence the people should inherit that right.
“There is currently a dilemma, where the decision of the people is not being properly ruled in the court,” Lopez said. “Proponents of Proposition 8 and their attorneys have a right to defend Proposition 8 in court if Schwarzenegger and Brown aren’t going to.”
Attorney Theodore B. Olson, a lead lawyer for the repeal of Proposition 8, argued in a letter to the California Supreme Court that the federal law mandates that the state, not the people have the right to defend a law in court.
“It is clear that California law vests the Attorney General — not private litigants — with the authority to represent the State’s interest in litigation,” Olson wrote. “Proceedings would needlessly delay a decision from the 9th Circuit … and intolerably prolong the denial of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.”
Vincent E. Vigil, the director of USC’s LGBT Student Resource Center, believes that the current attempt to repeal Proposition 8 reflects the changing opinions of Californians in regards to same-sex marriage.
The attempt to repeal Proposition 8 has revived the debate over same sex-marriage in the State of California.
“You can clearly see by recent polls that people’s mindsets have changed on same-sex marriage,” Vigil said.
Vigil attributes the changed public opinion to non-profit equality organizations, which have continued to educate the public on same-sex marriage since the passage of Proposition 8.
“Proposition 8 doesn’t incorporate the current mindset of the voters.” Vigil said.
Supporters of Proposition 8 argue that the proposition accurately reflects the views of California voters.
Vigil said he thinks the issue of same-sex marriage is being unfairly utilized as a political tool.
“[Same-sex marriage] is a political issue that conservatives and some liberals are using to get votes, and it’s sad that people’s values and freedoms are in the middle of this political mud slinging,” Vigil said.
Some students, such as Monroe Ekilah, a freshman majoring in computer engineering and computer science, say same-sex couples should be entitled to all the legal benefits of marriage, regardless of personal views.
“I disagree with Proposition 8 because the legal benefits override the morals,” Ekilah said. “I don’t have to agree with [same-sex marriage].”
These leagal beagles can argue and wrangle all they like about man made laws and such but they can never get away from the supreme laws of our creator And you queers why don’t you lot face the fact and call yourselves homosexuals instead of trying to make your lifestyle look good All churches would do good to get back to basic truths too instead of spinning their lies and hypochrasy
Just to be clear, the only polls that count are the ones made by the voters at the ballot box.  in every state where they have been asked to vote on this issue, the voters have said a loud “NO” to gay “marriage.”  And as I recall, the Field polls showed Prop 8 losing a few days before the election.  So, don’t count the voters out.  They do and will continue to support traditional marriage, all across this country.  As far as the question of standing is concerned, it’ll be interesting to see how the court rules, and what the Ninth Circuit does with their decision.
Haven’t heard of Bradley Effect, I guess that people like you just didn’t want to say public that didn’t want gay to marry. Posting on here prove my point. Beside How would you like it if your rights were taken away by a tyrannical majority
The basic rights of the minorities should not be put up for a vote. Everyone is entitled to equal rights under the equal protection clause of the Constitution. If people voted on civil rights in the 1960s, we’d still be a segregated country and African-Americans would still be forced to drink from separate water fountains.
Karen, 52% vs 48% of voters in California is hardly a “loud NO.”  Those numbers also don’t take into consideration how many of those voters were confused or scared because of the misleading propaganda that had been foisted upon them by the outpouring of millions of dollars by the Mormon Church and various bigoted individuals or businesses.  In every court battle thus far, “God’s chosen defenders of marriage” have failed to adequately demonstrate how allowing same-sex partners to marry would harm society in any way, shape, or form.  Study after study shows that these couples are just as devoted, just as ethical, and just as qualified as parents as any other couple.  Their children grow up normal, and in many cases better-adjusted than children of heterosexual parents.  I wish we could apply your same logic here and take away your own women’s “civil rights” that give you the right to vote, own property, and go to school.  Sounds like you didn’t take advantage of the latter one.  If you’re so hellbent on preserving marriage then maybe you should be fighting for legislation that prevents you from ever getting a divorce.
@ Karen Grube – Let’s think about this.  IF the 19th Ammendment was put to a “vote” in 1920 . . . you . . . . yourself . . .  would not have the right to vote.  It was clear most voters were against the women’s right to vote in 1920.  Stop thinking “The people have spoken” because the Bill of Rights speaks louder.
The California High Court is merely about to decide whether or not to hear the question of standing under state law to begin with. If they agree to take up the issue, it will be some time before they rule. Only then will Prop 8 return to the 9th circuit. Then of course we’ll wait for many more months. So, no, we are not on the verge of a Prop 8 repeal.
Technically, your first paragraph implies that the court will be ruling on the overturn of California’s ban on same sex marriage, but in reality, the court – if it choses to engage – will rule on California law as far as “Standing”.
Other than that, outstanding article and great work.!
Dear prop8 proponents, Gerry Brown was elected governor while advocating for the annihilation of 8. Kamala Harris was elected attorney general while advocating for the same thing. Can you connect the dots, idiots?
Don’t tell me whom I may, or may not marry. Its none of your god-damned business!
Bonus points for civil rhetoric, there, “FlexSF”…and for spelling. (Jerry Brown)

USC is working to encourage healthier food options and more sustainable practices while involving the surrounding community, as discussed at a panel Thursday.
The Graduate and Professional Student Senate hosted The Politics of Food on Thursday, discussing the idea of using food grown in the local community.
Bringing in healthier food definitely brings in a healthier community
The panel included Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality; David Sloane, professor from the School of Policy Planning and Development; Anne McKnight, assistant professor of East Asian languages and literatures and comparative citerature; and Florence Nishida, community leader and gardener who has worked on previous projects with McKnight. The discussion was moderated by Garrett Broad, a graduate student studying communication.
Klinger told the audience of about 60 people about the various USC Hospitality policies and programs. He said USC wants to utilize tray-less dining and local sourcing more on campus. The university already receives some food from local growers, but Klinger wants to get the majority of USC food from local markets.
USC’s Master Plan also includes renovating the University Village to create space for community gardens and local farmers markets.
“As the new area is being planned, using gardens and using the local community will be important,” Klinger said, “There’s a disconnect between the community and USC, and USC needs to embrace the surrounding community and introduce to students smaller, local restaurants and food sources.”
“We have a long way to go, but we have to create a plan to get where we want to be,” Klinger said. “We can’t just get there overnight.”
Nishida spoke about her experience as a gardener and her mission to create local community gardens, especially in the neighborhoods near USC.
“L.A. is the perfect place for us to grow our own food,” Nishida said, “I would love to see a vegetable garden in everyone’s front yard.”
McKnight discussed the role of globalization in the food system and how sustainability affects countries outside of the United States, namely Japan. McKnight teaches two classes at USC that focus on this topic, and students in her class have been working in the community garden near Shrine Place.
“As food is a medium, we can have a new understanding of L.A.’s relationship with food and with the world,” McKnight said.
Some students from McKnight’s class were at the event, saying that they have had experience working in these community gardens.
“We started working once a week in the community garden and we realized how easy it is to build and maintain this garden,” said Kelsey O’Donnell, a senior majoring in global health.
Some students and faculty, though, have already found local food alternatives such as The Mercado on Grand Avenue, which offers local food markets and restaurants, according to Sloane.
These varying perspectives on food, health and sustainability were exactly what GPSS had in mind when creating this event.
“You can’t just look at food from one point of view; you really have to look at food holistically, as it affects more than one discipline and industry,” Sloane said.
How about getting a Fresh & Easy store for the area. They are catching on fast.
I’ll give F&E credit for carrying cheap organics on their shelves, but most of them aren’t grown/sourced locally…which really defeats the purpose of eating sustainably, to be honest.
I’m down for finding business and development models that’ll bring fresh, inexpensive, locally-grown/sourced produce available for both students and members of the community without continuing the growing trend of gentrification around the UPC. (: It looks like the Master Plan is on track to do that: let’s see how it’ll be implemented!

Last weekend, the USC women’s swimming and diving team fell short in road contests against California and Stanford. A week later, the USC men’s team tries to topple the same two Northern California powerhouses.
The No. 8 Trojans (6-1) will take on No. 1 Cal (2-0) on Friday at 5 p.m. and No. 2 Stanford (4-0) on Saturday at 1 p.m.
While the Women of Troy faced disheartening losses at the hands of these top teams, USC coach Dave Salo noted that the men’s team took a lesson from those losses.
“We lost too many close battles last week, and we have made our men aware of that weakness so they don’t repeat the same mistake,” Salo said.
Salo certainly is not underestimating the power that these two teams bring to the table and he has emphasized effort in the days leading up to the team’s weekend slate.
“We will have our hands full this weekend, so our primary goal is to race hard and try to win the close races,” he said. “The Stanford meet meet might be a better matchup for us if we have a chance to win.”
Despite the fierce competition that both rival teams are expected to bring to the table, the men’s team remains hopeful that it will pull out a victory against at least one of these teams.
“We will focus the men on racing hard and try to take as many individual wins as we can against two of the best teams in the country,” Salo said.
Freshman Vlad Morozov, along with All-American swimmers sophomore Clement LeFert and junior Patrick White, will lead the Trojans this weekend.
Though these dual meets against the Golden Bears and the Cardinal are traditionally important to the team, the Trojans also have an eye to the future.
“We try to take dual meets not so big because we are thinking about the NCAAs and the Pac-10s,” Morozov said.

The No. 2 USC men’s tennis team welcomes an old friend Saturday in San Diego coach Brett Masi.
Serving as an assistant for the Trojans from 2005-2009, Masi has since taken over as coach of the Toreros and is in the midst of leading the program’s resurgence
Strong play· Freshman Emilio Gomez, who earned Pac-10 Player of the Week, looks to keep his undefeated record intact against San Diego. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
“This match will be really special,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “There’s only one way to treat a former family member, and that’s to beat them.”
Smith is not the only one who views this match with particular interest.
Many upperclassmen, including senior Jaak Poldma and juniors Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen, were coached by Masi and are anxiously anticipating his return.
“It’s definitely going to be a tough match because [Masi] knows all of our games,” Nguyen said. “We’ve got to be focused, and treat this as if it were a match against Cal or UCLA.”
No. 47 Toreros (3-1) are coming off split matches at last weekend’s ITA’s Kickoff Weekend in Knoxville, Tenn.
They lost to No. 3 Tennessee 6-1, but responded with a win  last week against No. 60 South Carolina 7-0.
To prepare for San Diego, the Trojans (5-0) are looking to continue to focus on their singles play and aim to be more consistent.
So far, the team has played solidly in the singles department, but is still trying to shake things up and find what works for doubles.
“We have two solid doubles teams, but we’d like to win 3-0,” Johnson said. “That comes with more practice and more communication. We need to find the combinations that work best, and our doubles will be just as good as they have been in the past.”
Smith likes the way the current matchups look, even though he is  unsure if he will stick with them down the stretch.
“I feel really good about doubles now that Steve’s healthy,” Smith said. “We have older and younger pairings, and I like our leadership.”
That leadership is eased by the strong play of the freshman class, including newcomer Emilio Gomez, who was named Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Nguyen, who played doubles last season with sophomore J.T. Sundling, and now plays alongside Gomez, is confident that this communication and comfort will come as the season progresses.
USC hosts the Toreros Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium.

Rivalry games always carry a little extra weight.
And when that rival is 18-2, ranked No. 9 in the country and you have struggled of late, the game takes on even more significance.
That’s the situation facing the USC women’s basketball team, which split a pair of home games last week to remain in a tie for third place in the Pac-10 conference.

“UCLA is going to be a really important game for us to go into the rest of the season,” said freshman forward Cassie Harberts. “In most of [our losses] we beat ourselves which is why we’ve been stumbling a bit.”
In the first meeting between the two teams, UCLA’s suffocating defense held the Women of Troy to just 28 percent shooting.
Not only did USC struggle to score, but it also committed 20 turnovers in the 61-42 loss at Pauley Pavilion.
The Bruins (18-2, 8-1) held leading scorer junior guard Briana Gilbreath without a field goal in a dominating performance that USC players described as a learning experience.
“We watched film [of that game], and we weren’t penetrating,” said senior center Kari LaPlante. “We need to stop settling for jump shots and get to the basket.”
That task is easier said than done against the athletic Bruins team, which has been defined by its defense.
LaPlante said success would ultimately come down to execution.
“We just need to slow it down,” she said. “When we get going too fast is when their athleticism helps them. We need to take our time and execute.”
As strong as they are defensively, the Bruins can put up points too.
Senior guard Darxia Morris and junior forward Jasmine Dixon lead the team in scoring with 12.5 and 12.1 points, respectively.
The most dangerous player for UCLA might be sophomore guard/forward Markel Walker, whose size and ball handling ability causes consistent problems for opposing defenses.
“[Walker] is really versatile,” Harberts said.  “She can play inside or out, but we have a lot of players that can match up with her.”
Not to be outdone, USC also boasts one of the more versatile players in the country in Gilbreath.
The do-everything junior guard finished with 12 points, six rebounds, five assists and a career-high eight steals last weekend against Arizona State.
The Women of Troy will need that kind of production from all their players if they want to split the season series with their crosstown rivals.
“We didn’t do too well the first time around so we’ve been preparing this week and we’re going to come out strong,” LaPlante said.
Tipoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday at the Galen Center.

If you start reading this column expecting something about the holy day of signing, when 18-year-olds finally put years of doodling their signatures in the margin of their Algebra notebooks into practice (or not, in the case of Texas A&M recruit Floyd Raven, whose mom forged his signature on a letter of intent to Ole Miss), continue reading, but flip the switch.
I’m here to talk about a situation much more important than where De’Anthony Thomas is going to get paid (in scholarship money, of course) to play football.
This is an epidemic that is sweeping the Pac-10, and a problem that is taking ahold of USC’s basketball team.
It can’t be cured by a simple shot, but hours of therapy consisting of many shots should start to clear the system.
Yes, I’m talking about free throws.  The one shot in basketball that remains constant no matter the situation.
Five seconds left in the game, down two points, drive to the hoop and get hacked?
Step behind a line 15 feet from the middle of the basket, stand there, gather yourself and the ball and shoot a shot with nobody guarding you. Repeat.
Get fouled shooting a jumper six minutes into the game and the score 10-10, what do you do?
Same thing.
What is amazing is that these situations never change.
There are a thousand ways to shoot the same jump shot depending on the situation, but the act of shooting a free throw remains constant throughout all levels of basketball.
Anyone who has followed USC basketball over the last few years knows the one place that USC fans are most scared of is the free-throw line.
In 2007, then-sophomore guard Daniel Hackett stood at the line with two free throws to win the game with five seconds left against No. 2 Memphis at Madison Square Garden.
He made the first free throw to tie it, but missed the second, and eventually the Trojans lost in overtime.
There are countless other times when Trojan fans cringed at the sight of the charity stripe. But this year it’s worse than ever.
This season, the Trojans are shooting a dismal 64.5 percent from the line as a team.
They are ninth in the Pac-10 in free throw percentage and 292nd, out of 345, in the nation.
If they keep this pace up, it will be their worst percentage since they finished the 2004-05 season at a comical 59.8 percent.
Their lack of free throw success was evident in Wednesday night’s loss to the Bruins.
A few times in the second half, the Trojans were trying to make a run, but were stopped by their own ineptitude at the free-throw line.
With nine minutes to go in the game, senior forward Alex Stepheson stepped up to the line with a chance to cut UCLA’s lead to three, only to clang both attempts off the rim.
Then with four minutes left, senior guard Marcus Simmons missed a free throw that would’ve cut UCLA’s lead to nine. Just one minute later, with the chance to get within seven, junior guard Jio Fontan missed a pair that essentially put the nail in USC’s coffin.
With a team that was shooting as poorly from the field as USC was Wednesday, the recipe to stay in the game is to attack the rim and get to the line.
But I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s exactly what the Bruins wanted the Trojans to do.
Given that the Trojans are so defensively minded, they can’t afford to miss opportunities at the free-throw line.
These problems have been evident all year for the Trojans.
Some fans might remember an exhibition game against Point Loma in November in which Stepheson went 3-for-10 from the line and drew sarcastic cheers every time he made a free throw.
“It was funny, but it wasn’t funny,” Stepheson said afterwards.
The fifth-year senior has been a big culprit in contributing to USC’s free throw woes.
He shot 49 percent from the line last year and is shooting just under 49 percent for this season.
He’s said that he’s not distracted during the games while shooting free throws.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill tried to explain Stepheson’s free throw issues in November, but four months later those same issues are still apparent.
“He’s not a great free throw shooter,” O’Neill said after the Point Loma game.
“Tightening up” is an expression many players have used throughout the years to explain the free throw dilemma.
The pressure and fatigue vary from situation to situation in a game, and that’s hard to replicate in practice.
That’s something I can understand, and the mental aspect definitely is a factor when shooting free throws in a game.
Whether poor free throw shooting is preventing USC from becoming an NCAA tournament caliber team is questionable — there are too many other variables at work.
But one thing is for certain: The ability to shoot free throws well has definitely cost USC a few games this year.
It’s about time the Trojans step it up.

A year ago, the USC women’s water polo team notched an NCAA title, bolstered by the legwork of a senior-laden roster. In 2011, it will look to follow a similar path, but with a much younger, more inexperienced group.
Strong debut · While starting for the Women of Troy as a freshman last season, two-meter Patricia Jancso finished second on the team with 45 goals. Jancso looks to build on her success during her sophomore campaign in 2011, which begins Saturday. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Headed by the reigning national coach of the year Jovan Vavic, the No. 2 Women of Troy remain poised for a repeat despite roster turnover, as they return All-Americans senior driver Joelle Bekhazi, senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger and sophomore two-meter Patricia Jancso. The trio accounted for a sizeable portion of last year’s goal count, as Jancso and Bekhazi finished with a combined 101 goals on the season. Dronberger finished with seven during the NCAA Tournament alone.
“At the beginning of the season every year there is great excitement and hope,” Vavic said. “The girls are extremely focused and ready to go.”
Some pundits, however, worry that the loss of highly regarded players, such as All-MPSF-first-team goalie in Tumua Anae and Cutino Award-winning two-meter Kami Craig, could hamper the team’s ability to compete on the national stage. Nonetheless, the Women of Troy have yet to lose the confidence that carried them to a 25-3 season a year ago.
“It’s impossible to replace some of the players we lost,” Vavic said. “You just don’t replace them, but hope that the younger girls are ready to shine. We have some of the best players in the nation in Dronberger and Jancso. The strength of this team will be in our returning players.”
Although largely relying upon their returning players, the Women of Troy have also started to look at some of the newer players, who are preparing to prove their own abilities in the pool. Vavic couples an incoming recruiting class, featuring some of the world’s best talent, with several returners who did not have many playing opportunities in 2010. All will be counted upon to continue the team’s recent track record of success.
“We have some younger players that didn’t play many minutes last year, who want to prove themselves,” Vavic said. “We also have a great recruiting class. We’re looking at Flora Bolonyai from Hungary to make a big impact in the goal, and we also have two girls that came off of the junior national team; [two meter] Madeline Rosenthal and [two-meter] Colleen O’Donnell.”
The team itself is looking forward to being able to prove to the nation that they are still competitive and a team to be reckoned with.
“We’re going to upset a lot of teams,” Bekhazi said. “Our team is young, ready, focused and have some fire in them to unleash. I think we’re going to end up surprising a lot of people.”
The Women of Troy have historically been the team to beat, especially after their NCAA title last year. The team believes that it has the talent and preparation to rise back into the No. 1 spot, as long as injuries are kept at bay.
“The coaches have prepared us well and I think this team is a pretty good team. The preparation and what we did during the whole offseason before is going to help a lot,” Jancso said.
On tap for USC is this weekend’s Stanford Invitational, where they will face Indiana at 10:50 a.m. before an evening clash against crosstown rival UCLA. On Sunday, an early 8 a.m. matchup against Hawai’i is on the horizon, before USC’s opponent in the afternoon game is determined.
But in spite of the team’s arduous slate, it has maintained a focus on the season as a whole.
“We want to go to the NCAA tournament, that’s obviously our goal,” Vavic said. Every single conference game this season is a big game. Our opponents are really dangerous, and we have to be prepared.”
I love the Waterpolo program.. Coach Vavic  is amazing.  The best coach in the country.  The returning players know how to win….the recruiting class has awesome talent.  Come out and see the best program at USC —-WATERPOLO Men’s & Women’s …the proof is in the Nat’l Championships…… & when we do not win it all,
 we are usually in the final two……
.besides the outdoor atmosphere is warm & sunny, the music’s great,, the crowd friendly,
and if you are lucky…..this dude named Tommy will entertain you by dancing to the music,
and doing  a few entertaining dance moves during time outs ….
FIGHT ON!!!

One of the persistent questions surrounding the waves of protest spreading across the Muslim world has been how the United States should respond.
The Obama administration is attempting to balance a number of concerns in crafting its stance on Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen and the increasingly unstable environment in Jordan and Syria.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Among these concerns  are America’s commitment to democracy and human rights, the need to avoid angering any governments that survive, concern for major allies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a desire to maintain a positive  international image.
So far, it seems the administration’s main priority has been to avoid “rocking the boat.” All public statements about the protests, especially those in Egypt, have been  subdued and conservative.
Two major lessons from the last few weeks indicate this is not the appropriate response at this juncture. The first is that there is a clear trend toward popular participation and democracy in the Middle East, a region where a justifiably discontent population will not submit to the rule of a few autocrats for much longer.
The second lesson is that half-measures are bound to fail. Dictators in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Jordan have all made small concessions that did not placate their detractors, who will be stopped only by either a resignation or a terrible show of force, á  la Tiananmen.
There is only one way for the United States and its allies  to come out ahead in this situation: They must stay ahead of the trend.
The protests in North Africa and the Middle East are not about America. Some people have said  this is a reason for Obama to stay quiet, but there is a way to speak out without becoming the center of the storm.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan did it, publicly calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down to preserve his legacy. As a result, when Mubarak finally leaves, Egypt’s new government will likely be friendly to Turkey and see Erdogan as an ally.
Obama could do the same thing, and it would make him massively more popular on the Egyptian streets. Though Obama has finally called for a transition of power, it is unclear why Obama did not assume leadership on such a critical international issue.
It is beginning to appear that Obama’s late reaction to changing events on the ground in Egypt and elsewhere is reflective of an ironically characteristic fault of his administration: a failure to capitalize on moments of change.
Obama entered office promising change, and he has largely delivered. His healthcare reform bill was considered one of the most important pieces of legislation in decades by supporters and opponents alike. The balance of power between Wall Street and Washington has been altered significantly. The war in Iraq is over, and the one in Afghanistan is making gradual progress.
Dr. William Bridges, author of Managing Transition, notes, “When a business or industry is going through a profound transformation — and there is hardly one that is not doing so today — competition blinds people to the real challenge, which is capitalizing on that change.”
If there is one systemic problem with the Obama administration so far, it has been its failure to heed Bridges’ advice.
All too often, it seems that the President is covering his tracks instead of boldly embracing trends.
Egypt’s budding revolution seems to be another example of this type of failure. The United States could frame this as a victory for all of the ideals we claim to hold, celebrate it, then use our support for Egypt’s protest movement to strengthen international perceptions of our government and ease relations with Arab countries after they transition to democracy.
Instead, we are left playing catch-up again, and will be sure to pay the price for it down the road.

The only way for the people of the Middle East (all of Islam for that matter) to experience true democracy is to free themselves from the shackles of Islam.
Islam and democracy are incompatible and anyone who says Indonesia is an example they are simply showing just how dire Islamic democracies are.
Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Oman, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kirgizstan, etc…
Name one country from this or any list of Islamic dominated countries where one can freely criticize Islam, convert from Islam, proselytize for any other religion, draw pictures of Mohammed, criticize Saudi Arabia, openly practice homosexuality or Judaism, be a free woman with all this implies.
So please don’t blame Egypt’s problems on America. I would bet money that if America could foster true democracy in any Muslim country it would, just as it fostered freedoms and democracy in Germany and Japan after WWII.
Quit blaming their problems on anyone but them and their backwards-looking religion.
Finally, let me say, Mohammed was Islam’s first political leader. He refused to acknowledge a separation of mosque and state as Jesus did (Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s…). Mohammed was a theocratic despot who killed, raped, enslaved and pillaged his way to power and wealth.
This is who Muslims look to for direction, no? Not to America, but to Mohammed and therein lies the tale of the tape.
The reason Obama isn’t “capitalizing” on this “moment of change” is because it would be profoundly stupid to do so.  Every other ally we have in the region (besides Israel, which is the only democracy) would realize that our support and friendship is only temporary, and have no incentive to cooperate with us or uphold our interests.  If we supported uprisings every time they happened in the Middle East, we’d have no friends.  
No president or policy maker would seriously support the overly simplistic ideal set forth in this article.
This is the kind of leadership you  get when there’s a political rookie in the WHite House.

You never know where networking can lead.
For me, it led to a trip on the private plane of one of the country’s most successful entrepreneurs, who I had the opportunity to spend last weekend with at the Safari Club International convention in Reno.
It was there that I learned firsthand that there really is merit to the vast support system USC students are exposed to.
After all, being in the middle of a major economic center, there is no shortage of connections.
USC students take pride in knowing that we have supportive employers — Trojan alumni, USC supporters and those who just feel connected to the university — leading top businesses throughout the region. And we have every right to, but only to a certain extent.
But there is a distinct line between having the necessary connections and actually utilizing them.
Those who suggest that this network of Trojans, and even non-Trojan alumni closely affiliated with USC, are out there waiting to employ us upon graduation based on a one-minute conversation, an affirmative handshake and an exchange of contact information  have taken the meaning entirely out of context.
With the season of on-campus career fairs, workshops and networking events in full swing, many students might feel inclined to wait for opportunities to come to them.
It’s hard to blame them. We pay a lot of money to go to a school where respected alumni come meet with eager young minds.
But that’s no reason to be complacent. In fact, successful alumni are only half of what makes up our beloved supportive networking cast.
The other half consists of proactive students willing to go the extra mile.
Last week, I was assigned to interview an entrepreneur for my “Management of New Enterprises” class. Almost immediately, I thought of Glenn Stearns, founder of Stearns Corporation, a mortgage banking enterprise specializing in financial services.
I had met Stearns, an alumnus of my fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa, once before. Though we exchanged business cards, I didn’t realize how far this encounter would take me.
That is until I decided to follow up. I was convinced that it was a long shot that Stearns would take an hour out of his day for a class project, but I tried anyway.
The next day, I received an e-mail reply: “Stephen, you are more than welcome to fly up to a convention with me on my plane tomorrow morning.”
I wasn’t about to pass up this opportunity. I packed my bags, and within hours I was aboard a G5, headed for Reno with the man himself.
Although at the time I didn’t know what I was getting myself into, I now know it was one of the smartest decisions I’ve ever made. I went the extra mile to reach out to Glenn, and it paid off.
That weekend, I spent breakfast, lunch, dinner and late-night chats with Stearns. He could have been at other places. He could have been hanging out with his good pal John Elway, or striking up a conversation with Sarah Palin, whom he briefly met that weekend at the convention.
Instead, Glenn was mentoring me, giving me his full attention. From a hard-nosed kid who grew up in a rough side of Maryland, to a rebellious teenager who snuck into the Oscar after parties, to a hard-nosed and rebellious entrepreneur who grew up to be the owner of the second largest independent corporation in the nation, Glenn had just as much fun telling the stories as I had listening to them.
More importantly, he treated me  as a friend rather than as an interviewer or potential intern. And I viewed Glenn more as a trusted mentor than an on-campus recruiter who you have to sell your one-minute pitch to and hope for the best.
Glenn is not an alumnus of USC, but he is still part of the intricate support system that we all cherish, as he occasionally does speaking engagements at the business school on campus and even employs fellow Trojans in his 50 offices across the country.
It’s amazing that such prominent individuals want to take students under their wing, if given the chance to.
It’s amazing where one business card can take you — but only if you put it to use.

I concur with Bromangasaurus Rex to the nth degree!
You’re so fly like a G6
USC likes to tout its reputation for “connections” and the “Trojan family.” But as recent graduate, it’s nowhere near as amicable among the contemporaneous graduates/students versus old school Trojans; because old school Trojans attended when SC wasn’t an academically prestigious/competitve school. The admit rate was as bad as UC Riverside’s, perhaps worse; and back then, the adage of “it’s all who you know, not what you know” was status quo. We’re immersed in a culture of ugly competition via acting cutthroat and manifesting our inferiority complex by worrying about who got what grade in which class, or who gained an intern/offer from which prestigious firm, etc. Over the last few summers, as a USC undergrad, I remember fellow students flaunting pics of themselves in offices of Big 4 firms in downtown LA posted on their Facebook pages. 
It’s all good.
RCL – You sound awfully bitter for someone your age.  Someone must have promised you a rose garden and all you are able to see are the thorns.  Perhaps if you change your attitude, you might get the breaks you are so desperately seeking.  Just sayin.

Quietly tucked behind Chano’s Drive-In on Flower street lies the Graduate Fine Arts Building, an off-campus extension of the Roski School of Fine Arts.
And although the structure remains relatively unassuming to bystanders, it is a haven for art lovers; housing a plethora of media and services that extend to more than just its students and faculty.
“It is a space for grad students and alumni to come and work,” said Roski lab technician Morgan Cuppet-Michelsen. “But when we bring in outside artists into the school, it is also where students can begin to develop relationships with these artists.”
For outside and emerging artists, such as Otis College of Art and Design graduates Nathan Hess and Kelly Akashi, the few galleries located in the Graduate Fine Arts Building, particularly 3001 Gallery and the newly installed STATION, are exciting platforms for them to showcase their work.
Currently, both Hess and Akashi have ongoing installations at these galleries.
Hess’ exhibit, “Modified Body,” highlights the disfigurement of dog skulls through the use of different mediums such as sculpture and inkjet prints. The exhibit can be seen at STATION, which opened this past summer.
Hess’ vision goes beyond just altered perceptions of animal skulls. The exhibit strives for a deeper understanding of the viewer’s relationship with technology, as well as the changes in modes of production upon entering an unforeseeable era.
“As we attempt to enter an information age, labor, both manual and intellectual, is undergoing a cultural value shift. I’m inspired by luddism, but I am absolutely a futurist,” Hess said. “My question is: What craft does the craftsman pick up when his trade becomes obsolete?”
The minimalist nature of the installation leaves a more powerful impression for each selected piece and more room for Hess’ message to be conveyed.
“The prints and sculpture that I’m exhibiting are physical products, but the real material of this project is data,” Hess said.
In conjunction, Akashi’s exhibit, “Silver Strand,” featured at 3001 Gallery, also located in the Graduate Fine Arts Building, showcases a series of inkjet drawings that spotlights Southern Californian architecture.
Akashi’s awareness of the architectural enclaves she has encountered in the city is evident through the clean and structural lines she incorporates in the designs.
According to Akashi, the subject matter in the work is inspired by the residential community in Southern California, which contains some extreme examples of mixed architecture.
“I wanted to see if, through translating the architectural elements into different mediums, I could define this pastiche as a style unto itself,” Akashi said.
In addition to the drawings, Akashi’s placement of a stark white cylindrical sculpture protruding out from a flat wall adds an unexpected finishing touch to her quirky installment.
“This exhibition is not trying to fit into any single niche or genre,” Akashi said. “This is not intended as an attempt to be ambiguous, but rather to be something familiar yet complicated. Simplicity is a construct.”
Despite being two distinct and separate installations, Hess’ and Akashi’s conceptualized exhibits  complement each other.
“Both of our projects are dealing quite directly with mass-customization, but of course in different ways,” Hess said.
Cuppet-Michelsen agrees, adding that the two installations share a commonality.
“The exhibits look like they can be related to each other,” Cuppet-Michelsen said. “They’re both on facades, and customizing your environment and developing your style from sourcing.”
For Hess, having the ability to display his art in one of the galleries has been a worthwhile experience.
“As an emerging artist I really appreciate this sort of academic ‘off-space’ because it was both a manageable task to fill it, and well-managed in general,” Hess said.
Although the exhibits exude a minimalism and starkness that might be mistaken for simplicity, these young artists contain a vision that is anything but simple.
The installations will run until Feb. 16 and both artists will hold a moderated discussion on their collections with a reception at the Graduate Fine Arts Building on Wednesday at 6 p.m.

Protesters in Maghreb and the Middle East have used Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, along with other tools, to spread their messages and stage massive rallies.
Their actions have further legitimated the organizational and communicative power of social media.
Sadly, the protests have also shown how far the world still needs to come to achieve Internet freedom.
In response to the use of social media, the Egyptian government cut off the Internet, shutting down all major Egyptian ISP and mobile phone providers, cutting the Egyptian people off from sites like Twitter, e-mail accounts and mobile communication.
It’s an intensely shocking and radical move, perpetrated by a dictator trying to subdue a powerful opposition to his reign.
But what is more frightening is how easily it could happen in the rest of the world, particularly the United States.
How is that possible?
Egypt is a military dictatorship, that is actively trying to cut off any form of communication that opposition groups might use.
So how could that same thing happen here in the United States?
The exactly same way it happened in Egypt: the kill switch.
After failing in December, the proposed legislation is back in Congress.
Championed by Connecticut Democrat Senator Joseph Lieberman, along with Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins, the bill would not allow the president to exercise the exact kind of Internet shut-off that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak performed, but it still creates a similar scenario.
The current President could shut down Internet connectivity with “critical infrastructure” as well as parts of the private sector in the face of an imminent threat.
These terms are not clearly defined, leaving them open for interpretation from the government.
That basically means anything could be shut down if there is a “threat” against it.
Clearly, this is a terrible idea.
Yes, cybersecurity is an important topic, and greater security measures for national infrastructure are necessary, but this proposed legislature is more or less taking a chainsaw to what would be a very acute problem.
Not only is the kill switch proposal a bad bill, but it would also be an ineffective bill if passed.
It fails to take into account just how adept people, especially Americans, are at accessing the Internet and using technology.
In Egypt, when Mubarak shut down the Internet, the Egyptian people rallied together using modems, foreign ISPs and other ways to reach the outside world, and in some cases, connect to the Web.
Not everyone got through, but many people still found ways to stay connected.
Even with the Internet shut down, guerrilla communication reigned.
If the Egyptians can get around these blocks, imagine what Americans could do.
Would the Internet giants simply sit and let this happen? Would Google do nothing and let itself be shut out?
Would Mark Zuckerberg who, as history and The Social Network taught us, created the website Facemash in one night while drunk, let millions of Facebook users go without a connection?
Unlikely.
And that’s not taking into account all other Internet users in the country.
Whereas a decade ago tech skills might have been exclusive to the Matrix-bred hacker subculture, today’s generation of youth is more than capable of building websites, using proxies and getting around any sort of censor.
The people of this generation are familiar with peer-to-peer sharing, hacking Wi-Fi sources for a greater signal and dozens of other skills that any government cannot begin to predict.
If they want to get their message out on the Internet, they will.
It took Google and Twitter less than a week to launch Speak2Tweet and connect the disconnected Egyptians with the outside world.
Imagine if they dedicated their entire staffs to restoring a cut off United States, with the raw hardware and machines available.
Working with American youth, it would be an unstoppable movement for connection.
Today, the Internet and computers are not tools for a cultural clique, but a mainstream medium of exchange, one that people fight to hold on to. Nearly everyone has embraced it.
Our modern world is an advanced one, increasingly developed by our tech savvy generation.
We helped turn the Internet into the social communication device it is today.
We will find a way to stay connected, no matter what switch is flipped.

Despite bringing to mind a unique first impression due to its title, Don’t Judge a Dick by Its Foreskin by Max Gold, is, unsurprisingly, a book that cannot be judged by its cover or title.
Although it is indeed funny and a little vulgar, Gold’s book, published in 2010, is not the obnoxious, crude and confrontational dialogue one would expect from such a provocative title. Rather, Don’t Judge a Dick by Its Foreskin is essentially a series of speedy vignettes covering everything from God to love, healthcare, guns and revolution.
Big mouth · Rather than talking about its intriguing title, Gold’s book catalogs his opinions on a number of hot-button dilemmas. - Photo courtesy Four Corner Press  
Or, as Gold says in his reluctant intro, “Almost every topic that can ignite a bar brawl.”
Gold’s writing style is humorous, surprisingly thoughtful and only occasionally flippant. He’s also secure and opinionated, which can be a drawback for some readers. Sometimes as though Gold is a horse with its blinders on.
He only sees his way, leaving no room for debate in his dialogue. But his style is also comforting, because at heart, Don’t Judge a Dick by Its Foreskin is not meant to trigger any deep philosophical debates.
The book is simply a man and his opinion. But because Gold delivers his arguments in a non-confrontational yet confident manner, readers are allowed to absorb the information without overexerting their brains or being put off by his specific views.
Gold also manages to cover a ridiculous number of topics. The table of contents divides the book into two acts.
Act I discusses the more vague and universal themes like God, human purpose, consciousness, individualism, ideas, love, free will, religion and race.
The second act moves on to topics more directly relevant to America, like its political system, the Constitution, immigration and the presence of Socialism in the American economy.
Gold spends a chapter discussing God, and although it’s interesting and logical, it doesn’t feel very credible.
What would Gold tell you if you asked him what God was composed of?
“Here’s your answer: Energy.” Universal and simple.
His chapter, “Just A Thought,” explores the hypothetical idea of the Devil using cunning to divide people in the world and ultimately trick them into being unsatisfied with life on earth.
Occasionally, Gold touches upon something truly insightful and unsettling, but wastes the opportunity by writing in a flippant, unadvisedly entertaining manner, without forcing readers to explore the idea in a meaningful way.
In addition to God, he discusses religion as the first form of government, the man-made invention of human purpose and how art has become exploited for advertisement.
He breaks down Jesus’ miracles with the air of a MythBusters host.
But Gold isn’t as cynical as he sounds. He’s fairly optimistic, and although he expresses disappointment in society’s shortcomings, he also believes in the strength of freewill and one’s ability to alleviate a bad situation.
Gold also injects his personal life into the book by revealing that he is a Canadian-turned-American citizen. In “What Makes America Great & Why The Idea Must Prevail,” Gold gives a description of what the American government was intended to be.
He does, however, offer some groan-inducing, almost unbearably fawning praise for the Founding Fathers, which partially deflates his writing.
Gold imparts his opinions about the media and how its controlled by advertising, which is then controlled by holding companies. In addition, the obnoxious mob chanting of ‘USA, USA’ is placed under the microscope.
The book concluded with an encouragement for peaceful revolution, stating that, “A republic founded on freedom has been weakened by its Government.”
Gold’s book is still not particularly memorable. After all, how memorable can a book destined for reading during short trips, like going  to the toilet, be? Don’t Judge a Dick by Its Foreskin won’t ignite a revolution, even if it does surpass what most readers would expect.

A music industry obsessed with pre-teen idols and hollow lyrics seems no place for someone who actually has something to say, but Anika doesn’t mind standing apart from the crowd.
In fact, she wouldn’t have it any other way.
Scott Pollack | Daily Trojan
Annika Henderson of Surrey, better known as Anika, is known for raising the questions that everyone seems intent on avoiding.
“Yang Yang,” for example, speaks of a fictional character with some disturbing images such as the lines Yang Yang rips his women down to the bones/I own I own you so give us a song.”
“I knew [my record] was a project that some people would [think] was rubbish and some people would say ‘This is cool, you’re doing something different,’ and that was the point,” Henderson said. “I didn’t want to make a record where everyone would [say] ‘This is so nice … I can forget about my troubles.’ That was never its point. Its point was to wake people up. It’s been good to see in England … the young people have started to protest again. They’ve forgotten that they can actually say something.”
Stones Throw Records recently signed Anika to its label.
She will play her first show on American soil alongside Peanut Butter Wolf this Friday at the Natural History Museum as part of the museum’s First Fridays concert series.
After being introduced to Geoff Barrow of the bands Portishead and Beak>, Anika found the ideal sound to accompany her writing.
“Before I found Beak> I was trying to use my stuff with a band in Cardiff but they were a bit more of a rock band and it just didn’t really work. They just drowned out any form of my words,” Henderson said. “For me, the words are quite important. You need to find a band where it allows for the words to have their own space, and that is what I like about Beak>.”
Anika quickly began recording and produced an album in less than two weeks. The final result has its share of imperfections, but the rough patches are what make her album so irresistible.
“The reason we [made the album] in such a short time was because we wanted to keep it raw. If we had done it over a year, we would have gone back and tweaked it so much and tried to fit in the box that everyone else tries to fit their music into these days,” Henderson said.
“I think some of the best things in the past have actually been imperfections that make them so good or make them stand out from everything else.”
Anika has long been interested in writing and music, and her recently released, self-titled album is the perfect blend of both.
Her studies in Cardiff, Wales led her to a career in journalism, but she simultaneously continued to pursue her musical passion.
“I’ve written since I was about 15 but I’ve always had a tune in my head … I’ve always thought of [my writing] to go with music,” Anika said.
For many, a chance to tour the world playing music would be an easy decision, but such was not the case for Anika.
Faced with the decision of accepting a dream job in broadcast journalism or taking time off to pursue her musical talents, Anika decided she would focus on music.
“I felt like banging my head against the wall and screaming because it was my ideal job. It was for chief executive of the broadcast sector and I’ve always worked more in broadcast and I just hated the fact that I had just been given two amazing opportunities,” Anika said.
“There’s a saying in England where you wait for half an hour for a bus and then suddenly three come at once. For ages I’ve been working and working and it’s just been fruitless. Suddenly it’s all coming back now and it’s crazy.”
With as pioneering record a record label as Stones Throw backing her, this album is a first step toward in what looks like a promising career.
“[The music has] so much space to grow, this is the very first stage,” Anika said. “It’s still in its infancy. I just want to observe a bit and decide quite exactly where I want to take it … This is by no means the end of it. I want to keep shocking people.”
[…] I recently interviewed Anika, a new member to Stones Throw Records. I really like what she is doing with her music and more importantly her message. I’m hoping to see more good things from her.  Read the Interview Here […]

Former USC quarterback Mitch Mustain, will not face felony charges following his arrest Tuesday on suspicion of selling prescription narcotics, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Mustain, 22, was arrested Tuesday in Van Nuys, Calif. after allegedly selling Adderall to an undercover police officer. County prosecutors now say they will not pursue a felony prosecution because the substance he sold was lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, similar to Adderall but not a controlled substance. As a result, it is not punishable as felony.
Prosecutors, however, could have gone forward with felony charges since Mustain passed off the substance he was selling as a controlled substance, but opted to send the case to the city attorney’s office due to Mustain’s lack of a criminal record.
“Given that Mustain has no record and that this is his first contact with law enforcement, it is appropriate that it be referred to the city attorney’s office for misdemeanor consideration,” officials wrote in an article published by the Times. According to Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office spokesman Frank Mateljan, Mustain could be charged in the case as early as next week.
Mustain has been preparing for the upcoming NFL draft set to take place from April 28-30. Mustain had been on campus at USC to work out in the school’s athletic facilities in preparation for USC’s Pro Day on March 30 – essentially a workout in front of NFL scouts.
Mustain started only one game for the Trojans in his career, a 20-16 home loss to Notre Dame on Nov. 27, after transferring from Arkansas in 2007. As a freshman for the Razorbacks, Mustain had led Arkansas with an 8-0 record as a starter before a fall out with then-Arkansas coach Houston Nutt.
Mustain was one of the most highly recruited high school players in history.
The arrest of Mustain follows the arrest of another former Trojan Everson Griffen, who played for USC from 2007 to 2009. Griffen, now a member of the NFL’s Minnesota Vikings was arrested on Monday on suspicion of felony battery after LAPD had to use a taser to subdue him after a traffic stop near campus. According to prosecutors, Griffen would not face felony charges as well because officers were not injured and Griffen lacked a criminal history.

The USC men’s golf team began their spring campaign with a bang at the Amer Ari Invitational in Waikoloa, Hawaii Wednesday.
The Trojans, ranked 24th nationally, led the 20-team field with an incredible 17 under par score of 271, by far the strongest round the Trojans have hit all year.
Six teams at the invitational are ranked higher than USC, five of which are ranked in the top 10 nationally.
The USC men's golf team is getting better and better.
USC led by a longshot, seven strokes ahead of both No. 5 ranked Georgia Tech and No. 4 ranked Oklahoma State, who tied for second at a 10 under par score of 278.
UCLA, the top-ranked team in the field (second nationally), sat tied for 10th place with a three under par score of 285.
Even though the course is one the Trojans haven’t seen before, the conditions were fair enough that it gave them a chance to play well.
“It was really nice, with no wind. When it isn’t windy it’s a lot easier to play. When it’s calmer, you can really shoot some good scores,” said sophomore Martin Trainer. “The course is surrounded by lava rocks, which are impossible to play off of, so being able to control the ball is very important.”
The team was led by freshman Jeffrey Kang, who shot for a career-best six under par score of 66 to tie for second place overall.
Kang hit for seven birdies and just one bogey, which makes him the top golfer for the Trojans.
Kang had several strong rounds this fall, but this is his best yet.
Finishing just behind Kang was Trainer.
Trainer hit a five under par score of 67 for a fifth place tie. Trainer had four birdies, one bogey and the team’s only eagle.
“I played really well,” Trainer said. “I’m really happy.”
Freshman Ramsey Sahyoun is off to an uncharacteristically strong start with a four under par score of 68 settling him in ninth place, just a few shots off from second place.
Sahyoun had a solid round that included five birdies and a bogey.
Although Sahyoun had his share of both good rounds during the fall campaign, this is his strongest showing so far in his career.
Junior Steve Lim was next, with a strong two under par score of 70 that landed him in a massive 11-way tie for 21st place.
Lim was incredibly consistent, hitting par on every hole until finally shooting two birdies at the end of his round.
Rounding out the Trojan squad is sophomore T.J. Vogel, who hit for an even par of 72 with two birdies and a double bogey.
“Overall it was a great team effort — we made a lot of birdies. Hopefully we can repeat tomorrow,” Trainer said. “The freshman are really coming around. This performance reinforces our thoughts about how good this team really is.”
The action continues today.

Senior guard Donte Smith thought he had an open fast break layup and an opportunity to close UCLA’s eight-point lead. 
Instead, Smith found himself stumbling to the ground with a little more than four minutes to go.
The Bruins’ Lazeric Jones had chased him down and cleanly rejected the shot.
Jones stuffed the ball back into Smith’s hands, knocking Smith off-balance and sending him hurtling toward the hardwood.
That’s the type of night it was for USC and its guards as they fell 64-50 to crosstown rival UCLA (15-7, 7-3).
USC's men basketball had a tough time, but hopefully the next time around it will be better.
Despite 32 combined points from junior forward Nikola Vucevic and senior forward Alex Stepheson, the Bruins controlled the game throughout.
While Vucevic and Stepheson had success in the post, the Trojans had not perimeter game.
The Trojans’ (12-11, 4-6) starting guards managed only seven points.
USC’s second-leading scorer, junior guard Jio Fontan, was held scoreless for the second time in three games.
He had not been previously held scoreless in his college career.
USC managed only 15 second half points and didn’t have a single perimeter point in the final 25 minutes of play.
As a team, the Trojans made only four jump shots in the game.
“We only had five turnovers,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “But we didn’t make enough [shots] and they made them.”
As a team, the Bruins shot 48 percent while, on the opposite end of the spectrum, USC made only seven field goals in the second half, shooting 30 percent after halftime.
USC showed some life at the end of the first half, finishing on a 9-2 run, punctuated by a Maurice Jones drive and dish to Vucevic for an emphatic slam just before the first half buzzer expired. The run trimmed the lead down to a one-point at halftime after the Bruins had led by nine.
However, Vucevic scored only six of his game-high 18 in the second half.
Just like the first crosstown showdown this season, UCLA entered on a hot streak having won five of six.
But unlike last month’s game, the Bruins assured themselves a victory by jumping out to an early lead with a 12-4 run after Stepheson scored the first two points of the game. UCLA would not trail again.
Joshua Smith came off the bench to lead UCLA with 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting. He also collected six rebounds.
“Josh gave us big minutes off the bench and also provided us great offense,” said UCLA coach Ben Howland. “We’re starting to see glimpses of what he’s capable of.”
The Trojans have a week to lick their wounds before hosting the Oregon schools.
“We have to approach it now like it’s an eight-game season going into the conference tournament,” O’Neill said.
The Trojans eight-game season will begin next Thursday at 8 p.m. when they play Oregon State at the Galen Center.

A week after USC President C.L. Max Nikias sent an email to students warning them of the dangers involved with raves, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission has voted to allow Insomniac, Inc. to host the Electric Daisy Carnival at the Coliseum in June, a year after a minor was killed from an ecstasy overdose at last year’s event.
The two-day electronic music festival is scheduled for June 24 and 25, and is considered as the largest two-day music festival in the country.
The festival will occur almost exactly a year after 15-year-old Sasha Rodriguez’s death from an ecstasy overdose at last year’s event.
Organizers say this year’s event will have increased security measures to ensure that minors will not be allowed into the event. Also, organizers will play anti-drug notices and distribute fliers warning about the dangers of drug use before the beginning of the concert.
This year’s attendance will also be capped at 75,000 patrons per day; last year, the event saw an average 93,000 participants per day. Four hundred LAPD officers will be on-hand, with 100 patrolling inside the Coliseum and 300 patrolling outside.
The Coliseum is under increasing pressure to meet its revenue goals. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Coliseum fell $1.1 million short of its $2.3 million goal for the second half of 2010.

Best known for her risky performance in 1972’s Last Tango in Paris, French actress Maria Schneider passed away this morning at the age of 58 from a long illness. At the age of 19, she appeared in the racy film with Marlon Brando in a role that immediately caught the media’s attention and spurred quite a bit of controversy.
She also appeared in the The Passenger with Jack Nicholson.
In both films, the actress is a woman the men encounter and establish a close, albeit abnormal, relationship with.
Afterwards, Schneider later focused a good number on foreign films, though the buzz from Last Tango in Paris still followed her.
Although she was oftentimes annoyed by the attention from Last Tango in Paris, her role helped take the film world in a new direction and gain a new freedom.

Legendary for their eccentric bluesy music and mysterious relationship history, Jack and Meg White have put an end to their band The White Stripes. On Feb. 2, they posted a letter on their website announcing they would no longer be recording or performing live.
The reasons for the break up were not specifically addressed, but the letter said it was “mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way.”
The White Stripes | Creative Commons
After Jack married Meg and took her last name as his own in 1996, the duo emerged as The White Stripes in 1997. When interviewed during the early stages of their band, they were very quiet about their private life. They tried to convince people that they were siblings instead of a couple to keep the spotlight solely on their music.
Although they divorced in 2000, The White Stripes continued on strong, releasing four albums, White Blood Cells (2001), Elephant (2003), Get Behind Me Satan (2005) and Icky Thump (2007) . To this day, “Seven Nation Army” remains their most successful song.
In 2007, the pair took a break from touring and recording due to Meg’s anxiety issues. Jack took that time to work on side projects, including his bands The Raconteurs and The Dead Weather.
Seeing that they have been on such a lengthy break, their break up is no surprise.
Leaving their fans on a positive note, they concluded their letter by saying “The White Stripes belong to you now and you can do with it whatever you want. The beauty of art and music is that it can last forever if people want it to.”
