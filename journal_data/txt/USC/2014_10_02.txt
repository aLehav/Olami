The USC Center on Public Diplomacy held a discussion Thursday night in Wallis Annenberg Hall that focused on the use of soft power in world negotiations. The event, “Does Soft Power Really Matter?” was moderated by BBC host/presenter Ritula Shah as part of a larger series broadcast to both British and international viewers.
Soft power, hard choices · Panelists including Jay Wang, director of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy debated the role of soft power in international relations at a discussion on Thursday night. – Linda Hsu | Daily Trojan
The event featured a panel of experts in the fields of global studies and public diplomacy who assessed the significance of soft power in various facets of international relations.
The term “soft power” was coined by Joseph Nye, a political scientist and former dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
“Soft power is the ability to get things you want through attraction rather than coercion or payment,” Nye said in a previously recorded interview with Shah that was played at the event.
Though globalization has made nation-states more interconnected than ever, recent events like Russia’s annexation of Crimea, territorial conflict in the South China Sea and enduring animosity in the Middle East serve as reminders that hostility — in the form of hard power — continues to impede diplomatic interactions on the modern world stage.
“Hard power and soft power are historical constants,” said Jay Wang, Director of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. “What’s new is that in the contemporary times, because of the information environment that we’re living in, the powers are so diffused that there are so many different actors. In order to accomplish peaceful, productive relationships in the context of the global economy, we do rely more on soft power tools to establish that. Even though we are witnessing some hard power moments, in general soft power does matter — and matters more.”
Political scientist and professor of public policy at Pepperdine University Robert Kaufman, though, argued that this outlook is overreaching.
“Soft power has its place, but you have to make a reasonable distinction between dealing with democratic regimes in the democratic zone of peace, or regimes that are revolutionary, authoritarian and expansionist,” Kaufman said. “In the latter category, the Obama administration has vastly overrated the importance of soft power at the neglect of hard power.”
Yet P.J. Crowley, Global Communication Fellow at George Washington University, conceded that hard power is not everything.
“You can see today hard power also has its limits. We no longer, thankfully, fight wars to a total surrender. All wars now are wars of choice,” Crowley said. “You have the employment of hard power, but in determining who has the advantage or disadvantage, it’s accompanied by a significant campaign of soft power.”
Kaufman later asserted that soft power can be and has been beneficial, but only when the circumstances are convenient.
“The United States and weak countries, or countries not in the mainstream of geopolitics, have historically always advocated soft power because they’ve had the luxury to do it,” he said.
On this note, Shah cited the temperate relationships between Argentina and Brazil and among the United States and its bordering neighbors.
“Let me give you the contrast,” Kaufman said. “If Israel relied on soft power, it’d be gone in 30 minutes. The ability of a country to rely on soft power depends on your neighborhood, your enemies and the situation you’re in. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it’s a death sentence.”
Olga Oliker, associate director of the nonprofit global policy think tank RAND Corporation, cited the negative effects of soft power.
“Nothing Russia is doing now would have happened if it hadn’t started off with a very effective soft power campaign,” she said.
Technology fuels this negative soft power influence as well.
“Just because it’s soft doesn’t mean it’s nice,” Oliker said. “Soft power isn’t benevolent power; soft power is an effort to attract. ISIS uses soft power. This is where I think the Information Age is very important. They reach out to people around the world through the Internet, and that’s soft power.”
Students at the event said that the discussion highlighted a shift in the study of international relations.
“Soft power is the bright side of international relations, with a focus less on war, political maneuvering, or deceptive diplomacy but rather the power of cultural identity and ideals that either bind or separate countries and nations,” said Kenneth Lee, a freshman majoring in international relations (global economy). “Accordingly, globalization makes soft power critical.”
Others enjoyed the format of the event.
“I think the way this presentation was formatted was really cool because we got to see all these great thinkers discuss live instead of just reading a report or watching a program,” said Nimarta Singh, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global economy).

The Office of Equity and Diversity announced the launch of the Sexual Misconduct Prevention Task Force, a group consisting of five committees to address the issue of campus sexual assault and gender violence on Wednesday.
New home · The Center for Women and Men plans to relocate to the Engemann Student Health Center (above) in October 2014. – Razan al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
The launch, announced by email, follows a March letter to the USC community from Ainsley Carry, vice provost for student affairs.
“Student safety is our highest priority, and USC wants all members of our community to have an environment free from sexual assault and misconduct,” Carry said in his March 25 letter. “We desire to enhance communication to achieve this priority.”
Though it is headed by Jody Shipper, Title IX Coordinator and executive director of the Office of Equity and Diversity and Ekta Kumar, director of the Center for Women and Men, the task force will be mainly student-run. Title IX is a federal provision barring gender discrimination in an education environment.
The five committees of the task force are student programming; clinical and advocacy procedures; communications; sexual assault policy; and inclusivity, LGBTQ and gender-based misconduct.
Ilene Rosenstein, director of student counseling services, will lead the clinical and advocacy procedures committee; Lynette Merriman, associate provost for support and advocacy, will lead the communications committee; Kelby Harrison, director of the LGBTQ Center, will lead the inclusivity, LGBTQ and gender-based misconduct committee; and Shipper will lead the sexual assault policy committee.
Kumar will coordinate the student programming committee in addition to managing the task force as a whole. She said that she has already received over 20 emails expressing interest in the committee, and that other coordinators she has spoken to have received similar levels of student interest.
“We’re getting a lot of student interest in it, which is good,” Kumar said.
“I think the whole point of the task force is to get students involved in this kind of work, and for their voices to be heard,” Kumar said. “And so that is why we separated it in five areas, to have a comprehensive approach.”
Though planning is its early stages, the five committees will collaborate with each other in managing and implementing student-led initiatives.
“Everyone who’s leading a committee, all of us will be touching base with one another, so there will be communication with different people who are running the subcommittees,” Kumar said.
Last week, USC hosted a national conference of university leaders to discuss issues related to sexual misconduct. Thirty-five universities sent representatives to the conference to discuss issues of prevention, bystander awareness education, education programs and legislation regarding college sexual assaults.
Such legislation includes the yes means yes law. California became the first state in the nation this week to institute an affirmative definition of consent. SB 967, popularly known as the yes means yes law, requires that people who engage in sexual activity give affirmative, unambiguous and voluntary consent to sexual acts. All California universities who use financial aid funding from the state must conform to the law.
Kumar said input from the conference encouraged the development of the task force.
“It reinforced the fact that we’re doing this and helped us recognize that we’re ahead of the wave,” she said.

Spaceship Earth Grants, a crowd-funded scholarship program, co-founded by USC alumnus Shubham Garg, is the first to offer scholarships for space travel with the aim of sending private citizens to space.
Garg’s experience working with students and professionals at USC prepared him for his work at Spaceship Earth Grants. Garg is a 2012 graduate with a master’s degree in astronautical angineering.
“Meeting with professors for my two years at USC was helpful. However, what was more helpful was the culture that USC provided,” Garg said. “I had phenomenal mentors who coached me and was exposed to the culture of international students.”
Applicants to the program must pay a fee of $15 to $90 depending on the relative wealth of the country in which they reside. The application fees, in part, fund the scholarships.
The funds gained from those who have applied for the scholarship from Spaceship Earth Grants are allocated to several areas.
“It’s an opportunity for people to apply to be part of a community that is interested in joining a group of people across the globe who wish to make our planet a better place,” said Leland Melvin, astronaut and president of Spaceship Earth Grants.
Melvin himself has been to space twice as a NASA astronaut. He also participated in missions to the International Space Station.
“The resources are balanced so that some go to STEAM education, organizations working to better our planet and people’s resources for our planet, and the scholarship to space,” Melvin said.
STEAM education refers to the subjects of science, technology, engineering, art and math. According to Melvin, STEAM education makes way for an interdisciplinary approach to space and planet sustainability in science and the humanities.
“If you make it STEAM, not STEM, everyone is included in it. Everyone is involved in making this project work,” Melvin said.
STEM education is the more common reference toward an emphasis in science, technology, engineering and math. By incorporating, STEAM allows for a wider variety of participants to go into space so that the scholarship will not be limited just to those with a science background, Melvin said.
Melvin described travelling to space as an experience that transforms and inspires people.
“When you look down at Earth, you get a sense of peace and serenity,” Melvin said. “It almost brings tears to your eyes to know that all around the planet there is some type of strife going on.”
Melvin said the purpose of Spaceship Earth Grants is to have a member of the public go up to space, have a profound experience and come back down to change the planet into a better place.
“I agree with the idea of sending someone to space for sustainability and the humanity aspect,” said Sierra Drummond, an undeclared freshman. “Realizing that we are just a small part of this universe and having a transformative experience of seeing Earth instead of being within it is how one can realize how special it is to take care of our Earth.”
The scholarship program emphasizes that it looks for members with all different experiences.
“You need your musicians and you need your poets,” Melvin said.
Melvin said it is important to have students with STEAM educational backgrounds solve interdisciplinary problems.
“I like having students working together around the globe to get students working as a team,” Melvin said. “When we built the space station, we were nations that had never spoken to one another outside of modules, and yet, my Russian colleagues began to know what I was about and I knew what they were about. We broke bread together.”
Melvin said that working with Garg has been helpful to the development of the scholarship.
“Working with Shubham [Garg] has been excellent,” Melvin said. “He has been such a great team member. We have people from all over the world and different walks of life and there is a solitary purpose for changing the world that we all have, including Shubham [Garg].”
Melvin said that he hopes going to space will create transformative experiences for potential recipients of the grant.
“We can help change people’s perspectives not only by sending a few to space but by having them come back to inspire others,” Melvin said. “That’s the whole mission. Space transformed me, and I want to help others have the same experience. You’ve got to go up to space.”

On Sept. 30, USC unveiled a new interdisciplinary initiative, Mindful USC, to promote the mental and physical health of USC community members.
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, who co-created the initiative, has helped develop an interdisciplinary approach to mindfulness that is unique to USC’s program.
“We feel like our initiative is more comprehensive than most of the initiatives of other universities because it has a focus on three areas: research, teaching and practice,” Soni said.
The new initiative will feature mindfulness courses, practice groups, research opportunities, faculty workshops, media resources, public programs and special events. The first event will take place on Oct. 22 at 6:30 p.m., and will include a presentation by Chade-Meng Tan, Google’s chief happiness officer, whose official title is the Jolly Good Fellow. He is also the author of Search Inside Yourself, a modern manual for mindfulness.
The free, 5-week workshops will be hosted by the Center for Excellence in Teaching on both the University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus. They will be open to students, faculty and staff and will focus primarily on how to develop personal mindfulness practices.
“[The workshops] are really focused on developing mindfulness practices, self-compassion, and we’re really oriented around the ideas of stress reduction, workplace happiness and innovative and creative learning,” Soni said.
Mindful USC’s Steering Committee is co-chaired by Professor Allen Weiss and Soni. The committee also includes leaders from the Center for Excellence in Teaching, Center for Work and Family Life, Institute for Integrative Health, Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics, Engemann Health Center, Office of Talent Management and the Office of Religious Life. Faculty members from six academic schools are also represented. The Steering Committee is also partnering with Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments to make the program as effective for students as possible.
USG president Andrew Menard views the issue of mental health a critical one on campus.
“It’s important for [students] to make sure not only that they’re doing well in school, but that they’re mentally well and mentally healthy because ultimately what’s going to impact their performance is how healthy they are,” he said.
Menard also acknowledged his own struggles with stress management, which has helped shaped his passion toward providing a better learning environment for students at USC.
“There have been times when I’ve been stressed out, or my friends have been stressed out, and ultimately I think that it’s been a hindrance to our productivity,” Menard said. “I think the sooner that students take a step back and recognize the importance of being mentally well and having this mindful outlook, students are just going to enjoy their lives more.”
Soni hopes to expand the program to have a greater impact on the USC community as a whole.
“The goal really is to start something and see who’s really excited about this. What we really want to do is create a buzz around mindfulness, and hopefully people from different domains and disciplines within the university will come and say they want to be a part of this,” he said.
Students can get more information about the program and sign up for classes on the initiative’s website, mindful.usc.edu.

After opening conference play with a 21-5 win over Pepperdine, the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team will try to spark some home cooking Saturday as it clashes with No. 5 UC Santa Barbara in its first game at Uytengsu Aquatics Center this season.
With their rout over the Waves last week, the 11-2 Trojans began Mountain Pacific Sports Federation competition on the right foot and rebounded from the Kap7 NorCal Classic, where the team suffered its first two losses of the season at the hands of No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal.
Now, the youthful Trojan squad will try to build a winning streak in the early stages of conference play before getting another crack at the rival Bruins and Golden Bears later this month.
Making up one of the youngest Trojan squads in recent memory, the team’s freshmen have quickly adjusted to the collegiate level of play and to the gameplan of 12-time National Coach of the Year Jovan Vavic.
Nearing the midway point of the season, freshman goalies McQuin Baron and Ben Goncharenko have combined for a total 114 saves, while freshmen drivers Matteo Morelli and Grant Stein have tallied 28 and 26 goals so far respectively — only senior driver and captain Kostas Genidounias has netted more shots with a team-high 41 goals on the year. Genidounias believes his first-year teammates have found their niche so far.
“It’s very encouraging and really important for our freshmen to step up,” Genidounias said. “Players like [freshman utility man] James Walters, Grant Stein, Mateo Morelli and [freshman utility man] Mihajlo Milevic — it’s really encouraging to see them play and score and do well on defense because they’ve been here for a month or two and they’re playing like that — wait until you see them in a couple of months or in a couple years.”
These freshmen will be key in pulling off a win over the 8-2 Gauchos. One of UCSB’s two losses came at the hands of USC on the first day of the NorCal Classic last month. The other came to Cal.
The Trojans will, on the defensive end, look to limit Gaucho driver Eric Van de Mortel, who leads the team in scoring with 16 goals this season, and on the offensive end, continue spreading the ball around — 10 different Trojans scored in the team’s victory over Pepperdine, and Vavic has emphasized such ball movement as a key part of the Trojan offense.
“That has been our trademark for the last few years,” Vavic said. “We really want more people to be involved and play freely. This is nothing new for us — if you look back at the last 10 years, we’ve always had more people involved. We’re just continuing to build the same way, and we always encouraged players to be aggressive, and it’s been great.”

I hate Arizona State.
I mean, I really, really, really hate Arizona State.
My animosity toward that university goes back to my freshman year at USC.
Pullin’ me back · Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard has felt the sting of losing to Arizona State twice in his five-year career as a Trojan. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Let’s take a little trip down memory lane. Freshman year, I was still with my high school boyfriend (dumb, I know), who went to Arizona State. Naturally, I jumped at the opportunity to head out for the USC game in Tempe in 2011.
We sat in the sweltering Arizona sun for hours to get early bird tickets to be able to sit in the first couple of rows (Why isn’t it just first-come, first-served at the stadium before the game starts? I don’t know, maybe because it’s Arizona State and they can’t do anything right.)
Except that night they did do something right. They did something right that they hadn’t done since 1999. They beat USC. The Trojans entered that game sporting a 3-0 record and a No. 23 ranking, so I was feeling pretty confident.
Confident enough, in fact, that I decided it would be a good idea to wear my cardinal USC T-shirt smack dab in the middle of Arizona State’s drunk, sweaty sea of gold.
Big mistake.
People screamed at me. People threw things at me. Even Sparky the Sun Devil, ASU’s creepy mascot with a weak mustache, towered over me and tried to intimidate me. It worked. I almost cried.
I also almost cried after USC took its only lead of the game late in the third and went on to cede 22 straight points to lose the game, 43-22. I’m pretty sure there’s something in the air there that just magically lowers everyone’s IQ, and that definitely seemed to be the case with the Trojans in the second half of that game.
One of the only things that kept me from crying was laughing at the whole student section pouring out of the stadium after the game and cheering, “Let’s get wasted!” Jackasses.
For some reason, I decided to go back the next weekend. Call me a glutton for punishment, but it was ASU’s family weekend, so I headed out with his family to watch the Sun Devils take on Oregon State. I had gotten over the last week’s heartbreak and was fully prepared to root for the Sun Devils, wearing a yellow ASU t-shirt and all.
That feeling pretty much went out the window when some student I walked past before the game recognized me from the previous weekend.
“Hey, weren’t you here last weekend?” he screamed. “Take that [expletive] shirt off, that’s disrespectful!”
At that point, I damned ASU football forever.
There’s a special place in my heart for that program. It’s the cold, dark place that also hates “How I Met Your Mother,” Jack Johnson and bacon. Yes, I hate bacon.
I still cringe whenever I meet people who go to Arizona State. And that includes my editor-in-chief’s little brother (Sorry, Euno’s little brother).
So as you can imagine, last year was especially painful for me, as it was for all of you too, I’m sure. Thankfully, I didn’t head out to Tempe again. My ex-boyfriend dropped out anyway (snicker). I actually didn’t even watch the game live.
Instead, I went to a concert in San Diego with my mom, recorded the game and tried to stay off all social media to not have the result spoiled — like that ever works.
I went to bed not knowing the outcome, and I sort of wish I had never woken up. Because when I did, there was that Bleacher Report notification that Kiffin was no more, along with a gloating text from my mom’s best friend, who went to UCLA.
Watching a recording of the game and fast-forwarding through a lot of the breaks and early ASU drives made it difficult for me to gauge exactly what went wrong for USC. All I could tell was that it was embarrassing and that I’m glad that I wasn’t sports editor at that time (shoutout to Nick Selbe and Will Laws).
Thankfully, the Trojans bounced back after their 2011 loss with a 38-17 win over the Sun Devils in 2012, and I predict they will put on a similar performance on Saturday.
For the first time this season, the water seems to be calm surrounding this football team.
The Trojans are coming off a resounding win over Oregon State, and everything seems to be in order.
Redshirt junior wide receiver Victor Blackwell has been skipping all team activities and likely causing some friction with his teammates, but this drama is minor compared to what the Trojans have been dealing with all season.
The Trojans are healthy, redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler is firing on all cylinders, and USC’s rush game bounced back from an atrocious performance at Boston College with a combined 200-yard effort on the ground against Oregon State.
Couple that with the fact that Arizona State is starting a quarterback with only one other career start (last week’s 62-27 loss at home to UCLA), and I’m feeling pretty good about USC’s chances this Saturday.
Maybe my resentment toward the Sun Devils is clouding my vision, but I don’t care.
ASU’s hellish location, weather and demon-like mascot are pretty emblematic. That place is evil.
Fight on and please, please, please Beat the Sun Devils!

So did you cry again when ASU shat on you guys last night?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
You sound like a typical immature, spoiled, judgmental snob that is sheltered by money from reality..  It’s a football game not church!  So basically you called an entire university out because you decided to sit in the student section and they gave you the business.  This happens everywhere and you were naive if you thought it would be peaceful.  Then you got angry because ASU won and then someone called you out for your identity crisis when you went back impersonating an ASU fan the next week..  OMG!  The horror.  My IQ dropped from reading this rubbish.  
Didn’t know the Daily Trojan publishes glorified Facebook posts. All I got out of that was “I’ve visited ASU twice, people were mean to me, so now I hate the entire university.” You’re entitled to your opinion, but you wore a rival school’s shirt in a college student section – what did you possibly expect would happen…?
From myself and everyone at ASU: Fork You.

A lot will be on the line for the 16th-ranked Trojan football team this Saturday, when USC hosts Arizona State in its first Pac-12 South matchup.
Local product Mike Bercovici will get the nod for the Sun Devils at quarterback, as their normal starter, Taylor Kelly, is out for the second straight week with a foot injury.
Last week, Bercovici set ASU football records by attempting 68 passes and completing 42.
Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen sat down with Arizona State’s State Press football reporter, Evan Webeck,  to give Trojan fans a better picture of what to expect from this Sun Devil squad on Saturday afternoon.
 
Daily Trojan: How are the Sun Devils compensating for the loss of quarterback Taylor Kelly? What can we expect from backup Mike Bercovici?
State Press: Well, if everything goes as planned, Bercovici won’t throw the ball 68 times again. Although he didn’t lose the game for ASU, the Sun Devils aren’t going to consistently win when their backup quarterback throws more than twice as many passes as D.J. Foster has yards.
Foster, ASU’s star running back, ran only nine times for 30 yards against UCLA. ASU has to get its running game going if it’s going to keep up with USC.
DT: What areas of weakness did UCLA expose in its 62-27 victory over ASU last week?
SP: Defense. Tackling. Special teams. All areas where we knew there are potential holes, and almost every hole was exposed against UCLA, like only a 35-point loss can do. UCLA was the first real test for ASU’s inexperienced defense, and it showed. Todd Graham blamed it on his players getting too hyped, but the Colorado game hinted potential problems, and they were proven right when the Sun Devils faced a real opponent.
 
DT: The last time anyone scored 62 points at Sun Devil Stadium was last year, when ASU defeated USC, 62-41. How has ASU’s team changed then?
SP: It’s changed a lot, quite frankly. There aren’t any difference makers on the defense anymore, and it’s no longer a point of strength. The offense, however, is still totally capable of hanging 62 on the board, at least when Taylor Kelly is at quarterback. Obviously, Bercovici starting is a pretty big change, too. He’s turnover prone, unlike Kelly, but has a similar skill set otherwise. He’ll have to limit his turnovers in order to make up for the defense’s shortcomings.
DT: Each year, ASU seems to have one outstanding defense player — in 2013 it was Will Sutton and in 2012, Vontaze Burfict. Who is leading the Sun Devil defense this year?
SP: There isn’t really a standout player on the defense. If I had to pick a leader, it would be Damarious Randall, ASU’s redshirt senior field safety. Randall is the most experienced player on a young defense and is a player Graham was counting on to be a leader going into the season.
Generally, he’s met expectations. He’s third in the Pac-12 with 38 tackles and forced a fumble. Graham was asked on Tuesday to evaluate his play thus far, and he said he was pleased but still expects more from Randall.
 
DT: Who will be ASU’s impact player this Saturday?
SP: If it’s not D.J. Foster, ASU probably doesn’t win the game. ASU probably doesn’t win the game, period.
But if Foster for a second straight game isn’t able to get going, ASU won’t be able to put up the points to match USC. The first three games, Foster didn’t have less than 147 rushing yards, to go along with a handful of receptions.
Uncoincidentally, ASU won all three games. He’s the best playmaker ASU has, and possibly the best in the Pac-12. I expected him to step up last week, and he didn’t. But he gets another chance this week.
 
DT: Prediction?
SP: USC 38, ASU 27.

Another Saturday brings another tough conference matchup for the USC football team. The No. 16 Trojans (3-1, 2-0 Pac-12) will host Arizona State, a dangerous squad even without starting quarterback Taylor Kelly, who is out with a foot injury for the next few weeks.
Will I am · Junior defensive end Leonard Williams leads USC with 27 total tackles this season and is tied for the team lead with two sacks. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Sun Devils (3-1, 1-1) take their second straight crack at a Los Angeles team, just over a week after a 62-27 drubbing at the hands of UCLA. Backup quarterback Mike Bercovici looked strong against the Bruins in his first career start but struggled to protect the football as the game went on. The Los Angeles-area native threw for 488 yards and three touchdowns, but two key interceptions denied ASU a chance at an upset win. Still, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian has been impressed by the work that Sun Devils’ head coach Todd Graham has done over the past few seasons.
“He’s done it with discipline,” Sarkisian said of Graham’s success. “There was a time there when people thought of Arizona State as an undisciplined team. [Now] they’re the fewest penalized team in the league. [Graham]’s got his system in place now, and they’ve recruited to those systems. They’re a really talented team.”
Bercovici will face a Trojan secondary that effectively shut down Oregon State’s Sean Mannion last week, holding the Beavers’ highly touted NFL prospect to 123 yards on just 15 completions. But the passing game is not all the USC defense will have to worry about; ASU running back D.J. Foster, thus far the Pac-12’s leading rusher, has racked up 540 yards on an impressive 8.6 yards per carry in four games. The junior also has 207 receiving yards and six total touchdowns on the season. Sarkisian noted the challenge that Foster presents to opposing defenses.
“What I admire about D.J. [Foster] and their system, is that not only do they hand him the ball, they throw him the ball,” Sarkisian said. “They do it a lot of different ways, with a variety of schemes. D.J. [Foster] is a really versatile player, and he’s a tough matchup.”
After giving up 580 total yards to the Bruins, ASU’s defense has had extra time to prepare for USC’s balanced attack. The Trojans will have to get used to this; each of their remaining Pac-12 South opponents will have more than a week to ready themselves. That notwithstanding, USC redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler is focused on football.
“I just focus on what I can control,” Kessler told Trojans Live. “I just block all that out. These guys come out and come ready to work, and I think that showed in the Oregon State game.”
Though ASU has struggled to maintain a viable pass rush without former Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Will Sutton, Kessler still has to stare down safety Damarious Randall, who leads the team with 38 total tackles. Randall has been a bright spot for a young Sun Devil unit that ranks 90th out of 125 FBS teams in scoring defense. Even after last week’s poor effort, Sarkisian feels that the ASU defense is formidable.
“They’re a prideful group,” Sarkisian said. “Coach Graham is a heck of a coach, and he’s a defensive coach. It’s like anything — when you have things to fix, and you have a good coach, you fix them. They’ll be ready to play.”
USC sophomore tailback Justin Davis, who picked up 82 yards on the ground and two total touchdowns last week, aims to exploit this weakness for the second time in his career. Davis broke out for three touchdowns and his first career 100-yard game in last season’s loss to ASU.
“[Last year’s game] is one of those memories that’s going to be in my head for a long time,” Davis told the Los Angeles Times. “Hopefully I can build off of that on Saturday.”
If USC had one area to improve upon after last week’s 35-10 win over Oregon State, it was reducing the 14 penalties the team received over the course of the game. Though acknowledging the issue, Sarkisian downplayed the effect of penalties on the outcome of the game.
“I’ve said this all along, and I don’t mean this in a negative tone: we had three penalties against Boston College and lost,” Sarkisian said. “We had 14 last week and won. Do we like having penalties? No. But there’s a lot of stuff for us to focus on that really matter in winning and losing.”
The Trojans lead the all-time series 18-11 but have fallen to the Sun Devils twice in the last four years. Fortunately for the home fans, this year’s action kicks off 4:30 p.m. PST at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where USC has beaten ASU seven times in a row. Even with that  on their side, All-American junior defensive end Leonard Williams and the Trojans will take nothing for granted.
“Arizona State is a good team,” Williams said. “They come to play.”

If there was one food trend that’s probably been exhausted in Los Angeles, it’s ramen: The savory Japanese noodle soup has created a coast-to-coast phenomenon and endeared itself to Angelenos in particular. On the other side of the country, former computer programmer-turned-ramen chef Keizo Shimamoto sandwiched a premium ground chuck patty between two “buns” made of freshly cooked ramen noodles. The creation, dubbed the ramen burger, was first served by Shimamoto at Brooklyn’s famous food market Smorgasburg in the summer of 2013.
Odd couple· The Original Ramen Burger is the brainchild of former computer programmer-turned-ramen chef Keizo Shimamoto. When Shimamoto first introduced the ramen burger at Smorgasburg, a Brooklyn-area “Food Flea Market,” the chef received an overwhelming response. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Shimamoto’s ramen burger started a craze in New York comparable to that of Dominique Ansel’s cronut, and it was only a matter of time before Shimamoto himself appeared on an episode of Conan and became a darling of the New York media. Los Angeles area residents had to wait a full year enduring knock-offs and wannabes before Shimamoto brought his ramen burger to the West Coast, but the wait is finally over. The Original Ramen Burger opened right next to the Lock and Key Bar in the heart of Koreatown earlier this summer, and reactions have been mixed.
Calling The Original Ramen Burger’s storefront “spartan” would be a massive overstatement: The shack amounts to a literal hole in the wall, where diners form a queue to order and pick up at the same window. There’s nary a place to sit, as diners are either expected to eat the burgers standing up or in their cars.
As for the burgers themselves, The Original Ramen Burger offers three varieties: the original, which is a USDA prime ground chuck patty topped with a “secret shoyu glaze,” scallions, baby arugula all sandwiched between two handmade “ramen buns.” The “La Sriracha Macha” takes all of the aforementioned ingredients and adds La Sriracha Macha, a Los Angeles-based take on the famous hot pepper sauce.  La Sriracha Macha has a smoky flavor profile that isn’t found in the Huy Fong Foods version, and bottles of the hot sauce (which are difficult to find elsewhere) are available for sale at The Original Ramen Burger. Perhaps most intriguing is the rotating “special” ramen burger, which promises a creative take on the ramen burger to be rotated from time to time.
The burger itself is a bit of a textural anomaly. Unlike previous, lesser iterations of the ramen burger in California, the ramen “bun” holds up its structural integrity instead of being a sloppy mess of noodles. Shimamoto’s bun is a solid disc of Sun Brand ramen noodles gently caramelized on one side, which gives it a crispy sheen that makes it suitable for use in a sandwich. The result is a visually pleasing “burger bun” with a puzzling texture. There is no way in which this textural amalgam of semi-chewy ramen noodles — that is simultaneously not quite crunchy where it is caramelized — could be considered pleasant.
The burger patty is serviceably moist thanks to its 75/25 beef-to-fat ratio, and juices will have a hard time being contained in the restaurant’s creative, Chinese bao-style wrappers. Crunchy, chopped scallions lend the proceedings an added crunch and give an extra punch to the secret shoyu glaze, which has the potential to be an explosion of umami if it weren’t for it being so sparingly used. Instead, little pockets of the glaze create pleasant bites of the burger, which is ultimately marred by the awkward texture of the ramen buns.
The shack also offers a variety of fry options, including garlic fries, cheese fries and miso seaweed fries — it’s here that The Original Ramen Burger is surprisingly good. The miso seaweed fries aren’t just a hacky attempt at American-Japanese junk food fusion — they actually work incredibly well together, with the deep, nutty flavor of Japanese nori lending the fries an added element of sheer addictiveness.
All considered, The Original Ramen Burger is basically a lot of hype for what’s actually just a little bit of burger. It’s hard to take the hype seriously when the entire reason for the dish’s novelty is exactly what’s wrong with the dish: if Shimamoto’s burger was on a nice buttered brioche bun instead of his handmade “ramen bun,” it actually could have been better, and that’s perhaps the biggest shame. This isn’t to say the ramen burger isn’t worth a try — just don’t forget to pick up an order or five of those delicious miso-seaweed french fries.

David Fincher is a director celebrated for approaching his subjects with a clinical curiosity usually reserved for back-alley surgeons and unscrupulous morticians. His films are clean, elegant surfaces whose austere contours mask the stench of madness and moral decay. So how did the dispassionate perfectionist behind Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac become the industry’s go-to guy for adapting glorified airport novels?
Gone Girl, Fincher’s latest exercise in freeze-dried formalism, is based on former Entertainment Weekly television critic Gillian Flynn’s 2012 psychological thriller, which follows the cloud of suspicion that descends on Midwestern charmer Nick Dunne, played in the film by Ben Affleck, after the disappearance of his pregnant wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. It also marks the second time in four years that Fincher has attempted to bring a mainstream bestseller to the big screen, following his slick but financially disappointing remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
Flynn’s novel, which takes partial inspiration from the real-life murders of Laci Peterson and her unborn child by her husband Scott back in 2002, is equal parts pulpy mystery –— Amy leaves behind a series of cryptic clues as part of an anniversary-themed scavenger hunt — and lurid character study, a story that aspires to double as a chilling vivisection of twenty-first century marriage. It also happens to be pretentious, preposterous and criminally over-plotted, hamstrung by a weak ending and populated by artificial characters spouting reams of self-consciously “witty” dialogue.
Do these flaws make Fincher’s version doomed by design? Absolutely not. Plenty of great movies have begun their lives as mediocre books, albeit ones with loyal followings.
Mario Puzo’s The Godfather was replete with extraneous subplots and gratuitous sex scenes before Francis Ford Coppola trimmed the fat and removed the constant references to Sonny Corleone’s comically large endowment. Steven Spielberg turned Peter Benchley’s slim paperback Jaws into the quintessential summer blockbuster by adding emotional complexity to its unlovable characters – the director himself admitted to rooting for the shark while reading the book — and changing the bleak, unsatisfying ending to the explosive finale we all know and love. Even Cormac McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men was considered a nonessential organ in the author’s body of work before the Coen Brothers elevated it to the level of sinister art.
In spite of its many issues, the core concept of Gone Girl is an inherently compelling one. Much of the story unfolds in flashback, revealing Nick and Amy’s life together and how their once-idyllic marriage has devolved into a poisonous viper’s nest of barely contained resentments and the specter of physical abuse.
It turns out the couple was forced to move back to Nick’s sleepy Missouri hometown after the big lug was downsized from his job as a New York journalist, compelling Amy, a lifelong trust fund baby whose psychologist parents used her as the inspiration for their “Amazing Amy” children’s book series, to forsake her socialite lifestyle and sink the last of her money into buying a local dive bar for Nick and his devoted twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) to run together while they care for their cancer-stricken mother and Alzheimer’s-addled father. Nick and Amy’s rented McMansion, meanwhile, quickly becomes a beige-colored prison for Amy, who finds herself unable — or perhaps just unwilling — to give small-town living a chance.
Affleck, with his corn-fed good looks and plastered-on smirk, is definitely an inspired choice to play Nick, the gone-to-seed golden boy who reacts to the news of his wife’s vanishing with an eerie mixture of stoicism, evasiveness and the occasional look of genuine relief. The nervous energy that used to make him appear ill at ease in earlier roles is actually working in his favor here. In fact, the inscrutable expression on his face when the press takes his picture in front of Amy’s giant missing poster — a smile perched right on the edge between charming and creepy — might end up being the film’s most haunting image.
It’s also gratifying to see Pike, the 35-year-old British actress who’s spent the better part of the last fifteen years inhabiting small but memorable roles in movies such as Die Another Day, Jack Reacher and The World’s End, finally getting her time in the sun. She reportedly beat out the likes of Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain, Olivia Wilde, Abbie Cornish, Natalie Portman, and Emily Blunt to win the part of “Amazing Amy,” and it’s not difficult to see why. The film’s final trailer does a commendable job of showing her character’s delicate yet spiteful nature without spoiling anything for the uninitiated. She even appears comfortable reciting the heavy-handed voiceover dialogue (yes, Flynn wrote the script, which means the rumors about the ending being changed are probably false).
So where will Fincher go from here? Aside from his commitment to direct the first season of HBO’s upcoming conspiracy thriller series Utopia (also written by Flynn), will the meticulous maestro continue blending pulp and prestige (rumors of him directing The Girl Who Played with Fire are also picking up steam), or will he return to his grimy shocker roots? Or will he try his hand at something completely different, perhaps his oft-delayed adaptation of Eric Powell’s supernatural gangster comic The Goon, or a big-screen version of Arthur C. Clarke’s seminal sci-fi tale Rendezvous with Rama? A new Fincher project always bears watching, especially when he decides to think beyond the airport bookstore.

When arguing about a social issue like the legalization of marijuana, it is very easy to oversimplify the conversation. In reality, the problem, along with every other social issue that persists, has a thicket of complications around it that need to be addressed if the problem is to be solved. Brett Harvey’s new documentary, The Culture High, addresses the issue of marijuana legalization and, at the very least, has to be commended for trying to wrangle with every factor that complicates the topic. The film tackles complex issues as varied as privatized prisons, NSA spying and media punditry and their direct effects on the conversation about marijuana. This admirable due diligence paid to addressing the complexity of the problem also cripples the film, however, as it is intrinsically superficial due to the constraints of a two-hour runtime.
Star-studded · The film features a cavalcade of stars and medical professionals giving their support for the cause. Joe Rogan (above) the most prevalent voice in the film along with Snoop Dogg and Richard Branson. – Photo courtesy of Phase 4 Films
The film’s direction starts out very straightforwardly. The first half hour or so is dedicated to debunking myths about the effects of marijuana use. A mix of medical professionals and celebrities are paraded in to recount the overwhelming evidence against marijuana being addictive, against it causing schizophrenia, against it being as harmful as smoking cigarettes or drinking, et cetera. It is what one expects to see when watching a film arguing for marijuana legalization. The visuals are crisp and attention-grabbing. Well-spoken academics like Lester Grinspoon, associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and David Nutt, the chair of the neuropsychopharmacology department at the Imperial College in London provide hard evidence. Energetic celebrities like Joe Rogan and Snoop Dogg argue the case. It’s entertaining and funny but also informative, focusing on the central issue.
After that first half hour, however, the film takes a decided turn, it feels like a free association game on what is wrong with America. It first dives into the drug war, bringing in several ex-members of the justice and law enforcement systems to add their voices to the chorus. This ties in directly with the central issue and would also be mentioned in any competent film about legalization. The focus doesn’t stay there for long, though. The rest of the film is essentially a parade of 10-minute primers on a series of interconnected societal flaws. The war on drugs discussion transitions into a short overview on the militarization of the police, then the horrors of having a privatized prison system. Following that is a 20-minute section on the blatant hypocrisy and corruption of the practices in big pharmaceutical companies. Next up is 15 minutes on the interconnectedness of big media and government. After that is a 10-minute bit on the ethical issues associated with lobbying in government. Marching right along is the NSA for five quick minutes. It’s a whirlwind of valid points, but something gets lost in addressing everything in such quick succession.
Every single one of those issues is a serious one. Every one of them would be a fantastic focus of its own hard-hitting documentary. Entire books have been written about each of them as they are all littered with complexities of their own. Again, credit has to be given for the inclusion of all of these issues as they all, in one way or another, influence the legalization of marijuana. By opening up a can of worms in the process, however, the film leaves the viewer a little dizzy trying to keep up with all the diverse issues flying across the screen. It takes away any conciseness from the overall film.
It’s a lose-lose situation to be a documentary filmmaker tackling a complex issue like this one, if the film takes the route of the first thirty minutes and just focuses on the central issue, ignoring all the external factors, it can be entertaining and informative but it won’t really identify the entire problem. If a film takes the path of trying to address everything, there is no way to cover all the problems satisfactorily in two hours. The content included in the film, properly giving due time to everything, would make a very interesting TV series. Every issue would get an hour or so and each week viewers would get a proper overview of the next complex issue. It could even all be tied together under the blanket of the legalization debate as all these problems do have some connection to the issue, some of those are more tenuous than others, of course.
Instead, Brett Harvey shot for the moon and it’s hard to say that he succeeded. Every small subsection of the film is both interesting and entertaining, it’s never boring. His talent as a director shows as he is able to navigate all of these different issues with a steady hand, giving the film a very consistent directorial tone. And there are genuinely fascinating stories included in the story. Viewers are introduced to Howard Marks, a former international smuggler of marijuana who used to covertly transport his shipments within the amplifiers of famous rock and roll bands, like Eric Clapton’s band and Pink Floyd, without the their knowledge in the ‘80s. His story was stuffed with adventure. The film showed the story of Jason David, the father of a child who suffered from constant debilitating seizures. These were only stopped when the child started taking medical marijuana. That brief story packed a serious emotional punch in a small amount of time. Cenk Uygur’s battles with the higher-ups at CNN over calling out media bias were recounted and added a flash of corporate intrigue.
The film consists of a series of compelling snippets but never really coalesces into a well-defined whole. Harvey’s steady direction keeps the ship remarkably level throughout the stream-of-consciousness journey through the gauntlet of issues but the end result is a sort of introductory class on things to be outraged about as opposed to something offering real answers.

Media coverage on the Ebola virus appears to be spreading through the general population with greater speed than the virus itself. With all the scary headlines, it seems almost certain that readers won’t even get a chance to pick up this column in the racks this morning.
When a falling acorn hits Chicken Little on the head in the classic fable, instead of any sensible reaction, the poor bird screams:
“THE SKY IS FALLING!”
Ebola is this year’s acorn -— in light of the first Ebola diagnosis in the United States, it seems to have fallen out of a tree and hit the media on the head. They’re telling us that the sky is falling — but it’s not, and the following is a much-needed common-sense reminder of why.
Ebola first got the journalists scrambling when it grew to epidemic level proportions in several African nations, including Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Then it reared its head again when news outlets began reporting every time a hospital tested someone in the United States for the disease. Those articles conveniently fail to inform Americans that Ebola possesses similar symptoms to the common stomach flu, which meant the testing really wasn’t all that unusual.
But that was all just a buildup to the media’s big heyday: on Sept. 20, a Dallas man named Thomas Eric Duncan returned to the United States from a trip to Liberia. He reported to the E.R. a few days later with stomach flu-like symptoms, was sent home, returned two days later and was diagnosed with the Ebola virus, the first known case to be diagnosed in the United States.
You would think that not just the sky, but the entire universe and all its contents, had fallen on the state of Texas. “Dallas ER Sent Ebola Infected Patient Home,” screamed one headline. “Dallas Ebola patient vomited outside apartment on way to hospital,” said another.
A better illustration of the hysteria comes in this shocking stat — before Duncan, the Center for Disease Control has responded to 94 Ebola inquiries in the United States, and Duncan is the first to test positive.
But to further reassure those scared among us, let’s take two walks: one down fact-check lane, and the other down memory lane.
Fact: It is very difficult to get Ebola. It is not an airborne virus like the common cold. It is so difficult, in fact, that to be at risk for the disease, you need to come into contact with the spit, vomit, blood, semen, sweat, urine or feces of a person who may have Ebola. If you haven’t, you do not have Ebola. If you live in Dallas, but didn’t happen to lick up the vomit that the above headline was so concerned about reporting, you do not have Ebola. In countries like the United States, containing and eliminating the disease is very simple: anyone who gets it is quarantined, along with those they have come into contact with. Eventually, the disease disappears. This explains why the only areas significantly affected by Ebola were poverty-stricken regions of Central Africa that fall victim to poor health care systems. Even more affluent nations in Africa like Nigeria and Senegal were able to stop the disease cold when 20 people were infected last July.
Do not get me wrong — Ebola is a terribly deadly disease, and the Center for Disease Control is right to pay careful attention to containing it both in Africa and in places like Dallas, where it has now surfaced. But it’s not going to kill us all, not by a long shot. A lot of the scare factor surrounding the disease is that it is such a painful killer, essentially eating the body’s non-essential organs from the inside out.
But media hysteria needs to stop — and a walk down memory lane reminds us why. In 2009, it was the swine flu — and in one week during that year, the Project for Excellence in Journalism documented 43 percent of the airtime devoted to the disease. That caused people to behave irrationally: Mexico quarantined people who had no connection to the disease, and Egypt slaughtered 300,000 pigs despite not having a single case present in the country at the time. This time, parents in Dallas are pulling their children out of school, despite the fact that Ebola is only contagious when symptoms develop, which takes around 21 days — meaning anyone Duncan touched won’t have symptoms until at least a week from now.
The United States knows how to deal with diseases — and there is no reason to think this one is any different. For context, the regular flu (which no one is terrified of) kills approximately 100 people in America each day.
There remains some optimism in all of this. Recently, a benign and fact-heavy CBS article titled “Ebola in the U.S.: What you need to know now” was the most popular story on their website. The second-most read story? “Report: Teachers accused of sex with the same student.” Number three? “Baby Clinton leaves hospital.”
At least readers have their priorities (somewhat) in order.

Being some one who suffers from a disease that over 150,00 people contract every year this whole Ebola hype absolutely disgusts me. I have been battling Coccicidiomycosis,  otherwise known as Valley Fever. A labeled “Obscure Orphan disease” by the CDC and World Health Organization.  This is a disease that kills approximately 10,000 people a year in the Southwestern United States and is allocated under 1 million dollars a year for research. As of now there is still no cure. Yet our Government gets spooked from a disease that is killing people half way around the world and is now acting as if Eola is an epidemic here in the United States.
Isn’t it time that we start treating diseases that are affecting US citizens on a daily basis and not some hyped up disease primarily affecting people in Africa?  We as a country need to get our priorities straight. Millions of dollars a year are spent on Cancer research. And rightfully so. But there are other diseases. Specifically Valley Fever, that are spreading and killing people and wrecking economic disasters on the families of those affected by such a horrible disease. Being a staff member of the “Trojan Family” I personally think it’s time for USC to step in and up and take the lead in finding a cure for what is killing me and so many others in this state.. USC already studies Coccicidiomycosis as a chemical weapon in the US arsenal. Please take that money and actually find a cure for the “Silent Epidemic” that is currently running unchecked through California and Arizona. My bout with Cocci went into remission just last month but thousands still suffer from this everyday. Please do the right thing and bring these little known diseases to the fore front of medical research

In a new initiative, the city of Pasadena recently repurposed parking meters to collect change for the homeless, launching the conversation about implications of anti-poverty initiatives closer to home. The 14 parking meters, which will fund programs that support the homeless, is intended to reduce panhandling and the direct donations from citizens to the homeless.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
“This is a clear alternative [to panhandling] where people contributing know that all the money will go to effective services,” Pasadena Housing Director Bill Huang told the Los Angeles Times.
Though passive panhandling raises its own concerns — namely, whether the money will be used for food or drugs — our mistrust of this direct donation implies something more startling about the general population, especially here at USC: for many of us, homelessness is an issue often out of sight and out of mind because it’s simply uncomfortable to face head-on.
There’s something about interactions with the homeless that is deeply confrontational. The unnerving interruption of daily routine with the sight of those in disrepair, perhaps with a sign and a cup for spare change that tugs at the heart, is a jarring reminder of a harsh reality. Any response, be it giving a donation or ignoring panhandlers, evokes the same heartbreaking emotion. It places the responsibility on the individual, overwhelmed by the glaring evidence of greater socioeconomic issues at large in the community.
At USC, the disparity is even more conspicuous. According to Richard Parks, the executive director of the USC Sol Price Center for Social Innovation, in L.A. County, 27 percent of citizens live under the poverty line — the highest rate in California. Contrast that with USC students, many of whom pay up to $65,000 per year in tuition and room and board fees to attend the university. Though there is plenty of income diversity among USC students, it’s hard to miss the flagrant difference between USC and the community, especially since many poverty-stricken neighborhoods are just blocks from campus.
It makes sense then that an anti-poverty initiative would work to help the homeless while reducing the fundamental discomfort initiated by panhandlers. But by donating to homeless organizations instead of to the homeless directly, we indicate that we trust organizations to deal with homelessness rather than the homeless themselves. Such an assumption is dangerous — for one, it implies that the homeless are unable to take care of themselves. Such a mindset makes homeless seem synonymous to helpless, and reduces the number of people who might seek resources for their financial situation because of personal pride. Second, though we might like to say that pandhandlers’ questionable motives keep us from giving more to them, nonprofit organizations are also not always transparent.
Reducing panhandlers also conceals the issue of homelessness in our community; these parking meters can be used as an excuse to push the homeless out of well-populated areas. And with them out of sight, we cannot truly expect to attack the full range of social causes that contribute to homelessness. Ranging from mental illness to violence or abuse, the homeless have faced and continue to face unique experiences that lead to their situation. And instead of focusing solely on relief, we need to also take a macroscopic and microscopic look into the web of issues that cause homelessness.
Lilly Taing, a student leader of A Community Place, a USC student organization that packs lunches for the homeless, shared her thoughts on reaching out to combat those root problems. “Growing up, I was uncomfortable with homelessness because I thought these people didn’t work hard and had bad habits, and that’s why they were on the streets,” Taing said. “But working with these people and talking to them shows you that there’s more than just placing all the blame on these individuals. I encourage others who are interested in learning more about homelessness, or if they want to get out of their comfort zone, to learn more about these issues.”
It’s okay to be uncomfortable with homelessness. In fact, it’s important that we are. Sure, a city without panhandling is a pretty one, but if homelessness is prevalent, the discomfort that accompanies panhandling is crucial because it is a constant reminder to us that there is still work to be done. It stresses our inherent sense of obligation as citizens to do our part in bettering our community. And especially on a campus like USC, we need the reminder.
We don’t need to empty our wallets for every panhandler or donate to every homeless program. But we also don’t need to hide from homelessness or shrink in fear and ignorance. We can do our own research, form our own opinions on the issue and then get involved in our own ways — whether it be volunteering, supporting a certain initiative or just listening to the stories of the homeless.

Congress ended session on Sept. 23, giving Americans another opportunity to evaluate their representatives before engaging in their civic duty at the ballot boxes this November. Though Congressmen will spend the next six weeks back at their home districts to address their reelection campaigns, Americans have yet another opportunity to assess the elements plaguing this dysfunctional Congress.
It is no secret that Americans feel that their representatives are not following through with their primary duty: representing their citizens. A recent poll demonstrates that about 53 percent of the country’s likely voters believe that neither the Democratic nor Republican party represents the interests of the American people. With gridlock, partisanship and special interests, it is evident that Congress is inefficient and that they fail to accurately represent the interests of the citizens, which are becoming increasingly alienated and unaccounted for. The biggest issue plaguing the American political landscape is the lack of congressional accountability to their constituents – indubitably resulting from the lack of congressional term limits.
Though the lack of term limits has had a tremendous impact on American democracy, conventional perspectives would commonly attribute this failure in accountability to the effect of money in politics. And with decisions like Citizens United and McCutcheon v. FEC, that have removed political spending limits by corporations and aggregate spending limits by people, as well as immensely increasing the influence special interest groups can assert in politics, this attribution has not come without merit. This is easily understood by just witnessing the amount of time congressmen spend each day fundraising for their campaign rather than performing their legislative duties. When donors have frequent access to congressmen and can give large sums at any point in time (say before voting on certain legislation), it is easy to understand how the issues that our representatives focus on are skewed to the agenda of their campaign donors.
Though campaign finance has greatly threatened the ability for congressmen to accurately represent their constituents and not special interest groups, the constitutionally inherent lack of term limits, coupled with high incumbency rates has created a collection of career politicians more interested in reelection and staying in power than serving their constituents, and this has disintegrated accountability in politics and has endangered the representation of Americans more than any campaign finance legislation. Today’s political system is illustrated by a myriad of Congressmen who are not accountable for their legislative duties yet hold office time and time again. Political satisfaction rates for congressmen are at an all time low, with only six percent of probable voters believing that their representatives are doing a good or excellent job, according to Rasmussen Reports. Yet, even with a number so low, the incumbency rates for congressmen are at a staggering 90 percent.
Such tenacious incumbency can be explained by the immense advantages available to representatives that enable them to perpetually maintain offices. These advantages include name recognition, gerrymandered districts that favor parties, and most importantly, the ability to raise more funds than competitors. Seven hundred percent more funds were distributed in the 2008 election cycle to incumbents than to their challengers. This demonstrates the strong implausibility that incumbents have of losing office – a very dangerous reality that perpetuates a legislative body that virtually no longer needs the legitimacy or satisfaction of its citizens.
The lack of term limits has severely threatened the representation of American citizens in this democratic system. Simply stated, legislators have no accountability. When it is more important for congressmen to support the donors and special interests groups that assist them in remaining incumbents than it is to perform their legislative duty, there is virtually no necessity to represent or care about the interests of their constituents.
America needs term limit legislation right now in order to repair a system that enables congressmen to be virtually unaccountable to their citizens. This has over time created a legislative body that is constantly bought out by special interest groups and therefore alienated by the needs and desires of constituents. When Congressmen are more interested in staying in power than representing their citizens, they become susceptible to corruption and the whims of special interest groups.
Not only would term limits diminish the strength of incumbency and the power of special interest groups, but it would also reorient the focus of elected officials to effecting change or enacting the platform that they were voted in on, instead of establishing an immortal career in politics. On top of creating a body that is more accountable to the citizens they represent instead of donors, term limits invigorate progress in Congress (two rarely synonymous words) by bringing in fresh ideas, incentivizing quicker action, limiting the chance for corrupt officials and their scope of corruption, diminishing the focus on special interests and the importance for image and legacy when trying to accomplish what is important.
Though money in politics has had a devastating effect on the representation of citizens, a lack of term limits allows congressmen to be unaccountable, making it easier to care more for pleasing special interest groups in order to establish permanent careers in Congress than to represent American citizens. The best way to mitigate the ills is to bring in term limits.
