A malaise struck the gaming community’s considerable Internet presence  just after the first day of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the industry’s annual trade show famously known as E3.
Many who have followed the industry since before the current generation of systems has felt the dearth of creativity indicated by the glut of sequels.
A massive poster for “Assassin’s Creed 2” adorns the outside of the Los Angeles Convention Center, all but announcing the convention as a showcase for new iterations of popular franchises. Some fared the immediate amateur and professional critical onslaught on the Internet better than others. 
Microsoft unveiled the latest in their blockbuster “Halo” series for the Xbox 360, subtitled “Reach,” in an oddly pleasing teaser trailer that revealed nothing about the game. The “Halo” sequel seemed to be the cause of the loudest cries for innovation from gamers, yet it is difficult to deny the excellence of such an expensive, beloved brand.
As if anticipating complaint about their sequel obsession, Microsoft trotted out one of the most engaging gameplay demonstrations of the show in “Alan Wake,” its horror-adventure game about a mystery writer who searches for his missing wife in a mountain town besieged by the supernatural. 
“Alan Wake” has rightfully been compared to the classic “Silent Hill” series, but the gameplay Microsoft showed off has a fluid feeling reminiscent of “Resident Evil,” and the story and setting could just as well have been inspired by Stephen King or David Lynch.  “Alan Wake” is currently slated for a 2010 release.
For those not obsessed with the legendary “Metal Gear Solid” or “Final Fantasy” series, perhaps the only pleasure in seeing new sequels was the perverse joy in seeing Sony’s anchor franchises being played on the Xbox for the first time. “Metal Gear Solid: Rising” centers ominously on a protagonist other than recurring hero Snake and “Final Fantasy XIII” looks like every game to precede it in the series: visually stunning and thematically familiar.

The other highlight from the Microsoft showing was Project Natal, a very high tech motion sensing camera that serves as a controller with capabilities at once similar and different from the Wii. The uses of this fantastic technology look amazing. In some ways, Microsoft stole the show with this potentially thrilling new innovation.
Combating the rather understated “Halo Reach” trailer was Bioware’s almost stupidly epic preview for its massively multiplayer online role playing game “Star Wars: The Old Republic:” an entirely cinematic affair showcasing epic lightsaber duels which years of “Star Wars” games have shown could not possibly be duplicated in actual gameplay. Regardless, a talented company like Bioware playing with a brand as popular as “Star Wars” might have the mettle to finally topple Blizzard’s currently unassailable MMORPG champ “World of Warcraft.”
Nintendo bounced back from their legendarily meager showing at E3 2008 with some interesting new hardware innovations and franchise titles. Its biggest push was the Wii Motion Plus, an add-on for the Wiimote that allows for more precision motion control. WiiFit Plus, another version of the WiiFit, was more a software than a hardware innovation, but a short look at a platform game that requires players to actually jump up and down to avoid obstacles was one of the most intriguing points of the presentation.
Company president Satoru Iwata made an appearance to give a sneak peak at the Wii Vitality Sensor, a pulse-measuring peripheral device that elicited groans from some gamers but undoubtedly had cash registers ringing in the heads of the large crowd of investors at E3, an orchestra inspired by the phenomenal success of the WiiFit in the past year.
Where old-school Nintendo-philes are concerned, the industry giant saved the best for last with two spectacular trailers for updates of classic series. “Super Mario Galaxy 2” looked about as staggeringly fun as its immediate predecessor, but the real shock was a gorgeous new third-person “Metroid” game from the brilliant minds at Team Ninja  — developers new to  the franchise. The game looks like a wild and thrilling departure in gameplay and theme from any that have come before, and after the trailer ran there wasn’t an unsoiled pair of underwear in the house.
Sony closed out the press conferences with a traditionally strong showing. Its two biggest announcements for the PlayStation 3 were “Final Fantasy XIV,” a new online adventure in the same mold as the massively multiplayer online “Final Fantasy XI,” and a prototype of a high-tech motion sensing controller similar to the Wiimote — proving that, like Microsoft, Sony has taken notice of the market strength of the Wii.
“Uncharted 2: Among Thieves” was undoubtedly the best-looking game — sequel or not — of the show. Sony followed this graphical innovation with live gameplay from “Mag,” a long-awaited first person shooter that allows up to 256 players to participate in a battle royale.
The tiny new PSP Go was famously leaked a full day before Sony intended to show it off. It doesn’t ultimately matter that the surprise was spoiled, the redesigned portable platform has some amazing new media features that made it one of the best revelations of the convention. Games announced include a new “Gran Turismo” title and “Metal Gear Solid: Peacewalker,” a direct sequel to “Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.”
The Electronic Entertainment Expo is a festival tailor-made for professionals in the industry and yet consumed so totally by gamers. It is a strange brew of software and hardware demos. Even though the shows were somewhat dominated by sequels, many of the surprises unveiled by the industry giants may prove to be revolutions both small and big within a sea of mundanity.

If it were possible, I would spend every free moment at the Happiest Place on Earth.
As it is, I am a Disneyland annual pass holder, and I visit the park at least once a month — you know, to get my money’s worth.
Disneyland is more than just an amusement park — it has a special, inexplicable quality that reliably draws thousands of visitors from all across the globe every single day, rain or shine.
California dreamin’ · Holders of Disneyland’s annual pass are greeted with a bevy of options, from food to rides, once they enter the amusement park, known commonly as the Happiest Place on Earth. Lucy Mueller | Summer Trojan 
Now, we all know that there is no better way to spend a hot Southern California summer afternoon than by standing in lines for hours and eating overpriced Mickey-shaped ice cream bars, but a trip to Anaheim’s greatest attraction can be made even more enjoyable if you know a few insider tips about workings of the park.
I  may not be a certified Disneyland Cast Member (the clever name given to the park workers), but I have been to Club 33, a members-only restaurant, and trust me, that guarantees I know the park inside and out.
The first point of information that needs to be stressed to any Disneyland visitor is the importance of arriving at the park as soon as the gates open in the morning.  A ticket to the park is not cheap, and you want to be sure to get the most bang for your buck.
For the first hour or so of the park’s operation you can expect to encounter little to no lines, which means you should hit up the most popular rides first — this includes the Matterhorn, one of the few rides that does not offer Fast Passes, which should be utilized as much as possible.
Another trick to extend the length of your visit is to stay in the park an hour after it officially closes.  If you are waiting in line for a ride at the  closing hour, you are allowed to stay until you have gone through, so make a mad dash for Space Mountain before closing time.
Also, Main Street, the opening stretch of shops and brick road that marks the entrance to the park, stays open one hour after the posted time.  Take this extra hour to get late-night sundaes at the Gibson Girl Ice Cream Shoppe or pick up souvenirs. Just be careful not to get sucked into buying too much — the clothing stores at Disneyland actually maintain a consistently colder temperature than normal in order to sway customers into purchasing sweatshirts.
The other half of the Disneyland experience is that oft-overlooked park called California Adventure, which is currently undergoing a major construction overhaul. The entire park is getting a new facelift, and over the course of the next couple of years, a variety of new attractions will be making their grand debut, including a new water-lights show.
California Adventure also offers a quick and cost-efficient means to soothe any unruly stomach rumblings that may hit you during your stay.  Just stop by the Mission Tortilla Factory or the Boudin Bakery for some complimentary fresh tortillas and sourdough bread.
If you want to get the most out of the rides at Disneyland, search for the Hidden Mickeys scattered throughout each one.  The three-circle heads of Mickey Mouse are waiting to be discovered by anyone who looks for them. Here’s a hint for one of them: look at the wagon wheels lying on the ground on Big Thunder Mountain.
If you choose to go on Soarin’ Over California, ask a Cast Member to put you on the top row — it makes the ride much more phenomenal. And be sure to take a ferry to Tom Sawyer’s Island, located in the middle of Disneyland. This largely forgotten playground is usually pretty empty and, unexpectedly, really fun.
On the other hand, I would  forgo most of the rides in Storybook Land  — they always have huge lines and, truthfully, are rather boring.
As an added bonus, in 2009 Disneyland is offering park-goers free admission to the park on their birthdays. All you have to do is register online in advance at www.disneyland.disney.go.com. This is an incredible deal for anyone who cannot otherwise afford to go.
If on your birthday you find yourself too bogged down with exams or hungover from your celebratory power hour the night before, the USC Ticket Office also offers outstanding discounts on admission — there, you can buy an adult Park Hopper ticket for only $73, instead of the usual cost of $94.
Visiting Disneyland is one of the greatest experiences available to USC students: You get to build memories, make your summer instantly enjoyable and fill your Facebook profile with pictures of you posing with Goofy.  Grab a water bottle, a jacket for the chilly nighttime breezes and your friends, and get ready to take a trip back to magic of childhood.

Up, up and away · Seventy-eight-year-old Carl Fredrickson lives his childhood dream of adventuring when he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and sets sail for South America. Unbeknownst to Carl, he is accompanied by 8-year-old Russell and a colorful cast of characters. Photos Courtesy of Buena Vista Pictures
No one compares to John Lasseter and his staff at Pixar.
It’s an exhausted statement, one that is uttered every time the Emeryville, Calif.-based studio releases a film in theaters; yet as its 10th feature-length film is a flawless affair of vibrancy and vivacity, it seems Pixar is still reaching for its highest peak — as always.
Arriving on the tailwind of “WALL-E,” Pixar’s last innovation that garnered an Academy Award (and many more nominations), is “Up,” the studio’s most recent eccentric masterpiece.
Just when critics and ordinary filmgoers alike thought no other film could match that droopy-eyed robot and his quest for love, “Up”  has just upped the animation ante.
Though the film delivers no new advancements in technology aside from being Pixar’s first 3-D venture, “Up” quickly earned its cinematic street cred — even prior to its release last Friday — when it became the first-ever animated film to open the Cannes Film Festival. There, the film gained more buzz than many of its live-action peers, including Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds.”
And with good reason.
What “Up” brings to the celluloid table is exquisite storytelling, an attentive focus on detail and an incredibly endearing, heartfelt character on which everything else so gratefully relies. Really, “Up” would not be nearly as affecting without its strongly crafted main protagonist.
When we first meet Carl Fredrickson, he’s a young child with frizzy red hair, missing teeth and much-too-large Urban Outfitter-chic glasses. He is positively giddy while sitting in a Depression-era movie theater, viewing a film on Charles Muntz, a widely respected explorer vaguely fashioned after Charles Lindberg.
Proudly sporting Muntz-inspired flight cap and goggles, Carl’s passion for adventuring is only sparked more when he encounters the spunky, fast-talking Ellie, a fellow aspiring adventurer with matching adventurer attire — it’s a matchmade in Pixar heaven.
Once again, the animators at Pixar prove they are masters of visual storytelling, for no words are needed to grasp the connection between Carl and Ellie. Instead of expositional dialogue, the audience is given a bittersweet montage set to a hauntingly beautiful waltz, unveiling a simple love story that is tainted with unexpected loss and missed opportunities. By the end of Carl and Ellie’s ballad, one’s face is stained with tears — and the film has barely reached its 10-minute mark.
Now, and for the remainder of the film, Carl is a 78-year-old misanthropic widower, living alone in the dream house Ellie and he built, accompanied only by his memories and tennis ball-adorned walker.
Both physically and emotionally fragile in his old age, Carl is in danger of losing his colorful house to the money-grubbing housing company usurping the neighborhood with its monochromatic skyscrapers — a notion with which Carl cannot live.
And so, “Up” takes off, sailing through the tendrils of imagination as effortlessly as thousands upon thousands of balloons sail a two-story house past skyscrapers. While what follows never quite reaches the opening sequence’s emotional apex, “Up” is colorful, zany and completely unexpected.

Included in the unexpected is Russell, a young and pudgy adventure scout (voiced by scene-stealer Jason Nagai) who finds himself a stowaway on Carl’s floating house after trying so desperately to receive his “aiding the elderly” badge.
While Carl is a man hardened by pain, living his life so unerringly guarded, Russell also has some pain of his own, despite for having such a short life. Yet Russell is able to openly deal with his emotions, a skill he inadverdently imposes on Carl. While he’s irritating, Russell is the one person who can crack Carl’s stoic shell — a heartwarming pleasure to watch.
Coupled with these emotional lows, of course, are the highs. Humor is found everywhere, from the naive yet well-intentioned Russell to the multicolored (female) bird that Russell hilariously misnames “Kevin” and the clingy mutt named “Dug” that would do anything for his master’s approval — unless, of course, there’s a squirrel nearby.
To say Pixar transcends the animated film genre would only degrade the genre, automatically labeling it as a lesser art form than live-action film. For what exactly makes an animated film? Any studio executive would tell you talking animals, a formulaic, three-part adventure and lots of slapstick humor. In recent years, the genre has been solely associated with children, and their ticket sales have become the targeted demographic.
“Up,” however, rounds out Pixar’s “grown-up” triumvirate, which also includes “Ratatouille” and the aforementioned “WALL-E.” Audacious and unconventional, poignant and witty — these films truly do not have a targeted audience in mind, and this is most refreshing about Pixar.
Lasseter and the rest never seem to write stifled by page count, sell-ability or turning point. Gimmick is not in their vocabulary; neither is formula. It is a rarity among the films Hollywood churns out these days, and Pixar is lucky enough to have the money and brand-name recognition to stick to its gut feelings and make what it wants to make — an enviable creative freedom it has yet to abuse.
You’re not going to the movies to see an animated film — you’re going to see a good story. “Up” is an excellent reminder that there’s no distinction between the two.

Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information More to cheer about · Only a week after winning the national championship, the Trojans are awarded the 2008 Pac-10 championship. Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The USC men’s tennis team was declared the 2008 Pac-10 champions Tuesday, May 29, after the Pac-10 Conference stripped the UCLA men’s tennis team of the title for allowing an ineligible player to compete during the 2008 season.
UCLA was required to forfeit all singles and doubles matches in which the ineligible athlete participated. After the results of each conference match were recalculated, the outcomes of two matches were reversed. Both USC and Arizona State were awarded victories for their matches against UCLA in April of 2008.
The two losses changed the Bruins’ previously undefeated 7-0 conference record to 5-2. The Trojans, who had been 6-1 before the outcome of their match with UCLA was reversed, are now 7-0 and have been declared conference champions.
UCLA self-reported the incident.
The implicated athlete received money that was paid up-front from an employer to pay for student fees. Once the compliance learned the money was paid up-front, it reported the incident to NCAAs and the Pac-10.
The athlete was cleared by the NCAA to participate in the 2009 season so long as he paid a portion of the fee amount to charity. During the 2009 season, however, the Pac-10 completed a separated evaluation of the incident and chose to strip the Bruins of their 2008 Pac-10 title.

Julian “Julie” Bescos, a multitalented athlete who played and coached three different sports for USC, died May 23 in Long Beach, Calif.. He was 97.
Bescos was an eight-time letterman for the Trojans, starring in football, basketball and baseball for his school.
On the gridiron, he helped lead USC to a national championship in 1932 and was made team captain in 1934. He was named the basketball team’s most valuable player in 1934 and was twice honored by the All-Pacific Coast Conference Southern Division. The Trojans won their league all three years that he played for the team on the hardwood.
As an outfielder, he helped pilot the Trojans to a league title in 1932.
Upon graduation, Bescos served as a coach for all three sports at the freshmen and junior varsity level in 1935. He later assisted the varsity football team from 1937 to 1941 and in 1945. As head coach of the men’s basketball team in 1942, he led the Trojans to a 12-8 record, second-best in the league.
Bescos was also a Navy veteran who served in World War II and an avid golfer who would later become president of the California and Southern California Golf Association.

Uncertain future · Tim Floyd’s recruiting class continues to falter. Brandon Hui | Summer Trojan 
The roster for next year’s USC men’s basketball team remains in flux following the departures of one of its top would-be returning players and its most highly touted recruit.
Forward Marcus Johnson had been granted an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA after transferring from Connecticut but has elected to turn pro instead of returning to the Trojans, according to the Los Angeles Times. He becomes the fourth USC player to forgo his remaining eligibility to pursue a professional career, joining guard Daniel Hackett and forwards DeMar DeRozan and Taj Gibson.
Noel Johnson has also requested to be released from his letter of intent because of the ongoing NCAA investigations into USC. Johnson, rated by most scouting services as one of the top 50 incoming freshmen in the country, is the third member of USC’s once highly decorated recruiting class to pursue other opportunities. Top 10 recruit Renardo Sidney has committed next season to play at Mississippi State and forward Solomon Hill defected to Pac-10 rival Arizona.
The remaining members of USC’s recruiting class who have signed letters of intent are guard Lamont “Momo” Jones and forwards Derrick Williams and Evan Smith.
Earlier in the offseason, point guard Donte Smith decided he would transfer to Cal State San Bernardino.

Leading the charge · Senior Tom Glissmeyer shot a final round 66 to help the Trojans advance to match play where they fell to Michigan. -  Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
The No. 3 USC men’s golf team staged a furious rally over the final 27 holes of stroke play to make it into the match play portion of the NCAA Championship, before falling to No. 34 Michigan in the quarterfinals.
The Trojans got off to a rough start at Inverness Golf Club in Toledo, Ohio, sitting in a distant 20th when the horn sounded for a rain delay on the second day of stroke play. USC was already playing without former NCAA individual champion Jamie Lovemark, who was out injured with a fractured rib.
“We came back out [from the delay] and we all knew it was going to take some great play to make it into the match play,” senior Tom Glissmeyer said. “So we all stepped up and played some really great golf.”
Glissmeyer led the Trojans by birdieing 11 out of his next 20 holes without a bogey. His final round score of 66 placed him in a tie for third in the individual competition won by N.C. State’s Matt Hill. Sophomore Tim Sluiter and freshman Steve Lim each shot four-under par 32 on their back nines of the second round and senior Ryan Linton made nine birdies over the course of his next three nines to help USC finish in a tie for third in stroke play.
“[The team] had a positive attitude and the most important thing is that they didn’t sulk,” coach Chris Zambri said.  “If they would have they wouldn’t have been able to come back and play the match play. It was a real big comeback.”
Eight teams qualified for the match play tournament, making USC’s first round opponent a sixth-seeded Michigan team that spent most of the year outside of the national spotlight. Under the new NCAA format, each of the five Trojan golfers was assigned a Wolverine opponent and the winner of the individual matches gained a point for their team.
Linton used two consecutive birdies on the 12th and 13th to take control of his match with Nick Pumford, winning when he was up three holes with only two to play. Steve Lim only made one birdie but his opponent Bill Rankin made seven bogeys, giving Lim the 4 and 3 victory.
Sluiter and Glissmeyer were unable to replicate their solid stroke play form, however, and lost their respective matches. Sluiter lost five holes in a nine-hole stretch, ending his match in a 5 and 3 loss to Alexander Sitompul. Glissmeyer lost the first hole of his match and was never able to recover, falling 4 and 3 to Matt Thompson.
“[Thompson] played a solid round and I didn’t take advantage of the opportunities I had to get back into the match,” Glissmeyer said. “It was a frustrating day and I feel like I ran out of holes.”
The match came down to the last group remaining on the course, Michigan’s Lion Kim (ranked No. 98 in the nation) and USC’s Matt Giles (No. 4). Giles made a costly double bogey on 10 and bogeys on 11 and 13, falling three holes behind with five to play.
He birdied 14 and 15 to close the gap to one but Kim’s birdie on the 17th ended USC’s season and dreams of a national championship.
“I’m really shocked I couldn’t get a win out of our top three guys. That’s the real bummer,” Zambri said. “It’s hard to believe. Those guys should be able to get one point for us.”
The Trojans had the higher ranked player in each of the five matches, adding to the disappointment.

“I have nothing but respect for any team that can make it to the top eight but that shouldn’t happen,” Zambri said.  “We were in a great side of the bracket and it was like ‘Man, we could have won that thing.’ Even without Jamie, we could have easily won. We just had some guys come out flat in the biggest round of the year and that’s unfortunate.”
Michigan lost in the next round to eventual champion Texas A&M, who defeated Arkansas in a tense final that came down to the last hole.
USC finished the season with two tournament victories and sophomore Matt Giles was named a PING first-team All-American.
The Trojans are losing Glissmeyer to graduation while Lovemark and Sluiter have decided to turn pro. Giles will also test the pro waters at PGA Tour qualifying school after the fall portion of next season.

Another notch in his belt · Junior Ahmad Rashad wins the 100-meter sprint again and is among the favorites to win in next week’s NCAA Championship, where the individual competition will be emphasized.  Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan
The beautiful 90-degree weather in Eugene, Ore. inspired the USC track team to rise up from the bottom last weekend, earning a collective 165 points with the men taking first place and women taking third place in the 2009 West Regional.
The men’s team ended the first day of competition in fourth place, but managed to score 80 points on the final day, bringing their total to 97, which was 16.25 more than the runner-up and the host of the meet, the Oregon Ducks. According to USC director of track and field Ron Allice, however, the sole agenda was to get individual athletes to the NCAA Championships.
“We did what we had to do to qualify for the national championship,” Allice said. “There wasn’t an area of the sport that we didn’t perform. Outside of the dual-meet against the Bruins, this was probably our most stellar meet. Fifty schools in the U.S. competed, and for us to score almost 100 points based on qualifying procedure is great.”
The NCAA Championship, which will take place June 10-13 in Fayetteville, Ark., required the track athletes to meet certain requirements to qualify. The athletes needed to finish in the top five in each area of the sport, except for relays where they needed to get into the top 3. USC earned its way to Arkansas with 13 individual athletes and four relay teams.
Junior Shalina Clarke won the title in the women’s 100-meter high hurdles (and earned the team 10 points in the women’s competition) and junior Ahmad Rashad took the men’s 100-meter dash title. The Trojans also grasped two other winning titles with the men’s 4x100m and 4x400m relay teams.
Along with the accolades received by the Trojans, they experienced a bit of concern when freshman Duane Walker ended the 4x400m relay falling to the track with a shoulder injury. X-rays were negative.
The men’s team was not the only team that came from behind to excel; the women’s team rose from seventh place on the first day of competition to finish third behind Arizona State and Oregon.
The Women of Troy began the competition with the 4x100m relay team, freshmen Aareon Payne and Erica Alexander and juniors Shalina Clarke and Judith Onyepunuka, who were timed at 44.81. They were slated to take fourth place, but when the Ducks were ruled out of zone during their run, the Women of Troy were moved up to third place, which gave them enough points to take it to Arkansas for the championship.
“Going through the results and the numbers of qualifiers, you can see that we all were missing the multi-event and 10,000-meter athletes, who didn’t have to go through this meet because of the closeness to regionals and finals,” Allice said. “Oregon didn’t have their multi-event and 10,000 meter people. The goal of everyone in the meet was to break up the Oregon ‘distance-machine’, and to do that in a qualifying meet and to score as well as we did, we surprised a lot of people.”
Leaving Oregon this weekend, the Trojans have a significantly large group of competitors getting ready for the championship in Arkansas in a couple weeks, and Allice said he believes they have all the pieces needed to excel in the finals.
“We’re going to go with large contingent of young people; around 15-17 guys and 13 girls,” he said. “That’s some good sizeable numbers to go to a national championship with. Our team is really focused and I am really proud of their continued excellence.”
The Trojan athletes qualifying for the NCAA Championships are: Nia Ali (heptathlon), Nate Anderson (400m), Kristine Busa (javelin), Shalina Clarke (100m high hurdles), Zsofia Erdelyi (3000m steeplechase), Brandon Estrada (pole vault), Joey Hughes (400m), Dalilah Muhammad (400m  intermediate hurdles), Eva Orban (hammer), Aareon Payne (200m), Ahmad Rashad (100m), Irek Sekretarski (800m), Blake Shaw (800m), Oscar Spurlock (110m HH), Corey White (javelin), Manjula Wijesekara (high jump), Aven Wright (triple jump) and both the men’s and women’s 4x100m and 4x400m relay teams.

Last week, President Barack Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor to become the first Hispanic and third woman to serve as a Supreme Court justice. While initially there were just a few outspoken Republicans against the appointment of Sotomayor — namely Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich — there is now a palpably rising concern in the Republican Party about the possibility of strong racial views coloring her rulings.
Sotomayor, 54, is of Puerto Rican heritage and grew up in the Bronx, N.Y.  During her years at Princeton University she was a strong and active supporter of minority rights, and has since served on almost every level of the judicial system.
However, it is exactly this history of actively supporting minority rights and her strong ties to her Hispanic culture that have caused rumblings of displeasure in the GOP. Many Republicans initially refrained from lashing out against Sotomayor, fearing they would further alienate the already fragile Hispanic vote.
Now the question on many minds is whether a woman who says her views are influenced by her Puerto Rican heritage and humble beginnings can make fair decisions in line with the Constitution in cases involving all races and social classes.
One statement Sotomayor made in 2001 stands at the heart of the controversy in the Senate. In a lecture given at the law school of UC Berkeley, Sotomayor said that a “wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life.’’
Some, including Obama, argue that Sotomayor’s comment was simply misworded; however, there is a growing concern in the Republican Party surrounding her nomination. Many contend that Sotomayor’s statement implies that because she is a minority, her ability to make decisions is superior to that of a white male. After all, isn’t this in of itself a racist remark — comparing and categorizing one race over another?
There is no denying that everyone’s individual views are shaped by personal experience; the question is whether these experiences bring about opinions and rulings that are in line with the Constitution. Rulings by the Supreme Court are of the highest authority, and accordingly need to be made by people most adept to ruling fairly, constitutionally and without personal bias.
Can Sotomayor, who said herself — with significantly more eloquence — that her views are shaped by her race and her humble socioeconomic background, fairly judge a large range of cases?
Ultimately, the answer will lie in her capabilities as a judge.
The GOP plans to make race a focus in the fight against Sotomayor’s nomination. Though it’s possible her comments only revealed a lack in judgement, a Supreme Court justice needs to be able to make decisions in accordance with the Constitution. With issues of race boiling over in the Senate, what once might have looked like a clear seal of approval for Sotomayor now looks far more ambiguous.

Lucy Mueller | Daily Trojan
SHANGHAI, China — Reports from various news sources Tuesday indicated that China has blocked internet access within the country to popular websites Twitter, Hotmail, Flickr and others.
While many within the country felt it was only a matter of time before this happened — I had already assumed the country’s censorship when my furious attempts to refresh Twitter were fruitless — I find this action on the Chinese government’s behalf to be truly pointless.
As the 20th anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising nears, China has decided to crack down on popular websites to prevent discussion of the taboo topic.
This is only one of many steps the government has already taken in its attempts to filter the information that reaches its citizens: The local media is censored, news outlets from other unfavorable countries such as Taiwan are prohibited and, after hosting videos of Tibet, YouTube is also blocked.
China’s hush-hush attitude might successfully stop political tweets about June 4, 1989 (a search that purposefully yields no results when Googling websites in Chinese), but how long can it keep playing this game?
It might take years, but the Chinese are slowly being exposed to people, events and ideas they never learned in their history classes or heard their parents speak of.
Though most of this can be attributed to the Internet — which explains the government’s efforts — information also spreads through other channels. With traveling professionals, exchange students, tourists and the global economy, China cannot shut down all exposure to potentially risky topics, and frankly officials shouldn’t even try. Why delay the inescapable?
What’s more, though, is that a once-sheltered society is learning — and liking — the ways of outsiders. As China embraces the joys of capitalism, its people are left wondering what else they are missing out on that the rest of the world is enjoying.
The thirst for knowledge might not be as intense as the thirst for money, yet ultimately having American identities like McDonald’s in Shanghai has given China a glimpse of what’s outside its great (fire)walls.
And so far, they are lovin’ it.
The country is growing ever so quickly, and its leaders do not understand that despite their best efforts, the spread of information is inevitable. If global marketing can make its way into Chinese minds (as Chinese mistresses demand BMWs and Balenciagas), then it won’t be much longer before democratic principles and ideals seep into the public consciousness as well.
China, I beg of you — please stop fighting the inevitable. You will only alienate and infuriate the citizens who already know of what you are trying to hide and spur them to try harder to enlighten others.
Additionally, your attempts will only close off the country to the rest of the world — foreigners who are putting faith in you and taking a chance by investing in your capital, trying to live in your country and visiting your monuments to learn about your wonderful history and legacy.
Why make that legacy tainted?

 USC researchers will take part in a nationwide research initiative during the next five years, as federal funding will go toward the establishment of a new center focused on energy conservation.
The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science will invest $777 million in Energy Frontier Research Centers — part of President Barack Obama’s Energy Frontier Research Center initiative, which aims to boost the number of scientific breakthroughs needed to increase the importance of energy in the economy. Out of approximately 260 applications from research institutions across the country, 46 were chosen — including USC.
Daniel Dapkus, a professor of electrical engineering and co-chair in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering in the Viterbi School of Engineering, will direct the program, which will focus on ways to conserve energy used from everyday light sources.
“We are focused on several goals,” said Mark Thompson, a chemistry professor who is the associate director of the center. “In solar cells, it is to understand the parameters limiting efficiency and light absorption.”
Thompson said another goal of the center was to improve the efficiency and color quality of solid state light sources.
The USC center — which has a total budget of approximately $16 million for the next five years — will be one of 16 that will be partially funded by Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The government will provide $12.5 million, and Viterbi and the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences will each contribute roughly $500,000 per year, said Yannis Yortsos, dean of Viterbi.
The government’s selection of USC as one of 31 universities where a center will be focused has larger implications for the university, Yortsos said, as USC now has the ability to play a pivotal role in the growing conservation movement.
“It shows that the energy initiative at the university is alive and kicking,” Yortsos said. “We are hoping for more centers in the area of energy for the future because it is a very important issue that has large implications for our future.”
Thompson said while the university’s selection was a compliment, the research team had high expectations to meet.
“It is a great honor that we were chosen, and really puts pressure on us to perform,” Thompson said. “We assembled a top-notch team that will deal in issues limiting the efficiencies of next generation solar cells and solid-state lighting sources. The U.S. Department of Energy saw the strength of our team and awarded us a center to pursue our proposed research objectives.”

Ana Pedroso was always late.
She didn’t know not to be, until she took USC’s new American Culture Class, a no-credit class aimed at introducing graduate students from other countries to life in Los Angeles.
“I am Brazilian — I am always late,” Pedroso, a graduate student studying economics, said. “They said that if we make an appointment we should be five minutes earlier. This is a detail that I think makes a difference and I would never learn such a thing in a book.”
Teaching things not found in books is precisely the aim of the American Culture Class, created by Chrissy Roth, assistant director of the Office of Orientation Programs and Becky Peterson, an international adviser in the Office of International Services. The class, which debuted last fall and is expanding to offer more sections for the upcoming semester, strives to provide international students with a grasp of some of the finer details of American culture.
Those details range from communication styles to politics to football.
“Football is very popular in the U.S. but in China we don’t have that kind of sport,” said Qi Li, a doctoral candidate in computer science. “So we spent one class to learn football. It is still very complex for me, but I already know the basic rules so maybe I could attend this season’s match to get involved in sports.”
Roth, who co-taught the class both semesters and will assist in training next semester’s instructors, said football was actually one of the most difficult subjects to teach.
“Explaining football and baseball is so incredibly difficult for someone who has never even seen a football,” she said. “It’s kind of realizing that you really have to start with the basics — things that you would never teach Americans, things that Americans just kind of know.”
Starting with the basics can mean explaining how to know if a girl likes you, describing why the Monica Lewinsky scandal was a big deal in the United States, negating Hollywood stereotypes or teaching that Americans don’t arrive late.
While former students of the American Culture Class appreciated this practical knowledge, many said what stood out more to them was the way the class approached larger topics — issues of communication, relationships and diversity — and the opportunity for dialogue.
“What impressed me most was this communication and this channel of sharing thoughts about the beginning of life as a foreign student in the U.S.,” Pedroso said.
Chen Chen, a graduate student studying strategic public relations from China, felt the same way.
“I cannot confidently say that I successfully transit myself into American culture,” Chen wrote in an e-mail. “To some extent, many of my Chinese friends have done a much better job than I do. However, I think the value of the class is to have a face-to-face communication to establish mutual understanding among people from different countries.”
While the students learn about diversity in America in one of the most diverse cities in the country, they also learn from the members of the class. Though most of the students come from Asian countries — which Pedroso said made her feel lonely at first — there is a varied representation of cultures.
“It’s a good spread that we have,” Peterson said. “China, Korea, India, Japan, Sri Lanka … just by the numbers we couldn’t have everybody represented but the interest was across the spectrum of our countries.”
Li said she felt the presence of different cultures allowed for a productive dialogue.
“I think it is a good way to communicate with people and to explain some things and maybe some conflicts to each other,” said Li. “The most useful thing I think is the diversity and we get to know what everybody thinks and to think this way we could minimize the conflicts between cultures.”
Both Roth and Peterson said they learned as much teaching the class as the students did.
“I’ve learned that apparently Americans do their laundry incorrectly,” Roth said. “I’ve learned that in China they don’t give out fortune cookies at the end of the meal. And then on a deeper level, I’ve learned how incredibly brave these students are for coming in from all over the world with a language barrier, without having friends or family around them, really to get an education to better themselves — usually so they can bring it back to their country, so they can better their country. And it’s something that I don’t think I would ever have the strength to do, and I just admire them so much. They really are inspiring people.”
The program will expand to three sections for the upcoming semesters — compared to one that was offered this year — to better accommodate the number of interested students. Though Roth and Peterson will not teach the class, they will train the new instructors, who will be graduate students and representatives of different departments at USC.
Peterson said the experience was inspiring.
“It’s incredibly, incredibly rewarding and beautiful,” she said. “You just step back and go: ‘That was cool.’”
