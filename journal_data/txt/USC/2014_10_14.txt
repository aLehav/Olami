On Wednesday, the student organization Startup Equinox will host the Startup Equinox Kickoff Event for all students interested in innovation.
Startup Equinox is tailored to meet the needs of students who are looking to pitch ideas and connect these ideas to fellow students, faculty and professionals who have successfully worked in entrepreneurial environments.
The event will have two parts. The first will start in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom before attendees are to be transported to the Viterbi Hacker House located on Adams Boulevard. The event is set to begin at 6:30 p.m.
Spencer Price, a member of the organization, said he has been looking forward to the event for weeks.
“The event will be a forum-style gathering where we expect to see hundreds of prospective entrepreneurs come together to listen, learn and network with one another to start turning ideas into realities,” Price said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The members of Startup Equinox have put together a group of speakers over the course of the event. Price said that the event will begin with a panel discussion featuring three speakers including Ron Miller, partner of StartEngine; James Bottom, project director of USC’s Blackstone LaunchPad; and Eytan Elbaz, co-founder of Scopely and head of domain channel at Google.
The president of Startup Equinox, Asher Genoot, said the speakers would discuss their experiences starting out in the tech industry.
“They will be focusing on one specific thing that they wish they would have known before starting out,” Genoot said.
The next part of the event will include five companies pitching ideas: three that are USC start-ups; one from Mike Jones, former CEO of Myspace; and the last from Elbaz.
Genoot said the main section of the event will take place after the five pitches.
“The primary purpose is to unite students together,” he said. “We want to pull back on great guest speakers and pull forward on having more students featured.”
Students will have the opportunity to present their pitches to the hundreds of attendees in the Campus Center Ballroom.
“The event’s main purpose — getting students involved and eager to collaborate — revolves around the 40 student fast-pitches which will be one minute each,” Price said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
During the event, student band The Neighbors will be performing and food will be served.
Once the event has concluded in the Campus Center, all attendees with an RSVP can take a chartered bus to the Viterbi Hacker House for refreshments with other students and networking with the speakers.
“We are really pushing our effort to work with other institutes on campus like the Hacker House and to create a friendly environment,” Genoot said.
Genoot said the goal of Startup Equinox is to bring students together to create a community geared toward creating new ideas.
“The community here is very fragmented. You have Marshall stuck within Marshall, Viterbi stuck within Viterbi, Annenberg with Annenberg,” Genoot said. “In order to create a successful project or company, you have to have students that are from different backgrounds. We want to bring students together based on passions rather than background.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate met on Tuesday night to discuss budget allocations and hear presentations from leaders of Program Board committees.

Treasurer Julie Stripe presented the fall budget, which allocated nearly $200,000 to USG-sponsored student organizations.
According to Stripe, the Concerts Committee received $93,229.55 in funding to cover production and talent costs. Stripe explained that this budget increase is required in order to support sophisticated setups and book popular artists.
“This is an expense that we’ve historically seen go up,” Stripe said. “In order for Concerts Committee to provide our students with the types of concerts they expect, we need to support them with our funds.”
The Senate voted unanimously to award $2,500 to the Environmental Student Assembly for its concert on Thursday night. The ESA will use the funds to finance a bicycle-powered stage.
“The [ESA’s] events will benefit the entire USC community,” Commuter Senator Hayden Smith said. “I would like to move forward with this project because I think this could be a springform for something bigger, such as powering the whole Springfest stage with bicycles.”
Senior Director of Communications Christie Hennes outlined her department’s social media strategy.
“We’ve actually increased our followers on Instagram by over 100 percent which is really exciting,” Hennes said. “We have done ‘Senator Spotlights’ on Tuesdays, ‘Trojan Throwbacks’ on Thursdays and are really trying to publicize the events we are doing on all of our platforms.”
Co-Director of External Relations Alana Victor discussed upcoming projects to increase student engagement with USG. External relations has partnered with the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion to encourage students to live healthier lifestyles.
“We hope to do things like hand out fruit on Trousdale [Parkway] for breakfast and increase awareness of dining options on campus other than those at Campus Center,” Victor said.
The Council of Presidents is another event that is in the works. Victor hopes to bring together the presidents of more than 800 student organizations to increase collaboration and inform student leaders about available funding from USG.
USG Vice President Rini Sampath concluded the meeting by sharing updates on her initiative to improve the housing process for spring admits. Sampath said the administration rejected a proposal to provide university housing for spring admits and that she is in talks with University Gateway Apartments.
“We met with Gateway hoping to get a floor sectioned off for spring admits,” Sampath said. “This seems like a really cool way to solve the problem of spring admit housing.”

USC is sponsoring the Society for Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science’s annual national conference, “Creativity, Vision, & Drive: Toward Full Representation in STEM,” from Oct. 16-18 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
SACNAS is a national organization comprised of scientists who are committed to the academic success of Hispanic, Chicano and Native American students, postdoctoral researchers and professionals in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
“At the beginning of each school year, we give all new incoming Hispanic students a planner of resources, and SACNAS is one of those resources,” said William N. Vela, director of El Centro Chicano. “The number of Latinos and Native Americans [in science] are underrepresented and programs like SACNAS give them more resources, role models and exposure to those fields.”
Since its founding in 1973, SACNAS has become a network of 25,000 members, partners and friends, according to its website. USC is home to one of two independent chapters in the Los Angeles community.
“SACNAS is the largest national organization that promotes STEM careers for underrepresented groups,” said Alexis Moreno, assistant vice dean of diversity and strategic initiatives at USC. “It started two years ago with the idea of getting students, from undergraduate to graduate to postdoctoral, and connecting them to national networks.”
According to Moreno, the university’s sponsorship of the event will enable undergraduates participating in the convention to meet USC faculty, students and administrators, as well as tour university science facilities such as the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations and the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island.
“It should be exciting,” Moreno said. “Thursday night there’ll be a welcome concert by [LA-based Chicano rock band] Quetzal and Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Steve Kay will be making remarks at Friday’s lunch.”
Beatriz “Abril” Lopez-Bermudez, a senior majoring in chemistry who hails from Mexico City, is a member of USC’s SACNAS chapter.
“SACNAS has been an important source of information,” she said. “I’ve become more knowledgeable about the resources offered to students in STEM majors.”
Her principal investigator, chemistry professor Brent Melot, introduced her to the organization.
“He explained that it would be a great idea for me to be part of it and participate in their conference this year,” Lopez-Bermudez said.
Lopez-Bermudez plans to present a paper that she and her mentors worked on entitled “Dependence of the Li-Ion Conductivity and Activation Energies on the Crystal Structure and Ionic Radii in Li6MLa2Ta2O12.”
“Since this is my very first conference, I am really looking forward to meeting people in the field of chemistry and energy, as well as to present what we’ve been working on in lab,” Lopez-Bermudez said. “I want to make both my mentors and my school proud.”
Vela believes USC’s involvement in SACNAS offers a promising future for its minority students.
“I think it’s a great thing that USC has decided to take the lead on this,” Vela said. “In addition to the groups like Latinos and Native Americans, there are some groups within those groups that are even smaller in number, like Latina women, and I would think that to have any national organization geared specifically towards them really brings pride to those students and gives them a sense of belonging.”

Matthew Dowd, ABC News political correspondent and campaign strategist, came to speak with Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences professor and former political consultant Bob Shrum on Tuesday as part of the Department of Political Science’s Political Conversations series on Tuesday.

Shrum has worked on campaigns including the Gore-Lieberman and Kerry-Edwards presidential campaigns.
Dowd, who worked as a chief strategist on the 2004 Bush-Cheney presidential campaign and the 2006 Schwarzenegger California gubernatorial re-election campaign, took part in a conversation titled “The Loss of Trust and the Future of America.”
The event began with Shrum asking Dowd questions about the current political landscape before opening the room up to questions from the audience.
Shrum, a friend of Dowd’s despite their work for opposing parties, began his questioning on the topic of trust in American institutions.
“I think we are at a point of time where the loss of trust is at the lowest point it has been,” Dowd said. “Every institution in the country has lost trust simultaneously.”
He described how this loss of trust is not limited solely to the government and bureaucracy. According to Dowd, this distrust has also extended to corporate institutions that are now seen as being more interested in profit than the welfare of their employees. He said that mistrust has risen even in the world of sports, where recent performance enhancement allegations are leaving the populace wondering who they can trust.
“I think we are at a very traumatic time,” Dowd said. “There are a lot of people struggling with where [they] belong. I think in [this time] it’s a great opportunity if leaders emerge in the right way.”
Moving forward to the upcoming 2014 midterm elections and 2016 presidential election, Dowd felt that the candidate who wins, regardless of party, needs to actively work to impact change in the government.
“The country wants someone to emerge,” he said. “People want a leader of the country and then leader of the party far down the list. It’s time to make some transformational change in the way the country is run.”
Regardless of whether the Republicans or Democrats win the midterms, Dowd said he fears that the two parties will misinterpret the victory as Americans being in support of where their party is headed in a time when both parties have historically low approval ratings. He describes the Republican Party as “a Mad Men party in a Modern Family world” and the Democratic Party as having to overcome the president’s poor approval rating.
Identifying himself as an independent, Dowd identified polarization as a serious issue in American politics today, saying that 30 years ago, 75 percent of people were likely to live next door to someone of a different political affiliation — today, this is only true for 25 percent of people. He partially attributes this to the growth of media.
“It’s much easier to confirm our beliefs,” he said. “We are uncomfortable with information that might prove we are wrong.”
Dowd also described his experience working closely with President George W. Bush.  He also said that Bush’s presidency was quickly disrupted by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Dowd had been asked by the White House to conduct polling on Sept. 10, 2001, to see how the American populace was feeling about domestic and economic policy, and he was asked to fly out to Washington, D.C. on Sept. 11 to brief the White House on his findings.
“There was not a single question about foreign policy mentioned in the poll,” Dowd said.
According to Dowd, that changed with the involvement of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who took on a greater role in managing White House policy after the 9/11 attacks.
“The Vice President didn’t care much about domestic issues. He either wouldn’t come to the meetings or didn’t participate,” Dowd said. “That changed on Sept. 11.”
Dowd said Cheney became much more involved in White House affairs due to his past experience in foreign policy. Dowd described the former Vice President’s interests as “not bipartisan.”
Following how the country has shifted with both the Bush and Obama presidencies, Dowd said that the most important factor in the next presidential election is finding an effective leader.
“Ultimately presidential and national elections are about big values,” he said. “We want someone who is strong and has a sense of community.”
community.”

Single young adults are continuously in search of companionship. According to Steve Yoder of thefiscaltimes.com, online dating is a $2 billion industry with almost 3,900 companies running dating sites. Finding the right one seems hard these days, but whether you do it through online dating or you take a more traditional route, it can be incredibly rewarding to find “the one.” That individual’s ability to meet our needs varies depending on which stage of life you’re in. In college, at least, it seems most of us are seeking either an emotional or sexual connection.
Honesty is key · The most important thing for a quality, long-lasting relationship is an honest and truthful rapport with one’s significant other. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
So how do you begin? Most relationships begin with sheer physical attraction. Some college students limit their romantic life to just hookups, and that’s fine — provided both participants have the same agenda. If you’re looking for that lasting emotional connection, however, then you might need to ask yourself some very basic, but often difficult, questions.
Do you want someone to compliment you, or do you need someone to pull you out of an emotional hole? The latter immediately indicates a dependency on someone. If you are the one always giving, calling, texting and waiting on what they determine how your day or evening is going to be, the relationship might not end well. Despite what anyone says, you can’t force someone to be into you, nor can you force yourself to be attracted to that person.
Ideally, when you enter a relationship, you incorporate your new significant other into your already stable world. You want to share your whole being with them, but you don’t necessarily need to. If you are in search of someone to fill a void, they will be unable to accomplish that goal. The only person that can make you feel “complete” is yourself, you must do that before you enter a relationship.
The next important question to ask yourself is what you do not want. What personality traits can you not live with? My mother always says a leopard’s spots don’t change — they can fade, but they don’t entirely go away. This is really about knowing yourself, which isn’t very easy during this stage in our lives when we are constantly changing majors and personal styles. So start small and make a list about the traits you love about yourself, first. Your secondary list about the traits you hate should certainly correlate with your first list in an opposing way. Your list should evolve from month to month as you continue to grow, but in the meantime, you’ll know sooner rather than later if it’s time to get out of your present relationship. Whatever you do, don’t settle — being in a relationship built on compromised standards only builds resentment between both parties.
Now dig really deep. What are your core values and beliefs, and do you expect the same thing out of your partner? Is their emphasis on truthfulness and honesty the same as yours? This is without a doubt what can bring down the best of friends or the greatest of lovers. Religion can play a factor in this self-inspection, but religion usually doesn’t come into play until you’re closing in on a life together, so it is okay to date out of your comfort zone. For others, however, it might be all about who their partner is in the not-so-visible areas, like principles and character. What else is carved in stone for you? Is it finances, family traditions or political beliefs?
One of the biggest relationship deal-breakers is work ethic. Do you both strive to be the best you can be? Do you both work hard at your respective job? In the end, a go-getter will be unable to deal with a partner who is not one. So be forward with where you see yourself in the future. That doesn’t mean you mention them in your future, but let them know that you are not stopping until you have accomplished your goals. Effective and open communication about career goals and accomplishments is the only way a relationship can flourish. You need to just put it out there; if it doesn’t end well and they do not appreciate your drive for success, they might not be right for you. They should want to tell the whole world of your successes — not try to put them down. With all that being said, sometimes people need a wake-up call, and seeing that they might lose that special someone might be the thing that makes them realize their mistakes.
Lastly, what does your new love bring to the table? Do they make you a better person? Have they expanded your world? Do they challenge you to be a better you? Do they pick you up when you’re down? Do they support you in your endeavors? Do you laugh when you’re together? Are they willing to watch your kind of movie? Are you with each another for the right reasons or does someone have a hidden agenda? Do they talk to friends about you when you’re in a disagreement? I believe the last occurence happens frequently in the early relationships but should be a non-issue as your relationship grows.
Even with all of these questions, you must ask yourself one of the most important questions. Does just the thought of them make you smile?
A relationship can be a great source of inspiration, but not all are right. When a relationship works, though — and there are plenty that do — it can be an incredibly rewarding experience with a possible lifetime of happiness. Like most things worth having in life, however, it takes maturity, wisdom and patience to do correctly.

It is only Fitz Tepper’s junior year as a business administration major at USC, but his restaurant deal-scoring app, OffPeak, has already reached thrifty food lovers across the country. An idea conceived in its earliest form back in 2010, OffPeak came to be one of the first apps made for The Haverford School, Tepper’s high school in his hometown of Philadelphia. In collaboration with friend and OffPeak co-founder Max Whitehead, Tepper sought to bring convenience to his high school’s dining experience, an idea that has risen to popularity on the USC campus and is now preparing to go national.
Long time coming · Tepper has been working on incarnations of OffPeak since high school. When he came to USC, he adapted and expanded the technology to fit a larger, more complex campus food scene. – Photo courtesy of OffPeak
 
OffPeak went through many stages of growth before becoming the app that many USC students use today. Tepper and Whitehead initially intended for the project to offer a small-scale convenience to students at The Haverford School by making the daily lunch menu smartphone-accessible, a project which was continued at USC during Tepper’s freshman year in the form of the app Eat at USC. Dining hall menus were made available to students on campus so they could know what to expect prior to waiting in a lunch or dinner line.
It did not take Tepper’s simple-but-useful idea long to spread off campus. Eat at Penn provided the same features to students at the University of Pennsylvania, and it was then that Tepper saw how big of a role food plays in the lives of college students.
From this came OffPeak, a service that allows students to receive dining discounts at local eateries during certain hours of each day. Typically, these discounts are available for use at a restaurant’s off-peak hours, hence the app’s name. For most restaurants, this will often be during the morning hours or after 7 in the evening. For USC students, a popular offer is the buy one sub, get one half off deal at Subway.
At USC, OffPeak has garnered a following with both students and businesses for a few key reasons.
“First, students love us for some pretty obvious reasons — there is literally no other platform where you could walk into a franchise as large as Subway right now and get a buy one get one free sub … end of story,” Tepper said.
But in spite of the positive feedback OffPeak might receive from students, there is another group that might even appreciate the app more: restaurants.
“Restaurants love us because we aren’t a deal company. We only make money if they do. With Groupon, 44 percent of restaurants lose money, and most do not choose to use it a second time,” Tepper said.
OffPeak is able to support local restaurants because the app only profits when a restaurant does. There is no fee for being included on the app, so if OffPeak doesn’t bring business to a certain restaurant, it doesn’t have to worry about losing money. This satisfaction from restaurants keeps the app up and running, and the app, in turn, goes on to support the restaurants it lists.
As of now, OffPeak is working on adding new featured restaurants every week. Some of the currently offered restaurants most popular with students include Subway, 901 Bar & Grill and Bella Pita. Tepper also revealed that an Indian restaurant will be added soon.
On top of the addition of more businesses, OffPeak recently also took on a more socially interactive feature. The app has adopted a sort of newsfeed comparable to that of Venmo’s, so users can now see what deals their friends are cashing in on. To make thrifty eating even more fun, OffPeak holds a monthly contest in which the top three users win a cash prize.
After proving its success here at University Park, the app is now preparing to make big entrances on campuses across the country. As both Tepper and Whitehead were raised in Philadelphia, the next OffPeak campus will be the University of Pennsylvania.
In their expansion goals, the two students are tapping into their high school network, which is comprised of students who attend universities across the country. As of now, the next colleges OffPeak will reach after Penn  are UCLA and Georgetown University.
Tepper cites both his family and his classes at the Marshall School of Business for preparing him to take on this project. His family in Philadelphia owned a restaurant and had always been involved in the hospitality industry.
“There was really no question with what I was going to do in college. I knew I would go on to study business,” Tepper said.
From a young age, Tepper had always been interested in technology and cites that interest as a reason for coming to the West Coast for college. In terms of his Marshall classes, he attributed his professional selling class for giving him hands-on training to pursue a project like OffPeak on the side.

The formation of a musical super group never fails to make headlines, but immediate critical acclaim and continuing success are not things that tend to follow. Vancouver’s proud exceptions, The New Pornographers, released their sixth studio album, Brill Bruisers, in late August, resulting in the group’s first top-15 position on the Billboard charts.
Man in charge · A.C. Newman, the band’s frontman, has final say on which songs finally make the record. The other bandmates provide input, but Newman emphasizes that he retains the power to make final decisions. – Photo courtesy of The New Pornographers
 
Largely responsible for the band’s eminence is frontman A.C. Newman, the director for the group both in the studio and on the stage. This time around, he wanted to ensure that all the songs on the record were suitable to be performed in front of a live audience and mixed in with a healthy amount of older material.
“With most of our records there’s at least a few songs we just can’t play live. But we changed that. Now everything gets played live,” Newman said. “You want to mix up old songs and new songs. So for me it’s a little complicated, and it’s this math problem I have to figure out. And I just try to figure out how to play at least a couple songs from every record.”
Incorporating songs from the group’s whole discography is no compromise for the fans; Blender included The New Pornographers’ debut, Mass Romantic, among its top 25 best Indie-Rock albums of all time, and Rolling Stone ranked the band’s second album, Electric Version, among the top 80 best albums of the 2000s.
Newman said that the new album is the best work he’s completed so far, and luckily, the sessions for Brill Bruisers produced plenty of material. What is next for the frames of songs that didn’t make the cut, however, is undecided.
“If I don’t think a song is working, I’ll listen to it and think, ‘This part is great; I’ll keep this part and toss the rest,’” he said. “There’s not really any method to it. I try not to worry too much about the songs that don’t get finished. I feel like if they’re good enough, they’ll see the light of day eventually.”
Members Dan Bejar and Neko Case have successful solo careers of their own as well, so balancing the input of the rest of the band has become a delicate task for Newman. When choosing the final tracklist for an album, he takes input from everyone. Sometimes people say to me, ‘I don’t know about putting that song on the record,’ and I’ll listen to them and think, ‘Yeah, maybe you’re right,” he said. “Sometimes I agree with them and say, ‘Yeah, let’s take that off the record,’ and sometimes I go, ‘No, you’re completely wrong, it has to be on the record.” Despite the admission that the decision ultimately comes down to him, Newman tries to keep a jovial mood about the entire process. “I try not to be megalomaniacal about the whole thing,” he said.
The group’s comfortable dynamic and success amid contemporary independent music makes them an excellent fit at their record label, Matador. They’re among good company within the catalog, which includes Yo La Tengo, Belle and Sebastian, Thurston Moore and Pavement.
“The ties to Matador and [Parent Company] Beggars are pretty deep,” said Newman, who is also on Matador as a solo artist. ”They’re all friends that go way back. I’ve always felt lucky to be on Matador because it was my No. 1 choice. If you’d asked me in 2000 what label I’d want to be on, I would have said Matador. And then by some stroke of luck, they were the label that chose us.”
Fans already looking to see what comes after their current  tour will not have to wait very long.
“I think I would go back and make a new record. In fact, I’m feeling the urge to start working on the next record,” Newman said. “There is a dream that maybe we would do some recording on the bus this tour, we’ll see if that happens.” His hunger to keep creating new material is insatiable, and he has plenty of material saved away to work on and release soon.
“There are a few songs I would like to finish still,” he said. “There are a few songs that didn’t make the record that are very close to being done and I’d like to take a whack at them and see if we can finish them.”
The New Pornographers will be at Pappy and Harriet’s by Joshua Tree on Wednesday and at the Wiltern in Los Angeles on Friday. The band’s complicated touring schedule makes them a rare act to see — and one that shouldn’t be missed.

The Trojan football team once again sits atop the Pac-12 South following a too-close-for-comfort 28-26 win over the Arizona Wildcats this past Saturday. USC (4-2, 3-1 Pac-12) looks to build on this momentum moving toward Saturday’s matchup at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum against the ailing Colorado Buffaloes (2-4, 0-3).
Shoulder the load · Junior defensive end Leonard Williams, who had two sacks at Arizona, rested his shoulder in practice on Tuesday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Explosive Playing
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian has stressed for a few weeks the importance of executing more big plays. Saturday’s game at Arizona was an improvement in that category, yet the Trojans still only had 424 yards of total offense, almost 50 yards fewer than Arizona had.
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler threw for just 185 yards (down from his average of 276.0 heading into the game) and tossed his first pick of the season.
Redshirt junior wide receiver George Farmer discussed the team’s high-caliber plays.
“We did pretty good — there are some areas we need to clean up, and we can take some more shots,” said Farmer, who was one of five scholarship receivers the Trojans played on Saturday.
The Trojans are playing a Colorado squad that has a reputation for giving up big plays down the field — the Colorado defense is averaging 12.9 yards given up per completion.
Meanwhile, the Buffaloes’ run defense has allowed a conference-worst 5.0 yards per carry, which USC’s running backs will look the exploit on Saturday.
Sophomore tailback Justin Davis saw some game action backing up redshirt junior Javorius “Buck” Allen on Saturday and hopes to see more this weekend. Allen had 205 yards on 26 carries, and Davis ran for 28 yards on seven carries. Davis spoke of Allen as a great leader and role model for him.
Allen, who leads the Pac-12 with 781 rush yards in seven games so far this season, has been receiving high praise from the coaching staff, even garnering a comparison to rookie Tennessee Titans running back Bishop Sankey, whom Sarkisian coached at Washington. Allen and Davis will play critical roles in the rest of the season especially as the Trojans attempt to jump-start their pass offense with a solid run game.
South is Stacked
The Pac-12 currently has six teams ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. With half of the teams in the Top 25, it is no surprise that there have been so many upsets.
Home teams in conference play are 4-14, which is a surprising statistic that the Trojans have fallen victim to, in losing to Arizona State at the Coliseum two weeks ago.
Sarkisian stressed the importance of focusing on both the mental and physical aspects of the upcoming divisional matchup against the Buffaloes.
“In our conference, if you don’t come ready to play, whether home or away, you will get beat,” Sarkisian said.
Sarkisian revealed a snippet of his game plan moving forward for having success in the talented Pac-12 conference.
“We have to learn from the last few weeks,” Sarkisian said. “We need to remain more aggressive.”
The Buffaloes are winless in conference play, but the Trojans are not underestimating any conference opponents.
“Every week is a championship game.” Davis said. “It’s cool to control your own destiny, have it in your hands, and we can’t let that go. We have to play every game like it’s our last.”
Injury Report
Junior defensive end Leonard Williams sat out of practice on Tuesday to rest a shoulder that was bothering him from Saturday’s game.
True freshman wide receiver-cornerback Adoree’ Jackson also missed Tuesday’s practice due to a hip flexor injury. Sarkisian was unable to say on Tuesday what their status would be later in the week but expressed  optimism that both players would continue healing.

They’re two of the greatest postgame interviews of all-time. Though they hold about equal places in sports lore for their respective amounts of humor, they represent completely opposite sentiments.
The first is with former NFL coach Jim E. Mora (not to be confused with his son and current UCLA coach Jim L. Mora) after a particularly disappointing regular season loss with the Indianapolis Colts.
“Playoffs?! Don’t talk about playoffs! You kidding me? Playoffs?! I just hope we can win a game!”
The second is from former Boston Celtics forward Kevin Garnett after the Celtics won the NBA title in 2008.
“Anything is possible. Anything is possible!”
I can’t decide which of these feelings I’m most aligning with after USC’s win against Arizona this weekend. I want to say it’s possible for USC to make the four-team playoff at the end of the year, but part of me thinks it’s ridiculous to even think about that at this point.
Garnett isn’t exactly right in his assertion on probability. Obviously, there are plenty of things in sports that literally are not possible given what we know about physical limitations to the human body. But it wouldn’t be a cliché if there wasn’t some truth to it, and the sports world reminds us just about every week that highly, highly unlikely things happen all the time.
For example, if USC is down by 28 with 30 seconds, it truly is impossible for the Trojans to hypothetically come back. There is simply not enough time to run down the field for a touchdown four times even if the special teams unit rattled off three successful onside kicks. But if USC was down 40 points at halftime, the Trojans hypothetically could score three touchdowns each of the next two quarters and win, and that kind of stuff has happened before.
So with two losses, six remaining games and 18 teams in the AP poll between the last playoff spot, is it still possible for USC to make the playoff? Let’s draw up the least ridiculous scenario in which the No. 22 Trojans finish the regular season as the fourth-ranked team in the country.
This scenario hinges on maybe the most unlikely of the following possibilities: USC finishing the season with just two losses. I don’t think that will happen, but the Trojans could beat all six of the remaining teams on their schedule.
If that did happen, it still wouldn’t guarantee a top-four finish, and the Trojans will have to root for a lot of the other ranked teams to lose. But these Top 25 teams hit each other enough times that a two-loss ’SC team could jump them in the rankings (I don’t even want to think about how ridiculous the scenario would have to be for a three-loss ’SC team to make it…).
The most important game this weekend for the Trojans — besides the Colorado game, of course — is the No. 5 Notre Dame vs. No. 2 Florida State game. As much as any longtime fan might hate it, we all must swallow our pride and root as hard as we can for the rival Fighting Irish to upset the defending national champions. Notre Dame could jump to the top spot in the nation with a win, and I can’t imagine the Irish being any lower than No. 2 going into the last game of the season if they remain undefeated.
That last game of the season, of course, is when Notre Dame comes to the Coliseum, and an upset for the Trojans in that game would be monumental. Beating a team like that would validate USC as one of the best teams in the nation, but Notre Dame has to be undefeated for that game to really matter.
No. 9 Oregon is the next team that USC really needs to go undefeated the rest of the way. The Ducks still need to get past No. 23 Stanford, but I think they will en route to winning the Pac-12 North and will finish near the Top 5. If USC can follow an upset win over Notre Dame with a victory against Oregon in the Pac-12 championship game, USC finishing in the Top 4 starts looking like a legitimate possibility.
The Trojans first have to get to the Pac-12 title game, and that involves someone beating Arizona State in conference play. Whether it be Stanford this weekend, No. 20 Utah on Nov. 1 or No. 16 Arizona on the final weekend, ASU needs a second conference loss.
Because the Sun Devils would have the head-to-head advantage in the Pac-12 South standings over the Trojans — we don’t have to talk about the Hail Mary anymore — if both teams finished with one loss, the Trojans need someone else to punch their ticket for a crucial date with Oregon in the Pac-12 final.
But winning your conference only guarantees you a spot in the playoff if you happen to play in the SEC. One day, I think a system of automatic qualifiers for each conference will replace arbitrary rankings to determine playoff seeding. But the uncertainty of the current system actually makes for a very exciting avenue for fans and sportswriters to speculate.
No. 1 Mississippi State goes undefeated. That gives No. 7 Alabama a second loss and No. 3 Ole Miss a loss. If No. 6 Auburn beats Ole Miss but loses to Alabama, and Mississippi State beats No. 10 Georgia in the SEC title game, that gives everyone but Mississippi State two loses in the SEC.
No. 4 Baylor goes undefeated. That gives everybody else in the Big 12 two losses if No. 15 Oklahoma State can beat No. 12 TCU.
Now someone between the ACC winner and the Big Ten winner has to miss out on the Final Four. And nobody else from those conferences gets in. If Florida State wins everything except the Notre Dame game, the Seminoles are the only team making noise out of the ACC. That should be enough for the playoff. The winner of Ohio State vs. Michigan State should win the Big Ten with only one loss. Even if Michigan State comes out of the Big Ten and the Spartans’ one loss is to the Pac-12 against Oregon, the strength-of-schedule argument won’t matter as much as the better record.
So a two-loss USC team’s hopes rest on another bitter enemy.
Boston College needs to upset Florida State and give the Seminoles a second loss.
Throw in that upset, and USC makes the top four with Mississippi State, Baylor and Michigan State.
Verdict? Highly unlikely. The polls would have to weigh USC’s meteoric second half rise — which, again, still has to actually happen, by the way — very highly because a two-loss SEC team and a one-loss Notre Dame team might still be ranked higher than a two-loss USC team, even if Notre Dame’s one loss was to USC.
But possible.

Many freshmen in college are worried about adjusting to college life and managing classes and newfound independence, but  redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne has faced an especially interesting situation since graduating from high school a semester early and enrolling at USC in January of 2013. Unlike his peers, Browne was saddled with the additional adjustments caused by the many coaching changes and quarterback competitions USC football has seen in Browne’s less-than-two-year tenure.
Rising star · Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne, a five-star recruit in 2013, has played in two games for USC this season, in which he looked fully capable of carrying the Trojans in the years to come. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
Browne attended Skyline High School in Sammamish, Wash., where he won two championships with his team, acting as the starting quarterback his junior and senior seasons.
In 2012, he was named the Gatorade National High School Player of the Year. Browne followed in the footsteps of his older brother, Mitch, who won a state championship for Skyline in 2000.
Browne was five years old when his brother won the state championship, and it was then that Browne decided he wanted to play football.
“I have three older brothers, and my oldest brother won a state championship for my high school in 2000. I was five years old, and I just kind of took a liking to that,” Browne said. “I played other sports, but football was probably the thing I was best at. My brothers and my dad got me hooked on it early.”
Once Browne started playing football in third grade, there was never any doubt in his mind what position he would play.
“I always knew I wanted to play quarterback,” Browne said. “I really haven’t played a single different position since third grade. I’ve always been quarterback. I like being in control and having the ball in my hands every play. I had some success at it so over the years that’s where I found myself.”
Even though his brothers and his dad were the ones who sparked Browne’s interest in football, he’s the first in his family to play football at a Division I school, as his brother Mitch played at Claremont McKenna. When deciding which school to attend, Browne narrowed his options down to offers from USC, Alabama, Oklahoma and Washington.
“I decided I wanted to go here to get this degree, live in L.A., play in the Pac-12, a conference that I grew up following, and the quarterback tradition here just seemed like the perfect fit,” Browne said. “I looked at the full picture — the degree here, the other factors outside of football — and I decided this should be my home.”
Despite speculation that Browne would look to transfer after losing the quarterback battle to redshirt junior Cody Kessler, he is adamant that he never doubted his place at USC.
“In the real world of college football now, if you lose a competition battle, most guys transfer,” Browne said. “I knew getting recruited that it was a possibility that I would get beat out, but I never want to transfer, and a big reason why is this degree and my teammates, and I’ve never second guessed it.”
Browne is a communication major with an entrepreneurship minor. He is on pace to earn his degree in only three years, graduating next December. After he graduates, Browne hopes to attend graduate school at USC. If football doesn’t pan out as a career, Browne still wants to be involved in sports.
“I’d love to be an announcer of some sort,” Browne said. “I’d love to announce games and stuff. I could see myself being a coach, but I’m not sure that’s necessarily what I’d want to do. I’d love to work for ESPN.”
Outside of football, Browne admits that he enjoys being an average college student playing video games like FIFA and Madden, and spending time with friends. He also played basketball in high school, but stopped due to the risk of injury when he started getting heavily recruited for football. He enjoys following his favorite teams, the Seahawks and Mariners, and admits that he is a bandwagon LeBron James fan.
Browne hopes that after USC, he goes on to play in the NFL like some of his role models: Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady.
“I want to be a premier quarterback in the NFL,” Browne said. “That’s a big reason why I came here. Obviously, that’s a big goal to shoot for, but I wanna be one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. That’s my goal, and it’s what I strive and work for every day.”
Looking forward to seeing Max play “PERIOD” !
No offense to Kessler !!
Max Browne will take the Trojans to a NCAA Championship !
Starting in 2015…
FightOn 
Looking forward to seeing Max in the game this weekend.

Though it is well known that women are often underappreciated and undervalued in the work force, the prejudice is greater in some professions than others. In engineering and tech jobs, the lack of respect, equal pay and credit given to women is particularly problematic.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s gaffe earlier this week confirms this discriminatory mindset even among leaders in the field. At a conference for women in technology, Nadella responded to a question on what he would tell women who are hesitant to ask for a raise by saying, “It’s not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along. And that, I think, might be one of the additional superpowers that quite frankly women who don’t ask for a raise have.”
Nadella then continued to say that it is “good karma” to be this way as a woman in the workforce and that he would trust such a person over those who expect or demand raises. This discriminatory attitude against women emphasizes the struggle that women in technology have had and continue to have for gender equality.
Since entering the workforce, especially in jobs within the tech world, women have been undervalued and often even forgotten. According to NPR, Jean Jennings Bartik and five other female mathematicians were some of the first people who worked on programs for one of the world’s first fully electronic general-purpose computers because, as NPR reported, “men didn’t think it was an important job.” At the time, however, the press didn’t identify these women, and they were lost and forgotten despite their incredible contribution to the age of technology.
The stereotypes associated with women in the tech force have also led to many women completely leaving science industries. According to another NPR piece, women tend to drop out faster than men in these educational fields.
In fact, in various studies done in classrooms, if women were reminded of the stereotype that men are better than them at math, their performance dropped dramatically. Psychologists call this “stereotype threat.” With this constant “threat” looming, women tend to monitor their conversations, worried that they might not say the right things or sound stupid and because of this fear, they just seem more incompetent. This effect is not seen, however, when women are talking to other women — only when women are talking to men.
The lack of women pursuing engineering degrees is astounding as well. According to Brian L. Yoder, director of assessment, evaluation and institutional research at the American Society for Engineering Education, statistics show that women earned only about 18.4 percent of bachelor’s engineering degrees in 2011, 22.6 percent of master’s degrees and 21.8 percent of doctoral degrees. Women need to take more part in the evolution of science by increasing these numbers.
The issue of dealing with such stereotypes has become a serious problem in the workplace. Nadella apologized, tweeting, ”Was inarticulate re how women should ask for raise. Our industry must close gender pay gap so a raise is not needed because of a bias.” He also wrote a letter to employees expressing remorse, saying, “Men and women should get equal pay for equal work … If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.” Though Nadella apologized for his misogynistic comments to both the public and his employees, the damage has already been done. The apology was heartfelt, but the fact that the sexism was justified in some way, whether inadvertently or not, adds to the discrimination that accompanies women’s roles in the technological work place. With such acknowledgements and the reality of the jarring differences between men and women in the tech world, both in terms of salary and respect afforded to them, action must be taken. Increased recruitment of women for such jobs might help the colossal differences between women and men. Even more incentives for women to excel in such jobs, which would enhance the idea of encouragement and perhaps destroy the “stereotype threat,” could be part of a great solution.
Both men and women need to work toward women being treated equally in the tech world, both financially and psychologically. Without such women, programs for the very first computer might never have existed. And, without the highly intelligent women that have fought so hard against such stereotypes by excelling in technological fields, our world might very well have been different. If we can learn to support women in the tech world, who knows what both men and women might come up with to further our society?

Though the recent L.A. heat wave might not indicate it, Halloween is just around the corner. Local stores have already stocked up on all the essential seasonal items — candy, spooky decorations and, of course, Halloween costumes. For women, it seems like the possibilities are limitless: Greek goddess, flapper, princess, athlete, angel, vampire — the list goes on.
Alana Grayson | Daily Trojan
 
The only catch is that nearly every costume intended for women is either explicitly labeled “sexy” or reveals more skin, seeming to indicate that sexualizing women is the seasonal norm. Whether a woman chooses to dress in more clothing or less is not the issue. The real problem is the female objectification that occurs during this time of year and its many negative side effects.
A huge part of the problem is that this seasonal sexism is so ingrained in our culture that it’s easy to overlook. In Mean Girls — arguably one of this generation’s most popular comedy films — the main character observes, “Halloween is the one day a year when a girl can dress up like a total slut and no other girls can say anything else about it.” Of course, the comedy of this statement lies in its frank but accurate depiction of Halloween in the 21st century. In fact, many websites feature articles offering alternatives to the typical “sexy” costume. The title of a recent Huffington Post article says it all: “Halloween Costumes for Women Who Don’t Want to be Sexy Cops or School Girls.” The list is prefaced with a brief introduction, assuring readers that they “don’t have to settle for a ‘sexy,’ ‘naughty,’ garden-variety Halloween costume[s].” Of course, there is nothing blatantly amoral about the Huffington Post article or its clever ideas. Still, popular media sources like Huffington Post and websites like “Take Back Halloween!” display a need to pin non-“sexy” costumes as alternatives, showing the prevalence of sexualized female costumes.
The problem with “sexy” Halloween costumes also transcends unoriginality. The dominance of racy female costumes reveals the underlying sexism fueling this trend. In a 2013 Daily Orange article, Laura Cohen, a student at Syracuse University, remarked that the “market hardly allows [for other options]. The costumes available for women are mainly oversexualized, featuring short skirts and low-cut tops.” This is a predominantly female trend, however. A quick perusal of Party City’s website is enough to prove that the ratio of “sexy” female costumes to “sexy” male costumes is alarmingly high. In 2013, the Huffington Post featured an article entitled “Cal Consent Campaign Posters Remind You Halloween Costumes Aren’t An Excuse To Be Rapey.” While the campaign’s goal of consent awareness is admirable, only one image included in the article depicts a male body. This says a great deal about modern culture; the only reason for the posters to depict more women than men would be if this were an issue of sexism.
And yet, the biggest problem with “sexy” costumes is that many counterarguments only add fuel to the fire. The idea that women should not dress a certain way because they might invite sexual assault just paves the way for victim-blaming — the idea that women are responsible when they are raped. Worst of all are critics who do not present a solid argument whatsoever, instead choosing to refer to women in revealing costumes as “sluts.” In the words of Cohen, labeling women as “slutty,” during Halloween or any other time of the year, “reinforces ideologies that harm women and does not move us any closer toward gender equality.” Even someone who advocates against sexualizing women during Halloween adds to the problem when he or she uses the term “slut” to illustrate their point. Someone’s worth as a person should not hinge on his or her sex appeal in any way; the use of this word degrades the subject and paves the way for the dehumanization of women in general.
Essentially, the problem with “sexy” costumes lies not in one particular costume or style but in the sexism surrounding the entire trend. If someone chooses to wear a “revealing” costume, so be it. As Cohen points out, “We do not need to strip all racy Halloween costumes from stores’ shelves, nor should we shame women who want to wear them.” A greater selection of costumes for women might help the problem, but the greatest issue is the mindset surrounding this holiday.
Women are not sexual objects. They should not be afraid to feel too conservative or too sexy based on their choice of apparel, nor should they be afraid that their body is inadequate or that their costumes are invitations for rape. What Halloween needs is a new level of female respect.
 
Superman, Spiderman, Wolverine…almost any male character suitable as a Halloween costume choice for guys rocks the 6 pack abs that most guys do not have. Yet you will find the pudgy superheros as well as the yoked out guys because first and foremost, Halloween should be about having fun – not another moment to stand on a soapbox and become sanctimonious and preachy… Sexy costumes exist for one and one reason only – they sell! And guess who’s buying them! People who want them! 
““Halloween is the one day a year when a girl can dress up like a total slut and no other girls can say anything else about it.” — yeah right – like girls refrain from passing judgement just because it is Halloween – what a joke.
BTW – let’s not pretend this “huge” problem of sexism exists only on Oct 31st. There are plenty of tight t-shirt under-boob and tight yoga pants butt shots all year long. Just walk along the Row on any Thursday night and there are plenty of exposed T&A for people to pretend to be self righteous about.
Jennifer has a point: The emphasis on “sexy” costumes for little girls is disgusting. Sadly, all too many moms buy these costumes. The bad news is that moms make it worthwhile for the manufacturers to sell such trash, and those companies are in business to sell and make a profit. (Yes, I doubt that dads buy such costumes.)
But here is the good news:  1)No mom is obliged to do this to a daughter; and 2)Most costumes and masks are not sexy little girl costumes. The choices of other costumes are broad. No need exists to make a little girl look like a sex object.
