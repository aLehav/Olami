Studio Ghibli is an illustrious Japanese animation studio that has given audiences magical cinematic moments such as the Oscar-winning film “Spirited Away,” “Princess Mononoke” and “My Neighbor Totoro.” Its latest film “Earwig and the Witch” made its premiere Oct. 18 in France at the Grand Lyon Film Festival and is set to broadcast in Japan in December. It is a children’s fantasy story, based on a book by Diana Wynne Jones. She also wrote the source material for another popular Ghibli movie, “Howl’s Moving Castle,” directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Although “Earwig and the Witch” has elements that fit within the identity of Studio Ghibli’s most famed films, its 3D animation style might stand out to those familiar with the animation studio’s other popular feature films. Moreover, it is directed by Gorou Miyazaki, a name you might be unfamiliar with. 
This is because Studio Ghibli’s highest-grossing films globally are all associated with one director, Hayao Miyazaki, who is often seen as representative of the studio. As a founder and having directed around half of the feature films put out by the studio, Miyazaki certainly merits this status. However, this leads to creating a homogenous identity built around a singular personality that is far from its reality as a 35-year-old animation studio built on the collaborative creative faculties of its varied creators. 
If you’re anticipating their latest project and want to explore the diverse cinematic voices of this historied animation studio, check out these four Studio Ghibli movies from four different directors who aren’t Hayao Miyazaki. In 2019, HBO Max acquired the rights to stream all of the Ghibli feature films, and since this service is free to USC students, you can watch all these movies right now! 
“From Up on Poppy Hill” (2011) 
Fueled by a sense of nostalgia with catchy pop songs scattered throughout, “From Up on Poppy Hill” paints an enthralling portrait of the port city Yokohama in the ’60s. This feature film is the second that Gorô Miyazaki has directed and his first collaboration with his father, Hayao, who wrote the screenplay. A period piece set in Yokohama before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the movie features a charmingly earnest romance that follows its protagonists, Shun Kazama (Jun’ichi Okada) and Umi Matsuzaki (Masami Nagasawa), in their attempt to save The Latin Quarter, an eccentric and quirky clubhouse at their high school. It is an endearing drama that uses its historical setting to explore the value of the past in an increasingly modernizing society, which is rather fitting as it is built on the collaboration of filmmakers from two distinct generations. 
“The Secret World of Arrietty” (2010)
There is something distinctly fascinating about seeing normal household items such as a clothespin or sellotape being recycled and repurposed by these four-inch tall Borrowers that sucks you into the intricately crafted tiny ecosystem. If you’re tired of being trapped indoors during the pandemic, this movie is perfect for you as it uses its magical realism to urge you to re-examine the surroundings you’ve taken for granted.
“The Secret World of Arrietty” is the directorial debut of Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who previously worked as a key animator on a number of Ghibli movies. The film uses its animation to create a sense of wonder out of the mundane.
The fantasy tale centers around a family of Borrowers, one of the last few remaining in the world, who survive on borrowed human-household goods and food and live under the floorboards of a fairly conventional suburban house. The protagonist is the youngest borrower Arrietty (Mirai Shida), who forms an unlikely and dangerous friendship with Shô (Ryûnosuke Kamiki), a boy who inhabits the household. Zooming into the nooks and crannies of the house, watching the Borrowers journey from the living room to the kitchen, is like viewing them traverse an intensely dangerous obstacle course.
“Whisper of the Heart” (1995) 
If you’re fond of tuning into “Lo-fi hip-hop radio” livestreams on YouTube, you might already be familiar with the protagonist of this movie, Shizuku Tsukishuma (Yoko Honna). The poster of this film, with its sprawling fantasy city and its protagonist flying in the sky with an anthropomorphic cat, is rather misleading. Unlike the grand-scale fantasy stories Studio Ghibli is known for, this coming-of-age narrative is grounded in reality. Yet, it will fill you with awe as you follow Shizuku’s discovery of a quaint antique store with a musical cuckoo clock and a mysterious old cat-doll which kick-starts her journey to actualize her passions as a young writer. Unfortunately, the creation of this hopeful movie is tinged with melancholy as its debutant director, Yoshifumi Kondô, passed away in 1998, a few years after its release.
Kondô worked as a character designer and animation supervisor for previous Ghibli movies. His prowess with detailed character animation shines in this movie’s attention to detail, which adds to its grounded tone. Be prepared to have “Country Roads” in your head as this film features three distinct renditions of it, embodying its ethos. 
“My Neighbours The Yamadas” (1999) 
With many universities going virtual this year due to the pandemic, a lot of students are finding themselves attending school from home and staying with their families. Familial relationships carry a wide range of emotional experiences, and this movie aims to capture that feeling. It is a slice-of-life film built around the eccentric middle-class Yamada family, living in Tokyo. Though the film does not have a connected storyline, it is a collection of light-hearted vignettes of family life. 
The director of this film, Isao Takahata, was also one of the founders of Studio Ghibli, who passed in 2018. It might seem unexpected that this simple collection of stories was one of the studio’s most experimental works of animation. It is their first fully digitally animated film, which disrupted the studio’s usual hand-drawn working conventions as Takahata wanted to create its distinctive watercolor visual style. On the one hand, the film is uniquely Japanese, offering you a glimpse into the Tokyo lifestyle, yet it simultaneously speaks to universal shared experiences.

A growing body of research studies the ways in which low self-esteem and negative views of body image and appearance disproportionately affect young women. This field of study is largely informed by the reality that, in many parts of the Western world, women are expected to maintain unrealistic beauty standards, and their worth is often heavily predicated on their adherence to these standards. In the context of this troubling dynamic, it is necessary to consider the cultural factors influencing one’s sense of self and their appearance, especially as it relates to race and ethnicity. 
As a young woman, I often struggled with issues regarding my appearance and self-worth. However, it was not until my later adolescence that I realized one of the main reasons I did not perceive myself to be attractive was likely the result of having seldom seen faces similar to mine represented or deemed beautiful in popular culture in the United States. 
Various industries and brands have begun to catch onto the increasingly clear message that representation matters. A 2019 article published by PBS reported that media portrayals affect not only how others perceive those in marginalized groups, but also how people in these groups in turn view themselves.
In the same article, PBS cited a report they conducted from their Student Reporting Labs, where they interviewed 144 high school students who agreed that the way they are represented (or not represented) in popular media can affect their mental health. 
For many, a lack of familiar faces in the media may indicate that society does not perceive a person like them to be attractive and arguably valued as well. This, in turn, can have deleterious effects on the wellbeing of young people, making them question their own sense of self-worth. 
However, this issue of diversity and representation across ethnic and racial groups within popular culture is a byproduct of an otherwise colonialist Western system that only deems Eurocentric features worthy of idealization. With this in mind, it’s important to consider how such ideals affect not only people within the U.S., but also those in countries that were colonized by the Western world. 
This past winter, I had the opportunity to travel to the Philippines and experience the life my father and his family had left when they immigrated to the U.S. While there, I soon came to realize that these same issues of beauty that I felt in the U.S. — where having darker skin and non-white features were seen as less conventionally attractive — are also present there. 
Skin whitening lotions, soaps, deodorants, clinics and pills flood department stores across the country. While the Philippines is not the only place in the world with a booming market for skin whitening products, it is estimated that one in every two Pilipinos have used skin whitening treatments. 
My family explained to me that the preference for all things “American,” such as fairer features and smaller noses, were the product of a colonial mentality — an internalized oppression experienced as the result of living in a post-colonial society. 
Scholars interested in the intersections of post-colonial studies and cultural psychology have often looked to Pilipino Americans as a group particularly affected by internalized oppression. According to E.J.R. David, associate professor of psychology at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, colonial mentality has been decisively linked to poorer mental health outcomes, including lower levels of self-esteem and life satisfaction paired with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
It’s also suggested that colonial mentality affects Pilipino Americans’ propensity to seek out mental health services. According to previous research David had published in 2010 in the Asian American Journal of Psychology, Pilipino Americans seek mental health services at a much lower rate compared to other Asian Americans and that a lower likelihood to seek professional help is related to cultural mistrust. 
The case study of Pilipino Americans only scratches the surface of the myriad ways in which racism and historical oppression have had destructive effects on the well-being of non-white ethnic groups. However, it is through this case study that we can begin to raise awareness of the ways in which social and racial justice cannot be separated from our efforts to understand and improve mental health. 
This research builds upon the growing demands to address and improve diversity and inclusion in media representation. Many advocates argue that increasing the number of Black and Indigenous people and people of color, LGBTQ+, disabled folks and other marginalized groups in the media helps reduce stereotypes and implicit biases deeply embedded in our society. 
I would argue, moreover, that addressing these systemic shortcomings also serves to begin rectifying the internalized maltreatment so many have suffered from not having been traditionally viewed as desirable and worthy. It is long overdue that the dire implications of colonial mentality as it relates to self-image and mental health are discussed.

The USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work launched a new social work and juvenile justice minor for Fall 2020, which covers 16 academic units and can be completed across the course of three semesters.
The minor’s curriculum is designed for students who are interested in broadening their understanding of community and support-based approaches to juvenile justice in the greater Los Angeles area. The minor includes classes such as “Institutional Inequality in American Political and Social Policy” and “Adolescent Gang Intervention” that aim to equip a new generation of social workers and policymakers with the skill set needed to address deep-seated failures in California’s approach to juvenile justice.
“The goal is to educate undergraduate students to become knowledgeable about the California Division of Juvenile Justice,” Monica Ellis, a senior executive director at the School of Social Work, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “By doing so we hope our students will be empowered to be voices of underserved communities, creators of nonprofit programs and initiators of thought-provoking policy.”
Ellis and her team at the School of Social Work also plan to partner with nonprofit organizations and community-based youth programs in the greater L.A. area. Students will have the opportunity to work hands-on with these organizations and provide meaningful treatment and the necessary resources to ensure the healthy development of at-risk youth populations.
“We’re seeing how [the juvenile justice system] is incarcerating kids for their trauma,” said Robert Hernandez, a faculty member at the School of Social Work who helped spearhead the project. 
“We have a whole host of expertise at the School of Social Work who have come together to see,” he said. “can we really shift the paradigm and look at how can we have social workers being engaged in the criminal justice system?” 
The minor, which is open to all undergraduate students, is part of a broader effort on behalf of the School of Social Work to expand its undergraduate presence on campus. The hope, according to Hernandez, is to attract a diverse range of students with varying academic interests, career goals and skills. 
One such student, Orlando Ambriz, a freshman majoring in psychology who is a U.S. military veteran, cites his own struggles with mental illness and his experiences growing up as his inspiration for enrolling in the juvenile justice minor.
“I grew up in Santa Ana, and I had a lot of friends who became gang members,” Ambriz said. “The thing is, I want to reach these kids … before they get put into the system because once you get put into the system, that’s it. You’re done. You’re in the system for life.”
After retiring from a 20-year career in the military, Ambriz spent 11 weeks in an inpatient rehab program seeking treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. Ambriz believes his past will allow him to better reach at-risk juveniles who often struggle with mental health issues. 
The creation of the minor comes just months after California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the closure of the state’s Division of Juvenile Justice in late May, transferring control of juvenile justice to the state’s Health and Human Services Department.
Hernandez and other faculty and staff at the School of Social Work view Newsom’s decision as an important first step in adopting a treatment-based approach that concentrates on the healthy development of at-risk youth, no matter their racial or socioeconomic background. Newsom’s decision also presents an opportunity for programs such as the new minor to have a real impact on the future of juvenile justice in L.A., Hernandez said.
“If anything, this is a chance that we’ll be able to influence the field,” Hernandez said. “Everybody is looking at a trauma-informed approach. Everybody is looking at a more health-and-healing approach … This is all a social works lens. This is where I believe our field can heavily influence [juvenile justice].”
Jacquelyn McCroskey, a professor at the School of Social Work who specializes in youth development, echoes the importance of adopting a holistic, treatment-based approach within the juvenile justice system. 
“We need to make sure that people understand youth development,” McCroskey said. “We need to understand the resources for families to help support the development of their children from an early age … So the focus is on youth development rather than criminal justice.”
While McCroskey and Hernandez see the measures taken by Newsom as a step in the right direction, they agree there is still a lot of work to be done in reimagining juvenile justice in Los Angeles and the United States at large. 
“This minor, I would say, is aligned, it’s [the] perfect time,” Hernandez said. “We’re at this juncture now that it’s even more fruitful for us to really promote … taking a social working lens to this issue of juvenile justice.”

President Donald Trump has been promising a coronavirus vaccine for what seems like forever. During the final presidential debate between him and former Vice President Joe Biden, he claimed that pharmaceutical companies are “within weeks” of being able to release a vaccine to the public. Several health experts, on the other hand, are saying that it will more likely be mid-2021 before this can happen. 
Despite the conflicting information, one thing is for sure: many Americans are waiting anxiously for the vaccine, which they hope will bring an end to the pandemic and allow them to return to jobs and schools.
However, vaccination has been a point of debate in the United States for years. Even in schools, which often require vaccines for attendance, students may opt out of receiving them, citing medical, religious or philosophical reasons. USC, for example, requires students to verify immunity from MMR, chickenpox and meningococcal disease but allows exemptions for all three reasons mentioned above. 
As schools begin to reopen, vaccination will become an especially relevant issue, and schools will need to evaluate to what extent they will be able to mandate coronavirus testing and protections. The answer to this will be pivotal in ensuring the health and safety of students at USC.
Like with the reopening of on-campus housing, USC’s decisions are contingent on those of the state of California because vaccination requirements, like most other public health issues, are largely decided by individual states, not the federal government. In 1905, when the United States was in the midst of the smallpox epidemic, the Supreme Court ruled in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that states could enforce vaccinations when they are “necessary for the public health or the public safety.” 
As of now, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration said it would approve a vaccine with at least 50% effectiveness, which roughly equates to the effectiveness of influenza vaccines but is well below that of the smallpox vaccine, which is 95%. 
This further complicates the issue of compulsory vaccinations at the state level. The Harvard Law Review writes that the justification for Jacobson v. Massachusetts was that “there was no other less coercive means available to staunch the outbreak;” in other words, the “vaccination was a medical necessity to combat the disease.” Based on these figures, it’s not definitive whether or not the vaccine is the most coercive means to end the pandemic. Indeed, Director of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Robert Redfield has said that face masks are the best defense against the coronavirus.
“We have clear scientific evidence they work,” he said. “I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.” 
Despite this, almost 20 states still do not require people to wear face masks in public places. As states and individuals continue to resist recommendations by health experts, it is easy to see this continuing after the announcement of a coronavirus vaccine. 
As the fall semester winds down, the USC administration has yet to decide whether students will be able to return to campus in the spring. In the fall, USC announced that it would require all students to undergo coronavirus testing before being permitted to stay in USC housing. In addition, face coverings are required on campus, in accordance with county and state regulations.
When a vaccine is released, USC will not be able to enforce policies concerning it with as much certainty. The CDC has already stated that it is “unethical and illegal to test someone who does not want to be tested” and is likely to take a similar position on vaccinations. 
For the health and safety of students, coronavirus testing and protections should be required in schools. Vaccination was essential in the eradication of smallpox. Equally important was the solidarity and national unity that emerged as people battled a common enemy, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization.
“As the world confronts the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity’s victory over smallpox is a reminder of what is possible when nations come together to fight a common health threat,” he said.
In the face of the pandemic, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States alone, it is not the time to be divided over masks or coronavirus testing and vaccines. If students want to be back in school, they should have to comply with scientifically-backed health recommendations, if not for themselves, then for others.

Los Angeles is just one win away from its second pro sports title in the last two weeks, and the Dodgers are looking to close it out in tonight’s Game 6. 
But … it doesn’t feel like manager Dave Roberts is looking to do the same. 
Tony Gonsolin is expected to have the ball tonight for the Dodgers, and the Tampa Bay Rays will start former Cy Young award winner Blake Snell. Roberts will stick to the regular rotation rather than pitching Dodgers ace Walker Buehler on short rest in Game 6. 
There are two ways to look at this decision, but the last couple of seasons have conditioned me to believe the correct decision is always the opposite of what Roberts chooses. 
I’ll get into why I am so skeptical of the Dodgers’ skipper in a moment. But first, what a series this has been so far. 
At the League Championship Series stage with four teams left, I wanted to see a Dodgers vs. Astros rematch, and I wasn’t that excited to watch the Rays in the World Series after they eliminated Houston in the ALCS. They’re a great team, but it didn’t feel like they were all that fun to watch. Well, I was wrong. 
Game 4 was a roller coaster with one of the wildest finishes I’ve seen in a postseason game that baseball will remember for a long time. 
Manuel Margot’s attempt to steal home in Game 5 was about two inches short of immortalizing him in World Series history. But, Clayton Kershaw still deserves some recognition for not panicking. Unable to see Margot breaking for home plate, it requires great veteran instincts to quickly step off the rubber and deliver an accurate throw home without balking. 
Kershaw has been the biggest question mark for the Dodgers this postseason. Chalk it up to bad luck or say he can’t handle postseason pressure — it doesn’t matter. It’s undeniable that Kershaw isn’t the same guy in his postseason career as his dominant regular season self. His career regular season ERA of 2.43 is incredible. 4.19 in the postseason is not. 
So, I was relieved to see Kershaw get through his Game 5 outing with success (and I’m not even a Dodgers fan. My team, the Texas Rangers, has plenty of time to reminisce about their American League-worst 22 wins while the World Series takes place in their brand new, billion-dollar stadium in Arlington). 
Dodgers fans were loving a classic Kershaw performance when Roberts pulled him out of the game in the sixth inning. I’ve never seen a manager booed by his own fans in the World Series for pulling a pitcher who was doing well. Maybe that proves I’m not alone in my distrust of Roberts. 
You don’t have to look far to find questionable decisions by Roberts. Taking out Blake Treinen in Game 4 in favor of Pedro Báez led to a go-ahead 3-run homer for Tampa Bay. And why was Bellinger not in center field? Chris Taylor isn’t the best defender on the team, and maybe Bellinger doesn’t boot that single in the bottom of the ninth. Taking out Dustin May in Game 5 for Victor González almost brought late-game trouble as well. These calls are all from the last two games.
This brings us back to Game 6. I understand why Roberts doesn’t want to use Buehler on short rest, especially considering the Dodgers have a lead in the series. Buehler should be more effective in Game 7 if needed and you don’t want to waste your one shot at pitching your ace. 
However, pitching Gonsolin, who was good in the regular season but has seen a brutal stretch of appearances lately, against a pitcher like Snell almost feels like giving the Rays a win and rolling the dice on a Game 7. Gonsolin is a rookie and has given up 8 earned runs in 7.2 innings this postseason. He’s allowed more home runs in three games this postseason than he did all regular season. 
Maybe I’m being too harsh on Roberts, but I still can’t understand why such a talented team consistently makes things interesting (in a bad way) in the playoffs. Typically when that happens, someone’s making the wrong decisions. 
I would pitch Buehler in Game 6. Then, if you end up in a Game 7, Julio Urías will be good to go. He gave the Dodgers a quality start in Game 3 in the NLCS and then closed out Game 7 with three perfect innings. Buehler is their best guy, and he’s a competitor. He isn’t going to melt down because he didn’t get his full five days of rest; he wants to be out there and help bring home the trophy. 
Roberts should go all in on Game 6 rather than give the Rays breathing room. Game 7s are risky, and Rays veteran Charlie Morton seems to pitch like Sandy Koufax in them.
Everything the Dodgers have worked for is right in front of them. They have all the talent to go take it — including one of the best starting pitchers in Major League Baseball. If this is the wrong decision and this team comes up short again, I highly doubt Roberts will be the manager of the Dodgers in 2021. I hope we don’t have to find out.
