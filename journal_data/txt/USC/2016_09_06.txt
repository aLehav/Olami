The Department of Public Safety organized the Southern California KEMO Car Show on campus Saturday to commemorate fallen DPS officer Keith Lawrence and his fiancée Monica Quan, who were shot by a disgruntled Los Angeles Police Department officer in a 2013 killing spree.
The officer, Christopher Dorner, had been recently fired and went on a shooting rampage through Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties that ended with his death during a standoff with police at a cabin in the San Bernardino Mountains.
Both Lawrence and Quan played basketball at Concordia University, and the car show was intended to raise money for a basketball scholarship in their names.
DPS Captain Ed Palmer coordinated the event and praised its success, especially since it was the car show’s first year on the West Coast.
“We were able to raise a decent contribution to the basketball scholarship in Keith and Monica’s names,” Palmer said. “Monica’s parents were able to attend the event and that made it even more special.”
Three of the cars in the show were Palmer’s, who enjoys customizing and exhibiting cars.
“Police officers are people just like [you]. We have families and other concerns that we put aside every day to serve the public,” Palmer said. “Also we have lives and things we enjoy just like everyone else.”
Next year, Palmer’s goal is to make the show larger and more successful.
“I don’t think the word got out early enough about this show, and I want to ensure that everyone knows about [it] for next year,” Palmer said.

Four academics discussed how faith shapes cultural and societal views on gender and sexuality at the “Gender and Sexuality: Engaging Sacred Traditions” event that took place at the USC University Club on Tuesday. The event is part of the on-going “Race, Faith, and Violence” series, which is hosted by the Institute of Advanced Catholic Studies, the USC Caruso Catholic Center, the Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics and Our Savior Parish. “Race, Faith and Violence” aims to explore the impact that three major religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have on global events and cultural as well as societal norms.
The panel featured Aysha Hidayatullah, a professor at the University of San Francisco; Sharon Groves, an Auburn Theological Seminary; Rabbi Reuven Firestone, the Regenstein professor at Hebrew Union College; and Pim Valkenberg, a professor at the Catholic University of America.
The event focused on the intersection between those religions and gender and sexuality, including feminism and the LGBTQ community. Speakers touched upon past views of gender and sexuality, and how they have evolved in contemporary society and the issues that are still present because of the way people interpret sacred text.
“Race, violence and faith is always an issue, has always been an issue from the time we have existed and will continue to be an issue,” Executive Director Samuel Paul said, urging the importance of these events for USC students and the community as a whole.
Hidayatullah spoke of how the interpretation of the Qur’an is being changed in favor of the feminist and LGBTQ movements.
She pointed out how the Qur’an is supposed to be an enduring text and that its interpretation, as long as it aligns with the core principles of Islam, should be valid.
It is this exceptionality that people of Muslim faith use in order to promote feminist and LGBTQ rights, according to Hidayatullah.
“Religion is animated by human context,” said Hidayatullah in reference to how concepts like patriarchy come about not only from the notion of religion, but that the culture of the time shapes the religion. Therefore, the context in which sacred text is interpreted is ever changing, she said.
“There’s a lot of talk, and for good reason, about the difficulty of accepting differences,” said Father James Heft, Alton Brooks Professor of Religion at USC Programs such as “Race, Faith, and Violence” help people recognize and respect others that are not like them, according to Heft.
Groves touched upon the attack in Orlando, Florida. For Groves, this event relates to religious pluralism, race and cultural difference.
Muslims who identify as LGBTQ are walking a fine line between both worlds and find it hard to choose either, according to Groves.
“Orlando woke people up to the work that still needed to be done. The country began to understand that anti-LGBTQ attitudes did not end with marriage protections for couples,” Groves said.
Firestone commented on the bipolar nature of Judaism and the Jewish people. He also discussed how more and more LGBTQ rabbis and women are being ordained even as some Orthodox Jewish communities find it against scripture.
“Today we find a range in Jewish practices, from the ultra-Orthodox that one would think has no connection at all to sympathies toward equality in terms of gender and sexuality, and then you have everything in the Jewish community that runs very much to the left,” Firestone said.
Valkenberg informed the audience on his experience with his female colleagues and their difficulties with certain aspects of the Catholic Church, such as ascending into leadership positions. He also expressed how important it is to study religion in order to understand the theological and institutional matters that concern and affect society.
“Please study [religion] because the future is in your hands,” Valkenberg said.

Undergraduate Student Government Associate Director of Elections Katherine Lee and Assistant Director of Elections Donielle Bunyard presented proposed changes to the election bylaws at the USG Senate meeting Tuesday evening.
One of the changes would lengthen the time allowed for the election commission to deliberate on issues during the period from the confirmation of the candidates to the start of second semester.
Currently, the director of elections has 24 hours to decide whether an issue merits a meeting by the commission, and the commission has 48 hours to pass down a verdict.
The proposed bylaw change would lengthen the deliberation time to 48 hours and 72 hours, respectively, although the original times would apply from the start of second semester through election season.
The proposed bylaw changes would also overhaul the system for sanctioning candidates.
The previous system of strikes necessitated specific sanctions regardless of the violation, while the new system would give the election commission more discretion in administering the appropriate sanction for the situation.
The proposal would also abolish the distinction between major and minor strikes, which Lee described as “very confusing.”
With the changes, the elections directors are seeking to administer sanctions on campaigns that will curtail offending behavior.
“We really just want to find a good fit for the violation — not necessarily giving them a sanction that would hurt their campaign more, but one that would match with what they did,” Lee said. “For example, if they’ve committed a social media violation, and we give them ‘no physical campaigning for one day,’ they could continue to commit their violation.”
Several USG Senators, including USG Senator Daniel Newman and USG Senator Josh Lurie, raised concerns that the changes would grant the election commission too much discretion in imposing sanctions.
In response, Lee said that the judicial branch would have the power to override any decisions by the election commission they found unfair, although Sen. Tingyee Chang claimed that the judicial process would be too lengthy for a time-sensitive election.
Bunyard said that the judicial branch has always been the resource for candidates who want to appeal election commission decisions, although she and Lee are working to find an alternate pathway.
“This has been in place for as long as USG has been around, so this has always been the channel,” Bunyard said. “But we’re going to be talking to them. I’ve already spoken to Sen. Chang and Sen. Lee and we’re going to be in communication about what are the best policies, and we’re also reaching out to judicial to speak with them about it.”
Other proposed changes include a clarification that senators cannot run on a slate with presidential candidates, which has not been an issue at USC but has arisen at other universities.
In addition, candidates now have a mechanism to disavow those campaigning on their behalf by providing evidence to the election commission that the outside campaigners are not involved with their campaign.
The changes will be voted on at the next USG meeting.
The Senate also voted to fill a vacant position in USG’s advocacy branch, which had been discussed in last week’s meeting.
The Senate unanimously voted to confirm Maariyah Patel, originally the assistant director of philanthropy fund, as the new Academic Affairs director, after voting against immediate confirmation during the previous Senate meeting.

Faculty at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences have filed charges against USC with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the University of unfair labor practices and asking for a delay in the upcoming unionization vote.
Joseph Chen | Daily TrojanForward march · USC Faculty Forward, a precursor to the Faculty Union, holds a rally on campus in April 2015 to encourage support for higher wages and better benefits for the University’s non-tenure track faculty.
In an email sent on Friday afternoon, the USC Faculty Union — a group of non-tenure track faculty working to join the Service Employees International Union Local 721 — stated that USC’s “business model of education” had left them with low wages and few benefits, a problem that could be remedied by joining a labor union.
Efforts to unionize, however, have been met with resistance from the University, resulting in the charges that were filed Friday by SEIU Local 721 on behalf of USC faculty, according to the email.
Adjunct faculty at the Roski School of Art and Design and the USC International Academy voted to join SEIU Local 721 in February, but the Dornsife vote resulted in a loss for pro-union organizers. However, following an appeal by the USC Faculty Union, the National Labor Relations Board ruled in April that the University’s actions prior to the vote — including a series of emails sent out by Provost Michael Quick, which discouraged faculty members from supporting unionization — made the results of the vote invalid.
“Even after a landslide unionization victory in Roski, USC has maintained an aggressive anti-union stance — refusing to recognize the Roski union victory and promising to appeal their union vote to the highest court, flooding the National Labor Relations Board with frivolous appeals aimed at silencing our collective voice,” the Faculty Union wrote in the email. “In Dornsife, the University’s blatant lawbreaking during the unionization process led the Federal government to throw out the election results altogether and call for a new vote.”
Andrea Parra, an associate professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and one of the organizers of the Faculty Union, hopes that bringing charges against USC will result in a statement of neutrality from the University, which so far has actively tried to prevent unionization on campus.
“[The University’s] campaign of fear and intimidation towards faculty will only intensify if left unchecked — together we are holding the University accountable, and ensuring that faculty can consider the question of unionization through a fair and democratic process free from University interference,” Parra wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Despite our repeated attempts to hold the University accountable for its continued law breaking, University administrators sent out another communication encouraging faculty to vote against the union just last week.”
Parra said that USC’s anti-union stance has also contributed to the Faculty Union’s actions against the University.
“For instance, USC administration continues to charge that contingent faculty are ‘managers’ due to the service component of their contracts, and are therefore precluded from organizing a union,” Parra said.
The Faculty Union has asked that the Dornsife vote be delayed “to protect free and fair elections for workers,” according to the email. The vote was initially supposed to take place within several weeks of the original NLRB ruling in April, but the NLRB will set the new date of the vote if the charges are upheld, according to Parra.
The University, however, has stated that the request to delay the vote will not significantly change the outcome and believes that the initial results should be respected.
“Local 721 has not told us what charges they filed with the NLRB,” Quick said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We are acting in good faith and lawfully. We believe Dornsife faculty should have the chance to make their will known. It seems to us that Local 721 would not be trying to block the election if they thought the faculty majority supports them.”
The NLRB ruling in April stated that pay raises offered in the week prior to the unionization vote, as well as statements implying that faculty would no longer be able to participate in governance, “[created] a general atmosphere of fear making a free election impossible.” The University has disputed this report on the basis that Quick’s statements about faculty governance were meant to explain to faculty what would occur were they to vote for unionization.

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has implemented new security policies that will be in effect for all USC football home games, including this Saturday’s home opener against Utah State.
The changes come as the Coliseum is now also home to the Los Angeles Rams, meaning the stadium must comply with NFL security protocol. In May, the NFL Committee on Stadium Safety implemented new regulation on the size and type of bag that may be brought into the stadium in order to ease and expedite  the security process of fans who are entering the stadium.
The most drastic change in Coliseum policy is the new rule that allows only clear bags into the stadium. The dimensions of the bag must not exceed 12”x6”x12.” Alternatively, the new measure allows fans to bring a one-gallon, clear reusable storage bag with them.
The Coliseum will continue to allow small clutches into the stadium as long as they are about the size of a hand — they may not be larger than 4.5”x6.5.” They may or may not have a strap.
The security measure does not limit or change the items that fans are allowed to enter the stadium with, just the manner in which they do so. Bags that are no longer permitted include fanny packs, backpacks and camera bags.
The Coliseum cited terrorist attacks, specifically the events in Paris and San Bernardino, as factors that led to the adoption of this policy. This policy is uniform with all NFL stadiums, and some universities have adopted similar policies. The University of Michigan and Michigan State University both do not allow any bags in their respective stadiums.
In order to enforce the new policy, an additional security checkpoint has been set up where security personnel will check for prohibited bags and items before fans reach the Coliseum entry gates. Due to the new perimeter fence and the Exposition Park construction, tailgating space near gates 4, 16 and 19 is no longer accessible.

The USC football team must have thought Labor Day was Saturday. With the exception of a very solid first quarter, in which they somehow emerged with a 3-point lead, the Trojans essentially took the rest of the day off. When it was all said and done against the defending national champions in the most highly anticipated season opener in recent memory, USC left Dallas with nothing but a huge slice of humble pie — not even a touchdown scored or a minor moral victory included.
At this point in the week, even after digesting the numbers “52-6” for a couple days, there still isn’t anything worth discussing about the Alabama game. It was awful. The Trojans looked terrible. I certainly didn’t go into the game with that much confidence, but this result was worse than anyone could have guessed. Clay Helton could not have failed his first test as the new permanent head coach more epically. In Clancy Pendergast’s first game back as the defensive coordinator, the Trojan defense put up its worst showing since Pendergast’s 2013 unit surrendered 62 points to Arizona State.
That 62-41 debacle at ASU in 2013 is one that the Alabama offensive coordinator remembers all too well. It was 3:14 a.m. — that coming morning when then-head coach Lane Kiffin was relieved of his duties at LAX. Kiffin made sure to note that in a postgame tweet, hashtagging “#3:14AM-LAX” in a picture with the game ball. Luckily for Helton, though, witnessing such a comparable defensive collapse didn’t immediately cost him his job.
Of course, it’s way, way, way too early to draw any conclusions about Helton after this beat down. His sample size is still microscopic. And from looking elsewhere around college football, it’s clear that everything is not lost just yet — not for the mid-term future of Helton’s head coaching tenure at USC and not even for this season.
USC was close, but it probably didn’t even have the worst week out of any team in the AP Top 25. Oklahoma’s loss to Houston was huge, and LSU losing to Wisconsin throws another giant wrench into what we expected from potential playoff contenders.
The Trojan’s performance was maybe the most abysmal, but the trajectory of the Trojan season didn’t really change that much with them coming out of the first week 0-1.
USC’s loss arguably isn’t even the most interesting result out of the conference. With UCLA’s 31-24 loss at Texas A&M, that left the top-ranked team in the Pac-12 South according to the AP Poll — UCLA came in as No. 16 to USC’s No. 20, though both are now unranked — with a significant blemish on its record. The South division of the Pac-12 is now wide open, with none of the six teams cracking the Top 25. Luckily for both L.A. rivals, the non-conference losses don’t actually count for anything in the standings.
What they do significantly affect is the chances that a team out of the Pac-12 South makes the playoffs, and the results are indicative of the fact that it wasn’t that likely of a scenario to begin with.
With all that being said, week 1 shows that anything can happen in college football, especially given the possibilities from conference championship games and a four-team playoff. With the strength of USC’s schedule, the Trojans probably have another loss to spare before seriously discounting the possibility of a playoff appearance. Even with the Trojan’s toughest conference test coming in its first Pac-12 game — two weeks at No. 7 Stanford — they could still build enough momentum throughout the entire Pac-12 slate and find themselves at the conference championship game. Win in a rematch against Stanford and then earn a first-round playoff rematch with…?
Again, after a game like that, even including the word “playoff” when projecting the rest of USC’s season seems a bit off. A team like Alabama will almost certainly be back to defend their national championship in January. The Trojan team we saw Saturday is on a level nowhere near that of Alabama. I seriously doubt that the performance we saw Saturday is anywhere near what we can and should expect from this USC team.
Maybe we are that bad and liable on defense. Maybe we just gave up and checked out once the Tide starting rolling, indicating that we don’t have the mettle to make it through the hardest schedule in the nation. But I’d like to think that there will be significant improvement from all spots throughout the season. Quarterback Max Browne will hopefully find a rhythm, the defensive line will hopefully gel and Helton will hopefully be able to use this loss to create a feeling of humility and motivation rather than discouragement.
While Helton lacks in his pedigree or his big game gusto, he makes up for it in his workman’s mentality. I’m tempted to start speculating at how Helton, Pendergast and the defensive staff will plan for stopping Stanford’s Heisman-favorite running back Christian McCaffrey two weeks from now. The Trojans first need to take care of Utah State, an opponent whom overlooking could prove to be really, really bad news for Helton and the team going forward. USC shouldn’t have a problem, though, and only need to come away with a W. No style points or margin of victory necessary.
The game against Utah State has an 11 a.m. start time to placate the Pac-12 network’s daily programming schedule — and any frat star tailgaters looking for an excuse to take a sunrise shotgun.
The Trojans shouldn’t need an early wakeup call before the game. They already got one last week.

Junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was involved in a physical altercation with a few defensive players. This was after Smith-Schuster left the field in frustration and was brought back by head coach Clay Helton and offensive coordinator Tee Martin.
“We’ve got a mad football team right now,” Helton said. “I wish we could play today to be honest with you.”
Helton described Tuesday’s practice as ultra competitive and was not worried about the actions that Smith-Schuster took on the field.
“JuJu reminds me of Marquise Lee, two of the most competitive men I’ve ever seen in my life,” Helton said. “When you have that much passion and competitiveness sometimes it spills over.
Scuffles happen in football practice, but we’re all brothers out here.”
Additionally, sophomore inside linebacker Osa Masina and redshirt sophomore defensive end Don Hill practiced on Tuesday, as permitted by the University, although neither will play against Utah State.
In the trenches
The offensive line was highly criticized after Saturday’s performance, in which the Trojans rushed for only 64 yards.
Helton blamed missed assignment cues and a lack of physicality as the main reasons for the offensive lines’ struggles. Redshirt senior right tackle Zach Banner also noted the competitive nature of the practice and the fact that everyone was willing to get to work following the tough loss.
“Everyone was here getting the extra lift in on Sunday, rather than waiting until Monday,” Banner said. “We had almost 70 players lifting Sunday afternoon and then after that, watching film. Loving up on each other, and getting ready to come out this week.”
Injury Report
Helton clarified the status of players who were injured in Saturday’s game as well as during practice.
Sophomore defensive tackle Noah Jefferson did not practice due to a shoulder sprain and Helton was unsure whether or not he would be available against Utah State.
Senior inside linebacker Quinton Powell was sick and did not practice Tuesday.
Redshirt senior tight end Taylor McNamara suffered an injured ankle during practice that Helton described as “not too bad.”
Junior center Toa Lobendahn was also held out of practice due to some swelling on his non-surgically repaired knee, but Helton did not express too much concern.
Helton expects redshirt junior defensive tackle Khalil Rodgers to return to action late this week after suffering a hamstring injury.

On the cover of The Hollywood Reporter this week, beautiful blond tresses cascade around Renee Zellweger, actress and movie star, whose latest movie Bridget Jones’s Baby premieres this month. “Renee Returns” is the title of the cover, and quotes such as “Why are we still talking about how women look?” and “Renee Zellweger on Aging in Hollywood, Gender Inequality” fill the inner pages. All this is seemingly in response to the October 2014 Elle Women in Hollywood red carpet, where Renee stepped out and was called “unrecognizable” by critics and paparazzi because of apparent cosmetic surgery that she had undergone.
Photo courtesy of MiramaxDear Diary · Bridget Jones’s Diary is a 2001 romantic comedy film directed by Sharon Maguire and is a reinterpretation of Pride and Prejudice. Protagonist Bridget Jones is an example of the “unruly woman.”
Renee has had to answer for her supposed physical change in a litany of different ways. At first she agreed that she was “different” and in fact, the change was attributed to being finally “happy.” Later, she penned a Huffington Post article addressing the rampant sexism conveyed in one critic’s review of the new Bridget Jones trailer, an article titled: ”Renee Zellweger: If She No Longer Looks Like Herself, Has She Become a Different Actress?” In her own piece, Zellweger does not admit to having undergone surgery, but instead raises questions on why women in Hollywood are not allowed to move beyond scrutinization of their youth and beauty.
This weekend, in either a subconscious ode to the new movie or just through pure coincidence, I decided to re-watch Bridget Jones with my boyfriend (yes, men can and should watch it, too). And I was struck by how prophetic and powerful Bridget was, and it got me thinking about some terms brought up in school.
The other day, in my Intro to Television class, we discussed the propagation of the television trope of the “unruly woman” — who is defined by her relationship to excess in life. She might swear a lot, eat a lot, drink a lot, sleep around a lot. She is the character exemplified by Lena Dunham’s Hannah Horvath in Girls, Mindy Kaling in The Mindy Project or Ilana and Abbi in Broad City.
Even though it seems that Girls, Broad City and The Mindy Project have been adored and lauded for their seemingly “revolutionary” feminist depictions of female life and love on the small screen, Bridget was one of the first examples of this “unruly woman.” She “drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses like her mother,” as her future romantic interest Mark Darcy proclaims — at first disgustedly and then, later, adoringly.
And yet, I do not feel that Bridget Jones was given the credit she deserved when she first arrived in cineplexes back in 2004. Why wasn’t Bridget given more notice and confidence in literature and media for her own exemplification of this unruly woman? Part of me feels it has something to do with genre. The romantic comedy, with examples ranging from The Philadelphia Story  to You’ve Got Mail to Friends with Benefits, has long been pigeonholed into the category of a “chick flick” — a term often used with abandonment and meant to degrade and dismiss the female stories at hand.
However, as some critics would argue, the genre itself has all but died out and settled into the cinematic graveyard, along with the classic Western and film noir. But I think that might have to do with the infiltration the genre has had with making its way to the small screen. Even though we wouldn’t necessarily call The Mindy Project or Girls romantic comedies in the purest sense of the term, they definitely fit into the genre. Now, however, they are engendering a new type of discussion around the female narrative, one that is no longer relegating the female story to the back seat, away from the male audience’s eyes. And yet, Zellweger’s criticism seems to still be facing the backward views we might have had in 2004. We still haven’t allowed Bridget Jones and the actress who portrays her to transcend typical Hollywood conventions. The media has not allowed Zellweger — or perhaps any other female actress whose name doesn’t start with “M” and end in “Streep” — to ignore the age factor. Even though THR cover story is in no way damning, part of me wishes they’d never brought up the controversy at all.
If we live in a media landscape that now respects and even reveres the character trope exemplified by Bridget Jones, don’t we think it’s now time to move past the age factor, into a new era? Bridget was a stepping stone to normalizing this unruly woman, but we still have a long way to go to normalizing other aspects of being a woman. Maybe it’ll take a while, and we’ll look back at Bridget Jones — and by osmosis, Zellweger herself — as a revolutionary feminist icon only in retrospect. It wouldn’t be the first time.

Alexis Bradby is a media arts and practice major with big ambitions of becoming a stand-up comedian.  During high school, she participated in Forensics Acting Speech Competitions. Her favorite events were Storytelling and Impromptu Speaking, and she received several awards for both categories. To Bradby, stand-up comedy is a combination of both of these events. While she is a self-proclaimed amateur who is just taking a chance on her dreams, Bradby is already on her way there. She will be performing on Wednesday at Flappers Burbank at 9:30 p.m. The lineup includes other performers such as Tess Rafferty, Topher and Laurie Kilmartin.
Photo courtesy of Alexis BradbyLaugh track · Aspiring comedian Alexis Bradby has been a performer since high school. She will performing stand-up about her personal life experiences and her view on the world on Wednesday.
Daily Trojan: Why and when did you decide to pursue comedy?
Alexis Bradby: I performed my first comedy set at Tennessee’s Governor’s School for the Arts the summer before my junior year of high school, and even though I was terrified, I fell in love with the feeling of having a room full of people laughing. I decided to perform that day because it was the end of the camp, and I figured that if I didn’t try it with a bunch of people I would never see again then it would probably never happen. The real moment I decided to try and pursue comedy was when I took Intro to Stand-Up Comedy last spring with Craig Anton, the actor who plays the dad on Phil of the Future. During the first week of that class, I realized that this is something that I want to do.
DT: Did you consider other occupations before this?
AB: Everyone who knows me well knows that I have no idea what I am going to do when I graduate, and I’m starting to accept that feeling because there’s nothing wrong with uncertainty. I don’t like the idea of only doing one occupation since I have way too many interests. I like doing comedy, but I also like making videos and playing rugby.
DT: What is the topic of most of your performances?
AB: Don’t think I’m narcissistic for this, but most of my performances are about me and what I think about the world. Right now, I feel like a lot of the jokes I’m writing are about this weird transition to adulthood. It’s freaking me out, and I know that a lot of college students can relate to this feeling. At least I hope it’s not just me freaking out.
DT: What do you get out of performing and making people laugh?
AB: It makes me happy. I’m a very empathetic person, and if I ever read articles or watch the news, I cry about all the terrible things going on in the world. I just want to grab a megaphone and scream the Black Eyed Peas’ song “Where is the Love?” at people. But I don’t think that’s socially acceptable, so I just try to make people laugh so maybe they can forget about all the sadness in the world, if only for a moment.
DT: Tell us more about your show this Wednesday.
AB: Well, it’s this Wednesday. And with some really funny people. Laura House is the host. She’s hilarious. Laurie Kilman runs a very popular podcast with Jackie Kashan who opens for Maria Bamford. This is my first show that I’m booking outside of the Intro to Stand-Up class offered in the School of Dramatic Arts. I hope to make people laugh by telling relatable jokes about parents and what it means to grow up and become an adult.

Chances are most people would be unable to recognize Travis Scott’s name, but one would be hard-pressed to find any music fan who has not heard at least one of his productions. The 24-year-old hip-hop artist has helped produce albums for some of hip-hop’s biggest titans, including Jay Z’s Magna Carta Holy Grail and Kanye West’s Yeezus. Scott’s second album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, follows his critically acclaimed debut Rodeo and is a continuation of the young artist’s attempt to bring himself into the forefront as a performer. Unfortunately, the results are decidedly mixed.
Photo courtesy of Grand Hustle RecordsBirds of a feather · Rapper Travis Scott released his newest album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, follows his critically acclaimed Rodeo. The album was made available exclusively on Apple Music Friday.
As listeners of Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and Rihanna’s “B*tch Better Have My Money” can attest, Scott primarily produces dark, minimalistic beats. Birds continues this tradition and revels in eerie instrumentals and heavy, auto-tuned vocals. In several of his tracks, Scott’s style shines through, such as in the catchy, well-produced beat of the moody “lose.” However, many of the beats feel surprisingly rushed. Prime examples of this include the plodding and downright unpleasant train-whistle beat of “sweet sweet” and the strangely skittish and discordant instrumentals of “guidance.” Furthermore, unlike in the more instrumentally experimental and varied Rodeo, Scott does not make much of an attempt to introduce variation into his songs, resulting in most of the album having a static sound.
Bird’s vocals are also very mixed. Scott’s voice is not particularly distinctive, and his lack of range and inflection in his delivery makes many of his songs sound monotonous. Perhaps the absence of emotion in his performance is an attempt to reflect the dark background instrumentals, but the performance ends up sounding robotic and indifferent, as exemplified in the auto-tuned slurring of “way back.” Moreover, when Scott attempts to insert some more experimental vocals, such as his imitation of a phone in “pick up the phone,” the effect is grating rather than intriguing. In an attempt to cover up for the lack of energy and intrigue in his voice, many of the tracks utilize pre-recorded chants of exuberant men in the background yelling things such as “Straight up!” “Yeah!” and “It’s lit!” In “first take,” the background singers even chant random words from Scott’s rhymes in a vain attempt to energize the track. The effect is jarring and only increases the listener’s awareness of Scott’s vocal deficiencies.
Due to his desire to increase visibility and perhaps, an awareness of his own lack of vocal intrigue, Scott employs no fewer than 16 guest verses to prop up his 14-track album. Many heavyweights are present, including Kid Cudi, Kendrick Lamar, the Weeknd and André 3000. None of these artists deliver career-high performances, but they do add some much-needed variation to Birds and have some genuinely great moments. “through the late night” is a good match for Kid Cudi, whose dark style complements Scott’s well; André 3000 energizes “the ends” with his lively delivery, and Lamar’s well-constructed verse on “goosebumps” is easily one of the greatest moments in the album.
Unfortunately, the high number of well-seasoned and distinctive guest performers on Birds also highlights Scott’s serious lack of personality. The lack of introspection and obsession with sex, violence, women and drugs on virtually every track makes it emblematic of the “bling and bitches” style of rapping, and Scott’s adherence to these topics turns him into a caricature. “coordinate,” “outside” and “beibs in the trap” are just three of these songs, and they say virtually nothing that hasn’t been said in more interesting ways by hundreds of rappers before. Lines like “shout my jeweler, made my chain look like Froot Loops” in “sweet sweet”  and “work it like a stripper, yeah, but you not a stripper, yeah” in “wonderful” seem almost satirical in their triteness, and the album suffers accordingly; “guidance” is entirely about grinding on a girl in the club, and “sdp interlude” repeats the line “smoke some, drink some, pop one” 32 times. With the exception of the more introspective “the ends,” none of the tracks make Travis Scott stand out from the crowd or make the listener want to learn more about him as a stand-alone artist.
In the end, Birds does not make much of a case for Travis Scott to have a solo career. The lyrics are banal, the vocals are boring and even the production seems rushed, though there are a few standout moments. Scott is a talented young producer, but as of now it does not seem that his talents as a vocalist and lyricist are developed enough to properly showcase his skills. Hopefully he will reclaim the momentum from his debut album Rodeo, or else it may be best for his production talents to be showcased behind the bigger personality of a Jay Z or a Kanye West.
This couldn’t more true! As a fan of Scott listening since Kanye West’s “Cruel Summer”, I can definitively say his music isn’t forward-looking. As he takes us into his dark world of drugs and vanity, he seems to see no way out.  At one point he was believed to be Kanye’s successor, but not at this rate.

The apartment smells. A fridge stands alone in the middle of the kitchen. Slimy brown larvae grow all over the inside of the freezer. The shower door leans against the bedroom wall, 10 feet from the tub. The dishwasher leaks, and dirty old pans fill the beaten-down oven. I find uncovered outlets, broken locks, a Scotch-taped thermostat, holes in the walls and a general layer of dirt all over the apartment. I wish I could tell you this was a description of a foreclosed property on an HGTV show and not the apartment I moved into on Aug. 15. Unfortunately, wishes don’t always come true.
I came into my StuHo-managed apartment to find every inch dirty. It was a construction zone, with broken, uneven counters, and every single appliance in terrible condition. Furious, I drove to StuHo’s offices, where I was immediately told that I was overreacting. I requested a refund on our security deposit ($3600) and a prorated rent because the apartment was nowhere near working condition when we moved in. I was told my requests were obscene.
Things only got worse. Our toilet was leaky, our shower flooded, and StuHo hired an incompetent contractor to re-glaze the tub — a process that left such an awful smell in the apartment that my roommate and I moved into a hotel for the night. My roommate had an allergic reaction, most likely to methylene chloride, which is the most common chemical in this procedure — a substance as pleasant as it sounds. Surely, I thought, a horrible misunderstanding; USC vouches for StuHo and would never guide members of the Trojan Family down a bad path. Again, not true. Over the next few days, StuHo proved its only real skill to be negligent mismanagement. The apartment next door confirmed an infestation of cockroaches, and our other neighbor’s apartment flooded and had no access to hot water.
My roommate, who lived in the Shrine Collection before it was purchased by StuHo, had numerous days without power or water, all while living as one of two tenants in an operational and dangerous construction zone. He also had to deal with rats scurrying through the walls, but that’s small enough to forget about, right?
How can StuHo do this? I’d say it’s what they do for a living. They charge USC students insane amounts of money to live near campus, and they cut every corner along the way to increase their profit. StuHo’s management makes used-car salesmen look like the patron saints of commerce.
But companies are bad. That happens. We will figure out the proper way to handle their violation of the lease. What hurts me the most is that we were guided by USC. StuHo may claim not to be associated with the University of Southern California, but they still have flyers all over campus and joint merchandise (featuring trademarked USC logos) all over their leasing office.
We are all young people fighting our way through college. Not all of us have infinite resources, and housing can add insane amounts of money to our bills. I plead for USC to help stop this from happening to their students. I request that USC publically disavow StuHo and sever all ties with them. USC housing is limited, and off-campus housing is an eventuality. At the very least, USC could start an advocacy group so that we don’t have to blindly negotiate with blatantly negligent management companies who carry out negligent and possibly criminal policies.
USC can be forgiven. Past transgressions don’t have to breed future ones. These companies cannot exist without you. Help USC students have a voice — there are a lot of us, and most don’t have the time or energy to constantly argue for their basic tenant’s rights.
Honestly, I’m having a great experience with StuHo. Our property is well maintained and our apt was quite clean. They respond to our requests within a day and there’s no sign of anything terrible. I think if anything, they are biased based on how much a property is worth to them and they take better care of the nicer, newly renovated properties (which is unfair, of course).
And yes, USC students have a voice, but most of them don’t live in Stuho managed housing AND I’m sure not everyone living in a stuho managed apartment is having the same experience (like me and every in my building and the building next door). It would be nonsensical for people who are not affiliated with stuho housing to “have a voice” on this issue. You should just constantly nag management about these issues, not other students. 
With the way tuition price is going, USC resembles StuHo almost more than I’d like to admit. But as one of the residents of StuHo’s Element that’s currently trapped in the Chinatown area, I say down with StuHo. I especially dislike that they put entry level employees in a position to intercept angry messages (some are good friends of mine), while the criminals at the top are immune.

Earlier last week, news outlets around the world broke the news that Brock Turner, the 20-year-old former Stanford swimmer charged with sexually assaulting an unconscious girl, was being released from county jail three months early. After serving only half of his six-month sentence, Turner was allowed to leave on the grounds of “good behavior.”
Some have argued that the outrage over Turner’s release is unbased, as early releases are a fairly common part of the criminal justice system.
While the moral implications behind a reduced sentence are complicated, the overcrowding of prisons (coupled with the cost of housing inmates) often results in the release of prisoners prior to their original sentencing date. The issue of early release is a procedural issue not unique to Turner’s.
All of this considered, prison overcrowding and costs do not change the nature of Turner’s horrific behavior. Given both the existing incarceration system and the nature of his crime, Turner should have served his term in its entirety.
In no way was Turner’s six-month sentencing appropriate to his conviction. Those guilty of charges similar to Turner’s face a maximum sentence of ten years. The judge in Turner’s case, Aaron Persky, made an extremely controversial decision by dropping Turner’s sentence to six months. In the U.S. legal system, judges are given wide latitude. In this case, there appears to be no rationale for the light sentence other than some degree of perceived bias on the part of the judge — who is also a Stanford alum and former student-athlete.
When defending his decision, Persky cited the potential psychological impact that an extended prison stay would have on Turner. What Persky should have given more consideration, however, was the psychological impact that one undergoes when he or she is subjected to sexual assault while unconscious.
The privilege given to Turner is nothing short of unacceptable and unjustifiable. Other rapists, such as those without collegiate athletic status, are almost never given the same treatment. As pathetic as it may be, it appears that Turner’s status as a Caucasian male athlete at a rigorous private university caused him to be treated in a way that is atypical of rapists of different standings.
There are endless statistics that support the notion that those of privilege, especially white men, are given lighter sentences. Such bias issues are inexcusable and can in no way be rationally explained. But the situation regarding Turner sheds light on the larger issue of rape culture on college campuses. In recent years, there have been numerous global stories involving college students being sexually assaulted by their peers.
With most of these cases, sentences are brought down significantly and, in some cases, those guilty are let out of jail after serving only half of their already absurdly low sentence.
It is inexcusable that sexual assaults occurring on college campuses in the U.S. are seen as generally less legitimate than those occurring in other arenas. It is time for universities around the country — students, faculty and everyone else — to take a step back and do everything in their power to create an environment where students feel safest, where consent is understood to be a necessity, not merely a suggestion, and where alcohol is never an excuse.

I have a hard time feeling confident in how I look. Everyone in LA is so beautiful. Any advice on how to love myself? 
Everyday I look in the mirror, I can choose to do one of two things. I can either look myself in the eyes and smile at my reflection or I can pick apart all of the things I wish I could change about myself. More often than not, I would do the latter. I would take note of every pimple, every dry patch, every extra pound that I never wanted, every stretch mark… and then Google how to get rid of it all. Feeling like you want to change some part of yourself is valid. Learning how to love yourself, especially your body, is hard. But know that you’re beautiful. Know that you’re worth it. And know that no one is “perfect.” And… We’re all in this together (cue high school musical)! 
First and foremost, please know that all bodies are beautiful! We all come in different body sizes, different bone structures, different frames, different everything. But that’s what makes us unique. I don’t believe in an “ugly” body and neither should you. You may have a fantasized ideal body type, but the person next to you probably has a different ideal as well. 
Secondly, the most important thing in this life is your health. Constantly swimming in your own negative thoughts is toxic. As cliche as it may sound, you are your worst critic. Perhaps the best advice I ever received was to flip the script. When friends come to you with their own body-image concerns and you’re confused as to how they could not love their bodies– the same goes for you. Practice what you preach and know that just as you want your friends to love their bodies, they want you to love yours. I want you to love yours. Flaunt who you are and your style because you are more than worth it. 
Lastly, I know Los Angeles is a daunting place but perhaps the most wonderful thing about LA is its sheer size. Los Angeles County’s population is actually larger than some states’ (like Ohio). And the people who make up LA are so beautifully different. LA wouldn’t be LA if everyone looked the same… Keep those who know how to embrace these differences close and again, know that you’re beautiful. 
Plus, when we all grow old with our wonderful wrinkles and nice sagging skin– we won’t care about body types. We’ll care about the people we chose to surround ourselves with. So, let me end with this: YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL, I PROMISE!!!!!
