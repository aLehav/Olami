The early fliers for Springfest 2010 promised a genre-spanning lineup of musicians, but the event belonged to headliner T-Pain, no contest.
Program Board’s annual festival, which has in recent years featured appearances from big names such as Lupe Fiasco, Pinback, The Game and even his holiness, Snoop Dogg, brought out a raucous audience of hundreds by the time the Auto-Tune wizard took the stage. But McCarthy Quad didn’t look that way earlier in the day.

USC’s own Natalie Angiuli kicked the event off around 1 p.m., strumming through a helping of pleasant, if somewhat self-conscious, acoustic numbers with a small but interested crowd seated before the stage. Unfortunately for the other daylight acts, the audience would disintegrate into a scattered gathering around the merchant booths and food vendors. Several times throughout the afternoon, various musicians awkwardly invited the unsure spectators to move closer to the stage.
In all fairness to the absent throngs that have normally populated the festival in past years, the daytime lineup was notably lacking in musical diversity. Comprised almost entirely of upcoming indie-rock and hip-hop acts, the bill was bland and one wondered what would’ve happened if Program Board booked a well-known electronic or experimental artist. Given the mainstream ascendence of artists like Yeasayer and MSTRKRFT in recent years, it might be worth a try.
Thankfully, just when it seemed that 2010’s Springfest would be embarrassingly under-attended, a solid crowd began to form near sundown as NorCal rapper Bobby Brackins took the stage for a quick but formidable 10-minute set. Three-piece band The Cataracs followed, suggesting what a jam session between Akon and Drownsoda might sound like. Finally, Virginia Beach duo Clipse led the crowd with powerful renditions of “Freedom,” “There Was a Murder” and several tracks off its new LP, Til the Casket Drops.
By the time T-Pain emerged onstage with a two-man entourage at 9:30 p.m. — with almost unheard of punctuality from a headliner whose set was scheduled to begin at 9:25 p.m. — hundreds had gathered in front of the stage, some clearly drunk, but all roaring with gratification.
What followed was a shamelessly enjoyable mix of music and comedy. A pattern began to emerge, with T-Pain running through the first minute or two of all his most recent hits, each track broken by a muffled explosion, courtesy of D.J. Louis. Were it not for T-Pain’s tangible energy and hysterically over-the-top dance moves (lots of airplanes and crotch grabs made the cut), the routine would have felt predictable and disappointing. Instead, the singer brought the house down for nearly an hour.
If there was in fact a vocoder in T-Pain’s rig, it was kept well concealed. While the live vocals occasionally rang with the digitally manipulated notes T-Pain has unleashed upon mainstream hip-hop since 2005, the Auto-Tune did not make or break the show, as one might have expected.
Between songs, T-Pain and his sidekicks loosened up with playful barbs about what they thought was USC’s status as a dry campus (“You’re gonna be my Noveau,” T-Pain said to the audience at one point), asides about losing weight and the occasional boast about their many accomplishments. Toward the end of the set, T-Pain took a moment to note that his current quota of No. 1 hits ranks one spot lower than that of the Beatles.
The performer then suggested — somewhat crudely — that audience members encourage their mothers to consider that while engaging in certain sexual acts.
For the most part, the crowd responded with loud enthusiasm swaying to and singing along with “Got Money,” “Yeah,” “Low,” “Can’t Believe It” and, of course, “Buy You A Drank.”
As the show passed the half-hour mark, however, a slow chant began for “I’m On a Boat,” the Lonely Island-penned number that might be T-Pain’s most recognized work.
Eventually, the request became so deafening that T-Pain complied and made an abrupt, unnatural segue into the song’s first verse, placating the gathered masses.
Even if T-Pain’s set benefited from a good balance of gusto and self-parody, the singer seemed to reach his limit of self-deprecation at this moment. For the remainder of the show, his performance felt deflated and unenthusiastic. But despite the crowds’ being electric with exaltation moments before, people were visibly disappointed when T-Pain made an abrupt exit near 10:30 p.m.
In retrospect, the selection of T-Pain for Springest’s headliner, while a polarizing choice, was absolutely necessary to inject some life into the event. But nature of that life remains questionable. The last-minute crowds that made it out for T-Pain’s set are, if anything, a clear indication that the age of irony is far from over.
There’s nothing wrong with appeasing such interest now and then, but for next year’s Springfest, Program Board would do well to consider pursuing acts that might remain relevant several years from the performance date. Clipse’s inclusion on this year’s bill and 2007’s Lupe Fiasco were each a step in the right direction. Even MGMT’s 2008 appearance on The Row remains a reminder of what USC can potentially pull off with its money and resources.
Who said T-Pain was awesome?  Were you there?  This guy and his music are both trash.  He made some vulgar comments about my mom and his penis.  Come on.
That’s frustrating to hear. KSCR doesn’t have anywhere close to the funds to pull off someone like 2006 LCD Soundsystem. 
I honestly think Concert Board is underestimating the turnout that somone like LCD or Animal Collective would bring out. It could be quite massive. Even for T-Pain, the crowd was definitely not as large as the one that showed up for Lupe (and he almost borders on indie.)
I tried to join the concerts board TWICE before I gave up. The first time was in 2006 when LCD Soundsystem was gaining popularity. Wanna know what the concert board told me?
“We aren’t interested in indie music.”
Maybe you all should start looking at the shows KSCR puts on instead. They bring over indie acts and non of this mainstream hip hop BS.
But seriously, for the amount of $$ USC paid for T-Pain, we could have had Animal Collective AND LCD Soundsystem, I bet.
T-Pain put on an amazing show. Even if you weren’t a fan you had to have been entertained. Oh and his DJ’s name is DJ Lil Boy not DJ  Louis..
T-Pain was weak. We really must do better than this. MGMT should have just come back and played another set. What about the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Animal Collective, LCD Soundsystem, the Roots. You know, someone good.
Spot On article…It felt awkward watching T Pain drown. And why was he dancing with a guy for the majority of the performance. Literally dancing with a guy. WTF?
“You’re gonna be my Noveau,” T-Pain said to the audience at one point
Nuvo. Its a vodka. Do some research or at least a google search.

If I had met Brigitta on the street and asked her for directions, I would’ve never known or even suspected what she did for a living.
Speaking more with her eyes than her voice, she exuded a polite reserve, contrary to the boisterous confidence I would’ve expected from a sex worker in Amsterdam. Although her appearance — scantily clad with stick straight hair and caked makeup — was an immediate giveaway of her profession, it provided only a superficial understanding.
During my last night in the city, I left my hostel naively thinking that if I knocked on enough doors and smiled as innocently as possible, I could convince at least one prostitute to take a couple of minutes off work to tell me her story, or at least bribe her to meet me after for a cup of coffee.
What I saw as an opportunity for an enlightening conversation, they saw as a waste of time, another minute they had to spend propping the door open for a penniless miscreant.
Even on a Sunday night, the cobbled streets of the Red Light District were bustling with people: groups of men standing outside dimly red-lit doors debating which ones to enter, girls giggling nervously as they quickened their pace past sultry women and even couples walking hand in hand trying their hardest not to point.
Like Brigitta, Amsterdam’s Red Light District transforms after sunset. Although even by day, you never forget that you’re looking at the physical manifestation of human vice, you get the distinct impression that there might be something more.
Walking through the neighborhood, I couldn’t ignore the shops filled with sex toys and the films with not very subtly nuanced titles like Soaking Wet and Liquor Store Lady, or the posters advertising peep shows for 2 euros ($2.69). But unexpectedly, there were also a good number of cafes and, ironically, at the heart of it all, a church.
Oude Kerk, translated as “Old Church,” got its name from — you guessed it — being the oldest church in Amsterdam. Back when pirates dominated the city, priests would forgive the seafaring rogues known for their proclivity to adult entertainment of their sins in exchange for a lump sum of money.
To the untrained eye, this unquestioning acceptance of vice might seem confusing or even shocking. According to our walking tour guide, however, the city’s liberality stems from a history built on three unofficial rules governing behavior.
Whatever extracurricular activities you choose to take part in — whether legal or not — should first and foremost be good for business. Your actions should not hurt anyone, and you should also practice discretion.
For the most part, the business that goes on inside the city’s Red Light District complies with these rules.
In terms of prostitution, the women pay their taxes, work with condoms and rent private rooms for the time they need, usually around four to six hours. When a shift is over, the women draw the curtains and close up shop until they feel like working again.
With a friend trailing closely behind, I walked up to the first window on the main thoroughfare where a blonde bombshell stared back at me in confusion, probably because of my gender. After a hopeful introduction and brief proposition, I was stiffly rebuffed.
The next window proved no better. As soon as the woman saw me approaching, she yanked the curtains closed in a practiced motion. I can only assume that she received my casual smile and unassuming wave as a boorish grin and an undesired entreaty.
After about 10 minutes and a nasty rejection from a portly black woman, I quickly learned that if I wanted conversation, I would have to fork up the money.
In general, if you want to hire a prostitute for a baseline 15-minute session, prepare to invest 50 euros ($67.28). Anything more than just the usual, and you’ll have to pay an even higher price tag, depending on the complexity of the act.
The women in the red light district are of all nationalities, shapes and ages, with the youngest prostitute I saw being 18 years old and the oldest, who comes with a waiting list, being 72 years old. Many don’t speak English and most, understandably, don’t like to talk about their work during their off-hours.
As I walked off the main road into a quieter passageway, I tried, yet again, to work my powers of persuasion. Finally, I met Brigitta.
At 20, Brigitta left her hometown in Hungary with her friends. Until her funds ran low, she never imagined that she would end up being one of the women tapping on glass window doors, hoping to catch a man’s attention with a flip of her hair and a seductive smile.
But before I could prompt her for more, she told me she was still on the clock and suggested that I come back after her shift was over.
About an hour later, I went back, finding only a locked door and darkness peeking from beneath the drawn curtains. Although I knocked, no one came out.
Though I felt slightly disappointed about my failed rendezvous, I can’t say I was surprised. If there’s anything I’ve learned in Amsterdam, it’s that you might be able to look through the glass doors at any given time, but it’ll take more than just a kind smile to be invited inside.

I agree with Joe – if you want an interview with a hooker, you must pony up the cash and you’ll get it in no time.
Also, €50 for 15 minutes (sex or talk – doesn’t matter) is a typical rip-off those chicks do to anyone new to the place. If you act clueless, they WILL milk you dry. I suggest you read The Red Light District Guide (the only good source of inside information on the District that I’ve found online). Among other things, it will teach you exactly what to do and what to say in order to get a longer time slot with lower price (again, it doesn’t matter whether it’s an interview or an intercourse).
You know… they *are* available for hire. Even in the US, it’s not illegal to pay an “escort” to spend time giving you an interview. Pony up the cash and maybe you’ll get your story.
Maybe I’m wrong but it seems to me from reading your article that you want to write a positive article about sex workers and want to interview one. If so that is great.
As a guess some of these women might be really sick of people putting down their profession and making them out to be victims. Instead of viewing them as providing a valuable service.
If you let them know that up front you might get one to talk to you. Let them know you are not there to vilify their customers or put down their profession by making them out to be a bunch of  drug addicted 12 year olds trafficked into slavery.

Walking around USC you might not expect to find a room full of female Trojans in various states of undress. But Saturday at the Radisson Hotel, student hopefuls posed for world famous centerfold photographer Arny Freytag and Playboy representative Eden Orfanos for a chance to one day add “Bunny” to their résumés.
As part of their “Girls of the Pac-10” issue, which has been a tradition since 1976, Playboy scoured the West coast searching for — according to the press release — “the sexiest, most beautiful women of the Pacific-10 Conference.” Playboy holds auditions at each school and, starting this year, meets the women in person to set up their “illustrious annual college girls pictorial.” Of course, this includes USC.
“Last year, we didn’t go to the schools — we just had girls send in their pictures,” Orfanos said.
Having the women send in topless photos, however, created an explosion of applicants, and this year’s decision to travel to the campuses and meet potential models was based on practicality.
For many of the young women who pose for Playboy, it is their first time modeling and having guidance helps.
“It’s my duty to work through and teach the girls,” Freytag explained.
So why would a USC student try out for Playboy in the first place? Posing nude for a male magazine seems like a slippery slope. Men justify looking at Playboy by saying they “only read the articles” and women put down the “perfect” body type that Playboy proliferates.
But undeclared freshman Sarah Hoffman sees trying out for a spot in the magazine as more of a personal choice than anything else.
“I did it to complete my metamorphosis into a self-confident woman,” she said.
She said part of the challenge for her was not letting other people dissuade her. But when it came to the opinions of her parents, things were a little trickier.
Unlike the regular-issue Playboy models, Hoffman — and the other young women who arrived at the auditions — are still students.
“If I was really intent on doing it, then they would support me,” Hoffman said.
Orfanos said that Playboy has been a magazine where young women can get a toe-hold in the modeling industry, and it’s an opportunity for them to become entrepreneurs in their own lives.
Much like Hoffman, who said she does auditions “all the time,” Orfanos reiterated that women who come to Playboy often go on to be models or actresses.
“Playboy can act as a springboard for girls,” Orfanos said, suggesting the magazine can empower them. “Women come to us.”
Playboy has long been a place where any woman can come and make her own name. In fact, the idea that any woman can get recognition in a national magazine — as opposed to only celebrities — is a pillar that the magazine is built on.
If the intent of the publication is to showcase women, it’s no surprise, then, that Playboy has tapped the co-ed population.
“It’s the girl next door [idea],” Fretyag said. “That’s the philosophy the magazine started with. She’s someone you know from home. Every guy thinks they can meet that girl.”
Although Playboy does showcase famous actresses and models, it is known as a magazine filled with girls who aren’t celebrities.
“Hugh Hefner started by shooting his own secretary,” Freytag said of the Playboy founder and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises’ initial forays into the world of publishing. “That’s what jumpstarted the magazine.”
Playboy’s Pac-10 romp to recruit college women could be interpreted as unabashedly exploitative, with Playboy taking advantage of the young women of USC to sell magazines. Conversely, some might see the magazine’s decision to recruit from universities as refreshing, because the magazine wants to show off smart, college-educated women as objects of male desire.
While there’s definitely a thin line between what is considered pornography versus what is art, Orfanos thinks that sexuality can be depicted through beautiful photographs and that much of what Playboy shows is art.
The fact that the Pac-10 issues began during the height of the ‘70s feminist movement isn’t just coincidence, he said.
“Hefner knew that guys wanted girls with brains,” Freytag said. “That’s when they started the college girls issue.”
Whichever way one chooses to look at it, there is no doubt that Playboy is a business-savvy magazine that knows who its consumers are.
Whether it plays to the desire for smart women, girls next door or someone who is just drop-dead sexy, Playboy is in tune with what men want — and it embodies the cliché marketing phrase “sex sells,” which has driven the magazine’s success and made it so taboo.
Christy Hefner left Playboy in ’09, to go on to do ‘more  meaningful’ things. And Playboy is in trouble, closing down it’s N.Y. offices…did she jump ship before it gets worse?
 Rumor has it that her husband, an Illinois real estate investor/ lawyer and former Illinois politico, may have future  political aspirations (they are both  friends of Obama), and his wife, being CEO of Playboy, would not bode well for any future political career he may be interested in pursuing. .
The woman running the company is Hugh Heffner’s daughter.. He hired her, upon her request,   to run the company after she graduated, a business major. Probably to make up for his horribly negligent job of fathering (too busy with his multiple bunny partners?), and barely seeing her throughout her childhood. Doubt if many other smart business women would be that nterested in his company. Doubt if he would have hired his daughter to pose nude in his centerfolds..or maybe he would…..since she has a college degree..
Why do you specualte in other people’s family life, and judge, based more on your own prejudice towards the company rather than any acutal facts?
Also dont forget that playboy is run by a woman.
I dont understand why its “disgusting” that men “drool” over women in playboy. Or how it would be disgusting if men drooled over you. You dont want men to find you attractive?  And seriously, by going after college girls, I dont think Playboy shows that it is somehow more sophisticated, but it attracts more college readers. Men like women. Men like to look at beautiful women. Women are not objects, women are women and we love them for it :)
In defense of this writer..who is not responsible for Playboy coming to USC… as gross as that may be to some..and yet others feel it is just all a-o-k for college girls to pose nude and have the freedom to do whatever they want..no matter the possible repercussions for them in their futures, making such stupid choices now….but, hey, it is THEIR lives…….Obviously, from the comments here there is a broad range of differing opinions…But I don’t think it was the writer’s job  to take sides about The Playboy casting event. I did not feel it was P.R for Playboy at all..rather quite neutral and that was good. . Was it supposed to be investigative journalism ? In the Lifestyle section?  If readers want a more biased, opinionated article then   look for that in the Opinion Section  of a newspaper. Maybe write that yourself….like why would USC allow them anywhere near their campus??
The article succeeds in remaining neutral, not condoning or criticizing this “event”.
As far as SAFETY issues…I wish USC would not allow Playboy anywhere near campus..do this in their own offices far away from college campuses..in a hotel?? I don’t know if I buy the ‘ploy’ of coming TO or near campus due to receiving SO many pictures through the mail, and this was to narrow it down, to simplify it… Sounds more like  they set up in a hotel near campus to get MORE girls, like the ones who may not have had the time to have pictures taken and send them in, can just show up to a ‘cattle call’ disrobe, let this guy ‘teach them’ to pose nude (ugh!)..take pictures and ‘audition’ that way.. USC should be on top of this kind of thing. At least send out some kind of warnings for the safety of the students.The Radisson is still close enough to campus for them to do that…..You NEVER go to a hotel for an audition..and this one, where it was probably a ‘cattle call’, the ‘auditioners’ were probably not  submitted by agents or managers, who would have done the work leading up to the audition,  knowing the people there,  the legitimacy, etc. and even then many times agents will not allow  potential employers to interview/audition their clients  in a HOTEL… ..And this involved nudity??  And then this guy, this STRANGER,  is going to ‘teach’ them how to pose nude? Girls are you kidding me??   You dont  go to a hotel for any audition unless your agent or manager knows everything there is to know about it, the people, the circumstances, etc. and even then it is risky.  So having these girls go to a hotel to disrobe and pose nude,  instead of Playboy offices sounds weird and risky..
And ofcourse Heffner wants educated women for his rag..and ofcourse he would seek out college girls at the height of the feminist movement..to show that no matter how educated or how far women may have come, they
are still nothing but  sexual objects to be used and exploited for male readers to drool over .. That  his rag is not just filled with Bimbos who have nothing else in their sad lives, no futures of any importance at all,  except boobs and bodies and stupidly see this as their  ticket out of their sad and dreary   lives. And to them this is their biggest dream come true, because they have nothing else and know nothing else. By going after college educated women Heffner adds  respect and clout to his magazine, the girls are not ALL dumb.
And there are much better ways to get into modeling and/or acting. This is L.A…get headshots, get an agent and audition for more respected legitimate work.  This is the lowest level of the business. There may be alot of money involved but no one will take you seriously and this will follow you for the rest of your life. It is a very tough image to shed.
 USC students might be in a position to RUN a company like Playboy, but don’t allow yourselves to be sexually exploited by it.
It’s sickening to think that such a high caliber university as ours still has girls who are willing to sell their bodies. USC should expel each girl that participates in this disgusting and exploitative act.
No University can control what its students do. Posing nude for playboy isn’t illegal. But they are taking a huge risk.
J: You must think it is really weird: almost as if people had their own free will and were allowed to do what they want to do with themselves. Or as if there existed a document called, I dont know maybe, a “constitution” saying that all people are “born free” to express this really crazy idea that people can do what they want with their lives. Its really weird, dont you think?
They’re called legacies
And being in Playboy won’t make you a self-confident woman. It will plague you for the rest of your life when you try to get jobs. Simple Google searches will bring you up.
This article was so poorly written anyway. It was more of a PR piece for Playboy than a real investigative piece of journalism. I would have talked to the girls that tried out way more than talking about the Playboy empire. Most people know that history already.
I agree. It really isn’t too hard to imagine why Playboy would want to come to USC to find models to pose for them. The real question is why some people spend 200k on an education when all they really want to do is use Playboy as a “springboard” toward a career in modeling/acting. That’s the one I hoped this article would answer. I can imagine that it might have been difficult to get girls to comment in the school newspaper about why they were auditioning for Playboy, but then that’s also a huge question to address, which it wasn’t.
Being in Playboy does not make someone a “Bunny.” Bunnies are the girls who worked at the clubs, when teh original clubs closed they were playmates who did special promotional work. Now that there is again a club, it is staffed by Bunnies. Please know the difference.
WHATEVER.

Now that Wahoo’s Fish Taco is slated to move to the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center, USC Hospitality is on the hunt for a restaurant to take its place in Café 84.
Hospitality announced last Monday that Wahoo’s, one of the most popular restaurants in Café 84, will move to the new campus center in August. Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said Wahoo’s will likely be replaced by a Mexican restaurant.
Wahoo · The popular restaurant Wahoo’s Fish Taco will be moving from Café 84 to the Ronald Tutor Campus Center when it opens in August. Its replacement will most likely be a Mexican restaurant. - Youli Zheng | Daily Trojan
“At this point, we’re still working with the new restaurant, and I can’t say for certain because we have no signed contract yet,” Klinger said. “But we’re careful to choose dining options that we feel will resonate well with the students. Student surveys showed first a need for a Greek option, which we gave them, and a Mexican option, which we’re working on now.”
Café 84 was remodeled at the beginning of the spring semester, when Daphne’s Greek Café and Wasabi Sushi were brought in to give students a wider variety of options and easier access to international cuisine.
Klinger could not say which restaurants in particular are being considered for Wahoo’s soon-to-be vacant spot, but he said Hospitality is aiming to introduce a Mexican option to Café 84. Mexican, Klinger said, was one of the most requested types of food.
Klinger said Hospitality chose to move Wahoo’s because of its popularity.
“It was agreed at the time [between USC Hospitality and the executives of Wahoo’s] that Wahoo’s should be relocated to the new campus center once it was finished. When [the campus center] opens, it will be a premier location on campus,” Klinger said. “Wahoo’s has always been very popular — Pete Carroll and the football team were always big fans of Wahoo’s — and we feel it should be in the most central location.”
Students said they are glad to see Wahoo’s move to the center of campus.
“It makes sense to put Wahoo’s in the new student center,” said Michele Malkasian, a junior majoring in communication. “There will probably be a lot of traffic going through there, so it will be more readily available to students. People will be there a lot more than Café 84.”
Chris Rayon, a freshman majoring in philosophy, agreed.
“Café 84 is pretty far away from a lot of the dorms,” he said. “It will be nice to have Wahoo’s in the middle of campus where we’re around it more often.”
Glad to hear that Wahoo’s Fish Tacos is remaining on campus.  Thanks for the grinds.
What a boss.
Ahhh, now I know why admissions are up here at SC!

Though hours at the University Park Health Center and Lyon Center remain the same and students still can’t use paper tickets to get into football games, outgoing Undergraduate Student Government President Holden Slusher and Vice President Ashlie Chan say they are satisfied with their accomplishments, which include starting a free tram to L.A. Live and improving communication with students.
When they ran for office last spring, Slusher and Chan had a number of ideas they hoped would improve student life at USC. Slusher said he feels his administration managed to complete a majority of those tasks, and the rest he hopes will be continued by the next administration.
“I’m really happy with everything that we’ve accomplished,” Slusher said. “We worked on everything on our platform and those that were not finished were passed off. I’m really proud of everyone we worked with.”
The highlights of Slusher’s administration include getting a USC tram to run between the school and L.A. Live and improving USG’s visibility among students. The tram, which began running in November, offers students free transportation to the popular Downtown destination and has been utilized by many students since its inception.
To improve USG’s visibility, Slusher and Chan conducted a number of student surveys, tabled on Trousdale Parkway and hosted the Council of Presidents, a meeting that gave student leaders a chance to ask USG questions.
Several of Slusher and Chan’s platform points, however, did not come to fruition.
Initially, Slusher and Chan had hoped to expand the hours of the health center and the Lyon Center, but the university lacked the resources to hire more staff and told USG the plan wasn’t feasible.
“It’s not financially viable,” Helen Moser, USG director of campus affairs, said. “If we were to extend the hours, then it would take away from necessary things that students need … Compared to other schools, our hours of the health center is one of the best in the country.”
Chan noted, however, that USG has set up meetings between students and administrators to discuss a three-year plan that might involve extending the Lyon Center’s hours.
Other tasks USG had a tough time accomplishing were getting USCards accepted at local businesses, creating a paper ticket option for sporting events and adding more computers to USC’s libraries.
Chan said that in many cases USG hit administrative or bureaucratic roadblocks in trying to create significant changes around campus.
She did note, however, that the next administration will continue working to create a paper ticket option.
Another task the new administration will have the chance to finish is increasing library security, including adding turnstiles to the entrance of Leavey.
“The libraries were a little bit slow on that,” Chan said. “We will see more turnstiles and safety precautions taken by next year.”
Slusher and Chan had also hoped to repave The Row. Greek Senators Hayden Coplen, Dylan Dan and Max Ukropina were heading this issue but found some major roadblocks as they researched the project.
“Until The Row shuts down, we can’t repave it because it’s just going to get worse and worse and worse,” Chan said. “By the time we have a repaved street, it’s just going to go back to the same status as it was before. We can’t repave a lot of the streets until we find solutions to making The Row safer … We would not be able to do anything unless we appealed to the L.A. city, which makes it more of a challenge to get accomplished.”
Altogether, USG under Slusher and Chan spent approximately $1.72 million from their $1.8 million budget. Treasurer Ashwin Appiah noted that they saved a lot of money during elections, and whenever they considered spending money, they made sure that it would go back to the student body.
“We didn’t want to spend money just because we had it,” Appiah said. “We think before we spend and we see if it goes back to the student body, and if it doesn’t, then we double-think about what we’re using the money for.”
Although Slusher and Chan did not accomplish all the items on their platform, Chan said she does not consider them failures because changing circumstances might provide opportunities to complete those items.
“We had really lofty goals because if everyone keeps saying ‘no,’ then no change is going to get done,” Chan said. “If we found a compromise then it’s a success in itself.”
Chan said the only regret she has is not starting certain projects sooner.
“Hindsight is 20/20,” Chan said. “There are only so many things that we can do at one time, so, if anything, maybe we should have done some of these things faster or sooner, but there was really no way we could have measured that.”
Chan said she and Slusher are pleased with what they accomplished.
“I think it was very smart for us to anticipate that our goals were lofty but feasible,” Chan said. “The ultimate goal was to accomplish everything, and I think we tried our best.”

The USC College Democrats held an awards ceremony Sunday to honor former California State Assembly Speaker Karen Bass.
Bass, who is currently running for Congress, was given the Jesse M. Unruh Award to honor her commitment to the Democratic Party and the state of California. The award, named after former California state Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh, is given annually by the USC College Democrats to local politicians who have demonstrated exemplary service.

“We like [to choose] people with connections to USC who have done a lot of great work for California and for the Democratic Party,” said Bobby Almeida, president of the USC College Democrats.
Bass graduated from the USC Keck School of Medicine’s Primary Care Physician Assistant Program and worked for years as a physician assistant before pursuing politics.
Bass had planned to attend the ceremony, but was pulled away at the last minute because of extenuating circumstances. She was represented by her senior adviser, Sylvia Castillo, who accepted the award on her behalf.
“I thank you all on behalf of the speaker for honoring her hard work,” she said.
Castillo spoke about Bass’ accomplishments and goals and her reasons for running for Congress this year.
Also at the event was James Westbrooks, the district director for California state Sen. Curren Price.
Westbrooks spoke on behalf of the senator and told the students he would try to set up a meeting with the USC College Democrats as soon as possible so they could get a chance to speak with the senator.
Sunday’s event, which was attended by approximately 30 people, also served as a fundraiser for the College Democrats. Money was raised by donations from elected officials, as well as some attendees.
“We hope to raise a little over $1,000,” Almeida said.
The USC College Democrats have used money from previous fundraisers to organize events on campus and travel around the country.
“The money is for our club so we can do things like canvas in Nevada, like we did in the 2008 election,” said Aja Heisler, director of external communications for the USC College Democrats.
The majority of the attendees were members of the USC College Democrats. Students from UCLA also attended.
“We tried to publicize the best we could,” Heisler said. “We really wanted to give USC students a chance to come out and meet Karen Bass.”
Jonathan Brebner, a current member of the USC College Democrats, said he was extremely excited his club was honoring Bass.
“I never even considered missing it,” said Brebner, a junior majoring in political science.
Brebner said he is very happy about the work that Bass did during her term as California assembly speaker.
“I think [Karen Bass] is a fantastic politician,” Brebner said. “She did her job well.”

Over the past few months, 8,500 high school seniors have received the happy news that they have been accepted to USC. About 1,000 others, though, received slightly different letters — they have been admitted, but not for the fall.
Instead of using a waitlist, USC chooses to admit a handful of students for the spring semester.
Some of these students are eventually bumped to fall admission, but many, if they choose to attend USC, have to wait an extra four months to begin their college experience.
For prospective Trojans, being admitted for the spring is often bittersweet.
Catherine Sutcliff, a high school senior from Georgia who was admitted for the spring 2011 semester, said she was initially taken aback.
“It makes choosing what to do next year a lot harder,” Sutcliff said. “I was angry at first, before I realized that I was at least fortunate enough to be offered a spot. I finally realized that if I turned down my first-choice school then I would always be wondering ‘what if’ and regretting not waiting until the spring.”
Another spring admit, Betsy Schull, had similar feelings.
“I was so excited because USC was my number one school. When I discovered my admission was for spring, I was pretty upset,” Schull said. “But after talking to current USC students about my situation, it helped me to know that other people successfully started in the spring and were still able to make friends and get the necessary amount of credits to graduate on time.”
Schull said she wants to attend USC, but the decision is harder now that she would be starting in the spring.
“If I had been accepted regularly, I would have most likely chosen USC. If I do choose to attend, it would be because I am absolutely in love with USC,” she said. “My decision hinges on me finding something worthwhile and productive to do in the fall without overstepping my financial boundaries.”
Sutcliff said that although she has the option to attend the University of Georgia for free, she thinks there are better opportunities at USC.
“If I chose the easy option and just went to UGA, it would be a lot like high school, and I wouldn’t gain any new perspectives,” she said.
Past spring admits who have chosen to attend USC said they think waiting is worth it, although it does alter the college experience.
Kevin Steen, a freshman majoring in linguistics, said he is happy he chose to attend USC as a spring admit for both academic and financial reasons.
“I’m glad I’m here as opposed to other places because there are so many more opportunities here,” Steen said. “I’m also glad being a spring admit because I saved money.”
Annie Biggs, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the school’s location and the Marshall School of Business made waiting an extra semester worth it.
“This is the place for me,” Biggs said. “Because of the opportunities that USC offers their students, I don’t think other schools compete. Also, it’s a city full of opportunities, and, of course, Marshall has a great business program.”
Other students, however, expressed some regrets about waiting the extra semester to attend USC.
Matt Herrick, a freshman majoring in communication, said that looking back, his other options seem appealing.
“I kind of regret not going to University of British Columbia,” he said. “That would have been a cool experience.”
Herrick said the transition to USC in the spring was harder than expected.
“[At USC], we didn’t get an adequate welcome initially,” he said.
Herrick noted, however, that as the semester has progressed, he has felt more comfortable pursuing his academic and social interests.
“The academics here are so much harder than what I’ve been exposed to in the past, but the communication school is a lot more diverse and gives you more freedom,” Herrick said. “Socially, it felt like I wasn’t really associating with everybody at first. But through clubs, it’s just getting better the more I’m here.”
Other students also said the transition was somewhat difficult, but for different reasons.
Biggs, who went to Nicaragua for three months to do community service during her semester off, said the transition back to the United States was hard.
“It was a bit of a culture shock going from Nicaragua to L.A., but in terms of transitioning from high school to college, it was smooth,” Biggs said.
Steen was also worried the transition would be hard, but noted that he wasn’t worried for long.
“At first, I was nervous that being spring admit would mean not fitting in with everybody,” he said. “There were so many spring admits, though, and the friends I made here were very helpful.”
Steen said that he made a lot of friends at the spring admit orientation.
“I have a tough time remembering who is a spring admit or fall admit, which is kind of cool. USC has a really good support system,” Steen said.
Spring admits can be a good thing – especially for those who want to save money!  You know you are going to USC, so all you have to do is sign up for GenEd classes at your local community college for the summer and fall semesters and transfer those units to USC and “voila”, you saved at least $25,000!!!
And…if you were planning ahead in High School and took AP courses that count for GenEd credit and Elective credit, then you saved $55,000!!!
And…at the end of the Spring semester you may have earned more credits than the Fall admit freshmen, so you will get priority registration on top of that!
Why the sloppy reception? Just make it an all or nothing deal. This stupid tiered admission is just that–stupid. When you apply to universities you should take everything lightly and wear thick skin. You’re going to get rejection letters, I don’t care if you got perfect SAT scores and rank #1 in your senior class and you inundated your personal statement with all your extracirricular activities.
Even the most competitive students who are de facto Ivy-material get the “little letter” (not big package) in the mail reading: Adrian, we know you’re a bright student, but Ivy college here does not have the capacity to serve you. We regret it and know that you will be a positive contribution to society no matter which college you choose to attend. Please do not come anywhere near our campus, othewise campus police, the bomb squad, and a sniper team will await you. ;)
Great article, Stephen! :)

The road woes continued for the Trojans men’s volleyball team who have lost five of its last seven matches away from the Galen Center after falling to top-ranked Stanford Saturday night.
Drawn out · Junior outside hitter Murphy Troy had 34 kills in the Trojans’ five set affair with Pacific on Friday. Troy also recorded 12 digs. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports information 
With the season winding down, the Trojans (14-10, 11-9) appeared to have finally found some momentum. They beat Pacific on the road on Friday, matching their longest winning streak of the season at four games and clinching a berth in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
However, the Cardinal (18-5, 15-5) handily swept the No. 6 Trojans (30-23, 30-24, 30-15).
In the first two sets against Stanford, USC had some success, tying the first set at nine and leading the second set 14-7 before the Cardinal regained control.
“There were a few questionable calls that I think we reacted to a little bit too much,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “But I think the games were a lot closer than the scores indicated, except for the third set. In the first two sets, I think we did some things really well.”
Sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli had a team-high 14 kills and four blocks against Stanford. Junior setter Riley McKibbin added nine digs.
On Friday, against Pacific (8-20, 0-20), the Trojans overcame a two-set deficit (24-30, 24-30, 30-25, 30-20, 15-12) by successfully tinkering with their lineup.
In the third set, Ferguson inserted sophomore Steven Shandrick for junior Austin Zahn at middle blocker and senior Tyler Stevens for junior Sean Dennis at outside hitter. Shandrick proceeded to record eight blocks, and Stevens had a career-high seven digs.
“Pacific was hot the first two sets,” Ferguson said. “We got a little out of rhythm the first two sets. In the third, fourth and fifth sets, we were in really good control. I was happy with the way we played.”
Ciarelli had 14 kills against Pacific to complement his career-high nine blocks. Senior middle blocker Hunter Current hit a match-high .529, recorded 12 kills and a career-best 10 blocks.
Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy continued the success he has had since coach Ferguson tweaked the offense earlier this season. After being named the MPSF Co-Player of the Week, Troy had 12 digs and a career-high 34 kills against Pacific. He also had six digs and nine kills against Stanford.
The Trojans have two more games and two weeks of practices to get ready for the MPSF tournament.
“We are looking to improve in everything,” Ferguson said. “We are working on some new concepts with blocking and defense. Offensively, our numbers have skyrocketed from where they were a month ago, so if we can continue that improvement, I think that will be a really good thing for us.”
The Trojans conclude their regular season with road matches against No. 14 UCSD on Friday and No. 8 Long Beach State on Saturday before participating in the MPSF tournament.
great article.  we will get better. and with the MPSF do or die for Troy…just hope we do not open at BYU or Hawaii.
we should finish 6th in Mpsf…so we play the #3seed….
Hopefully CSUN or Pepperdine,…
we can beat them, eventhough we have lost 15?straight to CSUN….
Believe in this team…..there is plenty of talent and heart.
Experience form last year’s run to the FINAL>>>>>  set hartbreak…loss to UCI.
Stanford is clear fave to be #1 seed…and host qtr, semi, & final of MPSF…
as well as final four May 6th & 8th…
If we finsih 6 and beat the #3seed.  then we play the winner of #2 v. #7.    We will be playing at Maples in Palo Alto and we can win there……

Sometimes you run into a hot team on a winning streak, and there’s nothing you can do. But when you give away outs and don’t get timely hitting, it becomes nearly impossible to win.
That was the case over the weekend for the USC baseball team. California improved its winning streak to eight games by sweeping a three-game set from USC (15-17, 2-7).
In the finale Sunday, the Trojans fell 4-3 as they filed to push across the game-tying run in the eighth inning when they stranded a pair of runners despite having men on first and third with only one out.
After junior infielder Joe De Pinto and freshman pinch hitter Cade Kreuter walked to lead off the eighth inning, USC got back-to-back singles by sophomore infielder Matt Foat and sophomore designated hitter Brandon Garcia, but junior third baseman Matt Hart struck out and senior center fielder Mike O’Neill flew out.
Cal (20-10, 6-3) took a quick 1-0 lead on first baseman Mark Canha’s fourth extra base of the series. Canha rocketed a fastball to dead center field just to the left of the 395-foot marker for a solo home run.
Hart tied the game in the bottom of the second inning with an RBI-single to center field, scoring Foat, who led off the inning with a single past the first baseman.
Stringing together three singles and then taking advantage of a pair of hit batsmen, Cal scored two runs in the fourth and added another in the sixth to make it 4-1 prior to the eighth inning drama. Brian Guinn collected his seventh hit and fourth RBI of the series scoring Marcus Semien with a single to center field.
USC had its worst defensive performance of the season Friday night, committing six errors. The Trojan pitching was just as bad allowing 18 hits — two shy of the season-high.
Sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa put USC ahead with a three-run homer as the Trojans took a 4-1 lead, but it was short-lived.
Senior Kevin Couture gave up three runs in the second inning to tie the game. He then failed to make it out of the third inning. Cal scored six runs to take a commanding 10-4 lead. The Golden Bears added another four runs, taking advantage of USC’s defensive and pitching struggles before the Trojans showed some life in the seventh inning.
They scored five runs to cut the lead to 14-9, highlighted by sophomore Taylor Wrenn’s three-run blast to right-center — his first home run as a Trojan. But that’s as close as they would get as Cal added two runs to make the final tally 16-9.
Cal’s Erik Johnson picked up the win improving to 5-1 while Kevin Couture fell to 2-1 on the season.
It was more of the same on Saturday. USC was hurt by defensive lapses and couldn’t come up with the timely hits as they fell 7-1.
After an error kept the fifth inning alive, Cal was able to score three runs taking advantage of another error and a passed ball. It added a run the next inning and then forced sophomore starter Ben Mount from the game in the seventh inning after Guinn singled home Jimmy Bosco to make the score 5-0.
The Golden Bears tacked on another pair of runs in the inning on a two-run double by Canha. USC added a single run in the bottom of the seventh inning on a Joe De Pinto fielder’s choice, but it was all they could scrape across against Cal starter Justin Jones.
Jones improved to 7-2 despite pitching from the stretch for the majority of the afternoon, allowing nine hits and two walks.
De Pinto, Foat and Kreuter all recorded multi-hit games, but the Trojans could never get the clutch hits, leaving eight men on base.
USC will now have four days to prepare for next weekend’s trip to Arizona State, who was No. 1 in the nation entering the weekend and is currently tied with Cal for first place in the Pac-10 standings.

The No. 17 women’s tennis team can celebrate a weekend sweep after defeating both No. 56 Arizona, 7-0, and No. 21 Arizona State, 5-2.
In Saturday’s match against Arizona, the Women of Troy (13-7, 5-1) largely dominated the competition, winning all six singles matches in two sets.
Teamwork · Sophomore Alison Ramos and freshman Valeria Pulido struggled in their doubles match against Arizona State, but easily captured a doubles victory against Arizona at Marks Stadium on Saturday. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The greatest suspense could be found in the first singles slot, where No. 2 junior Maria Sanchez from USC faced off against No. 105 Natasha Marks. By the time all the other matches were over, the two were only in the fourth game of the second set, as many of the games went to deuce multiple times.
Buoyed by vocal support from the crowd and her teammates, Sanchez ended up winning in two sets, 6-1, 6-3, but it was not an easy victory. In fact, Sanchez was down 1-2 in the second set before pulling ahead.
“It was definitely a tough match,” Sanchez said. “I knew I just had to fight for every point because it wasn’t going to come easy, so I felt lucky to have won the way I did.”
The only loss on the day for the Women of Troy came in the No. 3 doubles match. Senior Sarah Fansler and junior Lyndsay Kinstler were up 7-3 against Marks and her partner Debora Castany, but the duo from Arizona was able to fight back and eventually beat the Trojans in a tiebreak.
Despite the disappointing finish, both quickly bounced back. In their singles matches, Fansler won in two sets, 6-1, 6-1, while Kinstler won the first set, 6-1, before winning all six games in the second.
On Friday, USC came away with the victory against Arizona State. The win came almost a month after the Sun Devils defeated USC in Tempe, Ariz.
“I think all of us came in really pumped and really ready to get them back for the loss that we had to them a month ago,” freshman Danielle Lao said.
However, importance of the match stretched beyond just beating the Sun Devils.
“It was a huge match for the Pac-10s and for the rankings … I’m really glad we got our revenge,” said sophomore Alison Ramos.
While Ramos showed a lot of excitement regarding the team’s victory, she also acknowledged the struggles she and partner freshman Valeria Pulido had in their doubles match.
“We definitely didn’t return as well because both our opponents served really well,” Ramos said.
While Ramos and Pulido lost, USC won its other doubles matches but had to come back from early deficits in order to do so. Fansler and Kinstler were down 2-0 early, while Sanchez and Lao fought back after being down 5-3.
The Women of Troy next hit the courts Friday on the road against crosstown rival UCLA.
This team has some cuties on it.

A small group of USC track and field athletes competed solidly at this weekend’s Pomona-Pitzer Invitational, with Trojans on both the men’s and women’s team scoring first place finishes.
Leaper · Sophomore Dalilah Muhammad won the high jump.  - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
USC also posted collegiate-best marks in seven events at the meet in Claremont, Calif.
Especially impressive was the performance of USC’s field athletes. Senior Colin Campbell won the men’s discus competition, and redshirt sophomore Lauren Guerrieri won the same event for the women.
Sophomore Dalilah Muhammad, usually one of USC’s best hurdlers, competed in Saturday’s high jump competition and came away with first place, clearing a season-best 5-8 3/4 inches.
Despite the late scratch of sophomore Duane Walker in the men’s 400-meter hurdles, the USC track athletes also had a memorable day at Pomona-Pitzer. Junior Brendan Ames honored his No. 1 seed in the men’s 110-meter hurdles by winning with a final time of 13.81 with a 2.1 meters per second backwind. The time was Ames’ best of the 2010 season.
A pieced-together 4×100-meter relay team took home the gold for the Trojans, as the team of junior Sean Jackson, sophomores Scott DeYoung and Tony Burnett, and freshman Farzad Bozorgzad finished with a time of 41.72.
Several Trojans fell just short of finishing first overall in their respective events. Junior Christine Cortez had a strong showing for the women’s distance team, coming in second overall in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:11.91, which was still good enough for the best collegiate time in the race.
For the men, senior Jason Price also finished second overall but first collegiately in the 400-meter dash with a season-best 48.16.
Next up for the Trojans are the Mount Sac Relays, a competition-heavy meet in Walnut, Calif., that earlier this week USC coach Ron Allice said was “one of the higher-profile meets on [the Trojans’] schedule.”

For the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team, winning has become rather customary this season, further evidenced by the Women of Troy’s shellacking of No. 9 Arizona State in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play on Saturday afternoon.
Playing in its first road game since late February, USC (18-1, 4-1) got off to a hot start on the offensive end and subsequently cruised to a 14-5 victory over host Sun Devils (15-11, 0-6) — the team’s 16th consecutive win.
“We talk about getting off to good starts with our press defense,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said, in the wake of the team’s impressive performance. “That helps us get fast break opportunities, which lead to goals. The girls did a great job of that all game.”
One of the key performers happened to be senior driver Kally Lucas, who netted two goals early in the first period before finishing with an impressive total of four, as her offensive abilities helped jumpstart the team early.
“[Lucas] was on fire today,” Vavic added. “She performed better than she has most of the season. She really did a great job of putting the ball in the corner of the nets on all her shots.”
But the senior driver wasn’t the only one to get in a rhythm offensively during the early minutes of the outing. After keeping Arizona State off the scoreboard until the early minutes of the second period, USC reeled off six straight goals to take an 8-1 lead midway through the third period with the help of junior driver Joelle Bekhazi, who recorded two of her three goals during that stretch.
But even in the midst of the Women of Troy’s offensive fireworks, which continued until the final buzzer sounded, the defense took center stage as usual.
The Sun Devils, who rank third in the conference in scoring, found the net just twice in the first three periods against USC’s seasoned senior goalie Tumua Anae, who reminded fans why she is a reigning first-team All-American.
Finishing the afternoon with seven saves, Anae stopped several potential Sun Devil goals that could have swung the momentum in the opposite direction.
“[Anae] had some really good saves and stopped a lot of potential goals,” Vavic said. “Overall, we were pretty solid. [Bekhzi] was really good in two-meter defense and so were others. I think our depth really showed today.”
A strong defensive front made life a little easier for Anae, as its stifling nature severely limited the Sun Devils’ ability to get any shots on goal.
But in the meanwhile, Arizona State was eventually able to tack on three additional goals in the final period, including two from freshman center Shannon Haas, who is unsurprisingly among the MPSF’s leaders in scoring.
But while the offensive surge helped make the score a bit more respectable, it was too little too late as the often demanding Vavic was more than pleased with the team’s road win one week before its crosstown showdown against rival UCLA.
“We have a lot of work to do and we need to prepare, but the UCLA game will be really fun, especially for our seniors,” Vavic said. “It’s going to be a fight.”

The No. 3 USC men’s tennis team continued its command of the Pac-10 and won at least a share of the conference championship Friday in Tucson, Ariz.
Poise · Despite being down a break, sophomore Daniel Nguyen and freshman J.T. Sundling were able to capture a hard-fought 8-6 victory. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (19-2, 5-0) swept No. 35 Arizona (12-9, 1-4) 7-0 to remain the only undefeated team in conference play with one dual match left in the regular season against No. 10 UCLA (13-5, 3-1).
At minimum, USC has clinched a share of the Pac-10 title for the first time during the regular season since 2004, but the Trojans are not satisfied with a shared championship.
“We don’t consider it a win,” junior Jaak Poldma said of clinching on Friday. “We still feel we need to win against UCLA.”
A victory against the Bruins would give the Trojans the Pac-10 crown outright, while a loss would give UCLA a share of the title and leave the opportunity for Stanford
USC coach Peter Smith explained that it is crucial to get off to a good start when playing on the road against a team like Arizona.
During doubles play, the Trojans developed the momentum to help them throughout the rest of the match.
The Wildcats put forth a somewhat unorthodox doubles lineup, playing a less talented team at No. 1 in hopes of obtaining an advantage at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots.
No. 8 senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson easily dispatched their opponents 8-2 in the top slot.
At the No. 2 position, sophomore Daniel Nguyen and freshman J.T. Sundling provided the lift that helped propel USC.
Early in the pro set, the Trojan duo was down one break against Geoff Embry and Jason Zafiros.
Nguyen and Sundling then responded with a break of their own to tie the match at 4-4. Then, the duo was able to pull ahead and earn the doubles point with an 8-6 victory.
“Nguyen and Sundling came through at No. 2 doubles,” Smith said. “They were down a break, and you have got to stay up on a team like that. After they won, the whole team started going downhill and really loosened up.”
Juniors Peter Lucassen and Poldma also won with an identical 8-6 score over Andres Carrasco and Jay Goldman.
USC maintained the positive energy during singles play as No. 73 Poldma — playing at No.4 for the first time this season — defeated Zafiros 6-2, 6-3.
Senior Jason McNaughton continued to provide a big lift for the Trojans during conference play with a 6-3, 6-2 victory.
The win improved McNaughton’s record to 5-0 in Pac-10 matches.
No. 15 Farah clinched the match with his defeat of No. 90 Andres Arango 6-2, 7-5.
No. 1 Johnson notched another straight-set victory to extend the Trojans’ lead to 5-0.
No. 83 Nguyen  and No. 104 Lucassen both faced stiff competition but both pulled out three set wins.
“I am so pleased with the team’s discipline,” Smith said. “You have to understand how hard it is to play in Arizona; it’s completely different tennis. The ball flies, and the weather is hot. We took care of business, and that’s the sign of a winner.”
The Trojans may have a share of the Pac-10 title, but with a chance for an outright title and the rival Bruins coming to Marks Stadium on Friday, USC is not finished.
“It’s nice to accomplish things,” Smith said. “We selfishly want more. We will continue to strive for more.”

It sort of just happened.
True freshman early enrollee Dillon Baxter had a great day during Saturday’s scrimmage on Howard Jones Field, and things flowed from there.
First, let’s clarify a bit. Baxter, a running back, had a really great day — so great, he broke a remarkable 50-yard touchdown run and led all backs with 94 yards on just nine carries, and caught another two passes.
Afterward, USC coach Lane Kiffin was asked about Baxter in his post-practice meeting with the media. Kiffin, who’s been nothing if not reserved and cordial since arriving at USC in January, surprisingly didn’t shy away from making quite the bold statement about his new offensive weapon.
“He looked like Reggie versus Fresno,” Kiffin said simply.
Reggie versus Fresno, of course, refers to one of the best Trojan performances in recent history, a 513-yard all-purpose day from former USC running back — and current New Orleans Saint — Reggie Bush in a key November home game against Fresno State in 2005.
Bush also had a remarkable 50-yard touchdown run in that game in which he evaded literally every defender that attempted to tackle him and went completely untouched while traversing the field back and forth.
Kiffin said that Baxter’s run on Saturday — against a defense composed of walk-ons, reserves and a starter or two — compared to it favorably.
“Phenomenal,” Kiffin said of his new offensive weapon. “It didn’t matter who was there. Nobody could tackle him.”
Nobody could tackle Baxter, a San Diego native, in high school either. The MaxPreps National Player of the Year as a quarterback put up ridiculous numbers on his way to becoming a five-star recruit. So far, the 6-foot, 200-pound speedster is calm and poised with the media.
“I don’t have the fastest straight-away speed, but I can make a couple dudes miss,” Baxter told reporters Saturday. “Right now I’m just a pretty shifty back, but I’m going to work on getting bigger and just be a big shifty back.”
When asked about Bush and the pending comparisons between the two backs, Baxter expressed a little bit of wonderment.
“It’s crazy just being compared to Reggie,” Baxter said, who could be third in the line of great USC running backs from the San Diego area after Bush and Marcus Allen before him. “He’s one of the greatest players I’ve ever seen run the ball. I’m excited to show everybody that I can produce the same things that he did.”
Therein lies the rub, though. How do we know that anyone can ever produce the same things that Bush did?
Bush was a one-time thing. One of the reasons departing running back Joe McKnight’s USC career will largely be remembered as unsuccessful was the abnormally high expectations he faced coming in as a freshman and how it was almost impossible for him to match them — no matter what he did. McKnight totaled more than 2,000 rushing yards and more than 500 receiving yards in just three seasons as a Trojan, but people counted on him to be the next Bush — and thus, he was deemed a failure.
And Saturday’s comments from Kiffin have only put similar pressure on Baxter. As a freshman this year, he will struggle to find carries behind the three-headed tandem of seniors Allen Bradford, C.J. Gable and junior Marc Tyler. He will struggle to learn and digest the playbook. He will struggle with the adjustment to balancing academics and athletics, one he has already admitted is taking a lot out of him.
The last thing he needs to struggle with is wondering whether or not he will live up to expectations.
Now, Kiffin might like to have that one back. But that line — that “He looked like Reggie” — will stay with Baxter for the rest of his Trojans career, much like McKnight’s reputation stayed with him throughout his three years with the Trojans.
Only time will tell whom Baxter ends up more like — Bush or McKnight.

yeah that guy is on some other s**t.. he’s built like a rock and has a lot of speed & agility.
i remember when he was thinking of backing out of USC and was looking at a few schools including OU.
then we all woke up and the big 3 all stayed committed to usc.

The last time Reggie Bush suited up for the Trojans was in the 2006 Rose Bowl.
You wouldn’t have known it at Saturday’s practice, which featured the first intrasquad scrimmage of the spring.
Young stunner · Early enrollee freshman running back Dillon Baxter finished his first USC scrimmage with 94 rushing yards on just nine carries, including one rush of 50 yards. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
Freshman running back Dillon Baxter put on his best Bush impression during the scrimmage, dazzling the crowd with ankle-breaking cuts and a pair of long runs. Baxter finished with 94 yards on just nine carries, including a 50-yard touchdown run that left several defenders on their backsides.
“I thought [Baxter] was phenomenal,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “His scoring run looked like Reggie Bush’s against Fresno State in 2005. It didn’t matter who was in front of him, nobody could stop him.”
His teammates were just as impressed by his touchdown run. Baxter emerged from a pile near the right sideline and wove around defenders on his way to the end zone.
“Dillon definitely did some crazy stuff today,” redshirt junior running back Marc Tyler said. “It was fun out there watching him. He did some crazy, stupid stuff today, like a damn videogame.”
Baxter is just one of the running backs looking to work their way into the rotation this spring. Senior Allen Bradford is the leading returning rusher for USC and should be a workhorse for the Trojans. Bradford, who rushed for 668 yards and eight touchdowns last season, carried the ball a team-high 10 times during the scrimmage for 27 yards.
“Whatever coach Kiffin gives me I’m going to take by the reins and do the best I can,” Bradford said.
Part of his responsibilities this season will be mentoring the younger players. Bradford said he has been sharing a simple message with them this spring.
“Go out there and do the little stuff right,” he said. “It’s the little stuff that counts. You can’t look for the big plays every time you get the ball. The big plays are going to come.”
The big plays certainly came on Saturday for Baxter, who had a slow start to spring practice. He ripped off another long run later in the scrimmage that had defenders turned in circles. Now that the freshman — who enrolled in school early so he could take part in spring practice — is getting comfortable, more big plays like the two he had on Saturday could be on the way.
Another running back trying to make an impression on the new coaching staff is Tyler. A top prospect coming out of high school, injuries held Tyler back in his first two seasons. He wants to focus this year on staying healthy.
“The past years I’ve been getting hurt, and that’s really hurt my chances of playing and getting in there,” Tyler said. “If I stay healthy, anything can happen.”
If Tyler can avoid the injuries that have plagued him thus far, he and Bradford should give the Trojans a formidable one-two punch. And if Baxter and speedy sophomore Curtis McNeal can give USC a pair of home run threats the team could have a running attack not unlike the old backfield tandem of Bush and LenDale White.
A number of other USC players turned in standout performances on Saturday. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and senior receiver Ronald Johnson connected for a pair of touchdowns, including a 70-yard strike, and junior defensive tackle Da’John Harris recorded five tackles and returned a stripped ball 52 yards.

When the university announced last Friday that outgoing President Steven B. Sample would be the commencement speaker for the graduating class of 2010, some students were surprised — some even disappointed — that USC didn’t choose a higher-profile speaker to give the class its send-off.
Seniors have no reason to be upset, however. In fact, they have Sample to thank for the prestige of the USC logo on their diplomas.
When Sample accepted the post of university president in 1991, USC was ranked 51 in U.S. News & World Reports and admitted 70 percent of all applicants. Students went home on the weekends, not back to residential halls or dining facilities. Nineteen years later, we are ranked 25th and admit a scant 23.8 percent. No longer a commuter school, USC has a thriving campus and an active student body.
Under Sample’s guidance, USC has routinely recruited students of a higher caliber by providing more merit-based scholarships and financial aid. But he also made a concerted push for well-rounded students with diverse background and interests — an emphasis that shaped not only the university’s academics, but its campus atmosphere. Sample boosted USC’s clout, but he also made it into a dream college.
In the last two decades, USC has been built into the type of university that is able to attract celebrity governors and ’90s sitcom stars as commencement speakers; graduating seniors now have the honor of hearing someone who knows — perhaps better than anyone — the struggle it took to cultivate USC into a top-tier institution.
Those hoping for a flashy address need only to look into USC’s past to realize that many of the university’s most famous commencement speakers have been uninspiring. An accomplished orator, Sample will very likely enter the professional speaking circuit himself after his resignation. Attendees at the May ceremony will have the honor and privilege of hearing an experienced and attuned elocutionist.
The class of 2010 has an enviable speaker: one who is acquainted with the school intimately, one who is eloquent and one who knows, better than anyone else, how difficult it will be to leave this university.
For all of USC’s bragging about becoming a top school, the pride, (and well warranted), the excitement, how it is now more difficult to get into than ever, more applicants than ever, competing with big name schools and now top on lists, etc etc etc..and ‘global’, expanding, more international students, study abroad, etc. etc. etc., the choice of Sample as speaker for commencement is such a contradiction to that, it just seems so ’small town’ and ‘insular’ for where this school is now….yes, he is partly responsible for that, but have a special DAY to honor him, have a special WEEK for him, with tributes in his honor to give HIM the send off HE deserves..but commencement is for THE STUDENTS… no one is saying he has not done an amazing job and just about everyone recognizes that..so honor him at commencement, but not have him as the guest speaker, when most have heard him speak many times over at school through the years. And he is a wonderful speaker.. but this is the students day. If USC is indeed up there with the other famous world renown schools then why not have guest speakers on the level those schools have? Not just some ‘celeb’, but someone OUT THERE in the WORLD, outside of the school, who has accomplished things BEYOND USC, since the hope is that our graduates will have many accomplishments BEYOND USC..I think Sample has done an amazing job. I also think he should recognize this as a once in a lifetime event for the grads, and should have been a big man, and been willing to step aside and give them the send off they deserve. Or all the bragging, all the notices sent to homes and e-mails regarding how great USC has become, pale, if the class graduating, at what seems to be the height of that rise, can’t have a world renown speaker of note on their commencement day, as other top schools have. . It seems that everything at USC has GROWN, except in this area. This area has now, this year, gotten SMALLER…If there was a committee in charge of seeking out and booking a speaker for this special day they should all be replaced, as this was not only a huge oversight, a big mistake of judgment, but seems to be laziness, taking the low road, in the extreme. Or was it University POLITICS, which would be very sad as it is the graduates who suffer …The students have been encouraged to ‘go for it’ to think big, think global, expand themselves in their years at USC, just as the school has done.. and then they get the easiest choice to speak at their graduation…and the grads, who have worked so hard, and have been so committed to, and proud of, the greatness of their school, deserve better on THEIR very special day..not the President’s day, not the Alums day, not the UNIVERSITY POWERS THAT BE day, but THEIR day.  THEIR last day at USC, NOT his, since he will still be around teaching there.
As a graduating senior, I completely expected Sample to be the commencement speaker.  I am also extremely honored that this in fact the case, as I believe no one else has had such an enormous impact on this university in the last two decades.
As a graduate of USC, I cannot remember who our commencement speaker was.  However, if it had been Dr. Steven Sample, I would have never forgotten and would have forever been proud to say he addressed our class.  Sample has turned USC into a top-ranked university which ultimately  makes every diploma  more prestigious and our students more marketable.
We should all be grateful for the time, energy, and commitment he has given to the students and community of USC.

It seems the age of Elle Woods is upon us: Whereas students once writhed and struggled to write 500- to 1,000-word essays summarizing their life goals, they now have the option of creating video essay submissions.
Instead of trying to complete the sentence “I belong at this university because,” students can now consider choreographing dances, arranging dramatic speeches or studying amusing skits when applying to college. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video should be worth exponentially more, right?
While most universities have yet to accept video applications, a few schools, such as Tufts University and Pomona College, are experimenting with the idea. This trend comes at a time when acceptance rates and education budgets are dropping as applicant pools continue to increase.
As competition grows, indicators like grade point average and SAT scores are becoming less reliable at determining one’s chances for acceptance, which now depends more on how much a prospective applicant can grab an admissions officer’s attention.
On one hand, this trend seems horrifying as the college application process begins resembling American Idol. In addition to getting good grades and test scores, the idea that students must train themselves in such personality marketability seems counterintuitive to academia.
Such applicants are often parading themselves like wannabe actors and decorating their personalities with song, dance or quirky declarations affirming their uniqueness, trying to convey a spectacle that would probably never see the light of day in an actual college classroom setting.
If the use of video application processes continues to increase among universities, advice for how to write a college essay may begin sounding like advice for how to become a YouTube star.
In an ABC News interview, Tufts’ Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Lee Coffin said, “We’re not looking for Oscar-winning short films. What we’re really hoping to get out of the videos is another part of the puzzle that makes up this 17-year-old person.”
It sounds ideal that applicants are given more mediums to express themselves, but it raises the question as to whether home video and YouTube culture is conducive to academic goals.
This trend does coincide with the growing importance of one’s familiarity with new media in academics and the job market. Academia already occupies its own sectors of YouTube culture via www.youtube.com/education while job descriptions are adding more onto their list of requirements, stacking on Microsoft Office with Adobe or Aperture and Final Cut, or the ever-vague “social media.”
While YouTube culture has its trivial moments, it has already been integrated and configured into the classroom and workplace, making sense that the college application process follow suit.
Admissions officers have stressed the fact that video essays are neither required nor a replacement for the written essay. It isn’t quite clear yet as to what effect utilizing video applications will have on universities across the world, but the dual-usage capabilities of YouTube for both academic, business and entertainment uses is a crucial factor.
Being able to write a formal essay and use new media like short YouTube videos seem to be key to making it in this economy.
It will be imperative that one skill is not neglected for the other, or else the result could be a whole bunch of YouTube stars that can’t pass their freshman writing class or worse, force the writing standards to be lowered.

I’d like to offer a gentle correction. Pomona College is not “experimenting with this idea” and does not solicit video from students as part of the application. Tufts has a specific set of instructions for the pieces and for submission. Pomona does not and still considers and essay an exercise in writing. 
The only video submissions considered at Pomona are for arts supplements by film makers, actors, dancers and in some sports, athletes whose performances will be evaluated by faculty or coaches and will be considered supplements, not replacements for any other part of the application.
—  Pomona College Admissions
Are they kidding? This is such BS. Writing is already hitting the toilet these days and now prospective students applying to academic institutions get an alternative option?
Knowing how to write well is a skill that is extremely undervalued in America. When one considers the growing importance of international commerce in business and other fields, it’s very important to be able to write cohesively.

Although the idea of consuming animals for gustatory pleasure disgusts many of us, including non-vegetarians, most have grown up eating meat, conditioned to ignore the fact that between those two buns lies a sizzling chunk of cow corpse.
Invasive biomedical animal research, however, is not something we witness or participate in daily, so it’s a lot easier to oppose than carnivorous eating.
But this attitude is illogical. Invasive biomedical animal research has a valuable purpose: the pursuit of knowledge that can be applied to saving lives or lessening the symptoms of disease. Non-vegetarian eating is essential only for the titillation of our taste buds.
Sarah Bottjer, USC professor of biological sciences and psychology, recently published a study in Nature Neuroscience about her discovery of a brain pathway partially responsible for the vocal learning of zebra finches. Her findings might someday help treat stuttering and other speech problems common in autism, Alzheimer’s and other diseases. Unfortunately, the study required surgical lesions to the brains of the little orange-cheeked birds.
The controversy surrounding this type of research is extremely complex. It’s easy to dismiss as immoral, but we need to approach the issue objectively and use our knowledge to make the most ethical decisions on a case-by-case basis.
A number of medical breakthroughs throughout history would have been impossible without invasive animal research. In 1921, scientists discovered insulin could be used to keep people with diabetes alive after performing surgery on dogs and tying up their pancreatic ducts. In 1955, a vaccine against polio was made available after nearly 100,000 Rhesus monkeys were killed in its development.
Unfortunately, birds, rats and mice bred specifically for research are not protected by the Animal Welfare Act, which regulates the conditions under which research animals live and requires scientists to consider alternative ways of obtaining the same information. Despite a variety of lawsuits, the AWA still doesn’t consider these species “animals,” so inspections aren’t conducted and reports aren’t filed.

That really is something to be concerned about. These species make up a majority of the animals mutilated in the name of science, and they are almost always killed after the experiments are over.
A couple of years ago, I met some middle-aged chimpanzees who had just retired from their unpaid jobs as subjects in invasive biomedical research. Although their living conditions had been closely regulated, they were pale, emaciated and traumatized — one female had a bald patch on her stomach because she would pluck her hair out of stress; another obsessively clutched a teddy bear to her chest. At the lab, she was used to breed six baby chimps that had all been taken away from her.
The chimps lived in cramped cages and were repeatedly anesthetized and injected with different vaccines so researchers could evaluate the toxicity in their livers and kidneys.
While writing a story about these chimps for a newspaper, I was introduced to the complexity of this issue. Some experts I interviewed claimed that all of the research is futile and outdated, and the main reason it persists is because it’s a profitable industry that, if abolished, would eliminate thousands of jobs, including those involved in the transportation and the breeding of the animals.
Scientists can study brain function by directly viewing different regions in action and taking photos of injured human brains. Transcranial magnetic stimulation allows doctors to harmlessly study what happens when you increase or decrease the activity in a brain region.
Above all, it’s crucial to consider alternative research methods and use them if they can yield the same information.
Brain imaging, for example, has provided an alternative to dissecting animal brains.
We need to direct more time, money and energy into developing alternative research tools and improving existing technology to lessen the necessity of ethically questionable methods.
We should neither embrace nor dismiss invasive research on animals. We must fully understand its complex aspects so that, using both our hearts and our heads, we can make decisions that advance the interest of our species while respecting the creatures who have already done so much for us.

Just three months after USC imposed sanctions on its basketball program that stemmed from a scandal regarding former player O.J. Mayo and his alleged acceptance of improper gifts and benefits, the school has another potentially damaging issue to deal with. 
The conflict circulates around the potential transfer of Rutgers sophomore guard Mike Rosario. Rosario asked for his release over a week ago and then again on Wednesday. 
If Rosario’s request is granted, Rutgers is expected to prevent him from transferring to USC, where he has some ties. His former high school teammate Jio Fontan transferred to USC from Fordham this past winter. 
The request comes at a time when Rutgers basketball is struggling with issues of its own, primarily with head coach Fred Hill. 
The school has given Hill the offer of taking a buyout worth around $600,000. If he does not accept this deal by Monday, the school will fire him with cause. Charges against Hill include insubordination and failure to discuss important program details with Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti. 
When Rosario asked the school for his release, he was told that he would have to wait until a new head coach was hired.
It is not clear exactly what USC did that would prompt Rutgers to file tampering charges. 
Rosario led Rutgers in scoring the past two seasons. 
If he is released, not only will Rosario be apparently prevented from going to USC, he will also not be able to transfer to Florida or Kansas.
