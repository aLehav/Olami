Sitting down with Jameel Thompkins in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center is like sitting with a celebrity at Disneyland. Within minutes of sitting down, three students came up to Thompkins and greeted him with huge smiles and handshakes.
All smiles · Jameel Thompkins joined Lemonade when it opened. — Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Thompkins, who’s known for his cheerful and friendly demeanor at Lemonade, has been part of the USC culinary staff since August 2010 and has worked at Lemonade since its beginnings on campus.
Thompkins credits his warmth to what he was taught as a child.
“What you put out is what you receive back,” Thompkins said. “Even if I am not having a good day I try to project a good attitude and it helps — it really does.”
Thompkins said that he tries his best to be accommodating for the students, especially when they forget their wallet or ID.
“I sometimes will even dig into my own wallet and pay for them,” Thompkins said.
His cheerfulness, however, is nothing new. Thompkins described himself as a “class clown” when he was young.
“You name [the pranks], and I did them,” Thompkins said. “Everything from prank calling someone’s telephone to the shaving cream in the hand while someone is asleep … I’ve outgrown some of that stuff, but I am still a sucker for a good joke.”
Before working at Lemonade, Thompkins served in the military. Coming from a line of military men, he always felt it was his duty to serve. Fresh out of high school, Thompkins started as a cook on a submarine with a crew of about 130 members.
As a cook in the military, Thompkins prepared meals for the crew members and served as a night baker. After four years at sea, he left with an honorable discharge.
After the military, Thompkins dabbled in different work. He began working in construction but lost his job after the housing market crashed.
“So I came back to what I knew, which was the culinary arts,” Thompkins said.
Now, Thompkins is looking to go back to school to pursue a bachelor’s degree in culinary science. He hopes to open his own restaurant one day.
But for now, students want to keep seeing him around campus. When one of those three students who greeted Thompkins in the Campus Center said goodbye, Thompkins said, “See you later! I’ll take care of you.”
Is this news?  Great you found somebody friendly on campus!
I can attest to Jameel’s amazing attitude and charm. Whenever I go to Lemonade I’m happy to see him. His enthusiasm is infectious.

Conrad Fuentes, a clinical assistant professor in field education at the USC School of Social Work, received the 2012 Outstanding Service and Community Inspiration Award for his commitment to working with gang-involved youth in Orange County.
Outreach · Conrad Fuentes works with Orange County youth. – Courtesy of Conrad Fuentes
The award, presented by the Orange County Department of Education and USC’s field department in Irvine, recognizes Fuentes’ unwavering determination to improve the community. Fuentes received his master’s degree in social work from USC in 2000.
Fuentes said opportunity is the greatest motivator. He has made it his life’s work to ensure that no shortage of the greatest form of motivation meets those who have fallen on hard times.
Fuentes’ mother, who is also a social worker, worked on behalf of immigrant rights. She started the first Spanish-speaking church services in Anaheim, Calif. His inclination toward civic outreach goes deeper than just a desire to foster a safer, more prosperous community. Initially, Fuentes thought he would become a therapist or psychologist.
Fuentes said personal obstacles in his childhood informed his desire to enter in to social work.
“Both my dad and stepdad were gang members,” Fuentes said. “Growing up, there were incidents that were difficult as a child, and I was fortunate enough to make good choices and pursue my education. That’s a privilege that many of my friends did not have access to.”
Fuentes’ first brush with gang intervention came in 1993, when he began working at Orange County Juvenile Hall. There, he began programs to deter substance abuse and counseled teenagers who’d gotten in trouble with the law. Despite the programs and services offered, Fuentes remained concerned over the lack of opportunities available to youths who wanted to turn their lives around.
“I was taken aback by the fact that some simply did not have the opportunity to change,” Fuentes said.
The bleak circumstances, however, did not deter Fuentes. Instead, he viewed the lack of resources available to delinquent teens as an opportunity to improve and restructure the system. Currently, he works for the Lives Worth Saving Gang Intervention program, helping keep violence off the streets and ensuring that gang members have the resources available to make different life decisions.
In addition to working with the outreach program, Fuentes returned to USC as an assistant professor at the USC School of Social Work.
“USC is the pinnacle of social work education,” Fuentes said. “My goal, from the day of graduation [from the School of Social Work] was to eventually come back and teach. I’m glad to carry on the Trojan legacy both out in the world and back at the university.”
Fuentes hopes to continue in collaboration with other civic leaders in solving the gang problem and eventually publish a book on his experience and findings.
“Ultimately, I hope to have a lasting impact and to truly make a difference,” Fuentes said.

The Undergraduate Student Government have posted official endorsements for candidates over the last week, announcing student organizations’ support for tickets, slates and individuals via Facebook and the USG website.
Organizations were required to complete the endorsement form by Feb. 8.
The 2013 elections include two tickets for the positions of president and vice president. Presidential candidate Matthew Arkfeld, the current speaker pro tempore of the senate, and Alex Cascante, a Greek senator, comprise one ticket. Presidential candidate Christian Kurth, the USG director of university affairs, and Ryan Park, a Greek senator, make up the other ticket. Each ticket has secured more than ten endorsements, ranging from Greek organizations to academic groups.
Greek organizations play a large role in each campaign. Five Greek organizations have endorsed Arkfeld and Cascante: fraternities Alpha Epsilon Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Kappa Phi and Sigma Nu.
Kurth and Park have four endorsements from the Greek community: fraternities Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi and Tau Kappa Epsilon.
Several academic organizations endorsed both tickets. Arkfeld and Cascante received 17 endorsements from student organizations, which include USC College Republicans, the Korean Student Association, Marshall Outreach and Volunteer Entrepreneurs, Spanish Undergraduate Student Association, Trojan Alliance, Volunteers Around the World and USC’s women’s basketball team.
Kurth and Park were endorsed by 11 organizations, including the Construction Management Association of America, Fluor Tower Residential College, Society 53, Student Alumni Society,  Trojan Knights, the USC Admissions Center and the USC Pre-Law Society.
Unofficially, Kurth and Park’s campaign has also utilized Facebook to share photos of well-known students, such as T.J. McDonald and Marqise Lee, holding campaign memorabilia. Robert Woods sent a supportive tweet to the campaign as well.
Voting began Tuesday at midnight and will last until Thursday at 8 p.m. Voting can be accessed online at elections.usc.edu by using a USC email login information. Online voters can select their presidential, vice presidential and senatorial candidates. The winners will be announced Feb. 19.

Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson will resign June 30, President C. L. Max Nikias announced Monday in a letter addressed to the USC community.
Legendary leader · Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson announced Monday that he will resign after 18 years at USC. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The provost’s office will conduct a national search to fill the position of vice president for student affairs soon, according to the letter. Jackson will take a one-year sabbatical from USC and return as emeritus vice president and executive director of International Advancement. He will also continue to teach in the Rossier School of Education.
“For 18 years, Dr. Jackson has served in this key leadership role with tremendous distinction, assisting the university in its efforts to become a top destination for students around the world, as well as a fully residential university,” Nikias said in the letter. “Dr. Jackson has touched countless students with his vision and compassion, and I know the entire USC community joins me in commending his outstanding service.”
Jackson oversaw key changes to the university, including the expansion of several Programs in Student Affairs, such as the Career Center and Orientation programs, as well as the construction of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Residential College at Parkside and the Arts and Humanities Residential College. His department also added the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Center, the Office of Veterans and Transfer and the Office of Parent Programs. As vice president for student affairs, Jackson’s department oversees the Office of Student Publications, which includes the Daily Trojan.
At a “What Matters to Me and Why” event last year, Jackson said he believes part of God’s plan is that love gets actualized when communities care for one another.
“How I go about spreading this love is the work I do in this role as a vice president for student affairs at USC,” Jackson said. “I work with the goal of providing environments that allow others to thrive and fulfill their dreams and their hopes so they can go out and spread peace and love.”
Many student organizations have felt the impact of Jackson’s influence.
“He’s been inspirational and a visionary for the university,” said Graduate Student Government President Yael Adef. “It’s going to be a tremendous loss to the student body.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos said Jackson’s achievements at USC speak for themselves.
“It caught me by surprise because he’s been such a staple at this university for such a while,” Geragos said. “It’s sad for me to see him go … and [these accomplishments] really show his dedication to the university.”
Nikias wrote that Jackson’s contributions have shaped the direction of the university for years to come.
“As we acknowledge Dr. Jackson’s stellar service to USC, we wish him continued success in the next phase of his career,” Nikias said in his statement. “His contributions to this university are both extensive and exceptional, and for this, we are all truly grateful.”

Riding high after three straight victories, the USC men’s basketball team had to deal with some bad news Monday when it was announced that redshirt junior forward Ari Stewart will be out of action for at least three weeks after he suffered a fractured left thumb in Sunday’s 71-60 win over Washington at the Galen Center.
Tough break · Redshirt junior forward Ari Stewart had finally found a spot in interim head coach Bob Cantu’s rotation when he broke his thumb. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
In his first season of eligibility after transferring to USC from Wake Forest, Stewart has had an up-and-down season with the Trojans. Under former USC coach Kevin O’Neill, Stewart received sporadic playing time and struggled to find a niche in the rotation. In 17 games with O’Neill at the helm, Stewart only appeared in nine of them. Of those nine games, he played fewer than 10 minutes in five games and averaged 2.9 points per game on 33 percent shooting, including a 28.6 percent mark from 3-point range.
Stewart has experienced a resurgence of sorts under interim head coach Bob Cantu. In the seven games since Cantu’s takeover of the team, Stewart has appeared in each game and averaged 13.3 minutes per contest as one of the team’s primary bench players. With the added minutes, Stewart saw his scoring average jump to 4.4 points per game under Cantu. In addition, Stewart has become a more effective rebounder, averaging three rebounds per game under Cantu compared to just 1.1 per game under O’Neill.
With Stewart’s absence, players such as senior forwards Aaron Fuller and Renaldo Woolridge can expect an increase in minutes. Despite receiving limited playing time, Fuller has been hot as of late. He has shot a staggering 91.7 percent from the field on 12 shots over the past three games, including a near-perfect 15-point effort in the team’s 75-71 overtime win over UCLA.
Woolridge, on the other hand, has appeared in just 14 games this season and averaged only 4.5 minutes per game played. A Southern California native, whose father Orlando Woolridge played 13 seasons in the NBA including two with the Los Angeles Lakers, the younger Woolridge offers a versatile skill set. At six-foot-nine, he shot 37.2 percent from 3-point land last season at Tennessee. Though he has yet to display that kind of shooting stroke this season while posting a 25 percent mark from long distance.
If his recovery follows the expected timetable, Stewart will be able to rejoin the team on the court in time to compete in the 2013 Pac-12 tournament, which begins on March 13 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.
USC next plays Thursday against Stanford in a nationally televised game at 8:00 p.m. in Palo Alto, Calif.

The USC baseball program had its annual alumni game on Sunday, with a host of recent and not-so-recent ex-players taking on this year’s squad. Several members of the 1963 national championship team were there celebrating their 50th anniversary and the 2013 Trojans had a chance to play a few live innings in preparation for their season, which starts on Friday.
But there was one very noticeable absence from Sunday’s festivities. No, it wasn’t a big-name alum like Mark Prior, Randy Johnson or Mark McGwire. It fact, it wasn’t even an alum at all: It was USC coach Frank Cruz.
Cruz was suspended late Thursday night by the university pending an investigation into NCAA Countable Athletically Related Activities rule violations.
The amount of hours athletes can spend practicing directly with members of the coaching staff is limited to 20 hours per week during the season and eight hours per week out of season. CARAs range from full-fledged practices to things seemingly mundane such as film review or even just playing catch with a coach.
“We take any potential NCAA infraction seriously,” Athletic Director Pat Haden said in a statement. “USC Vice President for Athletic Compliance Dave Roberts and his staff will investigate whether the baseball program exceeded the allowable CARA hours, and will do so diligently and expeditiously. Pending the results of the investigation, we have suspended Coach Cruz from all coaching duties.”
Team members said Haden broke the news to them in the clubhouse following last Thursday’s practice.
“It was really just shocking,” said junior catcher Jake Hernandez. “Obviously not at all news you would expect.”
To have your coach suspended just one week before the start of the season is jarring, to say the least, but members of the team recognize that they have to stay focused on what they need to do on the field.
“We’ve just gotta go play baseball,” Hernandez said. “Whatever else is happening, we’re just sticking together as a team and focusing on the game.”
Associate head coach Dan Hubbs is leading the team in the interim while the USC Compliance Department and Associate Athletic Director Mark Jackson conduct their own internal investigation and try to get ahead of the issue before the NCAA gets involved.
“Coach Cruz and coach Hubbs have both done a great job of co-leading the team ever since Hubbs got here,” Hernandez said. “So the uncertainty is a little rough, sure, but we’re used to hearing from coach Hubbs anyway.”
Several upperclassmen, such as Hernandez and senior infielder Adam Landecker, have taken a more vocal role in keeping the team focused amid this very large distraction.
“Just reminding everyone that we’re still a team,” said Landecker. “We’ve still gotta be ready to play a game [on Friday] no matter what.”
USC opens the season this Friday at Cal State Fullerton, then visits Cal State Bakersfield on Saturday before the team’s home opener at Dedeaux Field on Sunday at 1 p.m. against Nebraska.
Might as well give Hubbs a chance to be head coach, and see if there is a major improvement from last two
years. Time to make a real search for a new leader if this season fizzles out. The program has become a major
source of futility for several years since Gillespie was fired after the great tradition set by Rod Dedeaux.

Lindsey Munday made her point clear Saturday afternoon.
She was concise.
During a two-minute video played during halftime of USC’s inaugural women’s lacrosse game at the historic Coliseum, the Women of Troy’s first-year coach appeared on the video board on the west end of the stadium and stated plainly toward the end of the clip: “Our goal is to win a national championship.”
Eyes on the prize · USC head coach Lindsey Munday has offered no excuses and has the women’s lacrosse team aiming high in its first season. — William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Not bad, huh? She didn’t, in the recorded video, exactly shy away from the declaration. No apologies. No nonsense. Her remark was refreshing. It was honest. It was simple.
Look, the excuses for Munday and her new program are built in. They’re easy to spot, and you would have a tough time faulting her for citing any of them. One, the women’s lacrosse program is playing its first season as a varsity sport at USC. Two, her team is incredibly young: Of the 26 players on the roster, 17 are freshmen and seven are sophomores. There are no seniors and just two are juniors. And to fill those spots — to build her team — she gets to use just 12 scholarships. It isn’t like football recruiting. You don’t get to offer everyone full rides.
She didn’t mention any of those things following Saturday’s opener.
Munday, 28, is keeping with her basic approach. For the program’s first game, she scheduled No. 1 Northwestern University, where she played from 2003-06 and served as an assistant from 2007-10, and then No. 6 Massachusetts on Sunday. Mind you, the Wildcats have won seven NCAA championships in the last eight seasons.
“They’re the top in women’s lacrosse right now, and to be able to show our girls where that is and to show them at times we can compete with [Northwestern] gives them confidence we can get there,” Munday said.
“There” is the pinnacle of the sport. Of course, USC still has a ways to go. Against Northwestern, the Women of Troy fell by a final score of 18-5 in front of a crowd of 2,890. They trailed the entire game and were down 11-2 by halftime. A day later, they led Massachusetts 6-4 early, but again fell, 18-9. They’re now 0-2.
But give Munday and her upstart program credit: They’re gunning for No. 1. They’re looking to make a splash. They sure aren’t sucking their thumbs, if you will. They want to win the NCAA championship.
“It’s something that is there for us and we’re not scared to go out and say it,” Munday said.
For whatever reason, USC, as a whole, has gone soft in the last couple years. The excuses have consistently trickled out of Heritage Hall. For football, it’s been the postseason ban and scholarship reductions, the “10 fewer guys,” as USC head coach Lane Kiffin so often puts it. For men’s basketball, it too was scholarship reductions and injuries, former coach Kevin O’Neill was quick to point out. For baseball, it’s been the school’s status as a private school, seemingly a limitation when it comes to recruiting and signing high school athletes.
Not that these circumstances aren’t valid, but the frequency gives off a sort of “woe is me” sound bite. And, really, for USC, with its 96 NCAA championships and all the tradition, isn’t that kind of talk beneath the school’s athletic programs?
Which is why listening to Munday on Saturday was so refreshing. She talked about the process, about learning from the matchup against Northwestern, about improving each week, about doing well in conference play (the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) and about winning NCAA titles, at least eventually. There wasn’t a litany of excuses offered. She kept it simple. She kept it direct. After all, she’s won before under Kelly Hiller at Northwestern.
And the hope stands that that success can translate to USC. Her mentor, at least, appeared optimistic.
“I have a lot of respect for Lindsey,” said Hiller, who took over the Wildcats’ program in 2002. “She’s an amazing role model for her student athletes and a good friend.”
Munday hopes to follow that success of winning and winning championships. She brought it up in the first team meeting in the fall.
“In general, when you set goals, it’s important to reach for the stars,” Munday said. “To put out there what you want, so you know it’s there and not this vague idea of success or what you want to be — We know that’s it for us.”
Well put. That’s the end game.

Munday exemplifies the ideology behind the mantra, “Fight On!” What an outstanding addition to USC.

The USC women’s tennis team’s quest for an ITA National Indoor championship was thwarted Saturday when No. 8 North Carolina edged out the Women of Troy by a score of 4-3 in the quarterfinals.
So close · USC sophomore Zoë Scandalis fell to UNC’s Whitney Kay in a hard-fought quarterfinals match at the ITA National Indoors. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
North Carolina (8-0) exacted revenge against a USC squad that upset the Tar Heels last year in the quarterfinal round of this tournament.
Before advancing to the quarterfinals, however, USC was able to notch a victory over Virginia in the Round of 16.
In that match, USC dropped its first doubles point of the season against the Cavaliers, despite the tandem of junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria taking home an 8-0 win against Virginia’s No. 10 pair of Stephanie Nauta and Li Xi.
Even though they lost the doubles point, the Women of Troy rallied behind the strong play at the top of the singles round to steal a win against Virginia. After senior Danielle Lao and Santamaria won their matches on courts one and two, respectively, sophomore Giuliana Olmos would put USC one win away from securing a 4-3 victory.
Fighting back after a 6-1 loss in the first set, sophomore Gabriella DeSimone won the last two sets 7-5, 7-6, as she finished off Maci Epstein in a final set tiebreaker to seal the deal.
“We knew it was going to be a very difficult match because they are very good, and they are on their home courts, so it was an excellent win for us,” USC head coach Richard Gallien said. “Virginia is really good and they are very talented, so I’m really proud of our girls to step up to the challenge today. It’s so early in the year and we haven’t been tested much yet, so to win a match like this is extra special.”
In the quarterfinals against North Carolina, USC started out taking the doubles point behind two dominating performances on courts one and three. The nation’s top-ranked pair of Christian and Santamaria was able to defeat the No. 7-ranked UNC duo of Ashley Dai and Whitney Kay 8-3 for their 17th-straight victory.
Court three saw Lao pair with Olmos to take down Tessa Lyons and Lauren McHale by an 8-3 margin to wrap up the doubles point.
Despite a 1-0 lead, the singles portion of the match proved to be a daunting task for the Women of Troy.
Santamaria took care of business on court one with a 6-3, 6-2 win against No. 11 Gina Suarez-Malguti; meanwhile, Lao defeated No. 28 Zoe De Bruycker by the same margin in the second slot.
These two victories would be the only two singles wins that USC would muster, as the team wound up dropping their next four matches.
Olmos faced a tough task trying to take down No. 36 Caroline Price on court five and she wasn’t able to pull through, losing 6-2, 6-2.
Needing to win one more singles match, the onus was on DeSimone and Christian to deliver.  Unfortunately for USC, DeSimone failed to break through in the fourth slot and Christian also fell short on court five.
Finally, Kay defeated freshman Zoë Scandalis in three sets (6-2, 5-7, 6-3) to clinch the North Carolina victory and send the Women of Troy packing.
“With UNC winning it and UCLA playing them [in the finals], we know where the bar is set,” assistant coach West Nutt said. “It gives us belief that we’re on track.”
Following the devastating loss, USC played No. 7 Cal in a consolation match on Sunday. Sticking with the theme of the weekend, the Women of Troy were led by Santamaria and Lao in singles matches and wound up defeating the Golden Bears 4-1. Both Lao and Santamaria, who rank No. 14 and 17 in the country, respectively, took down opponents who were ranked higher in the polls.
Lao won a tight first set before she would put away No. 7 Zsofi Susanyi, and Santamaria handily defeated No. 8 Anett Schutting in their match by a 6-4, 6-3 margin.
In doubles play, Santamaria and Christian ran their unbeaten streak to 18 games with an 8-6 win over Cal’s Tayler Davis and Susanyi as USC shook off its first loss of the season with a complete game against a rival opponent.
“The game was really tough for both us and Cal,” Nutt said. “But it was good to get out there and get a victory against arguably a top-five team.”
After playing three matches in as many days, USC will have an extended break before returning to action on Feb. 20 to take on San Diego State at Marks Stadium at 1:30 p.m.
When will Coach Gallien really do something big with talent on his side.? Peter Smith wins 4 National Titles
in a row while Richard Gallien finds a way to come up short year after year. Since USC has become a tennis
school along with water polo these days time for him to make a statement on the court.

The USC men’s basketball team closed out a 71-60 victory over the Washington Huskies at the Galen Center on Sunday night to the exuberant chants of a crowd belting “We Are SC” in unison.
Locked in · Senior forward Eric Wise poured in 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds in Sunday’s 71-60 win over Washington. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans (11-13, 6-5 Pac-12) pumped up fans with a dominating performance in which they never surrendered the lead and featured multiple dunks and 3-pointers. To top things off, the team turned in a near-perfect showing at the free throw line, shooting a stellar 14-15 from the charity stripe.
This marks the third straight win for USC, a feat last accomplished in February 2011.
“Tonight everybody came out with a tremendous amount of intensity, a lot of energy, and I think it showed,” junior guard J.T. Terrell said. “I think we were just ready to get a win.”
Coming into Sunday night’s game, the Trojans and the Huskies (13-11, 5-6 Pac-12) had matching 5-5 records in conference play. USC was fueled by consecutive victories over crosstown rival UCLA and a comeback against Washington State on Thursday, while Washington has gone 1-6 after winning its first four conference games.
“[The Huskies] are a very good team. It was just our night, and we were making shots,” USC interim head coach Bob Cantu said. “This is definitely a very impressive win for our guys.”
USC now leads the formerly tied all-time series against Washington with 69 wins and 68 losses. The Trojans lost their two previous games against Washington by an average of 25 points, but that was far from the case on Sunday night.
The team started off explosively, netting seven of its first nine attempts to take an early 18-6 lead, eventually leading by as many as 19 points in the first half. The offensive display was supported by several stellar performances, including one from Terrell, who led the team with 18 points, including four 3-pointers. Senior forward Eric Wise tallied 12 points, and the bench contributed 19.
In addition to an impressive 53.3 shooting percentage, the Trojans’ defense stymied the Huskies in large part by limiting Washington’s top scorer, guard C.J. Wilcox, who entered the game averaging 18.1 points per contest but only notched eight against USC.
Still, Washington guard Scott Suggs helped the Huskies chisel away at the Trojan lead by scoring 16 points in the second half, allowing the team to pull within six points of the lead. But ultimately, the Trojans held on to top the Huskies by 11.
“Right now we’re really just playing with no leash, no limits,” Terrell said. “We’re holding ourselves accountable more and holding each other accountable.”
The team as a whole went 14-for-15 from the free-throw line, with senior point guard Jio Fontan breaking the perfect percentage with an in-and-out miss with 35.8 seconds remaining in the game. In the three-game winning streak, the team has sunk 41 of 49.
By comparison, the Huskies made 4 of 14 from the line and just 1 of 6 in the second half Sunday night.
“Guys are playing with confidence and they’re feeling good and stepping up to the line and making [free throws] when they count,” Cantu said. “That was a huge advantage for us.”
USC also showed a lot of versatility on the court with bench players stepping up in clutch situations. Fontan found himself in foul trouble early on in the second half, prompting Cantu to send in freshman point guard Chass Bryan. Bryan sunk a pair of 3-pointers down the stretch, and also had two assists and a steal.
“Those minutes that Chass gave us were so big and so important,” Cantu said. “He handled their pressure. He didn’t turn it over and he made shots.”
The crowd at the Galen Center responded to the team’s energy, rising to its feet several times within the final minutes, first to cheer a then-perfect free throw percentage and then to usher in a third-consecutive win. For a team that hasn’t seen too many of them, the standing ovation was a rewarding sight.
“It just brings a lot of energy to the arena itself and our sense of hope as a team,” Terrell said. “To have your fans in it is a big difference when it’s a close, tight game at the end.”
The Trojans travel next to Northern California to face Stanford and Cal, two other teams in a four-way tie for fifth in the Pac-12.
“When this whole transition happened four weeks ago, we didn’t know what to expect. We just took it day by day and we still are,” Cantu said. “We’re just fortunate right now to get three [wins] in a row, we’ve got some momentum and now we’re on the road which is going to be more difficult, but we’re going to regroup and be ready to go.”

If you haven’t heard of Ra Ra Riot yet, that’s about to change. And not just because of this article — the release of its third studio album, Beta Love, has given the band a building wave of popularity in the music community. Both the electronic and indie music genres have slowly gained mainstream appreciation in the past few years; by fusing both genres with soft vocals, the group of four has created a perfectly catchy and eclectic album.
Out of this world · Guitarist Milo Bonacci, violinist Rebecca Zeller, bassist Mathieu Santos and vocalist Wesley Miles (left to right) make up the band Ra Ra Riot. On its latest album, Beta Love, the band experiments with a new sound and creates a record that is both futuristic and ethereal. – Courtesy of Sacks & Co.
Bands often change their sounds every few years in order to keep their fanbases on their toes, and that is certainly a move Beta Love represents. A break from Ra Ra Riot’s previous work, the new album utilizes synthesizers to create new timbres in the background of several tracks. The resulting songs are soft and bouncy, and are unexpectedly easy listens for the electronic-indie genre.
Lyrically and musically, this album also takes many chances by exploring unusual themes — critics have described it as highly futuristic, orchestral, experimental and almost ethereal. The choice to include more electronic elements in the album was largely a personal one, as the band members themselves enjoy electronic music and wanted to express that in their own work.
The band’s innovative combination of keyboards with classic rock strums — reminiscent of the ’70s and ’80s — have made the album definitively upbeat, with a few slower, romantic tunes like “Wilderness” and “Is It Too Much” mixed in. The arrangement of the tracks makes a one-time, chronological listen easy and almost instinctual.
The increased flexibility in terms of the content and structure of its songs is in part because of the crossroads the band faced with the departure of its cellist, Alexandra Lawn. Bassist Mathieu Santos said the band used the release of this record to experiment with the ways it approached each individual track. Though usually every band member contributes their respective instruments to each song, in this album Ra Ra Riot considered the instrumentation of each song on an individual basis.
“Instead of piling on the instruments on top of every [song], we wanted to make sure we were really doing what was right for the individual songs,” Santos said. “[Doing so] forced people to [go] outside their comfort zones. It was a good exercise in restraint, and trying to serve the songs first.”
In the same way that Ra Ra Riot incorporated more of the sounds it liked, members also added their personal interests to the lyrics of the album, drawing inspiration from science fiction and non-fiction literature.
“This time around, it’s been like, ‘You know what? These ideas are really interesting to us now, and we’re thinking about them all the time, so let’s write songs about them,” Santos said.
Having spent months in preparation and rehearsals for tour, learning how to perform its new songs with the new instruments, the band was anxious for the Jan. 22 release of Beta Love. It released partway through the band’s world tour, a few weeks before a trip to Asia and an impending stop in Los Angeles on Feb. 12 at the El Rey Theatre.
Despite the inevitable discomfort of older fans with the changes, the album has been receiving generally enthusiastic positive feedback.
“We’ve been excited for this record to come out for a lot of reasons, but one of the biggest ones is so that we can finally have new music to play live,” Santos said. “Playing the old and new songs side by side makes the old ones more interesting by having the new ones to compare them to.”
The new sound that Ra Ra Riot has created represents, in Santos’ own words, “pop music that can connect to people in different ways and has this cool unifying thing that all different people can get into.” And, despite having not planned on sticking together past college, the band members have found themselves working with Elvis Costello’s producer, nominated for the Independent Music Awards and even featured in car commercials.
“We’re still having fun, and we said we’ll keep doing it as long as we’re having fun,” Santos said. “Now we’re just trying to see how far we can take it. I guess the timing worked out pretty nicely.”

“Please be sure that buttocks and female breasts are adequately covered. Thong type costumes are problematic. Please avoid exposing bare fleshy under curves of the buttocks and buttock crack. Bare sides or under curvature of the breasts is also problematic. Please avoid sheer see-through clothing that could possibly expose female breast nipples. Please be sure the genital region is adequately covered so that there is no visible ‘puffy’ bare skin exposure.”
And so read the memo sent by CBS executives to all performers and attendees of the 2013 Grammys that aired live Sunday. Over the years, the Grammys, known as the biggest night in music, has been a highlight in the awards season. Instead of stuffy interviews and classy designer gowns, pop stars, EDM DJs, rock singers and more decide to be just as outrageous as their music through their fashion.
After all, who can forget J. Lo’s epic Versace gown from 2000? All navel and barely fabric. Or what about Lady Gaga’s red carpet arrival in an egg? Yes, an egg, carried by several people.
The Grammys is not a night to be subtle. Musicians are some of the most eccentric, creative people on the planet and a night when they’re celebrated is a night for them to party. We can’t expect them to be anything other than their outrageous selves.
So the fact that some executives at CBS thought it would be a great idea to do send out this memo in the first place is laughable. Literally, laughable. I couldn’t help but burst into laughter picturing a bunch of old men in suits writing the words, “Please be sure the genital region is adequately covered so that there is no visible ‘puffy’ bare skin exposure.”
Network censorship has always been an issue — since the advent of television. Hence, Lucy and Ricardo sleeping in separate beds, the lack of homosexual storylines on scripted shows well into the ’90s and family-friendly, all-wrapped-up-in-a-bow endings on episodic shows.
But now it’s 2013 and we can’t keep trying to censor people for simply being themselves. Organizations like the Parents Television Council can write their letters saying that gay kissing is corrupting our youth, but it’s not going to do anything. And one can write a letter telling people not to wear sheer dresses and it might work, but chances are people are just going to find a way around it.
Which they did. The 2013 Grammys were full of sheer gowns, and so-called “bare sides or under curvature of the breasts.” A simple memo didn’t do much to silence the crowd. These are the Grammys — if you want a wholesome show, turn to ABC Family. When you invite artists like Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Drake, Kimbra and more, expect a little craziness. Rihanna arrived in a beautiful sheer scarlet gown with criss-cross panels across her chest. At least her nipples were covered, right?
Red carpet queen of the Grammys Jennifer Lopez arrived in a one-shouldered black gown with her entire right leg sticking out up to her hip: When you can’t show what’s up top, show what’s down. Meanwhile, Perry’s green dress was supposed to be an ode to 1970’s Priscilla Presley but wound up looking more like an ode to her breasts.
Yes, certain things should be off-limits. Of course, no nudity should be allowed on network TV before a certain time in case some kid accidently stumbles upon it while flipping through channels. But while J. Lo’s dress wasn’t exactly the most demure frock, it was her choice to wear it. All of the necessary bits were covered so offended onlookers don’t have much to go on. It’s your choice to think that another person’s outfit is skanky or ugly or beautiful, but you can’t force them not to wear it because you don’t like it. I loved Rihanna’s gown; I thought it was sexy and classy, but I thought that Perry’s was on a train to tacky town.
Making music is an expression of an artist. And in today’s day and age, an artist’s style is part of the package. Style, in general, is a physical representation of the person underneath those clothes. Telling me that I can’t wear a certain something only stifles my creativity and forces me to wear something that is more part of the “system.”
Hopefully, executives begin to realize the ridiculousness of their wants and begin to understand that you can’t cage a person. We’re lucky enough to live in a country that prides itself on democracy and freedom, and if a pop star or two wants to show off their freedom to wear weird outfits, why not?

In a city that becomes awash in a flurry of scarves and pea coats at the first sight of 60-degree weather, a hot bowl of traditional Japanese ramen can serve as a culinary refuge for many during Los Angeles’ infamously “harsh” winters. However, tsukemen, which is ramen suited for warmer weather, challenges Southern Californian notions of what the noodle dish ought to be.
Good eats · At Ikemen, each ingredient is carefully selected. The sauce added to Red Dragon gives the soft doughy octopus takoyaki a nice heat. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
Though traditional ramen combines a savory broth with noodles to create a rich, hot dish, tsukemen, or “dip ramen,” separates the two elements and cools them down.
When Ikemen first opened its doors in Hollywood in 2011, the reaction to its tsukemen, or “dip ramen,” was hit-or-miss with Californians in the throes of a ramen revolution. But, now that ramen has transcended trendiness to flesh out its own niche in Los Angeles’ dining scene, revisiting ramen’s more chilled-out cousin seems warranted. The recent opening of another branch of Ikemen at the Weller Court in Little Tokyo gives us a closer look into what might quickly become one of Los Angeles’ late-night culinary traditions.
The recipes and menu at Ikemen are the brainchild of famed Japanese chef Shigetoshi “Sean” Nakamura. Japan, a country which has no qualms about defying its culinary figureheads, identifies Nakamura as one of the Four Ramen Devas, or one of Japan’s four gods of ramen. These select chefs enjoy national prominence on account of their perceived mastery of the preparation of ramen in their respective regions.
Nakamura’s culinary genius is aptly substantiated through Ikemen’s ambitions, and Ikemen’s menu reads like a creative exercise on the Japanese-born flavor phenomenon of umami (Umami is best described as a deep, savory taste which also doubles as the Japanese word for “delicious”).
One of the most interesting ways Nakamura introduces the element of umami to his menu includes the katsuobushi, or dried bonito flakes. Though high quality pre-shaved katsuobushi can be found packaged at Japanese markets, Nakamura takes things a step further: Ikemen imports their dried bonito in the form of whole dried fish flown directly from Japan. The fish, which have been smoked and dried repeatedly over the course of up to two weeks, come to resemble hunks of charred oak wood. Right before serving, these hunks are put into on-site shaving machines designed specifically for creating parchment-thin swatches of gorgeously striated katsuobushi.
The katsuobushi makes its most welcome appearance in the Ikemen Dip ramen, where the thin slivers melt into the porky broth (dubbed Tonkotsu Au Jus) and lend it a positively surreal amount of umami. The thick noodles used to soak up the broth are no afterthought, either: Wavy, pale-gold and perfectly al dente, the noodles are practically bespoke for dipping and in an altogether different league from the likes of Daikokuya or Shin-Sen-Gumi.
Ikemen attempts to tackle umami from a different angle in the Ghost Buster Dip. Here, the aforementioned Tonkotsu Au Jus is treated with cream, truffle oil and sauteed mushrooms. The finishing touch is a marshmallow, which is set ablaze tableside by a waiter wielding a handheld blowtorch. The hapless marshmallow is then dunked in the broth to meld with the surrounding flavors, which it does marvelously.
A sampling of the broth reveals a procession of flavors beginning with the porky au jus, followed by the earthy umami of the truffle oil and mushrooms, rounded out with the slight sweetness of caramelized marshmallow. The finish melds all of the flavors and lingers pleasantly, familiarizing what is an eclectic, yet oddly comforting, dish.
Ikemen falters in one area of admittedly limited importance: the chashu, or pork, is prepared in the kitchen by applying heat from a handheld blowtorch. Though the preparation does allow for a fully cooked product with a cool temperature suitable for summertime tsukemen, the flavor of the pork itself is a little underwhelming and compares unfavorably to the pork offered at Santouka or Ramen Yamadaya.
Much like the menu’s emphasis on a departure from traditional ramen shop offerings, the storefront and waitstaff at Ikemen’s Little Tokyo location are  a change from the staunch traditionalism and outwardly Japanese design elements often typified in the decor of authenticity-obsessed Southern California ramen restaurants.
Instead, the Little Tokyo location playfully juxtaposes sleek, minimalist black countertops with comically ornate tall-backed wooden thrones. The piano solo from Horace Silver’s “Song for My Father” clangs through the restaurant’s speaker system, and the staff are dressed with a matching ivory-tickling whimsy: Everyone from the kitchen to the front is outfitted in neckties and fedoras to augment the overall slick-yet-playful aesthetic of the location.
Those accustomed to traditional hot ramen will certainly enjoy Ikemen’s Premium Ramen, but to do so would be to miss the point of the restaurant, at least partially. Ikemen’s Little Tokyo specifically highlights their tsukemen and breaks from preconceived notions of Japanese ramen in every sense. It’s unfortunate that Ikemen’s opening coincided with winter in Southern California, as its tsukemen is best suited for the warmer weather the city enjoys for eight months out of the year. Ikemen’s strong execution in the kitchen and ambitious flavor profiles, however, are sure to win over followers regardless of the season.
 
Ikemen’s Little Tokyo location is located inside the Weller Court Shopping Center on the south corner of 1st and Los Angeles streets, adjacent to the Marukai Market. Cash only.

Not every musical has a happy-go-lucky feel to it. Jekyll and Hyde, running at the Pantages Theatre until March 3, is one such play.
It’s complicated · Emma Carew (Teal Wicks) embraces Henry Jekyll (Constantine Maroulis). Carew, the love interest of Dr. Jekyll, eventually becomes the hostage of Jekyll’s split personality, the evil Mr. Hyde. – Courtesy of Sacks & Co.
American Idol star and Tony Award nominee Constantine Maroulis plays the lead double role, with Teal Wicks playing Emma Carew, the love interest of Dr. Jekyll and the eventual hostage of Mr. Hyde.
Wicks is no novice to the stage or to the Pantages. During the Pantages’ 2007-09 run of Wicked, she became the understudy for the lead role, Elphaba. In May 2008, she took over the role in Los Angeles, and then reprised the role in the San Francisco production until February 2010. With such a high-profile show on her resume, Wicks is ready for new challenges and characters.
“With Wicked, I came into it after it had been running for a while so you’re slightly limited in what you’re able to create with the character within the framework of the show,” she said. “With Jekyll and Hyde I get to start with a clean slate and work [Emma] from the ground up.”
Emma is absolutely a test of Wicks’ acting chops, since the character is new to the musical. In the original 1886 novella by Robert Louis Stevenson, there is no love interest to further complicate the Jekyll/Hyde split-personality story, adding an element to the musical that audiences haven’t experienced in the text.
The musical interpretation of this century-old story also allows audiences to take in the transformation of the lead character before their very eyes, with musical cues for what to expect from lead actor Maroulis. Wicks is just glad that she only has one role in the show.
“It’s a huge undertaking as an actor — I mean, each role is such a challenge, to do both of them and make each character different,” she said, referring to the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde role. “I have to applaud Constantine [Maroulis] with what he’s doing because it’s tough. For me, I get to sit back and watch!”
The show, with a split personality as the main plot point, inherently has a high contrast of light and dark themes, but Emma acts as an anchor for Dr. Jekyll, constantly reinforcing his humanity. Wicks boasts about Emma’s strengths as a character, saying that audiences will find her relatable and likable.
“What I like about [Emma] is that she sticks to what she believes in, what she thinks is right. She’s very passionate,” she said. “Within this story, she stays with Dr. Jekyll even though there’s all this crazy stuff going on, and a lot of people are questioning if she’s making the right decision. She fully believes that she is and sticks to her guns for the whole course of the show.”
The darkness of the show — from murder to mad scientists — doesn’t bother Wicks at all. In fact, that’s what she especially likes about it. By its very definition, a musical is supposed to use the emotion of the lyrics and score to develop the characters, but with Jekyll and Hyde, she said the soundtrack especially serves to complement the storyline.
“What’s so cool about this show is the music really embraces it,” she said. “There’s a distinct difference between the rock-driven songs that go along with Hyde and then there’s the lyrical music that goes along with other characters like Emma. The music of the show really embraces the contrast between the light and the dark, which is the whole theme of the show.”
As the show goes on tour, there’s a risk that audiences across the country will react differently to its dark tone, but Wicks has been pleasantly surprised to discover  audience’s understanding and appreciation of the show, despite some of its more sinister moments.
“Across the board, the audiences have really embraced it and been supportive for the show, but it’s a little different in each town,” she said. “[The play] is really dark, it has an edge to it, so some people are kind of freaked out by it. The murder in it, there’s death.”
The tone of the play may be dark, but with such a classic story, audiences will be able to immerse themselves in this new interpretation. Has there ever been a Broadway show quite like Jekyll and Hyde? Wicks isn’t even sure it fits into any one genre.
“It’s essentially a Gothic horror story, with mad scientists and crazy creatures running amuck in town,” she says. “It’s like Jack the Ripper meets Frankenstein, but there’s also love and pretty ladies in it.”
Similar to her character Emma, Wicks inadvertently acts as a guiding light for upcoming graduates. As for Wicks’ advice on moving forward professionally after college, she keeps it simple.
“Just be ready to climb the ladder. Don’t get discouraged,” she said. “If you have to do side jobs for a while, do it.”
Agh! What were you thinking? Did you and I see the same show,  or could the quality of sound, voice, accent and even pitch accuracy of Constantine Maroulis be so dramatically different from performance to performance? His opening scenes were ear-splittingly painful.  His wandering accent was a complete distraction. I wonder who was responsible for directing or allowing this performance?  When Marsoulis sang Hyde he found his stride, but was always in the shadow of a professional cast. The strongest part of Marsoulis’ apprenticeship was his extraordinary physical presence and gestures.  Bravo!
To be sure, the music is derivative as I found myself humming tunes from such diverse sources as ” Le Miz,” “Fiddler on the Roof,” “Cabaret,” and eve Barry Manilow. Nonetheless, Teal Wicks actually sold the reworking of “I Can’t  Live Without You” in the guise of “Once Upon a Dream.”  Deborah Cox added tremendous depth to Lucy not allowing her talent distract the audience.
Fun fact!  Frank Wildhorn, who wrote the music for J&H, was a Trojan!

The Undergraduate Student Government does the student body a great service in many respects: Members of the organization work around the clock to keep students informed and involved and Program Board, which is nestled under USG, successfully brings a variety of compelling events and high-profile speakers to campus.
But one matter that needs examining in light of the USG election is internal spending within the organization. Last year, the USG president made about $11,000 while USG vice president made just under $9,000 for the academic year. Senators each made about $2,000 and Program Board and USG directors made about $4,500.
The Daily Trojan believes USG and Program Board senior members should receive proper compensation for the long hours they spend working to better student life. We do not, however, believe the current amount of internal spending on salaries is the most effective way to use USG funds. Even considering that all salaried members are active, current spending seems excessive for an organization with a $2 million annual budget; it seems that many of these annual stipends could be reduced and still adequately compensate our representatives.
USG already has an impetus to carefully evaluate some of its finances in light of administrative changes in the past year. For example, Program Board might need an increase in funds because the university’s new security policy means more security staff will likely be hired for larger events, such as Springfest. Because programming directly impacts students most immediately, it should continue be a priority for USG as a whole, especially in light of reorganizing internal spending.
Meanwhile, USG should also examine how involvement and action are factored into pay within its various departments.Senior members of USG have access to university officials in a way that is unique and important, and there is no doubt that the continued efforts of USG members will lead to impactful results in the near future and beyond. But across-the-board salaries for USG members, particularly senators and directors, might not be optimal if there are significant differences in the time and effort given between individuals. Though all USG members play an important role, it would be beneficial to assess whether each individual’s salary appropriately correlates to tangible results.
The current system also potentially brings other problems, including creating an incentive for students to run for positions or get involved because of the salary and privileges, which include frequent contact with high-level university administration that no other students come close to having. Student leaders should obviously take on USG roles to serve the undergraduate population, and service requires sacrifice. Certainly, members of USG sacrifice their time, but their work should be compensated in a way that still optimizes overall spending, especially when their salaries are funded by the student population at large.
Regardless of who wins this year’s election, the new president and vice president should seriously re-evaluate USG’s spending. Undergraduate students pay $57.50 each semester for USG. As much of that money as possible should go back to the students, and internal reform could help USG reach new heights in upcoming years.

Second semester of senior year can be a tough time for any college student, as graduation looms and job applications, resumes and attending the USC Career Fair become the new norm. Yet USC graduates looking for a job might have one less thing to worry about. Because of the overwhelming influence of social media applications, companies are thinking twice about firing their employees — at least in ways that lead to viral videos and media outrage. Companies, such as HMV and Applebee’s, have recently faced extreme criticism from the public after fired employees took to social media to recover from the experience.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
Websites, such as Yelp or Glassdoor, are even giving consumers a public platform to vent against immoral companies, and the results are tremendous. Corporate higher-ups are becoming more and more careful about the way they treat their employees, and as technology progresses, it’s clear that they should be.
Fortunately for college students, the gap in technological proficiency that hinders companies doesn’t generally exist for students in this day and age. For modern students, using social media is a part of everyday life and, after a point, second nature.
As a result, students have a powerful tool at their disposal that didn’t exist before: social media strategy. Personal branding through social media is a skill that students can utilize and use strategically in the corporate world. And if the recent firing controversies are any indication, they definitely should.
The prevalance of social media in today’s society has forced companies to rethink their normal business practices. Chelsea Welch, a former Applebee’s waitress, was fired from her position for uploading a picture of a customer’s receipt onto the website Reddit. On the receipt, the customer wrote, “I give God 10 percent. Why should you get 18?” Welch posted the picture on the popular image-sharing website as a way to vent her frustration, but when the angry customer contacted Applebee’s to share the story, Welch lost her job.
This decision was faced with almost unanimous public criticism. Welch’s posting eventually went viral, as angry online commenters wrote letters, planned sit-ins and vowed to never eat at Applebee’s again. Applebee’s management was criticized for not handling the situation well, and the Harvard Business Review described the whole event as a “PR nightmare.”
Yet the meaning behind the debacle might have favorable implications for new employees and even students. Companies and organizations who previously had free reign to treat their employees without any regard with the consequences now face a degree of transparency that forces them to employ honest business practices.
Businesses would be wise to learn from Applebee’s mistakes. When firing Welch, upper-level managers made a grave error in judgment: They discounted the value and power of social media platforms. With technology comes transparency, and every individual has an outlet to voice their opinions and tell their stories. Companies are now forced to maintain positive Yelp and Glassdoor profiles or face a decrease in customer traffic.
“This year, the Internet, a mass medium for barely a decade, ushered in fundamental changes in the way people access information, share ideas and connect to each other,” said journalist Kristi Heim in The Seattle Times. “with Web logs, the Internet became a global slate for anyone to express an opinion, debate issues and connect with like-minded people.”
Unfortunately for corporations, the change has meant that every move a company makes is subject to criticism at even an international level. One misstep could cause a company to lose a significant amount of business, and it is a risk that no company should take.
The only solution for businesses is to get social media savvy as quickly as possible and consider many different perspectives of a situation before jumping to action. As business analyst Lise Buyer stated in an article, “The fact is that the lines of communication from the executive suite to the front lines are stronger and better than ever before. Savvy chief honchos understand and embrace that new reality. Individual employees can actually try to make a real difference. The individual is louder than it has ever been since the Industrial Revolution.”
USC students graduating in the spring could benefit from knowing that they have a powerful tool at their disposal as they enter the workforce upon graduation. The traditional power structure of companies is shifting to include even the lowest in the corporate totem pole. At the same time, effortlessness of social media is a double-edged sword, and it’s important to remember that students can fall prey to the same easy access of information that empowers them.
Discretion and the intelligent use of social media tools are becoming the new corporate power tools. As graduation day nears, students should consider the image of themselves that they project to the public on a daily basis. If Applebee’s story is any indication, social media savvy is an invaluable tool that even the best PR department can’t replace.

Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson will resign June 30, President C. L. Max Nikias announced in a letter addressed to the USC community.
The provost’s office will conduct a national search to fill the position of vice president for student affairs soon, according to the letter. Jackson will take a one-year sabbatical from USC and return as emeritus vice president and executive director of International Advancement. He will also continue to teach in the Rossier School of Education.
Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“For 18 years, Dr. Jackson has served in this key leadership role with tremendous distinction, assisting the university in its efforts to become a top destination for students around the world, as well as a fully residential university,” Nikias said in the letter. “Dr. Jackson has touched countless students with his vision and compassion, and I know the entire USC community joins me in commending his outstanding service.”
Jackson oversaw key changes to the university including the expansion of several programs in Student Affairs, such as the Career Center and orientation programs, as well as the construction of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Residential College at Parkside and the Arts and Humanities Residential College. His department also added the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Center, the Office of Veterans and Transfer and the Office of Parent Programs. As vice president for student affairs, Jackson’s department oversees the Office of Student Publications, which includes the Daily Trojan.
At a What Matters to Me and Why event last year, Jackson said he believes part of God’s plan is that love gets actualized when communities care for one another.
“How I go about spreading this love is the work I do in this role as a Vice President for Student Affairs at USC,” Jackson said. “I work with the goal of providing environments that allow others to thrive and fulfill their dreams and their hopes so they can go out and spread peace and love.”
Nikias said Jackson’s contributions have shaped the direction of the university for years to come.
“As we acknowledge Dr. Jackson’s stellar service to USC, we wish him continued sucess in the next phase of his career,” Nikias said. “His contributions to this university are both extensive and exceptional, and for this, we are all truly grateful.”
I still think “Thriller” is your best album
This is certainly a step in the right direction inasmuch as Jackson approved and is responsible for the Halloween event that resulted in shootings on our beloved campus.  The next logical step is to remove the newly erected fence around USC to remind the community that USC does not fear or distrust its neighbors.  USC has survived for 133 years without a perimeter barrier.  A lack of judgment is what caused the security breach on Halloween, not the lack of a fence, Jersey barriers or other such gauntlets.
