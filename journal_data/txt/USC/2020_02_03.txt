Taylor Swift is a human being. That’s the lesson at the core of her “Miss Americana” documentary.
Since the infamous Kanye West moment at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, it’s easy to see how Swift’s humanity might have been lost. In a world where celebrities become products to market on social media, “Miss Americana” is a fresh reminder that people — even those with millions following them on Instagram or buying their albums — have private lives, problems and emotions.
If you are a fan of Swift, the documentary does not reveal anything terribly new. Rather, it takes viewers into the processes of creating a No. 1 album, caring for family and posting a picture on Instagram that reaches more than a hundred million people, eliciting a reaction from the president of the United States.
Having built a reputation (pun kind of intended) of calculation, strategy and likeability, Swift is vulnerable and confident in the notion that she does not have to please everybody. For Swift, the personal becomes political. And the documentary shows why she’s not wrong to do so.
“[I was] frozen at the age I became famous,” said Swift, who first appeared on the Billboard charts at 16 years old. In some of the most emotional scenes in the film, Swift discusses her battle with an eating disorder, a sexual assault and how these trials and tribulations led to her political awakening.
In the back of a car on the way to a sold-out stadium show, Swift leaves her New York City apartment in a scene of the documentary with a huge crowd of fans and paparazzi alike waiting outside her front door. She references a picture from the previous day and says looking at that picture almost sent her spiraling back to 2015 when she wouldn’t eat for days. Swift points out that society makes it “impossible” for women to exist in their bodies due to constant criticism — a moment that showcases her newfound social consciousness. It’s clear throughout the documentary that she feels a stronger affinity to fight against the mistreatment of women, culminating in the urgency of her sexual assault trial.
After the scene discussing her sexual assault trial in Colorado, where she notably won her suit for a single dollar, we see Swift face the political head on. In her dressing room, she battles with her dad on whether to endorse former Democratic Tennessee  Gov. Phil Bredesen and speak out against Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn. This moment captures the intertwinement of the personal and political for Swift. She points out to her dad that Blackburn is not in favor of the Violence Against Women Act, which protects women from domestic abuse and stalking. She emphasizes the importance of the act to protect against stalking, referencing an incident where a man broke into her house and slept in her bed while she was on tour. 
As a theme, the documentary traces professional highs with personal lows. When Swift won Album of the Year in 2016 for a second time for “1989,” she felt alone. 
“Shouldn’t I have somebody that I could call?” Swift said. “I had nobody to share the moment with.” 
On the flip side, the film also illustrated her personal highs along with her professional lows. When the whole world was partaking in the #taylorswiftisoverparty, she met her boyfriend English actor Joe Alwyn. 
“It was happiness without somebody else’s input … just happy,” Swift said. 
Lana Wilson, director of “Miss Americana,” effectively captured the nuances and continued difficulty of growing up in front of the world. Now that Swift seems to have captured a perfect balance of living privately and being a public figure, she appears to be more confident than ever. 
In the final moments of the documentary, we watch Swift perform at the VMAs once again. This time on her own terms, keeping the microphone in her own hands, coming full circle from the 2009 incident. And, as that moment plays on screen, we hear lyrics from “The Archer:” “Combat, I’m ready for combat.”
Collectively, this final scene says it all. It’s her voice. It’s her words. And she isn’t backing down any time soon.

It’s fitting to welcome the end of dry January and start of 2020 with an exploration of my favorite wine hotspots around Los Angeles. In all honesty, I did not participate in dry January. In fact, I failed at that New Years’ resolution on day one, but who’s keeping track? 
Regardless of the success or failure of our resolutions, 2020 might just be the year that some of us (like yours truly) graduate or, at least, graduate from Trader Joe’s wines. 
Nestled in the historic center of downtown L.A., Mignon is one of the best-kept wine secrets of the entire city. With an emphasis on Old World (countries or regions where wine-making first originated) natural wines, this wine bar is sure to enchant you with its journey into French vineyards and Italian villas at the low-cost comfort of a simple Uber or Metro ride. On a more personal note, pairing the Escargots à la Bourguignonne with a glass of Kabaj Amfora 2008 ($17) from Slovenia is a match made in heaven. For the less adventurous (understandable that snails aren’t everyone’s cup of tea), Mignon offers a diverse selection of European dishes and a good variety of wine choices. 
Close by in Culver City, Stanley’s Wet Goods is one of my favorite group wine outing spaces. At Stanley’s, patrons can purchase wine or beer or enjoy selections from the on-site bar, a popular concept in L.A. dining. In such a cozy social space, one can lose track of how many glasses of wine they drink. Not speaking from personal experience, of course! A major advantage for the college student is Stanley’s happy hour with its affordable selection of house wine throughout the week. If you aren’t a wine connoisseur, this is a good place to start; The people are friendly and more than willing to give you pointers. 
Perhaps, if you’re just like the million other people in L.A. obsessed with nature and the outdoors (hot take: when people in L.A. refer to the outdoors, it’s not really the outdoors), Melody wine bar might be your vibe. Located in the heart of the Virgil Village, this space is meant for lovers of casual patio drinking who also enjoy the warmth of the L.A. outdoors. If you love to pair your wine with pasta or tacos, this is the place to be. Los Pilares Rosé 2014 ($14) from San Diego is my go-to first glass at Melody. The menu of wines is easy to navigate and has something for everyone. Some bottles are quite expensive, so it might be a good idea to journey to Melody with curious, like-minded drinking friends. 
The convenience of Trader Joe’s and Target for our wine cannot be overstated; after all, it’s a walk or Fryft away for most of us. But the magic of studying here in the City of Angels is the wide range of options that are readily available for those who actively and smartly seek them out. Your wine experience here should not be any different. While we may finally gain some comfort with the wine selection in USC Village, it’s time we get out of the uni gates and embrace the drinking experiences in the city.

The classical Greek tragedy of Orpheus and the lost maiden Eurydice usually follows the hero’s cunning journey into the Underworld, but playwright Sarah Ruhl and composer Matthew Aucoin flipped this script.
Music enthusiasts and opera aficionados filled Bovard Auditorium for “The Life and Afterlife of Eurydice (and Orpheus) in Opera” Thursday to celebrate the debut of the new opera “Eurydice,” which opened at the Los Angeles Opera Feb. 1 and runs through Feb. 23. 
This Visions and Voices event is part of a larger “Eurydice Found” arts showcase surrounding the opera’s debut, featuring special performances by singers from L.A. Opera’s Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artists Program.
 The new opera “Eurydice” focuses on the heroine’s decision to leave the realm of shadows and follow her love back to the world of the living — only to fall back again due to a twist of fate.
Aucoin, who is also an L.A. Opera artist in residence, said that the pair had been working on the piece for more than three years.
“It took me a while to realize this, but this is not really an opera that just tells the story of the myth from the other perspectives,” Aucoin said. “It rather takes the myth as a starting point for meditation on love and loss and memory.”
During the panel, both artists discussed how the creative process of transforming Ruhl’s 2003 play into “Eurydice” felt “seamless.” Aucoin added that opera was the best way to take the story in a new direction.
“That sense of music’s transcendent power that made it so appealing,” Aucoin said. “And I think, ‘OK, well that’s what makes it appealing to music. But what about opera specifically?’ And I think because opera is an art form obsessed with suffering and that kind of cathartic transformation of suffering into pleasure [and] finding that fine line between pain and pleasure.”
Ruhl said he was originally fascinated by the Orphic myth because most of the existing art explored only one side of the story — the male perspective. Ruhl read a portion of the opera during the panel that explores how Eurydice is able to share her love and pain in both of Ruhl’s renditions.
“This is what it is to love an artist” said Ruhl, reading from the opera score. “Inside his head, he is always going away from him. Inside his head, there is something more beautiful … This is what it is to love an artist, this is what it is to love.” 
While the opera aims to evoke raw emotion and comment on human imperfection, Ruhl said he was adamant about using humor to counteract suffering in the opera’s score. 
“I felt really lucky that Matt had this sneaky way to musicals and humor like finding the rhythm of humor,” Ruhl said. “It was always important to me in the play that any type of grief was getting too soft and too soggy. The stones would come in and be funny. So that the laughter opens you up, in fact, to her grief.”
Joy Zhong, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, said they enjoyed the panel because it introduced them to a larger conversation about Greek mythology and its intersection with classical music.
“I don’t have the most educated ears in opera,” Zhong said. “But I’m really interested in Greek mythology, Greek classics and plays and Wagner but all those things [Ruhl] referenced that I didn’t get inspire me to look more into it.”
Elizabeth Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry, said the panel discussion was interesting because the opera transfers ancient Greek myths to the current era.
“I thought it was really interesting to see the behind-the-scenes of the event, like where it comes from and then also their different interpretation of the story of Orpheus, like rather than from Orpheus’ perspective, it was more about Eurydice,” Nguyen said. “I thought it was really interesting how they pulled out the aspect of her with her father … I feel like that really resonates with a lot of people. Everyone [has] experienced, some type of loss and [ask], ‘If I only have one more day to talk to them,’ or something, So I thought that was pretty cool.” 
The intersection of modern activity and otherworldly repercussions make “Eurydice” an opera  relevant to audiences of all ages, said Stacy Brightman, the vice president for Education & Community Engagement at L.A. Opera.
“This is an opera that’s about to manage the dimension of both worlds, you know, life and death and it’s also about something I think every single one of us has experienced no matter what your nationality, no matter what your age,” Brightman said. “One of the big themes of this is love. What does it mean to love somebody? Would it mean to lose somebody? And what does it mean to intentionally lose somebody?” 
Students who do not have the chance to see the opera in person can attend one of the many art events surrounding the “Eurydice” world premiere, such as a performance by musicians from L.A. Opera at the USC Brain and Creativity Institute Feb 6. Brightman, who is in charge of organizing the L.A. Opera’s “Eurydice Found” Festival, said that the festivals bring community members together to explore different facets of the tragic and often one-sided myth. 
“And so it really is something that demands some investigation, some thought,” Brightman said. “[It is] the opportunity to — and this is what I love about our festivals is the way we do this — honestly it’s about going out to other experts and thinkers and artists around Los Angeles and asking them, ‘Why do you think this myth endures? Why do you think the story of Eurydice is important now?’ And really, people sharing ownership of the entire experience.”
