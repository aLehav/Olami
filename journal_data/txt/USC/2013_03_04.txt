Miscellaneous incidents
at 12:48 a.M. on March 2, DPS officers responded to a report of a staff member driving recklessly inside Parking Structure A and detained her for investigation. The officers determined that the staff member was intoxicated, and she was arrested by LAPD officers.
at 2:39 A.M. on March 1, DPS officers responded to a report of an intoxicated student involved in an altercation with fraternity members after being asked to leave a party at the Sigma Phi Epsilon house.  The fraternity members stated that the student was forcibly removed from the party due to his belligerent behavior and he subsequently urinated on the front lawn.  The student remained belligerent when contacted by the officers and he was allowed to leave after refusing to cooperate with their investigation.
at 12:49 A.M. on March 1, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a student sleeping in the alley behind the Alpha Phi sorority house and contacted him to check on his welfare.  The student was intoxicated, but the officers found him to be coherent and he declined medical treatment.  The student was then transported to his residence and released.
at 7:52 P.M. on Feb. 28, DPS officers responded to a student who collided with the rear driver’s side door of a university vehicle when it was opened in her path while she was riding her bicycle near 32nd and Figueroa streets.  The student was not injured, and there was no damage to her bike or the vehicle.
at 3:24 P.m. on Feb. 28, a student was cited to Judicial Affairs for failure to comply with DPS officers enforcing the bike ban at 34th St. and McClintock Ave. and attempting to elude them to avoid being detained.
at 2:32 P.m. on Feb. 28, an underage student was cited to the Student Judicial Affairs Council for using another student’s ID to purchase alcohol at a restaurant at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

The Muslim Student Union kicked off Islam Awareness Week Monday with an informational event called Islam 101. Speakers Zienab Abdelgany and Yasmin Nouh from the Council on American Islamic Relations gave students in attendance a brief introduction to the history and practices of Islam.
The event covered basic information about the world’s second-largest religion, giving a brief history of its origins, outlining its core beliefs and debunking common misconceptions, including gender roles and prayer practices.
“I got to learn more about the fundamentals of Islam,” said Adedayo Adenuga, a first-year student in the master’s aerospace and mechanical engineering program.
Islam Awareness Week is an initiative by the MSU to spotlight the Muslim community as an integral component of campus diversity and to shed more light on a religion that many students might not know much about.
MSU External Vice President Mushfiqur Chowdhury said the goal of Islam Awareness Week is to educate people about Muslim life in the university and throughout the world
“The MSU is trying to expose the stigmas, stereotypes, misnomers and negative connotations of the Muslim community in general by providing information and knowledge about Muslims so we can have a better, more cohesive USC community,” Chowdhury said.
MSU President Nashwah Akhtar said the ultimate goal of the event is to allow USC’s Muslim students to educate their peers within the university community.
“I think that people’s main knowledge of Islam does not come from Muslims, which is worrying,” Akhtar said. “We just want to be really open and have people engage with us to get their information.”
Upcoming events for Muslim Awareness Week will highlight Islam and the sciences, videos about Islam and a hijab day on Thursday. The week will conclude with Friday prayer at Masjid Omar ibn Al-Khattab.
The History of the Village of Qurayza:
Mohammed and his bloodthirsty men captured the city of Qurayza.
They then beheaded 600 to 900 men and pubescent boys.
They then enslaved the women and children.
This history is from Islamic texts.
….
Can anyone imagine a prophet participating in killing, stealing, enslaving?
Witha prophet like this is it any wonder that Muslims for the last 1,4000 centuries have copied Mohammed’s actions just as we are seeing them do today?
Or did they teach this?

In another story the Western media apparently refuses to cover, any Palestinian who dares to criticize Hamas or the Palestinian Authority risks being arrested or summoned for interrogation.
Palestinian journalists are now hoping to bring this to the attention of President Barack Obama when he meets with President Mahmoud Abbas next month.
The journalists say they want United States and the rest of the world to know that the crackdown on freedom of expression in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip is designed to hide the fact that Palestinians are governed by two repressive regimes that have no respect for human rights and democracy.
And did they teach this?
.
The world’s leading jailer of journalists- even exceeding Iran and China, which came in second and third respectively – is Turkey. Its ruler is the Islamist Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who once said “Democracy is like a train. We shall get out when we arrive at the station we want.”
Did they teach this?
.
“To clarify: Wahhabism is the only officially recognized and allowed religion in Saudi Arabia. Other forms of Islam and other religions are banned and persecuted by the state. Saudi Arabia is the only Islamic state in which there is no church, no synagogue and no other place of worship of any other religion. Shiite Muslims have been systematically discriminated against for decades. Jews are even forbidden to enter the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia practices a form of Sharia law that is one of the most brutal systems in the world. Saudi Arabia has at all times rejected the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. Women may not drive a car and can be punished by flogging. Corporal punishment, including amputations and executions, are part of everyday life in the country. Just two weeks ago a Sudanese immigrant in Saudi Arabia was publicly beheaded for ‘sorcery.’ Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world in which the death penalty is enforced even on teenagers,” the paper said.
Please remind us again how insensitive and ignorant we are as this faith continues to bleed the middle east.
One must be very ignorant in order to take the actions of the minority and broaden it in order to apply it to a whole group of people. Now if such a concept were plausible then all Americans would be racists, all Germans would be antisemitic, and the list goes on . As educated USC students we know that is not a fair way of labeling people. Now we live in america and freedom of speech is a right, but one must still speak the truth rather than reiterate lies that they picked up from the news.
Peace:)
It’s disheartening that some people still express themselves with intolerance and misunderstanding toward peaceful members of their own Trojan Family. I appreciate all of the commenters who voice their educated opinions in a pacific manner.
Dear Gt Drew:
Thanks for sharing what you really think about Islam, it’s important for us, Muslims, to know how people think about Islam, even if these thoughts  weren’t right. That’s actually why we are organizing this week of events.
We’re doing so to educate people about our true religion, not the one presented through subjective, biased, and uneducated sources.
We will be more than happy to have you in any of our events this week or any other time to talk to you.
You can also come to our info table tomorrow on Trousdale, near Tommy Trojan, from 10am to 2pm to discuss whatever you’re interested about knowing about Islam.
And I agree 100% with you that people’s actions represent what they are, and I call you to follow and observe the actions of the majority of muslims and how they interact with other people. (btw there is a plenty of them on Campus)
One last point, It’s important not judge a group by the actions of a stray and minor group of it, or else your judgment is not right. For example if you listen to the news and you observe all the reports on the crimes and murders that happen in LA for example, you’ll think that all the people in LA are criminals which is 100% wrong, the same goes for Islam or any other group, you can’t simply judge them by the extremist people who don’t represent the group by all means.
Regards,
Abdullah
What better way to learn about something than from the source…
What I’ve learned firsthand is that Muslims are kind and honest people, as their religion teaches.
Props the MSU for putting on this event.
At Gt Drew,
“Islams Actions SPEAK LOUDER than their Words…”
Do you mean Muslims? From what I’ve seen, Islam is something intangible that cannot simply pick up a sword and behead anyone even if it wanted to.
How many Muslims do you personally know? None of the Muslims I’ve met at USC, or anywhere, in fact, would do any of the things you’ve mentioned in your comment. Before you speak about an entire group, make sure you know your facts and have studied the subject.
Muslims are human, just like all of us. It’s near impossible to be perfect and follow every single tenant of their holy book and the example of their prophet. The rest of the world thinks that Islam supports the actions the terrorist groups commit because the terrorists say it does. Understand what Islam, the religion, preaches before attacking it for actions of the extremist minority who wrongly interpret what God says in their scripture.
There are 2 billion Muslims in the world; you can’t simply say all these 2 billion people have dreams of beheading the other 5 billion. Read up on it before you begin to point fingers blindly. Do I need to mention the Reconquista and other events like when Catholic nobility murdered 100,000 peasants for supporting Luther?
If all you know about Islam and its followers comes from what you see in the media and subjective sources, then all the luck to you. All I can hope for is that you begin to show some tolerance, kindness, and understanding. There have been some imperfections along the way, I admit. However, please tell me more about Christianity’s perfect history that does not include bloodshed, corruption in the church (by the way, you can still purchase indulgences if you’d like), mass murder of nonbelievers, and not following what the Bible says.
Peace.
P.S. Is there something wrong with your keyboard?
Religion can be good when used for good, all religions fit into this category. Islam is no different than any other religion in this respect.
Before you go cutting down other religions, think what your own people do in the name of their religion. No on is imune from the bad.
It’s fascinating that some people including commenters here allow fundamentalism to distort the truth about this religion. Just like in any other religion, fundamentalists have given a bad name to Islam and their ideas deviate from what should actually be practiced. Ignorance kills and education heals, morons.
How dumb & naive do you think USC students really are? Come on!
Islams Actions SPEAK LOUDER than their Words…
Cutting the heads off of those who disagree with them, enslaving
Women & children-treating them as “property”‘, using FEAR to keep
everyone in line, the list goes on and on and on…
It’s “my religion’ right or Wrong” and they HATE others who disagree with
it and will stoop to killing them to silence all opposition. Intolerant. Pathetic.
Any “faith” that has to use intimidation and threats to keep their people loyal and obedient should be upfront and responsible for their ACTIONS and their words.
Good luck trying to gloss over what you have done to other human beings…
We see you for who you are. No use trying to discuss Anything with you.
See how many people you can deceive here. This is the EASIEST religion to join
but the HARDEST one to get out of (alive).

Not worring at all.  In fact, it proves that people think for themselves and aren’t going to be swayed by propoganda and outright lies.

In today’s Los Angeles mayoral primary election, voters will choose two candidates to succeed Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
But though the wide slate of candidates might appear extremely diverse, Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Dan Schnur said that the candidates in this year’s Los Angeles mayoral contest don’t differ on most policy issues.
“If the issue differences aren’t as big, it’s only natural to focus on the differences in the candidates’ backgrounds. These candidates are a very smart and impressive group — but none of them are the type of larger-than-life personalities like Antonio Villaraigosa or Dick Riordan that we’ve seen in the past,” Schnur said.
Though there are similar goals in the candidates’ platforms, their mayoral plans and prior experiences distinguish them.
Eric Garcetti, a former professor in international relations at USC, takes much of his political experience from his council position. In addition to the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce naming Garcetti’s council district No. 1 in job growth, Garcetti’s achievements include building 31 parks in his district, tripling his district’s total number of parks.
According to a USC Sol Price School of Public Policy/Los Angeles Times poll conducted last week, Garcetti has a close lead at 27 percent.
For Garcetti, his focus is on increasing job opportunities, especially for students coming out of universities.
“First and foremost, we want to keep the young people graduating from USC with a first-class education with youth and vigor here in Los Angeles and we want to create opportunities for those students,” said Yusef Robb, Garcetti’s Deputy Chief of Staff. “Right now, way too many people are graduating from college with high levels of debt and low levels in terms of career prospects.”
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Additionally, Garcetti plans to develop partnerships between the city of Los Angeles and its universities in order to move ideas from the classroom to the boardroom.
“There is no reason why people who are being educated in Los Angeles should be leaving our city as soon as they earn their degrees,” Robb said. “We want to keep them here — it’s good for them and it’s good for our economy.”
Alexander VanRoekel, a senior double majoring in political science and economics, said Garcetti’s modern approach to problem solving makes him a unique candidate.
“He is focused on things like green jobs,” VanRoekel said. “Even something as small as Garcetti’s 311 app. I think it’s an important way of seeing actually how he solves problems in the 21st century way.”
The other frontrunner, Wendy Greuel, has  25 percent of the projected vote according to the Price/L.A. Times Poll. Greuel has a strong focus on creating jobs, as do many of her competitors. Her previous experiences include working in the private sector for DreamWorks Animation SKG and running a small family business. Greuel’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“She has audited the city and found $160 million in wasteful spending that could go back to schools and creating jobs,” said Kaya Masler, a Wendy Greuel campaign staff member. “She really has her thumb on the economic issues our city is facing,”
Masler said Greuel’s experience qualifies her for the role of mayor.
“She has been in the city’s politics since she was 17,” Masler said. “She knows how to do the job and she’s really the only person who is going to do the job to bring the jobs home.”
Masler believes the little practical things matter as well as the larger scale ones.
“She was known as the ‘pot hole queen’ because there were so many pot holes in her neighborhood when she was in the city council that people were getting hurt and she was like ‘I need to fix this’ and she fixed it,” Masler said.
Greuel’s platform highlights job creation, continued progress with the Los Angeles Unified School District, prioritizing spending to increase public safety and promoting greener transportation practices.
Kevin James is currently standing at 15 percent in the Price/Times poll. Not only is he the only Republican in the race, but he is also the only candidate of the four top candidates who has not previously served on city council.
“My party registration has little to do with the way I would manage the city,” James said. “It’s the independence I bring to the race to be able to get the new reforms that we need in the city of Los Angeles passed that should be very attractive to kids at USC.”
Many of James’ student supporters see his independence from city council as a definite plus.
“I think the biggest thing with Kevin James is that he really is a city hall outsider, so he’s not stuck in the system,” said USC College Republicans president Madeline Lansky. “I think that there’s a lot of corruption that has gone on in city hall. In the meantime, [the other candidates] were already in city hall and did nothing to stop the corruption or seek it out when they were there.”
James identifies himself as an “independent outsider in the race” and believes this allows him to connect well with USC students.
“One of the things we need is for young people and USC graduates to have a welcoming job environment when [they] graduate,” James said. “The choices you should be making should be about which jobs you want in Los Angeles rather than trying to choose what city outside of California you are going to move to because you can’t find the job in Los Angeles. That’s what has been happening too much.”
James’ other platform points include job creation, business tax reform, pension reform and public education reforms including vocational training as early as middle school.
Jan Perry prides herself in the tangible results she has recorded during her past 12 years on the city council, including the creation of more than 5,000 new units of affordable mixed income housing, the addition of 90,000 net new jobs in Los Angeles and her work as the former chairperson of the Los Angeles Exposition Line. The Price/Times poll currently has Perry at 14 percent.
Perry comes from a family of Trojans. She attended USC for both her undergraduate and graduate education, her husband came to USC for law school and her daughter, a current Annenberg student, will graduate this spring.
“I understand the depth and breadth of what it means to ‘fight on’ and, in the face of even the most complicated, I think that USC has taught me to bring all I have to creating solutions,” Perry said. “[My priority is] moving this city forward toward an economic recovery and a level playing field so that children here will have a chance to have a decent education [and] people will have choices on where they want to live and job opportunities for where they want to work.”
Perry currently represents the area surrounding the university and has made an effort to remain involved with the university by speaking at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Price School of Policy, Planning and Development.
“I have been very active in campus life as a graduate and as a public servant, and I would continue to do that and raise the profile of the university and all the other excellent learning institutions we have in our city,” Perry said.
Perry’s primary focuses include education, making Los Angeles a greener city, increasing job opportunities and reforming the Department for Work and Pensions.
Though the differences between the four candidates aren’t staggering, Schnur said the runoff promises for a more distinctive election.
“Once the field narrows from several candidates to just two, the differences between the remaining two in the run-off will become much more clear to the voters,” Schnur said. “Five candidates on a debate stage can be sort of a muddle to even the most attentive of voters but, when it’s one-on-one, the differences start to crystallize.”

The multiple Café 84 closures last week were caused by the ongoing construction of the McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The dining hall was shut down for part of the day on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday after construction in the area shut off the hall’s hot water source.
Construction on the swim stadium began this semester. The stadium pool was built in 1984 for the Olympics and the construction will add a new sundeck for audiences to view swimming events and locker rooms for the water polo and swim and dive teams. Café 84 and EVK Restaurant and Grill were renovated during the summer.
The recurring problems arise from Café 84’s electronically controlled steam boiler that is located below the swim stadium, according to Kristian Klinger, the director of USC Hospitality.
Klinger said that it is a health and safety issue for dining halls to not have access to hot water and the cafe cannot be open until the problem is resolved.
The first incident occurred Tuesday after construction crews removed a poorly built flagpole footing that was attached to the natural gas line, according to Klinger. As the footing was pulled out, the gas line was ruptured and the heating system was turned off until the break was repaired.
The dining hall’s steam boiler was turned off again Wednesday when construction crews re-powered the lighting in the pool. An electrical short in the pool area had to be traced and corrected before the crew could get the heater functioning again.
As crews continued demolishing the footing and basement of the old swim building, vibrations from the equipment activated the steam boiler’s seismic valve and shut off the boiler. The valve detects any seismic energy, such as in the case of an earthquake.
Klinger said each incident was resolved as quickly as possible and that USC’s Hospitality department will work with construction crews more closely so that problems like these will not happen again.
“Emergencies do occur and we do our best to work through them in an efficient and effective manner,” Klinger said. “We are doing everything we can to avoid these types of issues in the future by continuing to work with our campus partners on ways to improve communication and collaboration and scheduling on future projects.”
Students, such as Jordanae Walker, a freshman majoring in political science, first learned of the situation when they saw the dining hall’s closed doors. Walker believes the alert system for dining hall closures should be improved.
“It was really inconvenient for me, and I wish they had at least given out some warning that the hall wasn’t going to be open,” Walker said.
Some students are concerned about the amount of planning and foresight that has been done on the construction project.
“The construction crews should really be more careful with what they are doing,” said Analisa Kleinman, a senior majoring in art history. “Students live right in that area in Fluor and Webb Tower, and it just makes me worry that they could make a mistake that affects more than just our dining halls.”
The EVK dining hall was also forced to close down a few weeks ago.
“The EVK closure on Sunday [Feb.] the 10th was due to a plumbing issue,” Klinger said. “Rust was coming through the water in every area except the dish room.”
According to Klinger, there is no indication that its closure is related to demolition ofMcDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Alisha Mathalikunnel, a sophomore majoring in psychology, hopes that these inconveniences will be worth it once the swim stadium opens in April 2014.
“Accidents happen when areas are under construction. It’s bound to happen,” Mathalikunnel said. “At least it will be nice once the upgrades are done and we are able to see events at the swimming pool.”

Program Board and EdMonth kicked off its second-annual monthlong initiative on the state of education Monday at Bovard Auditorium with a panel discussion on igniting the next generation of leaders.
Shine bright · Grammy award-winning singer John Legend urges students to take charge of their education Monday at Bovard Auditorium. — Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
 
EdMonth aims to bring awareness of the education inequality to students both at USC and at other universities.
Opening remarks were presented by David Dwyer, founder of USC Hybrid High School, who highlighted the university’s innovative approaches to education with the new school through the three pillars of personalization, time and connectedness.
Grammy Award-winning artist and philanthropist John Legend spoke on education as the foundation that helps students succeed in their talents and career interests. He focused on the importance of education as a right for all students no matter what challenging environment they might come from.
“If we think demography is destiny, we will allow our school system to confirm that belief,” Legend said.
The event, moderated by Marshall School of Business Professor David Belasco, expressed teaching as an incomparable business.
“Out of all of the problems in the world, education is the one thing that can solve others,” Belasco said.
Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy expressed the need for every student to pursue an education in current economic times. He put the state’s priorities into perspective, comparing the approximate cost of $8,800 spent on each student in California versus the an average of $86,000 spent on each prison inmates in our country.
“The best form of economic stimulus is a diploma,” Deasy said.
CEO of Camino Nuevo Charter Academy Ana Ponce touched upon the need for students to feel that they deserve an education without being restricted by an undocumented status.
“I believe that every kid can have the right to education,” Ponce said. “I’m a Camino Nuevo girl, I grew up undocumented and if I did it then every single kid in that neighborhood can do it.”
Kevin Sanchez, who runs Students for Educated Reform and is an EdMonth co-founder, said it was great to have a nonpolitical conversation about education reform in a “hands-on, gloves-off” approach, which he feels people don’t really have.
“This is just great because it allows people that aren’t educated about what’s going on to become educated and come out to other events or get involved politically or directly with the kids,” Sanchez said.
Students who also might have come to see John Legend were inspired by the event and the call to action for education reform in California.
“I ended up learning more than I expected to. I think its an interesting prospective because I’m from New York, so I don’t really know that much about California education,” said Ashley Seruya, a freshman majoring in narrative studies.
The panelists ended the discussion urging students to become leaders by simply helping younger students with their personal statements with college or showing them around their school campus. Hrag Hamalian, founder and head of Valor Academy, said that the best way for college students to get involved in education reform is to visit students and and be a role model that they can look up to.
“Come and speak to our kids,” Hamalian said. “Students will relate to you more than anyone else.”
“Out of all of the problems in the world, education is the one thing that can solve others,” Belasco said.
I agree, completely. Education is the key to solving many of our problems.
Urging education reform? John Legend was a college dropout, perhaps he should go get an education!

One of the many corny sports idioms of the world is short, sweet and rhymed: “Teamwork makes the dream work.”
Cliched, to be sure, but the saying rings true in the athletic realm. In an individual sport, such as tennis, however, these words may not be as applicable as they are in a team-oriented sport.
So close · Freshman Max de Vroome (above) teamed with sophomore Eric Johnson to take second in the Pacific Coast Doubles Tournament. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
For USC’s men’s tennis team, though, different players seem to step up and make big plays each match. This weekend was no different. The No. 2 Trojans competed at the Pacific Coast Doubles championships in La Jolla, Calif., and this time it was the tandem of freshman Max de Vroome and sophomore Eric Johnson who led the way by placing second overall in a tournament with over 100 doubles teams competing.
The exhibition tournament was the first time de Vroome and Johnson have paired up this season. After losing the doubles point in the past three matches, USC head coach Peter Smith recognized the need for a change in the lineup, so he switched up the partnerships at the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles spots. De Vroome’s regular partner, sophomore Roberto Quiroz, paired up with his cousin, junior Emilio Gomez, who usually plays with Johnson.
“Partnerships grow stale,” Smith said. “We want to see motivated guys.  When they’re energized and their feet are moving, everything’s better.”
De Vroome and Johnson endured two close matches in the opening rounds of the tournament but found their rhythm and defeated teams from Cal, Rice and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps College to reach the semifinals, in which they faced Stanford’s Maciek Romanowicz and Robert Stineman, who usually play at the No. 3 spot for the Cardinal. De Vroome and Johnson rattled off an impressive 6-0, 6-3 win to put themselves in the finals.
The Trojans faced UCLA’s No. 1 doubles pair of Marcos Giron and Dennis Novikov in the finals. Until the finals, Giron and Novikov had dominated, not dropping a set throughout the whole tournament. De Vroome and Johnson became the first team to take a set over the Bruin pair but could not maintain momentum and ultimately fell in the championship match, 7-6 (5), 3-6, 4-6.
The other new doubles team, composed of Quiroz and Gomez, defeated teams from Rice and Toledo before falling to USC assistant coach Kris Kwinta and his former doubles partner from UCLA. On a light-hearted note, Smith nicknamed the new tandem of Quiroz and Gomez “The Ecuadorians,” as both hail from Guayaquil, Ecuador.
Junior Ray Sarmiento, who typically plays at the No. 1 doubles spot for USC with sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, played with volunteer assistant coach Peter Lucassen in the tournament. Hanfmann’s knee has been bothering him since the UCLA match on Feb. 22, and he did not travel with the team to San Diego. Sarmiento and Lucassen played well in their first two matches before falling to Stanford’s Romanowicz and Stineman. Sophomore Jonny Wang and junior Michael Grant also played two matches before being defeated by Adam Levie and Toki Sherbakov from UC Davis.
This tournament also allowed some of the less experienced Trojans to get some time on the court. Senior Michael Tang and sophomore Nick Hoyle partnered up but lost in the first round. Additionally, junior Corey Smith played with his younger brother, Keegan, but the duo lost in the first match.
The teams that were eliminated early spent the rest of the weekend enjoying the San Diego sunshine. The temperature hovered around 70 degrees each day and the waves crashed on the shore just a few steps away from the tennis courts. The players swam and kayaked in their spare time when they weren’t cheering their teammates on.
Smith is confident that the trip to San Diego strengthened the team dynamic and that the Trojans will be stronger in doubles going forward.
“This is the classic kind of half-way-through-the-season break where we do something a little different,” Smith said. “It’s a very relaxed atmosphere and arguably the most beautiful spot in the world. They definitely should come back to campus more relaxed.”
USC’s next match is scheduled for March 8 against Pepperdine at Marks Stadium.

It wasn’t exactly the finish they had hoped for, but the USC women’s swim and dive team made a strong showing at the Pac-12 conference championships this past week, finishing the meet in second place overall.
Full speed ahead · Senior Haley Anderson improved upon her record-setting career for the women’s swim team, taking home conference titles in the 500-yard freestyle and 1650-yard freestyle events. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The women’s Pac-12 championships, held this year in Federal Way, Wash., from Feb. 27 to Mar. 2, featured six of the nation’s top-25 teams. USC was hanging onto the No. 1 spot entering the meet, followed by No. 2 Cal, No. 4 Stanford, No. 6 Arizona, No. 14 UCLA and No. 23 Arizona State.
The Women of Troy started strong on Wednesday, finishing second in the 200-yard medley relay and third in the 800-yard freestyle relay to open the meet in third place. The 200-yard medley relay team, made up of senior Christel Simms, junior Kasey Carlson and freshmen Kendyl Stewart and Kasia Wilk, finished just 0.19 seconds behind Arizona, who had to leapfrog both USC and Cal to win the relay.
On day two, USC moved into second place with the strong swimming of Olympic silver medalist and senior Haley Anderson, the first women’s swimmer in conference history to take home three consecutive 500-yard freestyle titles.
Though they finished the day strong, all was not well for the Women of Troy on Thursday. After a poor showing in the morning preliminary rounds, senior Jessie Schmitt called a swimmers-only meeting before the evening’s final rounds began. Sparked by the display of senior leadership, the squad came to life, highlighted by a school record in the 200-yard freestyle relay by Carlson, Stewart, Wilk and freshman Jasmine Tosky.
Anderson, however, was not done breaking records. On Saturday, the senior became the first Pac-12 women’s swimmer to win four consecutive 1650-yard freestyle titles.
“While I may seem a bit biased, I think Haley should have been swimmer of the meet based on her four-year repeat as the 1650 champion,” USC head coach David Salo said. “We would not have come this close to winning the championship without her.”
Despite Anderson’s best efforts, the Trojans came up a bit short in the meet overall. Though they put up a school record of 1418.5 points, they finished 21 points behind eventual conference champion Stanford in the closest conference championship meet in Pac-12 history.
On the men’s side, USC began its quest for a conference title on Sunday. Entering the meet ranked fourth nationally, the Trojans have to compete against three other ranked conference rivals over the next two days for the crown: No. 2 Cal, No. 7 Stanford and No. 10 Arizona.
Against stiff competition, the team did not disappoint on the opening day, setting school records in both the   800-yard freestyle relay and the        200-yard medley relay.
The four-man squad of sophomore Chad Bobrosky, senior Alex Lendrum, sophomore Cristian Quintero and junior Dimitri Colupaev finished the 800-yard relay in 6:16.88, fast enough to beat Cal by nearly two seconds.
The race seemed out of reach after the first two legs, but Quintero sprinted ahead of the competition in the third, posting an incredible time of 1:32.58. Colupaev took over the race from Quintero and never looked back, posting a solid time of 1:33.83 to lock up the school record and USC victory.
In the 200-yard medley relay, the Trojans were just as impressive. The quartet of sophomore Luca Spinazzola, freshman Morten Klarskov and juniors Chase Bloch and Vladimir Morozov posted a school record time of 1:25.04, less than one second behind first-place Cal, but only good enough to finish fourth overall.
“It is always disappointing not to win a team relay,” Salo said. “It speaks to the depth of the conference when it takes a team record just to finish fourth. [Our players] know they can get better in a couple weeks for the NCAA championships, and I think the results will speak for themselves.”
The men’s team will continue its chase for the title until Wednesday, when the eventual champion will be crowned. Notables yet to race for the Trojans include freshman Jack Wagner, sophomore Dakota Hodgson and senior Justin DiFederico.
When the action concludes on Wednesday, all eyes will turn to Indianapolis, where the 2013 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships will be held. With a strong showing this week, expect the Trojans to be contenders when the NCAA finals begin on Mar. 21 for the women and Mar. 28 for the men.

The countdown began as soon as USC departed El Paso, Texas, on New Year’s Eve. The countdown continued in earnest as head coach Lane Kiffin announced a perhaps less-than-desirable recruiting class on national signing day. But the countdown to the 2013 season now takes a backseat.
Cue spring practice.
Battered and bruised after a 7-6 finish last fall, the Trojans return to Howard Jones Field on Tuesday for the first of 15 scheduled practices culminating with the annual spring game on April 13 at the Coliseum. It’s a chance to begin writing a new chapter, to turn the page and to begin healing the wounds following a nightmarish 2012 season that began with billboards of Heisman candidates on Broadway and ended with a now-infamous locker room brawl in the West Texas desert.
So as the program regroups this spring, in anticipation for the season opener at Hawai’i in August, here are five storylines to monitor:
A three-way quarterback battle
The race to replace Matt Barkley is on. The Trojans will look to settle on a successor for the former four-year starting signal caller this spring — though the competition could, of course, continue through fall camp. The contenders are redshirt sophomores Cody Kessler and Max Wittek, along with early freshman enrollee Max Browne.
Wittek, who served as the No. 2 quarterback on the depth chart a year ago and started games against Notre Dame and Georgia Tech, stands as the logical frontrunner. Measuring six-foot-four and 235 pounds, he certainly looks the part of a starter, a sort of throwback to the tall, strong-armed USC quarterbacks of years past a la Carson Palmer.
But he struggled mightily in the Sun Bowl. The former Mater Dei High School standout — yes, like Barkley — completed just 14 of 37 passes with one touchdown and three interceptions, seemingly launching every pass all the way to New Mexico.
Kessler stands as perhaps a safer choice, as he’s highly regarded for his accuracy and mobility, the former being a pressing need a year after the Trojans ranked 119th nationally in total interceptions with 20. Browne, the Gatorade National Football Player of the Year, is no doubt young, turning 18 in February, but is certainly capable as well.
Injured players returns
Spring practice also marks the return of two key players who missed all of last season because of injuries: converted redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden (a torn left knee ligament) and senior defensive end Devon Kennard (a torn pectoral muscle).
Madden, who weighs 220 pounds, is a slightly more bruising tailback, the type of runner USC has lacked in recent seasons. He impressed coaches during spring practice a year ago before his injury. Kennard, meanwhile, started five games in 2011 and very well could be named a preseason All-American. Both should provide depth at the very least and warrant quite a bit of playing time. Kennard, in fact, could start.
A revamped offensive line
USC’s offensive line struggled so much in 2012 that it’ll now have two position coaches tasked with overseeing the group: offensive line coach Mike Summers, who had previously been at Kentucky, and returning offensive line coach James Cregg. It appears they have their work cut out for them.
Gone is center Khaled Holmes, and there’s no doubt replacing the All-American captain stands atop the agenda. Redshirt sophomore Cyrus Hobbi is a candidate, having started last season’s game against Stanford. Then again, he might not be the staff’s first choice, having started last season’s game against Stanford. Other options include junior guard Marcus Martin, who reportedly has been playing the position during the team-only winter workouts, and incoming freshman Khaliel Rodgers, though he won’t arrive on campus until fall camp.
Solidifying the left tackle spot is another challenge, as the team never was able to settle on a full-time starter last season, alternating between then-freshman Max Tuerk and then-sophomore Aundrey Walker.
A young secondary 
How quickly a makeover for USC’s defense takes place largely hinges on how quickly its secondary can grow. Three of four starters from last season are gone -— safeties T.J. McDonald and Jawanza Starling and cornerback Nickell Robey.
Enter a pair of freshmen early enrollees: Su’a Cravens and Leon McQuay III. Both played safety in high school and will get a shot to play immediately. Redshirt junior Josh Shaw also returns and has proven capable of playing both the cornerback and safety positions previously.
A new staff
Kiffin’s staff has experienced quite a bit of turnovers in recent months. His father, Monte Kiffin, resigned as the team’s assistant head coach and de facto defensive coordinator. He’s now taken the same position with the Dallas Cowboys. In his place is Clancy Pendergast, the former Cal and NFL defensive coordinator. Others who have left include offensive coordinator Kennedy Polamalu, linebackers coach Scottie Hazelton and secondary coach Marvin Sanders.
Newcomers, meanwhile, include Summers as well as running backs coach Tommie Robinson and linebackers coach Mike Ekeler. Getting everyone on the same page becomes an immediate priority, especially considering how disjointed the team looked over the final stretch last season, losing four of its final five games.
As expected, USC’s to-do list for the spring is, no doubt, lengthy. Let the spring cleaning commence.

The USC men’s volleyball team faced another tough test this weekend with matches against Pacific and Stanford. Though the Trojans played well in both games, they would have to settle for only one win.
Aiming high · Freshman middle blocker Josh Kirchner (18) and redshirt sophomore outside hitter Joey Booth go for the block at the net. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The weekend’s first match pitted USC against the No. 15 Pacific Tigers, a team that has struggled as of late. Despite a number of impressive wins (including one against USC earlier this year), the Tigers entered the match on a five game-losing streak, and the Trojans were able to make it six.
Pacific took control early, winning the first set 25-23, but the Trojans would not back down. Thanks to a combined 23 kills from sophomores Joey Booth and Christian Rivera, USC won the next three sets 29-27, 25-16, 25-22 and took the match. Prior to this match, the Trojans had been winless after dropping the first set, giving this victory some extra significance.
“Playing hard is not going to guarantee every point and sometimes you’re going to go all out and lose the point, but you have to bounce back,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “They ended up beating us and then we bounced back. I was really proud of the way the guys fought and stuck with our plan.”
Unlike Pacific, Stanford has been playing its best volleyball in recent matches. Though likely exhausted after its five-set victory over Pepperdine the night before, the No. 4 Cardinal showed it did not lack energy.
USC came out strong in the first set, riding a seven-point run to an early 10-4 lead. Stanford responded with a couple of runs of their own and eventually evened the score at 18 apiece. From there, neither team seemed able to pull away until a block from sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers gave USC the first set 28-26.
Stanford responded in the second set with a victory of its own. Led by junior Brian Cook’s six kills, the Cardinal took the set 25-17 to even the match. USC was able to respond in the third set with another stretch of high-intensity play.
It was in this third set that a pair of aces from Rivera gave the Trojans a 15-11 lead and a lot of momentum. The Trojans pulled away after that and took the set 25-18.
Stanford, however, was able to respond once again and, this time, the Trojans could not keep up. Brian Cook added five more kills and helped the Cardinal force the match to a fifth set. He racked up 20 total for the night.
The fifth set proved unlucky for USC, which fell behind early and could not catch up. The Cardinal rode the momentum of the last set to a 15-10 win and their second five-set victory in consecutive nights.
“We played hard. I was proud of the fight,” Ferguson said. “They had a couple serving runs that we had trouble handling in the fourth set but by and large we were playing our tails off against a really good team.”
Once again, USC’s inconsistency from the service line was the main cause of their woes. While they benefitted from short bursts of high power serving, the Trojan’s eight aces were overshadowed by 20 service errors, four of which came in the final set.
“Right now, our team doesn’t do as well serving into a game plan, so we have to start taking more risks from the line,” Ferguson said. “We’re going to miss a few and it’s going to be hard to watch at times but, when the good times come, it’s going to look really good.”
With the loss, USC drops to a disappointing 4-9 record and currently sits one game out of the playoff picture. The Trojans will head to Honolulu to face the University of Hawai’i in two matches next weekend. The team will then return to the Galen Center on Thursday, March 15 to face top-ranked UC Irvine. Earlier this season, the Trojans swept the Anteaters 3-0 tand got its first win of the season.
Thursday is not March 15th, but a Friday. What has become of  proof reading these days. Missing a real top
outside hitter and a second middle blocker with some size and strength. Going from the national title match in
2012 to possibly missing the conf. tourney this year entirely is unacceptable for a good program.  Ferguson
couldn’t win the big match with Murphy Troy and Tony Ciarelli while mediocre recruiting the last four years has
put this team in an awkward position to say the least.

“I have had an opportunity to explore all my interests at USC,” Sugiyama said. “That’s why I came here.”
Sugiyama refuses to let basketball completely define his USC experience. As a true student-athlete, he found a way to balance his desire to gain work experience with his passion for the sport.
Sugiyama has had to make difficult sacrifices to accommodate such large commitments. Prior to his senior year of high school, he forfeited his final season of Amateur Athletic Union basketball to work under Pelosi. Sugiyama said he had scholarship offers from several mid-major programs, yet he saw the value in a USC education and decided to walk on and become a Trojan. Despite interning countless hours at JPMorgan this past summer, he found time to work out regularly and improve his game.
In fact, it is not uncommon to see Sugiyama rolling down Trousdale Parkway on his longboard in a business suit on his way to a class presentation, only to see him a couple of hours later riding back in basketball attire on his way to practice.
“You always have time management issues for the first two or three weeks of the semester as a student-athlete,” Sugiyama said. “After that you adjust, no matter how busy your schedule is. You have to.”
Sugiyama’s contribution to the USC basketball program cannot be found in box scores. The 5-foot-10 senior guard has not scored a point for the Trojans, nor played more than six total minutes in a season.
Yet Sugiyama, who has been a member of the USC basketball team longer than any scholarship player, commands respect. As Sugiyama sat on the couch recounting his USC career in the lounge area of the Galen Center locker room after a recent practice, teammate Eric Wise, just strolling past, joined the conversation to hear what his fellow senior had to say.
“We all trust his opinion,” senior guard Jio Fontan said. “He has become our bench captain.”
During practices, Sugi, as his teammates call him, frequently mentors younger players. The soft-spoken Winnetka, Ill., native provides calming instruction to his peers, which contrasted with former head coach Kevin O’Neill’s abrasive teaching style.
“He knows exactly what we want as a coaching staff,” assistant coach Tony Miller said. “Sometimes the players might think we want something one way, but Sugiyama can pull them aside and show them what we are really trying to get done.”
Sugiyama provides more than just knowledge of the game. In practice, he is regularly tasked with simulating an opponent starting point guard on offense and shadowing USC’s guards on defense.
“He pushes me to get better,” Fontan said. “He does not back down. He is really aggressive on the defensive end, so you have to stay on your toes.”
After graduation, Sugiyama is going professional, but not in basketball. He has a job lined up with financial services firm JPMorgan’s Treasury Services department in New York.
If Sugiyama decides to cross back over into a career in basketball, however, his wide range of experiences with the Trojans should serve him well.
“He is definitely a Wall Street guy but if he wants to pursue coaching, he has a coach’s mindset,” senior forward Renaldo Woolridge noted.
Whatever path he chooses, Sugiyama’s impact on USC’s basketball team cannot be denied. In a season filled with turmoil, he has been a calming force among the seemingly constant change that has afflicted the program. For his part, though, Sugiyama has been able to keep the big picture in perspective.
“Down the road it will not just be about practices and sprints every day,” Sugiyama said. “The hard work is going to be staying late and doing what you need to do to stand out among a group of people.”
Good for him, and best of success in his future endeavor. Like his political thinking. Many , many years ago went to a cousin’s wedding in Winnetka, Illinois way before Sugiyama was born.

Ideally, having a roommate can be a deeply rewarding experience that can lead to lifelong friendships. Realistically, however, having roommates can be stressful, especially when it comes to sharing finances. Sometimes organizing simple domestic tasks, such as splitting rent and utility payments, hashing out any room-usage issues or deciding on room-related purchases, can feel decidedly awkward. It doesn’t need to, though. Founder Luke Langon and a team at Northern California-based zenrow, inc. want roommates at college campuses across America to be able to easily organize and confirm rent and utility payments and communicate room-wide news — digitally.
Digital solutions · Luke Langon introduces zenrow, a product that helps roommates organize and keep track of rent and utility payments online. The user-friendly app is intended to make roommates lives simpler. – Courtesy of Luke Langon
Zenrow is an online application that connects roommates in online hubs or “homebases” where users can divide payments, keep track of who has paid and communicate via private room-specific bulletin boards.
The concept certainly sounds useful in theory, as anyone who has had a not-so-punctual roommate could attest. Langon said the idea for zenrow came out of his own life experience.
“Like most other useful applications, all of us as co-signers had a need for the application,” Langon said. “There’s always that one roommate that doesn’t pay you back until weeks on end. I’m a prompt person, so two of us got together and talked about it. We thought it would be a fun, useful app.”
In an age where verbal communication is becoming less and less common in favor of digital alternatives, the ability to settle payments digitally lends the application a reassuring quickness. Langon said he sought to keep things basic, focusing on creating an intuitive, user-friendly app.
“Our main focus is on simplicity; if you look at the [homebase] page for five to 10 seconds, you immediately understand what we’re doing,” Langon said.
To ensure that the app was easy to use, Langon put the online-version of zenrow through the ultimate tech-literacy stress test: He asked his father to attempt to set up an account and navigate his way around the site without any assistance. His father succeeded.
Michael Kiper, a senior majoring in political science, was particularly thankful for the app’s responsiveness.
“It’s actually fun to use,” Kiper said. “It’s satisfying to be able to settle up with my roommates immediately. Now I’m notified if I owe my roommates anything so I can take care of it right away. [The] best part is I get reimbursed for the bills I pay much faster.”
When it comes to the amount users have to pay, zenrow’s payment calculator splits payments evenly between users to ensure everyone pays only their due.
The site itself, however, is free of charge, including payment transfers. Though users will have to establish a PayPal account or link their existing PayPal account to the site, payments via PayPal are not subject to any convenience fee or commission because Langon was able to secure a peer-to-peer agreement for PayPal wherein users are able to freely transfer funds within their homebases without paying commissions or fees as long as those users are in the United States.
A mobile app of zenrow is currently in the works, and Langon estimated that the app would be ready to go live in the near future, barring any setbacks in development. The mobile version of zenrow would sync with a user’s online homebase and utilize cloud servers to share information.
Theoretically, the mobile version of zenrow would improve upon the online model and make it even more user-friendly and accessible. Some innovations would include the ability to make homebase payments from one’s mobile phone and the ability to receive push notifications for online bulletin board announcements. Langon explained that the latter innovation would be a particularly useful communication tool for college students, who could receive announcements about any circumstances in the room which would bar a peaceful study environment or notify fellow roommates about any housekeeping issues.
When asked who zenrow’s target audience was, Langon made it clear.
“We’re really focusing on making this out to be the most useful app for college students. We’ll be happy to contribute to this community of happier roommates,” Langon said.
Though Langon’s app may not replace that missing slice of pie to the fridge or make returning foreign clothes to their owners any less awkward, when it comes to creating a community of happier roommates, the user-friendly and easy-to-use app might just suffice in preventing disaster.

We’ve all seen the scare-tactic videos that warn people against “out-of-control” rave dances: Grainy footage taken from a small camera hidden in a bag, blurred-out faces of teenagers in an underground cave somewhere in the middle of God-knows-where, doing drugs to the point of death, strobe lights flashing and sex happening right in the middle of the dance floor.
This is what I thought a rave was. You know, a bunch of weird, bored kids listening to weird music doing weird things and, by the looks of their sweat, smelling very weird. Upon moving to Los Angeles, however, I soon found out that those old videos are just plain wrong. Now, I can’t vouch for how raves are in other places — they very well could be just like the ones depicted in those videos. But, the ones out here are quite simply some of the best events that anyone could possibly go to.
I promise I’m not a “raver:” Trust me, I know those people who are professional ravers, who pick out their outfits months in advance, who think that Beyond Wonderland is actually the start of the new year. I am not that person. I am, however, a girl who got hooked on raves for two reasons: The music and, of course, the fashion.
You might have guessed by now that since this is a fashion column, I’m just going to skip over describing how good the music is. But, take my advice: Spend a few minutes downloading some Crookers, Skrillex, Tommy Trash and, my personal favorite, Major Lazer.
More significantly, this Saturday, the farewell tour of Swedish House Mafia comes to Los Angeles State Historic Park. When my mom asked what that meant, I told her it was as if Barry Manilow decided to go on a goodbye tour. Swedish House Mafia is God for a large number of electronic dance music fans, just like Barry Manilow is … whatever he is for middle-aged women.
If you ask around campus, I’d go out on a limb here and say that an insane amount of people are going. This might turn out to be the event of the year. This will be the night that USC students cause Instagram to crash. If you haven’t purchased your ticket yet, don’t worry — there are still some available on Stubhub for a cool $200.
Now you’ve got your ticket and, hopefully, a basic knowledge of the music. So what do you wear? You’ve seen the photos: Sparkly bras, thongs, furry boots, weird-but-awesome panda hats. Remember that line about “professional ravers”? If you see any of the above, then you know who you’re dealing with.
There are two reasons why I don’t wear just a bra to raves. First of all, sh-t gets sweaty. And the last thing I want is to rub up against that random sweaty — and shirtless — guy trying to do the shuffle even though there are literally thousands of people packed up against him. Second of all, I know I don’t have a six-pack, and it should be a general rule that you can’t wear solely a bra and thong in public unless your body resembles that of Kate Upton. Sorry to break it to you, but it’s not a cute look.
Keep the theme in mind, however. HARD Haunted Mansion is always Halloween themed, so you’ll see lots of costumes and Day of the Dead makeup. Swedish House Mafia’s last tour is masquerade-themed, so you can expect to see some pretty cool masks picked up for 99 cents in the fashion district. Gather your friends together and do something as a group.
You also want to make sure that your outfit matches the event in terms of its scale. Escape From Wonderland, held in San Bernadino with haunted mansions, several stages and a laundry list of top-notch DJs? Go all out. Crookers in the small, indoor Santa Ana Observatory? No, you’re not allowed to wear nipple tassels. You don’t want to be that person who’s overdressed — or underdressed. Wearing what you want is fine, but just make sure that the outfit matches the occasion.
The most important thing, however, is to make sure that your outfit is as comfortable as can be. Though neon tanks are apparently all the rage, it should be a general life rule that guys can only wear white or black tanks to raves because, let’s face it, you get sweaty and you don’t want it to show. I’d also stick to jeans: I once saw a guy in a head-to-toe leotard, and I’m sure he regretted it later.
If you’re not one to run to the bedazzled bra section of Victoria’s Secret just for a concert, I suggest a simple uniform of a cute, but comfortable shirt — and one that you don’t mind getting possibly ruined. Closed-toe shoes are also a must: Sure, you might think that sandals are cute, but you won’t when your toenails pop off from someone “accidentally” jumping up and down on them. And make sure that your purse/fanny pack is hands-free. I’d suggest a crossbody type to make it easier to dance. You’re going to be standing for hours — make sure that your clothes are the last thing you’re worrying about.
My sister once asked me why I liked raves, and my response was pretty simple: They always feature a sense of community, of passion, of excitement. Yes, raves are about the music, but let’s be real here: the process of dressing up is just as important. Clothes are an expression of who we are as dance fans and it’s our duty to be as creative as we can be. Have you ever heard of a boring raver?
No? Exactly.
This is your chance to show your true colors. Anything that you’re afraid of in your “everyday” life could be transformative in your nightlife. Even if you decide to go the bra-and-thong route, no one will judge you. Everyone’s there for one reason: to listen to music and to have a great time. No one’s there to hate on you — for once, it’s all about peace, love and happiness.
So take out your best angel wings, find your best frat hat and get ready to party as soon as the beat drops.

Great job Sheridan! You clearly understand the spirit of rave culture. My only comment is that guys shouldn’t be limited to only black or white tanks. I party in all colored tanks and if it gets sweaty I just take it off! No one judges you if you’re sweaty that just means you’re having fun! You should try to stand out at these events and limiting yourself to black or white would be a shame.
Also although I used to only wear jeans to big shows and festivals I converted to shorts about a year ago and never went back. Comfort is key and jeans get hot especially at indoor venues like the Palladium. I think the only required accessory to wear out to a show is a smile. Have fun at SHM!

Uttering the title The Grapes of Wrath would probably elicit groans from many college students, bringing PTSD flashbacks to the days of struggling through the classics in AP English classes. Most classic stories, it seems, have suffered rejection at the hands of young people (millennials, in particular) who are all too willing to slap one label on literature or media with a slower pace: boring.

A new production of John Steinbeck’s masterpiece at Pasadena’s A Noise Within theater, however, might inspire current and former students alike to rummage for their old paperbacks and give the story another look.
Steinbeck’s tour-de-force novel about an American family’s endeavor to survive the Great Depression is given new life  by writer Frank Galati and director Michael Michetti. Galati, who won two Tonys for his production of the same play at Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago in 1990 and received another nomination for directing the musical Ragtime in 1998, has managed to cut together an excellent script that contains all of the key scenes of Steinbeck’s original without getting too jumpy or seeming too abridged.
Galati’s book, paired with Michetti’s masterful command of pacing and blocking, yields a product that has the potential to outdo anything currently on Broadway or the West End.
The story is well-known by now: The Joad family, dirt-poor and living in Oklahoma, packs up their old jalopy and heads west to find employment in California. The 12 members of the Joad clan are joined by their friend Jim Casy, a retired preacher. The course of the play sees their party dwindle considerably; some die, a few run away, but each character leaves a lasting emotional footprint on both the remaining family members and the audience alike.
Since its publication in 1939, The Grapes of Wrath has been the cause for much controversy. Steeped in biblical metaphors and a rather thinly veiled promotion of socialism, the book has been banned in schools and even burned in protest. Though such radical reactions to art are less common nowadays, the key moments in Steinbeck’s piece that offended so many are still likely to raise some goose bumps, if not a few eyebrows. Expect to experience a wide range of emotions as an audience member, as these gifted storytellers elicit much laughter, maybe some tears and even a gasp or two.
The iconic characters of Jim Casy, Tom Joad and Ma Joad are more than done justice by this talented cast. Matt Gottlieb gives Jim an appropriately steady air of wisdom in addition to performing a clear charisma that makes it easy to see him as a Christ figure. Steve Coombs methodically releases and restrains Tom Joad’s notorious temper; he inhabits his character with impressive sagacity.
And as Ma Joad, Deborah Strang reinforces her character’s reputation as one of the most rock-solid and pure-hearted matriarchs in America’s literary canon. Her determination to keep her family afloat and together is evident in every moment of her performance; Strang’s Ma is the definition of fierce (in a lioness way, not a Ru Paul way).
The entire cast, really does a splendid job of illustrating the mindset of both dejection and resilience that Steinbeck’s story explores. There are few, if any, weak links in this company. Since the cast is relatively large at 27 members, the stage feels suitably well-populated at all times, full of “regular folk” doing regular -folk things. Michetti arranges his actors into some gorgeous stage pictures, and the blocking is always dynamic. Further, both the fight choreography and dance sequences are a treat to witness.
Though the costumes are decidedly un-flashy to fit the era, other technical aspects of The Grapes of Wrath keep the production value high. Lighting designer Elizabeth Harper, in her use of warm yellows and cool blues, effectively reflects the temperature of wherever the Joad family travels through; keep an eye out for the jaw-dropping orange and purple gradient of the sunset. Meanwhile, sound designer Robert Oriol incorporates sound effects so seamlessly that it’s sometimes unclear whether they’re real or imagined.
The musicians are a revelation, and save many a scene that might otherwise drag. Playing era-appropriate music on guitars, mandolins and fiddles, they often do double duty as both score and soundtrack, sometimes even standing behind the audience.
For those still wondering if the trek to Pasadena is worth a performance that might ultimately leave some depressed, consider that although The Grapes of Wrath takes place several decades ago, its major themes are still mighty relevant to modern audiences. Like us, the Joads deal with classicism, negotiating the difference between what’s legal and what’s moral, the nature of sin and bridging the gap between “Can we?” and “Will we?”
A Noise Within specializes in re-packaging classic theater in a way that resonates with audiences today. So next time, skip the SparkNotes and catch a classic in all its glory.
 
The Grapes of Wrath runs through May 11.

If the terms “juice cleanse” or “organic fruit smoothie” strikes fear into your heart (and wallet), you are not alone.
Many steer away from this trend because they think it is only accessible to wealthy socialites -— that 1 percent of society who sip their expensive wheatgrass shots in order to shed a pound off their already slim figures.
But, don’t let this stereotype prevent you from going out and buying freshly squeezed juice. A whole world of delicious and nutritious experiences awaits you and, if you don’t believe in the amazing benefits (and tastiness) of juice, it’ll only take one sip from a Juice Crafters creation to change your opinion.
Juice Crafters, a family-run business with locations in Brentwood and the Pacific Palisades, just expanded by opening a new branch in Downtown Los Angeles, finally making its products accessible to those who live near the center of the city.
Owner and manager David Nia calls the store a healthy alternative to fast food.
“I want to give people who are always busy and on the run — between classes, work, interviews, etc. — a better option to energize themselves between their daily activities,” Nia said.
The juice bar is designed so that customers can just walk in, order their beverage and be on their way. Still, don’t let the speed fool you: The cold-press juicer the store uses enables the drinks to have three to six times more vitamins, enzymes and vital nutrients than other juicers.
Nia said his family’s 80-year-old juicing method is able to extract so many nutrients because it utilizes tremendous hydraulic pressures that keeps the juices minimally exposed to heat and air. This creates, according to Nia, the freshest juices on the planet.
Though it is a bold proclamation, when you try one of Juice Crafters’ fresh, organic beverages, the claim feels justified. Unlike some other organic smoothies that mix vegetables and fruits together, the products at this restaurant have no weird aftertaste and don’t resemble green sludge.
The Silver Cup smoothie, for example, is a sweet and satisfying mix of almond milk, coconut water, kale, dates, bananas and walnuts. In addition to its vibrant and appealing color, the smoothie also has all the taste and richness of a fine dessert, just without the excessive sugar or carbs.
Juice Crafters also sells three Complete Whole Body Cleanse plans, which include three-, five- and eight-day juice cleanses all consisting of different combinations of Juice Crafters’ cold-pressed juices. Juice cleanses have come under fire recently as being dangerous for your health and the store rightfully warns beginners against trying anything more than a one- or three-day cleanse, as completely altering your diet in such an extreme way is risky and should only be done under the guidance or recommendation of a certified health professional.
Nia also states that a juice cleanse is not recommended to customers under 18 years of age, and that if a customer, of any age, does elect to go on a cleanse, that it is very important to listen to one’s body and alter one’s diet appropriately — even if that means discontinuing the cleanse.
The restaurant also offers a few options that can serve as a stand-alone meal, including a rich, invigorating and exotic açai bowl. The açai bowl is the perfect option for a harried student, as it contains an energy-boosting combination of açai berry, almond granola, coconut, banana, strawberries and guarana (a Brazilian plant containing double the caffeine of coffee beans).
All of the other orders on the menu appear to be as equally fresh and delicious. Also, every ingredient is fresh and never frozen. The price tag for the juices can be expensive (most smoothies run about $7.50), but Nia said that the cost is necessary to maintain the quality of her products. She is adament about using fresh, quality ingredients.
“I would rather spend money on more employees to cut the fruits and vegetables and prepare fresh product for the customers than on frozen ingredients,” Nia said.
The focus on quality does not end there. The menu is almost entirely vegan (aside from the usage of bee pollen in some of the smoothies) and does not use soy. The bases for the drinks — such as almond milk and coconut water — are all created from scratch at the restaurant itself.
There is no arguing that introducing fresh, healthy and organic food into your everyday diet benefits the health of your body and mind immensely and adds energy into your life. And with spring-cleaning season fast approaching, indulging in Juice Crafters’ all-natural elixirs could be a way to clean up more than just your dorm room.

“Many steer away from this trend because they think it is only accessible to wealthy socialites -— that 1 percent of society who sip their expensive wheatgrass shots in order to shed a pound off their already slim figures.”
Why must everything be turned into the us vs them mentality of the 1% vs 99%? I’m not saying that everyone drinks wheat grass, but its not a rare commodity. I grew up in a modest middle class area, and my friends would get shots of it when we would go to Jamba Juice after school…
I am totally agree with Juices are not only  for  wealthy socialites,anyone can made or buy a fresh healthy natural juice, and yes is a fantastic alternative to fast food!

Department store conglomerate JC Penney made headlines this week but not for a reason that any company would want: The department store chain reported quarterly results that were so shockingly bad, they might have been the worst numbers in retail history.
The reason for the company’s rapid decline is its recent implementation of the revolutionary pricing strategy known as “Fair and Square Every Day.” The brainchild of CEO and former Apple executive Ron Johnson, the strategy was designed to eliminate sales and focus on a rebranding of JC Penney as a quality brand that offered low prices every day.
Ultimately, however, the shift in strategy was detrimental to the company’s core consumer base and a poor decision. For the company to regain its former success and avoid bankruptcy, Johnson will most likely be forced to reevaluate JC Penny’s corporate priorities and company vision.
The once-beloved brand had been struggling for quite some time, but when retail guru Johnson was hired out of Apple’s top executive branch, it seemed that the tide was turning for JC Penney’s company image.
“[Johnson] immediately set about to reorganize the stores, and imported Apple concepts, most notably a ‘no discounting’ policy geared around convincing customers that the everyday price is a great price,” said Matthew Yglesias, a business analyst from Slate.
Yet almost immediately, this strategy proved to be ineffective. Sales dropped a staggering 32 percent, the worst in the company’s 111-year history. Ironically, in order to make up for its loss in inventory, Johnson was forced to take JC Penney back to the tactic that made it popular: sales.
“Since merchandise was not selling, [JC  Penney] had to offer bargain basement clearance prices to move inventory, thus reducing gross margin. Over the last year the best deals in retail have likely been at J.C. Penney’s clearance rack,” wrote Rafi Mohammed of the Harvard Business Review.
Most analysts agree that the mistake in JC Penney’s revamped image was a misunderstanding of its consumer base. By eliminating sales, Johnson’s strategy unintentionally alienated his client bases and changed the company’s core values. Johnson might be a genius, but he’s a genius at building shopping experiences for young, hip, upwardly mobile professionals. JC Penney’s target audience is older, less hip, lower-middle class moms and kids,” writes Derek Thompson of The Atlantic.
Accordingly, one of the key features to JC Penney’s “revamped” image was the inclusion of free Wi-Fi at each of the store locations. While youths and working professionals might appreciate the value of such an addition, parents and lower-income individuals are unlikely to take advantage of such a feature.
“Instead of building on what the people who like JCPenney liked about JCPenney, he undertook a series of essentially arbitrary changes that alienated some without drawing anyone new in,” Yglesias argued.
Such a change is uncommon and unnecessary in retail locations and outlets in the industry. As Yglesias noted,  “Macy’s surprised analysts on Tuesday with a 3.9 percent increase in same-store sales. It’s not the coolest company around, they’re not reinventing the retail experience, and there’s no Wi-Fi. But it seems to be working.”
The only thing left to analyze is what approach the company will employ as it heads into another tough economic climate. Many predict the company will be forced to consider bankruptcy. “Either it further revises its pricing strategy to include sales on national brands or it heads to bankruptcy court,” Mohammed wrote.
Still, others expressed hope that the company might be able to recover. “We’ll know by the end of this year,” said activist hedge fund worker Bill Ackman. “The company won’t pour billions into a strategy that’s not working.”
No matter what the future of JC Penney turns out to be, one thing is certain: the company desperately needs to reevaluate their corporate vision and priorities, perhaps now more than ever. The elimination of sales, a major mainstay of the brand, was a risky decision at best and was the opposite image of the company’s core clientele.
In order to stage a truly effective comeback, JC Penney will need to rebuild the company image in the same light as its consumers and go back to the roots of what rendered it a success. Based on their recent financial history, it seems as though JC Penney will definitely have a sale in the near future.

It might be a mistake to pull the plugs on the new corporate policy in place at JCpenny. I am an avid retailer with over $4000 in clothing merchandise purchase in 2012. Interestingly enough I never felt that JCPenny would offer anything of interest. Through word of mouth and to my surprise I was blown away by the wonderful selection and competitive prices. Obviously, it does take a while for such drastic changes in the structure of an organization to take hold. I for one believe it is a positve move. The strategy may still need to be fine tuned but it has so far set JCPenny appart from other retailers. Sad to say that Macy’s might have lost a loyal customer….

As talk of the sequestration grew louder and louder in the United States, a less gripping but far more fundamental issue at the heart of American society was quietly being resolved on Capitol Hill.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
After expiring in 2011, the Violence Against Women Act  was reauthorized by both the House of Representatives and the Senate and will go onto President Barack Obama’s desk, where the president will happily sign it into law. The renewal also carries with it a reinstatement of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which provides essential medical services to victims of human trafficking.
The only opposition to the bill came from 138 Republican congressmen and 22 Republican senators, well over half of the party’s elected presence on Capitol Hill. For them, concerns over new provisions expanding protection to the LGBT community and immigrants overruled the need to better help women and victims of the sex trade needing redress and comfort when faced with domestic violence or sexual crimes.
The idea that VAWA sat for more than a year is sign enough of a dysfunctional government, but that’s not quite the heart of the issue.
Though lack of support for same-sex marriage and illegal immigrants within the GOP is not new or surprising, the battle over VAWA reveals a party in deep political trouble because of its outdated views on social equality.
Initially signed into law in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act is a landmark piece of legislation that improves the criminal justice response to violence against women and improves victims’ access to services to both feel safe and rebuild their lives. Since the bill’s passage, intimate partner violence has declined 67 percent, and the rate of intimate partner homicide for females has declined by 35 percent, according to the White House’s official website. Every woman in the Senate voted to reauthorize VAWA, and it is unconscionable that GOP objections to the extension of the law to the LGBT community blocked the law from being reauthorized when it expired in October 2011.
Attitudes like these are not forgotten by voters, especially those that are most affected by the law. Obama’s victory over Gov. Mitt Romney with 55 percent of the female vote in the 2012 election is proof enough of that.
Not to be deterred, some members of the GOP demonstrated awareness of their lack of support from women, but simultaneously demonstrated their ignorance over equally important groups, such as homosexual and transgender people.
Though 87 of the GOP’s more enlightened representatives supported the final version of the House bill, the majority of the party opted to first hold a vote on the GOP’s version of the bill, which stripped all references to “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” when it came to classifying groups who qualify as underserved communities, essentially making them ineligible to receive those services.
Not only did the measure fail, but its failure reveals a sick sense of priority within the GOP, which is apparently willing to continue denying services to victims of domestic violence and human trafficking to make a statement about the party’s refusal to support gay and transgender rights. It’s further evidence that some members of the Republican Party view politics as a game and are largely blind to the impact their decisions have on real people.
The alternate version that Speaker of the House John Boehner allowed to come to a vote is additionally preposterous, because it appears to be a political move that allowed those republicans who didn’t vote for the final bill to say that they supported a version of it. Boehner must have known that the alternate version didn’t have a chance of passing, but he allowed it to come to a vote anyway, at best just wasting time and at worst providing a cover for those who didn’t want the original version to pass.
Consider republican Congressman Steve King, who voted for the alternate bill (not the bill that became law), and posted the following misleading quote to his website: “Today I voted in support of the House version to see that victims of domestic violence and sexual assault have access to the resources and protection when they need it the most.”
Something we can be sure King will not follow up with is an explanation that the very version he voted for did not become law and was even rejected by some members of his own party.
It’s time for the Republican Party to start seeing the forest for the trees when it comes to important legislation such as VAWA, regardless of small disagreements with the bill’s language. Playing political games with essential services for victims of crimes is no way to represent constituents. Fiddling thumbs while denying services to the LGBT community does not bode well for the future, and the 87 republicans who voted in support of the final version should be commended.
If only the rest of the GOP would follow their lead.

Mr. Haas your opinion is biased and broadly insensitive. Remember California Prop 8 was turned down by a predominately Democrat state. Does that infer that the voters are insensitive? You ignore religious and cultural beliefs in your assessments. The GOP is no more insensitive than anyone else. Without digressing to common arguments, because the Republican Party represents a more conservative viewpoint, which includes a pro-life platform, a more adherance to more American beliefs such as religious freedoms, and a fiscal conservativism that wants to keep the country strong doesn’t mean they are insensitive. 
Don’t color your opinions with the party line dusted by the biased media, make an effort to understand why these so-called insensitive Republicans make their arguments. Voting results are not black or white, and saying because Mr. Romney lost amongst a particular voter sector is proof. Any responsible argument requires more in-depth research not some popularity contest results. It seems your generation never took to heart an old 60’s saying….”question everything.”
Rich,
Thank you for your comments. On face, I’m not quite sure how applicable they are to my article. The broader point is that half of the majority party in the House of Representatives voted against a bill that would provide essential services to victims of domestic violence. Asserting that the GOP is “no more insensitive than anyone else” doesn’t contradict that, nor make it okay. I’m also not sure how Republican policies on abortion, religious freedom and fiscal conservatism prove that the Republican Party’s actions were, in this instance, out of line and hurtful to women. 
Your example about Prop 8, while a good point, is reflective of the broader argument made by my article. Though California voters, who are indeed democratic, passed Prop 8 in 2008, it is clear that the Democratic Party’s stance on gay rights has evolved significantly more than their counterparts. I think Obama’s endorsement of gay marriage is a good example. 
Voting results are most certainly black and white. Someone either votes for you, or they don’t. Unfortunately, the fact still remains that Governor Romney lost the female vote by a significant margin. Sure it’s a popularity contest, but why was President Obama so much more “popular” than Governor Romney in the eyes of female voters? It surely wasn’t a coincidence. Your closing advice is quite appropriate- I questioned why female voters so strongly preferred President Obama, and concluded that the answer is that large numbers of the GOP do not vote for policies like the Violence Against Women Act.
Please help
Please help stop the approx $30 million a year in Unconstitutional payments from L.A. County to the State Employed judges. Stop the bias created by the bribes in favor of L.A. County against the tax payers?
Judges validate the integrity of elections. The judges have received AMNESTY from prosecution for accepting money that was not authorized by LAW. The entire system has been corrupted.
Please help stop the waste and fraud and restore integrity to the courts.
LA County takes tax payer money then bribes the judges so they rule in favor of the County against the tax payers.
