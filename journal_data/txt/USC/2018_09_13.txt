Annenberg Media Center Director Christina Bellantoni and professor Miki Turner, both former journalists, sat down Thursday for a conversation with Cindi Leive, the former editor-in-chief of Glamour and Self magazines and a senior fellow at Annenberg. 
With Leive’s decades of experience speaking about women and media, much of the conversation dealt with navigating the complexities of being a working woman, delving specifically into the relationship between domestic and work life. Leive detailed her personal experience as a mother and as a professional and the immense expectations that accompany these roles. 
Recognizing that her maternity leave was longer than the national average, which she called “pitifully insufficient,” Lieve discussed the difficulty of juggling two roles.  
“I complained a lot about it to my husband and my friends,” Leive said. “But I never actually took it to my company … I felt like on some level I was lucky to have this position, and I don’t think that’s something a man in the same position would think.”
Bellantoni also remarked on the challenges facing working women who want to start a family. She said she has witnessed women reluctant to defend their interests, opting instead to work overtime or sacrifice aspects of their personal or professional lives.
“I’ve had people say ‘I don’t want to ask about maternity leave policy when searching for a job because I don’t want you to think I’m just going to get pregnant right away,’” Bellantoni said. “First of all, you can do whatever you want … and secondly, it’s important for you to have this information.”
Leive tied these challenges facing women back to the media by analyzing how language pigeonholes and undermines professional women, especially those in the public eye.
“A lot of the most basic, egregious, bits of sexism that reporters use to exhibit women candidates like asking … ‘How are you going to do this job andif you have kids?’” Leive said. 
This discussion provoked a question from Parker Susolik, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law. Referring to questions of whether a female candidate is fit to hold office if she has children, Susolik asked, “How come that can’t be seen as an actual, pointed question?”
Graduate business student Alexandra Pinckney said that such a question, while it appears logical, targets women specifically.
“The problem is female candidates are asked [how they can do the job if they have a child] when their children are … out of the infancy stages, where either parent should be equally involved,” Pinckney said. “She also added that such a question invalidates women as equally competent and, in the case of female politicians, ‘detracts from the focus of the campaign.’” 
Remi Riordan, a sophomore majoring in journalism, also offered her remarks on the challenges facing working women. She discussed the idea of holistically reevaluating the way our society splits professional and personal life, suggesting that giving people more personal freedom does not hinder their ability to be effective workers.
“The whole idea relies so much on biology, and, first of all, not all women want to have children, and so many men nowadays want paternity leave,” Riordan said. “In the talk, they were saying how people do better when they’re given more time to spend with their families. Even now some jobs are cutting their work weeks down … and saying that performance has gone up.”

The Board (above) held a “student leaders” listening session on Wednesday. Thursday was the first of three public listening sessions where faculty, staff and students are asked to voice their concerns regarding the search process for USC’s next president. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The first public Presidential Search Advisory Committee listening session was held in the Town & Gown ballroom on Thursday. It featured an open platform for faculty, staff and students to voice their concerns regarding the search for USC’s next president. 
The session began with an introduction from Rick Caruso, chairman of the USC Board of Trustees. Caruso expanded on the five phases of the presidential search process, which includes the listening sessions, background checks and confidential interviews with the committee. Caruso explained that they will “take the time [they] need to get it right,” estimating that the search for a new leader will take from three to six months. 
During the open session, Gail Freedman, a Student Services advisor with enrollment services, delivered a powerful message that received loud applause from the crowd. 
“I just feel that in the past eight years, we were so busy building our empire that we forgot to put the most important people first,” Freedman said. “We have a beautiful campus full of beautiful exteriors, but we’ve lost our integrity, our honor, and our soul … I want an ethical problem-solver: someone who meets the challenges head on, and does not try to sweep unpleasantries under the carpet.”
Another speaker, who did not introduce themself, noted that while the superficial image of the University is important, the value of its substance should be a priority. 
“We have been willing to sacrifice our substance to protect that image rather than allowing our commitment to our substance to drive that image,” the speaker said. “We did not create an outreach program for the victims of George Tyndall until a year after we fired him, because the L.A. Times was about to run an article on it. How does that makes us look?”
Others voiced concerns on job security and the lack of transparency from the Board.
Caroline Donat, a junior majoring in law, history and culture, expressed her embarrassment to be a student at the University and argued for the institution to focus less on money and its national reputation. Donat commented on the “ill-planned” forum for scheduling the session at the same time the Career Fair was held on campus, which resulted in fewer student voices. 
Donat also said that while emails about the available support systems are sent to students, the service is extremely limited in terms of location and number of therapy sessions. 
“I would hope that [USC] becomes a place of diversity, that we actually support our community members, especially our staff and students so that people have their mental health taken care of,” Donat said. “There is a lot that needs to be done.”
Following Donat, Professor Richard Roberts, chair of the  Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, asked for more communication and transparency between the faculty and the Board, as well as for the new president to come in with “an attitude of servant leadership.” He also criticized former president C. L. Max Nikias for only communicating with the Board of Trustees.
“He asked you for things that he wanted to do, he did not ask us,” Roberts said. “I’m not sure if the Board of Trustees is even aware, but most of us, who are in the administration are communicated that we are not actually allowed to talk to you directly. That’s a problem. Can you see that that’s a problem?” 
Faculty members were not the only ones who felt there was a lack of communication. Jesenia Rosales, a second-year graduate student at the Rossier School of Education, described emotionally how the construction of USC Village had removed a part of her family’s history without asking for input. 
“That’s something I want the president to have: more connections with the community directly, not just, ‘Oh, we’re going to construct this and that, and kick out people,’” Rosales said. “It should be more of a consensus between both, because it’s everyone’s community in a way.”
Victor Webb, a retired faculty member from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has been at USC for 30 years. Webb urged the Board to find a president who has “a heart and a soul to solve issues that are here.”
“There’s a tremendous air of elitism and arrogance that conveys this University,” Webb said. “There’s no way to deny it. I would suggest that you look at a person who has heart. We have here a distance between the folks who work here and the folks who supposedly rule the place.”
USC Media Relations did not permit notetaking, and the Daily Trojan reporter was told that they could not take down notes or quotes despite the session being a public forum.

USG President Debbie Lee and Vice President Blake Ackerman said University leaders must earn back student trust. (Daily Trojan file photo)
Following the first public Presidential Search Advisory Committee Forum on Thursday, the Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government released a joint statement to the USC community criticizing the lack of student representation in the presidential search process. 
Even before C. L. Max Nikias agreed to step down as president, USG and GSG wrote that they continuously made an effort to reach out to the Board of Trustees to incorporate student representation within decision-making bodies. The student groups had specifically requested two student seats — one for undergraduate and another for graduate — on the Presidential Search Advisory Committee. 
The statement argues that students must be included in the search because they will be greatly affected by the decision. Students have a vested interest in the leadership as they are the University’s “reason for existence,” the statement read.
“Excluding students on the committee is not only a disservice to the very individuals the University failed to protect, but also a failure to provide students an opportunity to advocate for presidential candidates who will strive to protect students to the best of their ability,” wrote USG and GSG.
The statement details USG and GSG’s multiple attempts to have student representation on the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, a process they said had begun in May. 
According to the statement, after USG and GSG reached out multiple times to schedule meetings with Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso and Interim President Wanda Austin, they were invited to Caruso’s home in Brentwood for a meeting on Sept. 4 and met with Caruso again on Sept. 10 to further advocate for student representation. 
According to the statement, Caruso said that despite all of the recent scandals the University has faced, students should take a “measured leap of faith” to trust the Board in regards to the decisions being made, which the Daily Trojan could not independently confirm.
USG President Debbie Lee said  that students cannot place their faith or trust in an administration that has repeatedly failed them.
“I think before asking students to take a ‘leap of faith’ or to continue trusting in administration, you [have] got to give us reasons to do so,” Lee said. “I don’t think there have been tangible reasons to do so for awhile.”
In an email obtained by the Daily Trojan, Caruso responded to Lee about the statement before it was released to the public. Caruso wrote that he and Lee are in agreement that student voices are a “critical component” of the presidential search process.
“Your voices are not being ignored,” Caruso wrote. “[On] the contrary, for the first time in the Board’s recent history, I started an open-door policy to meet with student government leaders on a regular basis and to make sure that any student can contact me via email with questions, suggestions, or concerns.”
Caruso said that the Board is seeking student government counsel on the Special Committee on Governance’s board reform efforts, in addition to establishing a special student leaders’ subcommittee that would meet with the Search Advisory Committee.
In the statement, GSG and USG wrote that students would still have no part in the “substantive discussion that establish the criteria” or have the ability to review and interview candidates. 
USG and GSG wrote that based on the information they have gathered, students will not have the opportunity to meet with candidates throughout the search process. 
“Without any firsthand student interaction, this incoming president might be left with the lasting impression that engagement with students is neither a priority, nor a necessity,” the statement read.

Showtime series “Queer as Folk” aired from 2000 to 2005. The series, starring Gale Harold, Scott Lowell, Peter Paige and Hal Sparks, follows a group of friends navigating adulthood. (Photo from IMDb)
I often imagine the possibility of a TV series documenting the daily lives of gay people. Wouldn’t it be fascinating to watch a drama about guys using Grindr, meeting strangers in WeHo nightclubs or simply navigating their queer identities in 2018? Don’t get me wrong — I absolutely adore Kurt and Blaine, Ian and Mickey, Cameron and Mitchell, among other same-sex couples on primetime TV. But what about a show solely focused on LGBTQ+ characters?
While shows like “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and “Queer Eye” have made strides in highlighting queer culture and identity on the small screen during their respective runs, there is not yet a modern series specifically dedicated to the personal narratives of queer life. HBO’s “Looking” came out in 2014, but it lacked the zest to make an impact on pop culture. But rewind to 2000, when Showtime premiered its groundbreaking drama “Queer as Folk.” With its historic five-year run, the show boldly revolutionized the portrayal of LGBTQ+ individuals in American media. Now that’s a game changer. 
I was first exposed to the series when I was 6 years old, after accidentally stumbling upon my brother watching a raunchy sex scene between two men from the show. Scarred as I was, that may have been the moment I learned what being gay meant — and look where I am now. Sixteen years later, on the first day of Pride Month, I decided to revisit the show and binge its entirety on Netflix — a decision that has come to deeply alter my perception of the queer community. 
Set in Pittsburgh, “Queer as Folk” follows the lives of five gay men and a lesbian couple. Complex, nuanced and deeply captivating, Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman did not hold back when they recreated Russell T. Davies’ British series of the same name. 
Protagonist Michael Novotny delivers this exact line to open the series: “The first thing you have to know is it’s all about sex.” And to a certain extent, he’s right. In the pilot, viewers are introduced to 17-year-old Justin Taylor, who loses his virginity to ad executive Brian Kinney — all within a span of 50 minutes. This was the first of many more explicit gay and lesbian sex scenes featured on the show. While HBO’s “Sex and the City” first aimed to normalize the previously taboo subject of sex when it came out in 1998, “Queer as Folk” pushed the boundaries even further by shedding light on same-sex relationships. 
Provocative, daring and unapologetic, the Showtime series tackled a variety of real-life issues that were deemed too controversial and edgy for mainstream audiences at the time. It destigmatized HIV/AIDS with characters like Vic Grassi and Ben Bruckner. It provided newfound insight into drug  abuse issues within the queer community. It highlighted the importance of fighting homophobia and for LGBTQ+ activism. It provided a snapshot of queer life in the early 2000s, as well as the problems facing the community. Most importantly, “Queer as Folk” did what no other show could at the time — it humanized an entire population that had been previously underrepresented and typecasted across all media. 
That is not to say “Queer as Folk” did not have its faults. First, the show lacked diversity, as most of its main cast was white. While the characters’ racial identities did not necessarily detract from the storytelling, the reality is that the LGBTQ+ community is much more diverse, with different issues and perspectives facing each segment of the population. This flaw made me question whether or not I fit into the dominantly white narrative as a person of color. Moreover, the show fed into toxic stereotypes of hypermasculinity and sexual hierarchies among gay people at times, whether intentional or not. 
Despite its shortcomings, “Queer as Folk” is still a seminal work in LGBTQ+ media. Over the course of half a decade, the series broke barriers when it came to displaying same-sex romance and sex, and had a full cast of dynamic characters when most other queer characters were stereotyped and staticized by mainstream showrunners. Even at its most provocative, “Queer as Folk” teaches its viewers what media representation can be — and the show was unafraid and brave enough to bare it all (literally) for its audiences. 
After watching the show as a 21-year-old man, I was reminded that my story, as well as the stories of so many others, can still be told. In all its glory, “Queer as Folk” was a multi-faceted exploration — and deep dive — into LGBTQ+ identity and culture. To show gay sex was one thing, but to explore so many other real-life topics like infidelity, addiction, romance and careers? “Queer as Folk” was way ahead of its time and 13 years after its conclusion, its stories remain relevant and reflective of the issues queer individuals (young or old) experience.
If this show has taught me anything, it’s that 2018 needs to do some catching up of its own — and that I must further engage in issues affecting my community, continue the fight for diverse representation, and of course, be unapologetically queer.

On select nights from Sept. 14 through Nov. 3, fans of “Stranger Things” and horror houses alike can enjoy Universal Studios Hollywood’s brand-new maze based on the hit Netflix show. (Photo courtesy of NBCUniversal)
Behind the doors of Universal Studios Hollywood’s Stage 29 — what used to be the filming studio for the lighthearted game show “Family Feud” — lies something slightly darker in preparation for the upcoming Halloween season. 
Universal Studios Hollywood is fervently preparing for one of the theme park’s most popular events of the year: Halloween Horror Nights. On select nights from Sept. 14 through Nov. 3, park visitors can venture through eight horrific mazes, with this year’s headlining maze inspired by the Emmy Award-winning Netflix show “Stranger Things.” 
The Daily Trojan was able to capture a behind-the-scenes look at the main attraction, and even with construction still underway, Universal is gearing up for a promising season.
The “Stranger Things”-themed maze physically navigates participants through season one of the show, starting with Will’s abduction and ending with Eleven’s conquering of the Demogorgon. From walking past Christmas lights adorning the Byers’ house to taking a portal through the Upside Down, the maze pays acute attention to detail in recreating a lifelike experience that places visitors right in the middle of the “Stranger Things” universe.
Creative Director John Murdy is the true mastermind behind intricate components of production that bring in guests from all around to celebrate the spooky season. Murdy said he has been a fan of horror since childhood.
At a young age, Murdy was known for flipping his home into a haunted house and helping plan “haunts” in his local community. He studied theater in college, which eventually landed him a tour guide position at Universal Studios Hollywood in 1989, an experience he cites as a stepping stone into the entertainment industry. 
This opportunity allowed him access to the production of “Back to the Future 2” and a place as a production assistant for Universal’s “E.T.” ride, which was later replaced by the “Revenge of the Mummy” ride. In 2006, Murdy returned to his horror roots by resurrecting Halloween Horror Nights, which had been on hiatus for a few years prior.
“It’s weird to end up doing what you were doing at 10 for a career,” Murdy said with a laugh.
Now, Horror Nights is a Universal Studios Hollywood staple event that continues to grow every year. When “Stranger Things” premiered in 2016, Murdy immediately recognized the show’s potential for adaptation and began writing the script for the show’s maze in November 2017. 
“[Creating Horror Nights] is like producing eight movies at the same time,” Murdy said of the elements that go into producing such grand attractions. For developing projects composed of multiple episodes, such as the “Stranger Things” maze, Murdy said it took him about eight hours to go through each episode and determine what details would make it into the maze.
With so much demand on Twitter for the addition of “Stranger Things” to Horror Nights, Murdy fully plans on delivering an experience that visitors won’t forget. In fact, just when participants think the maze and the scares are over, Murdy has another trick up his sleeve.
“[Once they think the maze is over], they let their guard down. We realized that’s the perfect time to scare them,” said Murdy, who plans to surprise guests with two more Demogorgons to round out the fun.
Murdy recognizes that not everyone is a fan of horror. Nonetheless, he encourages those interested to face their fears. 
“It’s like when you’re a kid and you’re looking at that rollercoaster you really want to ride, but you’re terrified of,” Murdy said. “It’s that same kind of right of passage. You’re sitting there like, ‘I don’t know if I can do this,’ but once you do, you fall in love with it.”
Other mazes featured at Horror Nights include those inspired by the classic horror film “Poltergeist” (a maze where Murdy’s 5-year-old daughter plays the voice of Carol Anne), AMC’s “The Walking Dead,” an amalgam of classic horror characters in “Universal Monsters” and many more.

Three weeks ago, my colleague Keith Demolder wrote a column titled, “Fans should care about the better ’SC football.” In his piece, he focused on how fans are sleeping on USC women’s soccer and that McAlister Field doesn’t see nearly as many fans as it should. While Keith’s column focused solely on women’s soccer, I believe most USC sports do not get the attendance and recognition they deserve. 
It’s no question that football is the most watched, anticipated and appreciated sport at USC. We are a football school, after all. The purpose of this column is to not say that USC fans should stop caring about football, but rather that they should also recognize and appreciate the efforts of the other sports. 
The most anticipated sports of fall (besides football) include women’s volleyball, women’s soccer and men’s water polo. Yet, the average USC fan does not attend these teams’ matches, and therefore are unaware of their accomplishments and dominance in their respective sport. 
Men’s Water Polo
With nine national titles to its name, it’s no doubt that USC men’s water polo is consistently a solid team. The Trojans are led by head coach Jovan Vavic, who also coaches the women’s team. Between his two squads, Vavic has 17 national championships — an unrivaled feat in NCAA history. 
The program has only had two losing records in its history (1989 and 1991). In recent years, the team’s record has been nearly perfect each year. This allows the team to be a title contender each season. The Trojans are coming off a 2017 season that ended in a championship loss to UCLA. One of the team’s biggest issues has been closing out seasons. The past four seasons have left the Trojans as a runner-up in the NCAA championship. Regardless, this team will be a championship team and I feel like it’s tough to lose five championships in a row. 
Since USC is such a diverse school, I imagine that a significant portion of students come from places where water polo isn’t a popular sport and have never watched a water polo match. Last year I was one of those students. If you have never seen a game, I strongly urge you to attend or watch a game this fall. It’s a fast-paced, strategic and engaging competition.
Women’s Volleyball
USC women’s volleyball welcomes back several key returners by the likes of senior libero Victoria Garrick and junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier. Last season the girls were knocked out in the fourth round of regionals. This team is another one of those USC teams that is just consistently good year in, year out. 
A lot of the team’s success has been due to the leadership of former head coach Mick Haley. At the end of the 2017 season Haley was fired from USC. His departure came as a shock to volleyball fans as his USC tenure was relatively successful, which saw five national championship appearances from USC. 
Former University of Portland coach Brent Crouch is at the helm of the Trojan team this season. Crouch’s history of reviving teams doesn’t necessarily fit the job description for USC volleyball, but it will be interesting to see what he focuses on. The team has already notched some key wins over powerful schools like Kentucky and Florida.
Women’s Soccer
If you had to choose one of these three teams to watch this season, choose the women’s soccer team. Still fresh off a 2016 national title and coming off the back of two .800 seasons, this team is a championship contender. In 2018, they have both brought back and welcomed a slew of talent. This team is solid front to back and left to right. The program boasts a roster that includes four U-20 national players in forwards freshman Penelope Hocking, sophomore Tara McKeown, redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo and freshman defender Ashley Soto.
But women’s soccer isn’t just a good team, they are also a fun team. That comes from the philosophy of the team’s head coach Keidane McAlpine. The team’s motto this year is “trUSt.” It places an emphasis on the intra-team relationships, which ultimately helps the women play so dynamically and consistently rout teams. 
Within their first seven games of the season, the Trojans have outscored their opponents 24-3. This team has the talent, willpower and ability to win a title this year.
The three aforementioned teams are each exciting in their own ways. One thing they all share in common is that they are championship contending teams, something USC football unfortunately is not. I’m not insinuating that you can’t call yourself a USC fan if you only watch football, but I am saying that these teams are exciting and that fans and students should watch out for them to make playoff runs this season.

After a defeat on the road to Stanford, the Trojans come into this week as the 22nd-ranked team in the nation, down eight spots from last week. They’ll match up Saturday night with a Texas team also struggling to find its footing under second-year head coach Tom Herman, coming off of a week one loss to unranked Maryland and a close win against unranked Tulsa. 
Last year’s contest between the two teams — the first since Texas’ victory in the 2006 Rose Bowl — was a double- overtime thriller in the Coliseum. On Thursday, USC held its final practice  before traveling to Texas. 
USC Offense vs. Texas Defense
The Trojan offense sputtered last week as it only managed to put up 3 points — USC’s first game without a touchdown since its big loss Alabama two years ago in Dallas. The Texas pass rush should provide a nice change of pace for the Trojan offensive line, which struggled mightily in pass protection against Stanford, giving up four sacks and four hurries on the night against an undersized Cardinal front seven. 
“The major concern is the protection for some pressure,” head coach Clay Helton said. “[We don’t have] any scouting report because each and every week is unique and different, so we’re going to have to do a great job of communication as a staff, without kids, about what’s going on within game. Sit down, draw it up and be able to diagnose and get them on the right peak.”
Texas only has one sack after its first two games — as poorly as it looked in pass blocking last week, this game should offer the offensive line a chance to bounce back. The run blocking for USC should be even less of a problem, as the Trojans imposed their will against the Cardinal for much of the game. Sophomore Stephen Carr, senior Aca’Cedric Ware and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai should have an opportunity to run wild over a Longhorns defense which gave up 189 yards to Tulsa last week. 
“I … feel like it’s their pass rushers and their pressures against our offensive line,” Helton said. “Going back and watching last year’s film, [we saw] how many times that [former USC quarterback Sam Darnold] was off his spot. What I mean by that is instead of that nice rhythm … he was forced to get off his spot and move and have to create. I’m hoping to keep that pocket integrity to be able to have a young quarterback … diagnose and see that coverage.”
Freshman quarterback JT Daniels and the performance of the passing offense remain the biggest wildcards on offense for the Trojans this week. After his impressive opening day performance against UNLV, Daniels struggled against the Cardinal as he ran for his life much of the night, completing less than half of his passing attempts. Although veteran receivers redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and junior Michael Pittman performed well, the Trojans need to get freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown more involved in their passing attack. St. Brown has repeatedly shown that he’s one of the most dynamic players on the team, and USC will look to get him the ball more often than it did against Stanford. 
Texas’ secondary is probably the biggest strength of its defense — the athleticism of the group is obvious. The coaches will have to maximize opportunities for Daniels by creating well designed plays for his best targets, which they struggled with last week.
Texas Offense vs. USC Defense
Despite the loss, the USC defense was impressive across the board last week as it held an explosive Stanford offense to only 17 points and 342 yards. The secondary was especially impressive, limiting junior quarterback KJ Costello to 183 yards on the night, and holding senior receiver JJ Arcega-Whiteside to 63 yards after his outburst of more than 200 yards the week before. Texas’ passing offense has some firepower, led by sophomore quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who walked into the Coliseum and put on a show in last year’s matchup. Ehlinger had a bit of a rough start to his season against Maryland in the opener, but bounced back against Tulsa, completing over 70 percent of his passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns. 
Junior receivers Lil’Jordan Humphrey and Colin Johnson are both tough matchups as the Trojans have previously seen, as Johnson dominated against them last year with seven receptions for 191 yards. The USC secondary appears to be more impressive than last year’s unit, with senior veterans Marvell Tell III and Iman Marshall playing at a high level. The loss of redshirt freshman starting safety Isaiah Pola-Mao for the year could prove to be a defensive vulnerability, as it brings USC down to it’s third starter at the position. 
Redshirt sophomore CJ Pollard and freshman Talanoa Hufanga, who both played heavy snaps last week after Pola-Mao went down, will compete for plays at the safety position. 
“I think our team is in very good condition, but we do plan on playing a lot of guys,” Helton said. “We’ve talked about that as a staff … taking the same approach we did with UNLV. [We will be] able to roll guys in waves when given the opportunity with substitution.”
The performance of the Trojan front seven has been a mixed bag so far, with impressive play from the interior linemen and linebackers while the edge defenders have struggled in playing both the run and pass. The edge defenders — comprising senior Porter Gustin, junior Jordan Iosefa and redshirt junior Christian Rector — have struggled in setting the edge on run plays, allowing for explosive rushing gains outside the tackles, as evidenced by senior running back Bryce Love who gained nearly the entirety of his 136 yards from such runs. 
Texas’ rushing attack has been impressive to this point, averaging nearly 200 yards on the ground through two games, led by backs graduate student Tre Watson and freshman Keaontay Ingram. Ehlinger himself has proven a threat when he takes off, having rushed for 81 yards so far — a problem for a USC defense that gave up over 80 yards to sophomore quarterback Armani Rogers of UNLV in week one. 
“[Communication between players] is a big part of it anytime you go out on the road, especially in a hostile environment,” Helton said. “I imagine Texas is going to be even louder than Stanford — bigger stadium, a night game, a big game for both universities.”

The No. 4 USC women’s soccer team took home two impressive wins at home this past weekend after defeating Missouri and San Diego 2-0 and 3-2, respectively. The Trojans move to a record of 6-0-1 and continue their undefeated streak as they advance into their last game before the end of non-conference play on Friday. 
The Trojans had a slow start to their game against Missouri, missing several good looks on goal. Sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo came through in the 27th minute with an in-stride shot to the far post off an assist from sophomore forward Tara McKeown, securing her fourth goal of the season. Junior midfielder Jalen Woodward scored USC’s second goal, and her first career goal, on a shot to the corner that dipped just under the post after ricocheting off a Tiger defender. Redshirt sophomore goalie Kaylie Collins left this game with her fourth solo shutout of the year, after only having to make one save in the game. The Trojans outshot the Tigers 31-4 and brought their goal differential up 17-1, the best start to a season in USC women’s soccer program history.  
Sunday’s game against the Toreros was the first time the Trojans have trailed all season and the first time USC has given up multiple goals in one game. The Toreros scored both of their goals in the first half, each one followed by a Trojan goal. The Trojans’ first goal was from junior forward Natalie Jacobs who scored her third goal of the season with a header off of a cross kick from McKeown in the 22nd minute. A long shot past the goalie from senior defender Ally Prisock allowed freshman forward Penelope Hocking to bury a shot in to the wide-open net in the 35th minute, leaving the score 2-2 at the half. After a challenging first half, the Trojans didn’t hesitate to take control in the second half, dominating position and allowing only one shot on goal from the Toreros. Senior forward Leah Pruitt secured the Trojans’ 3-2 win with a shot inside the far post three minutes into the second half.
With the Toreros goal in the 11th minute, the first scored against the team since the Cal Poly game on Aug. 24 snapped their scoreless streak of 441 minutes. The Trojans are looking to add another win to their undefeated season and restore their scoreless streak when they take on Long Beach State (4-3-0) on Friday.
Long Beach dominated in its last game against St. John’s University, beating them 6-0 in a shutout victory last Friday at home. Jumping into an early lead with junior midfielder Taylor Bistline’s goal in the third minute, the 49ers came out strong and maintained that energy throughout both halves of the game. Two more goals in the first half, one rainbow over the Red Storm keeper and 3 more goals in the second half settled the 49ers into their 6-0 win. The 49ers finished the game with 21 shots and nine on goal, as four different players saw their first goals of the season. With a 3-0 lead heading into the second half, 23 players got onto the field before the game was over, as head coach Mauricio Ingrassia turned to his bench to secure the win. Goalies senior Imani McDonald and junior Riana Castaneda had a combined nine saves for the 49ers in their third shutout game of the season.
“[Long Beach] always, from a tactical standpoint make[s] it difficult to play, difficult to find ways to get in,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine. “Next week will be no different [from San Diego], so we look forward to it.” 
McAlpine is hoping that going into Friday, the Trojans will be able to come out strong and drive the tempo of the game. With Collins earning Pac-12 Goalie of the Week and five players with multiple goals this season, the defensive and offensive lines are looking strong heading into Friday’s game. 
The Trojans will be taking on Long Beach Friday at 1 p.m. on McAlister Field on senior day. After this game, the Trojans will close begin conference play against University of Washington on Sept. 22.

On Thursday, USC struck yet another blow to the values of transparency, empathy and moral high ground it claims it wants its new president to espouse. A Daily Trojan reporter entered Town and Gown for a general listening session meant to gather community input on the University’s next leader, but they were instructed by a University spokesperson to not take notes or write down quotes for an article. The spokesperson explained that our reporter was welcome to attend as a student — but not as a journalist. They then instructed the Daily Trojan to join other media outlets, including the Los Angeles Times, to instead interview students following the event. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
This is not the first time USC has deliberately ignored student voices. On Aug. 30, the Daily Trojan editorial board condemned the University’s choice to exclude student representatives from a 23-person search committee tasked with the selection of USC’s next president. Trustees and administrators failed to include students in the process, despite explicit advocacy from both the undergraduate and graduate student governments that students be given a stake in the decision-making.
Instead, in what the Daily Trojan editorial board deemed a hollow consolation prize, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso invited students and members of the community to listening sessions to share recommendations with the committee. The first of these forums took place Wednesday at Town and Gown and was exclusively attended by 600 student leaders. Bolstered by the fact that the members of the presidential search committee present did not take questions or respond to student comments, student speakers said they  told the committee they valued transparency and accountability from the next president but told the Daily Trojan they felt their voices were still not being heard by the current administration. 
The University said that its decision to bar journalists was to ensure that speakers “feel comfortable sharing their perspectives freely, which is much easier to do in a session that is not being recorded or reported on.” But it is within our right as USC’s independent student-run newspaper, to cover a public forum open to all members of the USC community.
Administrators’ decision to impose restrictions on student media coverage — on this crucial event that exists to seek the USC community’s insights — further silences student voices. In restricting student reporting on comments at a public forum, USC diminishes the value it places on dialogue that must occur between students and administrators. Students’ direct comments to the presidential search committee should be published to hold administrators accountable for what is said in these listening sessions. This dialogue which exists to improve our University beyond the search for a new president — cannot exist in a vacuum, at a time and place USC deems convenient. 
We, as student journalists dedicated to covering this University, should not be treated like any other news outlet. Barring the Los Angeles Times is one thing, but the University went too far by banning its own student journalists. We are — first and foremost — students whose needs and concerns have been overshadowed, whose questions have gone unanswered. If the Daily Trojan cannot provide objective information to fellow USC students, the University will never achieve the “transparency” it so supposedly desires. 
USC has already failed to include a student representative on its search committee. It is  now imperative that it recognizes the crucial role student media serves in disseminating information to our peers, parents and alumni, who all have a stake in this University but were not present at these forums. The student press is an indispensable part of the ongoing discussion necessary to reform and reshape this campus, highlighting the concerns of a student body that has been left in the dark, scandal after scandal. 
Furthermore, after the Daily Trojan tweeted news of the media ban, the same USC representative asked our reporter to delete the tweet. According to the Student Press Law Center, student publications have no obligation to remove material from their websites or social media as long as it is neither defamatory nor an invasion of individual privacy. “The fact that someone finds it embarrassing or bothersome does not obligate you to take it down,” the SPLC website states. 
Presumably, the University is embarrassed and bothered to have been called out on its exclusion first of student voices and now of student press from being involved in the presidential search. But asking a student newspaper to censor its independent — not to mention legally obtained — reporting on indisputable facts is a new low, even for USC and its not-so-illustrious history of scandals. This is a blatant disregard for the very democratic principles on which student media was established. We stand by our decision to refuse the University’s groundless request that we delete our Twitter post.
Once again, USC is attempting to shield its decision-making processes from the public, perpetuating a culture of secrecy and confidentiality in a search that requires our entire community’s attention. The Daily Trojan exists as a watchdog for the University and by asking us to stop doing our jobs, or by barring us from being able to report on matters central to the well-being of the student body, the administration is asking for unimpeded liberty to act as it pleases behind closed doors. 
We are tired of being talked down to, excluded, repeatedly silenced and, now, flatly censored. We will not allow the University and its obfuscatory tendencies to stop us from sharing important stories or reporting breaking news relevant to the community we serve.
Our voices matter, and we will not back down.

 The opening comment of the first presidential search forum Wednesday embodied some students’ greatest concern: Students do not feel that their opinions are recognized by USC’s administration.
“It’s very clear that [Chairman Rick Caruso] said that adding students to this committee will complicate the process, as it has already begun,” said Rick Keaton, chief of staff of Undergraduate Student Government. 
Keaton asked Trustee David Bohnett for his thoughts on the chairman’s comment.
“This is a point of order here,” interim president Wanda Austin interrupted. “This is not a question and answer session — this is a listening session.”
The appointed 23-person search committee for the next president consists of trustees and faculty. Twelve were present at Wednesday’s listening session at Town and Gown. The session was exclusive to 600 student leaders invited by Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry. It was moderated by Trustee William McMorrow.
“I think it was interesting that there wasn’t really a conversation … a back-and-forth, an opportunity for students to hear why … there isn’t a student representative on the committee,” said Mai Mizuno, a senior majoring in international relations and philosophy, politics and law, after the event. 
The town hall-style listening session lasted for about an hour, with students voicing the qualities they hope to see in a new president, and what campus issues the administration should address. Comments were wide-ranging, from issues of mental health and diverse faculty retention to campus over-policing and sustainability goals. 
Throughout, students echoed similar sentiments: They want a president with integrity and good moral character, who can be empathetic to the concerns of students, faculty, staff and the local L.A. community.
“The biggest quality I think a president needs is empathy,” said Helenes President Alexa Huerta. “We need someone who is empathetic to the surrounding community members … for those who have the potential to succeed, but may not have the resources to achieve the same level of success as others.”
Some student leaders also spoke about various scandals that hit USC, following their publication in the Los Angeles Times.
“Trust is earned, and so I hope that the next president will be someone who could earn our trust with tangible actions and measures that give us a reason to continue putting faith into the people who lead us,” said USG President Debbie Lee. 
In addition to addressing desired qualities of a future president, students clamored for long-term solutions for campus problems, beyond appointing a new University leader.

Students said they wanted the committee to pay close attention to the issues brought up at the forum, after noticing some members not taking notes. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Students also shared personal experiences of poor mental health services and of losing close faculty advisors. 
“In the four years that I’ve been here I’ve lost two advisors, both transgender faculty members because this university cannot retain trans, queer or women of color faculty,” said Emmett Harsin Drager, the Graduate Student Government vice president of advocacy. 
Speakers representing all types of student groups expressed their hopes for improved diversity and inclusion, but a leadership quality they emphasized was respect.
“I want someone who won’t infantilize [students] … who will demand the same respect from all faculty, staff, administrators and trustees towards the students — the students that make this a university rather than a glorified, glamorized and corporate think tank,” said Kristopher Coombs Jr., the GSG vice president of programming. Coombs’ message was met with resounding applause from students.
These listening sessions are the first phase of the presidential search, as the committee seeks to understand challenges and gain input, McMorrow said. Following the sessions, the committee will search for and narrow the number of candidates before the Board of Trustees officially selects the new president. The search is expected to be completed in another three to six months, McMorrow said.
“At the core of it, I’m just extremely proud of what happened here tonight and I thought that the ideas everyone had and the feedback they gave us in many cases was spot-on,” McMorrow said. “The thing that I heard over and over again, as I said at the end, was that the students, which are our clients, they want to see this great quality of empathy and a moral high ground in our new leader.”

The event panelists discussed women in journalism and the importance of pushing for diversity not only in the newsroom, but also in content produced and the audience it’s being produced for. (Maansi Manchanda | Daily Trojan)
Leaders from different parts of the news media industry gathered at Wallis Annenberg Hall for the Media’s Gender Revolution panel on Wednesday to discuss the role of women in journalism.
The panelists included Marsha Cooke, senior vice president of content strategy at VICE; Kim Masters, editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter and Willow Bay, dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. 
Cindi Leive, a senior fellow in Annenberg’s Center on Communication Leadership and Policy and former editor-in-chief of Glamour magazine moderated the panel.
The discussion emphasized the need for more women and women of color in newsrooms and leadership roles in the news media industry. According to Leive, the number of women in newsrooms has risen 1 percent since 2001. What’s more, women of color compose 8 percent of print newsroom staff and 6 percent of local radio staffs while two-thirds of women journalists globally said they’ve experienced abuse or harassment. 
“It has to change, not just for women’s sake but for the sake of a free press, which can’t plausibly do its job if half its members are kept from being able to flourish,” Leive said. “If you believe in what journalism does, then you need every person who is talented and committed to be able to grow and not to need to quake with fear when called into her boss’ office, not to worry that her male peers are being paid more than her and not to have positions denied to her.”
During the nearly quarter century she worked in broadcast news and at CBS, she never saw a woman in a major leadership position, Cooke said. Now at VICE, where her new boss is a woman, Cooke said there is a push to increase diversity in the staff and that it should be applied to all newsrooms. 
“She wants to see diversity not just from the content that we produce, but we have to take a look at who our audience is,” Cooke said. “If we’re not recognizing our audience and not having our staff reflect the audience and the content that we produce, we’re not going to succeed.” 
Masters, who helped break stories on sexual harassment at Amazon and other corporations and industries, said that some people have told her they are bored with coverage of sexual harassment allegations in various industries. Still, she said it’s important for journalists to tell these stories to end the culture that allows powerful men to harass women. 
“We have to do what we can to root out the culture that has been so dominant in the entertainment world, the media world, and I think the world period,” Masters said. “We can’t let up. If people don’t want to read it, too bad.” 
Bay said she remains optimistic about the future of women in the news media because she sees more companies seeking out qualified women to fill leadership positions and increase gender diversity. This past week, Bay said seeing journalist Christiane Amanpour take over Charlie Rose’s spot at PBS after he was ousted over sexual harassment allegations and seeing Beth Mowans, the first female play-by-play announcer to call a game on Monday Night Football were “glimmers of hope” for the future of women leaders in media. 
Bay also said she sees employers recruiting more diverse groups of students for their young workforce.
“Looking at a generation of young women that is equipped beyond our wildest imaginings with the mindset and skill set to take advantage of these doors being opened, I believe this is a moment of powerful change,” Bay said. “It’s not going to be easy. It’s not going to be pretty. It’s going to be bumpy and uneven, but I truly believe that this is a sign of hope and is a sign of change.”

Amid the chaos of national politics last summer, California, in a more hopeful political moment, passed Senate Bill 174, a law that will allow noncitizen immigrants to hold certain public offices. This is a step in the right direction, but immigrant oppression is reaching a fever pitch, and this small step to empower immigrants will hardly provide substantial pressure on right-wing, anti-immigrant policy. 
Currently, noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections, and cannot hold any office federally or in California beyond public boards and commissions. As such, their political power is very limited. To push for pro-immigration policy, noncitizens are forced to rely on citizens to altruistically take on their interests or they must take part in direct action to influence their lawmakers. 
The former hardly seems likely, at least in the short term, under the current anti-immigrant leadership at the national level. In fact, the trend of immigration policy is already a massive human rights issue.
The Occupy ICE movement made encouraging progress through direct political action — for example, the movement in Portland forced an ICE building to close for over a week in June — but so far hasn’t shown sustained growth or meaningful coverage in the press. Most advancements occurred in June and July, and police have hardly been shy about arresting ICE protesters. Popular protests like Occupy ICE should be commended and encouraged, but it’s also important that every group in the country has more formal political leverage. Considering noncitizens cannot hold any office responsible for creating policy, we must start a dialogue about incorporating them more formally into our democracy.
Underlying the struggle for immigrant rights is the reality that noncitizens’ fates in America largely depends on citizens adopting their interests and giving them a political voice. Because their struggle is not necessarily intertwined with most citizens’ daily lives, interest seems to spike and die out according to the news cycle. Just over a month ago, the public looked shaken and horrified that our country’s institutions appeared hateful toward immigrants. But now, updates on child separation are no longer headline news. Though the courageous efforts of activists, lawyers and social workers shouldn’t be overlooked, many cries for solidarity with noncitizens were short-lived. 
It’s also important to highlight the long trend of immigrant oppression before the Trump administration; The zero tolerance policy didn’t appear out of nowhere. We like to imagine that Democrats take a more sympathetic stance toward undocumented communities, but should not forget that former president Barack Obama deported more people than any other president and normalized detention facilities as a way of dealing with undocumented immigrants, particularly during the influx of unauthorized border crossing in 2014. 
Blaming Trump as the source of all our ails can make us forget about the structural issues contributing to the daily struggles of immigrants. Still, family separation is unique to the Trump presidency and the administration’s racist policies pose a mounting threat to all minorities, especially noncitizens. 
SB 174 is a nice nod to the social value of noncitizens, but in reality the law will do very little to bolster the human rights of immigrants. California, and the country at large, needs more comprehensive change. Noncitizens deserve more than just a slight acknowledgment. 
This issue is particularly relevant to USC students, as many students come from different countries but plan on starting a life in the United States. Between 2004 and 2016, about 1.5 million college graduates sought out and received authorization to remain in the U.S. to begin their careers through the federal government’s Optional Practical Training program. So many students here represent a valuable part of society, one that pays taxes and plays an integral role in the economy. This indispensable demographic, though they are not naturalized citizens, deserve a voice in the legislative process.
There’s a reason that the American right wing focuses so much on voter fraud and stokes fears about undocumented voters: Its agenda poses a huge threat to noncitizens, whose political empowerment could threaten Republican power. That’s why it’s so important to resist such a hateful agenda. Noncitizens share this country and deserve an equal political position to anyone else.
A Gallup poll recently reported that 75 percent of the country view immigration as a good thing. The right wing, including Trump, does not truly represent a majority of the country. It doesn’t represent the people who are systematically disenfranchised, who feel the brunt of discriminative policy without playing a role in its creation. America should look to make a democracy that actually includes the most vulnerable people in the country. While the new senate bill is an admirable move to enhance our country’s democracy, we must consider new ways to entrench pro-immigrant voices into our political structures.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
It seems nearly impossible not to become visibly aggravated when a person says something that you disagree with. I’ve been in this situation very often — enough for me to remain calm and respectful toward those with different opinions.
I personally like to hear the ideas of those who disagree with me. When having a discussion on facts and philosophy, I want to hear as much as I can about others’ viewpoints and objectives, and open myself up to any new information they can give me about the subject at hand. I particularly enjoy it when people offer different insights, but I understand that not many people enjoy discussing issues with people they are at odds with. It’s an uncomfortable process. 
However, I also know that all people like to see the country moving toward a happier, safer and more productive place for them and their children. I know that the only way to get there is to try to see the other side’s perspective. Regardless of whether or not you like to truly understand other perspectives and the knowledge of politics, it is within your very best interest to listen to them, as it allows all participants to assess common goals and how to work toward them. For example, my best friend is an adamant supporter of President Donald Trump, whereas I don’t appreciate him as a role model. We’ve talked about our differences and, as a result, I respect the president despite my reservations and my friend better understands the issues he presents.
In an attempt to talk to someone on the other side of the political spectrum, it is important to keep all judgment out of the discussion. If you genuinely want to know why someone who is pro-life doesn’t believe in abortion, ask them questions with the goal of understanding their perspective, rather than trying to prove them wrong. Before defending your personal opinion, listen to their opinion first. Consider it carefully and thoughtfully. Speak sincerely, with genuine interest and curiosity. Ask questions authentically, without condescension or malice, and people will respond sincerely, according to Judy Barber’s book, “Good Question! The Art of Asking Questions to Bring About Positive Change.”  
Keep in mind that others’ opinions and thoughts are rooted in their own experiences and upbringings. The context in which we see, hear or feel things can greatly impact our impressions of them for the rest of our lives. Remember that we can never, no matter how hard we try, completely understand someone else’s life experiences.
And others, no matter how much effort they put in, will never be able to completely understand your background, so it is best to try and communicate individual thought processes as effectively as possible. No matter what you aim to achieve by means of a conversation, always speak from personal perspective. 
Saying, “I feel,” and, “I think,” and, “Personally, I find,” is to remain true to yourself and your identity. The “I” technique also makes it easier for another person to understand your perspective because the “I” reminds them of your humanity and subjectivity. The “I” strategy serves as an important reminder to you that your thoughts and opinions are those that are relative to your own experiences and goals. To me, it is helpful to repeatedly acknowledge that the message I’m trying to communicate is a result of my own experiences and knowledge.
I understand that I am limited in my own perspective, which is one of the reasons I seek to see others’ viewpoints. Learning more, regardless of what I’m learning about, further enhances my own credibility and, therefore, my opinion as a politically active citizen. To quote Socrates, “I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.” 
True wisdom lies in being open to the ideas and knowledge of others. Having productive conversations to comprehend others’ perspectives helps us better understand how to help everyone, not just those who share similar interests.

It has been almost a year since Cafe Dulce served up its first cup of coffee at USC Village, and the coffee has been flowing nonstop since. Undeterred by the constant long lines, I spent a semester (and a whole lot of money) waking up every day to a Dulce iced mocha.
Living at USC Village is a bit of a trap in forming a coffee habit, but after countless cups, I finally feel qualified to award Dulce the prize for best Village coffee — Starbucks’ endless customization options can’t compare to perfectly roasted beans (its beans have a reputation for being a tad over-roasted), and BBCM should stick to making food instead of overcharging for food coloring on lattes. 
Dulce is the closest cafe to campus that employs key characteristics of cafe culture — plentiful seating, a focus on coffee before food and an ambient space for anyone to stop in. I popped in on a busy Friday afternoon to have a chat with one of the shop’s baristas to understand the cafe’s culture better and how Dulce’s employees interact with the USC community. 
The baristas were all eager to chat with me, despite the apparent busyness of the cafe. “It’s always like this,” one of them laughed at my concern. And as I sat outside at one of the wooden tables, sipping my usual iced mocha, Jordan Pedersen, a USC alumnus who works as a barista at Dulce, took the seat across from me, eager to talk about his experiences at the cafe.
DT: How [has working at Dulce] been since it opened? Did you work at the Little Tokyo location?
JP: No I didn’t. But I looked at what places were coming into the Village, and I saw Dulce on there … The influence I’ve seen them leave on their customers in Little Tokyo — they’re quite active in the community there, in doing fundraisers for Little Tokyo and things like that.
DT: What’s your favorite drink on the menu? What would you recommend, and what is your personal favorite?
JP: Mood, weather, all these things play influence … Most of the time I default to the iced Hong Kong milk tea … The assam they use is really delicious — I love that one. Another backup, would be pretty much any of the iced matchas.
DT: Dulce has a new summer tea, right?
JP: We started offering the rose iced tea! I think that might be for a limited time though. At the beginning of the summer we were also doing a raspberry matcha, with our blueberry and regular.
DT: So whenever you have something new, do the other locations also make it?
JP: Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. They offered these summer refreshers that we didn’t have, that were really delicious, and I think our food menu here is more expanded than theirs is. I don’t think they have the dinner. Part of that is for experimental reasons, but also because of our demographic here.
DT: What is the best conversation you’ve had with a customer?
JP: Over the years, I’ve learned a little Armenian. Sometimes a customer will come up and I think they’re Armenian, or I’ll see it from their name, or something that gives it away … There was this couple that came in, and as I was helping them with their order — we already were having a great time talking — I said, “[in Armenian] Are you Armenian?” and they were like, “WHAT?” and they were just blown away. I went out of my way to do a couple of things for them, and they really appreciated it. And they were like, “We want to come back and see you sometime.” That was a really great time.
DT: What else would you say defines your experience here?
JP: I would just be remiss if I didn’t talk about our staff. There’s a lot of diversity in our staff, and they’re really cool … They love the customers, and we’re constantly sharing with each other ideas of how we can better … everyone is very welcoming to take advice. The owner, James Choi, [is] a really sweet guy. He’s just got an incredible vision for his company … They really care about the quality of the ingredients that they’re using. Every time I see Eugene [the manager here], he’s making something new. [He’s] very much [thinking], “No, we’re going to serve what we want to serve, based on quality, not how efficient it is for us to serve it.”
DT: What roasts do you guys currently use?
JP: Right now, we’re playing a lot with Ritual, with a little bit of Grace, with lots of Sweet Bloom … [We use] Copa Vida as well. Those are the main guys we rotate through.
DT: What do you guys do with all the food at the end of the night?
JP: We usually pack a box for DPS, and on our way out we’ll give it to them. But other than that, whatever’s left over, we let the staff take, and toss the rest of them, and make fresh ones in the morning. 
The people are just as important as the product, but sometimes as customers we don’t consider the other side of the interaction — Pedersen took a moment to recall his best moments at Dulce.
As we wrapped up our talk, he left me with a helpful tip for my quest of trying everything on the menu: “One thing: If you’re worried about powerful coffee at any time, watch out for the cold brew. We make crazy strong cold brew. I remember my first time trying it … Oh man, I was wired.”

At Tuesday night’s show, Phoenix, comprising vocalist Thomas Mars, Deck d’Arcy, Laurent Brancowitz and Christian Mazzalai, played a range of classics from its lengthy discography, notably its 2009 “Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,” which earned the band a Grammy. (Matthew Philips | Daily Trojan)
On Tuesday night, French pop-rock band Phoenix performed the fourth of its self-proclaimed five-show residency at Los Angeles’ Fonda Theatre. Still touring off of its 2017 album “Ti Amo,” the band used the residency as an opportunity to tailor the Fonda to its live show, decorating the venue with an Italian telefono booth. The Fonda, a small venue for the band’s arena-sized ballads and stage presence, provided a more intimate show for a band as interactive with their audience as Phoenix. In this case, the interaction was amplified by the venue’s 1,200-person capacity. 
The show began rather unusually for a concert, as Phoenix enlisted a presenter dressed in a suit to introduce the band in English, Spanish and Italian. When she finished, the opening notes to “J-Boy” emanated from the stage, and a colorful display of lights illuminated the six men on stage. The romantic dance ballad willed the crowd to their feet, and the band immediately pushed the energy forward with “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” highlight “Lasso.”
Despite their crisp, squeaky clean instrumentation, Phoenix brought an unique edge to traditional pop performances with their primal drumming and intricate songwriting. At the beginnings of “Lasso” and“Entertainment,”drummer Thomas Hedlund pounded his bass drum with a purpose audible enough to engage eager moshers scattered throughout the audience. Surprisingly, the audience had no issue singing along to every word of frontman Thomas Mars’ seemingly unending verses, especially on lyrical mazes such as “If I Ever Feel Better,” “Lisztomania” and “Role Model.”
Outside of “If I Ever Feel Better,” Phoenix reached back into their wheelhouse of other songs pre-”Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix,” masterfully mixing in fan favorites like “Long Distance Call” and “Consolation Prizes.”
The momentum propelled by the band’s flurry of hit songs came to a screeching halt when they played both parts of “Love Like a Sunset.” The opening keys and deep, heavy bass part signaled a change in energy, and Mars in turn used the song as an opportunity to take a breather, lying on his back on stage for the song’s entirety. Smooth basslines and funky synthesizers carried the instrumental track through the end. When the second part began, burnt orange and pink lights pervaded the stage, and brothers and guitarists Laurent Brancowitz and Christian Mazzalai traded guitar riffs between optimistic lyrics from Mars.
As is the case with many shows in the city, it’s always a guessing game as to who might show up. On this cool Tuesday night, the French pop rockers brought out songwriter and multi instrumentalist Beck to sing “Lovelife,” a standout track off of “Ti Amo.” Beck followed this up by asking Mars to help him sing a couple of his own songs, including “Lost Cause” and “Jack-Ass.” Beck’s appearance and subsequent duets were memorable, if brief, and the tightly packed crowd of indie fans bid farewell to the decorated musician with enthusiastic cheers and applause.
In the band’s four-song encore, Mars made use of the estranged telefono booth during “Telefono,” even recreating the multilingual voicemail from the beginning of the song. No Phoenix show would be complete without an all-out celebration of its smash hit “1901,” where the audience found what little gas they had left in the tank to scream and shout the infectious “fold it” chorus. Finally, the show ended with a special rendition of “Ti Amo,” accompanied by Mars delivering high-fives to the audience and crowd-surfing his way around the entire dance floor. As the band left the stage for the final time, audience members were encouraged to stay, dance and eat gelato courtesy of the band, a request that many fans happily obliged.
If the surplus of smiles and sweat-soaked denim jackets exiting the venue were any indication, Phoenix shattered expectations of what a live pop performance could be. In the residency, the innovative band gave longtime fans the exclusive Phoenix experience they deserved, and, in some strange way, the show felt a homecoming for the band.

“Bel Canto” is slated for release Friday. The film was directed by Paul Weitz (left), who spoke at SCA on Tuesday night. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
It took “Bel Canto,” a film based on Ann Patchett’s highly acclaimed 2001 novel, almost two decades to reach the golden screen. Inspired by real events that occured in Peru in 1996, the narrative takes a fresh approach to the typical hostage crisis situation: Rather than approaching the story with jump-scares and gore, Patchett chose to explore and test the boundaries of human compassion within the hostage situations. However, the film’s message is blurred by the dullness of its film adaptation, directed by Paul Weitz, best known for films like “American Pie” and “Little Fockers.” 
“The hardest artistic choice was to make [the movie] because I thought it’d come off as too pretentious [with its discussions of death],” Weitz said in the Q&A  following a screening of the movie at the School of Cinematic Arts on Tuesday, 
Knowing how an overall histrionic tone can make a movie less genuine, Weitz seemed to restrain his film. Unfortunately, “Bel Canto” suffered from failing to perfect this notion, as the production feels too safe and uneventful. While most movies suffer from being overly dramatic, “Bel Canto” isn’t dramatic enough in portraying a threatening hostage crisis.
The film traces a hostage crisis in 1997: Opera singer Roxane Cross (Julianne Moore) is giving a private concert to a group of wealthy individuals, including Katsumi Hosokawa (Ken Watanabe), somewhere in South America. Suddenly, a group of guerillas take over the mansion and agree to free their newly acquired hostages in exchange for the release of their comrades, who are currently political prisoners. Over a month, the hostages and their keepers form an unlikely bond, supported by the occasional musical performance. 
Despite its unusual premise, the film almost feels like it’s set on autopilot. For instance, the initial seizing of the mansion should have been a climactic, pivotal scene, but its execution comes across as casual and predictable.
Both wealthy individuals and guerilla members try to form relationships as the hostage crisis increases in urgency: At its core, the film attempts to venture into the political. However, because the initial takeover lacked any tension, the contrast between the hostages and their keepers is not as stark as it should be. In this way, the interactions don’t feel earned; rather, they come across as staged or contrived.
The failure to convincingly have these two sides interact with each other is also, in part, because of the inconsistent pacing. After a few minutes, the film jumps right to the takeover, providing barely any time to establish the opening shot or the importance of the various characters. Even though the first 48 minutes of the film run at a brisk pace, the film drags considerably afterward. 
The movie’s overall passivity extends to its characters. In the post-screening discussion, Weitz said, “I wanna be open to improvisation, [and] sometimes, it’s on an emotional level […] In [one] case the scene dictated someone to be laughing, but the actor started crying, which seemed to fit the scene better.”
While this is a great method in directing actors, it wasn’t reflected in the final film, as the actors seemed to make little effort in making their nameless characters engaging. Watanabe gives the best performance as Hosokawa, but even then, the bulk of his appeal lies in his preexisting star power. Moore’s performance, while passable, fails to relay nuances of her character’s personality. 
A romance between Hosokawa’s translator Gen (Ryo Kase) and guerilla soldier Carmen (María Mercedes Coroy) exemplifies the film’s lack of grounding in reality, as the romance is only established through the gossip of other characters.
The film is unpredictable, as it doesn’t fall into the trap of many Hollywood productions wherein everything works out conveniently for the main characters. There is some sense of consequence and the film uses this opportunity to voice its controversial message of sympathy among unlikely groups one last time.
The idea of befriending those with differing backgrounds in difficult situations is undoubtedly important, particularly in our increasingly turbulent political climate. As dull as the film may be due its pacing and underdeveloped characters, Weitz deserves acclaim for his touching portrayal of human connection throughout the film.
