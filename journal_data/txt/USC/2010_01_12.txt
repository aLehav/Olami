Just minutes after Lane Kiffin addressed his Tennessee Volunteer players to inform them he was leaving town to become the next head coach of the USC football program, he was greeted by dozens of fans outside the Neyland-Thompson Sports Complex determined to “politely” send him on his way to City of Angels in proper fashion.
According to govolsextra.com, a small crowd of hostile students and fans made their way into the Neyland-Thompson Sports Complex Tuesday night, hoping to let the now former-Volunteer coach know exactly how they felt. As Kiffin left the meeting with his players (some of whom had left before he finished) and headed toward a nearby office where his final press conference was to be held, Volunteer Nation overwhelmed the 34-year-old coach with a variety of obscenities and distasteful parting shots.
While Kiffin awkwardly faced the media with a few disingenuous words and an “I have a plane to catch” look on his face, his California dream was delayed with an unexpected rocky departure, thanks to the livid Tennessee faithful who had gathered outside the complex.
As the coach slowly drove through the streets of campus one final time, he was serenaded by a much larger crowd than the one police officers quietly quelled inside the sports complex — Kiffin’s car was allegedly chased down by members of the student body in what is being called a “mini-riot” or “stampede.”
The incident, which featured an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 students, also included mattress burnings, continuous obscenities and an array of inappropriate paintings made on the university’s most famous landmark “The Rock.”  The Knoxville News-Sentinel reported late Tuesday evening that local police officials were called in to tear gas the crowd.
Kiffin’s violent farewell not only set off the Volunteers’ fan base, but left several players stunned and searching for answers.
“I’m just so hurt by the fact he’s leaving us after we bought in and did everything he asked us to,” defensive end Ben Martin told the Chattanooga Free Press.
“Three coaches in three years? Unbelievable, man. Unbelievable,” said linebacker LaMarcus Thompson.
Luckily for Kiffin, he won’t have to return to his well-wishers in Knoxville until 2021 or 2022, when the Trojans and Volunteers are scheduled to play a home-and-home series. That of course, hinges upon whether he can take the USC program back to the top of the rock in college football. If not, I’m pretty sure the city of Los Angeles has thrown a few riots in its day.
I guess that is why Kiffin when to USC – his classiness.  And the classiness of a university with NCAA investigators taking up residence in the dorms to save of gas.  The farewell was fitting for the departure.
Stay classy, TN.
It will be really interesting to see the reception Kiffin receives if he were to still be the coach when the home-and-home series takes place. Having done my undergraduate mere miles outside Knoxville, I know how passionate (and delusional) that fan base is. They even play “Rocky Top” in hip-hop clubs.
Also, Tennessee basketball player Renaldo Woolridge watched the events transpire from his dorm balcony and tweeted them as they happened. You can check him out on Twitter @Swiperboy and read what he saw. We also took a look at what the Tennessee fans reaction was on Facebook to Kiffin’s departure…let’s just say it wasn’t pretty:

“USC sucks!”
“The giant has been slain!”
“You guys are fast-paced downhill now!”
By now, we’ve heard our fair share of taunts from Westwood and beyond. 
Why do these comments hurt so much? Why am I so offended?
At the University of Southern California, the student body is drawn from a variety of different backgrounds.
Living through adolescence and trying to answer the ubiquitous question, “Who am I?”, we are suddenly sent to college as young adults to expect to find an answer there.
With the past seven years of expected wins and championships, it has been easy for us to identify with our football team to fill the “who am I” void, to finally say, “I am a Trojan,” knowing that people will automatically think “amazing football team.”
With this newfound identity however, a loss by our football team produces pain and depression, and a harsh remark brings offense and anger. My team’s shortcomings are my shortcomings; their failures are my failures.
Speaking with a therapist whose husband attended USC about this identity issue, she said, “Pete Carroll represented a paternal figure for students. He represented a belief system,” — referring to Carroll’s strong and active stance that everyone deserves a chance. All of his players competed every day for their jobs, just like we have to compete in life. Carroll displayed this belief system in his recruiting, team practices and charity work. His faithful manner was something we took pride in, something we embraced.
Now, as he leaves us, we face uncertainty with the future of our football program, and we find ourselves dazed and confused, even abandoned. Imagine USC returning to the high school quality of the ’90s.
We could always fall back on our academic reputation, but will that be enough for our collective identity? The uncertain future of USC’s reputation was furthered when President Steven B. Sample announced his resignation in the fall.
Though it’s unlikely for USC’s academic integrity to fall, and our football team (though more unpredictable) still has potential, the reality is that changes in leadership at USC or any other university determines the ability of the university to provide a reliable identity for all of us.
Daily Trojan | Julia Vann
I was curious to see how students identified themselves during the inglorious Paul Hackett years, so I phoned a USC alumnus who attended the university in 1999 when the Coliseum was filled with “Fire Hackett” signs.
On students identifying strongly with the team, he quickly replied, “No, of course not! It’s never like that when your team isn’t great.”
Regarding the students’ identities, he said, “For the past several decades, the Trojan family really has served as a family for students. They come to ’SC, and after a semester of settling in, they realize they are a part of something larger than themselves.”
He also remarked that although students were a part of the Trojan family during his years at USC, they were much more “individualized,” and they did not rely heavily on football, but sought out who they are and how they contributed to the family.
Carroll departs USC after a disappointing season, leaving an uncertain future for our football program. but his departure also presents us with an interesting opportunity.
The loss of Carroll and a declining football team gives us the opportunity to seek out a fuller identity — something stronger, steadier. This is our chance to broaden our perspective. Perhaps football has been a diversion from developing a more complex and differentiated identity, one that will serve our futures better. What else do we want to be known for? What else do we want to be proud of?
Carroll, we have appreciated and respected you and are grateful for your leadership. But we will stand on our own feet and make choices as we seek our potential as human beings while still remaining part of the Trojan family.
In this microcosm of the world we call college, we have the unique freedom to pursue activities, receive training and live life before we hit the post-graduation real world. A wise man, Dave Martinelli, once told me, “College sets the trajectory for the rest of your life.”
This is a great moment to find our own way and seize our destiny in the world.
Fight on!

U$C had a nice run, but it’s over. Time for the school to focus on academics right now. As much as we all like to have a nationally known football program, success comes in cycles and U$C is about to be in for one long nasty fall when the NCAA drops the hammer. But at least the Trojans still have basket…no wait, nevermind.
Well, I’m a senior and will say bye-bye this May. It’s awesome that USC is one of those schools that boasts an elite football program…But c’mon, what’s the real gist of higher education? The academics!!!  While Westwood is gloating at us now, they’ve always held a prestigious academic reputation. I won’t expound on it, but we know ‘SC used to be a party school with lenient admissions years ago, and I’m also aware that times have changed dramatically since then. And often, it was what they always bring up, to rationalize why their school is better than ours, whenever we trump their high school level football team. The academic world respects UCLA more than us. 
But maybe, instead of riding the pride of our football team, the next successor to President Sample should strive to climb the academic rankings further a la getting more Nobel laureates, delving more into research and the likes. There needs to a be fine balance. Just because we got, or HAD, an elite football team doesn’t mean the job recruiter will hire you for a touchdown you didn’t achieve. The IDENTITY of the school is more than football.

It’s the first week back at school, so we all know what that means: new classes and lots and lots of partying — cue the fraternities’ Spring 2010 recruitment process, which launches this weekend with a series of pre-rush house parties.
Pre-rush has been largely celebrated for years among the USC student population — for some it’s an opportunity to preview fraternities they might be interested in joining or partying at this semester.  For others,  it’s an opportunity for some free booze.
The USC Interfraternity Council is always the subject of harsh scrutiny on campus. Any time recruitment rolls around the skeptics start shaking their heads and pointing their fingers as they scorn all the ruthless debauchery that takes place on The Row.
Daily Trojan | Julia Vann
Prior to formal rush week, most fraternities host large parties during pre-rush, the week prior to rush, in order to create buzz and draw in a greater amount of potential new members. In the past, the parties have been known to get a little out of hand — leading to some inevitable black-outs and vomiting — which does little to help to showcase benefits of the Greek system to skeptical parents of eager new rushees.
In a move to address these concerns, the rules surrounding pre-rush parties have changed drastically in the past year. Fraternities are no longer allowed to serve hard alcohol and freshmen may not attend. The new regulations also help even the playing field between all the different fraternity houses during recruitment, though it seems that larger houses will always have an advantage.
While the new rush regulations might dampen some of the fun, they represent a positive step forward for USC’s Greek system to better improve its reputation and ensure the safety of our students.
The main concern, however, is whether or not the moves are actually effective in improving student safety, or if they merely give the illusion of positive change. The new regulations do little to promote moderation.
Is it not true that students can get just as drunk off of champagne and beer as they can on vodka and rum? And who exactly is checking everyone’s I.D.s to ensure that no 18-year-olds sneak through the doors?
It seems USC might just be cracking down on IFC in order to dispel the university’s reputation as a party school.  The new regulations provide the Greek system with a fantastic opportunity to promote its concern for safety, but not much has changed except for the fact that some girls are now staying home because they do not like the taste of beer.
There’s not much that can be done to improve the safety standards of fraternity parties without eliminating them altogether or posting policemen at every house door. Fraternities throw parties and students attend; that is simply the way of The Row. It is truly up to the students themselves to make wise choices. No one is going to force you to do a keg stand or, for that matter, to encourage someone else to do one.
It is reassuring to see that IFC at USC is taking an active interest in what goes on over on 28th Street, but their influence can only stretch so far. The changes might have been put into effect for the right reasons, but whether they have any positive impact really remains to be seen. For now, everyone planning on heading out to the Row just needs to make intelligent and safe decisions, and try to have some fun.

On the day Pete Carroll officially became the newest employee of the Seattle Seahawks it appears a new skeleton in the coach’s closest may have surfaced — a skeleton veering far from the alleged NCAA sanctions to come.
According to SI.com, Dave Watson, a former defensive line coach for the Trojans from 2006 to 2008, allegedly came clean to Carroll in February 2008 about a serious addiction to painkillers he had developed dating back to his days as a player on the Minnesota Gophers’ football team. Rather than handle the issue head on, Watson alleges that Carroll, while supportive initially, determined it was in the best interest of the former coach to conceal his addiction.
In deposition documents obtained by SI.com earlier this week, Watson claimed under oath that 12 university doctors, six with an affiliation to the football team, provided him with 1,680 tablets of prescription medication to deal with his ongoing battle. Watson was retained as a member of Carroll’s staff and was provided with a vehicle by the university.
Three months later Watson was involved in a two-car auto accident in which he errantly slammed his USC-provided vehicle into another, injuring one person. He pleaded no contest to DUI charges stemming from the accident and was given three years probation.
In January 2009, a mere eight months after the accident, Watson was released of his duties as a member of the coaching staff. However, Carroll did not cite his addiction or pending legal issues as a source for his dismissal, but rather that the coach was too hard on his players and that the program was looking to make room for Brian Schneider to take over the position of special teams coordinator.
Carroll may be forced to testify during the civil case regarding the accident in which the injured party is attempting to sue Watson and the university an estimated $500,000. According to Lance Pugmire of the Los Angeles Times, Carroll was issued a subpoena forcing him to appear for a deposition regarding the civil lawsuit while on campus for his final press conference Monday.

Hello to all the Lifestyle lovers out there! Hope everyone had a wonderful winter break (we did!). But now we’re back in the office and are already working hard to bring you another semester of awesome local and SC-centric arts, entertainment, food and tech coverage.
It’s a new year, a new decade and — as you can tell — a new blog. “That’s What We Said” is where Lifestyle’s writers and editors will be consistently posting news blips, recommendations, cool links and random musings that we couldn’t show you in print. This is the place where we can let loose (within AP style rules, of course) and do crazy things like write stuff under 500 words in length and — GASP! — use the journalism-dreaded first-person “I.” It not only gives us somewhere to throw our excess thoughts, it will hopefully be a place for you to nab the latest Lifestyle goings-on.
We’re stoked to have a blog and hope you are too. Bookmark this page and come back often. You will not be disappointed.
Sincerely, The Management (Sarah Bennett and Louis Lucero II)

Senate Republicans are stalling the White House’s efforts to confirm Erroll Southers, associate director of USC’s Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, as head of the Transportation Security Association, raising concerns about Southers’ qualifications and the vetting process.
In a letter to the White House several Republican senators voiced their concerns about Southers’ nomination. The letter contends that Southers submitted incorrect information regarding his time with the FBI and implores the administration to further investigate Southers’ background.
Clear discrepancies have been found between information Southers submitted in a document and the way he later recalled the same events. But Southers and White House officials are attributing the inconsistencies to a mere memory lapse, the Washington Post has reported.
The vote on Southers’ nomination could reach the Senate floor next week, POLITICO reports. Republicans, led by Senator Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) intend to continue fighting the nomination.

The USC swimming and diving team dominated in their duel meet against UC Santa Barbara on Saturday, where the Trojan men won 139 – 123 and the Women of Troy scored 143 – 111.
Among the highlights of the competition was the debut of juniors Richard Charlesworth and Presley Bard. Charlesworth was a 2008 Olympian for Great Britain and Bard an All-American transfer from Indiana. Both swimmers began training with the Trojans in January of last year, but were unable to compete until Saturday’s meet due to NCAA eligibility requirements.
British distance specialist Charlesworth won both his individual events clocking a 4:33.09 in the 500-yard free and a 9:21.62 in the 1000-yard free.
Bard placed first in the 100-yard back (54.99) and second in the 50-yard free (23.72).
The meet kicked off with the 200-yard medley relay where the women’s ‘A’ team starring Bard, as well as freshmen Jessica Schmitt, Yumi So and Christel Simms, took gold in a time of 1:44.28. The men’s ‘A’ team came second in a 1:33.69 in their 200-yard medley relay.
USC splashed into first place in almost every event, although they did fall short in the sprint freestyle events.
UCSB’s All-American senior Anne-Marie May beat the Women of Troy in both the 50-yard and 100-yard free, while on the men’s side UCSB’s sophomore Chris Peterson out-touched USC’s fastest men in both events.
“We told the team to throw out the times, as they were extremely tired coming off of their winter training camp,” assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said. “Instead to focus on good habits like fast turns, being disciplined in their race strategies and for the most part the team excited well.”
Junior Clement Lefert dominated the men’s butterfly events, snatching first in both the 100-yard (49.42) and the 200-yard (1:49.41), followed by freshmen Justin DiFederico who took second place with a time of 1:51.14.
Freshmen backstroker Alex Lendrum also swept his specialist events, out-touching the field in the 100-yard back with a time of 50.50 and winning the 200-yard in 1:49.38, with freshmen Brian Krump touching second (1:50.34).
Sophomore Katinka Hosszu, who was recently named Hungarian Athlete of the Year, swept all three of her individual races, clocking a 2:00.22 in the 200-yard fly, a 2:02.33 in the 200-yard back and a 4:20.83 in the 400-yard individual medley. Junior Ellie Doran came second (4:25.50), followed by Schmitt (4:26.76).
Both men’s captains posted individual wins, with senior James Martin dominating the 400-yard IM (4:01.41) and sophomore Pat White winning the 200-yard free (1:40.21). White also snagged second in the 500-yard free.
Freshmen distance star Haley Anderson controlled the 1000-yard free where she went 9:55.65 and touched almost 20 seconds ahead of Doran who once again clocked the second fastest time of 10:14.81.
Junior Lyndsay DePaul won the 200-yard free (1:49.08), while sophomore Ania Kowalcysk continued USC’s women’s breastroke reign when she touched first in the 100-yard with a time of 1:03.95.
The men will hit the pool next this weekend at the SMU Invite in Dallas, while the women have a short break until they compete Jan. 29 against Cal at the McDonald Swim Stadium.

Last week USC received the worst publicity from a former Trojan named O.J. since People V. Simpson.
In response to mounting scrutiny surrounding the O.J. Mayo investigation, Athletic Director Mike Garrett imposed a preemptive strike and penalized the university’s basketball program in hopes of alleviating potential NCAA sanctions. Garrett’s forced apology includes several recruiting restrictions, reimbursement of money to the NCAA for last year’s tournament bid, loss of scholarships, forfeit of all 21 wins Mayo helped earn over the 2007-08 season, and, most frustrating for the program’s three seniors, a ban on all post-season play for this year’s squad — including the Pac-10 and NCAA tournaments.
However, one group of students has rallied against what it sees as an injustice and taken it upon itself to amend the sanctions decreed to the basketball team.
The “Let Them Play” movement has organized t-shirt sales, a university petition and a Jan. 21 rally in the hopes of persuading the athletic department to reconsider the team’s post-season probation.
“These sanctions are unfair to the current coaching staff, players, and most of all, the students,” reads the “Let Them Play” Facebook group, nearly 3,000 strong just a week after Garrett’s announcement.  “It is on us as Trojans to show our support of USC Basketball to the NCAA and [Athletic Director] Mike Garrett so that they will let SC Basketball play!”
USC student petitions have had success in the past.
In 2004, Robbie Ellison collected over 1,000 student signatures to entice ESPN College Gameday to campus for the first time in the show’s 11 year history.
However, persuading Garrett to reach down and pull the basketball program out from under the bus may present a more significant challenge.
If “Let Them Play” hopes to put serious pressure on Garrett and the athletic department, the group will need the support of student organizations, student government and probably a few more Facebook friends.
Then again, with slogans like “Hold the Mayo” and “Fight the Man On,” “Let Them Play” shouldn’t have much trouble raising support as the season wares closer to an end and, hopefully for the group, tournament play.

The 2010 Free Application for Federal Student Aid has undergone a face-lift, designed to include fewer questions, friendlier navigation, more information and less duplication in hopes of encouraging more students to apply for financial aid.
This year’s FAFSA will allow students to skip questions that don’t apply to them, cutting down the time the application takes. It will also feature color-coded sections and a help section.
In addition, once the application is submitted, students will get an immediate estimate of their eligibility for Pell Grants and loans.
“The new FAFSA is easier to fill out by students and easier to process by schools,” Assistant Dean of Financial Aid Guy Hunter said. “But the actual calculations are not going to change.”
Parker Jung, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering, filled out the FAFSA both this year and in 2009, and said he thinks this form is a lot easier for students to do.
“Some of my friends last year had their parents do the whole thing because they couldn’t figure out how to do it,” Jung said. “For people who thought it was scary, it’ll be scary until they do it. Then they’ll realize that it’s not that bad, and it’s pretty straightforward.”
Hunter also agreed that a simpler form is beneficial to those that have trouble filling it out.
“Anytime you simplify a form, it’s going to help us,” Hunter said. “We don’t reach the majority of people who need help with it.”
But Michelle Sung, a freshman majoring in international relations and global business, said she does not think the problem with the FAFSA is its length.
“A lot of my friends don’t fill it out because they have a preset idea of whether or not they’ll receive [financial aid],” she said. “It would be a waste of time to do it if you already know that you’re not going to get any aid.”

Oh, the joys of being young and in college: the lifelong friends we meet, the endless opportunities at our feet, the valuable access to knowledge and the places to go for advanced higher learning.
And of course, there’s the partying to the wee hours of the morning, reckless nights we can barely remember and the walks of shame we’d be doing each other a favor to forget it ever happened.  
With nothing to remind you but a couple of empty bottles and a missing laptop you wish you had locked up, it’s no secret: College kids are more likely to partake in hard partying festivities at a more rigorous and aggressive pace. At the whim of a keg stand and a pretty girl, even a looming English paper or 8 a.m. class cannot slow down what will become of this random Tuesday night.
The idea of living large is not a new concept. We work hard and therefore are rightfully entitled to at least a few hours — or subsequent weeknights — to blow off steam and de-stress. Right? What’s more, drinking and wild behavior are especially desirable for well-bodied, energetic young adults, of age or not.
Though these are not any alarming developments, what is noteworthy is pop culture’s increasingly influential role. The entertainment world’s invested interest in a life surrounded by booze, late nights and techno music has recently become more direct and furious, leading to a slew of consequences.
Take MTV’s newest hit reality show, Jersey Shore. In just a few weeks, the controversial program has been drenched with scandal after scandal. Following the lives of eight cast mates living in a Jersey Shore home, MTV has been reprimanded for the show’s stereotypical portrayal of Italian-Americans, multiple accounts of bar violence — including a highly circulated scene involving a woman being full-on punched in the face by a fellow bar patron — and, of course, irresponsible amounts of exposure to ultraviolet light and tanning beds.

Besides the fact that pulling us away from our televisions may require a crowbar, what is most disastrous is that MTV’s “realistic” depiction of wild party antics suggest no consequences, but instead offer a gateway to fame and fortune. Instead of being slapped with a pair of handcuffs for bar fighting or gross public intoxication, the reality stars have quickly risen among the ranks of tabloid front-page royalty.
Recently, singer Mariah Carey gave the Jersey Shore gang a run for its money, spilling over the side of the stage at two award shows as she drunkenly slurred through her acceptance speeches. Talk show host Chelsea Handler pointed out that Carey helped her finally realize what it took to win a People’s Choice Award, saying she deserved one too because “I’m drunk all the time.”
Surely, showcasing this lifestyle without any recourse must glamorize alcoholism. The heightened attention in Hollywood provides the masses, namely unassuming young people, with an incongruous image of this potentially dangerous and out-of-control lifestyle. Though personal choice is still the ultimate factor for members of the public, shows like Jersey Shore as well as bashed celebrity behavior on television make these activities look more alluring and desirable.
Only in tragedy are we given a wake-up call. Last week Hollywood socialite and the heiress of the Johnson & Johnson fortune, 30-year-old Casey Johnson, passed away under suspicious circumstances, the most recent in a pattern of young celebrities facing trouble after living life in the fast lane.
Tired of losing friends to something so senseless, actress Lindsay Lohan and celebrity DJ Samantha Ronson took to their Twitter pages to say “Wake Up People.”
Still, since the birth of Hollywood, stars have created the illusion of a loose, unattainable lifestyle — the schmoozing, cocktails and parties — and only in drunken abandonment are we that much closer to living the fantasy. Entertainment’s frivolous outlook on the party culture encourages participation from thrill-seeking young people, many of who live out this myth within their respective college scenes. Instead, we should look past the glamour and think rationally, and act responsibly in our own personal choice.
We work hard, play hard. So as long as nobody’s hurt and tanning beds aren’t involved, the party doesn’t need to stop.

Swine flu. Sinking economy. Struggling wars overseas. These are just a few of the blights we endured in 2009. Not to mention the fact that we suffered Sarah Palin while she was “going rogue.”
It is easy to recall 2009 and shake our heads in disbelief, to hope that we were sleeping and the past 12 months were merely a prolonged nightmare. But it is important to remember that the whole value of 2009 is greater than the sum of its often-troubling parts.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
Though 2009 was not a year of obvious triumphs, it hosted a series of crucial social steps and positive political decisions that will ensure progress for the future, spurring a massive overhaul in our nation’s culture.
We should look at 2009 as a reason to be hopeful because this year was a turning point. Americans used this past year to boldly declare that we will no longer tolerate a lack of transparency in our government and that we demand to see proactive steps that will create positive change.
And proactive steps were exactly what we took. The country exhaled a collective sigh of relief when President Barack Obama was inaugurated on Jan. 20, ushering in an era of new leadership for our floundering nation.
His inauguration was also a significant display of social progress, as Obama became the first black president, an accomplishment that seemed impossible as little as 65 years ago with the segregation of troops during World War II, or even as little as 18 years ago when the Watts riots erupted in Los Angeles. Obama’s feat was made even more momentous as he was inaugurated the day after 2009’s celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Another proactive step that made 2009 a good year was the beginnings of an international agreement to control greenhouse gas emissions that took place during December’s climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark. Even Chinese officials agreed to attend the conference, despite having been key adversaries of the United States in regards to the issue of monitoring toxic emissions. Securing China’s presence and openness to some form of a climate agreement during 2009 has blazed a trail for our leaders to create politically binding agreements to help preserve our planet’s resources.
Just as Obama’s inauguration served as a catalyst for social change and the climate summit created the framework for future emissions commitments, the recent decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan for a limited duration with an emphasis on training local forces puts an end in sight for a war that has gone on too long.
This year also brought good news when activists proved that the job of building a stronger future is not solely in the hands of politicians, as communities including students and families rallied behind important issues.
Many who were disappointed by the outcome of California’s November 2008 vote to ban gay marriages used 2009 to actively support same-sex couples who wished to wed. Those against Proposition 8 were tireless in their efforts during the past year that a federal trial began Monday to determine the constitutionality of the measure that bans same-sex marriage.
Other issues affected our student community on a local level in 2009, such as President Steven B. Sample’s decision to retire. The news initially disappointed our community, but if we look beyond the surface we can see that the change in leadership provides an opportunity to positively impact students’ lives at USC in 2010.
Though his presence will be missed, President Sample’s retirement presents a healthy challenge for the current generation of USC students and faculty to uphold his legacy of academic excellence and innovation, and hopefully encourage the Trojan Family to rise to the occasion.
Of course, it is impossible to refer back to 2009 as a good year without honoring Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, the U.S. Airways pilot who miraculously landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after its engines were disabled when it hit a flock of birds during takeoff, saving the lives of all 155 people on board. His heroic act reminds us that, although there is much work to be done in crafting a better future, 2009 still gave us many tangible reasons to celebrate.
The relentless efforts made during 2009 didn’t satisfy the desire for instant gratification that our society usually enjoys via fast-food restaurants and online shopping, but these innovative strides have created an end in sight for many of the problems that previously made our futures look so bleak.
We must have patience while the steps taken in 2009 work slowly to improve the economy, end our involvement in war, heal our environment and increase peaceful international communication. Additionally, it is our responsibility to build upward from the groundwork that was laid last year.
We have so many resources at our fingertips, especially technological tools that can facilitate international communication as we make changes during 2010 — even President Obama already uses YouTube to make weekly addresses. If we continue this trend of using technology to extend our reach in creating a unified community, 2010 can set the stage for exciting large-scale change.
Because of the impact that this year’s choices will have on revitalizing our quality of life for the future, 2009 was definitely a good year.

Progress on the Expo Line — a rail line that will run down Exposition Boulevard and around the USC campus — continues to chug along, but recent developments may cause traffic congestion in some areas and unrest among citizens in others.
The final version of the project’s Environmental Impact Report was recently released, outlining the possible impacts of extending passenger train service throughout the area. The report noted several overpasses that residents desired near schools could not be built, leaving many residents upset.
The rail line will pass near Dorsey High School and Foshay Learning Center, where at-level street crossing will be built as opposed to aerial overpasses. Concerns have been and continue to be raised about the safety of the crossings, especially in areas with high numbers of children.
“Our basic objection is that the line is being built at street level, and that’s a danger,” said Damien Goodmon, coordinator of the Fix Expo Rail Campaign.
Expo Line project officials and MTA policies, however, said the street and pedestrian crossings are safe and will not be congested.
Beyond safety concerns, the project has faced budgeting and scheduling hurdles from its inception.
“This region needs rail transit,” Goodmon said. “But it does not need it built cheaply and inadequately.”
But Gabriela Collins of the Expo Line project said many of the concerns have arisen from project enhancements that were not part of the original plan. She said the main goal is simply to finish the project.
“We’ve been responsive to concerns,” Collins said. “Our focus is to work to complete construction in a timely fashion and provide an alternative to the 10 freeway, which is highly congested.”
The issues with scheduling — the project was originally set to be finished earlier than is now planned — have been brought to California Public Utilities Commissioner Timothy Simon, who said in an open letter that expediting the project is a major concern.
“You can be assured that I am fully aware of the legitimate public need for a speedy resolution,” Simon wrote. “In this regard, I have asked all of our staff to expedite this process. I consider this of the highest priority.”
The project is currently in Phase 2, which encompasses certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report and outlines an extension and certification of the rail line from Culver City to Santa Monica.
The heavy construction that can be seen around USC is part of the first phase of the Expo Line project, which consists of building the Expo Line from Culver City to Downtown Los Angeles and includes building stations alongside USC on Flower Street at 23rd Street and Jefferson Boulevard and on Exposition at USC and Expo Park.
The rail will go underground just past Jefferson at Figueroa Street and Exposition, Collins said. Now, stations are being built at Jefferson and Hoover Street as well as on Vermont  Avenue and Exposition.
Though there is no specific timeline for the construction, Collins said most of it should be completed over the course of the next year.
The rail line will run parallel to the Santa Monica Freeway, one of Los Angeles’ most congested freeways. Other stations will include Vermont, Western, Crenshaw, La Brea and La Cienega, some of the busiest streets in L.A.
Once complete, the rail will allow USC students and others easier access to all areas of Los Angeles.
“The fact that those stations are being built will provide people with easier access to the Galen Center, the Coliseum, the science center and museums without having to look or pay for parking,” Collins said.
According to the Expo Rail Line website, the rail from Culver City to Downtown L.A. via USC will be running by 2012, while the project as a whole is scheduled for completion by 2016.
Joe,  this may surprise you, but the Expo Line is being built by “Private Enterprise”. Yes, the “Owner” is a government entity that has to deal with local citizens who have used the legal system to put year after year of delay at Farmdale Ave. That is the price of living in a democracy. Now, another year of delay was caused by a City of Los Angeles entity called the Department of Water and Power. They were unable to move high voltage lines at La Cienega and La Brea despite pushing from all sides. And then there are the delays from that “Private Enterprise” builder. They had problems with basics, such as figuring out how to hire “locals” and putting enough crew members on to do the assigned tasks. When that “Private Enterprise” builder wasn’t able to complete one part of the project without more years of delay, the “Owner” fired them and a replacement “Private Enterprise” builder is coming on who is willing to meet the schedule and at a better price to the taxpayers.
You are comparing apples to oranges, Joe.  The construction of a 9 mile rail line vs. 2 buildings?  Portions of the 9 mile line that will be underground, elevated, and also a portion that will cross over the Harbor Fwy?  They are completely different animals.  It’s a poor argument you are making between private enterprise and government.  
The “little progress” you mention is because you don’t see the underground work, most of which is along Expo and Flower.  Using your logic, the Red Line made little progress (even though it carries over 140,000 passengers per day).
Compare this project to the construction of the new Cinema department building and the new campus center; it’s a great lesson in the differences between private enterprise and government. The Expo project has been going on for years with little progress, and will continue for years more, while USC has torn down and built up two new projects in no time flat.
What is Damien saying; that the students at Dorsey High School will have more problems regarding safely crossing the tracks at grade than students at 2 High Schools, Middle and elementary schools along the Gold Line East Los Angles extension (or anywhere else) will have? The Gold Line is adjacent to teases schools and the students their seam to be able to live with the Gold Line safely, yet according to Damien the students at Dorsey High School can’t. 
As for the undercrossing at USC, all one has to do is to check how many cars and pedestrians pass the Flower, Figueroa and Exposition intersections Vs how many cars and pedestrians pass the Farmdale and Exposition intersection. One has to separate the scare mongering from the facts when it comes to neighborhood activist and what their agenda really is.

This past New Year’s Eve, Manhattan witnessed a second hotspot of frenetic plastic sunglass and top hat-clad citygoers in addition to the 12-hour long bash at Times Square. Barely 10 blocks south of the world’s most famous bejeweled ball, “the world’s most famous arena” was abuzz with something much larger than an ordinary Knicks or Rangers game.
Outside Madison Square Garden, a mix of people more eclectic than the area’s usual inhabitants, darkly dressed commuters hurrying to Penn Station, flocked to the angular arena like lemmings: barely 21-year-olds in sequined mini dresses, couples ranging from conservative to ghetto-fabulous and families that looked like they wound up in Manhattan via the Midwest.
All were there to watch a singer whose multi-syllable name is instantly associated with unprecedented success, chart-topping record sales and inexplicably devoted listeners that span decades in age and continents in race.
As the ambiguously named and even more ambiguous-looking Lady Gaga released her second album last November and jump-started a worldwide tour shortly thereafter, one would naturally expect me to reveal the mystical Stefani Germanotta as the focal point of the evening.
But instead, I’m kickin’ it old school: Mariah Carey.
Carey’s Dec. 31 performance — the opening date of her “Angels Advocate” tour, which supports Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, her 12th studio album that was released last September — marked a homecoming for the Long Island native.
What Carey delivered, however, was not an over-the-top display fit for a Homecoming Queen one might expect, but more a fairly haphazard exhibition of a pop diva whose body of work generates her hype.
On the verge of turning 41, Carey is the oldest consistently working female artist in pop and R&B, churning out albums year after year that more often than not produce Billboard 100 hits and sell-out stadiums — call her the Meryl Streep of popular music.
But much like the film industry, the pop music circuit is not so open and friendly to females — or anyone, for that matter — past the age of 25. So how has Carey — who according to the Nielsen SoundScan is the best-selling female artist in the U.S. and has the most No. 1 singles for a solo artist — managed to hold her place at the top despite a mental breakdown in 2001, a horrendous performance in the kind-of-based-on-real-life film (Glitter) and several poorly reviewed records?
After beginning her New Year’s Eve show singing “All I Want For Christmas Is You” from an old-fashioned sleigh suspended above the arena floor, slowing it down with the hauntingly raw “H.A.T.E. U” and, much later, bringing in the shamelessly provocative “Touch My Body,” Carey’s appeal becomes a bit more clear.
With a minimal set design, a modest-sized group of dancers performing choreography that harkens back to the era of In Living Color’s Fly Girls and a closet’s worth of tasteful gowns and mini dresses, Carey’s performance was about restraint.
As my concert date said to me moments before the show began, Carey is one of the only pop stars not known for her dance moves — save for her trademark zig-zagging of the hand. Nor is she known for her theatrics, instead replacing pop music’s pyrotechnics and extravagant set changes with a spiraling vocal range and emotionally charged lyrics.
And though she underwhelmed at times — lip-syncing as if without a care through “Make It Happen” and “Obsessed” — Carey’s finest moment of the night came at the show’s end, minutes after she downed a glass of champagne with husband Nick Cannon at midnight.
It’s undeniable that 2009 was the year popular music went burlesque: From the most mainstream pop stars to obscure indie songstresses, the 20-something vocally-inclined females currently reclaiming the music industry staged Broadway-worthy productions that have taken live performances to an otherworldly level.
Britney Spears nearly flashed it all on her attempted comeback tour, “The Circus;” Bat for Lashes adorned her stage with Jesus figurines and images of animals; Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine made it a point to fill her sets with video projections and one eccentric costume after the other. But after her catchy synth-driven hits, “Poker Face” and “Bad Romance,” and the debut of her kitschy Kermit the Frog gown, Lady Gaga has undoubtedly become the epitome of spectacle — a trait that drives her career more than her racing beats and gauzy synth-lines.
Carey, too, can be somewhat of a spectacle. A quick Google search and first-listen of her tipsy stream of conscious speech on Jan. 5 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival — where she accepted an award for best breakthrough performance for her turn as a mustached social worker in Precious, Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire — is proof that in her personal life, Carey’s a bit unhinged.
Yet only Carey can have The New York Times deeming her in a recent headline a “Pop Star in Her Own Time Zone.” Only Carey can celebrate the New Year almost a minute after the fact — and convince a stadium of 20,000 concertgoers that their iPhones were falsely set and her countdown was accurate. And only Carey can enchant those 20,000 and make them oblivious to the lip syncing, multiple spots of onstage disarray and lack of the 90s tunes that cultivated her fame.
If Lady Gaga were to play Madison Square Garden on New Year’s Eve, the spectacle wouldn’t have amounted to much more than balloons and confetti exploding over the arena at midnight.
But for both Mariah Carey and her music — acceptance speeches aside — less has always been more.

As health care continues to take center stage on Capitol Hill and across the country, students and professionals from the Keck School of Medicine traveled to Sacramento this weekend to lobby for single-payer health care.
Hosted by the California Health Professional Student Alliance, Lobby Day 2010 served as a venue for more than 500 medical students and professionals to appeal to state legislators in hopes of gaining support for a statewide, single-payer health care bill.
The USC group California Student Physicians for Healthcare Reform helped spread the word about Lobby Day and recruited nearly 50 Keck students and professionals who are passionate about single-payer health care.
“For me it was attractive to get started and learn about how I can make an impact in health care and in California,” said Kristen Gregory, a second-year medical student and co-president of CSPHR.
More than 450 people attended the lobby day, according to Chris Scannell, Lobby Day chair and a fourth-year Ph.D. medical student at Keck.
On the first day of the conference, participants were trained on the issue and ways to approach it with legislators. Then, participants spent the second day speaking with legislators after a rally that drew as many as 1,000 people.
Scannell said the group was hoping to engage legislators — particularly those with Republican affiliations — to generate discussion in advance of a key vote on the billing slated for later this week.
The bill, known as SB 810 or the California Universal Healthcare Act, would create a public agency to provide every resident of California with health insurance through a single-payer health care system.
The single-payer SB 810 bill has passed through the California legislature twice before but was vetoed twice by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
“In the past, it’s been divided along strict party lines,” Scannell said. “It seems like [this time] they were willing to talk about it.”
Scannell said many opponents of the bill are concerned about the costs of implementing a single-payer health care system.
“You raise taxes in order to implement this, but that’s the case with any type of social program you enact in the beginning,” he said.
Some citizens and lawmakers are also against increasing government involvement in health care, Scannell said, but he and others who participated in the Student Lobby Day argued that health care is one of few public services that remains privatized.
“We already have police, fire, postal  services … These are all sources we rely on and we would never think of privatizing them and I think health care’s the same,” he said.
In light of the upcoming governor’s race, students who attended Lobby Day are hopeful the bill will eventually pass and take effect, according to Scannell.
“This will be kind of a changing of the guard with the new governor election … It’s important that we’re [at Lobby Day] again this year to show support for it,” Scannell said.
Aaron Case, a second-year medical student and CSPHR member said he felt the event was an effective way to reach out to legislators and have an impact.
“I went in there and told my story about how I was a poor, struggling musician without health insurance. I was scared about it most of the time,” Case said.
Case said he has been able to convince legislators to back the bill in the past, and he hopes Lobby Day will continue to garner support in the future.
“This is the first time I felt like I was actually talking to somebody who was going to be able to do something about this,” he said.
Thanks for the “raising of awareness”, guys.  And thanks for going, Case, even though you don’t have insurance yourself.  That’s what motivated me to (almost) go.  Imagine having a wife to deal with, as well!  USA is the only developed country where so many are uninsured!
[Aaron Case, a second-year medical student and CSPHR member … “I went in there and told my story about how I was a poor, struggling musician without health insurance…,” Case said.]
Typical liberals! It’s lying, but that’s OK because it serves the interests of power…
What makes you think he’s lying? Did you ever think that perhaps before he entered medical school, he was a poor, struggling musician without health insurance. 46 million people in the country do not have health insurance. There is no need to lie to exacerbate an already significant problem. Perhaps you need to learn the lesson of how Assuming only makes an “Ass” out of “u” and “me.”

The opening of the doors at the Von KleinSmid Center Library Monday represented a huge victory for the students and faculty members who rely on the library’s specialized collection.
In late November, Catherine Quinlan, dean of the USC libraries, announced that the VKC Library would be closed and converted into music practice rooms, citing space considerations. The current music practice facility is slated for demolition and administrators chose the VKC Library as the new destination, thinking they could easily redistribute the library’s resources to  the Doheny Memorial Library and other university libraries.

But within a week of the announcement the university reversed its decision, leaving the library intact. The fate of the music practice rooms, however, remains uncertain.
“The unresolved issue is the school of music still needs to find a space for the [Music Practice and Instruction Center] building because it’s being torn down to accommodate an athletic training facility,” said Dr. Robert Labaree, head of the VKC Library.
Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta said the Music Practice and Instruction Center is no longer effectively serving the needs of Thornton’s students.
“The practice rooms are the core, the heartbeat, of a school of music because the students use them so much, so it should be a nice facility for them,” Cutietta said. “If we are going to stay in that building, it needs major renovations, and we would rather move.”
The PIC building, which borders Cromwell Field, the Howard Jones Practice Field, the intramural field and Heritage Hall, has been on the demolition list for a long time, according to Rob Cooper, vice provost for planning and budget.
Though relocating to the VKC Library would have been a better situation for Thornton, Cutietta said the situation was still not ideal. He added that he was not surprised when the administration later reversed its plans.
The November announcement immediately spurred resistance from staff and students, who began mobilizing efforts to petition the closure.
“There was just a huge eruption of anger over the decision,” Labaree said. “There was a broad spectrum of constituents who rose up in protest in relocating our materials and our personnel.”
Tim McNally, a senior majoring in international relations,  launched the Save VKC Library website. The International Relations Undergraduate Association and Model United Nations team were involved in petitioning the university’s initial decision, McNally said. The groups soon gathered more than 1,000 signatures.
“USC is a school that is very concerned with its reputation, and it doesn’t look good for a major school to be shutting down one of the best IR libraries in the world to build music practice rooms,” McNally said.
Lindsay Patin, co-president of IRUA and a sophomore majoring in international relations and economics, said converting the VKC Library into music practices rooms was a “misallocation of space.”
“The administration could see that it is a decision that affects a lot of people in a negative way,” Patin said.
Ultimately, the student petitions and protests might have helped drive the administration to backtrack on its initial decision.
“The students felt at home in that location,” Quinlan said. “While we would have tried really hard to make sure they had their resources and services close to them, the idea of having a space that they really felt was a part of their community was important to the students.”
Professors also protested the move. John Odell, director of the School of International Relations, wrote a letter to the university librarian expressing his discontent with the initial decision.
“Our problem was the decision was made without affecting the academic mission of the university without consulting the academics, the faculty who use the library and who teach students how to use it, or of course, consulting the students either,” Odell said.
But Cooper said student and faculty reaction did not play a role in reversing the decision.
“Upon further analysis of the space, it did not meet the needs of the university for the practice rooms,” Cooper said.
The decision was officially retracted on Nov. 23 in an announcement from Sue Lewis, associate vice provost for planning and design.
“The library’s faculty, staff, collections and users can not be sufficiently accommodated in the spaces available in Doheny and 3434 Grand,” the memo read. “The VKC Library is not ideal for the uses to which it was to be put for the students of the Thornton School of Music.”
The administration is now considering new locations for the practice rooms, though Cooper would not discuss the possibilities at this time.
Cutietta said he was unaware of any alternative locations being considered right now.
Odell said he believed the university made the right decision in the end, though concerns still remain.
“The decision to keep the library intact was certainly the right decision, but I’m also concerned about the problem at the music school,” Odell said. “They do need a solution.”

Cheering loudly for 2010 wasn’t just a way to welcome a new decade. It was also a way to try and rinse the bitter flavor of 2009 from  our mouths. Much like the H1N1 virus, last year’s grievances stubbornly remain floating in the air. After taking the vaccine and putting the past behind us, we celebrated the arrival of the new year, hopeful for some positive change. The new year may be a chance for some redemption, but the aftermath of 2009 certainly isn’t making any of the work easy.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
The year passed by like a slideshow of sensationalisms and embarrassments: celebrity deaths all around, Miss California’s dismissal, the White House party crashers, Tiger Woods. The despairs over the economy aren’t even close to subsiding anytime soon. And politically, we got hit with Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s impeachment,  Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s resignation and “going rogue,” along with President Barack Obama’s questionable Nobel Peace Prize award.
I could fit an apt definition of 2009 way under Twitter’s 140-character limit: one big disappointment.
From Obama’s inauguration in the beginning of the year, we should have known the “promised change” couldn’t have come about in just a year. The social unrest and impatience was obvious, however, from the social blunders that littered the news all too often this year.
Attention grabbers like Octomom and the Balloon Boy made us shake our heads with “what were they thinking?” on our minds while outbursts by Kanye West and South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson made us realize that celebrities and politicians felt the sting of stress too, albeit with a significant and questionable amount of media coverage. The troubles remained strong even through the end of 2009, going out with the shooting at Fort Hood and the attempted terrorist attack by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.
I’d like to say we should look past these things and hope for a better year, but the hardships left by 2009 are just too bleak.
The year left sour notes for USC as well, with the fatal hit-and-run in March, President Steven B. Sample announcing his retirement and star running back Stafon Johnson’s injury.
The construction of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the interactions between major groups among the USC student body, such as the Greek, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender and Interfaith communities were (and remain) important issues that require careful consideration. It isn’t clear yet how USC will get by in 2010, but if the controversial sanctions on the basketball team and Pete Carroll departure for Seattle hitting the front pages are signs, things aren’t going to be easy.
In fact, from 9/11 to the Bush administration to the economy going down the drain, the past decade as a whole left challenge after challenge for the new decade to deal with. It was impossible for the Obama administration to solve that entire mess within a year, and by 2010 that pile has barely been lessened. Many of 2009’s frustrations stemmed from a chaotic inheritance of problems from earlier, and the end of 2009 should remind us of the importance of prioritizing the work ahead.
As a society, we must look back at events like the Balloon Boy hoax and the incident at Fort Hood and think about the cultural implications surrounding them. News stories of violence and scandals like these that were all too common in 2009 pointed out a sense of anxiety that Americans grew all too familiar with. It was a culture of panic with the sinking economy, H1N1 pandemic, and the attempted terrorist attack. Everyone was on edge during 2009; in 2010 we must address that tension with the resolve to work smarter, not harder.
On campus, 2010 should be marked by a close monitoring of the selection of President Sample’s successor, especially with its potential effects on our school’s budgets, politics and community benefits. The university must foster synergy between its respective parts, encouraging discussion and cooperative efforts in order to succeed in this new decade. And those efforts start with the individual.
Personal responsibility will be key to turning away from the embarrassments of 2009 and building a better 2010.

The holidays are over.
The tree is packed up, the pretty lights cleared away and Santa’s cookies are long gone. One thing still remains, however: The excess weight gained after a full month of indulgence. No wonder there are so many New Year resolutions to lose weight or eat healthier after the holiday season.
Au naturale · Babycakes NYC’s gluten-free carrot cupcake (top) and vegan, agave-sweetened cinnamon buns (bottom) are just a few of the shop’s tailored items. The bakery recently opened a location in Los Angeles. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
Unfortunately, those resolutions fall short, because ­— try as we might — there is still nothing as comforting and satisfying as a decadent cupcake or chewy chocolate brownie.
Perhaps with this in mind, Babycakes NYC — a vegan bakery — opened a location in Downtown Los Angeles just three days after the New Year, offering hope for resolution-makers citywide with the promise that you actually can have your cake and eat it too.
Babycakes NYC first opened in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, providing those with certain allergies or nitpicky diets a bountiful array of sweet treats that are all-natural, organic, gluten-free, sugar-free, Kosher and vegan.
Setting its treats apart from others starts with the ingredients. The bakery uses agave nectar, an all-natural, low-glycemic sweetener derived from cactus, to sweeten most of its concoctions and uses only canola and cold-pressed virgin coconut oil in place of necessary fats. Rice flour or a garbanzo bean mix is used for Babycakes NYC’s popular gluten-free options and the coconut oil is unrefined and non-hydrogenated, boosting its health benefits.
If all that information made your head spin, you are probably only concerned with one key question: “Do they even taste good?”
The spelt carrot cupcake is small and sweet, but packed with flavor and spice. It comes layered with the perfect amount of sweet vanilla frosting, and the visible flakes of grated carrots within the cake guarantee that all the ingredients are fresh and real.
The agave-sweetened brownie is the size and shape of a mini-cupcake, with a tiny dollop of melted chocolate on top. It is altogether rich, dark and intense, satisfying every sinful chocolate craving in one luscious bite.
Surprisingly, also on the savory side is the gluten-free vegan cornbread. Soy-free and agave-sweetened, it is a dense, golden slice of cake that is both crumbly and crunchy. The bread is full of its namesake vegetable, with flecks of corn grits making for a very interesting and delicious contrast in textures.
The baked goods they sell are truly delicious and you would never have guessed it was dairy, egg and sugar-free. They are certainly better than cakes that are baked from a mix or packaged brownies bought from a grocery store, but the real reason behind the Babycakes NYC hype is simply the wonder that something that sounds like a chemical experiment can taste so familiarly good.
Unfortunately, as with all health products, every goodie sold in Babycakes NYC comes with a hefty price tag. The cupcakes, smaller than a fist, are $3.25-$4.25 each. A single chocolate chip cookie, which is only about two inches wide and a quarter of an inch thick, is $1.50. A cookie sandwich bumps up to $5. The cornbread, sold by the one-inch slice, is $3.50. Add a cookie, a cupcake and a brownie here and there and prices add up before you know it.
So is Babycakes NYC worth the trip? A single little cupcake may be out of many students’ price range, but the satisfaction of meeting your sweet cravings while sticking to your New Year health goals might be worth it.

With only five seconds remaining, the Women of Troy and the California Golden Bears were deadlocked at 64.
That left more than enough time for sophomore guard Ashley Corral to will her team to victory.
Clutch - Corral scored 18 points in USC’s bounce-back win Sunday. - Daily Trojan | Tim Tran
After dribbling through pressure defense by the Golden Bears, Corral banked in a three-point shot with just over a second left to cap a come-from-behind victory at the Galen Center Sunday afternoon.
“It’s a big win, especially at home,” Corral said. “We knew we needed to come out here and win especially after our loss against Stanford,”
The Women of Troy overcame strong performances by Cal center DeNesha Stallworth and Cal guard Alexis Gray-Lawson, who scored 30 points and 20 points, respectively.
Meanwhile, it was sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath and Corral who came through in the clutch for the Women of Troy. Both players combined for the final seven points in the last minute of play.
Gilbreath led a balanced attack for the Women of Troy, scoring 19 points, while Corral chipped in 18 points, and two others reached double figures.
“I’m very pleased,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We’re a young team, we’re playing hard.”
The Women of Troy opened the game strong, matching the Golden Bears play. As the first half wore on, they struggled offensively from the field and struggled to rebound the ball defensively.
Both Stallworth and Gray-Lawson posed all sorts of problems for the Women of Troy. With Stallworth controlling the inside and Gray-Lawson breaking down the defense, they found themselves trailing 37-27 at halftime.
The start of the second half, however, saw the Women of Troy switch up defenses, which flustered the Golden Bears on offense. Turnovers led to easy baskets and the Women of Troy slowly cut into the halftime deficit.
The second half proved to be a seesaw battle as both teams exchanged leads numerous times.
With almost five minutes remaining in the contest, the Women of Troy trailed 59-54. But two free throws and two field goals later by the Women of Troy, the Golden Bears saw themselves trailing by a single point at 60-59.  
Cal regained the lead yet again on a basket by Gray-Lawson but Gilbreath put the Women of Troy up 62-61 by sinking two free throws on their next possession.
The Golden Bears failed to convert and regain the lead and were forced to foul. Gilbreath calmly sank two more free throws, putting the Women of Troy ahead by three.
After a timeout, Gray-Lawson then managed to sink a three pointer to tie the score at 64.
But any hope at overtime for the Golden Bears was diminished when Corral provided the late game heroics that gave the Women of Troy a 3-1 record in conference play.
“[This game] definitely means a lot. Before even starting conference play, we figured Stanford, Cal and Arizona State were some of the teams we’d have to compete with. We’ve beaten two out of the three now. It shows we’re on the rise and we’re a team to contend with,” Cooper said.
The Women of Troy host crosstown rival UCLA next Sunday at 2:30 p.m.

Suddenly the hottest team on the West Coast isn’t so hot anymore.
USC kept it close for most of the night and led 50-43 with just under 10 minutes left to play, but California clawed back for a 67-59 victory Saturday at Haas Pavilion. After putting together an eight-game winning streak — and opening eyes around the country — the Trojans have cooled off in their last two contests, their loss to the Bears coming just three days after a 54-53 defeat at Stanford.
Sloppy - Senior guard Dwight Lewis’s mistakes proved costly. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan
Sloppy play and missed shots haunted the Trojans down the stretch, even as Cal grabbed control and went on a 24-9 run to close the game.
Senior guard Dwight Lewis scored 20 points for USC (10-6, 2-2 Pac-10), but he also made two costly mistakes in the final four minutes. He turned the ball over when he committed a traveling violation, then missed badly on a twisting layup that would have cut the Bears’ lead to four.
Redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson added 12 points and sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic added 11, but the Trojans received little production from the rest of their team. Redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity, USC’s usually reliable playmaker, finished with no assists and shot just two of eight from the field.
California guard Jerome Randle led all scorers with 21 points. The Bears (10-5, 2-1) also got 20 points from forward Theo Robertson.
Until a free throw by Randle made it 63-53 with 44 seconds left, neither team had been able to build much of a lead. The Bears jumped out to an 11-4 advantage in the first half but traded baskets with USC for most of the game.
The difference came at the free-throw line, where the Bears finished 21 of 24. Meanwhile, the Trojans made just three trips to the stripe and went three of five
The Trojans began their recent run with a 51-37 victory over Sacramento State on Dec. 8. The Trojans pulled off a major upset by defeating then-No. 9 Tennessee 77-55 before traveling to Honolulu for the Diamond Head Classic, where they knocked off a 20th-ranked UNLV squad in the final to claim the tournament title.
The team then began Pac-10 play on Dec. 31 with a 56-50 win against Arizona. Two days later, USC beat Arizona State in a 47-37 victory for the team’s first 2-0 conference start in three years.
But the surging Trojans came up against a major roadblock just hours after beating the Sun Devils. On Jan. 3, the university announced self-imposed sanctions on the men’s basketball program for NCAA rules violations involving ex-player O.J. Mayo.
The sanctions, which include a ban on postseason competition at the end of the season and a reduction of scholarships, put a serious damper on the Trojans’ unexpected run. USC also vacated all wins during the 2007-2008 season.

1. Phoenix – Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix
V2 Records
Released: May 26
Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix is the best kind of record, the kind that slowly, insidiously seeps into your head and then takes up residence there, refusing to leave. A grower, in short, but one that proves itself more than worthy of all the attention. It’s certainly not a record that will have you pondering the meaning of life — but it’s the painstaking attention to detail, the relentlessly innovative beats and polished drumming that catapult Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix into a realm of its own. The appealingly earnest way these Frenchmen take English rock ‘n’ roll and make it their own, make Phoenix’s latest a dance record that isn’t afraid to celebrate its own flaws, rejoice in its ability to take a shallow genre and make something more lasting — an album that speaks as much to a person’s emotions as it does their feet. Here’s to the record of the year.
2. Florence and the Machine – Lungs
Island
Released: July 6
With a voice that runs from fierce to grieving to lusty, Florence Welch is the driving force behind Lungs, an album that whirls from furious to lovelorn to heartbroken with both the ease of a chameleon and the force of a banshee. Lungs is definitely the debut of the year, particularly when you realize how effortlessly the ferocious backing band has transcribed Welch’s rollercoaster of emotions into music.
3. Raekwon – Only Built For Cuban Linx II
EMI
Released: Sept. 8
Raekwon is clearly at the top of his game here, delivering a conceptual story that wallows in the dirt and grime of New York, but comes out reinvigorated in the end. It’s a shining mission statement for the start of a new year, devoid of any empty posturing or false bravado, once again establishing the Wu as a powerful force in hip-hop going into the new decade.
4. Miike Snow – Miike Snow
Downtown
Released: June 9
It’s a far cry for producing hits for Britney Spears, but Bloodyshy & Avant’s latest side project might be the best-produced album of the year. Flitting from Vampire Weekend-esque indie (“Animal”) to haunting atmospherics (“Silvia”) to filthy electro-pop (“Black & Blue”), Miike Snow’s self-titled release is an instant party starter. But at its heart, it’s something more — a multi-layered album built on a pop foundation that values superior songwriting over mindless hooks.
5. Japandroids – Post-Nothing
Polyvinyl
Released: Aug. 4
This record is full of undeniably vital simple guitar-and-drum anthems that are unapologetically bursting with life, energy, lust, and other sweeping emotions. Just turn the volume up loud and wallow in youth and its utter lack of restraint.
6. Monsters of Folk – Monsters of Folk
Shangri-La Music
Released: Sept. 22
Monsters of Folk’s self-titled debut ended up being more the product of a long-time band than a supergroup thrown together for awe factor which is a miracle in today’s world of ill-advised collaborations and ego-stroking supergroups. The famous foursome injects their own sounds seamlessly into the final product, a time capsule of classic 2000s Americana that manages to stand on its own, rather than the hodgepodge of styles one would expect.
7. Yeah Yeah Yeahs – It’s Blitz!
Interscope
Released: March 9
No longer can the Yeah Yeah Yeahs be accused of being just another one-dimensional New York garage rock band. Perhaps the group’s most complete effort yet, It’s Blitz! is a multifaceted album that reveals more and more upon each successive listen. It shows a startling amount of growth for a band long relegated to a stream of one-hit wonders and an leaves an exciting amount of anticipation for the band’s future.
8. Neko Case – Middle Cyclone
ANTI-
Released: March 3
The musicianship on Middle Cyclone, Case’s third solo record, is top-notch and runs the gamut from smoky folk to straight-ahead rock. Yet the focus remains, as always, on Case’s inimitable vocals. Opener “This Tornado Loves You” is proof of this and more, Case’s distinctive pipes highlighting a stormy mess of a song, and proving yet again that this lady and her formidable voice is practically a force of nature itself.
9. Taken By Trees – East of Eden
Rough Trade
Released: Sept. 8
Mixing in foreign tones and culture into a traditionally Western genre (in this case, happy-go-lucky Swedish pop) has typically come off as contrite or even insulting. Luckily for former Concretes’ frontwoman Victoria Bergsman, she seems to have sublimated all those Eastern influences into her own sound rather than just throwing in a few foreign instruments and styles. It’s a record that is almost impossible to place, the convergence of sounds and Bergsman’s own haunting vocals in a mystical, nearly timeless album.
10. The Decemberists – The Hazards of Love
Capitol Records
Released: March 24
Hazards of Love is the ultimate progression of the Decemberists’ sound, taking their penchant for wordy songs and long-winded stories and expanding it over the course of an entire album. And while there have been better Decemberists’ records and certainly better stories than the half-baked one Colin Meloy has created here, the music is vintage (read: awesome) Decemberists.
11. Mos Def – The Ecstatic
Downtown
Released: June 9
Maybe the comeback record of the year, The Ecstatic finds Mos Def sounding more rejuvenated and in tune with the superb production than he has in years. It helps, of course, that he still retains one of the most distinctive flows and ingenious rhymes in the game.
12. Lily Allen – It’s Not Me, It’s You 
Regal
Released: Feb. 9
While not as unique and defining as her debut, track after track on It’s Not Me, It’s You is a potential hit single, perhaps derailed from commercial success only by Allen’s often-blunt lyrics and Mark Ronson’s sometimes-offbeat production choices. Of course, that’s what makes the British fire-spit such a treat in the whitewashed world of mainstream pop.
13. Portugal. The Man – The Satanic Satanist
Equal Vision
Released: July 21
The Satanic Satanist is Portugal. The Man at their best — an amalgam of all their earlier records into a tasty melting pot of music that couldn’t sound more tossed-off or carefree if it tried. It’s hard to make a record that lasts while still retaining that light and relaxing touch, but Portugal. The Man make it look easy.
14. Animal Collective – Merriweather Post Pavilion
Domino
Released: Jan. 6
Perhaps the strangest success story of the year – after all, would anyone listening to Animal Collective in 2000 have predicted this level of success 10 years later? Animal Collective’s latest triumphs, however, lie in its ability to overcome its historical tendency to make music as thick as textbooks and broaden their pop horizons, resulting in a record that appealed to as many new fans as it satisfied their hardcore apologists.
15. Manchester Orchestra – Mean Everything To Nothing
Favorite Gentlemen
Released: April 21
It’s rare for a band’s sophomore effort to show such growth and no-holds-barred creativity, but Mean Everything To Nothing is just that and more. Singer and lyricist Andy Hull has sharpened his roiling emotions into some of the finest songwriting of the year (just check out “I Can Feel A Hot One”), and it seems like Manchester Orchestra has finally started to become the poet laureates of emotive indie rock that all their fans had hoped for.
16. The Fiery Furnaces – I’m Going Away
Thrill Jockey
Released: July 21
It’s been years since the Fiery Furnaces have been able to reconcile its experimental tendencies with the pop songwriting it’s capable of, but with I’m Going Away, the Fiery Furnaces have straddled those two opposite idioms with their most accessible record to date.
17.  Manic Street Preachers – Journal for Plague Lovers
Columbia
Released: May 18
The Preachers have finally escaped the ghost of former frontman Richey Edwards with this accessible slice of forward-thinking, mainstream rock ‘n roll. Journal for Plague Lovers is perhaps the closest the band has come to its masterpieces of the ‘90s, without coming off as a stale re-tread of what made them great.
18. Noah and the Whale – The First Days of Spring
Cherrytree Records
Released: Oct. 6
The First Days of Spring is quite an about-face from last year’s irrepressibly cheery debut, but London quintet Noah and the Whale pull it off without a hitch, composing a crushingly depressing breakup record that still manages to shine through on the strength of its songwriting.
19. M. Ward – Hold Time
Merge Records
Released: Feb. 17
Classic Americana done right, Hold Time is only the latest in a long line of excellent works by folk singer-songwriter M. Ward. A cohesive flow of sepia-toned images and stories told simply and effectively, usually only by Ward’s gravelly voice and rustic guitar.
20. Kiss Kiss – The Meek Shall Inherit What’s Left
Eyeball Records
Released: July 7
A wonderfully scrambled mess of an album, one that makes it clear that Kiss Kiss really have no idea what direction they’re heading in at any given time, but also that they’re going to have a hell of a lot of fun going there regardless.
didn’t like that grizzly bear album
Noah and the Whale, Florence and the Machine, and the Worst Decemberists album in 8 years over GRIZZLY BEAR?  Just a massive oversight on this list son.

Junior running back Joe McKnight came under fire over the winter break, as accusations of an illegal gift from a businessman, which would be an NCAA violation, became wide-spread.
Escaping pressure · While NCAA allegations swirled during winter recess, McKnight took the opportunity to declare his intent to enter the 2010 NFL Draft, forgoing his senior year of eligibility. - Daily Trojan | Brandon Hui
The Los Angeles Times ran an article just before Christmas that looked at McKnight’s use of a 2006 Land Rover that he had been seen driving. The vehicle allegedly belongs to a Santa Monica businessman, Scott Schenter, who works for the County Assessor’s office. Schenter also founded a company called USC Marketing in 2008, which he says stands for United States China Marketing and is not connected to the university.
Any use of this vehicle by McKnight as a benefit from a marketing representative, agents or anyone of that nature would be a violation of NCAA rules. Accordingly, the NCAA responded to the accusations by investigating the situation.
McKnight was even forced to sit out of the Trojan’s San Francisco Emerald Bowl game after he was deemed unable to play by USC’s compliance department.
Schenter has reached out to the media in defense of McKnight, saying he has “nothing to do with agents, marketing players or representing athletes,” and that he has no ties to USC, as he is a University of Washington fan.
Schenter continued to explain that the vehicle belongs to a young woman named Johana Michelle Beltran, McKnight’s girlfriend, and that he helped her purchase the vehicle because the Beltran family was having trouble getting qualified for a loan.
McKnight has denied driving the car, though a Times reporter has claimed to see him driving it more than one time.
While everyone’s focus has shifted from McKnight to the NCAA basketball sanctions and Pete Carroll’s decision to become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, McKnight announced his decision to enter the NFL draft and leave USC a year early.
“The time is right,” McKnight told ESPN. “This was my first healthy season and I really don’t want to come back and risk injury.”
The time may be right in terms of injury, but his decision also comes at a time where intense speculation follows him all over the USC campus. McKnight, however, explained that these ongoing investigations and allegations do not have an impact on the decision he has made, but that other factors, like the comparison to former Trojan Reggie Bush, have solidified his NFL verdict.
“If I would have come back it would have been to pursue the Heisman,” he said. “My career was OK. It was good, but not like Reggie. There was a constant pressure to be like Reggie.”
McKnight has more in common with Bush than he might have wanted after the allegations made by the Times last month. USC is already under investigation by the NCAA along with the Pac-10 about the accusations that Bush (and basketball star O.J. Mayo, as well) received improper benefits during their time at school.
McKnight’s decision to turn pro during this time in USC sports may be fortuitous, since, after Carroll’s resignation settled, the focus would have shifted back to McKnight.
[…] RB Joe McKnight made the decision to leave USC early, but he is still under intense fire for allegation of illegal gifts.  Hey, it’s USC, isn’t that the nature of the program? (Daily […]

2009. What a great year for movies — but not to hear the pundits tell it.
This past year was hastily branded as an “off year” in cinema, as if the absence of a glut of great films by established masters somehow consigns an entire year to mediocrity. While there were some disappointments in 2009, writing off the hundreds of films so simply would be a great mistake.
We eagerly awaited Clint Eastwood’s latest outing, Invictus, which somehow arrived as just the second-best film about South Africa of the year (after District 9, of course). And two years after There Will Be Blood, Daniel Day-Lewis finally turned up in Rob Marshall’s truly awful musical, Nine. Peter Jackson released The Lovely Bones to widespread critical scorn and Martin Scorsese’s highly anticipated Shutter Island postponed its release until February 2010.
2009 was not the year of epics or blockbusters. Nor was it the year that the Coen brothers competed with Paul Thomas Anderson for our utmost admiration. Instead, 2009 was the year of the great psychological portrait; many of the best films unearthed the deepest workings of the most fragile or closed-off minds. They looked into human relationships with horrifying clarity.
Best of all was The White Ribbon by Michael Haneke (Caché), cinema’s greatest psychologist. Haneke’s latest masterpiece peeled back the veneer of a small village in pre-World War I Germany to reveal wounds festering with envy, mistrust and hatred. Haneke’s film was ostensibly about conditions that might have led to the rise of fascism in Germany, but his thesis that nobody is innocent ­— especially children — resonated brilliantly in today’s world.
Critics referred to Jason Reitman’s excellent Up in the Air as the only film with the courage to really look at the American economy. While that is certainly true, Haneke’s film, in looking at the darkness of the human condition, was subtly just as relevant.
Still Walking, by the great Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda, also probed the depths of human relationships, particularly within one traditional, dysfunctional Japanese family. While Koreeda’s film lacked the devastating social implications of Haneke’s, the semi-autobiographical nature of the story gave it a personal gravitas all its own.
Kathryn Bigelow’s thrilling The Hurt Locker was another filmmaker’s examination of the mind of an unstable man — a bomb squad veteran on a long tour in Iraq. Bigelow’s film was, simply put, one of the most thrilling works of cinema of the decade: an action film built around an emotionally complex performance by Jeremy Renner.
Performance also helped define Tom Ford’s excellent first effort, A Single Man. Anyone who cried “style over substance” at Ford’s portrait of a depressed college professor (Colin Firth) contemplating suicide simply wasn’t watching the actors closely enough.
The slow-paced Police, Adjective, by Romanian director Corneliu Porumboiu, looked at a good-hearted cop ordered to bust a teenager on dubious drug charges. The officer, played by Dragos Bucur, spends most of the movie staking out the suspect before finally engaging his superiors in a thrilling and absurd verbal tussle over the nature of his job and the nature of language.
Three of the year’s best films came from Britain. Lone Scherfig’s An Education was a great storybook relationship with all the romance surgically removed to reveal the unfortunate mistakes of a brilliant 16-year-old girl who falls for a charming businessman. A lot of credit has been given to Carey Mulligan as the leading lady, and for once it really is more than hype.
Both Tom Hooper’s The Damned United and Armando Iannucci’s In the Loop were distinctly British comedies about what happens when several big personalities grind up against one another. Hooper’s film, about a soccer coach’s doomed tenure atop the country’s most popular club, easily beat Invictus as the year’s best sports movie.
And anchored by another of the year’s best performances — Peter Capaldi as a wonderfully foul-mouthed Scottish public servant — Iannucci’s vicious satire poked fun at the lead-up to the Iraq War with just enough realism to make it all frighteningly believable.
While many films were character-driven dramas, another noticeable trend of 2009 movies was the resurgence of animated movies, particularly those aimed at both adults and children. The strength of Pixar’s early year release, Up — and the simultaneous weaknesses of both Wes Anderson’s The Fantastic Mr. Fox and Spike Jonze’s Where the Wild Things Are — was it’s ability to lay on the median between the cinema of children and adults, appealing to both at the same time.
Up perfectly juggled cute, talking animals — Dug the dog is one of Pixar’s most memorable characters — with more mature moments, such as the utterly perfect montage of romance, loss and remorse that opens the film.
Like Ratatouille and The Incredibles in their respective years, Up was one of the most purely original films of 2009. Hopefully, Pixar will emerge from its upcoming run of sequels to create more new characters and worlds.
In a year when American animation trended toward maturity, leave it to the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki to come out with one of the decade’s purest children’s movies in Ponyo. Miyazaki’s ode to the world under the sea is his first film aimed almost entirely at children since My Neighbor Totoro in 1988.
Ironically, for all the nostalgia that Spike Jonze’s hipper-than-thou adaptation of Maurice Sendak’s classic story attempted to evoke, nothing could compare to entering the original world the children of Ponyo live in. Miyazaki’s film was not made for adults, but it had an almost unmatched power to appeal to the child in our psyches.
It would be impossible to end a survey of the year in film without a nod to James Cameron’s Avatar. Sad proof that a reported $250 million budget can’t buy a good screenplay, Cameron’s hopelessly derivative film was nonetheless wonderful visual candy more than worth the price of admission. As was true of past leaps forward in special effects technology, someone is going to apply Cameron’s wonderful visual innovations to a truly original narrative and make a new masterpiece.
Very little of the films that came behind a trail of hype met their expectations in 2009, but as with all years, there were also many unexpected surprises.

Winter break is over.
It’s sad, but it’s true. Now, it’s back to the daily grind of classes, homework, internships and jobs. 
It may not seem like it’s been that long since you’ve been on campus — in reality, it’s only been a few weeks. But in that short time, a lot has happened in the world of USC sports.
It’s sometimes hard to follow what’s been going on around USC when you’re not on campus.
However, this column might give you a chance to catch up quickly at the beginning of spring semester. With the huge quantity and varying range of stories that broke over break, from accusations of NCAA infractions to self-imposed sanctions, it was a hectic few weeks.
This might help clear up any questions you might still have.
The USC football team ended the 2009 regular season on a low note and had to play in a non-BCS bowl for the first time since 2001. Having to settle for the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco, the team was dealt another blow shortly before its Dec. 26 matchup against Boston College.
Junior running back Joe McKnight was reportedly observed violating NCAA rules by driving a SUV that did not belong to him. The vehicle was registered to a Santa Monica businessman who said he had nothing to do with marketing players or representing athletes. Still, the rule states that an NCAA student-athlete cannot accept extra benefits from anyone based on their athletic ability. The investigation is still in progress.
Although McKnight joined the team in San Francisco for practice, he was not cleared to play. Without its star running back, USC won its seventh bowl game under coach Pete Carroll. The Trojans defeated the Eagles 24-13 behind freshman quarterback Matt Barkley’s two touchdown passes and one rushing touchdown.
The win placed a positive note on an otherwise disappointing season.
With the football season over, the focus shifted to men’s basketball, where the Trojans were piecing together a surprisingly solid start to their season under new coach Kevin O’Neill. After losing three of its first five games, USC capped off an eight-game winning streak by defeating Arizona State on Jan. 2.
The following day, however, this feel-good story didn’t feel so good anymore.
On Jan. 3, USC implemented self-imposed sanctions on the men’s basketball program for violating NCAA rules with regards to O.J. Mayo’s involvement with booster Rodney Guillory during the 2007-2008 season.
Under the sanctions, the current team is banned from postseason competition, including the Pac-10 Conference basketball tournament, and the program will lose one scholarship for the next two academic years, among other penalties.
Is it fair that this team and this coach get punished for others’ wrongdoings? No.
But it was necessary.
The Trojans have lost two straight since the sanctions were announced.
But team suffered a bigger loss over break. On Jan. 5, Rory Markas, the voice of the team, was found dead at his Palmdale, Calif. home. He was 54.
“He was a consummate professional and a well-loved individual,” USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett said. “He’ll be a very difficult person to replace.”
The following day, USC alum Randy Johnson, arguably the most dominating left-handed pitcher to every play Major League Baseball, retired from the sport. He finished his career with five Cy Young Awards, 303 wins and 4,875 strike outs, second on the all-time list behind Nolan Ryan.
As winter recess came to a close, the news shifted back to the football team.
First, it was redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams and McKnight declaring to opt for the NFL draft next season. Williams, the team’s MVP last season, and McKnight will leave gaping holes for the team to fill.
Also, backup quarterback Aaron Corp transferred to Richmond.
Although USC’s offense will be filled with new faces next season, the team recently discovered it has bigger shoes to fill.
In the words of Pete Carroll himself, “It came out of nowhere.”
Yes, Carroll is leaving.
Yes, that means no more “Big Balls Pete” chants.
And yes, I am bitter just like you.
It was a day I thought I’d never see, especially during my time here at USC, but Carroll’s tenure coaching the Trojans is over.
He leaves behind a remarkable legacy that will be tough for any coach to follow. And he leaves it all behind to coach the Seattle Seahawks next season. The deal was made official Monday.
While everyone in USC land probably knew of Carroll’s departure, maybe some of the other stories that occurred over break didn’t catch your attention.
But now that you’re all caught up, let the semester begin.

Pete Carroll popularized the philosophies of “win forever” and “always compete” at USC.
But the mantras that made him a college football legend also became the driving force behind his decision to coach in the NFL.
Legacy left · After finishing his first season with USC 6-6, Carroll compiled a 91-13 record over the next eight seasons at USC. - Daily Trojan | Timothy Tran
The 58-year-old agreed Monday to become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, confirming reports that persisted throughout the weekend that he would leave USC after nine years to return to the NFL. Carroll cited his view that his new position was “a challenge too good to pass up” as the determining factor in his decision.
He signed a five-year contract reportedly worth almost $33 million and will also be the team’s vice president of football operations.
A reflective Carroll used his last press conference at the university to thank USC players, coaches and fans for their support. Carroll said he would wait until today, when he is to be introduced in Seattle, to speak about what lies ahead in his new job.
“These are the most cherished times of my life,” Carroll said. “I do not expect to be able to top what we did in terms of these years together.”
Although the NFL provided a constant allure for Carroll, he said he believed he would remain at USC “forever.” It was not until Seahawks owner Paul Allen and chief executive operator Tod Leiweke presented him with what he called “the challenge of a lifetime” that he shifted his focus toward coaching in the professional ranks.
“It hurts to separate right now,” Carroll said. “I know that our fans want to know why it can’t keep on going. It can’t keep on going because of this opportunity that just came up.”
Carroll brushed aside claims that his departure was related to the NCAA’s investigation of USC’s athletic department or a rumored fractured relationship with Athletic Director Mike Garrett.
“It has nothing to do with anything that’s happened or taken place here,” Carroll said. “Mike Garrett and I have gone shoulder-to-shoulder on this thing for years.”
Despite finalizing a deal on Sunday night, Carroll still had to meet with players on Monday afternoon to confirm what many of them already knew. The room went “dead silent” upon Carroll’s entrance, freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said.
“There’s mixed feelings,” Barkley said. “But overall, I think he left us on a good note.”
Redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford said that he originally planned not to attend the meeting but changed his mind and held a players-only meeting. Bradford said he didn’t begrudge Carroll for leaving.
“It’s business, so you do what you have to do,” he said. “But we’re going to miss him a lot.”
Carroll refused to verify which assistant coaches he would bring with him to Seattle, but offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates, linebackers coach Ken Norton Jr. and offensive line coach Pat Ruel are all expected to join his NFL staff.
Daily Trojan | Mike Lee
Carroll’s sudden exit leaves the Trojans scrambling to find a new head coach. With less than three weeks before high school seniors commit on national signing day, USC’s next coach will have to salvage what remains of a once-promising recruiting class.
With Carroll officially gone, USC is already on the clock to find its new leader.
Oregon State coach Mike Riley signed a three-year extension Sunday to keep him in Corvallis, Ore. through 2019. The former USC offensive coordinator was reportedly one of the school’s leading candidates to take over for Carroll.
Jacksonville Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio is among the candidates believed to be on the short list of possible replacements.
USC President Steven B. Sample expressed both his regret for Carroll leaving and his gratitude to the coach for his work at USC.
“I had hoped this day would not come; this is a big loss to all of us,” Sample said in a press release. “But we are proud of Pete Carroll — and proud that the Seattle Seahawks recognize his talents and his accomplishments — and are offering him this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
Seattle will be Carroll’s third stop as an NFL coach. He went  33-31 over four years — one with the New York Jets and three with the New England Patriots.
Carroll’s departure ends a nearly decade-long run that was one of the most prosperous stretches in the school’s athletic history. In his nine years at USC, Carroll went 97-19 and won two national championships and seven Pac-10 conference championships.
Carroll also became synonymous with USC and Los Angeles for his work off the field. He said his philanthropic work with A Better L.A., a non-profit group focused on helping reduce gang violence within the city, would be uninterrupted by his new job.
The bigger question is will Mike Garrett be replaced as Pres. Sample’s last act? UCLA has replaced AD’s for far less than what has transpired at ‘SC. Garrett should go, when all the facts are in. He should do it voluntarily. USC is far bigger than all these cretins and rule breakers and coaches. Fight On. After all, it’s just sports people, hardly the stuff of real life that truly matters. Life goes on. USC clearly rises above these people and programs.
Trojan supporters,
The Guillotine is about to drop and everyone has jumped or is jumping ship. First Tim Floyd left town before the facts regarding multiple, not one, payments to OJ Mayo and his family and other infractions were revealed.
OJ Mayo was one and done, he did not care about illegal payments, and the NCAA now knows the details.
The NCAA sanction will be stiffer than the self-imposed sanction.
If the football program is found guilty of not properly overseeing its athletes, ignoring rumors of illegal payments and activity (i.e. Mcknight and the Range Rover issue), and the ongoing Reggie Bush saga, this could mean an even harsher penalty for both the football program and possibly the whole athletic dept.
Time will tell.
Pete Carroll knows this, McKnight knows, Mayo knew, and Floyd knew.. It is a shame that the remaining coaches and athletes will be punished for crimes committed by others, people who are now gone or soon to be gone.
Prepare for the Guillotine, the blades are being sharpened.
