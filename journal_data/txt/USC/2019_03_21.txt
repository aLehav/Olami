The No. 11 USC men’s volleyball will face off against No. 1 Long Beach State this Saturday night in USC’s North Gym. 
USC has lost its last four meetings with Long Beach State, including a 3-1 loss in January. Until last week when Long Beach played UC Santa Barbara, USC had been the only team to take a set off the 49ers. 
“I think we found our identity and the way we play,” senior outside hitter Ryan Moss said. “We’re in the final sprint here. I think on a mental standpoint and mindset we’re all on the same page — we know what needs to be done, and we know what we’re capable of. I think the whole team is just in a good space where we know that every night we need to come out and play our absolute best to show what we can do and try to build on that moving forward.”
Moss and redshirt senior outside hitter Jack Wyett are leading the Trojan offense with 249 and 231 total kills, respectively. Senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso has served up 16 aces so far this season. Moss and sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis anchor the defense with 42 and 40 blocks, respectively, while senior libero Matt Douglas has 107 digs in the back row. 
The 49ers are a force in serving with both senior opposite/outside hitter Kyle Ensing and senior outside hitter TJ DeFalco putting up 33 aces this season. Ensing and DeFalco also lead the team in kills with 213 and 205, respectively. On defense, Jordan Molina has 113 digs and Nick Amado has 52 blocks. 
This is Moss’ last chance to face players who he’s been competing with since middle school. 
“I’ve been playing against these guys since seventh, eighth grade so it’s been a long time coming,” Moss said. “I’m really excited for the opportunity to get to play them as No. 1 in the nation. They’re doing really well.”
Moss reflected on his time playing for USC and is happy with his experience on the team. 
“I think my goals have shifted throughout my years here,” Moss said. “We’ve suffered a lot of losses and we’ve had some terrible seasons in the past. So at a certain point, my goals shifted from winning national championships and all that stuff to just leaving the program in a better place than I found it.”
He acknowledges USC is at .500 in conference play, but remains realistic about what he can do with the time he has left to lead the team.
“I think this season is definitely a step in the right direction, and I personally am just trying to get everything out of myself as I can this last month of the season,” he said. “So, did I accomplish everything I set out to? I’m not too sure, but I’m happy with where we are right now.”
The match against the defending national champions begins in USC’s North Gym Saturday at 7 p.m.

The college admissions bribery scandal has sparked widespread controversy and dominated headlines nationwide. The indictments and accusations involve numerous prestigious universities and has forever altered the college admissions game. While the methods these parents and students used are obviously devious, key changes could have prevented corruption and could halt similar efforts in the future. Universities need to establish higher academic standards for student-athletes and check the power of those in charge of athlete admissions.
It’s imperative to first recognize the magnitude of the problem facing college athletics. Nationwide, universities have granted special treatment to student-athletes by setting lower academic standards for admission. The Atlantic reported that a court analysis of Harvard University’s 2000-2019 admission data revealed that athletes received significant academic accommodations such as lower GPA and test scores when student-athletes’ applications were reviewed. The document shows that Harvard ranked applicants on a six-point scale based on academic qualifications, and that athletes with a score of four were accepted at a rate of 70 percent while their non-athletic counterparts with the same scores were admitted at a rate of 0.076 percent. 
Moving forward, universities need to augment their qualifications and hold athletes to a higher standard of academics to ensure that scandals like this don’t occur again. GPA requirements and standardized test scores should be relatively similar for all applicants across the board. Universities need to close the gap between the academic achievements of athletes and other students to make sure no one holds an unfair academic advantage.
Despite the inequality of admissions between athletes and non-athletes, it’s important to note that athletic achievement is a legitimate factor for assessing a prospective student’s merit for admission. Athletic talents should be encouraged, as they promote diversity within the student body and cultivate school spirit. However, student-athletes should not be prioritized at the expense of significant equities between students. Academics for students at USC are highly regarded, and athletes are no exception to this — there shouldn’t be excess leniency.
Weighing athletics above academics when admitting students wrongfully allows people like businessman Rick Singer, who was accused of running the student-athlete recruitment scam, and the involved coaches to manipulate and abuse the process. Singer encouraged clients to take advantage of the low academic bar for athletes. From 2014 to 2018, he directed payments totaling $1.3 million in bribes to former associate athletics director Donna Heinel, who was terminated last week, to accept fake athletic recruits. By streamlining this process and virtually guaranteeing students admission, Singer capitalized off of the fact that athletes are given easier consideration.
There are various talents beyond athletics that promote diversity and benefit the student community — including marching band, chess and robotics to name a few — but none are treated as leniently as athletic talent in the admissions process. The Spirit of Troy, for example, comprises more than 300 students and is an essential component of USC sporting events. Such intensive extracurriculars are not granted the accommodations that athletes receive for displaying an equally noteworthy talent. And these students are spending just as much, or debatably even more, time and effort in developing their talents as athletes are. These disparities in treatment should not exist, and all students need to be held to the same academic requirements and standards.
Some may argue athletics benefit the University by generating revenue and fostering school spirit and that talents such as chess or robotics do little in comparison. However, every student contributes differently to the success of the academic institution — whether they are pioneering new medical treatments, breaking athletic records or maintaining strong grades while working full time. To this point, universities shouldn’t lower academic standards for athletes in attempt to bolster revenue yielded by sports like basketball and football. Universities must understand that while the desire to increase school spirit is necessary, it cannot be done at the expense of academic integrity — the foremost goal of an academic institution.
Most importantly, let’s not forget the crime that parents and students committed to dupe the system in this bribery admissions scandal. In many cases, the student was recruited to the school for a specific sport but never played once admitted. In one case, a student’s high school didn’t even offer the sport that the student claimed to play there. Reflecting negligent administrative oversight, no actions were taken to hold athletic recruits accountable and that has to change. 
Universities need to monitor an athlete’s path once they are admitted to ensure their integrity. While special cases like injury can excuse athletes from play, students should not be allowed to take spots from more qualified applicants if they aren’t going to continue in the sport they were recruited for. While Brown University was not affected by the admissions scandal, there is evidence that some athletes will not continue their sport to the end of their college career. According to The Brown Daily Herald, 30 percent of athletes at Brown choose to quit their sport some time before their senior year. Just like how applying to a university with an easier major only to transfer into a highly selective major is frowned upon, athletes should not be allowed to use this method to bypass the rigorous admissions standards. 
Nothing can change the sheer amount of injustice caused by the bribery scheme; however, universities can improve the process of athletic admissions. Holding all students to the same academic standard can prevent this problem from the very start and remove any more potential loopholes, allowing the true victims — those whose spots were taken — to have a chance at admission.

Newly elected USC president Carol Folt is no stranger to scandal.
From racial controversy to Title IX discrimination, Folt tackled a litany of investigations and challenges in her nearly six years as the chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But one of the new president’s most compelling experiences took place at the start of her tenure — a decades-long scheme that used academic fraud to benefit student athletes.
Folt became the new chancellor only months after the discovery of the scheme, which involved thousands of students and dated back over a decade. Over her first four years, she led UNC through an NCAA investigation and a complete overhaul of the way its athletics department approached academic standards.
This is much-needed experience for USC, which is just starting to face the repercussions of the college admissions bribery case recently uncovered by the FBI. The athletics program is at a crossroads, after firing water polo head coach Jovan Vavic and senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel for accepting bribes to falsify admits as athletic recruits. Between the school’s upcoming internal investigation and an impending one from the NCAA, Folt will be in familiar territory when she takes on the challenge of USC Athletics.
Beginning in 1992, North Carolina offered “paper” classes in the university’s African and Afro-American Studies departments. Essentially, these classes based grades on essays alone, and rarely actually met. The classes were frequented by student-athletes, who rarely wrote their own papers and thus boosted their GPAs without ever stepping foot inside the classroom.
Governor Jim Martin discovered these classes through an independent investigation in 2012. His findings reported that 216 of these “paper” classes were created over the course of two decades. However, Martin argued that the discretion fell on the academic department, not athletics, despite the fact that many of these courses were created at the insistence of academic advisors for the football team. Still, when a 2014 UNC investigation identified that over 3,000 students had taken these classes — over half of which consisted of student athletes — the NCAA started a formal investigation into the matter. 
Folt took on the chancellor position in the middle of this controversy in 2013. Besides firing four employees and disciplining five more, she formulated a broad set of reforms to attempt to prevent academic fraud as a whole on the UNC campus.
“When I was at UNC, the thing that impressed me the most was that the faculty came together and made 70 reforms,” Folt said to the Daily Trojan. “That was what was so wonderful. It wasn’t about eliminating athletics, it was about doing it right so that people could get what they needed and deserved.”
Although Folt’s tenure saw a vast expansion of transparency and enforcement of integrity policies between the athletics and academic departments, she also helped the school avoid further sanctions. At the conclusion of its investigation in 2017, the NCAA announced that it “could not conclude that the University of North Carolina violated NCAA academic rules.” 
This decision was based on the argument made by UNC lawyers that while the school was guilty of academic fraud, this was an internal academic issue, not something that fell under the realm of NCAA jurisdiction. Over the course of the investigation, the school spent close to $18 million in legal and public relations costs to generate this positive result. Although the NCAA decision sparked considerable controversy, Folt’s ability to navigate NCAA scandals was one of the many reasons that she was unanimously selected.
Regardless of her impact on the structure and integrity of the athletics department, Folt’s history at North Carolina hints that she could serve as a good luck charm for USC Athletics. In her five and a half years at Chapel Hill, the Tar Heels brought home 16 conference titles and four national championships across all of its sports, including the 2017 men’s basketball title. 
After attending a Duke vs. North Carolina basketball game during her initial visit of the school, Folt became a fast fan of the school’s teams and often appeared courtside to cheer on the Tar Heels. During her time, she made the student athlete experience a main focus in her approach to athletics as a whole.
“Her support has been unyielding, and we appreciate all she has done for our student-athletes,” North Carolina Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham said in an interview with UNC’s University Gazette earlier this year. “Her dedication to our student-athlete experience and their success has been second to none.”
In her first day on the job at USC, Folt made it clear that the student athlete experience will be remain one of her main focuses as she wades into her role as president.
“I really believe college athletes can be a enriching and rewarding experience,” Folt said. “Student athletes [are] where I start. Who are they? Are we giving them what we need? Are they graduating with the skills they need… If we’re gonna do it, we’re gonna do it right.”

Over 150 students, faculty and staff attended an interfaith vigil held in commemoration of the terrorist attack on March 14 in Christchurch, New Zealand, which claimed the lives of 49 worshippers celebrating Jumu’ah, a weekly Muslim congregational prayer. The vigil emphasized the need for community, stressing the importance of coming together during times of tragedy.
“We are here to know each other, to grow with each other, to love each other, to understand that our differences and our diversity are things that bring us together in a way that makes us a family — a Trojan family, a global family — representing every country in the world, every religion on the planet,” Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said.
The event was hosted by the Muslim Student Union, Interfaith Council, the Office of Religious Life and Ansar Service Partnership, a Muslim community service organization on campus.
In a memorandum sent to the USC community on March 15, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs Michael W. Quick wrote that the purpose of the vigil was to support and uplift Muslim communities — both globally and on campus. 
“Over the last several years, there has been a dramatic rise in Islamophobic hate crimes across the United States and around the world,” Quick wrote. “We want our Muslim community … to know that we work closely with public safety and law enforcement to ensure that everyone in our community is safe.”
Soni opened the vigil with a statement about the prevalence of hate crimes directed at religious communities and how the USC community has previously come together to memorialize them.
“When we come together, we say we cannot normalize [mass shootings],” Soni said. “This can’t be normal. This is not the world we want to live in. We stand for something bigger than this.” 
Director of Muslim Life Jibreel Speight offered a prayer and words of wisdom regarding how students can stand in solidarity with different communities. 
“[I want us] to be leaders of positivity, to be builders of communities, to be support systems when we are in need, to be light when there seems to be darkness,” Speight said.
Associate Dean of Religious Life Vanessa Gomez Brake introduced Muslim Student Union members as they read aloud the names of the victims.
“Our deepest sympathies go out to the victims, their families, friends and their nation,” Brake said. “So let us remember — together — the communities of Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre.”
After a moment of silence was observed, MSU president Zayn Razi told the story of Daoud Nabi, a prominent member of the Islamic community in New Zealand who died shielding a man from the shooter.
“I tell you this story about this man because I want you to know what a real Muslim looks like,” Razi said. “I want you to know what Islam is: Islam is Daoud Nabi.” 
Razi also discussed the way the Muslim community has been misrepresented and how fear and ignorance fuels hate crimes.
“If they know us, they have no reason to be afraid, they have no reason to hate,” Razi said.
Paarsa Haque, student leader of ASP, read a quote from a rabbi she knew in her community in Memphis about the importance of community.
“‘The cancer of hate will only stop when we stand together in solidarity and love,’” Haque said. “Seeing you all here today reminds us that these situations affect us all and they bring communities together.”
The Rev. Richard Sunwoo, parish pastor of the Caruso Catholic Center, and Bailey London, executive director of Hillel, offered interfaith support and prayer to the Muslim community. 
“We pray, almighty God, that you restore peace and that you remind us of your love, especially now as our ears grow weary and tired of hearing about bloodshed and injustice,” Sunwoo said.
Four stations were set up at the vigil where attendees could write messages of support to Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre, the two mosques targeted in New Zealand’s deadliest mass shooting. 
In closing, Soni directly addressed the Muslim students in attendance and reminded them of their value and importance at the University, regardless of acts of Islamophobia that have occurred throughout the world.
“I know this is a difficult time for you,” Soni said. “Over the last several years, we have seen a dramatic rise in Islamophobic hate crimes in our country and around the world. I want you all to know that this is your home, that this is your family, that you belong here, that we love you and that you’re safe.”
Speakers at the vigil also encouraged students to engage with the Muslim community during Islam Awareness Week next week.
Awo Jama, a freshman majoring in journalism, said she felt healed by the vigil and hopes the attack in New Zealand spurs change.
“I really hope that after this tragedy people will really put forth more of an effort to humanize Muslims and to get to know us and what our faith is — to understand that our faith isn’t about hate or terrorism, but it’s about peace,” Jama said.

Amid a college admissions bribery scheme; a $215 million federal class action settlement; two ongoing sexual assault investigations; an athletics bribery lawsuit; and the appointment of a new president, the USC community has continually increased its calls for transparency. Students, faculty and staff have spoken out at open University forums, in letters to the Board of Trustees and through campus protests and petitions.


But transparency remained elusive when the names of the 17 members of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees — which calls the shots on some of USC’s most pressing issues — were kept confidential. And the Board’s meeting minutes are not made public.


But Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said he is tired of the secrecy surrounding the Board’s 11 classified committees.


“Every committee should be transparent,” Caruso said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “How can you serve people if they don’t know who you are?”  


According to the University bylaws, the Executive Committee holds all the same powers as the Board, save for a few, such as amending bylaws and appointing or changing the members of the Board’s various committees.


The Executive Committee has duties reserved for specific circumstances — like the resignation of former President C. L. Max Nikias and the investigation into former medical school dean Carmen Puliafito, who used methamphetamines on the same days he saw patients.


In the interview, Caruso disclosed the names of the 17 voting and five non-voting members of the Board’s Executive Committee, comprising celebrities, business executives and philanthropists.


“There’s these silly old rules that people had … trustees can’t meet with students, trustees can’t meet with faculty, trustees can’t meet with deans. It’s crazy,” Caruso said.

Billionaire businessman Rick Caruso was appointed to the Board of Trustees as chairman in May 2018. Caruso, 60, is the founder and CEO of a real estate company that owns and manages prominent shopping centers such as The Grove  in Los Angeles and The Americana at Brand in Glendale.


The alumnus, who formerly served as president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, is a major donor and the namesake of both the Keck School of Medicine otolaryngology department and the University’s Catholic center, following nearly $50 million in donations.


Wallis Annenberg


The longest-serving member on the Board of Trustees, Wallis Annenberg, 79, is the chairman, president and CEO of the Annenberg Foundation, a multibillion-dollar philanthropic organization. Annenberg most recently made a $10 million donation to the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2017.


The school is named after her father, Walter Annenberg, who founded the School of Communication in 1971, and Wallis Annenberg Hall built in 2014 was named after her.


Wallis Annenberg is also the fourth person to receive USC’s University Medallion, which is awarded “very selectively to those who have made major contributions to the university,” according to the website of the Provost.

Interim President Wanda Austin, 65, joined the Board of Trustees in 2010. The former president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, Austin earned her doctorate in systems engineering from USC in 1988.


Austin was appointed by the Board of Trustees in August 2018 and was the first woman to lead the University. As interim president, she has created multiple University task forces, including the Task Force on University Nomenclature, and set up oversight offices like the Office of the Ombuds.


On the Executive Committee, Austin has served ‘ex officio’ since she took on the role as interim president. ‘Ex officio’ means an individual is granted membership to the Board, by virtue of their position.


Austin will formally step down from her position as interim president on June 30, but will remain a trustee, according to Caruso.


David Dornsife


Marshall School of Business alumnus David Dornsife was elected to the Board of Trustees in 2002, according to USC News. Dornsife, 75, is the chairman of the Herrick Corporation, one of the largest steel fabricators in the United States, according to the company’s website.

On Jan. 22, Gold responded to a letter addressed to the Board and Caruso penned by the Concerned Faculty of USC, which called for shared governance and increased transparency following the firing of Marshall School of Business Dean Jim Ellis. Gold publicly lambasted the letter’s authors and partially blamed the University’s faults on the abrupt termination of former President C. L. Max Nikias.


“It is my hope that the faculties of other schools will be more discerning than the Law School faculty before joining your band of know-nothing vigilantes,” Gold wrote.

John Mork


John Mork, CEO of Energy Corporation of America, previously served as the chairman of the Board before Caruso assumed the position last May. Mork, 71, pledged $110 million to fund scholarships at USC.


“For over a decade, USC has benefited enormously from John Mork’s boundless energy and passion for our academic mission and from his family’s extraordinary generosity in ensuring that the life-changing gift of a USC education will be available to generations of young men and women far into the future,” Nikias told USC News.

Departing football players took Cromwell Field Wednesday morning for USC’s Pro Day to demonstrate their talent to NFL scouts. The event had a unique participant, blind long snapper Jake Olson, who put on quite a show with 17 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press to raise money for cancer research.
Some Trojans who attended the NFL Scouting Combine a few weeks ago had the chance to demonstrate their abilities to scouts from more teams. For defensive backs Marvell Tell and Iman Marshall, linebackers Porter Gustin and Cam Smith and offensive lineman Chuma Edoga, Pro Day was an opportunity to play on home turf without the immense mental strain of the combine and to receive more personalized evaluations from team officials. 
Coming off an ankle injury that derailed his senior season, Gustin struggled at the combine in the field workouts, although he impressed in the 40-yard dash and measurables. Equal parts WWE wrestler and hulking Rambo, Gustin is a far cry from the modern day edge-rushing linebackers who run blazing sub-4.5 40 times. No one expects Gustin to be buttery smooth on the field; however, he certainly showed passable fluidity to pair with his immense power in the field drills. 
Gustin said that scouts are concerned with his injury history, but he seemed confident that he is not “injury prone” and is instead the unfortunate recipient of “freak injuries” that have all been solely bone-related. Gustin, while lacking that agile bend that pass rushers need to turn the edge and rack up sacks, is projected to be a stout edge run defender who can muscle his way to a few sacks in the NFL.
Smith also had a solid day. He considers himself someone who can quarterback a defense and is generally seen as a more cerebral player. While Smith was not “happy” with his performance, he said he was “content,” as he felt he proved his athleticism enough to allow his fundamentals and football IQ to shine through. 
A tackling machine for the Trojans for four years, Smith used Pro Day to showcase his knowledge of the game off the field in interviews with team officials. Smith is considered a mid-round talent but could be a solid contributor despite his pedestrian athleticism due to his leadership on the field and in the locker room.
In addition to a great day on the field that demonstrated his versatility, Marshall gave teams a chance to get to know his personality. As a tough press man corner at 6-foot-1, Marshall often acts as a bully, matching up with bigger receivers and maintaining a high level of physicality. Marshall was nimble for his size in the drills and already proved his speed at the combine. Teams have been evaluating him as a safety, and he said he felt his athleticism and knowledge showed scouts that he could play the position at the next level. 
Marshall maintained that swagger during interviews, stating his goal was to be the best, and he wasn’t going to stop working until he got there. Marshall said he was excited for the opportunity to play with the best. 
“You play this game to be a competitor,” he said. “If you’re not a competitor, why are you playing?” 
Tell showed his strengths well in the field drills, demonstrating a particular burst in the ‘W’ drill. Teams are considering switching the 6-foot-2 Tell to cornerback, where his athleticism can be fully displayed. Throughout the season, Tell was a leader of USC’s defense and developed press coverage skills visible at Pro Day that will transition well to the league. 
Best known for the quickness he showed at the combine, Edoga did not look quite as strong at Pro Day. His heavier physique may have teams questioning his strength in pass protection, though he looks to be a solid run blocker in the league.
Pro Day is also an opportunity for lesser known prospects to gain traction and meet with team officials. Running back Aca’Cedric Ware looked explosive coming out of near 90-degree cuts and ran good routes. He did not drop a single pass and looked more fluid than expected coming out of his breaks in the pass game.

Both the men’s and women’s tennis teams enter the stretch run looking to build momentum into their respective conference tournaments in late April. While the two teams have experienced different results thus far, both have the talent to make a splash in postseason play, and the process of fulfilling those expectations continues for both teams this weekend.
After finishing in second place at the BNP Paribas Open Collegiate Tennis Challenge present by Oracle, the USC men’s tennis team is looking forward to its upcoming road matchup Saturday against No. 3 Texas.
“They’re a great team they just beat the number one team in the country so it’ll be a cool opportunity to play a higher ranked team and hopefully pick up a win,” said junior Riley Smith.
The Longhorns will prove to be a tough matchup for the Trojans as they are fresh off of an upset win over Ohio State in which they dominated the Buckeyes 4-1, a victory that puts Texas at an astounding 16-1 overall record. The Trojans, however, are optimistic about their chances.
“We look at all the matches on paper and it looks like all the matches can go either way, but we’re in a really good spot and I’m looking forward to it,” Smith said of this weekend’s matchup.
The now-No. 15 Trojans have not lived up to their preseason expectations when they started the year No. 5 in the nation. Part of this has to do with a difficult stretch which saw the Trojans lose five out of six matches. Before falling to No. 6 Baylor this past weekend, however, the Trojans had won four in a row.
“It’s going good, we’re just constantly improving,” Smith said. “This isn’t the start that we necessarily wanted with that many losses but we’re getting better and playing better as a team.” 
Smith added that one of the team’s strengths is holding each other accountable for individual performance and that this atmosphere pushes each player to improve.
“I’ve been playing better lately, getting in better shape, I mean my teammates are really pushing me. I’ve been working hard with the coaches and I’m happy at where I am at now,” Smith said about his individual performance.
This weekend will provide a difficult test for the Trojans and will provide a marker to see if the recent hot streak was a sign of things to come as the season wraps up. USC has to prove that the win streak wasn’t just a flash in the pan. It can’t continue to lose close matches against better ranked opposition. With eight matches left, the Trojans will need to get hot once again and close out the season strong to try and meet their preseason expectations of being national championship contenders.
As for the women’s tennis team, the Trojans come back from the BNP Paribas Open Collegiate Tennis Challenge present by Oracle with a 4-2 win over Baylor. Now sitting at 11-2, USC will travel to Eugene to take on Oregon Saturday. 
The Trojans are riding a seven-game win streak which includes a statement win over No. 3 UCLA just a few weeks ago. Now ranked No. 11 in the country and with a 2-0 in Pac-12 play, USC will look to continue its hot streak as it takes on an Oregon team that has lost six matches in a row. 
With home matches against Cal and Stanford looming next weekend, this weekend’s match has the potential to be a trap for the young Trojans. They will need to remain focused and disciplined before looking ahead to the upcoming rivalry matchups.
The resurgent women’s tennis program is led by freshman Danielle Willson, who is undefeated in dual match play at 11-0. Willson’s hard work was recognized a few weeks ago when she was awarded an athletic scholarship. 
With 10 matches left to play this season, there is still a lot that can happen. For now, this season has been impressive for the women’s tennis team and, with some strong play, the Trojans could see themselves qualify for the NCAA tournament.

WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MEMORY AT USC?
My favorite memory so far was my junior year. We had a game against UCLA — it was senior night last year. There was a lot of people, a lot of pressure and we came up with a win that night. I’m going to remember that game forever.
Beating UCLA at home was just magical, especially doing it on senior night for some of those guys [who are] some of my best friends today.
DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS FROM THE PAST FOUR YEARS?
No regrets at all. When you don’t win a championship, you’re always like, “I wish I would’ve done that.” We’re working hard this year to reach that goal.
WHAT’S ONE THING ABOUT VOLLEYBALL THAT MOST PEOPLE DON’T KNOW?
In the U.S., it’s not really a popular sport. One of our coaches, Greg Walker, talks about entertaining people: ‘What are you going to do for people to come watch you?’ It has to be exciting. Sometimes, I feel like some people lack excitement [for the sport]. It’s something that we always work on, to put on a show for everyone to come to watch.
WAS IT DIFFICULT TO ADJUST TO LIFE IN AMERICA?
It was tough in the beginning. Of course, there’s a language barrier, understanding what your coaches want, how you’re going to make new friends. The culture’s totally different. The environment is different. It was always a challenge to adapt. It took me a while to understand more about the people. 
Volleyball is played all around the world, but the way they play it in the U.S. is totally different from the way they play it in Brazil. [In Brazil], it’s a way more emotional game. You play with your heart. You play for the fans. In the U.S., it’s more of a statistical game. In my opinion, that’s why people don’t really watch it here — the excitement that some of the players don’t have.
I made a lot of friends playing volleyball. It definitely helped that all my teammates knew English, helped me develop my language as well on the court. 
WHAT ABOUT TRANSFERRING FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE? WAS THAT A CHALLENGE?
Coming from Orange Coast College in Orange County, of course the level of volleyball was way higher playing Division I here at USC. It’s tough to adjust to the speed of the game. After a lot of hard work and dedication, you adapt to it easily. 
WHAT’S NEXT FOR YOU?
I’m not really sure about that yet. I have a couple options — I could pursue volleyball overseas. But I’m also ready to get a job, start a life, and move on.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR FRESHMEN ATHLETES?
Just keep your head high. Sometimes it’s going to be a roller coaster ride. There’s going to be ups and downs. You’ve just got to keep your head up, just keep working hard. If you work hard, it’s going to pay off in the end.

One of the best lessons I’ve learned over eight years of student journalism is that news comes in waves.
Nothing ever happens neatly, one by one, allowing proper time to rest and recuperate before the next news item comes along. When news happens, it’s typically a downpour, and in the deluge it’s often easy to miss out on much of what is happening.
The past week has certainly been that way for the USC community, from admissions scandals and tragedy to the announcement of our new president. And no sector of news suffers from these crashing waves of news more than sports, where trade deadlines and playoff schedules construct timelines that move from wildly hectic to shockingly dull on a regular basis.
March has been the former state, a wonderful combination of the start of March Madness and a collection of shocking NBA, MLB and NFL trades and contract negotiations. Even storylines such as the U.S. women’s soccer team’s lawsuit, which typically would garner top attention, have struggled to maintain a presence in the nightly headlines. This is a common battle in any sort of oversaturated news environment, where no single story can reign supreme unless it holds an otherworldly, overarching importance — LeBron James leaving Cleveland, for example.
But this week, unfortunately, the rush of recent news overshadowed an event that often gets pushed to the back burner of sports media. Last Thursday, the opening ceremonies of the Special Olympics took place in Abu Dhabi, bringing together thousands of athletes from almost 200 countries. 
The event was met with a scattering of press awareness here in the U.S., as outlets such as ESPN interspersed its typical coverage with content and clips of events. Most of this coverage took place on social media, but it was few and far between, easy to miss amid headlines about Mike Trout and Le’Veon Bell’s contracts. In fact, most sports fans in America are likely unaware that halfway around the world, hundreds of U.S. athletes are competing in the biggest event of their lives. 
Today, on the day of the Games’ closing ceremonies, I think it’s important to spend at least a moment appreciating the athletes who represented the U.S. over the past week. At the end of the Special Olympics, the U.S. has won almost 200 medals — 69 gold, 55 silver and 67 bronze. 
Of course, the importance of this event runs much deeper than just medals and on-the-field accolades. For these athletes, the Special Olympics offers the same intangibles that any other Olympic athlete would receive. It’s a chance to experience other cultures, deepen team relationships and create new ones around the world. It’s an opportunity to showcase years of hard work and to receive international recognition for their dedication.
I served as a Special Olympics coach in high school, and I’ve seen firsthand the impact that this organization can have on athletes of all ages. Over the past week, that impact has been beautifully illustrated — from the power lifter who impressed Arnold Schwarzenegger to the athlete who hit a 75-foot full-court shot to beat the buzzer. The Special Olympics is a place that creates joy, and the entirety of the past week’s events have been filled with it.
Maybe you weren’t aware of the Special Olympics, or didn’t follow it closely during this year’s Games. That’s completely OK — as a sports fan, it’s hard to keep up with everything, and this year’s Special Olympics slipped under the radar. But I hope that they will continue to inspire people, those who love sports and those who just love others, to support and further this organization.
Often, we see how sports bring out the worst in one another. When spectators yell at athletes, when fans fight on Twitter, when stories of corruption and abuse and scandal dominate the sports news cycle, it’s sometimes difficult to believe that the good of sports could possibly outweigh the bad. But the Special Olympics has always been a counter to that, at least for me. It’s a reminder of the joy and love that sports can create and the way in which sports can connect people across any difference of culture or ability.
We might not get everything right when it comes to sports. But the Special Olympics has it figured out — emphasizing the good of sports, and letting everything else follow.

Some cities, over the course of several decades, have cemented a singular food into their identities. The Philly cheesesteak is foundational to Philadelphia’s reputation as a city. Deep-dish pizza is baked into the brick buildings of Chicago. Boston is sealed together with clam chowder and custard from a cream pie. These foods extract the cadence of a city and personalize an intangible culture. They are also capable of inciting fire-filled debates, attracting an ungodly amount of tourists and comforting a traveler returning home. 
From an outsider’s perspective, even cities filled with thousands of diverse voices can have a unifying dish. New York City, as flavorful as it is, can be boiled down to a dollar slice pizza (or maybe a slice of cheesecake). 
But living in Los Angeles, my view of our iconic food is muddled. As the rumored birthplace of the cobb salad and the French dip, Los Angeles has had its fair share of historical foods, and, with its constant trudge toward novelty, Los Angeles has also birthed its fair share of modern trends. But the French dip doesn’t gleam from shiny postcards at L.A. tourist traps, nor does the cobb salad, a slice of pizza, a specialty dessert or cut of meat.
What is the quintessential food icon of Los Angeles?
In the world of regional variations, the L.A. hot dog is a standout. The sizzling bacon-wrapped street dogs that cut through any post-event drunken stupor can only be found in Southern California, and Los Angeles has the highest concentration. Even beyond the danger dog, Pink’s Hot Dogs attracts a long line of tourists, who are eager to try its famous loaded toppings. The Dodger Dog has cultivated a substantial fanbase of its own. Alas, these other hot dog purveyors are recycling the inventions of other cities — stealing from the sacred cult of the American hot dog. In the end, only the danger dog is enough to represent Los Angeles, and even that lacks the notoriety necessary to make it an icon. 
In the world of movie stars and health gurus, there are several popular foods that Los Angeles pioneered or propagated. Green juice, avocado toast, smoothie bowls: All are modern emblems of diet-conscious Angelenos. But it is hard to pinpoint Los Angeles as the true owner of any of these foods — often, this city takes a healthful dish from another trendy city (Seattle, Portland, Palo Alto) and infuses it with cultural relevance, which then results in online fame. And, honestly, no city should be represented by Goop’s clay and maca diet.
Maybe, the iconic food of Los Angeles was brought from overseas. Legend has it that, in the fancy dining rooms of 1980s L.A., sushi was transformed from a foreign oddity to a luxurious specialty with the creation of the American palette-friendly California roll, with later add-ins like cream cheese, tempura and even steak. Now, Los Angeles is home to some of the best sushi in the country. But even then, the best L.A. sushi can only replicate Japanese sushi. With a cooking style so dependent on method and mastery, sushi can never truly belong to Los Angeles — its heart will always remain in Japan.
In my mind, the best contender for L.A.’s most iconic food is the taco. While borrowed from Mexico, the amount of variation and revolution in Los Angeles tacos make them something that uniquely belong to this city. The tacos at B.S. Taqueria, Guerilla Tacos, Guisados and Mariscos Jalisco are meticulous masterpieces, blending regional influence with California’s emphasis on fresh flavor. And the street and truck taco is ubiquitous in L.A., rivaling the dirt dog in nighttime popularity. But with such a colorful assortment of tacos, it is impossible to determine which taco is the L.A. taco — Los Angeles is divided by taco pluralism, where no taco is ubiquitous and most are delicious. 
Perhaps, from an outsider’s perspective, there is no iconic Los Angeles food because this city is still buried under the preconception that Angelenos are too concerned with their health to value good food. Perhaps L.A. is just a city of poke bowls and celery juices, where vegan alternatives reign supreme. It wouldn’t be surprising if other cities saw Los Angeles in this way — the Michelin critics said the same when they stopped reviewing L.A. restaurants in 2010. 
This might have been true 10 years ago but certainly not now. Los Angeles was constructed on delicious beef sandwiches, overblown hot dogs and signature salads, but it was completed with some of the best Korean and Japanese food in the country, tacos worth waiting in line at 2 a.m. for and ingredient-forward restaurants that transform our expectations of Los Angeles as a city preoccupied with its image.
Maybe Los Angeles is better off without a signature dish. Without a chunk of restaurants churning out a monotonous menu, this city has diversified itself, offering a multitude of reputable dishes instead. If the taco is the winner of the icon debate, there are hundreds of distinctive tacos to try across the city. If the dirt dog is the winner, it says something else about Los Angeles — as a city known for its superficiality, an unassuming cart on the side of the road seems like the last place to look for legacy, yet we cherish those dogs with fervor. 
The debate rages on, but I take comfort in knowing that Los Angeles refuses to be boiled down to a singular dish because it feels as unexpected and diverse as the city itself.

When students are asked to share a fun fact about themselves on the first day of class, stories of broken bones, zany childhood mishaps and adventurous vacations typically popcorn the room. 
But Chandra Lee Ingram, a junior majoring in journalism and international relations and the global economy, had a particularly memorable first-day fun fact when she took a class with Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Lisa Pecot-Hébert. 
“‘Well, I’ve written a novel,’” Ingram told Pecot-Hébert’s class matter-of-factly, according to the professor herself. 
Remembering the event now, Pecot-Hébert recalls during a Journalism Director’s Forum talk with Ingram in Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday that she moderated.
“I was like, ‘What?’” 
Ingram did not just write a few chapters on a bored summer afternoon; she had fully published her novel “Freedom Child,” which explored the phenomenon of child slavery in India. She’d been working on the novel since seventh grade.
The story of the book’s creation begins back when Ingram’s family moved to Bangalore (now Bengaluru), in southwestern India, from San Francisco. More disappointed that she would miss Little League than scared about the prospect of moving across the world, Ingram quickly settled into her new life, where she attended an international school and lived in a gated community. 
When she left the confines of her sheltered life, Ingram witnessed the reality of her new environment. Outside her gated community, Ingram met a young girl named Krisha, who was about her age. Ingram was confused: Why wasn’t Krisha in school like her? 
It was then that Ingram’s mother, who also attended Tuesday’s talk, had to explain to her young daughter the complexities of the caste system, corruption and poverty in India. Krisha wasn’t in school because she was a child slave. 
Recalling the horrors she saw once she decided to learn more about slavery in her new country, Ingram began to cry in the middle of her discussion with Pecot-Hébert. She recalled learning about children who were abducted at a critical age. 
“I started writing when I was the same age as them,” she explained. 
When she returned to the U.S., Ingram was startled by how few people knew about modern day slavery, a phenomenon occurring not just in India but all around the world. 
Ingram then began what would eventually become “Freedom Child,” typing away in her middle school bedroom. 
Despite her prodigious start, Ingram said it took her some time to see the power of her voice as an individual. She says her age often proved a barrier, as well as her initial inability to narrow down the stories of all of the people she met in India into a single story. 
She said she intentionally chose to focus on a single narrative. 
“I wanted to inspire and create change by writing a coherent narrative,” Ingram said. “We as humans tend to shut out what makes us uncomfortable.” 
Eventually, she decided to write about two fictional young girls, Mukti and Ruchita, former friends who were both enslaved. She’s now working on a sequel, which will focus on boys in the bondage system.
“I put myself in their shoes because I could have been in their shoes,” Ingram said. “Any of us could have.” 
Sometimes, Ingram admitted, she felt as if it wasn’t her story to tell. In these moments, she had to recognize her immense power and privilege. 
“My privilege is my voice,” Ingram said. “[I saw that] girls and boys my age didn’t have that voice. I can’t save every boy and girl. I can give them a voice.”

After raising nearly $30,000 and compiling a team of 70 people and multiple student organizations, the immersive theatrical experience of “Ascend: When Myths Fall, Heroes Rise” will come to life this Saturday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom. Throughout the experience, attendees will participate in quests, games and interactive experiences related to a storyline that brings together demigods from Greek, Chinese, Egyptian and Mayan mythology at a family reunion that quickly goes south. 
“I like to think of it as a mix between interactive dinner theater, an escape room and a theme park,” said Alexander Walter, the head set designer of the production. 
Walter, a junior majoring in theatre, also serves as a member of the narrative team for the event. 
Junior Anahita Dalmia, the executive producer and initial founder of the project, said she also developed a similar production last year — an interactive “Harry Potter”-themed experience called “Alohamora: Unlock the Wizarding World.”
“[We’re] getting the opportunity to work with so many people from different disciplines who are bringing together their ideas and expertise to create this one coherent experience,” Dalmia said. 
In addition to the production team, “Ascend” was created with help from USG’s Special Projects Committee, student group Escape SC and partnerships with other campus organizations like Late Night ’SC, the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and the International Student Assembly. 
The result of these collaborations is an experience that represents a multitude of talents and components. Escape SC provides 14 games in the experience, including a 30-minute escape room, an archery game and a large-scale battleship. There are 30 actors for audience members to interact with, and the physical space is divided into three “realms,” which feature a multitude of special effects spectacles. 
“We want to create a world that people can participate in,” Dalmia said. “Because being a part of the story, not just through others’ eyes but through your own is so important.” 
Besides worldbuilding, another large inspiration for the event was a desire for participants to have agency in their individual experiences, Dalmia said. Attendees cannot experience every aspect of the production because of time limits and the activities they choose. The entire experience is based on audience choice, including the ending. 
“It is completely up to you how you want to choose to interact with the story, and the world goes on without you … It is literally putting every player or every participant or audience member in the position of [the] hero [in] their own story,” Dalmia said. 
The audience’s agency in the production is also intended to have a concrete takeaway. 
“We want people to do is reflect on the choices [they make], so they can make better ones,” Dalmia said. 
Senior Jack McCarthy, Ascend’s theatrical director, says that audience participation is integral to the experience of theatre. 
“The purpose of theatre is to give us a spiritual experience where we can understand or experience something we wouldn’t get to otherwise,” McCarthy said. “When you’re physically participating, that experience is increased tenfold, the fun in that is maximized, but I think the spiritual understanding is also maximized.”
Ideally, the story is a replayable experience that allows participants to pursue alternate plotlines and pathways. Dalmia explained that part of the fun is completing different quests and piecing information together with friends after the fact. 
The event as it exists now will only run on March 24. The team worked long and hard to create an experience that will only occur once, Dalmia said. 
“The team inspires me every single day,” Dalmia said. “Every one of them has unquestionably put in more time and work than I could ever ask for and this is greater than something I ever could have imagined.” 
Reservations are available through Ascend’s Facebook page.

As I walked past the red brick buildings, eager to start my first day as a Trojan in 2017, I was captivated by the myriad flags representing the student population at USC. Could it be that, after being one of the few members of the Latinx community in my AP classes, I would finally take classes with people who shared my narrative? 
The answer, I quickly learned, was no. I continued to see a lack of minority representation everywhere. I feared that because of my background and the color of my skin, imposter syndrome would continue to plague my life. Feeling unworthy of a quality education is a common sentiment among many students of color. I find it quite ironic and amusing that the actual imposters were those who cheated the system to get their children into USC. Those spots should’ve belonged to an athlete who spent countless hours on the field, a single mother who went to a community college in hopes of transferring to USC or a straight-A undocumented student who lived in constant fear of being deported yet had the courage to pursue liberation through education. What’s even more fascinating, however, is that those imposters often never suffer from imposter syndrome themselves. 
As a first-generation transfer student, I could not relate to the narratives of my colleagues who came from wealthy households. Naturally, I questioned why, out of over 56,000 applicants, I was one of fortunate enough to be accepted to this prestigious institution. I realized that it was not luck that opened the door to USC, but rather countless hours spent in the library and late nights spent on homework after a long day of work and classes. 
The news that wealthy, white individuals were bribing their way into our institution is not news at all. Why does it take a huge scandal for us to address issues that are right under our noses? We need to raise our voices to talk about these injustices regardless of who it makes uncomfortable. 
This scandal raises issues beyond the unfairness of the college admissions process. We need to address the racial and socioeconomic disparities not only at USC or other elite universities, but also in our education system in its entirety. We need to question if the system in place currently is actually a meritocracy. We need to question the unfairness of our country’s justice system. We need to question the problems with standardized testing. 
Why is it that Kelley Williams Bolar, an underprivileged black woman, was subject to our racist justice system and sentenced to jail for using a relative’s address, so her daughter could attend school in a better school district? Meanwhile, Lori Laughlin paid a fine that will hardly bruise her bank account and is allowed to stay in the comfort of her home. Based on the inequities regarding access to education, it is loud and clear that rich white people face little to no legal consequences compared to those of color, specifically black people. We must continue having these conversations — and if it makes people uncomfortable, so be it. We are doing something right.
The USC administration must acknowledge and take full responsibility for their negligence and pledge loyalty to us, the students. USC needs to provide more oversight over our athletics department and improve transparency and communication. Sending out memos is not enough. Students demand action; we demand this institution be held accountable. 
That being said, I’d like to welcome our new president-elect Carol Folt to the Trojan Family and call on her to be an ally to the student body. And to current students who earned their place at USC, you’re doing fantastic. Keep setting the example for future generations and continue to speak out. That is what true leadership is. And in the words of Aubrey Graham, “know yourself, know your worth.” Fight on.

Covering breaking news can be fun. There’s that adrenaline rush you get from wanting to report and write your story as quickly as possible, an unmatched sense of accomplishment after finishing an important story and an understanding of the impact of your work as you see hundreds of people liking and sharing your work across the internet. 
Last year, I was a news editor for the Daily Trojan, and I jumped at the chance to cover breaking news stories — from a controversial fraternity party at the beginning of the spring semester to former president C. L. Max Nikias’ resignation. 
But it reached a point where I was sacrificing other aspects of my life — mainly my mental health — to cover breaking news. The adrenaline is fun in the moment, but it becomes exhausting afterward, when you’re burnt out but still have to keep up with any developments to the story. You start to dread seeing notifications on your phone, afraid that it’s more breaking news. You begin to fear the sounds of fire trucks and police car sirens because you don’t want to have to report on another accident. 
USC doesn’t make covering such news easy for its student journalists. When school is in session, the Daily Trojan’s news editors often have to cover a new scandal every week, and there are constantly new developments in the seemingly endless lawsuits and investigations the University is facing. 
The few breaks we get during the year should be a chance for students to rest, but USC seems to whip out a major breaking news story during every vacation — the nationwide college admissions bribery scheme was announced over spring break, Marshall Dean James Ellis was terminated just as winter break started and allegations against former gynecologist George Tyndall were revealed at the beginning of summer break last year. 
That means a constant barrage of news our small team of news and managing editors (comprising five people if we’re lucky) scrambles to cover day in and day out. It’s exhausting. 
Last year, I realized breaking news was causing me severe anxiety, so I stopped reporting on it almost entirely. After a while, my fear, exhaustion and dread I had dwindled down. But this is something of an epidemic in newsrooms — according to a 2018 European Journalism Centre News Impact Network study, 50 percent of journalists said they felt overwhelmed by their day-to-day jobs, while only 7 percent felt their work was manageable. Not all of those overwhelmed journalists can quit news like I did. 
On top of the anxiety-inducing nature of covering any breaking news, journalists are often covering highly traumatic stories. War correspondents are right on the frontlines with soldiers while reporting news, leading to over 30 percent of them experiencing post-traumatic stress, a 2002 University of Toronto study found. 
But experiencing trauma as a journalist isn’t limited to war reporting, even if it’s secondhand. Reporters themselves might not realize it, but covering traumatic stories, even from behind the desk in a newsroom, can greatly impact their mental health. 
Sonali Kohli, an education reporter for the Los Angeles Times, posted a Twitter thread on March 7 about her post-traumatic stress symptoms after reporting on deadly fires, mass shootings and a project on homicides near schools. 
“Hearing ambulances or seeing police helicopters hovering made my heart race,” Kohli tweeted. “Candles and bonfires terrified me. Every space I entered, I imagined how it could be the next target of a fire or shooting … secondary trauma is a real thing and it can happen whether you are reporting from the field or a computer.”
Newsrooms need to start having real conversations about self-care for journalists and ensure they aren’t overworking their employees. Journalists should be able to take time off to recover from reporting on traumatic events and should have easy access to counseling services when needed.
In many newsrooms, success as a journalist is often defined by having the most clips and reporting well on the hardest topics. These are obviously great accomplishments, but such expectations create a culture in which young journalists feel like they can’t succeed if they take a break from reporting on breaking news or aren’t throwing themselves at stories involving tragedies and disasters. Instead, newsrooms should encourage balance and reward quality over quantity. 
Even making small changes to the physical newsroom workspace can be greatly helpful — a 2015 HuffPost article detailed how The New York Times, Business Insider and similar news outlets designed their workspaces to look after their reporters’ well-being. Changes ranged from simply allowing natural light into the newsroom to creating meditation and nap rooms for employees. While these changes might seem small, HuffPost said the newsrooms saw improved change among their journalists after implementing them. 
Without significant changes to the way news reporters are cared for in their workplaces, news organizations will not only see significant detrimental effects to their journalists’ mental health but also continue to experience high turnover rates with journalists who are leaving the industry when it becomes too overwhelming. Reporting isn’t easy, and media organizations should ease that burden from their journalists’ shoulders.
