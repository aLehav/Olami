On Wednesday evening, the Center for Women and Men hosted Laughing Through the Tears: An Evening with Jessie Kahnweiler, the first of a series of three events honoring April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month on campus.
Wednesday’s event featured Jessie Kahnweiler, an L.A.-based actor and filmmaker who performs a one-woman comedy show addressing her experience as a rape survivor and how it affected both her sexuality and her identity.
Kahnweiler started by briefly introducing herself and her film, Meet My Rapist, a comedy about a hypothetical situation in which Kahnweiler runs into her rapist in a market.   In the film, she features her rapist as the most important man in her life, as she takes him to dates, job interviews, and even her parents’ house.
Her humorous tone with which she talks about her experience as a rape victim is her way of telling her story in the most honest way that she can. “There’s just these crazy situations and I almost just feel like to get through it, you have to laugh. And I really put it out there — not trying to make a light of it or make it a joke -— but really just be honest about my experience,” she said.
Kahnweiler then discussed how making the film contributed to her healing as a survivor, but it negatively affected her future romantic relationships.
“I created this rape monster,” she said, “I felt like I was in a prison, but I had created that prison.”
One day she realized that her rape and the film that came from it had had helped shape who she had become.
“I’m so freaking grateful to have been a survivor and having an eating disorder because it lead me on a path to really loving myself and understanding myself and connecting with better people and their vulnerability,” she said.
Kahnweiler then presented her new upcoming film, The Skinny, a dark comedy film that explores bulimia and eating disorders.   She discussed the inner conflict she felt being a feminist and having an eating disorder.
“Because I wear my feminism on my sleeve, I’m so happy to be a feminist and I love being a woman my idea of it was: if I’m going to be a feminist then I need to be strong and I cant be vulnerable and cant have an eating disorder, I know better than that,” she said.
After going to therapy, however, she found that she had a lot to work through, including facing her own eating disorder and experience with rape.
“For the first time in my life, it didn’t feel crazy to be vulnerable, it felt crazy not to be.  I had this new sense of purpose, coming out and wanting to share my story,” she said.
It was then that she decided to take on bulimia and body dysmorphia for her next video project.  Making this film wasn’t easy, however, and because people were not buying her script, she decided to do it herself.  She raised the money through Kickstarter and shot the pilot episode in her kitchen.  When someone told her that they had thought it was funny, yet incredibly sad, Kahnweiler said she felt validated.
“I would rather be honest than be skinny,” she said, “Either I’m honest and real and vulnerable and have a creative life, or I’m skinny.”
Kahnweiler also talked about how creating her own experiences have helped her in shaping her identity.
“As a survivor you feel like you are a symptom of your experience. I feel like having awareness and taking action and thinking about being vulnerable about those experiences is really just strength. The more awareness you have, the better,” she said.
Laughing through the Tears: An Evening with Jessie Kahnweiler is the first event of a three part series sponsored by the Center for Women and Men to raise awareness for sexual assault.
“A big part of us having this awareness month is to start talking about these issues, thinking about them and thinking about how they can get involved to be the change for our culture,” Dr. Ekta Kumar, the director for the Center for Women and Men, said.
The next event will be on April 28, featuring playwright Heather Marlowe who will be performing The Haze, a solo about how rape cases are handled in the San Francisco area.  The final event is Denim Day, which is an international day that encourages people to wear denim to support survivors of sexual assault and increase awareness.

TAMID at USC hosted Genius — previously called Rap-Genius — co-founder Mahbod Moghadam to speak about his company and how to effectively create start-ups on Wednesday evening at the Salvatori Computer Science Center.
TAMID at USC is a business organization that focuses on Israeli business and is established on campuses throughout the United States.
As part of its education component, TAMID invited Moghadam to speak about his success as an entrepreneur with Genius, a website that allows users to break down nearly any kind of text, from song lyrics to news stories, with line-by-line annotations. Currently the number one lyrics website in the world, Genius has raised over $56 million from many investors, which include Y Combinator, Andreesen Horowitz, Dan Gilbert, Alexis Ohanian, Nasir Jones and Betaworks.
Moghadam attended Yale University as an undergraduate and Stanford for law school before founding Rap-Genius with his friends Tom Lehman and Ilan Zechory. He resigned from Genius in May 2014 after making his own controversial annotations on the manifesto of Elliot Rodgers, who shot and killed six and injured fourteen near University of California, Santa Barbara in May 2014.
“I’m blocked from my own site,” Moghadam said. “It’s heartbreaking. I am the Moses of Genius, and I’m not allowed into the Holy Land.”
Though Moghadam is Persian and not of Israeli descent, he is a big supporter of Israeli businesses. Jordan Banafsheha, the president of TAMID, found Moghadam on Meerkat, a live stream application founded by three Israeli entrepreneurs.
After seeing Moghadam’s stream on Meerkat, Banafsheha, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business, asked Moghadam if he would like to speak at USC. Moghadam agreed by responding with his email over Twitter. Since then, Banafsheha and Moghadam have been planning the event for the last month.
“Mahbod supports Israeli businesses and that’s what we’re focused on,” said Danielle Fallon, vice president of operations for TAMID. “We like having high-profile figures come and educate our members, as well as the rest of USC entrepreneurship community, about their adventures and start-up stories.”
In her position, Fallon mainly handles marketing and logistics for TAMID. For this event in particular, part of her role was getting the word out to the USC community and reserving the room and sound system.
To attract a wide range of students to the event, Fallon and other board members sought out a variety of groups to participate in the event.
Following Banafsheha opening remarks, a two-student rap group called Rush Hour rapped two songs before Moghadam came on to speak.
Moghadam discussed the evolution of Genius and stressed the role Y Combinator had in its success. He encouraged start-ups with legitimate ideas to apply to YC. He also talked about his views on the technology industry in San Francisco and New York and the lack thereof in Los Angeles.
“There’s a big feud between Hollywood and tech,” Moghadam said.
After Moghadam spoke about his experiences, four groups pitched their start-ups to him and received feedback. The event ended with a Q&A session with Moghadam.
TAMID serves to educate students about the Israeli economy while also consulting for funded Israeli start-ups. The student business organization also invests in a small portfolio made up of securities listed in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In addition, TAMID selects a few students for its fellowship, allowing them to intern at firms in Israel during the summer. This year, six students will be interning in Israel with TAMID. Despite TAMID’s ties to Israeli businesses, it bears no political or religious affiliations.
TAMID currently has 90 active members, including one investment team and six consulting teams working with start-ups in Israel.
“Despite TAMID’s ties to Israeli businesses, it bears no political or religious affiliations.”
I take issue with this statement, because leading with the word “despite” implies that the default characterization for any entity affiliated with Israel, including her economy, is contentiously political or religious in nature.
When other student organizations invite speakers from startups in the US, does the DT include a disclaimer statement that these startups and the organizations that invited them have no religious or political affiliations? Or is this disclaimer reserved exclusively for student organizations affiliated with Israel?
Otherwise this article is well-written and great press for TAMID. The event sounds like it was a huge success. Congrats!

Also, please improve your research efforts. The org is called “TAMID Group”,  not “TAMID Invests in Israel”

Jason Collins, the first openly gay athlete in one of the four major American team sports, spoke Wednesday night at Seeley G. Mudd about his experience coming out in the NBA. Afterwards, there was a student-athlete panel discussing LGBT athletes’ experiences in the NCAA.
The event was sponsored by Speakers Committee, Trojan Pride, the Academic Culture Assembly and the Special Events Committee.
Collins played in the NBA for 13 seasons with New Jersey Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, Washington Wizards and Brooklyn Nets. In the 2012-2013 season, Collins announced he was gay. Later in 2014, he retired.
In April of 2014, Collins was on the cover of TIME Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People in the World” issue.
Collin said he got tired of lying to people by saying he was straight.
“Up until 2009 I was even engaged and I called off the wedding a month before we were supposed to get married,” Collins said. “From 2009 until 2013 when I came out, I never dated other women and I just made up a girlfriend. I played for a lot of eastern conference teams and I always said I had this girlfriend who lived in L.A. and never came out [to] visit … I just got tired of telling that lie.”
After much discomfort, Collins said he wanted to let it be known that he was gay.  He explained that his uncle who has been openly gay for close to 30 years, still has to explain his sexuality to some people.
“It’s not like when you come out … that’s it.”
Collins wanted to come out fully uncensored and from his perspective.
“I saw that TMZ had a little article on EJ, Magic Johnson’s son, and I didn’t want that to be me,” Collins said. “I wanted to control my story.
During the discussion, Collins cited his experience with Sports Illustrated, saying that the publication allowed him to tell hsi story from a first-person perspective.
“Most of the time when you’re an athlete or just a regular person you get interviewed [and] it’s always the reporter’s job to shape the story … but this was going to be all my words. I was able to take the conversation, shape my words onto paper and then I was the final editor.”
According to Collins, his teammates and fellow professional athletes were extremely encouraging and caring.
“One of the phone calls that came in … was Deron Williams, point guard for the Brooklyn Nets, and [he] was extremely supportive,” Collins said.  “Also, Jerry Stackhouse, former basketball player that went to North Carolina and was my teammate in Atlanta, just hearing [Jerry’s] response was incredible, because I really respect his opinion. His words were … extremely supportive. The same things from Paul Pierce. The list goes on, [and] Doc Rivers, people who just were extremely supportive.”
Despite people understanding his decision, Collins knew there would be others who wouldn’t agree.
“Later in your career, your talent level isn’t going to increase. [For] a lot of talent or evaluators … it’s the eyeballing test, it’s the ‘does he look like he can play,’” Collins said. “So I worked my butt off. I was in incredible shape … and I knew that I didn’t want to let anyone say that about me, yet one GM got back to me and did say something negative along those lines.”
Collins said people are capable of understanding other individuals situation and feelings. He discussed how a former teammate first made homophobic comments toward him, but later gave Collins full support.
“I didn’t know what to expect from him, however he was one of the guys who went out of his way early on when I was back with the team … [to say]  ‘hey, I just want you to know how proud I am of you, and I’m glad that you’re back in the league … I’m glad that you’re here and how big this is going to be for people going forward.’”
Collins explained that this represented a promising shift in attitudes toward him in his sexuality.
“This [sic] shows you that people are capable of change, that they just need someone to step up and show them.”
Jason is a washed up ball player who has parlayed this ‘coming out’ as a means to advance his future prospects. The impact it could have had, was wasted by a decade long silence. Get on with your life – no one cares. BTW – the guy next to him is HOT!

After a strong performance during the regular season, the USC men’s tennis team heads into tournament play ready to make its mark and win its sixth national championship in seven years. Before that, however, the squad will travel to Ojai this weekend to compete for the Pac-12 championship.
The tournament begins Wednesday, but USC won’t play their first match until Friday. With only Stanford seeded ahead of them in the Pac-12, USC will enter the tournament as the No. 2 seed and advance automatically into the semifinals. No. 3-seeded UCLA and No. 4-seeded California automatically advance to the quarterfinals on Thursday. The teams battling it out during the first round on Wednesday will be No. 5-seeded Oregon against No. 8-seeded Arizona and No. 6-seeded Washington against No. 7-seeded Utah.
The Trojans have a favorable bracket, considering that they could face either the Utah Utes, the Washington Huskies or the UCLA Bruins in the semifinals, all teams that the Trojans beat in conference play earlier this season. The Trojans went a perfect 7-0 over the Utes on April 3 and dominated 6-1 against the Huskies on March 27. The Trojans not only beat the Bruins earlier in the year in a non-conference matchup, but USC also beat its crosstown rival in their latest contest last week by a score of 4-2.
The Trojans enter the tournament with seven wins in their last eight team matches. Seniors Jonny Wang, Eric Johnson, Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz will be making their final appearances in the Pac-12 championship, which the Trojans last won in 2012 in the tournament’s inaugural year. The Pac-12 currently has three teams in the ITA Top 25 rankings, including the Trojans, so the tournament will be an opportunity for USC to pick up any final details about their opponents that they can use at the NCAA championships.
Wang and junior Max de Vroome enter the Pac-12 championship semifinals as the leading individual players for the Trojans; Wang has won his last 12 individual matches, and de Vroome is riding an eight-match winning streak.
The Trojans also boast six players ranked in the ITA Top 100 for singles. Hanfmann currently holds the highest ranking among USC players at No. 11, followed by Quiroz at No. 22. Wang is ranked at No. 38, and sophomore Nick Crystal is ranked No. 67. De Vroome ranks No. 86, and Johnson rounds out the ITA Top 100 at     No. 100. Hanfmann and Quiroz also are ranked No. 3 by the ITA in doubles play.
Of the three teams that USC could face in the semifinals, the Bruins might be the most difficult opponent, considering they have won six of their last eight matches. In addition, the Bruins also beat the Huskies and Utes earlier this season 6-1 and 7-0, respectively. The Huskies don’t have any individual players or doubles pairings in the ITA Top 100 and are only 2-5 in conference play, while the Utes have lost six of their last seven matches.
On the other side of the bracket, the Cal Bears will await the winner of the matchup between the Oregon Ducks and the Arizona Wildcats. The Stanford Cardinal, who have a 6-1 Pac-12 record this season, will play one of those three teams in the semifinal. The Cardinal would likely not want to face the Bears, since the Bears are the only team in the Pac-12 that beat the Cardinal this season. The Ducks are only 3-4 in conference play and haven’t beaten the Bears this season, but one of their wins was against the Wildcats earlier this month by a score of 4-1. The Wildcats are winless in the          Pac-12 this year and only sport an 8-18 overall record.
If the Trojans advance to the final round, the Cardinal would most likely give them the most trouble, as the Cardinal beat the Trojans 4-3 a few weeks ago in a conference matchup. With that said, the Trojans did beat the Cardinal earlier this year 6-1 in a non-conference matchup. The other three teams — the Wildcats, Ducks and Bears — all fell to the Trojans this season.

For the past three years, I’ve been blessed to wake up almost every day and gaze at the beauty of the USC campus and all of its enchanting sights.
Whether it’s of students rushing to class on Trousdale Parkway in the mornings, groups hanging around one of the university’s 30 fountains or visitors snapping a picture in front of Tommy Trojan, it’s these iconic scenes that constantly attract directors and producers to shoot their films on campus.
Not for one second should we take for granted our ability to see these sights, though it wasn’t the visual aesthetics that lured Jake Olson to USC.
Instead, it was love — the love for USC football and the game that he loves to play so very much. Olsen, who lost his left eye when he was just 10 months old and his right eye 11 years later due to cancer, is blind, but that sure hasn’t stopped him from pursuing his lifelong dream of one day playing college football for the Trojans.
The 6-foot-4, 195-pound long snapper will get to fulfill that dream as he will “walk on” to the USC program after being admitted to the school earlier this year, according to Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times.
And according to head coach Steve Sarkisian, Olson will, one day, get his shot to snap on the field in the game for the Trojans.
When that time comes, I can’t even fathom how freaking cool it will be to see Olsen line up and spiral the ball to the holder be teed up for one or three points.
This is one of those feel good stories that can only touch your heart and make you so proud to be a member of the Trojan Family.
It started more than five years ago when after Olsen learned that he would be losing eye sight for good, the one thing that he wished for was to see a USC football game one last time.
Head coach Pete Carroll and the 2009 Trojans would make that wish come true when the team took Olsen under their wing to make sure that he saw and took part in everything to do with USC football. His last night before the surgery would also be spent at a USC practice, which concluded with all of the players and coaches huddling around him.
Who knew that one day Olson would get another chance to take the grass at Howard Jones Field — this time in a cardinal and gold uniform. In 2015, we will have the privilege of getting to see that moment take place.
Meanwhile, Olson will be feeling the leather of the football, while brushing it up against the grass to ensure his ensuing snap gets delivered into the right hands.
USC will be welcoming the 18-year-old Olsen as a Swim With Mike scholarship recipient, which is awarded annually to physically challenged athletes at universities across the nation.
Olson overcame all odds to make the football team at Orange Lutheran High School in Southern California, and his passion and persistence to get to where he is today serves as an inspiration to us all.
His ability to work toward achieving a lifelong dream also reminds us that people with disabilities are no different from those who are without them.
Olson is a prime example of that, though he is definiltey not alone. There are thousands of physically challenged athletes across the nation that all excel in their respective sports or disciplines.
Just a couple of weeks ago, I had the privilege of playing in a wheelchair basketball tournament, in which both physically handicapped and able-bodied players participated.
As someone who normally plays basketball standing, running and jumping using my two legs, it sure wasn’t easy, and I gained so much respect for those who had no choice to adapt to playing the game they loved while in a wheelchair.
Nonetheless, I had such an incredible time and definitley feel that there should be more sports and activities that are integrated for athletes with and without disabilities.
This is just another instance of the power that sports have to bring different people together and inspire others in the process.
I know it’s an overused cliche, but it’s not always all about  wins and losses. It’s not always about all of the awards and records.
Rather, it’s about the chance to be a part of something that is bigger than yourself.
Olson may very well see the field in a USC uniform only one time during his career, but that’s not before he already inspires the rest of Trojan family.
Not letting something out of his control get in the way of his dreams surely  embodies what it means to be a Trojan — to fight on.
Olson won’t be able to see his fellow students and the rest of the Trojan faithful cheering him on at the Coliseum when he steps onto that field, but I’m sure he will not only hear, but feel the thunderous roars of admiration and excitement from the crowd.
It’s the least we can do for showing us what it means to fight on.

As the Women of Troy shift from the regular season to the Pac-12 singles and doubles championships, the women’s tennis program are considered to be legitimate contenders to win this year’s national championship.
In a sporting year filled with hard-luck losses from football, disappointing starts from the basketball program and a last-minute loss in the national championship game from men’s water polo, it’s now down to the spring sports to extend the Trojans’ unprecedented streak of winning championships.
The last time USC went without a team national championship was back in 2006, another season highlighted by an overtime loss in the water polo national championship. But for the first time since 1985, then led by seven-time national championship coach Dave Borelli, the women’s tennis program has the pieces in place to add a nice shiny trophy to the collection.
There has been plenty of success in recent memory coming from one tennis squad, as Peter Smith has powered the men’s program to championships in four of the past five years, including USC’s record 100th title last season.
Title No. 101 has been hard to find, but leave it to a squad that struggles to handle its own success to bring USC back on the championship stage.
The season has been filled with bumps and bruises along the way, yet a perfect mark in Pac-12 play speaks to the effective mix of veteran leadership and emergent freshmen making their presence felt on the service line.
The Women of Troy opened the season ranked 14th in the country, dropping their first match against No. 10-ranked Virginia, in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships featuring some of the best programs in the NCAA.
This program has responded, capping off an undefeated       Pac-12 slate (10-0) with a    come-from-behind win over 12th-ranked UCLA in dramatic fashion on Senior Day, avenging one of only three losses on the season.
The match came right down to the wire, featuring a freshman star in the making. That would be No. 78-ranked Madison Westby, who ended a nearly five-hour dog fight with an emphatic 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-4 victory. That was just one of the many gutsy performances from the Women of Troy on the singles court, pushing five of the six singles matches to the full three-set allotment.
USC was trailing 3-1, a score that would require three-straight wins on the singles court to survive, and the Women of Troy did just that to overcome the No. 5-ranked Bruins.
That’s the moment where the championship mantra shifted from just chatter to real matter for the Women of Troy.
“More than just being great tennis players, they have great hearts,” said senior Zoe Scandalis. “[And] It’s just super exciting to see where we are now going.”
USC has no player ranked higher than 13th overall, which happens to be Giuliana Olmos, who won the Pac-12 singles title last season, but you’d be hard pressed to find a squad as balanced.
All six starters are currently ranked inside the top 80 seeds in the country, and the starting lineup features three freshmen, two seniors and a talented sophomore, Zoe Katz, providing a unique mix of experience and youth for coach Richard Gallien.
For what they lack in top-ranked talent, USC is propelled by the captivating energy and bubbly personality of their fiery captain, Sabrina Santamaria, who enters her final postseason with pedigree as the 2013 NCAA doubles champion.
Add to the fact that most enthusiastic finisher, Olmos, has held down the fort with a 9-0 record in the No. 2 slot, and the Women of Troy have the makings of a battle tested one-two punch.
Then insert the talented freshmen trio of Gabby Smith, Madison Westby and Meredith Xepoleas, a two-time Pac-12 Player of the Week, and the Women of Troy have a lineup that plays tough on every court, even when they are not playing their best tennis during a given match.
The Women of Troy (21-2) have now reeled off wins in 17 of their last 18 matches entering the Pac-12 championships, where UCLA,
California and Stanford  remain serious threats. Not only have they won, they’ve found ways to grind out close contests: winning five of those matches in tight 4-3 fashion.
Despite not actually winning a national championship in recent memory, USC’s squad has taken their best shot at the title over the past two seasons.
Just last year, the 16th-seeded Trojans went into Athens, Georgia, the host site for NCAA’s, and took top-seeded Georgia down to the wire, losing 4-3 as Scandalis was bested in a thrilling 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (5) match to decide the winner.
That eventual loss, which Scandalis places firmly on her shoulders, remains a motivational tool for her final run at the tournament coming up next month.
“Oh totally,” Scandalis said, watching the men’s team win four of the last five national championships. “And then everyday we see the number of championships [they’ve won], and it’s definitely a reminder.”
But during those final moments, USC also learned a great deal from watching men’s tennis play against massive expectations to win the national title as the top seed.
While USC has plenty of chances to win No. 101 in a variety of spring sports, the most entertaining team on the circuit has the best chance of pulling off another dramatic postseason run in the 64-team tournament.
The Women of Troy might  just catch the collegiate tennis world by surprise, as long as that doesn’t involve physically catching the crown.

The No. 5 men and No. 4 women’s track teams are both ranked in the top five of the national rankings for the first time since 2008. Part of the reason for this recent spike in success is a fresh load of talent for the Trojans.
For the week of April 13-19, three Trojans earned Pac-12 Athlete of the Week honors.  A USC track and field athlete has won 11 of the 20 Pac-12 awards given out thus far this season.  Junior sprinter Andre De Grasse of Ontario Canada, won his second award of the season following a dazzling performance at the Mt. SAC Relays on April 18.
The sprinter won the 100-meter, 200-meter and was a member of the winning 4×100-meter relay team.
De Grasse ran the 100-meter in only 9.87 seconds which is not only a new personal best, but also the fastest time in the world this season under any conditions.  De Grasse then moved on to the 200-meter where he finished first ahead of a field of professionals once again setting a new personal record with a time of 20.16.  The time also ties the Canadian record held by Aaron Brown.
De Grasse now sits at third all-time on the USC 200-meter list.  He also holds the fastest times in the country in both the 100-meter and 200-meter this season.
USC’s relay team became the first collegiate team since 2002 and the second team in the last 29 years to win the 4×100-meter relay at Mt. SAC.
The event is composed of a significant number of professionals, but this year USC proved up to the challenge.  The wining time was 38.98.  De Grasse led off for the Trojans, followed by senior BeeJay Lee, junior Just’N Thymes and anchored by Bryan Mercado.
Conor McCullough, a redshirt senior thrower for the Trojans, also received his second Pac-12 Athlete of the Week honor.  McCullough won the men’s Invitational Hammer Throw competition which was also held at the Mt. SAC relays on April 18.  McCullough’s best throw was a 241-9, a distance long enough for third farthest in USC history.
It is also the third longest throw by an American man this year and 16th in the world overall.
Junior discus thrower Tera Novy was named the Pac-12 Women’s Field Athlete of the Week after winning the discus throw competition at the Cal State L.A. Twilight Meet on April 16.
Novy set both a new personal best and a new USC school record with her throw of 193-10.  The previous school record had stood since 2006.
Ahead for the Women of Troy is the Triton Invitational held in La Jolla on April 24 at which only the women’s throwers will be competing.
The next competition for the entire team will come on May 3 when USC hosts the annual     USC-UCLA dual meet.
The meet will also be when USC’s 20 seniors receive their honors and farewells.

Everyone has had the problem of wanting to take a selfie, but not want wanting to whip out the selfie stick, which has become a social faux pas. Enter Mega Tiny Corp, which has introduced a new take on the hands-free selfie with an iPhone case that sticks to any surface. Marshall graduate Wannie Park is leading Mega Tiny Corp’s charge in releasing newer and cooler products into the arena.
Mega Tiny Corp is currently fundraising money on Kickstarter for its Zero G iPhone 6 and 6 Plus case. The initial goal was to raise $25,000, but it has already achieved more than 370 percent over that goal at over $117.776 with 7 days to go on the Kickstarter. The Zero G case is advertised to use nano-suction technology so that users can stick their phone to any smooth, flat surface, including, but not limited to, whiteboards, metal, glass and computer screens while still viably protecting the phone from damage. This case is the first product that Mega Tiny Corp has uniquely designed, tested and created for the market.
Park said the case is what this startup tech accessories company wishes to focus on in the future.
“For us, and [with] my background in consumer electronics — I’ve been doing this since 2003 — I know this space really well. The Zero G case is actually the first product we really developed intensely, and in terms of where we’re headed, it’s going to be a lot more of [these] inspired, innovative products,” Park said.
Park co-founded Mega Tiny Corp following years of experience in the tech accessory industry. After beginning his career at Belkin International in 2003, Park left to start his own company.
“I was in corporate development for Belkin International,” Park said. “That is how I got started in terms of the accessories side of the business. It wasn’t just coming up with new products — you have to build it, test it, make it beautiful, and you have to sell it. I have a ton of experience selling into retail. And taking all these different elements of my experience and bringing it forth to this company that I’ve started has been great.”
Tech accessories are currently on the rise. With Samsung, Apple and Oculus, the industry has fostered innovation but has proven difficult to break into. In the case of Mega Tiny Corp, Park utilized his previous career experience at Belkin International and harnessed the power of the Trojan family. Park has reached out for help from other alumni, and other Trojans have in turn also reached out to him to collaborate. Park encouraged students to realize the full potential of the resources that USC can offer.
“One of the best things about Marshall is that if I were to go through the online alumni directory, and I reach out and cold call a Marshall alum, there is a really good shot that the guy will answer my call or return my email,” Park said. “There is that sort of bond. My advice is to reach out and tap into the alumni network, and don’t be afraid to cold call a person and engage them.”
Park said that increased globalization and interconnectedness has allowed for any entrepreneur or creative innovator to break into any industry. For the Zero G case, he was able to easily continue his relationship with China manufacturers. His company had access to materials, factories and manufacturers, even though Park is based in Los Angeles. Mega Tiny Corp is an example of how startups can remain successful and competitive by utilizing global resources and human capital strategically.
“If you’re inspired, it’s really not as hard as you think,” Park said. “This case seems simple, but the world has gotten so much smaller that from here in Los Angeles, I’m able to talk to people in Japan and in China, all the places to get all the little pieces to build this case. There are more moving parts than you think, and just really an issue of getting out there, and being brave — don’t worry about rejection. Be brave and aggressive.”

Fifty years ago, the Watts riots broke out in Los Angeles, warranting national media attention. The combination of the Watts riots and more contemporary events such as the Rodney King riots has given the area around USC a bit of a bad reputation.
This isn’t new or shocking information, it’s simply a fact -— many people believe our surrounding neighborhood is dangerous. Overbearing parents of potential students ask about safety measures and crime rates just as much as they ask about academics and dorms.
In my humble opinion, this media attention has contributed to a hesitancy among students to explore the neighborhoods immediately surrounding us. Students pile into their cars or onto the Metro and travel directly to Downtown, Hollywood or Westwood, without exploring South Los Angeles.
Sixty-one years ago, a man named Simon Rodia completed the Watts Towers, the Watts neighborhood’s other, more positive claim to fame. The Watts Towers are a world-renowned public art sculpture, designated as both a California Historical Landmark and a National Historic Landmark. It’s also included on the National Register of Historic Places.
This iconic historical sight is just a 15-minute drive from campus, accessible via the 110 South. Or, if you use public transportation (as you should), take the Blue Line to the convenient 103rd Street/Watts Towers Metro station.
The towers are tucked away in a residential neighborhood. Towers reaching as high as 90 feet loom over small, single-story homes. The towers are steel structures, coated with various glass materials. The resulting mosaic exudes a whimsical, do-it-yourself feel, similar to the lesser-known Salvation Mountain in Slab City.
Imperfect and impressive, the towers represent the life’s work of Rodia, an Italian immigrant and construction worker. It took Rodia more than 30 years to complete work on the towers, beginning in 1921 and ending in 1954. In 1955, however, Rodia moved out of the Watts neighborhood, leaving his towers behind. He died 10 years later and never returned to the project he worked meticulously on for three decades.
Rodia’s primary motivation for the towers was simply to do something for his neighborhood. In the 2006 documentary about Rodia, I Build the Tower, the unintentional artist says, “I build the tower people like, everybody come.”
The towers are only accessible to the public via tours on the weekends. Unfortunately, we didn’t visit on a tour day, so we could only admire them from outside the locked fence. We were still able to appreciate Rodia’s impressive artistry in all its towering glory, however.
The towers were constructed out of steel, then coated with concrete and wrapped in wire mesh. Rodia built the towers without scaffolding, machine equipment or drawing boards, instead relying on simple tools and creativity. Embedded in the concrete are various glass materials, all from “found objects.” A “found object” is exactly what it sounds like — an object Rodia found and then added to his ever-expanding art project. Pieces of porcelain, tile and glass, from objects including bottles, seashells and mirrors, decorate the tower. Hardly a reclusive artist, Rodia often used items brought to him from neighborhood children.
Rodia’s love for his neighborhood is shown in the name he originally gave the towers, “Nuestro Pueblo,” or “Our Town.”
The towers’ colorful presence has made an impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Homes that border the towers are equally colorful — some are painted with bright colors or designs, and many feature bright, blooming flowers. A few homes even feature their own mosaics.
A park space now surrounds the towers, completing Rodia’s vision of his work as a community gathering space. At just 0.11 acres, the space is California’s smallest state park.
Surrounding the towers is a circle of benches, positioned perfectly to gaze up at the towers. The land also includes the Watts Towers Arts Center, which provides art classes to children from the community and showcases work from local artists.
A hidden gem within a hidden gem, the ground surrounding the towers features an extensive timeline of the history of the Watts neighborhood. Starting with the indigenous Indians who occupied California as early as 10,000 B.C., and ending with the completion of the Imperial-Wilmington Metro Line in 1998, the timeline provides everything you could possibly know about South Los Angeles history.
The Watts Towers aren’t as obscure as most places I’ve covered. Most USC students have probably already heard of the towers, but I figured everyone needed a little extra encouragement to venture into the area surrounding our campus. The Watts Towers’ proximity to USC and prominence in Los Angeles culture make it a must-visit for students. Through this column, I’ve encouraged readers to visit random locations across the Los Angeles region. As students of Los Angeles, we also need to engage with the community directly around us, and the Watts Towers provide a perfect place to start.
The Watts Towers are open to the public for tours on Thursdays through Sundays.
Erin Rode is a freshman majoring in environmental engineering and print and digital journalism. Her column, “The Rode Less Traveled,” runs Thursdays.
“The combination of the Watts riots and more contemporary events such as the Rodney King riots has given the area around USC a bit of a bad reputation.” No, the random killing of Chinese students, gang violence in general, the Halloween 2012 shooting on campus by a non-student and the overall lawlessness surrounding the campus is responsible for ‘earned’ bad reputation. It is completely irresponsible for you to suggest public transportation to Watts (which also requires walking a few blocks to the Towers)
when doing so unnecessarily puts lives at risk! Go by car (know where you’re going) if you must – and do so only on tour dates. SC students are not in LA to ‘engage’ the community. The communities needs are irrelevant unless your aim is social work and not an education for which enormous sums are being extracted from parents who could give a rats-ass about social engagement.

When one thinks of Los Angeles-area film festivals, the Newport Beach Film Festival isn’t the first to come to mind. With Hollywood just a short drive up the 101, a affluent beach town a good ways down the 405 doesn’t strike one as the first choice for a film festival.
Nonetheless, the town of 87,000 has hosted a yearly film festival since 1999. The festival has developed a reputation as a home for quality films away from the bustle of the city. Perhaps its most notable screening was the U.S. premiere of 2005 Best Picture winner Crash. With critically-acclaimed prestige pieces, horror films, family films and classic film retrospectives, the festival might actually live up to the oft-repeated claim of “having something for everyone.”
Held from April 23 through April 27, the festival will kick off Thursday night with a presentation of the decorated directorial debut of Russell Crowe, The Water Diviner. The film follows Crowe’s character as he travels to Turkey to discover the fate of his three sons at the infamous Battle of Gallipoli. The film won three awards, including Best Film, at this year’s AACTAs, the Australian equivalent of the Oscars. Crowe’s performance has been lauded as a vintage performance for the Oscar-winning star.
Friday’s slate is highlighted by a showing of the Michael Fassbender western Slow West. The film follows a young Scottish teenager, played by Nightcrawler actor Kodi Smit-McPhee, as he travels across the untamed west. He soon meets Fassbender’s character, a road-weary cowboy who agrees to protect the teenager as he seeks to avoid the aggressions of bandits on the road. The trailer is a treat, featuring a fiery guitar track over numerous stylized gunfights and beautiful cinematography reminiscent of Roger Deakins’s work in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.
Slow West will not be the only great film on display on Friday however. Set Fire to the Stars features Elijah Wood playing an aspiring poet who spends a week with Dylan Thomas. In A Little Chaos, Kate Winslet plays a landscape designer in the 18th century court of Louis XIV. She is sucked into a vortex of court intrigue and romance. Also, the first of three free film retrospectives will be screened, with a showing of classic cheerleading film Bring It On.
Saturday features another intriguing slate of films. Perhaps the most interesting screening set for display is the 7 p.m. screening of A Nightmare on Short Street, which is a collection of critically-acclaimed horror short films. With horror usually getting the short end of the critical stick, it is refreshing to see a horror presentation at a relatively prestigious film festival. If anything, a screening like this will end up feeling like a better version of those horror anthology films, such as The ABCs of Death, which have gained popularity recently.
There are other films to watch out for on Saturday’s slate. For example, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl currently boasts a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score. The film follows a high schooler, played by Project X actor Thomas Mann, as he befriends a cancer-striken classmate payed by Olivia Cooke. Slow Learners has the makings of a charming romantic comedy, starring two unlucky-in-love friends who go take a vow to turn their lives around.
Sunday features one of the biggest draws of this year’s festival: the Orson Welles centennial celebration. Celebrating the Citizen Kane master’s long career, his adaptation of Othello will be screened at 11 a.m., followed by a portrayal of Welles by Danny Huston in Fade to Black. These will be followed by an in-depth panel discussion on Welles’ life, with particular emphasis on his life abroad.
The festival will continue into the week with day-by-day tour of the world. Monday starts things off with a showcase of films from around the Pacific Rim. Korea’s A Hard Day, China’s Don’t Go Breaking My Heart 2 and Japan’s Twilight: Saya in Sasara will comprise the lineup for this celebration. Tuesday will feature a European showcase. This will include Sweden’s Blowfly Park, France’s Love at First Sight, Italy’s Do You Remember Me and Germany’s Who Am I: No System is Safe. Wednesday concludes the tour with a Latino films selection. Chile’s El Cordero, Brazil’s A Despedida and Mexico’s One for the Road make up the lineup.
On Thursday, the eighth and final night of the festival, the closing night film will be No Stranger than Love. A romantic plot, mixed with inter dimensional travel, the film appears to be a charming genre-straddling flick. Starring the very talented Alison Brie, the film looks to be a refreshing change of pace to close out the film festival.

This letter is written in response to the April 8 Letter to the Editor that ran in the Daily Trojan.
USC takes great pride in its efforts to provide substantial services, aids and academic adjustments for its students with disabilities. The staff in the Disabilities Services and Programs office work closely with students in need of accommodations, providing not only the adjustments requested but often additional accommodations, in order to create a better USC experience for all who contact that office.
In addition, the university spends over one million dollars each year in construction, both on existing buildings and newer ones, related specifically to barrier removal and easier access and mobility for students in wheelchairs, or with other mobility-related challenges.  This construction is prioritized with the input from facilities leadership and staff, access and universal design experts and administrators from Disability Services and Programs, the Office of Equity and Diversity, and the university’s Accessibility Advisory Committee.
The university aims to exceed code requirements for accessibility.  The new University Village project will have more residential units with accessible mobility features than required by code.  USC Housing voluntarily renovates units each summer, increasing the number of apartments with full mobility features.
We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with our students and broader university community partners to address these critical issues.

Earlier this month, Buzzfeed published an article about a viral Facebook post from college student Erica Edgerly. The post featured a picture of Edgerly’s younger sister Macy, a high school honors student and senior in Texas, wearing leggings and a loose, almost knee-length shirt. In the post, Edgerly revealed that her sister was sent home from school wearing those clothes. She slammed the school for judging girls on the basis of their clothes.      Edgerly said, “People wonder why women feel insecure about their bodies or what they wear … And it’s because you’re told your clothing is inappropriate when you’re fully clothed, even when you’re not showing cleavage or anything.” Edgerly went on to say that the mentality of her sister’s school administration contributed to patriarchy and rape culture in today’s society. These problems are deeply rooted, Edgerly concluded, and they are more important than punishing girls on basis of dress code policies.
The post was shared over 80,000 times within a week. As a result, a very important dialogue has been opened about sexism and misogyny in K-12 schools. After all, this issue certainly isn’t restricted to this one Texas high school. In summer 2014, there was a nationwide movement in which students staged walk-outs at their schools to protest perceived sexist dress codes perpetuating a mindset that led to “slut shaming” of high school girls and, ultimately, rape culture. This made an impact. By September 2014, #Iammorethanadistraction was trending on Twitter.
Many schools throughout the United States have limitations on the dress code. These restrictions can range from the requirement of formal attire or the banning of certain items of clothing, like spaghetti straps and leggings. Sometimes these laws interfere with students’ self-expression, but most of the time, they are implemented to uphold a productive learning environment. What has become apparent, however, is that restrictions on student attire are sexist and degrading to the female population. It is not the responsibility of the school to restrict girls on something so harmless such as what they choose to wear.
It could be said that school dress codes walk a very fine line. How one should dress is very much dependent on certain settings. People’s appearance definitely contribute to how they are perceived. For that reason, dressing appropriately is an important skill to learn, and while freedom of expression should never be oppressed, pretending that anyone can wear any article of clothing and not be judged is too idealistic. In the end, though, it all comes down to the reasoning the school provides. Dress codes put in place on grounds of developing future professionalism are justifiable. If any female student is told what to wear to pacify male counterparts, however, a serious problem becomes apparent. Indeed, girls are more than just a distraction.
Thus, the dress code rules punish girls for boys’ lack of self control. On the grander scale, these restrictions will contribute to the justification of sexual assault. The gross notion that women, when provocatively dressed, are “asking for it” starts with something seemingly benign such as sending a student home for how she is dressed.
It is simply unacceptable to shame girls and women in this way. Though telling girls that they cannot dress a certain way because it may be distracting might seem like a small thing to many schools, the principles underlying it are very serious. As dress code restrictions unfairly target the female student body, it suggests that girls are seen as physical objects and that women only serve the desires of men. In a learning environment, a girl’s responsibility is to be a student who should have to worry about getting sent home for how she dresses.
Women are more than their clothes. Hillary Clinton is more than a pantsuit; female actresses are more than their red carpet moments and female students are more than the dress code.

Last week, China released five feminist activists who were arrested on March 8, on International Women’s Day. These women were arrested for attempts to organize protesters and hand out fliers protesting sexual harassment in China. In an autocratic regime like China, it is unsurprising to see dissenters to the status quo censored. What is surprising is the fact that China released the activists a little over a month later. The incident highlights the issue of human rights that China must confront in its meteoric rise as a global force. As its nascent career as a superpower continues, China must now contend with the previously avoided problems.
After the arrest, the international community criticized the Chinese government heavily. Secretary of State John Kerry and his predecessor Hillary Clinton both voiced their displeasure and called for the immediate release of the five women. The West often calls for the release of dissidents imprisoned for their cry for freedom, and it usually takes time for a release to happen, if one ever occurs. It might appear that China is warming up to opposition with the relatively quick release, but the ultimate reason behind the act is the international image the country is trying to paint ahead of U.N. meeting on women’s right being hosted in the country in September.
This U.N. meeting might be a quick fix for China in the short run, but it can no longer kick the can down the road. As an industrialized country gaining political, economic and military clout, it no longer is a standalone country but a model for surrounding countries and even the world. Sexual harassment is a major issue in China, and the oppression of women is a disgraceful act that must cease to exist.
The last time China released official figures in 2005, it reported 15,000 rapes. In 2007, however, the United States listed the number closer to 31,000. China has an egregious sexual harassment problem, and it is time China addresses violence against women. Hosting a conference for the U.N. is not nearly enough. In 1995, it hosted a women’s rights conference where Hillary Clinton gave an impassioned and historic speech on the rights for women across the world, and yet gender discrimination obviously is still a problem in China.
China disavows any notion of dissidence, either political or social. When it comes to economics, however, the country has oddly enough been open to laissez-faire policies and practices. If China is willing to reform its economy, then it must take responsibility to reform other facets of the country as well.
The five women activists arrested were attempting to shed light on the horrendous instances of groping on public transportation and in other public spaces. They have also brought attention to domestic violence as well as the gender discrimination evident in university admissions by shaving their heads, occupying men’s bathrooms to highlight the unequal ratio of stalls. Handing out fliers was their latest attempt to inform people about rampant rape in the country. The arrest, however, mimics the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, where China proved to the world that free speech is not welcome. The economic juggernaut has used its power to censor the Internet and tailor thought and discourse in the country away from the issues it struggles with.
Feminism and gender bias do not take place in China alone. Even in the United States, the fight for equal women’s rights is are from over. Given that rape culture  is prominent on college campuses, women only earn 78 cents compared to every dollar men earn and traditional gender biases still present in public and private institutions, America has a fight of its own.
As the two largest superpowers in the world, the onus is on China and the United States to confront these human right offenses of sexism and gender discrimination. The brave and courageous acts of the five women’s rights activists should continue, and the United States must continue to support their efforts. China has made huge strides in the past several decades, transforming from a rural, subsistence economy to a bustling interntional marketplace. That growth, however, must be paralleled by an equally revolutionary metamorphosis from a socially hierarchical lifestyle to a more open, equal society.

On April 8, LGBT discrimination in workplaces associated with the federal government will be prohibited due to an executive order signed by President Barack Obama. The order is expected to impact 24,000 companies and 28 million people, nearly one-fifth of the U.S. workforce.
Though Obama has made it clear that he hopes to move the nation closer to equality in many aspects, a minority of young adults in the United States is still struggling to be accepted by a larger majority. Particularly, college students who identify with the transgender community face an unfair internal conflict: which restroom they will use in public. This is a problem that all college campuses should work to remedy.
Most individuals usually do not experience anxiety when choosing to use the restroom in public, but for individuals who get clocked (pegged for being transgender or transvestite), it might put them in an uncomfortable or even dangerous position. A variety of public locations such as schools have granted the right to transgender people to use whichever restroom they are most comfortable in, but even with this improvement, transgender people and other restroom users might find the bathroom situation uncomfortable.
As a solution, schools are creating gender-neutral restrooms. Some states and individual schools allow students to use the bathroom they are most comfortable with or provide students with a genderless option rather than force them to choose between male or female. There has been immense backlash, however, to the point where bills are being drafted to completely counteract the acceptance of transgender students and infringe upon their right to choose an appropriate bathroom.
Frank Artiles, a state representative from Florida, recently filed HB 583 to “ensure the public’s safety.” If passed, the bill would prevent transgender Floridians from using their restroom of choice. According to USA Today College, people who knowingly enter public bathrooms made for members of the opposite sex could receive a 60-day jail sentence and a $500 fine. It’s a bill that could affect students in private and public universities.
Artiles claims that the bill is not meant to discriminate. Rather, the intent is to protect public safety. But Artiles does not take into account the safety of transgender students. Not only are suicide rates the highest among the transgender population, but many also face verbal and physical harassment and assault. A binary gender system could leave many facing mental and social distress in addition to physical harm, including self-inflicted harm.
Some colleges have taken a more accepting role in terms of gender discrimination. Wellesley is one school that has recently joined the list of elite women’s colleges that have altered their acceptance policies to accommodate transgender students. Mills College has also decided to accept a broader definition of “female.” According to the college, “Womanhood takes many forms, and our enrolled women students include those who were assigned the sex of female at birth as well as those who were not.”
Certain religious colleges, however, have made it even more  difficult for transgenders by denying them housing based on their gender identity and controlling the use of bathrooms. Their prejudice is based upon the fear that male-to-female transgender individuals use women’s restrooms for the sole purpose of preying on young girls.
At USC, there have been efforts to better accommodate the transgender population on campus, including an increase in gender-neutral private changing rooms at the Lyon Center, trans-friendly housing and more. The issue, however, is still prominent because gender-neutral bathrooms are not available everywhere. There is a need for the campus to take on this task, and any opposition would be unfounded.
Ultimately, transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals cannot be equal members of society until they are granted the right to use the public restroom of their choosing. A movement towards acceptance of the transgender community is growing, but it is going to take new non-discriminatory laws and a new mindset before true equality can be achieved.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that gender-neutral bathrooms are unavailable at USC. Some gender-neutral bathrooms are actually available. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
The position taken in this article is disturbing.  As I have reported before, we as a society must stop this nonsense as quickly and firmly as possible.  There is one problematic assertion after another presented by this author.  As a gay male myself, I can assure everyone that sexual orientation is not a choice.  However, being a transgender is indeed a choice, and it is not society’s burden or responsibility to accommodate the discomfort or internal conflict that results from a transgender’s decision.  Do you really want to be progressive and forward thinking?  Then it’s time to understand that not identifying with your birth gender is a PROBLEM.  It is NOT normal and should not be “normalized” in our society.
To begin with, the “binary gender system” is science and biology at its purest.  It is not a construct of society.  There are two genders… not three or four or anything else.  I am a gay male, therefore I use the men’s restrooms.  Period.  You want to discuss the “rights” or discomfort of a transgender person when it comes to using a restroom?  What about the rights and comfort of others who encounter a gender-confused person of the opposite sex standing beside him at a urinal?  The author’s point of view is frankly disgusting, and much of the transgender movement is purely selfish, and designed to change social constructs for the benefit of a very, very small minority of people who have a disorder.
What is further disturbing and unfounded is this notion that society should be moved in anyway by the “fear” or confusion a transgender person undergoes when “choosing” which restroom to use.  Really?!?!  Everything about a transgender person involves choice… THEIR choice!  If you choose to live like the opposite sex, or even more drastically, if you choose to surgically alter yourself to live like the opposite sex, then you must live with the consequences of your choices.  Sorry, but I am not here to help you sort through the horrendous confusion within your mind… but I am here to tell you that MY rights, and the rights of “normal” people who are not conflicted by their own sexuality are not to be trampled on because of your selfishness.
Now, as I’ve also said before:  People with gender identity disorders should be treated with the same sort of love and respect as anyone with a disorder.  They absolutely should NOT be bullied or physically harmed.  They are to be loved like we would love any human being.  But we need to move away from this idea that telling someone “NO” is somehow not loving or respecting them.  But let’s be clear:  Accommodating someone with a handicap is not at all the same as accommodating someone who is transgender because bathrooms are ground zero for issues of privacy and discretion.  The fact that a transgender person is struggling with those issues does not mean that I or anyone else should sacrifice my rights to privacy, discretion and comfort.
If you are transgender and still struggling with which bathroom to use, let me help you out:  First, seek restrooms that are designed for one person at a time.  They are everywhere.  Hard to find?  Not my problem. That is a burden you have brought upon yourself.  If there is a not such a restroom nearby, then choose the restroom that matches how you have chosen to present yourself, and use it discreetly so as not to make OTHERS in that restroom uncomfortable.
Executive orders are not binding on non-federal government entities. Is your university a government entity? Are your staff and employees paid by tax dollars? It is precisely the wrong assumption that the federal government has power over people living in the USA that grants the federal government more power that it has under the law.
Restrooms are not free. How much will USC (students and donors) have to spend to  accommodate the 1% that is LGBT? The enactment of the federal ADA and the similar changes to California’s Title 24 for accessibility have created an industry of modifications of buildings in advance of lawsuits and as response to lawsuits. Who benefited the most financially? Not the end users. It is nice to accommodate the disabled, but at what price? The disabled are a much larger group than the LGBT community. Should LGBT be allowed to sue like the disabled? Is accommodation of the LGBT community meant to be a tax on everyone for the choices of a few? Should not the LGBT community be financially responsible for their choices? 
How different is LGBT accommodation in a male/female world and the  accommodation of natural gas/electric vehicles in a gasoline car world? The male/female world was built over centuries. The gasoline car world was built over a century. How much should the members of the male/female world pay to transform the world to accommodate LGBT choice? How much should the gasoline car world pay to accommodate the natural gas/electric car choice?

The area between 28th Street, 30th Street, Hoover Street and Figueroa Street was shut down Wednesday afternoon after a suspect in an armed robbery fled from police.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff Department apprehended the suspect, who was hiding between the Delta Gamma and Tau Kappa Epsilon houses on The Row, at approximately 5 p.m.
According to Jeff Onoa, shift supervisor at CVS Pharmacy on Figueroa Street and 32nd Street, a suspect pulled a gun on a woman outside the store. The woman ran inside the store, while the suspect fled north toward 28th Street. The incident was captured on surveillance footage.
“She ran into the store and that’s what scared some of our customers,” Onoa said.
Onoa said there was no attempt made to rob the store.
Witnesses said that the suspect ran from near the Phi Kappa Psi house across 28th Street, then crawled into an area where dumpsters are kept behind Delta Gamma.
Daniel Turner, Tau Kappa Epsilon’s facilities manager, found the suspect crouched in the alley between Delta Gamma and Tau Kappa Epsilon.
“Behind DG and the next building … I was back there cleaning up, [and] I walked over there and there he was crouched down,” Turner said. “I told him ‘You better come out before the police shoot you.’ Pretty soon he came out and the cops were waiting right there. They apprehended him and put him in handcuffs.”
Daniel Wagner, a sophomore majoring in international relations, witnessed the suspect being taken into custody from inside Tau Kappa Epsilon and noticed he was injured.
“Our facilities manager went outside, and he saw a trail of blood and followed it … He saw the shooter crouching there … His whole leg was bleeding out,” Wagner said.
The cause of his injuries are unknown.
A Trojan Alert was sent out at 4:55 warning students to stay clear of the area. A second Trojan Alert was sent at 5:35 stated that the incident was resolved and the area was safe.

With the year winding down, many of us are struggling to care for ourselves. As I’m sure most of you have encountered some moldy food this semester, it’s important to keep an eye on perishable foods. But before tossing out a common food that you think is about to go bad, reconsider.
Bananas are a staple in my diet, but once they brown faster than I can eat them, the brownish and squishy bananas all of a sudden become all too unappealing. But instead of throwing away the overly ripened bananas, try to repurpose them.

Ingredients:
Yellow Cake Mix
2 eggs
3­4 overripe bananas
1/2 – ­1 cup chocolate chips, nuts, etc. (optional)
Simply mash the bananas first, and then add your cake mix, eggs, and any additional ingredients. Stir until well combined. Spray either two small or one large loaf pan and pour the mixture into the pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes if using smaller pans, and longer for the larger pan. It’s as easy as that.

One of the easiest ways to use up a browned banana is by throwing it into the blender. Bananas are the base of a majority of smoothies due to the creamy texture and flavor they give to a smoothie. For a classic peanut butter and banana smoothie, blend a ripened banana or two with some yogurt or milk, ice, peanut butter and/or vanilla and honey.

5. Ice cream. If you don’t have a popsicle mold, no worries! You can still indulge in guilt­free “ice cream” by freezing your ripened bananas first. Blend (I use a food processor) frozen chunks of bananas until smooth. You can stop here and enjoy a creamy, sweet “ice cream” or continue on by adding some of my favorites like peanut butter or cocoa powder or even both. These additions will give your banana ice cream richer flavor.
So, back away from the garbage and pull out some baking or blending equipment. Your bananas might look bad on the outside, but they can still make for a delicious treat regardless of looks. Try some of these easy recipes to save your money spent on bananas and to enjoy them in a different, non-­traditional way!
