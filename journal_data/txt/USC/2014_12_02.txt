Undergraduate Student Government approved a resolution at their meeting Tuesday evening that would raise the organization’s programming fee by $1.50 each semester. The student programming fee is used to fund on-campus events, such as Conquest! and Springfest.

USG’s unanimous approval of the resolution was spurred by the the findings of a Student Programming Fee Committee. USG Treasurer Julie Stripe, who presented on behalf of the committee, said that the current fee hasn’t been raised in four years and doesn’t account for inflation.
The committee, made up of USG members and a “student at large,” researched other universities’ programming budgets. They looked at the comparative costs of events, such as concerts, in determining that the programming fee should be raised.
The committee also took into account the results of semester course evaluations, which ask whether students would agree to a slight increase in tuition for programming events.
“Sixty-four percent of students agreed they would like to have an increase in the fee,” Stripe said.
On the basis of its findings, the committee recommended raising the fee by $1.50 per semester. Though the amount could have been higher, USC stipulates that the combined growth of the student services fee, student programming fee and student health service fee can’t exceed the percentage of growth in tuition.
“It was an increase that would be accepted by the administration,” Stripe said.
Stripe added that there can be negative consequences of increasing the fee by too high a margin.
“You don’t want to raise a fee so much that the next [USG] administration isn’t sure what to do with the money, and ends up using it inappropriately,” Stripe said.
Though an excess of funds could be problematic, USG members believe that a lack of funds is much worse. Without adequate programming fees, many students are denied funding for planned events.
“Each semester I get requests for thousands and thousands of dollars that I just can’t fill,” Stripe said. “They’re all good ideas. We just don’t have the budget.”
Stripe said that while the programming budget is currently a hindrance, it can become an asset in the future.
“We’re not able to put on the same level of events that we once were … In three years, I’d hope that we’d be able to put on all the events students want,” Stripe said.

The Los Angeles County-based event CicLAvia will be coming to South Los Angeles for the first time on Dec. 7, and streets will be closed to motor vehicles, allowing the public to bike, walk, scooter and skate through open roads in an effort to promote alternative transportation culture.

South LA CicLAvia routes will be divided into four “hubs” along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Central Avenue, connecting Leimert Park with Central Avenue. All hubs will offer merchandise, maps and information, free water, first-aid stations, restrooms and bike repair stations for minor repairs. Beginning at the northern end of the Central Avenue Hub, the route will continue into the Jazz Park, Exposition Park and Leimert Park hubs.
According to CicLAvia Communications Director Robert Gard, CicLAvia works closely with the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Deptartment and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to work out the logistics and ensure event safety. Major intersections will not be closed for the event, as each major intersection on the route will still offer crossing points for vehicles.
“We work very closely with the Los Angeles Metro and choose routes so that they are close to public transit lines to make the route easily accessible to people anywhere in L.A.,” Gard said. “[CicLAvia] teaches people that they can get around the city without the use of a car and that it’s possible to use alternative transportation, even in an urban setting.”
CicLAvia aims to connect the communities of South Los Angeles and “[catalyze] vibrant public spaces … to transform our relationship with our communities and with each other,” according to the event website. Because the route will include Exposition Park, students like Will Brotherson, a second-year student in the Gould School of Law and member of the USC Bike & Transit Law Society, will attend to support Los Angeles Critical Mass, a community bicycle ride that bills itself as the largest such event in the United States. Brotherson believes such critical mass events have the ability to influence policy and infrastructure.
“With all the public space we use, movements like LA Critical Mass and CicLAvia that encourage bike culture and improve transportation and bike infrastructure are a great way to give back to the community,” Brotherson said.
Brotherson believes events like CicLAvia prompt conversation and encourage bicycling as a fun and affordable mode of alternative transportation.
“CicLAvia and all these critical mass movements are expanding every year and becoming more and more mainstream,” Brotherson said. “A lot of people, especially in [Los Angeles], think you have to have a car, but these events are like the antidote to that mindset of car culture.”
The USC Bike Coalition has also been promoting CicLAvia, as the campus organization has participated in group rides from USC to Downtown in past CicLAvia events.
Alex Leavitt, the USC Bike Coalition’s communications coordinator, said the event is a great way to promote improvement of biking infrastructure around campus and in the greater L.A. area.
According to Leavitt, groups like the USC Bike Coalition embrace events like CicLAvia in the effort to support conversation and culture around various forms of bicycling in the hopes of making urban centers more receptive to alternative transportation.
“There have been recent calls by the city to help support infrastructural improvements for bikers and [it] just recently approved the MyFigueroa project, which would implement separated and safer bike lanes to and from campus and Downtown,” Leavitt said.

LavaLab, a student-run entrepreneurial incubator, hosted a Demo Night showcase on Tuesday, at which undergraduate teams presented final product demonstrations to peers, investors and program judges.
Earlier in the semester at LavaLab’s Pitch Night, teams delivered initial product ideas with each presentation including a problem assessment, business and marketing plan, competition analysis, product conceptualization and audience feedback. On Tuesday night, the teams revealed their second installments, after utilizing feedback from Pitch Night and developing working models.
LavaLab President Alex Zhang and Austin Spiegel, director of external relations for LavaLab helped plan and coordinate the event.
“This is my first time ever leading anything at this scale, so I was definitely nervous. I have fallen in love with this group of people, and the organization’s mission. It’s been a blast,” Zhang said.
The organization partnered with Digital LA, Cross Campus, User Experience Professionals Association of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Venture Association and Blackstone LaunchPad to bring industry professionals to campus for the event. Silicon Beach LA, USC Marshall Busines Student Government and the Undergraduate Student Government also co-sponsored the event.
One of the groups was Hexcare, an application that gathers health data from wearable devices such as Fitbit or Jawbone and aggregates the information in a user-friendly program.
“Building this product been a great experience. The stuff we are working on is unlike other apps in LavaLab because we aren’t just improving an existing program’s design. We are building a completely new platform that could impact the healthcare industry,” said team member Alex Wormuth, a senior computer science major.
The Hexcare group met with doctors and other medical professionals at USC’s Keck School of Medicine to gather feedback about their product. Team members included Wormuth, Bianca Nasser, a senior majoring in communication, Jordan Furlong, a junior majoring in business administration, and Malvika Nagpal, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration.
“We all wanted to get involved in the health industry and focus on a project that could genuinely help people,” Furlong said.
Another group that presented at the Demo Night event was cheK, a task management application that features a visually appealing display system and unique group sharing capabilities. Group members included Lea Moret, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, Alex Ogorek, a junior majoring in computer science (games), Charmaine Asril Lee, a sophomore majoring in business administration and media arts and practice, Anthony Neyer, a senior majoring in communication, and Alex Yang, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
“We’ve been meeting twice a week since the start of the semester, and it has really brought us together. We really see ourselves as a cohesive team, even though we had never met before this project began,” Yang said.
“Getting the website together and getting the application online was a high point for me this semester. It was exciting to see that we were making progress,” said Ogorek, who led the coding of the application and the prototype’s website.
Going into next semester, LavaLab hopes to foster more of community within the organization by adding retreats and other programming to the organization’s calendar.

The Undergraduate Student Government has begun conversations with the administration about the addition of a fall break into the academic calendar. Next week, USG President Andrew Menard will meet with the Academic Calendar Committee to propose a modified calendar.
“Logistics play a huge role in this project,” Menard said. “There needs to be thought given to how we would change the entire calendar that 18,000-plus students, plus faculty, will operate by, and that doesn’t happen overnight.”
Before Thanksgiving break, USG created a survey to gauge students’ interest in adding a fall break, as well as their preferences for how exactly the calendar would change and why extra days off might benefit them, potentially as a way to relieve stress. The survey received over 1,200 responses, most in support of the break.
“We wanted to get an idea of what students would want,” said Nicole Schrad, USG director of academic affairs. “Ninety-three percent of students said they would like a fall break, and 96 percent said it would be beneficial for mental health.”
Students cite many reasons for why a fall break should be implemented, among them that they need time to relax before late November, that students living far away from home should have an earlier opportunity to visit family and that many academically prestigious universities already have fall breaks. The administration at USC, Menard said, has been receptive to these points, but due to conflicts with scheduling the academic year, it has not yet created a calendar that includes such a break.
“It’s challenging for the university to implement,” Menard said. “We have to have 73 instructional days in the fall and spring, and we can’t start any earlier because of housing issues and summer school programs. It’s just a matter of coming up with a reasonable proposal that satisfies everyone.”
Students outside of USG were also instrumental in getting this project off of the ground, including Christina Nour, a junior majoring in civil engineering, who first wrote a Facebook post in November about USC needing a fall break. Soon after, she was asked by USG to become involved with their efforts to introduce one.
“As someone who just returned from a semester off due to mental health, I really think that USC needs to give us at least one three- or four-day weekend in the middle of the semester,” Nour said.
She stressed this isn’t an instance of students’ arbitrarily complaining, but rather a matter of mental health that should serve as a major source of concern.
“This isn’t just an, ‘Oh, suck it up and get over it,’ kind of thing,” Nour said. “It affects the mental health of students and could lead to one of us doing something stupid or attempting to take our life because of stress. If there’s anything USC can do to release this stress, it could be really helpful for everyone.”
Menard said that he is optimistic and hopes that, if his calendar proposal is accepted, it will be implemented by 2016. Whatever happens, he said, he is glad that USG has the opportunity to discuss a topic that students are passionate about with the calendar committee.
“This year, we’ve done a really great job at focusing on students from every community at USC,” USG Vice President Rini Sampath said. “This is a new project that I think affects all students on this campus, and I think that’s an exciting notion for us. This is just another open door for an improved undergraduate experience.”
If a student is considering taking their life because of mental stress, perhaps going to college at that stage in their life is not the right choice. What is a 3 day or 4 day weekend going to do that just talking it over with your professor and getting the homework assignments for those two days ahead of time, and then take the days off, sort of like sick days.  When you get in the real world, you will have sick days for this exact reason, as well as for being ill, but the works still has to be completed.
Next thing you know, the USG is going to push for a quarter system.

Students from colleges around Los Angeles were arrested last week for unlawful assembly in downtown Los Angeles during the protests following the grand jury decision to not indict police officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot Michael Brown on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Missouri.

One student, Kiren Singh, a sophomore majoring in business administration, participated in the protests on Nov. 24 and 25. She decided it was necessary to join the demonstrations that she saw developing on Figueroa Street outside of her apartment.
“I’m a person of color. I’m Indian, and I’m from the Bay Area,” Singh said. “I went to high school in Oakland, the Oakland-Berkeley area. I’ve always been very politically charged and for equality.”
Singh said that while she wanted to stand in solidarity with the protestors, she also wanted to understand how police officers felt about the situation. On Monday night, she sat in front of LAPD headquarters before other protestors arrived and talked to Sgt. James Baker for a few hours. Baker has been featured in online media in a video in which he takes the time to explain why the police officers are doing what they are doing.
“I think the issue at hand, at least for me, is that people who have pledged to protect us as their occupation, we fear them,” Singh said. “People think we live in a post-racial era, which is just not the case at all and it’s very much a prevalent issue in our society today. I think this is a huge movement for awareness and understanding just what our country is built on.”
Her interaction with the police the next night was entirely different. Singh was walking down Broadway Street trying to find other protestors when she noticed about 30 police cars lined up. Singh said a police officer approached her and her friend and said they would be arrested if they continued up the street. She was confused at this because Baker had told her the night before that people are only arrested for unlawful assembly when they become violent. According to Singh, when she expressed that her interest was to understand, as a college student, what it’s like being a law enforcement officer in our judicial system, the officer handcuffed her.
“For being on the sidewalk, I was unlawfully detained and searched. They took my wallet, went through my wallet, and because I didn’t have my student ID or driver’s license on me, they couldn’t ID me. They said that they would have to take me down to the station and get me fingerprinted,” Singh said. “I was sitting on the curb with metal cuffs around me. Especially after being manhandled, I didn’t feel it was necessary.”
Singh continued to ask the police officer why she was arrested, and as soon as she mentioned talking to Baker, the officer’s superior, she was released, Singh said. The police officer proceeded to tell her that he has two daughters around the same age as her, and he wanted to save Singh and her friend from getting into trouble.
Chelsea Kirk, a junior majoring in English (creative writing), was arrested on Tuesday night after partaking in what police said was an unlawful assembly. She was put onto a bus of 26 women, many of whom were undergraduate and graduate students at USC. Kirk was then transported to the Van Nuys police station to be booked for disturbing the peace.
Kirk joined the protests at 9 p.m. on Tuesday night at 1st and Main streets with five of her friends. They eventually joined the group of protestors who walked onto the 101 freeway. Kirk was at the front of the protest during this time, face-to-face with dozens of police officers.
She made her way off the freeway and ended up at Temple Street and Broadway at around 1:30 a.m., when the group of protestors was surrounded by police officers on every side of the intersection. She said there were so many police officers that it seemed there were five cops per protestor. Kirk said that she heard no warning that the protestors needed to disperse, but that a police officer spoke over a loud speaker, “You guys are subject to arrest for unlawful protesting.”
Three buses pulled up and one by one, all 183 of the protestors were arrested and transported to a police station for processing. The 26 women on the bus Kirk was on were put in cells at the Van Nuys jail and were told to post bails of $500 or else they would not be released until the next Monday. Twenty of the women posted bail, and the remaining six were released by last Wednesday.
Kirk said as she was being released, an officer said, “Make sure to give me a five-star review on Yelp.” Another police officer told her that she was lucky to be able to go home because they are on the job 24/7.
“That’s the whole reason [the protestors] are here — because the system favors the [cops] and not them,” Kirk said. “Their words were very dehumanizing. I felt marginalized in the situation. I knew I wasn’t a criminal, and I still don’t understand specifically what we did to be arrested. I don’t think they exactly knew either.”
Petulant, immature college children, protesting because they think it fashionable. Making trouble in LA does no good relative to a grand jury’s decision in Ferguson, MO. Want to do something useful for blacks? Volunteer to tutor at local schools in the USC area and maybe you can help a black child seek education, rather than drifting into the thug culture. And yes, as a USC undergrad years ago, I did that. I tutored children in reading and arithmetic at a local jr. high in a USC-run program. I didn’t save the world, and I may not have made a great difference, but it was more productive than protesting downtown like a silly ninny.

In their last regular season game of the season, the Women of Troy played a tough five-set match before they succumbed to their crosstown rival UCLA — just six days after USC’s football team also suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Bruins.
Three-peat · Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio was recently named to the Pac-12 First Team for the third straight year. The Guadalajara, Mexico, native will lead USC into to NCAA Tournament this weekend. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
With the regular season over, the Women of Troy finished with an even record of 15-15 and a conference record of 8-12. Though USC had one of the toughest schedules in the country, this team did not live up to expectations and had to fight to make the NCAA Tournament.
“We really expected to dominate and be in the hunt with Stanford and Washington,” said head coach Mick Haley. “We figured one of us would 19-1, the other 18-2 and last team would be 17-3, but that didn’t happen. The kids are still getting better and the setting is getting better with the new setters.”
This season has been filled with changes and injuries from the get-go. At the beginning of the season, freshman Lauryn Gillis started at outside hitter but sophomore Elise Ruddins stepped in and flourished at that position later. She became a great option when Bricio was in the back row.
After a slow start in conference, the Women of Troy changed their traditional 6-2 offense into a 6-2/5-1 hybrid. In this new offense, Haley removed senior setter Hayley Crone and used senior outside hitter Emily Young as a front row setter. This was a tough decision to make but as the season progressed the team started to gel and play better in this new system.
Most college programs have to go through their share of illness and injuries, but the Women of Troy were struck with the injury bug early. Before the season even started, they lost their star sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu for an extended period of time due to a back injury. They also lost defensive specialist Anne Marie Schmidt in the middle of conference play due to an undisclosed illness.
But just like the football team, the Women of Troy continued to pick themselves off the mat on several different occasions and kept working hard.
“People finally realized that they needed to have sense of urgency,” said senior middle blocker Hannah Schraer. “People started working harder in practice, and there were switches made, but everyone kept working hard.”
This USC team is extremely young, with 11 underclassmen, and the teammates continued to learn and improve as they played together. At the end of the season, the Women of Troy started to show what they are capable of accomplishing. Needing a win to become eligible to make the postseason, the Women of Troy traveled to Tucson to take on the Arizona Wildcats and won in a tough four-setter.
On Nov. 30, the Women of Troy’s postseason hopes were held in the balance by the NCAA selection committee. For the 24th consecutive time the Women of Troy made the tournament. This year, the NCAA selection committee chose an unprecedented 10 Pac-12 teams in the 64-team tournament. Luckily, USC was ranked 10th in the Pac-12.
The Women of Troy got placed into the bracket with the No. 2 overall seed Texas and No. 7 overall team, North Carolina.
“USC has a very favorable draw considering we were just hanging on the wire and I am very happy with the position that we have,” Young said. “We can definitely make it to regionals and then the Final Four.”
The Women of Troy’s first round matchup in Minneapolis will be against Coastal Carolina, a team that comes into the NCAA Tournament after beating No. 1 seed Radford in the Big South Championship. The Chanticleers have a record of 25-6 and are led by freshman outside hitter Leah Hardeman and setter Sam Skryd. In the 5-1 offense, Skryd has 1,073 assists on the season and 306 digs and her favorite hitter is Hardeman.
Hardeman has 464 kills on the season which averages out to 4.03 kills a set. She also has 2.82 digs per set and 48 total blocks on the season. Another dangerous hitter for the Chanticleers is middle blocker Katie Martin, who has 71 blocks and 223 kills. For the Women of Troy to be successful, they have to slow down both of these big hitters down.
If the Women of Troy get past the Chanticleers, they will have to face the winner of the North Carolina and Hampton contest in the second round, which will be no easy test. Though the regular season did not go as expected, a deep run in the NCAA tournament can change everyone’s mind.

Following an impressive road victory over the New Mexico Lobos, the USC men’s basketball team looks to continue its winning ways as it hosts the Loyola Marymount Lions on Wednesday night.
Double-double · Redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark posted 12 points and 11 rebounds in USC’s win over New Mexico last weekend. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (4-3) won their first true road win of the season on Sunday when they beat the Lobos, 66-54. This was their first game on an opponent’s court after playing three games at home and an additional three at a neutral site.
Redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark led the team to the win at The Pit with 12 points and 11 rebounds while sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic added 10 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for the Trojans.
“I thought Darion Clark really set the tone with 12 points, 11 rebounds,” USC head coach Andy Enfield after the game. “Nikola [Jovanovic] got into it and was rebounding at a high level.”
Much of the victory could be attributed to the fact that USC held New Mexico’s senior guard Hugh Greenwood to a scoreless performance. Greenwood came into the matchup averaging 13 points per game, but the Trojans limited him to 0-for-11 shooting, including a dismal 0-for-9 from beyond the arc. New Mexico was led by forward Devon Williams, who had a career-high 15 points and a career-high 10 rebounds.
Freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin, who is leading the team in scoring this season,  scored only eight points in the win, but he showed off his passing ability with seven assists, which led the team. And while redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt was scoreless in the game, he did defend Greenwood for the majority of the contest, forcing him to take tough shots and go scoreless as well.
“Greenwood is such an excellent offensive player. We knew it would be tough but we never imagined we would hold him scoreless,” Enfield said. “That’s just a testament to how well we played defensively.”
The Trojans will look to improve their shooting percentage against LMU: they shot only 38.3 percent from the floor against New Mexico including only 23.5 percent from deep. Though the Trojans did not have a good shooting performance, their defense was able to hold New Mexico to 32.7 percent from the field and only 12.5 percent from three. They will also try to keep their turnovers down as they did on Sunday, only committing nine; turnovers were a problem for this young team earlier in the season.
The Lions will enter the game with a 3-3 record, having recently lost to UC Irvine on Saturday. LMU is led by guard Evan Payne, who has scored 20 points in five of the Lions’ six games, including 23 against Irvine.
LMU has 11 newcomers on its roster and will rely on its three seniors to lead an inexperienced group. Forward Godwin Okonji and guard Ayodeji Egbeyemi are playing in their fifth seasons after having to sit out last year due to injuries. The third senior on the team, guard Chase Flint, will also look to use his experience to lead a group that includes only three players who played significant minutes for the Lions last season: Flint, Payne and forward Marin Mornar.
The Trojans will try to improve to 5-3 on the year as they look to get their fourth win in a row. The game will tip off at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center. USC is 2-1 at home and LMU is 0-1 on the road, only having lost to Arizona State.

There was something different about the way the USC football team looked Saturday. The Trojans’ win last week was reminiscent of a very similar victory six weeks earlier, but with one key difference.
On Oct. 18, the Trojans dominated a weak Colorado team in an afternoon game at the Coliseum, winning by a final score of 56-28. Saturday, the Trojans dominated a weak Notre Dame team in an afternoon game at the Coliseum, winning by a final score of 49-14. Visually, the latter was a much more beautiful performance to watch, but that had nothing to do with the final point difference or the historical legitimacy of the opponent.
The Trojans wore their original helmets.
The distinction is subtle. In fact, it wasn’t until this Monday when I was looking through photos of the game that I noticed the change. But the classic cardinal helmets that have been virtually unchanged for generations of Trojan football were back on the heads of the USC football players after a brief hibernation in the locker room. I hope that remains the case as long as I’m a student of this fine academic institution.
Before the Colorado game, the Trojans adjusted their usual uniform and unveiled new chrome helmets. The team stuck with the new style against Utah, Cal and UCLA. The traditional cardinal home jersey, white away jersey and gold pants were still the same, but the outfit was coronated by a brighter, shinier headpiece.
It looked atrocious.
Now I’m not a huge fashion guy. I would honestly say that 67 percent of the shirts in my closet are St. Louis Cardinals T-shirts and I recently noticed myself walking around campus wearing athletic shorts, loafers and business socks.
But I can distinguish a classy throwback from a regrettable redesign. I graduated from kindergarten, so I have a basic understanding of colors.
And the colors just didn’t match with the chrome helmets.
The helmet looked almost scarlet in the glare of the sunlight, much lighter than the cardinal jersey. It didn’t look as bad with the road white jersey on, when the contrast was a bit more natural. But at home, the helmet stuck out like Harry and Lloyd at the cocktail party in “Dumb & Dumber.” My mom, who knows a lot about Trojan tradition as a USC alumna, put it best while watching the Cal game during Trojan Family Weekend:
“It looks like a Christmas ornament.”
When the Fighting Irish came to town, USC ditched the futuristic failure for the old-school staple. It was a fitting tribute to the history of the rivalry, as Notre Dame is the only team on the schedule that really does rival  the Trojans’ tradition of excellence in football.
Forgive me for going on a 450-word rant without actually analyzing any football. It’s been a rough week regarding term paper due dates, so I’ve used up just about all of my remaining critical thinking energy for the semester.
But I think the helmet flip-flop is actually very indicative of the general state of USC football as well as where this season stands in the big picture.
USC football is something really, really awesome. The fact that we get to walk past six Heisman trophies — insert NCAA sanctions joke — anytime we attend class by way of Heritage Hall or sit in the same stadium that was home to 11 national championship teams — insert same NCAA sanctions joke — on Saturdays is something that any self-described sports fan here should never forget. As fellow Daily Trojan columnist Jake Davidson wrote after the Trojans’ domination of Washington State, we are so lucky to be a part of a fan base with more happy times than, say, Washington State’s.
But the current installment of USC football is not exactly on the same level that many Trojan fans expect. I came here to see USC football teams play in Rose Bowls and BCS championship bowls, not Sun Bowls or Holiday Bowls or other you can’t actually put that in a bowl Bowls.
The higher expectations are the product of our generation. Today, attention spans disappear after about three seconds, kind of like Snapchats. Fans don’t have the patience for anything other than dominance every single year. If your team isn’t undefeated, it must be the coach’s fault.
Athletic directors often cave to this pressure from fans and fire head coaches way sooner than they should be. This isn’t because of some cognitive error from ADs about the time it takes to build a program. It’s because boosters won’t put their names on new stadiums or student athlete centers if they aren’t happy. That financial support of boosters is crucial in the era of multi-million dollar commercialization.
I’m beyond excited for the inaugural playoff that will replace the aforementioned BCS format. College football has never been more exciting  given the playoff and the level of national parity. But TV deals and conference realignments show that more teams are pledging the resources to be a top-level team, and fans want to win now.
The existential crisis for USC going forward is whether to innovate or embrace tradition.
On one hand, we see teams like Alabama who are steeped in history and have dominated recent years by playing good ol’ fashioned, hard-nosed football. On the other hand, we see teams like Oregon that had no tradition before this century but invented a new identity with fancy jerseys — think we’d ever pull that helmet stunt if the Ducks hadn’t started that trend? — and a revolutionized spread offense. (Boy, do I hope those two teams play for the national championship…)
So what should USC do moving forward? Should it unveil a third jersey where everything is chrome and shiny? If the up-tempo offense seems to work so well, should the offense adopt an all-out spread attack? Can USC compete for a national championship with a Pete Carroll disciple as head coach?
All of those questions are worth their own column, but I’ll conclude my regular season assessment with this: Carroll’s first year record at USC? 6-6. Ed Orgeron’s first year record as head coach of Ole Miss? 3-8. After being considered for the USC job, James Franklin and Chris Petersen’s respective first-year records at Penn State and Washington? Just 6-6 and 8-5.
All of those records are worse than Steve Sarkisian’s 8-4 first regular season record at USC.
I believe in Sarkisian going forward. I don’t doubt his play-calling that much, I don’t doubt his choice in defensive coordinator, and I definitely don’t doubt his ability to inspire players given his recruiting record. If Trojan fans can remain patient and keep supporting Sarkisian, this team will be competing in College Football Playoff games sooner than you think.
I have no idea who the Trojans will play, but I also have a lot of confidence that the Trojans will have a dominating bowl win reminiscent of last year to cap off the season.
But please, ditch the chrome helmets for the bowl game.

i didnt realize they went original for the nd game.  i was watching on tv thinking that, huh, the helmets look pretty good with the uniforms this week. i was a little distressed that they may have changed the uniforms to match the helmets better!  lol!
I could not agree with you more on the helmet issue.  The shiny ones have to go where they came from, and keep them there.

Five members of USC’s football team earned first-team Pac-12 football honors on Tuesday, the conference announced. Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor and junior center Max Tuerk headlined the list on offense. On defense, junior defensive end Leonard Williams and sophomore defensive back Su’a Cravens represented the Trojans.
First and foremost · Junior Nelson Agholor was one of two wide receivers to earn first team all-conference honors. Agholor boasts 1,233 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns this season along with two punt return scores. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Freshman corner-wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson was named the Defensive Freshman of the Year and freshman wide receiver-safety JuJu Smith earned second-team specialist honors.
Agholor is second in the conference in receiving yards (1,223) and third in receiving touchdowns (11). The Tampa, Florida, product had an off-game at UCLA, with just three catches for 24 yards, but in the other five most recent games, he’s averaged 158.8 yards per game. These impressive performances earned him a spot on the shortlist for the Biletnikoff Award, which former Trojan Marqise Lee won in 2012.
Allen posted six consecutive 100-plus-yard rushing games in the middle of the season, the longest such streak since Heisman winner Marcus Allen had 11 in 1981. The Tallahassee, Florida, native, has racked up 1,337 rushing yards this season along with nine touchdowns. He’s also hauled in 442 receiving yards and a touchdown through the air. His 1,779 all-purpose yards are good for 14th in the nation.
On the other side of the ball, Cravens had a breakout season for the Trojans. He transitioned from safety to linebacker and recorded 62 total tackles, including a team-high 16 tackles for loss. Cravens proved himself an explosive playmaker by hauling in two interceptions and racking up five sacks.
Williams, who was also a 2013 first-teamer, hauled in an unlikely interception in the Trojans’ season opener on his way to a 71-tackle season. He’s managed 8.5 tackles for loss and six sacks, while forcing three fumbles in what was likely his final season at USC, as he’s been hailed as a Top-5 pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.
Jackson became the third Trojan in four years to be named defensive freshman of the year. The versatile playmaker has 42 total tackles this season. Jackson also has nine passes defensed this season and one forced fumble and recovery, and has held opposing quarterbacks to a 118.5 passing efficiency rating — the second-best mark by a defensive back in the conference. Though he couldn’t duplicate Myles Jack’s accomplishment of earning both offensive and defensive freshman honors, Jackson was impressive on offense as well, hauling in two touchdowns this season, in addition to his 100-yard kickoff return touchdown at Utah.
Jackson also made the Pac-12 honorable mention list on defense along with senior linebackers Hayes Pullard and J.R. Tavai. Honorable mentions on offense included redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, freshman offensive linemen Toa Lobendahn and Viane Talamaivao and senior tight end Randall Telfer.
Despite leading the conference in completion percentage (70.7), Kessler lost out to Oregon’s Marcus Mariota and UCLA’s Brett Hundley, who were named to the first and second team, respectively.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Sorry, I couldn’t help myself, Andy Williams’ song just gets me in the holiday spirit. It’s finally winter recess, where we all get to leave campus and go home to spend some much-needed quality time with the ones we love, and whether you’re with family or friends, it is sure to be a great time. There will be eggnog, cookies, ice skating, marshmallows and of course, Christmas movies. But one thing will be missing once you travel back home: your significant other.
There won’t be holding hands while ice skating or cuddling up with cups of hot cocoa, and that can put a real damper on your holiday spirit. Your family waits weeks to see you, and there is nothing that hurts more than them feeling like you aren’t just as excited to see them. So no matter how much you miss your love, you cannot sit around and act sullen.
This is a time to be grateful for the opportunities you have been given in life, and it is unnecessary to focus on the stress distance will put on your relationship. It is easy to think everything has to go smoothly during the holidays — from cooking holiday meals to the gifts you buy for your loved ones and seeing old friends you wish to impress — but nothing is perfect.
A month is a long time to be separated from someone you love, but there are ways to combat some of the worries. Before you leave, have a game plan of how you both intend to keep in touch with one another.
I find that the best way to keep up is Skype or ooVoo. If that is too much for you, even just a phone call before bed works well. When my boyfriend and I first started dating, distance was a huge factor in our relationship. He lives on the West Coast while I’m all the way across the country on the East Coast. We both knew that we would have to put in extra effort to talk to each other. Our families are extremely keen on family time, and that left little time for our relationship. So we made a plan. We Skyped at least once a week, and it did not matter what day as long as we had at least 20 minutes to catch up. Additionally, he would call me every night just before I went to bed. Sometimes that phone call was only two minutes, but we got to hear each other’s voices, which was nice.
One of the hardest parts of being away from your significant other is that you do not know who your significant other is hanging out with. No matter how much you trust each other, the thought of them cheating on you over the holidays will creep into your mind. One of the most exciting parts of going home for the holidays is seeing high school friends. Unfortunately, this might include high school flings. We all know people who cannot wait to go home specifically to see an ex and have one more quick rendezvous with them. Be open with one another and talk about the friends you are going to see. You do not have to specify if you have been romantic with the person unless your significant other asks you directly, but the worst thing you can do is lie. Even if you have no intentions of cheating, it makes you seem like you are hiding something when you lie or omit information.
In today’s day and age, technology plays a major role in relationships and can create riffs between couples. One thing to remember is not to use social media against each other. Every memory we have is usually plastered all over Facebook and a lot of the time pictures can be misleading. As much as we want to take pictures kissing our best guy friends on the cheek or taking pictures with our seven best guys friends, it’s good to be considerate of our significant other. Not being able to see each other only gets harder when you see pictures of your significant other having a great time without you.
Don’t get me wrong — you can hang out with your guy and girl friends, party and have a good time, but that does not mean you need everyone else to see it by Instagramming and Facebooking every second. Trust me, your significant other will thank you later when you are finally reunited and made it through Christmas break with no problems.
Enjoy this time with your family and understand that even though it feels like a month is forever, you and your significant other will be reunited shortly.

Remote Area Medical, a documentary produced and directed by Jeff Reichert and Farihah Zaman, recognizes that the issue of health care has become more of a debate about red and blue partisanship and less of a debate about people. The documentary takes a step back from the politics of health care and, instead, through individual interviews and case studies, invites its audience into the personal lives of communities lacking quality health care.
Helping hand · Remote Area Medical focuses on an organization of the same name that specializes in providing medical care to those in isolated areas. The film shows them doing this at a NASCAR track in rural Tennessee. – Photo courtesy of Candescent Films
The documentary centers on Remote Area Medical, a nonprofit that provides free services such as general health care and dental and vision work to communities in isolated areas. Though these services were once focused on inaccessible areas of the Amazon rain forest, many of them have been recently concentrated on remote areas of the United States, where communities are geographically or financially separated from accessible health care. The documentary particularly focuses on the events of a three-day clinic held by Remote Area Medical in the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee.
The general narrative of Remote Area Medical explains the problem of inaccessibility to health care even in the United States. The documentary captures the effort put into bringing medical care to remote areas: large trucks roll into the speedway with equipment, and staff haul the trucks’ content into the speedway for set-up. The documentary also captures the struggles of the crowds camping out in a parking lot at the speedway at 3:30 a.m., hoping to get a ticket for the program. Many of the prospective patients had traveled from distant states to receive medical care, and some patients were skipping shifts at work.
Though the policy issues linked to health care swim beneath the surface of the documentary’s narrative, Remote Area Medical lets the footage speak for itself, refusing to take a clear political stance. In a Q&A session at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, Zaman stated that the point of the documentary was not to give a “thesis statement by pushing people to talk about politics.” Instead, she stated, the best way to mirror the reality of the events in Remote Area Medical was to “let situations speak for themselves.”
The heavy use of personal interviews and case studies allows Remote Area Medical to accomplish that goal. The narrative of the documentary cuts periodically from short personal interviews to longer coverages of a few key patients — sometimes, the documentary even follows the patients back to their homes for extended interviews. These recorded testimonies and experiences reveal both the needs of the patients and the deficiencies of the RAM clinic, without causing the documentary to choose a definite political side. Instead of making overt points about the Affordable Care Act or welfare reform, the documentary allows stories to make an impact on their own: the stories of interviewed patients who cannot find employment that promises more than minimum wages, and thus cannot visit the emergency room even in urgent cases, and who don’t even have the gas money to see a doctor. One of the RAM doctors mentions patients who can’t drive home from work because of their poor eyesight and a patient who had never known what a leaf looked like before receiving glasses.
The documentary, however, does not fully endorse the approach of free health care programs, as it also, through patients’ stories, makes subtle points about the drawbacks of using private charities as a solution for health care systems. The documentary includes interviews with patients who aren’t able to get full or immediate medical care from the RAM clinic. Some patients aren’t able to get a ticket to the clinic during the one day when they are able to travel to the clinic. Many are told to wait in the speedway parking lot until the next round of tickets are available at 3:30 a.m. the next day. One patient points out that even coming to the clinic is a cognitive struggle, since asking for help from a free program requires the surrender of personal pride.
Remote Area Medical forces the viewer to consider the personal faces behind political consequences, instead of insisting on a generalized partisan preference. By being shown human struggles and testimonies instead of a manifesto, as well as being provided with both sides of the story at the RAM clinic, the film’s viewers are free to come to their own conclusions about the stories with which they are presented.
The personal angle of Remote Area Medical allows the tone of the documentary to not only remain politically neutral, but also allows the narrative to encompass issues that are more complex and intimate than a debate about voting blue or red. During the SCA Q&A session, Reichert stated, “When [the patients] realized we were interested in more than their health problems, they really opened up.”
Zaman added, “They seemed legitimately shocked that people wanted to hear their stories.”
These personal stories reveal that some health care issues aren’t merely biological problems. One of these extended interviews in the documentary, for example, follows the story of a patient who is burdened by a gum disease. The patient states that, because of her changed appearance, the disease has eroded her self confidence, thus diminishing her once-extroverted personality. Another interviewed patient states that she is unable to go to her daughter’s graduation and had been previously diagnosed with depression because of the appearance of a cyst in her eye. Though Remote Area Medical was initially designed to focus on the mechanics of the RAM clinic, its concentration on the stories of the patients allows the viewers to see a more profoundly personal and psychological side of the health care debate.
Because of this intimate — and heartbreaking — side of health care that is revealed through such a personal approach, Remote Area Medical is meant to stir emotions in spite of its political neutrality. The audience is subtly directed to connect with the poignant words of the RAM patients. As Reichert stated during the SCA Q&A, “Hopefully, you’ve been outraged.”
Remote Area Medical opens on Dec. 5, at Music Hall 3 in Beverly Hills.

There’s a long list of the celebrities she’s photographed and the magazines she’s worked for. In fact, this whole article could be centered entirely on name dropping. But to focus on her subjects would be a great offense to the talent and passion of photographer Deborah Feingold.
Feingold has been in love with photography since she was 12 years old. What began as a hobby evolved into a decades long career. Despite setting out to be an actress and then earning a teaching degree, Feingold just couldn’t shake her love of photography. This Thursday, Dec. 4, Feingold will be speaking at the Annenberg Space for Photography at 6:30 p.m.
“[Photography] was nothing that I regarded in any way other than a hobby that was just great fun,” she said. “You know in your generation, I think the word hobby has been replaced with ‘how can I make money out of this’ but back then a hobby was something you did for the sheer joy of it.”
After graduating from Emerson College, Feingold taught photography in a juvenile detention center as sharing her passion with others solidified her love for the camera. But she saw more than just the lens of a camera, she learned to see from new perspectives. She describes the experience as stepping outside her own private world and into a larger one where things didn’t seem so fair and right.
Her involvement with new worlds didn’t end there. Feingold fell in love with a musician, and she was welcomed into a whole other world. Jazz embodied many of the aspects that Feingold loved about theater. That, coupled with the carefree attitudes of the musicians she met, were intoxicating for her. For Feingold, it was always her love of photography that kept her going. By day, she was a substitute teacher, but at night, she grabbed her camera bag and shot photos of musicians and bands. She got a few gigs taking photos for the local colleges, but it wasn’t until a friend of a friend offered her an assignment shooting Chet Baker that she launched what would become a remarkable career.
“I actually go into an altered space when I shoot,” Feingold said. “And nothing in my life, and I love my daughter, has matched that. It is the only time, when I’m shooting, where I can fall into a state where I’m so in the present, and that is such a gift, and we all strive with our yoga and meditation, but when I have that camera in my hand and I get in a groove, there’s nothing that matches that.”
The most interesting thing about Feingold isn’t her career, but rather her outlook and passion. Talking to Feingold is like sitting down with a carefree aunt you always secretly wished was your mom. The one who went off and traveled the world, followed her dreams but still somehow managed to listen when you needed boy advice. It’s this adventurous but attentive attitude that characterizes her work. For Feingold, she never stopped being that 12-year-old girl whose favorite thing to do was just pick up a camera and shoot.
“And not to sound too altruistic  [but] I’ve always been filled with gratitude,” she said. ”I get a deep amount of satisfaction. A day never went by where I wasn’t grateful for what I did. I knew it could always end, but how lucky have I been? I never worked in an office. This is what I’ve known and I think that kind of awareness made me a better photographer, I didn’t take anything for granted.”
Her talk won’t just include stories from more than 30 years of working with actors, musicians, politicians and comedians. It will be an eye-opening chance to listen to a woman talk with such vigor and vibrancy that no matter your hobby, you can’t help but to be inspired. Her humble attitude is a characteristic that resonates with everyone.
Though she is mostly excited, Feingold did confess to being a little anxious about the talk. Feingold admitted that since her work relies so much on interaction, it’s always alien to her to stand in front of a crowd and just speak.
“I like to think I had my hardest group the very first time I spoke — the average age was 70 — the first thing I say is, ‘I haven’t spoken to this many people since my bat mitzvah,’ and nobody laughed, and I had to go on for another hour,” she said.
But that attitude is what makes her stand out. Her ability to jump in and take the reins is what took her from Massachusetts to New York, working for local colleges to Musician and Rolling Stone magazines, from shooting local musicians to taking the credit for book covers and portraits of everyone from Mick Jagger to President Barack Obama.

Last Friday, Australian indie folk singer/songwriter Vance Joy played for a sold-out crowd of 1,300 at the Fonda Theatre. The next time he plays in Los Angeles, he’ll be crooning for an audience 14 times that.

Three weeks ago, serial heartbreaker Taylor Swift dropped her self-aware video for “Blank Space” and speculation regarding her past and future paramours rekindled. But while her trysts remain a source of gossip fun, one name she’s written in a completely different blank space is the opening artists for her highly anticipated 1989 tour. The name is Vance Joy.
In just two years, Vance Joy (real name James Keogh) has gone from playing a small pub of 200 in Melbourne to creating a hit single that catapulted him into international spotlight and landed him a spot on Billboard’s Hot 100.
Next May, he’ll have additional attention when he joins Swift on her North American tour, where he’ll follow in the footsteps of musicians that have seen a huge boost in popularity since performing with the pop star, including Ed Sheeran and Ellie Goulding.
Not to mention that the Melbourne gig which was a big deal at the time will be eclipsed by the stages Keogh will take on Swift’s tour, where smaller venues can pack 17,000 fans and the larger arenas have capacities three times that.
“When I started, it would’ve sounded ridiculous to think I would support her. It was outside the realm of possibility,” Keogh said. “It starts off small, and you do things slightly bigger and then slightly bigger until it’s not totally ridiculous. The scales have changed.”
A lot more has changed since Keogh became Vance Joy (a stage name borrowed from a grandfather figure and storyteller found in Peter Carey’s novel Bliss). Though he started penning what he called “really average songs” at 18, Keogh first obtained a law degree and even considered playing football professionally before he became a singer.
“By the end of my law degree, I had a couple of songs and I had the feeling like I had to go down that path and see where it would take me,” Keogh said.
At first it was that pub in October 2012, where his entire year had been building toward his first proper show and where, for the first time, a couple hundred had gathered to sing along to the single that would put him on the map: “Riptide.”
“It’s such a weird song, and the lyrics are all over the place, but they still make sense in a way even though they’re quite stream-of-consciousness,” Keogh said.
In the single, Keogh sings of his fear of dentists and starting conversations and includes a movie recommendation and a comparison of his girl to Michelle Pfeiffer (“hopefully she’s tickled by it,” he said). But the joy and romp of the song is tempered by the end of the chorus: “I love you when you’re singing that song / and I got a lump in my throat / ’cause you’re gonna sing the words wrong.”
The idea of the caveat in love, the nuance in the relationship, the devil in the details, is a common thread in Vance Joy’s songs and plays a particularly sizable role on his debut album, Dream Your Life Away, which dropped this past September.
“I think those moments where you go from the general to the specific are really powerful,” he said. “When there’s a specific detail, it creates an atmosphere and a context. If I’m writing using a specific image to create an atmosphere or create an impression, I think it can be really effective.”
For example, he says, if it’s a hot day and it’s a summer, he might include a narrative detail like observing someone touching their neck because of the heat.
“That can be a great way of making it intimate and close and personal,” Keogh said. “I use that in songs.”
Vance Joy’s music is characterized by its simplicity. Keogh relies primarily on guitar and ukulele with occasional assistance from his band. His success lies in his lyrics and the raw vulnerability with which he sings them.
“I don’t know exactly why it’s worked,” Keogh said. “I think when it comes to writing songs, I have my way and my own approach to songwriting and I try to stay true to those standards. If it works for me, I find that its meaning will hit a spot for someone else.”
Vance Joy will round out his American tour with a series of holiday festivals before returning to his native Australia. He returns to Los Angeles next August when he’ll play a four-day stint at the Staples Center under Swift’s bill.

University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan spoke to students on Monday to address the recent controversy surrounding the school after a Rolling Stone article detailing allegations of sexual assault at the university’s fraternities — and complicity on the part of the school administration — was published on Nov. 19. “We have a problem, and we are going to get after it,” Sullivan told students.
Yes, UVA, the gang rape of a freshman student by seven fraternity brothers — including with a beer bottle — that resulted in none of the perpetrators being punished is definitely a “problem.”
But there’s another larger “problem” here — that this didn’t become an issue until an article detailing a horrific incident went viral.
Why wasn’t this a “problem” when the Department of Education released a list of 55 colleges and universities with open Title IX sexual violence investigations — a list USC was also on — on May 1, or when dozens of students approached the head of UVA’s Sexual Misconduct Board, Dean Nicole Eramo, about being raped?
Colleges and universities’ lack of response to the nationwide issue of sexual assault has been stunning. The Department of Education is currently investigating an astonishing 90 institutions of higher education, and rape and other forms of sexual violence are undoubtedly an issue at more schools than just these. In fact, the author of the Rolling Stone article, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, chose not to focus on UVA as a specific incident, but rather as a case study of rape culture at schools all over America.
“I was looking to focus on a school that was elite, a respected school, but also one where the culture felt representative of what’s going on on campuses across the country,” Erdely told NBC29. “UVA though seemed like a place where everybody could kind of relate to it in some way.”
But no one cares about drawn-out investigations or abstract accusations of vague crimes. People care about people. No one is going to demand change until there’s a specific, unbelievably gruesome tale to rally behind.
That’s why campus groups advocating for change and awareness are often composed of victims or friends and family. In the Rolling Stone article, a female student identified as “Jackie” was introduced to the group One Less, described as “a student-run sexual-assault education organization that doubles as a support group.” The only way One Less could also function as a support group is if the members had all undergone traumatic experiences.
“Jackie” provided the needed story for UVA. But at other colleges and universities across the nation, there has been no widely read story of a respectable publication, allowing school administrations to continue in their complicity with cultures of sexual assault on campus.
Some doubt the credibility of the story, however. Robby Soave, a writer for libertarian magazine Reason, labeled Erdely’s story as simply “not credible,”  as “journalists who contemplate such matters” now believe. He cited editor-in-chief of Worth magazine Richard Bradley, who wrote on his blog, “I don’t believe that it happened — certainly not in the way that it is recounted.” Both Soave and Bradley completely disregard the fact that this past weekend, Erdely gave the Washington Post an extensive interview detailing the weeks she spent fact-checking the story. Regardless of what skeptics have to say, their doubts shouldn’t detract from the indisputable fact that sexual assault is a pressing issue at UVA and other campuses nationwide.
Since the article was published, UVA has taken several actions. Fraternities were banned for the rest of the semester, the governing board passed a resolution expressing its commitment to a zero tolerance policy on sexual assault and the article’s allegations are being addressed. UVA’s administration has been forced to act because of the glaring spotlight the story has placed on them. But that spotlight is only on them. Erdely’s attempt to bring light to the national issue of sexual assault has failed.
At the end of the day, it’s not the responsibility of students and the general public to make sure these issues are addressed. Momentary outrage over one story is bound to fall off the radar as soon as the next big thing comes around. But it is the responsibility of the university to protect its students and to ensure a culture of security for all — no matter their gender or level of intoxication.
Campuses must step up to address the issue before the next “Jackie” comes along and their efforts are found, again, to be too little, too late.

Rolling Stone retracted the story due to “misplaced trust” in the alleged rape victim. I look forward to reading your follow up about false accusations fueling irrational rape hysteria on college campuses. 
Colleges need to embark on intensive programs discouraging the primitive, mindless, wild college culture that glorifies rapes and binge-drinking. Yes, college students are free of mom and dad and will let loose. But the colleges need to do more to curb the vile wild behaviors that brutalize women, ruin students’ lives and kill some of them from auto crashes or alcohol poisoning.
Colleges can only do so much to stop the terrible behavior shown by college students. At some point we need to look at our culture as a whole and it’s up to each individual to make good choices. Why do so many students find it acceptable to engage in these behaviors and why are none of their peers putting a stop to it?

In the digital age, formal methods of communication are disappearing one after another — after all, emailing and texting have already begun replacing letters and phone calls. Though advances in technology do bring a host of benefits, they also enable other developments that are less admirable — in particular, the online social media apology.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
 
Public confessions of remorse have been reduced to half-hearted efforts to patch up reputations after people spew offensive comments. Just this past Thanksgiving, Republican staffer Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher of  Tennessee, openly criticized Sasha and Malia Obama on her Facebook page for their dress and demeanor at the annual White House turkey pardoning ceremony. Lauten crossed ethical lines.
“Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re part of the First Family, try showing a little class,” Lauten wrote. “Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don’t make faces during televised, public events.”
Adding to the offensive comments, Lauten went as far as to turn the two girls into political targets when she added, “Then again, your mother and father don’t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter, so I’m guessing you’re coming up a little short in the ‘good role model’ department.” In one blow, Lauten discredited both the Obama girls and the president in a demeaning manner. Posting it on Facebook for the world to see turned a tactless snark into full-blown malice.
What’s more ridiculous, however, is Lauten’s attempt at an apology after receiving backlash for her rude statement. According to USA Today, Lauten resigned on Monday following her harsh comments. Her decision doesn’t change the fact that the apology she put online before her resignation announcement was insincere. In yet another Facebook post, she admitted that she had “judged the two young ladies in a way that [she] would never have wanted to be judged [her]self as a teenager,” and that she would like to “apologize to all of those who [she has] hurt and offended with [her] words.” Her post might seem heartfelt, but the lack of personal apology is evident. Beyond the fact that it was done through social media — a platform that lacks an element of personal touch and assumption of responsibility on Lauten’s part — her confession doesn’t even address the two girls directly, whom her comments had offended, ramping the insincerity up a notch. As Elisa Doucette pointed out in Forbes, one simple acknowledgment would have made all the difference in the world: “Instead of apologizing for a post about Malia and Sasha Obama, Lauten needs to treat them like they are human beings deserving of her compassion and respect, rather than puppets to dance around in political battles.” If Lauten had addressed the two girls and personally apologized to them, then the rest of social media, which is still railing on Lauten for her comments, might back off.
In fact, an apology sans social media — perhaps face-to-face — would have been most appropriate. Heide Cohen, writer for the Actionable Marketing Guide, believes that social media apologies aren’t sincere enough: “While Twitter and other social media platforms can distribute your words of regret quickly, widely and painlessly, generally it’s best if the person who misspoke apologizes directly to the wronged party as soon as possible in as personal a way as possible.” By apologizing over social media, it was clear that Lauten’s apology was driven more by fear of backlash from the community than by regret over what she actually said about the sisters.
Though many people have social media blunders, the necessity for personal apologies is paramount. Without them, we will forget the appropriate way to apologize. Without genuine apologies to those wronged over social media, there can be no sincerity.
Chelsea Hernandez is a senior majoring in English (creative writing). Her column, “Foot in Mouth,” ran Wednesdays.
You apologize to the people you harmed! Not your friends on Facebook.  But apologizing to the two girls would mean acknowledging that the Obama family are human beings and we can’t have that can we?  
Harold Franklin, 1981
Chelsea,
It boils down to this: people need to think before they tweet, email, or text about other people.  If your in a position that will garner more attention then you really need to be careful.  Nothing is safe from being scrutinized online and people on both sides of the political aisle as well as people in general will keep learning this harsh reality if they keep doing these kind of rants online.  As for a personal apology, neither individual involved probably wants to see the other so that will never happen.
