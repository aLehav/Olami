Most people don’t seek to deeply analyze the music they listen to and many more don’t watch PBS, but when a former Dateline NBC producer teams up with some culture-hungry broadcast reporters, the result might force us to do both.
Sound Tracks — an hour-long television newsmagazine which aired its pilot episode on the nonprofit network last night—lives up to its “music without borders” tagline by travelling the world and investigating some of the most interesting musical situations out there.
In its inaugural showing, a political themed show took the Sound Tracks’ crews to Russia (where they discovered the almost comical creation of Putin’s Euro-trance propaganda song), Nigeria (where they hung out with the son of afrobeat creator and political activist Fela Kuti) and Kazakhstan (where they filmed the nation’s philharmonic performing a piece written by the same man who had written the fake national anthem for Borat).
Through these travels, Sound Tracks brings you stories otherwise left untold and gives new perspectives to these culturally significant occurances. Nobody on television (or in documentaries, for that matter) has gone in depth like this before.
With the pilot episode of Sound Tracks airing last night on the nonprofit network, PBS is also hoping to attract a younger, more hip audience. Since its geriatric viewership is about to turn, the show is the first in a string of youthful programming coming to the station. And if the stories mentioned above don’t lure in the college crowd, maybe the Vampire Weekend theme song will.
The entire first episode of Sound Tracks can be streamed on their homepage: pbs.org/soundtracks
(Tell them how much you like it so PBS will give them money to make more episodes!)

Long-time School of Cinematic Arts professor Mel Sloan, whose time at USC spanned more than 50 years, passed away earlier this month. He was 86.
Remembered · Mel Sloan, School of Cinematic Arts professor emeritus, passed away this month. - Photo courtesy of the School of Cinematic Arts 
Though Sloan devoted much of his life to film, his love of the craft did not begin until he was a teenager. As a child, movies were among Sloan’s least favorite forms of entertainment.
According to Sloan’s sister Irene Golden, when Sloan was young he watched the movie Frankenstein and, thereafter, became scared and skeptical of films for a long time.
“If he ever did anything wrong, my mother would say, ‘I’ll take you to the movies,’” Golden said.
But eventually Sloan began to develop an interest in photography and later decided he was going to move to California to study film.
“He wanted to go to ’SC,” Golden said.
Sloan graduated from USC and joined the faculty in 1946. He taught until his retirement in 1997.
Sloan pioneered the course cinematic communication (CTPR 290), an integral part of the film production curriculum. One of the first courses cinema students take, the class emphasizes hands-on participation in all parts of the production process.
In his time at USC, Sloan worked with students including George Lucas, Irvin Kershner and Robert Zemeckis, all of whom later credited Sloan with helping them become successful in the industry.
Sloan’s long-time friend and colleague Woody Omens, who was a student of Sloan’s, said it wasn’t the content of Sloan’s classes that affected his students but his method.
“It wasn’t about technique, it wasn’t really about film,” Owens said. “It was about what’s in your soul; can you get at it [through film] and can you get it to affect somebody else?”
Sloan’s wife, Rita, said her husband always pushed his students and helped foster a love of film, often screening films for his students at his house.
“He always said to his students, ‘If your work is something you like, then you get paid twice,’” Rita said.
Omens said Sloan encouraged his students to develop not just a love of film but also a love of life.
“He made his life interesting,” Omens said. “And he thought that there was no reason students coming to him couldn’t be awakened to making their lives more interesting too.”
When he wasn’t teaching, Sloan worked on feature films such as Stakeout on Dope Street with Irvin Kershner, Haskell Wexler and Gene Petersen, all of whom developed close bonds with the cinema professor. But, Rita said, Sloan did not feel the same passion for Hollywood as he did for the art of filmmaking.
“He wanted to be his own boss,” she said. “He wanted to deal with things he felt were more important.”
Fellow emeritus professor Ken Miura, who described Sloan as more of a friend than colleague, estimated that he taught more than 2,500 students during his time at USC.
Rita said Sloan will be remembered “not just because of the legacy he left at USC but because of the person he was.”
Sloan is survived by Rita, his wife of 60 years; their three children, Jeff, Len and Barry; three grandchildren; and his sister Golden.
No memorial service has yet been announced.

Every year, USC awards millions of dollars of financial aid to students in the form of federal work-study funds that can be earned by working on campus. But for many students — particularly spring admits — finding a work-study job is proving to be an increasingly difficult task.
Spring awakening · Spring admits had the chance to get acquainted with the school at an orientation held earlier in the semester. Many spring admits are now looking for work-study jobs but having little success. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
“It just seems like no one is hiring,” said Stephanie Kim, a freshman spring admit majoring in psychology. “They’ll give you an application, but you won’t hear back.”
USC holds a job fair at the start of the fall semester, helping students find a way to earn their work-study funds. Most of the jobs fill quickly, however, and few open in the spring when spring admits start looking for work.
“Most departments are looking at the beginning of the year to project their staffing needs for the entire academic year,” said Alcyone Moore, director of human resources for enrollment services.
Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC Libraries, said the libraries hire about 450 students with work-study funds, but most of those spots are taken in the fall.
The library does offer some jobs in the spring, McHarg said, but the openings are not as abundant as they are at the beginning of the year.
“In the spring semester, we do rehire a majority of our student workers from the fall, but we typically have a significant number of new opportunities available for students seeking work when they return to campus in January,” McHarg said. “I do believe that we have people returning so I would estimate that there are less jobs available in the spring.”
Moore said the university has a variety of resources students can use to find a job, including the Career Center.
Still, she noted that the task is a difficult one, as many of the more popular jobs — including jobs at the Lyon Center and the USC Pertusati Bookstore — fill up early.
Finding little success on campus, some students have started looking off campus.
Annette Chung, a freshman spring admit majoring in architecture, said she looked for jobs at the International Residential College at Parkside downstairs desk, the Arts and Humanities Residential College at Parkside desk, Campus Cruiser and Leavey Library.
“But it kind of seemed like they weren’t accepting applications,” she said.
Off-campus jobs typically do not use work-study funds, though the pay is sometimes better. Still, Chung noted there are other disadvantages to the off-campus job search.
“I looked off-campus at L.A. Live for a job that paid $15 an hour,” Chung said. “But it’s too difficult to commute and I would rather stay on campus.”

Legendary CNN anchor Larry King spoke to a half-filled Bovard Auditorium Tuesday night, relaying humorous stories about his early life and his rise to fame, and also dispensing advice to aspiring journalists.
Live · Larry King, host of CNN’s Larry King Live, spoke to a half-filled Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday. King told stories from his life and discussed the future of journalism. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan 
The event was sponsored by USC Program Board, who hoped King’s story would provide a valuable learning opportunity for communication and journalism students.
King’s first experience as a broadcaster was at a small station in Miami Beach, Fla. on May 1, 1957. In the 53 years since then, he has conducted more than 40,000 interviews and won an Emmy and two Peabody awards.
King began by telling the audience he hadn’t planned any of his speech, which consisted of tales from his youth. Throughout the speech he had the audience laughing and engaged.
King never attended college, but he said he knew early on where he was going.
“I always wanted to be a broadcaster,” he said.
In 1957, he had a cleaning job at a Miami Beach radio station. One day, one of the radio personalities quit, so King, then known as Larry Zeiger, stepped in and soon gained local renown.
King told the audience about his experiences giving speeches, including at the Miami Shores Country Club, whose members, he joked, were ultra-conservatives who “handed out baby pictures of Rush Limbaugh saying ‘he is born.’” He also spoke for the Mafia once, he said.
King also told the story of the time he faked the death of his cousin in junior high school, saying that he and two friends collected $211 by asking for money to fund the funeral.
When he was done telling personal stories, King took questions from the audience.
“They charge this kind of tuition…” King started, laughing, when a microphone at the front of the auditorium wasn’t working.
One student asked King where he predicted the media was going.
“All of this overwhelms me — the Twitter, the Facebook,” King said. “Where is it going? I have no idea.”
King said his producer runs his Twitter page and that he merely dictates what goes up online. He described Twitter as an “egomaniac’s heaven.”
His advice for aspiring journalists was simply to focus on breaking into the business through any means possible.
He added that the key to success is to be yourself.
“The only secret in broadcasting is there’s no secret,” King said. “If you’re good enough, you’re good enough.”
Though the rain may have kept some would-be audience members from attending the sold-out event, those who did come said they enjoyed King’s stories.
“He’s way funnier than I was expecting,” said Katie Barker, a sophomore majoring in cinema production. “I really enjoyed his anecdotes about his personal life. You don’t get to hear that on his show.”
Students were surprised with King’s persona compared to what they are used to seeing on T.V.
“We got to see an aspect of his personality that doesn’t come through on T.V.,” said Greg Kestenbaum, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies. “He’s more jovial than I imagined.”
USG Director Beibei Bai, who coordinated the event, said one of the reasons the Program Board chose King to speak for this event is his experience conducting tens of thousands of interviews. Bai said she thought the discussion would be relevant to journalism and communication majors.
“I feel a lot of students don’t get the chance to talk to someone who’s an important figure in entertainment but on a serious note,” Bai said. “With King, it’s not purely entertainment.”
Just a small correction: The boy whose death he and his friends faked wasn’t his cousin, but a fellow classmate.

Electronic music of late has tended toward one of two extremes. On one end is music marked by a strong indie-rock influence, where synthesizers and computers are used to add layers to post-punk songs with droning vocals. On the other are the high-tempo, turned-up-to-11 songs that one hears at night clubs, the strain of techno in which each new song tries to outdo the previous one in terms of loudness and percussive ferocity.
This unfolds · Electronic musician Kieran Hebden releases his fifth solo album under the moniker Four Tet. There is Love in You is out now. - Photo courtesy of Domino Recording Co. 
Separate and distinct from this polarizing trend is Kieran Hebden. Created under the moniker of Four Tet, Hebden’s albums have been a collection of complex melodies that go against the mainstream sounds. His latest LP, There is Love in You, is an impressive set of emotional, introspective songs. Each track has an immersive nature, feeling both haunting and powerfully moving. With its reflective nature and unique approach to electronic music, the album is easily one of the best the genre has to offer.
There is Love in You feels in many ways like ambient music. It is quiet and never overpowering, without exploding drums or a thumping bass. Yet there is a level of complexity to the songs evocative of jazz music — if jazz was played using electronic musical instruments.
The songs are powerful and deep but without the intensity of a techno rave. “Plastic People,” easily the album’s most boisterous tune, feels most like a traditional dance song, but more serious undertones add depth and keep it from feeling too much like a pop song.
The album’s title isn’t just for show. Thematically, love and romance permeate the songs. The opening track, “Angel Echoes,” sets a strong tone. Featuring some of the album’s rare vocal drops, the mix of chorale vocals and chiming percussion gives the song a fragile, tender nature. The second track, “Love Cry,” is a nine-minute-long powerhouse with multiple layers of vocals and rhythms tied together by a catchy drum beat. “This Unfolds” is slower, but lends itself to an intimate, calm feeling.
Some tracks have a clear world music influence. “Sing” feels like something out of the Middle East even though its driving sound is a synthesizer. “Circling” brings to mind Mediterranean electronica, with subdued chants and an Iberian feel to the melody.
The album is in no way dark or depressing, but each song has a somber nature that evokes a quintessentially introspective tone. Despite its initial haunting chimes, however, the closing track “She Just Likes to Fight” ends the album on a hopeful note with an undercutting melody that brings to mind fresh starts, as if the album’s intimate exploration gives way to a brighter future.
It’s hard to pick a favorite from the bunch. Many techno songs run the risk of sounding too similar. Yet unlike his dance club-brethren, Four Tet makes each song distinct. All of the tracks share the same quiet nature but carry their own flavor. “This Unfolds” is wholly different from “She Just Likes to Fight,” for instance, but both work in their own distinct way.
There is Love in You isn’t a collection of remixes or some experimental album. Rather, it is a new effort from an artist confident in his own skills and tastes. There is Love in You is one of the best electronic albums in the past year and definitely one of the most unique. Intimate, haunting and highly immersive, Hebden’s latest release is incredibly powerful and perfect for sitting back and reflecting on life.

While Simon Cowell is busy roping in celebrities for his big, We-Are-The-World-esque R.E.M. cover, there are still many local, less A-list events going on across the L.A. area. If you missed Radiohead’s performance this past weekend and the Hope for Haiti telethon didn’t sap your charitable spirit, here are a few more recently announced upcoming shows aimed at helping the victims of the recent Haiti earthquake.

Help Haiti: A Benefit Show
Jan. 20 | $10
Cinespace
It’s locals only night as the independent Eastside gets together for a Hollywood Boulevard benefit show. Rock duo The Pity Party takes the stage with Pocahaunted, Letting Up Despite Great Faults and Morgan of Whispertown 2000 for a show with proceeds going to Operation USA’s current work in Haiti.  The charitable organization won a Nobel Peace Price in 1997, and the lineup is deep and entertaining.
Stand With Haiti: Tenacious D and Friends
Feb. 2 | $39.50-79.50
The Wiltern
The greatest heavy acoustic act rounded up a slew of friends for a show benefiting Partners in Health. Joining Jack Black’s band Tenacious D is Frank Black of the Pixies, comedian Patton Oswalt, James Mercer of The Shins, Bob Odenkirk of Mr. Show and others. Part concert, part comedy show and all philanthropic, the all-star event goes toward a reliable charity working toward a good cause.
“S.O.S. Saving Ourselves: Help For Haiti’’ telethon
Feb. 5 | FREE
Not technically a concert one can attend (unless, of course, you happen to be in Miami on Feb. 5), the S.O.S. Saving Ourselves: Help For Haiti telethon and concert is a star-studded evening put together by BET that will be aired simultaneously on all three Viacom channels — MTV, VH1, and BET — starting at 8 p.m. Although the final list has yet to be announced, Ludacris, Mary J. Blidge, Queen Latifah and Diddy have all signed on and appearances by Robin Thicke, Ciara and others have been rumored. If you can’t get out of the house but still want to see a good show and help the relief efforts, stay in Friday night and check this out.
KCRW Haiti Benefit Relief Concert
Feb. 6 | $25
El Rey Theater
An ethnically-rich locals-only benefit show features the multicultural, long-steady ska group Hepcat and  Cambodian-psychedelic rockers  Dengue Fever. Also on the bill is Brazilian-born lounge singer  Joey Altruda with a band featuring members of Fishbone, reggae-dub outfit The Lions and East Los Angeles cumbia group Very Be Careful. If your tastes run a bit ecletic (and you want an excuse to see a rare appearance from Hepcat), this is the show to check out.
Family Guy and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia Live
Feb. 12 | $59.50 – 89.50
Gibson Amphitheatre
The cast and creators of both Family Guy and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia come together for a one-night-only Haiti benefit show.  The cast of Family Guy will perform all of the show’s bawdy musical numbers — from the show’s theme song to Stewie and Brian’s duets — while the It’s Always Sunny crew will perform their infamous live rock-opera, “The Nightman Cometh.” The press release claims there are more yet-to-be-announced guests, but isn’t the presence of comedic television greatness enough? All proceeds will go to the Partners in Health’s emergency Haitian relief efforts.
Make it Better: An Evening of Comedy with Will Ferrell and Friends
Feb. 20 | $45 – 250
Nokia Theatre
Rob Riggle. Dimitri Martin. Zach “the one man wolfpack” Galifianakis. Tenacious D.  All these awesome comedians will join together with the USC alumnus-turned-Anchorman himself, Will Ferrell, for a concert meant to benefit Pete Carroll’s charity A Better L.A. When the earthquake struck in Haiti, Carroll’s local benefit show went global and the team set up a 2-for-1 ticket special with proceeds from one day of sales going to the Red Cross and its relief work in Haiti. The lineup is phenomenal, and, with the profits going towards both local efforts and the Haiti aid, it’s a show too good to pass up.

A response to Dr. Jackson
The purpose of this open letter is to seek clarification on your letter of Dec. 3, 2009, which defended the Muslim Student Union at USC. As an old Trojan, class of ’78, with an abiding love for my alma mater, I am concerned about the strong tone of censorship in your letter. In the 1970s, I remember robust political conversations on campus and no apparent effort by the faculty or administration to hamper dissenting commentary. Dr. Michael L. Jackson, I am confused by your frequent use of words “intolerance,” and “tolerance,” and I request that you more clearly define their meaning in the context of university policies. Are there no elements in the current and general practice of Islam that should not be tolerated? For example, should the florid anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism spewing from international and domestic Muslim media be tolerated? Are students at ’SC allowed to criticize Islamic practices in Saudi Arabia but not in Los Angeles? What are the rules?
I remember well the anti-Apartheid campus efforts at ’SC in the 1970s. Young men and women on campus organized to garner student awareness of racial separatism in South Africa. Certainly, students could not disrupt South African officials explaining and defending their political beliefs. But I do not remember any administrator requiring, in your words, “tolerance” and “respect” for belief systems based on discrimination. Should feminist organizations at ’SC campaign against gender apartheid in Islam, would you attempt to silence them? Must Jews tolerate and respect Koranic charges that they are the sons of apes and pigs? Must Christians stay silent about the vast persecutions of their communities throughout the Islamic world?
You declare the MSU to be “an outstanding organization,” and state that it has “never engaged in any activities that presented concerns to the university.” Why then did the administration require that the MSU remove a Hadith advocating killing Jews “hiding behind trees?” You criticize the accusation that the MSU “has ties” to the Muslim  Brotherhood, but you do not refute this charge. Would your opinion change if you had documentation corroborating ties to the Muslim Brotherhood? Would students at ‘SC then be permitted to openly criticize the MSU, and would you join them?
Does your demand for political tolerance extend to faculty at ’SC? Are you aware that Dr. David Lloyd, professor of English at USC, is a member in the U.S. Campaign for the Academic & Cultural Boycott of Israel? Is this tolerance? Does your demand for respect extend to the MSU? I read that the following commentary was offered on the USC MSU’s listserve; unedited, it would be news to the scholars at USC’s Shoah Foundation: “holocust schmolocost…..that whole thing drives me nuts. there arent that many holicost surviviers. most of those guys havent experienced anything — except possibly excess. its a tool the zionists use… but to be honest wonder how effective it is these days”
You conclude your letter with the requirement that “we each must pledge to encourage respect for human rights and dignity on our campus, in our society and in the global community.” But some students at ’SC feel that promoting human rights, particularly those of women, require criticizing the practice of Islam in many parts of the global community. Are you trying to silence them?
Thank you in advance for responding to this loyal son of Troy. I look forward to a dialogue with you and other professors at ’SC on this most important issue. Fight on!

“Dear Cat, there are many Jews on campus who WILL NOT tolerate anti-semitic Koranic slurs, anti-semitic Christian slurs, or any other type of anti-semitic slurs. If you can’t handle the fact that there are Jews who will stand up and defend our people’s name, transfer to Irvine, Berkeley, Fucla, or any unviersity in Europe. We make our presence felt on this campus and we don’t bend over for anyone!”
Neither will the people who will always seek justice. If you can’t tolerate criticism of Israel perhaps you should leave.
Wonderful comments. I am glad this old Trojan still has a voice. Fight on, fight on!
and Sol, this sort of proves how wary we have to be of trigger-happy people like you- Cat was trying to be ironic.
hahah what a bunch of deluded white people
how many women in this country are RAPED or MURDERED by their christian husbands or friends or partners? If you look up the statistics, you will find that these levels are much higher than in any Muslim country… Why do you not feel like you need to defend women in this country? If you actually cared about women, and not just about attacking Muslims, you would be working against misogyny in this country.
Dear Cat, there are many Jews on campus who WILL NOT tolerate anti-semitic Koranic slurs, anti-semitic Christian slurs, or any other type of anti-semitic slurs. If you can’t handle the fact that there are Jews who will stand up and defend our people’s name, transfer to Irvine, Berkeley, Fucla, or any unviersity in Europe. We make our presence felt on this campus and we don’t bend over for anyone!
Mr. Silinsky, as a fellow alumnus, I think your questions are important ones, but I *seriously* doubt that Jackson has any answers for them. This university is as politically perverted as any of them, and more than most. The only values USC officially “tolerates” are hatred of America and hatred of Jews.
To all Trojans commenting here, I would offer (translated from the French to English) the following quotation of François-Marie Arouet (AKA Voltaire). “I will disagree with you unto my death. Yet, I will defend unto my death your right to disagree with me.” Clearly, Dr. Jackson has weathered many decades as the VP for Student Affairs without having to use or display any administrative, let alone academic, gravitas. Though not a member of Phi Beta Kappa, I attended, as did the author of this open letter, the University of Southern California during the early to mid-1970’s and share the author’s sentiments for that time. Moreover, I am a third generation Trojan alumnus. In my direct personal and professional experience, Dr. Jackson has proven time and again the old adage we shared among ourselves as Trojan students, and still do as alumni: “You can tell a Stanford man… but you can’t tell him much.” As an aside, Dr. Jackson is publicly known to be currently lobbying for  Condoleezza Rice (a fomer Provost of Stanford) to become Dr. Sample’s successor. Given her record as US Secretary of State; if Muslim students feel oppressed now… just wait.
Fight On!
It’s the money . . . .
why do feminists give a pass at the way Muslim men and their family members kill their female relatives when they perceive their family honor tarnished, such as the poor girl who was choked to death near Toronto a few years ago “Asqua” by her Pakistani father and brother,.  Her crime was that she did not wear her bag on her head at school.  The list will get longer when these people are allowed to come into Western lands and do not assimilate into Western culture where freedom  is cherished by the lives taken  by our armed forces to keep us free.
Cat said:
“4. Feminist campaigns against Islamic misogyny? As if.”
Exactly. Where were all the feminists when Sarah and Amina Said were shot point blank in cold blood by their Muslim father on New Year’s Day 2008 in an honour killing sometime after their dad told Amina he could take her to Egypt, kill here there and no one would say “boo” about it? Sorry, feminists aren’t available to stand up for vulnerable Muslim teenaged girls. But tell people you’re going to show one little old commercial at the Super Bowl with a Heisman Trophy winner thanking his mom for not aborting him and they’ll be coming out of the woodwork like cockroaches.
I agree with everything people here have written, including the original letter in discussion. Not only should Islam be criticized but be forcefully dealt with. I mean if the Arab parties are upset about invading Gaza-ban them! If the Arabs don’t want to leave the homes they’ve lived in for 50 years-evict them! If Arab 12-year olds throw rocks at police-shoot them!
Perhaps that is some clarification.
Let’s save some time with the acceptable responses to the questions posed (though of course they may not be Dr. Jackson’s):
1. Are there elements in Islam that should not be tolerated?  No.  Criticism is colonialist, imperialist, and racist in all circumstances.
2. Criticism of Anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism in Islam should be permitted? No. See above.
3. Saudi Arabia v. America?  Any criticism is colonialist, imperialist, etc. How many times do we have to go over this?
4. Feminist campaigns against Islamic misogyny?  As if.  Most of them periodically don Muslimah headgear in “solidarity” with a Muslimah’s religiously-sanctioned right to be beaten, subjugated, dehumanized, genitally mutilated, and honor-killed. But at least they’re safe from the “male gaze.”
5. Must Jews tolerate Koranic slurs?  They will, if they know what’s good for them.
6. Must Christians remain silent about worldwide Islamic persecutions of their communities?  There are no such persecutions. Christians cannot be persecuted, as they are the ipso facto persecutors in all circumstances (see the Crusades, and see the Crusades.  Did I mention the Crusades?).
7. That F***** hadith about the talking trees and rocks?  There was no way to get out of removing that, there was way too much attention being paid to it. You’ll note that the thousands of other hateful, violent verses of the Koran and the Hadith are still there. Free speech, and all that, I guess until somebody notices those too.
8. Muslim Brotherhood ties?  Join in criticism of the MSA if they are proven? *dial tone*
Cat, you’re joking right?  I can only assume you had the sarcasm button held when you wrote those responses.  If you are serious, then you are simply part of the problem and an obstacle to any real debate about the merits of islam and the teachings/culture it brings with it.  Your responses are so over the top, that I had to laugh and believe it was a joke.
Even more scandalous than USC’s censorship is USC’s recent moves around the what had been a wonderful resource, its online copies of the Koran and the Hadiths.  First, it gave it renamed the website the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement, an innocuous but misleading label that implies it’s the failure to understand the contents of these Islamic scriptures that has led to all the trouble Moslems have with us.
*** 92:8 ***
Worse, there are indications that USC has allowed Moslem students to edit certain words in the texts to tone them down from what is actually said in the original Arabic.  For example, one might do an en masse Find/Replace to change the word “kill” to the word “defeat” or “vanquish” (this is a made up example, researchers more knowledgeable than I on the subject know the actual examples.
*** Bukhari Vol 6 Bk 60 Nbr 662 ***
But you shouldn’t be too upset, Mr. Silinky.  Your alma mater is like every other university in the Western world: They all on the one hand promote Islam through direct and indirect censorhip of any criticism of Islam’s highly questionable nature (i.e., its facts), and on the other hand will violate academic ethics to make Islam more opaque and thereby more palatable to a naive Infidel public — both in their respective student bodies and their surrounding general populations.
I doubt that you’ll get a “dialogue” with Dr. Jackson…his mind appears to be made up.
Political Correctness & the Muslim “FEAR Tactic” can make weak men cower.

President Obama has spent the last year proving to the world that no matter how great the person, and no matter how great their vision, they will fail to achieve any sort of meaningful progress if the system in place opposes their goals.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
Obama’s vision of a post-racial America that values its citizens’ lives, health and works to create a more just world order has been stymied at almost every turn by the realities of an internal climate of fear and a military industrial complex that seem to value profits over human lives and has worked actively to ensure that their interests, privileged by the Bush administration, go untouched by Obama’s reforms.
The first major stumbling block the president has encountered in trying to enact meaningful reform to better the lives of our citizens has been, shockingly enough, the people of the United States themselves. Eight years of neoconservative rule, marked by a steady erosion domestic freedom as well as questionable wars abroad, has managed to create a sense of constant fear. This fear is manifesting itself as a violent, racist and aggressive mentality among many in this country directed at Obama himself as well as at Democratic reforms in general.
In August, conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh likened policies of Obama’s to those of Adolf Hitler. Equating Obama to Hitler for attempting to reform a medical system that leaves 40 million Americans uninsured is absurd and absolutely insulting to the nearly 11 million Europeans exterminated in the Holocaust. The irrational anger manifested by millions of Americans against a health care system only makes sense in the context of the atmosphere of fear created by the Bush administration since 2000, a legacy that has stifled Obama’s attempts at internal reform.
Meanwhile, Obama’s attempts to develop a more benevolent and less imperialistic presence abroad have also been thwarted.
His policy in regard to Palestine is a small but notable example. Since 1948, the Palestinians have been a stateless people violently denied their right to exist by Israeli aggression and, after 1967, occupation and settlements — both of which are illegal under international law.
In recognition of these facts, Obama shifted the policies of his predecessors, which tended to side with the Israelis in the seemingly unending Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations of the last few decades.
The shift was not great — he merely demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu halt new construction in the settlements in the West Bank as a precursor to negotiations; the U.S. government currently gives Israel $2.8 billion a year in mostly military aid.
Netanyahu responded by all but rejecting Obama’s request, as his government has since announced that although it will abide by a 10-month freeze, it will still allow construction of 3,000 new housing units in the West exclusively for Jews. Though the U.S. administration hailed this temporary fix as an unprecedented step forward, it has revealed Obama’s ineffectiveness in foreign policy.
Though it remains to be seen what will come of this incident, Obama’s acceptance of this Israeli offer might tremendously damage America’s reputation tremendously across the Arab world and Muslim world, the exact people he called upon to engage with the United States and Israel in good faith during his landmark speech in Cairo months ago.
Obama is an intelligent and caring man, a fact that can be evidenced by any examination of his pre-campaign and pre-term literature. But so far, the last year has been a long series of disappointments, as his agenda of promoting stability, welfare and peace both domestically and abroad has been attacked at every corner by reactionary elements and feelings left in place by eight years of Bush rule.
Unless President Obama can find a way to win over various factions of the U.S. population still longing for a return to the Bush years and confront the enemies of peace, the military industrial complex as well as the remnants of the neoconservative movement both domestically and abroad, we are destined to see repeated failures on the part of a man who once inspired so much hope in all of us.

As President Barack Obama’s first year in office draws to a close, many have begun to wonder whether the president has taken steps to realize his campaign promises. If Obama’s falling approval ratings are any indication, the answer seems to be no.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
People simply don’t think President Obama has accomplished anything, citing the complete lack of progress in his health insurance reform as a prime example. Many are disappointed and feel betrayed by the promises he made. However, contrary to this sentiment, there has been undeniable change, evident looking at the big-picture implications of Obama’s work over the last year.
Health care reform has been a hot-button issue since the start of Obama’s candidacy. One of the main arguments against his initiative for health care reform is that it should not be his focus when the U.S. economy has been so weak. But in an economy that has limited the number of people able to afford health care, it is actually intimately connected to the economy.
Today, it is estimated that more than 46.3 million people do not have health insurance. Health care reform has been needed for decades; if it does not happen now,  when so many are in need, then when? There are more than 76 million baby boomers — about 28 percent of the U.S population — in the United States who will soon, if not already, be in need of serious health care . The fact is clear: Health care is a problem that needs to be addressed.
Yes, Obama promised health care reform in a timely manner. But Democrats have been trying to pass a national insurance plan for 60 years; how is Obama supposed to pass it in one?
While a bill has not yet been passed, Obama has accomplished much in the way of health care reform. In February of last year Obama signed the Children’s Health Insurance Reauthorization Act, which provided health insurance to 4 million children who did not previously have heath insurance.
President Obama also signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the ubiquitous “stimulus package” that made health coverage affordable with a 65 percent Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcilation Act subsidy for 7 million Americans who lost their jobs. Most importantly, the president’s Recovery Act invested $19 billion in computerized medical records (reducing costs while enhancing quality), provided a billion dollars in research money to give doctors better tools to make more informed decisions for their patients and also gave millions to help train new medical personnel. All of this was done in a year — true, there is no bill yet, but these are, nonetheless,  huge steps in the right direction.
Obama’s accomplishments don’t stop at health care; he has helped the economy as well. While critics have lamented that Obama has done nothing, that is far from the truth.
Many economists believed that the United States was headed toward a second Great Depression, based on various factors including the aggregate effect of war.
In response, Obama signed a highly criticized $787 billion stimulus bill and a $350 billion bailout of the banks in order to keep us out of a looming depression.
As a direct result of the stimulus, 2,500 highway projects have been approved — which are expected to create 260,000 jobs. Further, $115 billion dollars of the stimulus has been dedicated to modernizing schools and preserving jobs for teachers.
And with regard to the bank bailouts, Obama is not letting banks off the hook quite that easily, as he announced that he will implement stronger regulations on American banks’ proprietary trading and hedge fund operations. Now, one might say it is all talk, but it is important to realize what this talk is causing. It is believed that many politicians will follow Obama’s example of bank reform; Britain’s Conservative Party Treasury Rep. George Osbourne has said his party would take on similar bank reforms, striking fear in some European banks.
Obama’s accomplishments range from increasing federal grants and tax credits that help low-income students go to college to investing $50 billion in research for alternative forms of energy, to signing the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 that put thousands of acres of wilderness under federal protection (the largest in 15 years) and even to approving California Emissions standards that George W. Bush blocked for six years.
Obama has also revolutionized politics by bringing it up to speed with today’s technology. From the start of his campaign, Obama utilized the Internet — even Facebook. Communication with the Obama administration is simple with, for the first time ever, a White House blog and online question-and-answer sessions. Obama is entirely open with the people of the United States, which is a refreshing change.
But Obama’s biggest accomplishment is not tangible — it’s a change in people. I see more people who are informed and involved in politics and, I see more people with hope that there will be change. Most importantly, I see more people who actually feel that we, as a nation, are heading in the right direction. I am still astounded to see how packed the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism lobby gets each time Obama is about to give a speech.
President Obama has accomplished so much in only one year. Instead of focusing on the latest setbacks, let’s look at the big picture. Our president has been able to accomplish in one year what has taken other presidents four years, eight years or not at all. Problems that have been building for decades cannot be fixed in a single year, but, at the pace President Obama is going, America will reach its goals much faster.

For a different view on Obama’s first year in office, read an article by Alex Shams.
In other words, all you can point to for “accomplishments” are acts of spending countless billions of our dollars on programs that make liberals hearts go a-flutter. The fact that the economy is in the dumps and getting worse doesn’t dampen your enthusiasm for spending $800 billion dollars on a bunch of pork, hundreds of billions to bail out companies that donated to Democrat campaigns, and so forth. Do you honestly believe that the left’s INTENTION to rescue the economy matters more than the FACT that the left has damaged it so horribly?
I agree with you on one point though — the best thing Obama can take credit for is that a LOT more people are excited, informed, and energized about politics… and more people with “hope that there will be change” in November.
oh, I didn’t realize something in the OPINION section had to include your views too
Sandoval…why are we not surprised at this one-sided-piece-of “journalism” ?
Sounds like an APOLOGY more than anything else. And..
Why was there no mention of the illegal aliens?

USG hopes to have a new Commuter Virtual Resource Center website running by the first week of March, according to Commuter Senator Jean Doh.
The new Commuter Virtual Resource Center will be attached to the USG website and contain links to information about hotspots on and off campus, such as ATMs, library hours, computer labs, maps, parking, and dining establishments.
Originally, the commuter senators had hoped to create an actual physical space for commuters and transfer students.
“At the moment, funding and finding space for an actual commuter, transfer resource lounge or center was kind of out of the question,” Doh said. “Next year, in the new campus center there’s going to be tons of space for lounging areas for commuter students as well as transfer students … they’re incorporated into the plans for the new campus center.”
Doh said the website is aimed at helping commuter students feel more connected to USC.
“It’s very student run, its not a professional website or anything like that,” Doh said. “But it is a step towards providing more resources for commuters; making commuter senators more accessible to commuters and making the resources that USC does have for commuters and transfers more transparent.”
USG will constantly be making additional changes to keep the website up-to-date and more useful to students.
“Once the commuters and transfers start giving us feedback on whatever’s important to them, that’s the direction that the website will go in,” Doh said. “Students who are first-comers at USC or are transfer students at USC or who have been commuting here and don’t know a lot about the campus, they can just go to this website and find out basic information.”
Doh hopes the website will help bridge the gap between commuters and the commuter senators.
“We’re taking that step towards making them more aware of who we are and what we do and that we actually do exist and that they’re represented in USG,” Doh said.

When exams are bearing down and the munchies kick in at 3 a.m., if it’s between ice cream and peanut butter, I’m going for the peanut butter.
Creamy, crunchy and tinged with kindergarten nostalgia, peanut butter is a great food for traveling and snacking. But just as your world was rocked when you discovered cheese beyond Kraft Singles, the world of peanut butter is far more delicious and decadent than a boring bottle of Jif. 
Best of all? Despite what the nutritional label might tell you, peanut butter isn’t fattening. Well, it’s only fattening if you eat too much of it, but the fats in peanut butter are largely monosaturated, which are good for cardiovascular health. Also, peanut butter has high amounts of vitamin E, niacin and antioxidants, making it a disease-fighting machine on bread, a spoon or a piece of celery. And don’t waste your time with reduced fat peanut butter — it’s devoid of good fats and substituted with sugary fillers instead.
Don’t stockpile the Skippy, though. These nice peanut butter facts don’t apply to most of the mass-produced stuff on the supermarket shelves. Like most regular commercial peanut butters, Skippy is loaded with preservatives and sugar.
For ultimate peanut butter effectiveness, go natural instead.
Natural peanut butters are usually only made with salt and peanuts. Sometimes they contain palm oil stabilizers, but that’s just to prevent the oil separation you might have noticed when opening a jar of Laura Scudder’s. Stabilizers or not, natural peanut butters have a richer, more roasted taste because the peanuts are put out there front and center.
Though au naturel butters in general cost a little more than their trans-fatty counterparts, the top natural butter for low cost and high taste is Trader Joe’s,
Some recognizable brands have also started making their own natural peanut butter — including Jif and Skippy — but the best is Smucker’s Natural.
Another peanut butter trend popping up in jars across the nation is to incorporate flaxseed into the peanuts. This increases the omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, making the product more healthy than ever. The tastiest of these flax-peanut hybrids is Naturally More, which has created a crunchy little butter with a deliciously sweet, nutty flavor.
Flavored peanut butters are also leaping into popularity. Not all stores carry them, but that’s also slowly changing. The New York-based Peanut Butter and Co. sells peanut butter flavors such as dark chocolate dreams and mighty maple. Naturally Nutty, a smaller, organic brand, has an award-winning flavor known as Butter Toffee. Sunland Peanut Butter, however, takes the concept and blows it wide open with sweet, savory and fruity flavors. A few standouts of its repertoire are caramel, raspberry and hickory smoked.
Hickory smoked peanut butter might sound like an extreme, but Katalin Coburn, vice president of Sunland, says it still all starts with the nuts. Sunland only uses Valencia peanuts, which gives its peanut butter a unique flavor and a natural sweetness. Additionally, the dense Valencias are high in antioxidants.
But butter bliss does not end with peanuts. Any nut or seed can be made into a butter, from almonds to hemp seeds. Nutritionally diverse, forgiving of peanut allergies and useful in all sorts of cooking adventures, nut butters can do a lot to beef up your pantry.
Standouts include almond butter, which is the closest alternative to peanut butter. Almonds are one of the most nutritious nuts, rich in healthy fats, potassium and magnesium. Spread almond butter on toast or stir it into oatmeal for a rich, hearty breakfast. Trader Joe’s makes an excellent almond butter that is blessedly cheap. Other good brands are MaraNatha, found in most supermarkets, and Barney Butter, which is made nearby in Fresno, Calif.
Cashew butter — another alternative — is light, sweet and creamy. It tastes better on things than straight from the jar — in fact, it’s the perfect base for no-bake goods such as icebox cookies. Cashews are also lower in fat than most nuts and contain high levels of copper, an essential mineral. MaraNatha makes the most accessible brand, but it’s cheaper to just dump a bunch of cashews in a blender with a splash of milk or water and give it a whirl.
Sesame seed butter, better known as tahini, is what gives your hummus that savory kick. Beyond baba ganoush, however, tahini tastes great drizzled on apples and berries or used as part of a salad dressing. For the best tahini, head to Israel, but if you’re stuck in the United States, Joyva and Whole Foods market’s house brand are dependable.
Sunflower seed butter is a delectable mix of sweet and savory. Equally delicious on toast or vegetable crudités, sunflower butter adds variety to any pantry. Packed with selenium, zinc and iron, it’s also great for you. The best brand, hands down, is SunButter.
Hemp seed butter is for nutty connoisseurs — it tastes a little bit like flax-covered walnuts and can go sweet or savory depending on what it’s served with. Hemp seeds are also a nutritional powerhouse of omega-3s and 6s with oodles of protein and antioxidants. Manitoba Harvest, a Canadian-based hemp company, makes an especially tasty butter.
So embrace traditional peanut butter and its many delicious cousins. They are great for your heart and taste buds, fit into any dorm room and can compliment a hundred different recipes. And, of course, when homesickness kicks in, there’s always the good old PB&J.

Since 2006, when Taylor Mays first took the field as the Trojans’ starting safety, fans became accustomed to the Seattle native’s highlight-reel hits, subtle speed and uncanny physical presence.
Hard hitter · Senior safety Taylor Mays, seen here against UCLA, has made a big statement at the Senior Bowl with his high-impact tackles. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Whether it was the knockout blow he delivered on Arizona running back Keola Antolin during a 2008 clash with the Wildcats or the jaw-dropping hit he laid on Penn State’s Jordan Norwood in the 2009 Rose Bowl, Mays’ collegiate career was defined by the reckless abandon with which he patrolled the Trojans’ secondary.
So it was no surprise to NFL coaches and scouts that the most memorable play at practice for the 2010 Under Armour Senior Bowl during the past few days came from the former Trojan.
At the South Team’s first practice in Mobile, Ala., Mays treated the throng of reporters, NFL scouts and team administrators in attendance to the level of physicality the 6-foot-3, 230-pound safety expects to bring at the next  level.
Unfortunately for wide receiver Andre Roberts, who hails from the small Football Championship Subdivision school of Citadel, the memo of Mays’ devastating hits must not have made its way to South Carolina.
On what appeared to be a simple seam route, Oklahoma State quarterback Zac Robinson delivered the ball to Roberts in stride. One problem: Mays was trailing Roberts. Within seconds of catching the pass, Roberts was nailed by the USC safety, who dislodged the ball and left a captive audience ooh-ing and ahh-ing.
One complaint of NFL scouts is that Mays, in his fervor for hard hitting, is often overly zealous in pursuing the hit instead of making the right play.
On the next play, Robinson badly overthrew Colin Peek, a tight end from Alabama. Mays, who would have been in perfect position to capitalize on the poor throw, instead went in for a monstrous hit on Peek. The tight end avoided the safety and the ball hit the ground  and a chance to make a big play was wasted for Mays, a probable first-round draft pick.
Mays, who before the 2009 college football season found himself as a top-10 candidate on draft prognosticator Mel Kiper’s big board for the 2010 NFL Draft in April, has seen his stock drop after an up-and-down season that saw the Trojans finish an underwhelming 9-4.
Trojan offensive tackle Charles Brown, who Kiper predicts will land somewhere in the second round of the April draft, will be forced to sit out of all Senior Bowl activities because of a calf strain.
Senior offensive lineman Jeff Byers and tight end Anthony McCoy also made the trip to Mobile, hoping to improve their draft status as well. Both McCoy and Byers are currently projected as second-day picks.
Former Trojan running back Stafon Johnson made his much-anticipated return to the football field for Senior Bowl practices this week, just over three months removed from his horrific weight-lifting accident that threatened his life and ended his senior season. NFL scouts worry about Johnson’s injury, but, for the Trojans’ leading rusher in 2008, just being back on the field was a welcomed sight in Mobile.
What the bonehead forgot to remember is that this was a no contact drill and was berated pretty good by coaches because of it!  This is the kind of thing that scouts and coaches consider in the draft — is the guy disciplined?

As the dim stage lights slowly went up, Monday night’s performance at Bovard Auditorium took an unexpected start when a veiled bride sprinted across the stage, arguing with her mother in the distance. This unusual, yet gripping, start laid the foundation for a remarkable evening of inspiration in the story of one man’s struggle against racism and police brutality in his search for home.
Going solo · Co-written by R. Ernie Silva (above right) and novelist James Gabriel, “Heavy Like the Weight of a Flame” follows Silva’s travels through America as a troubled youth. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan
Heavy Like the Weight of a Flame, an autobiographical solo show performed by R. Ernie Silva, a third-year Master of Fine Arts acting student, offered a chaotic, whirlwind glimpse into one man’s tumultuous life. The show, co-written by Silva and novelist James Gabriel, chronicled Silva’s walkabout through America as a young, troubled artist searching for purpose.
Accompanied by only a guitar and a rudimentary set of black boxes on stage, Silva shared various episodes of his life story: growing up in Brooklyn a rare bookworm among drug-addicted peers and siblings, leaving home to join a group of train-hopping wanderers, and living for weed-induced highs and thriving on refunds from shoplifted items, his family’s discouraging words echoing in his head all the while.
“Some stories have sad endings,” his Puerto Rican mother once told him, and he didn’t soon forget it. The performance reflected Silva’s refusal to end up like his brothers, all of whom eventually succumbed to their drug addictions.
Despite the serious note of the performance, the audience quickly picked up on both Silva’s unique ability to play multiple characters in a variety of scenarios and the comic timing with which every line was executed. Silva demonstrated an enormous level of comfort and control through every scene as the performance jumped from serious moments to break-dance routines, even incorporating a refreshing dose of standup comedy to lighten the mood.
Leaping about the stage like a wound-up toy, Silva reenacted scenes from his cross-country odyssey — scenes alternately humorous and harrowing — with convincing sentiment, portraying a multitude of characters with ease.
His lean, athletic build proved especially helpful here, allowing him the versatility to take on the shape and idiosyncrasies of each character. During his journey through the Appalachian Mountains, trains across the Midwest and a haunting stop in jail, Silva thoughtfully brought insight and humor to his experiences after escaping Brooklyn.
Most affecting was the earth-shattering moment when Silva answered the call relaying his brother’s death — the moment that changed everything for him. Despite the powerful emotion frequently felt in Silva’s performance, one rarely had time to process it. Transitioning from somber monologues about his brother’s death to energetic Jimi Hendrix impersonations in a matter of seconds, Silva sent alternating waves of sober chills and riotous laughter through the audience, rendering the show just as paradoxical as its title.
Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
Such quick, drastic changes of mood can get tiring, however, and Silva’s disjointed, schizophrenic show could have used some breathing room and perhaps a bit more structure. Still, it was obviously more important to Silva that he keep the show real rather than execute a rigidly choreographed act. Accordingly, the show was ballsy, laid back and rough around the edges in a way that scripted performances rarely dare to be.
The show ended on an open-ended epiphany, with a visit from an eagle heralding the continuation of Silva’s journey and inspiring him to go on. The inspiring message was a familiar one, encouraging strength in the face of great adversity.
The very story behind Heavy Like the Weight of Flame might sound familiar, but Silva was anything but unoriginal. His frenetic performance was unpredictable and surprising, sprinkled with moody guitar interludes, impassioned acting and frank monologues.
It takes a lot of personality to carry a one-man show, and, with Heavy Like the Weight of a Flame, this graduate student proved he’s got plenty to go around.
And go around it will: Silva’s show will be heading out from Los Angeles to New York, San Diego and Chicago in the coming months.

Even with a new regime taking over at Heritage Hall, it appears USC has been able to retain much of the recruiting class many feared it would lose after former coach Pete Carroll left his post earlier this month.
According to the recruiting service Rivals.com, the team’s 2010 recruiting class is ranked seventh nationally.
But despite the team’s high marks, it doesn’t appear as if USC coach Lane Kiffin is slowing down his recruiting push. With a short amount of time left in the recruiting season, the Trojans are now targeting two of the country’s most prominent offensive linemen: Giovanni Di Poalo of St. Bonaventure High School in Ventura, Calif. and Chaz Green of Tampa Catholic in Tampa Bay, Fla.
Di Poalo is expected to sign with the Trojans next Wednesday after reportedly enjoying his official visit this past weekend. Currently, ESPN lists Di Poalo as the 38th-ranked offensive guard and describes him as one of the best run blockers in the country, which would be a welcome addition to a USC running game that struggled last season.
In addition to Di Poalo, the Trojans remain in the hunt for offensive tackle Green, who was once committed to Tennessee before Kiffin left for USC. Despite his size, the 320-pound Green is regarded by many scouts as one of the more athletic linemen in this class.
Green is also being actively pursued by Florida, Ohio State, Tennessee as well as USC and is scheduled to visit campus this weekend.

According to statements from USC, quarterback Matt Barkley underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right wrist Tuesday morning.
Barkley reportedly hurt his wrist early in the season, leaving him with stiffness and inflammation. Although he sat out against Washington because of a shoulder injury, no reports of a wrist injury were ever disclosed by USC. Just like the shoulder, the wrist injury is on his throwing arm.
Barkley is expected to make a full recovery and participate in spring practice in March, where he and senior Mitch Mustain will compete for the starting job under new head coach Lane Kiffin.
“It’s just a minor cleanup. He’s going to be ready for spring practice,” Barkley’s personal quarterback coach Steve Clarkson told ESPN. “But he needed to get the surgery. He’d hurt it early in the year, back around the Ohio State game, and he just played with it. It was affecting his ability to turn his thumb down and throw a spiral with any consistency.”
Barkley passed for 2,735 yards and 15 touchdowns as a freshman in 2009 as the Trojans finished 9-4. He threw for 350 yards and two touchdowns, in addition to running for a score, in a 24-13 win against Boston College in the Emerald Bowl on Dec. 26, 2009.
Barkley’s first season with the Trojans ended up being the first time in eight years that USC failed to make a BCS bowl, breaking a streak that dated back to the 2002 Orange Bowl against Iowa.

The day that nobody thought would come is upon us.
Well, almost nobody.
“The day I had a doubt would have been the day I failed as a person,”  former USC running back Stafon Johnson told the Press-Register in Mobile, Ala. last week. “I knew I’d be back.” 
For the first time since carrying a ball on Sept. 26, 2009, for the first time since dropping a 275-pound bar on his neck four months ago, crushing his larynx and tearing his right vocal cord away from its mooring, the first time since he spoke again two months ago, Stafon Johnson will take the field and play in a game with college football fans across the nation watching.
Tim Tebow may rule the headlines at the Senior Bowl, and even though most of the other top seniors in the country aren’t participating in Saturday’s game. When Tebow, college football’s biggest star, hands off to college football’s most inspirational story — Johnson will have completed one of the most inspiring and remarkable stories in recent memory.
Although he won’t be able to be the vocal team leader he was throughout his career (he speaks now in a raspy voice), and though a quarterback tucked the ball into Johnson’s cradling arms 271 times during his career at USC, every handoff he takes on Saturday will be a handoff he almost never got.
Here’s a person many people thought might not survive following his horrific accident on the morning of Sept. 28. Doctors said that a lesser man would have died. But not Johnson. He fought for his life, and, because of his strong physical and mental character and his strong drive to pursue a dream, he willed himself back onto the field.
Maybe he remembered the speech Jim Valvano gave at the 1993 ESPY Awards; Follow your dream and never give up. It may sound cliché, but, in an age of laziness and complacency, our society is all too willing to lie down and give into adversity.
This is a fact not lost on Under Armour (a sponsor of the Senior Bowl) founder and CEO Kevin Plank, who sent a personal letter of congratulations to Johnson this week. In his letter, Plank acknowledged that Johnson’s presence on the field will “serve as a powerful reminder of the tremendous courage, determination and strength you continue to display in the face of adversity,” and he admits to being “humbled by your journey, which has only just begun.”
Return · Senior running back Stafon Johnson nearly lost his life after a weight room accident crushed his larynx. However, after a three-month absence from the gridiron, Johnson will take the field for the Senior Bowl. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Indeed, when Johnson steps onto the field Saturday, it will be the first step in what he hopes will lead to a promising professional career. Although he only played four games last year, he opted not to take a medical redshirt and, instead, turn pro following USC’s last game,
Many seniors opt to forgo the Senior Bowl and regard it as a week not woth participating in. Big names such as Nebraska defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, Clemson running back C.J. Spiller and Texas linebacker Sergio Kindle will all skip the game on Saturday, as they  probably see they have very little room to improve their draft position.
This clearly isn’t the case for Johnson.
In fact, this entire week, not just the game, will go a long way in determining where Johnson lands in the draft. NFL Draft Countdown has him rated as the 13th best running back available. Of course, this is mainly based off his junior season, and Johnson can do a lot this week to boost his stock.
However, Johnson’s neck remains the big concern. There is no doubt that the crowd will go silent in the stadium the first time Johnson takes a hit. The bigger question will be how he holds up after getting hit repeatedly by people much heavier than 275 pounds (see Alabama nose tackle Terrence Cody, who would have broken any normal household scale last week when he weighed in at 370 pounds).
Once he jumps up off the turf, Johnson will be thrust into an unfamiliar role in a familiar setting.
Though he will be surrounded by familiar faces at the bowl (former USC players Taylor Mays, Anthony McCoy and Jeff Byers are also participating) and will have a familiar role as one of the featured running backs, he will no longer be the anonymous, powerful running back churned out by the USC factory.
He will be Stafon Johnson, the man who took one of life’s most powerful blows to the jugular and fought back to win.
We can all learn from that.

It’s his job to be excited.
Leader · Senior guard Dwight Lewis has seen teammates come and go during his four years in a Trojan uniform. Lewis, however, kept his promise to graduate from USC and has helped the Trojans overcome some tough stretches this season. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
But when Galen Center announcer Petros Papadakis calls out the starting lineup just before each USC men’s basketball home game, the name of senior guard Dwight Lewis garners a noticeably bigger — and louder — reaction from those in attendance.
“Big-time Dwight Lewis,” Papadakis proclaims, in that distinct Papadakis way.
Forgive him if he gets a little excited when Lewis comes onto the floor. He’s the only player Papadakis has seen progress from freshman to senior in the Trojans’ program.
On a team with just three seniors, Lewis stands alone as the only one to stay with the USC basketball program for four years.
Coming out of Taylor High School in Texas, he was recruited by big-name schools like Kansas, Florida and Wake Forest but eventually chose USC above the tradition and big names of the other programs.
“I was sold on the school and the program, and I always wanted to be a Trojan,” Lewis said.
As a freshman, Lewis played an important role off the bench, averaging nearly six points in 20 minutes per game.  In his sophomore season, Lewis stepped into the starting lineup and ranked second on the team in points scored.
Despite being largely outshined by “one-and-done” prep star O.J. Mayo that year, Lewis put together a solid season and helped the Trojans earn their second consecutive NCAA tournament berth.
In his junior year, Lewis was once again overshadowed by a freshman. This time, it was highly recruited prep star DeMar DeRozan.
But quietly, Lewis was the leading scorer on the team. He helped the Trojans earn a Pac-10 tournament championship and an automatic bid to their third-straight NCAA tournament appearance.
After the season, former coach Tim Floyd resigned, DeRozan jumped to the NBA and Taj Gibson and Daniel Hackett passed over their final years of eligibility to play professionally as well.
But Lewis decided to buck the trend and return for his senior season, sticking to a promise he made his parents years before.
“I told my parents I’d graduate,” Lewis said. “But whatever happens after that, happens.”
With Lewis the only returning starter, however, the team struggled to find any consistency or chemistry early in the season.
The Trojans opened up the year by with a 2-4 record, losing two closely contested home games to Loyola Marymount and Nebraska. They also struggled on the road against then-No. 2 Texas and Georgia Tech.
Lewis was slow to embrace his new role as the number one scoring option. He’d been the number three — even the number four — option in past years, so being the primary target was a big change.
“It was harder than I expected it to be,” Lewis said.
But soon thereafter, redshirt senior point guard Mike Gerrity and sophomore forward Leonard Washington became eligible to play, and the Trojans started clicking. With another senior to help shoulder the weight of leading the team, the Trojans strung together an impressive run of eight straight victories, including a 22-point upset of then-No. 9 Tennessee.
Lewis played a key role in  victories over Western Michigan and St. Mary’s. He and Gerrity then helped the Trojans take down then-No. 20 Nevada Las Vegas in the final game of the Diamond Head Classic to win the tournament.
The Trojans then carried their winning streak into conference play, opening up with victories at home against Arizona and Arizona State.
During the streak, the Trojans, led by Lewis, locked down on defense, limiting their opponents to a combined 32.5 field goal percentage and less than 50 points per contest.
“He’s done a really good job of stepping up and leading by example,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said of Lewis.
However, the upbeat feeling of the winning streak was struck down by some surprising news.
The Trojans’ season hit another rough patch when USC self-imposed sanctions on the basketball team for violating NCAA rules during the 2007-2008 basketball season, removing any possibility that the Trojans would be eligible for postseason play this year in a hit that cast a shadow on Lewis’ final season in Cardinal and Gold.
But Lewis believes there is still more than enough reason to play.
“We’re still in contention for the Pac-10 title, and it’s our goal to win that,” Lewis said. “We can’t just fold for our fans because they’ve been so loyal to us.”
Not surprisingly, the Trojans were slow to shake off the after-effects of the sanctions, losing their next two conference games at the hands of Stanford and California.
The sanctions put a damper on what had looked like a promising season for Lewis and the Trojans, but their next game against crosstown rival UCLA gave them a chance to prove that they weren’t down for the count.
Neither would disappoint.
The normally laid-back Lewis had a noticeable bounce in his step, pounding his chest, slashing to the basket and draining 3-pointers from all areas.
It looked like he had something to prove.
It looked like he wanted to make a statement.
He did.
“It was my last time at Pauley [Pavilion], and I just wanted to leave it all out on the floor,” Lewis said. “I didn’t want to hold anything back.”
Lewis finished with a game-high 24 points, helping the Trojans end their losing streak. He and the team refused to fold.
“He played really, really hard,” O’Neill said. “He played with positive emotion and he hyped our team up the way he played.”
And now, despite getting off to a rocky start, the Trojans have won 10 of their last 13 games and are currently tied with four other teams for second place in the       Pac-10 standings.
“I’ve been very proud of how we’ve played through a lot of distractions,” O’Neill said. “Even with the sanctions, we had to overcome a lot of obstacles in the beginning … guys being ineligible, guys getting hurt … So I’ve admired the way our guys have stuck together this season.”
Lewis’ leadership and experience will surely be counted on and needed for the 11 games that comprise the rest of the season, especially in light of the self-imposed sanctions and the distractions on and off the court.
The coaching staff, Lewis’ teammates and Trojan fans alike will all be looking for him to step up.
Big time.

Mission Bay multipurpose athlete Dillon Baxter could have made all of the local San Diego fans happy by staying in the area and attending San Diego State, but that was never a thought in his mind as he verbally committed to USC long ago after his freshman season.
However, he backed off that commitment and opened up his recruitment after Pete Carroll left Los Angeles for Seattle and the chance to return to the NFL. The 6-foot, 205-pound physical specimen said playing for Carroll was his dream and part of his dream had died when Carroll departed leaving many to believe he would play elsewhere.
But last week, Baxter made the Trojan faithful ecstatic when the U.S. Army All-American Bowl Player of the Year announced on San Diego’s KUSI that he was reaffirming his commitment to play for USC. He should be on campus by next week as an early-enrollee, so that he is eligible to participate in spring practice.
While he declined the opportunity to attend San Diego State, he is very similar to a former Aztec by the name of Marshall Faulk. Like Faulk coming out of high school, there are questions surrounding what position Baxter will play due to his extreme versatility.
This past season, playing primarily at the quarterback position, Baxter set a new California record as he accounted for 76 touchdowns – 50 rushing and 26 passing. He also broke the San Diego Section record for rushing yard with 2,974 yards to go along with 1,922 passing yards as he led Mission Bay to the San Diego Division IV title and an undefeated season. In the championship game, he rushed for 384 yards and scored seven times.
Even though he completed 61 percent of his passes and only threw seven interceptions, Baxter will most likely be in the backfield as a tailback or taking direct snaps in the “Wildcat”  formation, which Baxter has been reassured will be installed.
With great speed and precise route-running, the 2009 MaxPreps Player of the Year could also see time in the slot, ala former San Diego and USC product Reggie Bush, who Baxter is often compared to (along with another San Diego product Marcus Allen, who also played quarterback and running back in high school).
Baxter has shown the ability to catch the ball and proven to be elusive in the open field. With the departure of Damien Williams and his playmaking ability to the NFL, don’t be surprised if Kiffin tries to find a way to get Baxter the ball in space, and you can see why…

The Congressional Budget Office approximates the United States budget deficit of 2009 at $1.414 trillion dollars. Projected deficits for the coming year, assuming the same laws of 2009 (not including new spending initiatives like health care), predict decreasing yet similar deficits. 
In the past, the U.S. government only ran deficits to finance wars, and did this through World War I. Since 1940, with World War II and the New Deal, budget deficits have been employed to rescue the United States from recessionary economic times. Consequently, a significant portion of the U.S. budget pays out a large sum to growing interest for past debts, while borrowing more to pay current deficits.
This government spending scheme, which characterized much of the 20th century, and now the 21st, oddly resembles something we witnessed crash in December 2008 with Bernard Madoff. Bernie was arrested and convicted in 2009 for his operation of a massive Ponzi scheme, or now more appropriately titled “Madoff scheme.”
Madoff schemes work as such: The scheme operator invites new people to pay a base investment. He gets them to join by promising high returns as dividends. He pays these dividends using base investments from new investors. This cycle requires new investors to constantly join.
This scheme is considered illegal because it “inevitably must fall apart.” Even if every person in the world joined, the scheme would fail. But it always fails before it gets anywhere close.
For this fraudulent business, Bernie was prosecuted and publicly castigated. But he was very faithful in his promised returns of 10 to 17 percent to his clientele. Once recession hit, he could no longer get new investors to join while his current investors opted to leave, causing his failure to pay dividends and ultimately unraveling.
This business is illegal for people, but not for Uncle Sam. Our politicians promise unnaturally high economic growth and maintain it by continually borrowing large amounts from foreign nations. The politicians, particularly presidents, care not if this will eventually fail since their careers will likely end before then. Or, if politicans did try to stop the government-run Madoff scheme, constituents would be the ones with empty pockets and ultimately try to remove the officials who took a stand from office.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
Elected officials face an interesting dichotomy: Should they cause a temporary slowdown in economic growth (by stopping unsustainable borrowing) and lose their political position; or do they maintain the status quo, keeping their jobs yet forsaking forthcoming generations?
Conversely, we unwisely elect politicians based on the heaviness of our wallets and thereby neglect our future children.
Just like Bernie’s business, our Capitol Hill leaders strive for economic growth (investor returns) by spending money (paying dividends to investors) beyond tax revenue and finance it by borrowing from foreign nations (inviting new investors).
This manner of spending yields a temporary gain, just as using a credit card allows us to buy a few goods that we would struggle to otherwise purchase. We usually realize, however, that we cannot payoff incessant credit card debts with more credit cards. It works for a few months but always catches up.
The same principle is true for Madoff schemes. It pays off for a while but always catches up with the scheme’s promoter. New investors stop and the scheme crashes leaving the promoter imprisoned and the investors broke.
People in credit card debt and those managing ponzi schemes do not get to walk away. They are stuck with it until they pay it off, go bankrupt or go to jail.
But Uncle Sam is different. He gets to walk away, usually after something like four or eight years. He never faces the long-term consequences. The failure of the scheme never catches up on a personal level. He just passes them on to the next person in line and takes credit for “improving” the economy. And he performs this with complete legality, unlike Bernie.
Our legal system offers great incentive to prevent this sort of Madoff fraud in business and daily life. Yet we, the people, fail to hold our government accountable for this fraud that jeopardizes our future welfare.
Since it seems politicians often care more about the continuity of their careers without regard to our long-term welfare, we must incentivize our politicians to think in the long term by electing those that will. This is a problem of democratic politics: Who is willing to make the unpopular decision necessary for the long-term economic viability of the United States?
No generation has been willing to step up and pay down American debt for their children. Shall we imitate our parents and pass it on to our kids? Let us be the generation that considers our children’s and their children’s welfare before our own. With this leadership, we would become a great generation.

Excellent column. But you’re wrong about one thing. The voters who elected Presidents Harding and Taft did want to pay off the government debt, on behalf of their decendants.

Posters around the Annenberg building seem to be the only indication that Larry King will be on campus tonight. But what exactly is he doing here? The 11×17 advertisement (most clearly visible in the ASC elevator foyer) for the event is, at best, ambiguous and at worst, visually deceptive.
Using images of the television host from his long-running CNN interview program, and incorporating the show’s colored stage lighting and RCA microphone background and silver embossed logo font, the poster seems to be, at least on first glance, official Larry King Live propaganda.
Aside from taking advantage of Up Style newspaper headlines and titling the event “Larry King Live!” the fact that the on-campus event lasts for one hour — perfect interview-show length — gives passerbys the illusion that an episode of Larry King Live will be filmed at Bovard with free admission to USC students.
But a closer look at the event’s description reveals that although Larry King Live will not be broadcasting from the grand ballroom of Trousdale, Larry King will be live and “sharing his remarkable journey in the entertainment and journalism industry” instead, which, in a sense, could be an even greater opportunity.
A slight bummer that the king of call-outs won’t be transporting his set over to UPC like he did for Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon (I had hopes!), but instead of watching King talk to other people about their questionably interesting lives, this is a rare opportunity to hear the man usually wielding the questions talk about himself.

With universities increasingly using claims of diversity to draw attention and applicants, a recent analysis by the University of Denver indicates that schools — including USC — may be less regionally diverse than they appear.
The analysis looked at schools that are nationally known and examined the regional breakdown of their students. Though USC has the largest international population of any school in the country, it might be less of a national university than is sometimes assumed — a full 60 percent of the freshmen class come from within 200 miles of Los Angeles.
This percentage does not seem likely to change anytime soon. According to Tim Brunold, USC’s director of admissions, about 55 percent of the applications received for next year’s freshmen class were from California applicants. That jump represents a 4 percent increase, slightly more than the 3 percent overall increase in applications.
A New York Times story on the analysis noted that USC is not the only school that might be slightly less national than it appears. At Harvard, the story said, more than one-third of the freshmen class come from within 200 miles of Cambridge, and about half of Boston University’s freshmen class come from within 200 miles of Boston.
Liz Warden contributed to this report.

In the college football world, the months of January and February are typically the time where young student athletes are put through various weight lifting and conditioning exercises as a way to remain in shape for the upcoming season.
For the past nine years, Chris Carlisle has led the young USC Trojans through these grueling offseason works, but with new head coach Lane Kiffin taking over for the NFL-bound Pete Carroll, Carlisle looks to be headed for the professional ranks as well.
On Monday, the USC Ripsit Blog announced that the 47-year old strength and conditioning coach had resigned from his post at USC to take a similar position with the Seattle Seahawks.
In the wake of his departure, there have been numerous posts across message boards reminiscing over the hard work and effort Carlisle had invested in the USC program. For the better part of the decade, Carlisle helped construct one of the most successful strength and condition programs in the country.
Following the 2006 season, he was rewarded for his efforts, as the Professional Football Strength and Conditioning Coaches Society named him the National Collegiate Strength and Conditioning Coach-of-the-Year. In short, he bears a lot of the responsibility for the success Carroll’s teams experienced over the past decade.
Long-time assistant strength and condition coach Jamie Yanchar, who has been a part of the Trojans’ staff since 1990, will serve in Carlisle’s role on an interim basis, as Kiffin begins to search for a full-time strength and condition coach.
