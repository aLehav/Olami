The Trojan Family is one that spans beyond the perimeter of USC’s beloved campus. No matter where you are, if you spot someone sporting USC gear, you are almost contractually obligated to throw up a “Fight On!” sign.
This weekend, current students invite their relatives to join in on what it means to belong to this network of passionate, skilled and loyal individuals. Beginning Thursday, Trojan Family Weekend will be packed with academic and extracurricular events for students’ families to experience. The official parent welcome will begin at 8 a.m. on Thursday at Alumni Park.
Thursday’s schedule focuses on the holistic campus experience highlighting safety, inclusion and student resources offered by the University.  The Admission Center will reacquaint visitors  with all the landmarks and construction projects through campus tours. Following the tour, families are encouraged to stop by the Trojan Farmers Market to grab a sweet afternoon treat. Thursday’s schedule also includes a University Convergence Panel Discussion with Provost Michael Quick, tours of the new USC Village and a welcome reception in Alumni Park. The evening will close with a performance by the B-52’s, hosted by Visions & Voices.
The weekend’s events will continue on Friday with individual receptions for each school. They are specifically geared toward offering parents a mid-semester evaluation of what the current academic year has been like for students both academically and personally. President C. L. Max Nikias will then give an address to all visiting family members from 10:30 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. in Bovard Auditorium.
The afternoon will continue with tours of Doheny Memorial Library and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, led by USC’s faculty and students. The night will end with a showcase performance featuring second-year music students at Ground Zero Performance Café.
The display of Trojan pride will culminate at Saturday’s football game, as the Trojans prepare to battle the Utah Utes. The Trojan Family Weekend Tailgate will begin at Alumni Park at 1:30 p.m. Families are greeted with an all-you-can-eat buffet, games, music and other pre-game festivities. The Trojan Marching Band and spirit leaders, will lead the way to the Coliseum, where the game will kick off at 5 p.m.
Trojan Family Weekend will close with Sunday events at the United University Church and the USC Caruso Catholic Center. A number of masses and blessings will be held from 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Families are also invited to cheer on the  women’s volleyball team in its afternoon match against Pac-12 rival Stanford  at the Galen Center.

As the old cliche goes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As a second-generation Chinese American, I was raised at the intersection of two equally intricate and wildly different worlds — the East and the West — and I grappled with perceptions of my own beauty, depending on which world was beholding it.
During my most formative teenage years, I struggled to understand how I fit into narratives constructed by both sides of my identity. My almond eyes and slight double lids were considered wide and endearing by the East but deemed squinty and comical by the West. At 5-foot-4, my stature was average in the West but too tall to be labeled petite and desirable by the East. My cousin lusted after my sharp chin while my aunt criticized my tan skin. I was tiny and big-boned, too yellow and too brown, ugly and beautiful.
Beauty ideals are sure to be distinct according to culture and nationality but reconciling these disparities has proven to be a daunting process. Take the meaning of light skin tone, for example. In Chinese society, paler skin has long been deemed a more desirable trait than tan skin because of its association with high status. Upper class people would not have to perform manual labor in the hot sun and cultivated a class difference based on fairer skin. This standard only metastasized post colonialism, as Western ideals of pale skin, light hair and slim faces were glamorized in tangent with Western capitalism and culture.
Today, plastic surgery has surged in East Asia, with young women routinely altering their appearances to attain heightened nose bridges, lighter hair and double eyelids, all in an effort to conform to standards borne from and idealized by the West.
I know that body image isn’t an issue specific to Asians, but being a minority in America made me more critical about my own image. Growing up, I rarely saw women who looked like me on TV or in magazines. Instead, I was sold an airbrushed image of white perfection — long legs, tiny waist, peach skin, blue eyes — that was unattainable for my genetics.
If I ever did see an Asian woman in media, she represented a further paradox in that she was always the height of Asian beauty, often hypersexualized or exploited for her cultural exoticism. There are roles for white actors of all shapes, sizes, ages and creeds. But within the Asian American community, only the best of us, the most physically ideal, are chosen for rare roles — roles often intent on homogenizing and sexualizing Asian women or roles that only exist so the network can boast diversity. In Hollywood, there’s no room for average-looking minorities.
The homogenization of Asian women also created a palpable pressure to “blend in” by appearing less Asian because ethnic features were correlated with archetypal traits and demeaning portrayals. The skewed and blatantly inaccurate representation of Asians my entire childhood perpetuated false notions that if I couldn’t look white and had to look Asian, I had to be the perfect Asian.
And collectively, these pressures take a toll on Asian American women in particular. The American Psychological Association and the National Alliance on Mental Health found that U.S.-born Asian American women between the ages of 15 and 24 exhibit higher rates of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts than the national average, including white women. The International Journal of Eating Disorders also established that young Asian Americans are acutely prone to eating disorders, a phenomenon stemming from pressures to conform to the model minority label and idealized beauty images.
Four years ago, I was an unknowing 15-year-old victim to this subjugating cultural agenda; I counted calories religiously, agonized over every physical flaw and measured my own beauty against a ridiculous (not to mention, impossible) standard that was all I knew. Since my partial emergence from the chrysalis of insecurity, my self-perception has evolved past that which was spoon-fed to me by the media culture I was born into.
There are still tremendous strides to be taken in combatting Asian American body image issues that start and end with the media’s acceptance of different types of beauty and willingness to perpetuate representative images of minorities. Beauty can wear more than one face — but only if millions of beholders make it known.
Catherine Yang is a sophomore majoring in communication. She is also the lifestyle editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Catharsis,” runs every other Wednesday.
I have a great respect for the feelings of people. I am in the beauty business more than 50 year and I never—ever—discourage any girl to become a model, regardless their biotype or looks. Note: Some visibly did not had a chance, however nobody knows the future, maybe the girl can change their looks by loosing (or gaining) weight, have a plastic surgery, etc…
If any of us look into a mirror long enough we will find something to complain about.  Glob onto another issue if you feel compelled to join the gaggle of malcontents.  Surely there is an app out there to accommodate you.
I think the point that Catherine is making is that being torn apart by the beauty standards of two different countries makes it difficult to understand one’s own perception of beauty. Yes, everyone has something to complain about but that’s not what she’s saying. With her being the lifestyle editor of the Daily Trojan and her experience with writing about topics similar to these in general, it is unfair to say that ‘there is an app out there to accommodate (her)’. At no point in her article is she complaining about her image, she is merely describing a situation that most Asian American children face during their growing years. It’s sad that you missed her main point and made her sound as if she has a self image problem, when the real problem may just be ignorance, similar to yours, about the issue.
You are sorely mistaken.  The thrust of her article was not missed, but rather dismissed. The matter is settled.
Thats really worrying. But each to their own.
Sad to say, Catherine’s description of this self-image problem are unfortunate, and damaging to millions of girls and women.  Sadder yet; however, is the impossibility of her desired action happening:
“. . .combatting Asian American body image issues . . . start and end with the media’s acceptance of different types of beauty and willingness to perpetuate representative images of minorities.” 
“. . . start and end with the media’s acceptance.” Who can induce the media to accept varied types of beauty? The collective media is under no one’s central management. The media will print, display and broadcast as beautiful whatever the individual editors and producers want. And “willingness to perpetuate representative images of minorities?” What are these representative images? Who supplies them for this perpetuation?
Looking at Catherine’s photo, she seems glum, but she has a cute face and gorgeous, long brown hair. One can only hope that she realizes her image is a nice one. A nice smile is all she needs for that photo.
Few of us look as gorgeous as models or movie stars, men or women. It is up to the individual person to foster their own health and grooming, and to take satisfaction that they have done their best for good appearance. More important, the individual needs to take steps to be a kind, listening, supportive and upbeat person. That will provide the greatest appeal of all, countering one’s inability to become model/movie star gorgeous.

Bret Stephens, the famous conservative Wall Street Journal turned New York Times columnist, came out in favor of a constitutional repeal of the Second Amendment last week, in response to the slaughter in Las Vegas. I admire him for his pugnacity and countercultural willingness to break with his readership on such an important issue, and generally agree with him and the American left that some degree of gun control, including certain confiscations and certain bans, is good policy. But I remain unconvinced that gun control is the panacea the American left believes it could and will be, or that it is the only way to reduce the rising death tolls from mass shootings.
To be perfectly clear — I don’t oppose gun control. I do support particular gun control policies. I just don’t think it’s the entirety of the solution to the problems of domestic terrorism and mass murder that increasingly plague America.
To begin, few among our generation are aware, but the late 1960s and early 1970s were far, far more violent than the mid-to-late 2010s have been thus far. High-profile assassinations, thousands of small terrorist bombings a year, lynchings by white supremacists and skyjackings in any number of terrorist or criminal groups composed the reality of an America embroiled by urban decay, the Vietnam War and the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.
Yet by Gerald Ford’s accession to the presidency in 1974, the bombings and skyjackings and lynchings and assassinations had ceased. Americans were as troubled as ever by distrust in government and the looming energy crisis, but they had stopped killing each other in the streets for the time being.
Why is this relevant? Because of the attitude toward resolving that great social and cultural crisis the government took. We couldn’t just ban bomb-making materials — those were illegal already, and in any case the violence took other forms. On top of pushing a campaign of law and order and speaking the language of the “Moral Majority,” then-President Richard Nixon addressed what were perceived to be the root causes of the social unrest sweeping through America — continued involvement in the Vietnam War and the various social problems afflicting the American poor. Over the course of his presidency, the United States drew down its commitment in Vietnam and ended the military draft, and unleashed a flood of domestic legislation — school desegregation, welfare reform, revenue sharing and new regulatory agencies— aimed at improving domestic conditions. And by the time Nixon resigned in disgrace over the Watergate scandal, the bombings and skyjackings and even the mass protests and street violence had ceased. The frequent violence of the prior decade was over.
In the late 2010s, again in an era of dramatic divisions, rising tensions and all-too-frequent political and apolitical violence, we face a different situation: There isn’t one or two political factors leading to the cultural breakdown and social isolation whose ultimate manifestations are the mass shootings, the car and truck attacks, the low-level public knifings that no longer surprise anyone when they happen. But despite the lack of a proximate cause to address, the social breakdown is no less real, depicted vividly by writers on the right and left and occasionally addressed by policy wonks intent on crafting policies that build “social capital.” The problem is, as many point out, no one really knows how.
We need to figure out how, and at levels beyond just policy. Every level of American society, from governments to communities to businesses to churches to foundations, needs to be somehow involved in the great work of putting our social fabric back on a course toward order and stability and harmony. And that requires national leadership of a caliber we haven’t had in decades, but that we’ll need again soon.
To reiterate, gun control is just good policy and good management, and really should be done sooner rather than later in the interests of the public, gun owners and everyone else involved. I’m happy my party — the Republican Party — is starting to realize that and is making, at the very least, baby steps toward pragmatism in that regard.
But I remain skeptical that gun control, no matter how comprehensive and well-intentioned and well-enforced, will put a halt to the cycle of social violence that’s begun to envelop the country in recent years. Madmen and terrorists always seem to find a way. America’s gone crazy; in the short run, making America sane again could involve passing new gun laws and bans and regulations. But in the long run, it must involve so much more.
Luke Phillips is a senior majoring in policy, planning and development. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Wednesdays.
Democrats:  Ban all guns immediately!Republicans, as represented by the erstwhile young Phillips:  OK, OK, can we just ban most of those bad awful guns for now and worry about the rest later, like after the next election cycle.  And can you please throw us a bone on “the cycle of social violence that’s begun to envelop the country”.Democrats:  Duh what?Phillips:  Just think of something.  Maybe a study or a select committee.Democrats:  Sure no prob.  Great working with ya.  When can we get started on banning speech we disagree with?
Disagree on the gun control stance, agree that a major key to reducing much of the violence is increased social connection and decreased social conflict.
Add some mental health awareness and care, and you’ll probably get a lot farther than anything any gun control might ever do.
One component, I think, has to be a return toward a republic rather than a centralized democracy for handling many social policies.  For example, on many social policies, the centralized push using the Federal level practically guarantees a large minority or even a majority (in some cases) will be dissatisfied with the outcome and increase social conflict.
By returning to the ability to set major social policies by state governments and ensure the ability for people to move freely between states, the potential is to reduce social conflict by allowing populations to set their own laws based on their own social values locally.  In turn, dissatisfied people have the ability to move somewhere else where people think more like themselves.

In the journalism world, writing about a shooting — whether it be the very real, massive and tragic massacre in Las Vegas last Sunday or the campus shooter scare at USC last Monday — a week after it has occurred is old news.
But it shouldn’t be. The Las Vegas shooting, which killed 58 people, comes off the heels of the Orlando shooting at the Pulse nightclub, which killed 49 people, which came after the San Bernardino shooting, which killed 14 people. And that closely follows shootings at Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech. The list goes on and on.
Yet, as gun violence has become normalized — the Las Vegas shooting was the 273rd mass shooting, or incident involving multiple victims of firearm violence, in America in 2017 — the reaction on campus last week shows that the fear that gun violence instills, whether the threat is tangible or not, is more real and horrible than ever. During the shooting scare, the Daily Trojan reported that junior Remy Porsella said he heard screaming and saw hundreds of people running out the doors of Fertitta Hall. What he said was telling: “It was full panic.”
But as students reel from last week’s events — and chaotic national and world events in, for example, Las Vegas, Puerto Rico and North Korea — it is crucial that they turn fear into meaningful action. It is so easy to be consumed by the helplessness that follows a mass tragedy. It is much more courageous to channel our energy into productive action.
USC does not institute active shooter training, so we don’t know how to react to an active shooter situation, contributing to the mass panic of last Monday. That creates a compelling impetus for students to advocate for the administration to implement active shooter training. Campus buildings have periodic fire evacuation drills, and USC participates annually in The Great ShakeOut drill to prepare for a large-scale earthquake. Mass shootings on college campuses have occurred regularly enough to merit a similar kind of disaster preparedness.
On a larger scale, we can begin building the foundation for meaningful gun reform. Students with gun control-opposing representatives: It’s time to apply pressure. Call your representatives, post on social media, pitch to media organizations — so that we, collectively, keep gun control at the forefront of the public conscience. Most importantly, everyone needs to vote in local elections to ensure that reform can begin on the smallest scale and move upward.
It’s a time of crisis for progressive college students across America, whose formative years were shaped by the promises of hope and change made by former President Barack Obama. It feels so slow and so sad: Many of us thought the massacre of elementary-school children in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 had to spur substantial gun control legislation. But we are short-sighted; we fail to see that we are a small part of a much larger, much longer movement, and it is up to us to ensure its sustainability.
So now is not the time to give up. This is not just a test of our willpower. This is the test of our collective heart. If we can’t even begin to believe that we can do better, we will never improve the world we live in, and we will never make the necessary sacrifices to make our children’s world better than our own. Now is the time for tenacious, courageous leadership.
There are tens of thousands of students on this campus that care deeply about preventing gun violence and mass shootings. We are not going to be intimidated and rendered helpless on our own campus. The world may be spinning out of control, but there are some things that we can control. Let’s make our democracy work.
And let’s raise hell.
Sonali Seth is a senior majoring in policy, planning and development. She is also the special projects editor of the Daily Trojan. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Wednesdays.
We have plenty of gun control laws in this country that criminals, by their very nature, ignore.  How is adding another law to the books going to prevent criminals from breaking the law?  What you are seeking is for people to stop killing people.  If you figure that one out, I’ll nominate you for a Nobel Peace Prize.  Heck, I’ll give you Obama’s.

 In their first episode collaborating with the Daily Trojan, Buck Andrews and Sarah Kassel throw it back to 2013, when Obama was still in office, they were still in high school and Britney Spears released her worst-selling album of all time: Britney Jean. This episode was taped live and not in front of a studio audience. In this episode Buck and Kassel discuss 2 songs off Britney’s most interesting album: “Chillin With You” and “Perfume.” They discover that Britney’s deepest desire is to be cryogenically frozen alongside her iconic sibling Jamie Lynn and that the Disney classic “Frozen” was actually based off this desire. Bear with them.

Dear Hecuba,
I recently discovered that my friend doesn’t follow me back on Instagram. Okay, I checked because I was suspicious, but I was right! Should I confront him? We’re on good terms and talk regularly (and not because we’re being forced to); I have no idea why he would be mad at me!
— No Likes in Lyon Center
Dear No Likes,
This is a tough situation and I can understand why you’re fretting. Feeling snubbed is never fun!
There are many possible explanations to this — one of which you have mentioned. It is quite possible you may have inadvertently offended them at some point and, resultantly, they have banished you from their Instagram feed. However, the fact that you’re still in touch leads me to think this may not be the case.
Another possible explanation is that they could be a social media novice who is merely unaware that you have an account and would be happy to follow you back if it was brought to their attention. To subtly remind them of your existence, DM them something funny that you saw on Instagram that is relevant to any of your recent discussions or reply to their Instagram story with a quick ? or ? if appropriate.
If neither of those tactics work, unfortunately, I do have some bad news for you. It is possible (and not unlikely) that your friend may not follow you back on Instagram because they simply don’t care about or don’t enjoy your ContentTM.
“But Hecuba! I have fantastic posts!”
NL, the truth is hard, but your friend may have Marie Kondo’d his Instagram feed and your avocado toast might have looked too staged (or not staged enough) for his tastes and you didn’t make the cut. This is somewhat brutal of them, but sometimes it can feel like the world could end any second, so not wanting to waste any time with Instagram accounts that don’t inspire joy is somewhat understandable, too.
If this is the case, you could certainly put them on the spot and call them out, but a follower forced is not a follower earned! Alternatively, you could just unfollow them, if the imbalance so bothered you.
And in terms of friendship, I suggest pondering if mutual following on Instagram is a requisite or not. It sounds like your relationship otherwise is copacetic and it would be a shame to lose an analog friend over a digital profile.

It took 15 seconds for the top-ranked men’s water polo team to take control in Sunday’s 6-3 win over No. 8 UC Santa Barbara. Senior 2-meter Lachlan Edwards put USC on the board early in the first quarter with an assist by freshman driver Marko Vavic. Senior driver Matteo Morelli scored to increase the Trojans’ lead to 2-0 to end the quarter.
“We focused really hard on playing good defense today, and we did: We only allowed one goal until the last few minutes of the game,” Morelli said. “Personally, I was focused on trying to make the least amount of mistakes, and even if I made mistakes, to have a quick memory and focus on the next play.”
Senior utility James Walters and senior driver Blake Edwards each added on goals before UCSB freshman driver Tommy Fellner put the Gauchos on the board with 5:59 left in the second quarter. Edwards scored again, and the Trojans entered halftime with a 5-1 lead.
Both teams were held scoreless in the third. Lachlan Edwards broke the scoreless run with 5:16 left in the game, and UCSB scored two goals in the last minutes of the fourth quarter, ending the game 6-3.
“We didn’t really do a good job on offense — we missed easy opportunities,” Morelli said. “We were able to win the game, but when we play harder teams, we have to focus on making those easy opportunities.”
Senior goalie McQuin Baron, who won his second MPSF Player of the Week award of the season on Monday, tallied 14 saves for the Trojans in the victory. Blake Edwards led the team in scoring with his two goals. Edwards and sophomore driver Thomas Dunstan tied for most assists for the Trojans, each tallying two.
After a busy early season, the Trojans have some time off. On Saturday, they will play Trojan alumni in the USC Water Polo Alumni Game.
“It’s always fun seeing all those guys that have won a lot and have fun with them,” Morelli said. “We always take it as a serious game, but it’s an opportunity [to learn].”
USC’s next test will be at home against UC Irvine on Oct. 21. The Trojans will play the Anteaters for the second time this fall after facing them in the quarterfinal of the Mountain Pacific Invitational last month — when USC edged UC Irvine in a 10-9 nailbiter at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. After that, the team looks forward to its final five regular season matches before heading toward the postseason.
“I think our main goal is to be ranked No. 1 going into the MPSF tournament and ranked No. 1 going into the NCAA tournament,” Morelli said. “And obviously, the final goal is to win it all.”

When the Los Angeles Rams opened the 2017 regular season with a convincing 46-9 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, there was a positive feeling about the direction that the team was heading in. Los Angeles put on a dominant defensive showing in its Week 1 victory, paired with a clean 300-yard passing effort from quarterback Jared Goff. The Sean McVay coaching era began with a win.
But following the victory, as the media gaggle made its way to the Rams’ locker room, I heard several reporters muttering, “Don’t drink the Rams’ Kool-Aid just yet … let’s see where this team is in a few weeks.”
These media members had reason to express caution. After watching the Rams begin 3-1 and ultimately tailspin to a 4-12 record last season, anyone around this franchise should be wary of a meltdown.
But for followers of the Rams, something is distinctly different about the team this go-around. Something about this group feels more absolute — more concrete. Maybe it’s the youthful spark of 31-year-old head coach McVay that has people buying in. It could be a blossoming Goff, or resurgent running back Todd Gurley that has people feeling like Los Angeles has finally harnessed the talent of its young football stars.
And while the Rams are coming off an exhausting 16-10 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, I find myself now, more than ever, saying this team will be formidable in the NFC this season. Dare I say, this team will be vying for a playoff spot come winter.
The loss certainly hurt, but with 11 games remaining, the upside for McVay’s Rams is something NFL fans should take note of.
Despite serving up five turnovers to the Seahawks (who rank fifth in total defense), the Rams still had every opportunity to come away with a win on its home turf. The fact that the Rams could have escaped Sunday with a win is a testament to the team’s resilience this season.
I hate spewing coach-speak in my columns, but the Rams’ loss on Sunday came down to a game of inches. If Gurley’s first-quarter fumble didn’t hit the pylon or if wide receiver Cooper Kupp was able to reel in the game-winning touchdown pass that fell off his fingertips with less than 30 seconds left in play, Los Angeles would be a 4-1 football team today. It would be tied (with three other teams) for the second-best record in football through five weeks.
Nonetheless, the Rams find themselves sitting at 3-2 overall through five games. In a very-winnable NFC West, Los Angeles finds itself in second place.
The Rams’ strong showings early on have been powered by an offensive attack that, following Week 4, was statistically the best offense in the NFL. After Sunday’s game, Los Angeles now bears the second-best scoring offense in the game, averaging 30.4 points per game.
In stark contrast, the 2016 Rams’ attack finished last in the NFL. The team’s offensive resurrection certainly has to be largely credited to McVay, who was a proven offensive mind during his time coaching in Washington the past seven seasons. The guru McVay has helped some assets finally blossom for the Rams.
Gurley’s outstanding September saw him bring home NFC Offensive Player of the Month honors. After a sluggish 2016 season, Gurley racked up 381 yards from scrimmage (241 rushing, 140 receiving) and scored six total touchdowns (four rushing, two receiving) in his first four games.
At signal caller, Goff has had shining moments through the first five contests of 2017. In the Rams’
35-30 victory on the road against the Dallas Cowboys, Goff threw for 255 yards and a pair of touchdowns in what was Los Angeles’ biggest win of the young season.
In Sunday’s contest against the Seahawks, Tavon Austin found the endzone on a 27-yard rushing score that was the Rams’ only touchdown of the day.
This trio of Goff, Gurley and Austin is a young nucleus that the Rams are glad to see being productive thus far in 2017. And while the Rams’ defense has been underachieving in many aspects, ranking 23rd in scoring defense (allowing 24.2 points per game), it held Seattle to 62 total rushing yards Sunday. This defense also boasts what many consider to be the most dominant defensive player in the NFL in lineman Aaron Donald.
So, my conclusion? After just five games, I feel comfortable stating that the Rams have the tools (a budding quarterback, a defensive star and a young, offensive-minded coach) to build a winning season and make a playoff push.
But first things first for
fresh-faced coach McVay (who has two players on his roster who are older than him): His team has an opportunity to make a statement on the road next week against a thriving Jacksonville (3-2) team that is leading the AFC South.
As for the question posed following Week 1: Yes, I am in fact drinking the Rams’ Kool-Aid. Hopefully not prematurely.

The women’s soccer team concluded its two-game road trip to Arizona on Sunday with a match against Arizona State. After a heart-stopping double-overtime victory over Arizona on Thursday, the No. 6 Women of Troy kept it rolling in Tempe three days later — topping the Sun Devils 2-1 in a come-from-behind victory.
Despite the Trojans’ momentum heading into the match, their first-half performance was lackluster at times, and Arizona State capitalized to grab an early lead with a goal in the 10th minute. USC then dug itself into a deeper hole just before halftime when redshirt senior defender Dominique Randle was shown a red card in the 44th minute.
Head coach Keidane McAlpine’s squad went into the locker room down both a player and a goal, setting up an uphill battle for USC in the second half — the team had tallied just two shots compared to ASU’s nine.
But as they have done many times this season, the Women of Troy regrouped at halftime and came out flying in the second period. They received a boost in the 61st minute, when ASU junior defender Angela Boyle was sent off. The foul evened things up in more ways than one: First, the two teams’ offsetting red cards equalized the number of players on the field for each side, but more importantly, it granted a free kick for freshman forward Tara McKeown.
From the top of the 18-yard box, McKeown curved the ball around the wall and into the far bottom corner. The goal tied the score at 1 and was the fourth score of McKeown’s career in Cardinal and Gold.
USC struck again just 12 minutes later to complete the turnaround — this time from open play. Threatening deep in the ASU defensive zone, the Women of Troy strung together four key passes to steal the lead. Sophomore midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre played an arcing cross off the head of senior midfielder Nicole Molen. Junior forward Hailey Hite was in position to receive Molen’s flick on, and Hite delivered a pass to redshirt senior Amanda Rooney. Rooney finished the play with a magnificent
one-touch shot, placed just below the crossbar to grant USC a 2-1 lead.
Time expired before the Sun Devils could answer, as redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins and the Trojan defense held firm in the final moments. Collins tallied eight saves on the day, doubling her previous career high. The win improved USC’s overall record to 10-1-1 and raised its conference mark to 4-0-1.
The game against Arizona State marked the Trojans’ fifth come-from-behind victory this season, meaning that half of their wins have been in comeback fashion. While USC’s ability to bounce back from a lax first half has been impressive, the team will have to play with its second-half intensity throughout the entire match if it wants to be competitive with top-tier programs, and the Women of Troy have yet to play a team ranked in the current top 25 this season.
Nevertheless, with a 10-1-1 record, USC are in the midst of its best start to a season since 2008 (12-1-1). The Women of Troy’s next test comes Friday, when they will return to McAlister Field to host Colorado.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
USC was met with criticism from the Greek community last week after the administration announced new GPA and unit requirements for Greek recruitment. According to the new policy, freshmen will be barred from joining a fraternity or sorority until they have completed 12 units at USC and established a GPA of 2.5 or above. As Ainsley Carry, the vice president for Student Affairs and a major proponent of the policy, said in a memo, students should have a chance to “acclimate to the University’s academic and social climate before participating in Greek-letter organizations.”
Organizations including the Interfraternerity Council denounced the new restrictions, arguing that freshmen should have the freedom to join any organization at USC. And this is certainly true — first-semester freshmen are open to join organizations such as athletic teams and the marching band, both of which are notorious for their demanding schedules and time commitments. But USC’s decision is less about two-dimensional factors such as time commitment as it is about the negative aspects of Greek life and the culture it can perpetuate. The administration’s decision begs the question of how beneficial Greek life is to new students’ overall well-being.
While only about a quarter of students at USC are involved in Greek life, it is an omnipresent on campus. Whether it be sorority girls sporting backpacks and clothing with their letters or freshman pledges donning suits on Mondays, there is a clear and tangible distance between those that are a part of Greek life and those that are not. This distance and exclusivity creates almost an ingroup and outgroup dynamic on campus. To an incoming freshman with the means to join, Greek life might seem like the most obvious and desirable way to make friends on campus and they might become part of the ingroup; this might prevent students from taking the time to adjust to the demands of school and find organizations that are a better fit for them.
Not only is the Greek system exclusive as a whole, but it is also hierarchical within the same bubble. Houses are generally ranked on a scale with those that comprise the wealthiest and most conventionally attractive people landing in the top houses. This creates an environment of competition and judgment on the Row, one that is not beneficial to the self-esteem of new students. Sororities, especially, are known for their hyper-judgmental recruitment processes, in which members meet prospective new members and decide whether to give them offers. This is certainly not beneficial for the mental health of students, especially those who are new to the school and community and have yet to develop a support system of friends and mentors to fall back on.
Aside from the potential to affect the confidence and self-worth of students, one of USC’s biggest qualms with Greek culture is the issue of binge-drinking. Students are most prone to hurting themselves because of drinking during the first few weeks and months of college, according to a 2013 study by the American Psychological Association. It is Carry’s view and that of many others who were in support of limiting Greek life at USC that despite USC’s policies against underage drinking, it is almost inevitable that students will engage in it. However, the pledging process is a time in which new students are highly encouraged and pressured to drink large amounts of alcohol, and are given an off-campus space to do so. This combination puts pressure on students’ academics as well as their general well-being during their first semester.
Being given a semester to adjust is not something to put up a fight about — new students should be able to take the time to figure out their academic, social and personal priorities during their college experience without pressure to be a part of the “ingroup.” In many cases, the friends they meet outside of Greek life during this first semester may give students the network and support system that they otherwise would have sought in joining the Greek community.
Academically speaking, Carry’s implementation of the GPA requirement actually places due emphasis on upholding academic standards with regard to Greek life. While this is somewhat of a disruption to the long-standing tradition of Greek life at USC, Carry’s new policies are beneficial. Having a semester to adjust and focus on oneself without the social pressures of the recruitment process further emphasizes the importance of new students’ overall well-being.
If deferring first semester recruitment will have such a profound effect on the 25% of USC’s student population participating in Greek life, why not defer recruitment for ALL student activities like Athletics, Marching Band, Clubs, even the Daily Trojan?  Are those students not worthy of the protections and benefits this edict will afford?  To target Greeks exclusively is blatantly discriminating against a class of students that, while not perfect, have a long tradition of positively contributing to USC’s thriving academic environment and endowment.  Dr. Carry’s policy is ill advised and does not benefit the well being of all Freshmen.  It is a divisive, illogical Band-aid that will animate and alienate a powerful student and alumni community.  The solution is not to divide, it is to focus on constructive mental health, alcohol awareness and sexual harassment programs that will truly benefit all Freshmen.  Fraternities and Sororities are the perfect delivery vehicle for such progams, at least for 25% of the USC student population.  What say you Dr. Carry for the other 75%?

Last week was Mental Illness Awareness Week, which surprised me. It was the first time I had heard of such a thing, even as someone who has recently been taking time to actively focus on mental health. There are a handful of awareness months dedicated to similar causes, which admirably acknowledges mental health awareness as something that deserves perennial attention. For the first time, I feel strong enough to shed light on a topic that I’ve long struggled with discussing: my own struggles with anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and how these issues tie into every aspect of my life — even and especially my creativity and ambition.
What I cannot avoid is that I live with OCD every day. What I cannot avoid is that I am an artist — a student studying screenwriting at the School of Cinematic Arts — who constantly thinks about how to spend her career creating and advocating for diverse content on television. And by diversity, I don’t mean only race — I mean diversity that hinges on intersectionality and depends on portraying people of color whose experiences are not exclusive to representing people of their race. And where the portrayal of mental illness is concerned, there is a visible paucity of characters of color whose stories explore and find the humanity in issues that white characters are afforded.
When researching which popular television shows depict mental health in their characters in powerful ways, familiar titles popped up for me: the United States of Tara and its exploration of a mom with various personalities, Shameless and bipolar disorder, Bojack Horseman and depression. (Interestingly, the latter stars — of all things — a horse.) These titles are among a longer list of shows that have broken ground with the way we talk about and empathize with mentally ill people, and the way we mine the depths of their humanity via emotional struggle.
Clearly, whether shows explore mental health accurately is an entirely different matter, crucial unto itself. But what is unclear to me is why progress still lags in the arena of portraying mental health onscreen. I wonder why mentally ill characters are still so vastly white, why we are conditioned to imagine depression first in terms of a horse before an underrepresented human being. In the way of counterarguments, there are several I can already predict: It’s hard enough to tell stories about minorities and mental illness, so who can be expected to do both; that maybe it’s not an empowering representation for diverse viewers; or that it just doesn’t matter. And yet, it matters so much. Denying diversity an opportunity to explore mental health goes hand in hand with creating complicated, flawed, powerful characters in one group of people but rarely others, and — in the grander scheme of things — selectively choosing to view the humanity and individuality in one group of people, but rarely in others.
On a personal note, I knew I loved writing before I even knew that a job like screenwriting existed.My earlier forays into literature were in the genres of poetry, short stories, a stage play. But I was never able to write about myself, and I still find it difficult to. When I tried, I felt this strange, intense shame — the feeling that there was nothing in me worth examining or worth being listened to, mixed with the idea that no one wanted to listen to my experiences, anyway.  My earlier stories starred white, male protagonists because that was what I was used to seeing and what I knew how to emulate. Through high school, as my anxiety grew a life of its own, it felt like my anxiety and OCD existed somewhere between who I was and how I wanted the world to see me, trapped in a way that felt like I would always be watching myself suffer.
My fear, in not recognizing my own mental health issues, stemmed not from the fear that people wouldn’t believe me, but the idea that I wouldn’t let myself think about it. I attributed my OCD to a burgeoning need for perfection and a constantly fearful worry over the future, and I decided that it was who I was and always would be. I decided that maybe it was because I was Asian American, a high achiever like everyone perceived me, even though my parents never pushed me academically beyond anything they thought I couldn’t do. What’s darkly interesting is that I didn’t grow up in a space that stressed me out or made me believe life had to be perfect — and yet, I was still willing, even sometimes today, to think about my OCD in terms of the stereotypes that have always been thrust upon me by who else, but films, TV shows and the people who believe in them.
I take it as a sign that I didn’t start effective and long-lasting treatment for OCD until I moved to California for college, where for the first time I could walk down a street without feeling like I was wearing my race on my shoulders. It took me this long to fully explore my own voice in my writing, from my own heart. And what I’ve always believed, from the moment I set my sights on a career in film and television, is that every person in the world deserves to feel like they belong. I always say that proper representation in the media allows people to see others more clearly; but it allows us to see ourselves better, too.

I understand the final sentence of your article, but I cannot envision how this proper representation could be implemented. How would that happen? No criticism, just don’t understand how that could be done.

If you arrive at the Santa Monica Pier early enough on a Saturday morning, you can hear a violinist you’d swear was Juilliard-trained playing as the first fishing lines are cast into the vast ocean — the all-consuming smell of salt and fresh fish wafting into the cool Los Angeles air before dawn.
If you hit the classic spots — the Pier, Third Street Promenade, “ShoreBar” — at the right, off-peak times, you may be pleasantly surprised by the lack of people, but it’s the off-the-beaten-path treasures that will really catch your eye and capture your heart.
In its purest elemental form, Santa Monica is still a small beach town. Under the guise of tourist attractions and fancy finger foods, you can still find the crux and core of the city. The first non-indigenous explorer to set foot in this beautiful area was Gaspar de Portola, who set up camp at what is now the intersection of Barrington and Ohio avenues. After the monumental Mexican-American War, U.S. government sovereignty in California officially began on Feb. 2, 1848. Once the new railroad connected Santa Monica to Los Angeles in the 1870s, the city boomed.
Today, long-established shops and new pop-ups alike line this Western beachfront city.

Check out the Santa Monica Rings at any of the small beaches that line the California coast.  Even if you’re not a Cirque du Soleil performer, give it a shot or just watch in amazement as  a modern-day Jeff Spicolis wows you.  Don’t miss the spectacular sunsets from the cliffs in Palisades Park.
Stop at Chez Jay, a Santa Monica institution.  From the old neon sign to the peanut shells underfoot, this no-frills landmark has been around for 50 years. You’ll get a quick breather from your classic bougie bars and star-studded L.A. clubs.
Want to go back further in time? How about a bite at Snug Harbor? With great pancakes and omelettes, it’s been in the same spot since World War II. It’s a splendid, little-known diner that stays hidden next to the hype of the famous Bru’s Wiffle.
Thirsty for something stronger than lemonade?  Pop into the Speak Easy or JP’s. They’re as divey as dive bars come, but friendlier than Cheers and you can definitely “come as you are.”  No shoes, no shirt, no problem! Pop on by after a day at the beach.

If you need to burn some calories, you can run or bike on The Strand for absolutely stunning views of the Pacific all the way down to the Malibu coastline.
It’s a postcard come to life.
Next time you’re in the famous city of Santa Monica, try something new. Take an insider’s glance. You’ll be surprised at the sweet, little niches of culture and diversity you can find in the nooks and crannies of the city.

From the wood paneling to the throw pillows splattered with palm frond designs, Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop embodies an urbanized “rustic chic” feel. Strategically placed potted plants, mosaic tiling and a shelf of kale and arugula add to its aesthetic. The restaurant aims to provide diners with farm-to-table options using fresh ingredients, hearty recipes and gourmet cooking. Since opening on Sept. 29 in USC Village, Greenleaf has promoted community dining and a new take on the healthy marketplace.
From dishes such as the baked “spaghetti” with Tuscan kale salad featuring spaghetti squash, to the Trojan Bowl loaded with quinoa or farro and mixed with avocado, black beans, tomatoes, corn and kale and drizzled with nacho cheese sauce, visitors have plenty of robust options to choose from. Its menu boasts an array of entrees, salads, brunch options, cold-pressed juices, protein shakes and more. Admittedly, the extensive list may be intimidating to first-time guests, but the friendly and attentive staff is more than willing to assist in recommending fan favorites. Guests can order at the counter from the menu at the front and choose to dine indoors and enjoy the lively ambience, outdoors for a more laid-back feel or to-go for those with busy schedules. Greenleaf’s trendy space also offers wine and beer with a bar situated in the center of the restaurant.
Its popular Greenplate Special comprises any half panini and a side — a foolproof option for those who can’t decide. A popular option is the pesto chicken panini and baked sweet potato fries with avocado pesto. The crunchiness of the toasted bread combined with the flavor of grilled tomatoes and basil vinaigrette perfectly complement each other. The avocado pesto balances out the sweetness of the fries, providing a healthier twist to the traditional French fries at other restaurants.

For frequent visitors, Greenleaf’s loyalty program features rewards for dining. With every 200 points accumulated, the program offers $10 off guests’ next purchase. The restaurant is also known for its catering services and online ordering for added convenience.
However, it is a bit on the pricier side. Diners can expect to pay anywhere between $11 and $20 for a dish, which might not be optimal for college students on a budget. In addition, service is not ideal for those who are looking to grab a quick bite in between lectures, with long lines and wait times that can exceed 15 minutes. The combination of high price points, slower service and smaller portion sizes may be a deterrent for broke, busy students, but the atmosphere provides a good place for a weekend splurge.
Bustling with energy, the atmosphere transforms into a refreshing space for groups to socialize and catch up. The restaurant is a neat place for students to take their parents who come to town for the weekend or a space to relax with friends for a reprieve from a hectic semester. For a “treat yourself” meal, Greenleaf provides health-conscious dishes for even the pickiest eaters.

Ancient lore states that there are two types of people in the world: Those who drink coffee and those who drink tea. Drinking tea, namely herbal tea, is known to have positive health effects and provides numerous natural remedies. Herbal teas do not usually contain caffeine and each provides  different benefits, such as better sleep, reduced inflammation, pain alleviation and immunity. If you are a tea drinker, here is a list of herbal teas to remedy the stresses of fall semester:
After checking grades on Blackboard
Try peppermint tea, which is good for easing nausea and vomiting.
After late nights in Leavey Library
Take a few sips of green tea — it’s known for counteracting stress on the brain.  On another note, studies have shown green tea could possibly reduce the risk of neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. It can also reduce the risk of a stroke and improve cholesterol levels. Drinking green tea with lemon and honey may also help with sore throats.
After eating Panda Express two days in a row
Make yourself a nice cup of fennel tea, which cleans out the kidneys and helps with clear skin. It’s also good for constipation.
After eating Panda Express three days in a row
Drinking hawthorn tea helps reduce high blood pressure and prevents clogged arteries.
The annual norovirus outbreak
Ginger tea is spectacular during the early stages of an infection. It is also good for pain relief.  With lemon and honey, ginger tea can also reduce stress, fight colds and reduce cramps.
After turning in a research paper   
Try lavender tea, made from the dried pink, purple and white flowers of the popular shrub.
Going to a school with over 40,000 people
Try thyme tea, which is one of the best treatments for colds. It contains volatile oils, which are extracted from  the plant and help protect against viruses and infections. It can also help with chest decongestion.
After  pulling  three all-nighters
The best sleep aid is chamomile tea, which contains tryptophan, an amino acid with tranquilizing effects. As a relaxant, it helps calm the mind, body and soul. It is also anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antibacterial.
After having a third cup of coffee
For those who drink both coffee and tea, cardamom tea can detoxify caffeine from the body.
Before an interview 
Osmanthus tea helps prevent bad breath and  eliminates toxins in the body.
For existing in general 
Passion flower tea helps with anxiety. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, passion flower is just as effective as the drug Serax for treating anxiety. In addition, the Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics states passionflower is as effective as clonidine for treating withdrawal symptoms in people, such as for anxiety and stress.

I have a particular love for the bel canto period of opera. In fact, I feel like most of the musical examples I’ve used for this column reside in this era. The bel canto style of singing, which originated in Italy during the 19th century, places particular emphasis on the natural beauty and timbre of the voice. It strays its focus from dramatic emotion or even precision of the written music — rather, bel canto flourishes on stylistic phrasing driven by how beautiful one can sing the phrase. It may not be the most dignified or high-brow style of classical music, but bel canto is my biggest guilty pleasure.
For instance, Bellini’s last opera I puritani (“The Puritans”) contains some of the most beautiful and enthralling music of the era. Given Bellini’s proclivity for writing haunting and mesmerizing melodies, it’s not hard for musicians to ease into this style of singing. One of my favorite recordings of this show is from the Metropolitan Opera in 1997, featuring Stuart Neill, Ruth Ann Swensen and Thomas Hampson — within the first 10 minutes, I’m already delirious from the expressive musicality achieved under the baton of conductor Edoardo Müller. I puritani begins with Riccardo (sung by Hampson in this recording), leader of the Puritans, who is heartbroken after learning Elvira has left him for another. Prior to the action taking place, he’d been promised Elvira’s hand in marriage by her father and plans had already been set for their impending nuptial. However, Elvira was already in love with another cavalier, Lord Arturo, and she instead chooses to marry him, with her father’s blessing. Riccardo is obviously heartbroken, and expresses his grief through his first recitativo and aria, “Or dove fuggo io mai? … Ah, per sempre io ti perdei!” (“O where … Ah, forever I have lost you!”). His music is, in my opinion, some of Bellini’s most passionate. Other operaphiles argue that Elvira’s mad scene in Act II is the opera’s tour de force — I disagree. While powerful, oftentimes her mad scene reads as self-indulgent and wanly personal. What Riccardo’s aria offers that Elvira’s doesn’t is sensitivity.
As the leader of such a large group of revolutionaries, Riccardo isn’t one to wear his heart on his sleeve; he is expected to remain stoic around his peers and colleagues. Depending on staging, he should be himself during the aria, give-or-take a few lines with Sir Bruno during the recitativo. This solitude adds adds to the sadness of the situation, so that his moment of despair is so personal that it makes me believe he’s a sensitive person at his core. I, too, am not one who is overtly effusive in public. I consider myself to be an emotional person, but these feelings are much more internal. I don’t think my proclivity to remain restrained is intentional. But in a world that’s so critical of men who emote publically, my natural instinct is to retreat. So, like Riccardo and myself, how do you cope once you’ve lost the love of your life?  How do you move on from heartbreak that devastates your life and prohibits you from moving forward.
The answer is: You don’t. At least not for a very long time.
Opera is all about extremes. There is really nothing subtle about the art form. When a character is in despair, typically they go mad, kill themselves, or both. There is no guide or tips for self-healing or counseling while dealing with a crisis. And with an opera like I puritani, where multiple characters lose their betrothed and/or go mad, things can get unsettling. Riccardo lost Elvira to another man. Later in the opera, Elvira believes she loses Arturo to another. And though the opera deals with common themes everyone is bound to experience at one point, it doesn’t give you the tools to deal with these outcomes.
Like in most stage shows or movies, the process of love and life is typically expedited. Characters are constantly falling in love at first sight. Adversely, they fall out of love just as fast as they originally fell. So when a character is in despair, their first instinct is to end their own life. As viewers, how are we supposed to interpret these decisions? Certainly, it’s absurd to resort to suicide, especially in the case of losing one another to someone else. But clearly, those who wrote these types of shows know just how hard it takes to get over someone. In their minds, it’s easier to end it rather than taking it required time to heal and cope, such as wallowing and smoking a f-ckton of weed. Maybe it’s Bellini’s cynical way of telling us that it’s better to end it all rather than dealing with hardship. That may work for fictional characters, but surely this message isn’t suited for realistic audiences.
By the end, things work out for Elvira and Arturo, but not Riccardo. His fate is left unknown, but it’s assumed he remains alone. But I find myself thinking a lot about his fate and how his life played out. Though he did try to sabotage Elvira and Arturo’s happiness, I still feel sympathetic toward him — obviously, the heartbreak caused his rationality to fly out the window. I hope he eventually got over Elvira. I hope he came to terms with their happiness and used healthy techniques thereafter to heal his emotional wounds. For Riccardo’s sake, I’m writing his life’s ending for him, because everyone deserves closure.

The USC Academic Culture Assembly will continue to execute its plans for its third annual Mental Health Awareness Month in October with eight events, including student panels and interactive attractions. The MHA events will run through the month of October.
According to the ACA, the organization aims to initiate important conversations that destigmatize and explore the intense complexity of mental health.
Communications Director Abigail Jackson said the assembly aims to reveal how mental health is a pervasive issue in University culture throughout October, even if struggles individuals face are not always visible.
“With mental health, you could see someone on the street and not see any markers of [mental health issues],” Jackson said. “In a lot of ways, that could be pretty isolating for someone who is struggling with mental health problems, because they don’t see anyone else struggling with the same thing.”
Every year, the topics and conversations surrounding Mental Health Awareness Month are centralized under a main theme. Last year’s topic focused on self-care and community care, while this year, the assembly’s topic is “Uncovering Hidden Wounds: Recognizing and Sharing Our Mental Health Stories.”
Jeffrey Cho, ACA’s financial director, explained how this year’s theme will feature current USC students and professionals to discuss their own mental health experiences and resources.
“This year, we wanted to focus on highlighting student experiences with their mental health journeys,” Cho said.
For example, one of the first events held emphasized the recognition of one’s mental wounds. During this event, the ACA hosted a panel of counselors and psychiatrists from the Engemann Student Health Center to discuss  specific symptoms and coping mechanisms for different mental illnesses, bolstering awareness for others and themselves.
Cho explains how the programming intends to reach all audiences, but it especially focuses on freshmen who may find the resources helpful during their first year.
“We are trying to also consider the freshmen that are going through this big and kind of scary transition of being an adult for the first time,” Cho said. “They should be comfortable tackling mental health issues and owning their first year here at USC.”
On Tuesday, the ACA will host a panel of students who hold executive positions of different organizations to discuss their experiences with mental health. According to Cho, the purpose of the event is to show how all kinds of students struggle with mental health and destigmatize the conversation surrounding it.
Due to the magnitude of this event, the planning for MHA began over the summer under the direction of Mental Health Awareness Month Director Jamie Wu, along with two assistant directors, Dennis Woo and Cynthia Jiang. Over the past few months, they have been reaching out to professionals, students and speakers on campus and beyond.
The organization will hold a Mental Health Resource Fair on Oct. 24 on Trousdale Parkway from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. to provide students with more information about resources from organizations on campus.
“We want to have programming that is widely accessible to every USC student and have events that are relevant to every student, especially so we can have USC students be aware of the greater picture behind the various issues we are hosting events about,” Cho said.

The Defining and Exploring South Asian Issues project at USC strives to increase the representation of South Asian voices on campus. In the midst of an international humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, as millions of Rohingya Muslims flee from persecution, the DESI project is working to raise awareness of similar South Asian issues through initiatives and fundraisers.
Started in 2005, the project serves as an initiative of the Asian Pacific American Resource Center, one of the cultural centers at USC. The DESI project aims to provide various programs that advocate and foster dialogue surrounding South Asian students and their communities, specifically for those who identify as Desi, a term that encompasses the identity of individuals from the Indian subcontinent and South Asia.
“It’s important to talk about being an American Desi,” said Muhammad Yusuf Tarr, the coordinator of the DESI program.
Tarr is a junior majoring in Middle East studies who began working with the project last semester before developing the current Rohingya initiative.
The mission of the DESI project is to create a space in which to engage students in dialogue regarding issues pertaining to Desi identity and its intersectional facets, according to Tarr.
For the past year, the project has mainly conducted documentary screenings, book clubs, panels and discussions, but due to the recent crisis in Myanmar, the organization is trying to do more.
“We wanted to host a fundraiser and utilize my position [as DESI coordinator] to create good,” Tarr said.
The Rise of Rohingya fundraiser was hosted by the DESI project, in conjunction with the Ansar Service Project, the Muslim Student Union, Students for Justice in Palestine and Students Organize for Syria.
The Rohingya are a minority ethnic group in Myanmar, a primarily Buddhist state, and have faced discriminatory policies according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The crisis in Myanmar began in August after a militant Rohingya group claimed responsibility for attacks against Burmese police. Consequently, the nation’s military has launched a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority,” according to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.
Myanmar’s military has since destroyed hundreds of Rohingya villages, forcing them to flee to surrounding countries of Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The displacement of the Rohingya Muslims continue today.
According to Tarr, the fundraiser had about 50 attendees, many of whom donated food and raised $600 for the cause.
“For our event, I went and bought a chalkboard and wrote, ‘I stand with the Rohingya because…’ and it was amazing to see so many people come by and write why they stood with Rohingya,” Tarr said.
Tarr’s main goal for the Rohingya fundraiser was to include as many voices that could speak to the wide range of issues that affect Asia as possible, ensuring that all perspectives are included. In the future, he hopes to host more events on underrepresented issues in the South Asian region.
“I am fifth-generation Indian, Muslim and a man,” Tarr said. “If I were to talk between gender issues within the region, I would have to bring in a different speaker that would be able to talk about that. Or, if we wanted to talk about the Kashmir conflict within India and Pakistan, I would want to bring in an expert on that.”
Tarr was born in the United States and his family lived in South Africa for generations. Tarr also stated that the DESI project was created so that non-East Asians would feel more included within the Asian community. He heavily emphasizes the intersectional facets of the individuals from the region and hopes to reflect that.
“Within the region, there is so much going on … I have respect [for] the diversity of that region,” Tarr said.
CORRECTIONS: A previous version of this article stated that Tarr was born in South Africa. It has since been updated to reflect his correct birthplace, the US. It also misspelled “Kashmir.” It has since been updated to reflect the correct spelling. This article also misquoted Tarr and referred to a project in Kashmir.
