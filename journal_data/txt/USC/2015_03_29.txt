Eloi Vasquez, a 19-year-old freshman at the University of California, Berkeley, has been missing since the night of March 27. Vasquez was last seen leaving a party at the USC chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon.
Vasquez’s family originally announced to local news stations Sunday night that they would be offering a $50,000 reward for any information leading to his location. They have since increased  the reward to $100,000 as of Monday morning.
Vasquez, a member of the UC Berkeley men’s soccer team, was visiting USC’s campus along with his friends and teammates Joshua Morton and Marko Helfrich for spring break when he went missing.
“At about 1:55 a.m., we called him and he said that he wanted to go to the beach, which was absurd because the beach was like a four-hour walk from [the TKE party],” Morton said.
Morton’s and Helfrich’s attempts to call their friend back went through, but no one responded on the other end of the phone. The two eventually assumed that Vasquez likely went home with someone and that they would try to reach him the next morning; however, at around 12:30 p.m. the next afternoon, they became worried when their calls went straight to Vasquez’s voicemail — likely because his phone was shut off.

The last contact anyone had with Vasquez before his disappearance was at 2:18 a.m. on March 28, when he called another friend at Berkeley and told her that he was alone and lost, and that his friends were not picking up their phones, but neither Morton nor Helfrich received any calls from him.
Morton and Helfrich filed a report with USC’s Dept. of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department and have spent the past two days passing out fliers near where Vasquez was last seen. Morton said ABC News plans to speak with Vasquez’s family to alert the greater Los Angeles area of the student’s disappearance.
The fliers describe Vasquez as 6 feet tall and approximately 175 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes; he was last seen wearing a white baseball tee with red sleeves.
If you have any information pertaining to Vasquez’s please call: 415-209-3992 or 415-209-3990.
UPDATE:
10:00 p.m. This story was updated to note that the family is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Vazquez’s location.
Monday 10:50 a.m.: This story was updated to note that the family has increased the reward to $100,000.
Hopefully Eloi turns up safe.  (Perhaps he’s intentionally made himself go missing due to a personal problem of some sort?)

President C. L. Max Nikias officially announced current interim Provost Michael Quick’s appointment as provost and senior vice president for academic affairs Sunday afternoon in a memorandum addressed to academic deans, faculty and staff.
Quick’s appointment to provost of the university will be effective as of April 1.
“I consider this to be the most significant appointment in my cabinet, as this role is vital to USC’s academic mission and will play a decisive role in the university’s continued ascent,”  Nikias said in a statement released by USC News. “Following an exhaustive search, Professor Michael Quick emerged as our top candidate, as he possesses the rare combination of abilities, experience and knowledge that will best serve our large, complex and very ambitious research university.”
Quick’s position as provost grants him the title of chief academic officer of the university and makes him the second highest-ranking university official.
Quick’s predecessor, Elizabeth Garrett, left her position as provost of the university in 2014 to assume the role of president of Cornell University. Following her departure, Quick was selected by university officials to act as interim provost on Dec. 1.
Quick will oversee an array of academic divisions on campus including: Student Affairs, USC Libraries, Research Advancement, Information Technology Services, Student Religious Life, Academic Space Planning, Global Initiatives, Academic Planning and Budget and the USC Stevens Center for Innovation. Nikias’ memorandum also noted that Quick will assume the role of chair for the Keck School of Medicine of USC’s Operations Oversight Committee.
Quick holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Emory University and has held a position as a postdoctoral research fellow for the California Institute of Technology. Quick joined USC in 2002, when he served as an associate professor of biological sciences in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences. He was promoted to professor and vice dean for research within Dornsife. Shortly after, Quick became the executive vice dean for academic affairs and was later named executive vice provost.
“In each of these roles, Professor Quick has proven to be an inspiring and tactical leader, demonstrating tremendous foresight, intellect, and resolve in advancing the university’s initiatives,” Nikias said in the memorandum.
The official search for a new university provost began immediately after Garrett resigned from her position. This resulted in the creation of a provost search faculty advisory committee consisting of Nikias, 14 university administrators and three representatives from search firm Isaacson, Miller.
The memorandum noted that Isaacson, Miller contacted 200 qualified leaders in academia from multiple universities and colleges. In addition, the university advertised the search for a new provost through various publications and websites. Students and faculty in the USC community were also encouraged to nominate possible candidates for provost through an application process. In total, Nikias said that more than 200 candidates were interviewed by the provost search faculty advisory committee for the position.
During his term as provost, Quick will oversee the progression of undergraduate and graduate research, undergraduate curriculum and graduate programs.

Four new sexual battery offenses were reported to the USC Dept. of Public Safety this past week that are in line with a string of attacks that have occurred since late February in the immediate USC area.  In all instances, female victims were approached by a male or group of males and slapped on the buttocks.
Three of the attacks are congruent with the Los Angeles Police Department’s main suspect: a lone male who approaches girls from behind — often while jogging — and slaps the victims’ buttocks.
The first of the most recently reported incidents occurred at approximately 9:30 p.m. on Thursday night at the intersection of 29th Street and Vermont Avenue. The victim was jogging when a male suspect, also jogging, ran past her and turned around. He then slapped her buttocks, smiled and ran away.
The second offense happened less than an hour later near the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house on West 28th Street. Two friends stopped to take a photo when one of the friends said she was slapped on the buttocks and saw two males flee afterward.
The next two offenses occurred a few hours later, just after midnight on Friday morning.
At 12:10 a.m., a victim was waiting for the traffic signal to turn green at the corner of 28th Street and Figueroa Street. She said a male suspect grabbed her buttocks, then quickly walked away.
The most recent attack was just 25 minutes later, near the Galen Center on the 3400 Block of Figueroa Street. The victim was approached by a male suspect, who slapped her buttocks and then kept running.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said there has been progress in the case over the last week. The two departments have been able to jointly identify a person of interest.
“LAPD has developed some leads, and there was a person of interest identified and they are [now] pursuing it closer,” he said.
LAPD released two sketches earlier this month regarding a key male suspect. He is described to be either Hispanic or East Asian, between 16 and 21 years old with black short hair in a “spiked” style. He is around 5-feet 8-inches tall and weighs between 140-160 pounds.
“We think the majority [of the crimes] are committed by one person,” Carlisle said.
This is offensive amd shocking for the victims, but nothing like many of the horrible sexual attacks that have happened since the 1960’s to unwary coeds shopping in the ‘hood or opening their door to strangers. USC takes pride in being part of the neighborhood community. Fine, but sadly, this carries considerable hazards.

The Deadline article “Pilots 2015: The Year of Ethnic Castings” by Nellie Andreeva examines the increasing castings of minorities last television season. Andreeva’s doubt of the increasing “ethnic” presence in television sparked public debates. Though the effort to organize and analyze the progression in minority castings is worth applauding, many of Andreeva’s arguments contain assumptions that are too simplistic for such a complex topic.
Andreeva starts off by describing the recent success of freshmen series that feature minorities in lead roles and the increased opportunities for them to be considered for roles that are originally written for Caucasian actors. She then reports a series of shows that focus, at least partially, on minority representations. Finally, Andreeva wonders whether this phenomenon is a positive change in the industry, or if it has gone a bit too far.
Firstly, the article was originally titled “TV Pilots 2015: The Year of Ethnic Castings — About Time or Too Much of a Good Thing,” and was later renamed “TV Pilots 2015: Ethnic Casting Trend Hits Peak.” The edit of the headline was perhaps a response to the backlash against the article. Additionally, the language of the article was extremely outdated. Salon writes that  the use of “ethnic” suggests the actors aren’t “white-passing.” Calling “ethnic” castings “too much of a good thing” is inherently problematic. It seems to suggest that the rising non-Caucasian lead roles in television can cause damage. Whether Andreeva is worried about white actors losing opportunities to minority actors, or she feels like these new pilots misrepresent the makeup of the population in the United States, her original article title aimed to call attention to possible problems that could arise with more minority actors partaking in television series. Andreeva then goes on to describe the growing number of non-Caucasian actors taking up leading roles in the pilot casting season a “big trend.” Such use of language might unintentionally diminish the significance of the improved representation of ethnic groups on television. By calling this improvement a “big trend,” the article objectifies ethnicity, making them sound like commodities that are useful for attracting audiences, rather than skilled professionals who help better represent the real demographic.
Secondly, Andreeva points out numerous examples of lead television roles that were originally written for white actors ending up being taken and performed by minority actors. Shows Andreeva bring up include roles in Extent and How to Get Away with Murder, among others. Though it is an improvement to see that showmakers are more accepting and flexible when it comes to casting ethnic actors, one fundamental problem that is still left unresolved is the limited number of intended non-Caucasian lead roles in scripted television. Looking at the number of examples Andreeva lists in her article, one can see that minority actors have to stand out much more than their Caucasian counterparts in order to be considered for many major roles. The disproportionate distribution of roles might be a result of the lack of minority writers for television shows. According to a study done by the Bunche Center at UCLA, during the 2011-2012 season, “62.5 [percent] of the writing staffs were 10 [percent] minority or less” for broadcast comedies and dramas, and “68.6 percent of the cable comedies and dramas for the 2011-12 season had writing staffs that were 10 percent minority or less.” For the playing field to be more fair for actors, the playing field for writers and showmakers needs to be even first.
Furthermore, Andreeva moves on to raise concern for white actors’ competitiveness, since she said, “there has been a significant number of parts designated as ethnic this year, making them off-limits for Caucasian actors.” She then talks about how one talent representative said that “50 [percent] of the roles in a pilot have to be ethnic” and how this “ethnic quota” results in biases against white actors. How rigid and common this particular quota is in the television industry is quite ambiguous. According to a study conducted by GLAAD, a non-governmental media monitoring organization, however, for the primetime 2014 to 2015 season, around 13 percent of characters were black, 8 percent were Latino and 4 percent were Asian. Judging from this research, actors of minority groups have not threatened the white-dominated industry or overrepresented minorities in the United States. Plus, even if the percentage of minority actors casted in new pilots is indeed larger than the percentage of said ethnicities in the actual demographic, this would still not lead to a disappearance of white actors on television.
The entertainment industry has long been favoring Caucasians and underrepresenting ethnic groups that make up a significant population in the United States. There are still only a handful of minority actors that have become household names for taking lead roles in television shows. The new pilots for last season demonstrate a more accurate representation and drastic improvement and progress for a more equal playing field for actors of diverse ethnicities. That being said, neither society nor the entertainment industry have entered a post-race era where opportunities are equally given to all races. Hopefully, as the industry attempts to diversify its actors, it also diversifies showrunners, writers and creators.

After winning two matches at the Oracle Challenge, the USC men’s tennis squad returned to Marks Stadium this past weekend to take on Pac-12 rivals Washington and Oregon. The Trojans put together two dominating performances for their fans, taking both matches by a score of 6-1.
In Friday’s match against the Washington Huskies, the Trojans lost their only point to the Huskies in doubles play, which has been troublesome for the Trojans this season. Seniors Eric Johnson and Jonny Wang put the Trojans in promising position, scoring a 6-4 victory over the Husky pairing of Joao Barra and Viktor Farkas. The Huskies fought back, notching the doubles score at one apiece, courtesy of a 6-4 victory by Emmett Egger and Jeff Hawke over seniors Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz. Washington’s Jake Douglas and Wendell Watanabe beat out junior Max de Vroome and freshman Thibault Forget 7-5 in the deciding match to give the Huskies the doubles point.
The Trojans took control of the match in singles play, taking all six singles matches.  Johnson earned the Trojans their first point with a 6-3, 6-2 win against Douglas.  Quiroz put the Trojans in the lead a short time later with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Gal Hakak. Hanfmann gave the Trojans their third point on the day by defeating Mitch Stewart in two sets by a score of 7-5, 6-3.  Wang lost the first set in his match against Barra 2-6, but Wang rebounded to win sets two and three to clinch both his own match and the overall match for the Trojans. De Vroome and sophomore Rob Bellamy each won their matches in three sets following Wang clinching the match for the Trojans.
After the match against Washington, Bellamy said focus was key after being down 4-1 in the third set.
“I just needed to go like tunnel vision,” Bellamy said. “[I needed to] focus on just myself and my movement of the ball.  Every point mattered. Fighting for every point, that was the big thing. [That mindset] needs to be [the team’s mindset] if we want to get this NCAA Championship.”
Bellamy also said there is much he needs to improve on in the future.
“Definitely not paying attention to everyone else’s court,” Bellamy said. “Not looking up at that scoreboard is a big thing. Losing concentration is just the worst thing that happens to me. As soon as I can get that all figured out, hopefully I’ll have some more straight-forward matches.”
The Trojans continued their winning ways the following afternoon in their match against the Oregon Ducks. Like they did against the Huskies, the Trojans struck first in doubles play. The first doubles point for the Trojans came courtesy of Hanfmann and Quiroz, who took down Oregon duo Daan Maasland and Joey Swaysland by a score of 6-4.  Then, de Vroome and Forget ensured the doubles point for the Trojans with a 6-4 victory of their own over Brent Chin and Cormac Clissold.  Oregon’s Daniel Sardu and Jayson Amos were leading 6-5 against Wang and Johnson before play was suspended.
The Trojans continued their momentum into singles play, claiming victory in five of the six singles matches.  De Vroome earned the first singles match point for the Trojans with two 6-4 sets against Amos.  After that, sophomore Nick Crystal put the Trojans up 3-0 with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Swaysland.  Wang was the next Trojan to finish his singles match, defeating Oregon’s Clissold 6-4, 6-1 and clinching the match for the Trojans for the second straight day.  Soon after, Forget gave his team a commanding 5-0 lead with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Chin.  Oregon earned their only point of the match in the second to last singles match between Johnson and Maasland, where Maasland took down Johnson in two sets by a score of 7-6 (3), 6-3.  Quiroz ended the match on a high note for the Trojans, winning in three hard fought sets over Sardu with a score of 7-5, 6-7 (5), 1-0 (10-3).
Following the game against Oregon, USC men’s tennis coach Peter Smith said he enjoyed watching his team play on Saturday.
“I thought we played a great match today against Oregon,” Smith said.  “That was enjoyable to be a part of. We had good energy, better energy then we’ve had. That was a great time for me with the team.”
The Trojans have five matches remaining before the Pac-12 Championship and the NCAA Team and Individual Championships.  As a senior, Quiroz is taking in every moment since this is his last season with the team.
“It’s one more month to go for me here,” Quiroz said.  “I’m just enjoying it and enjoy being with my teammates.  It’s been [an] unbelievable four years [and I’m] definitely going to miss this.  I just try to go match-by-match and just enjoy the experience and I enjoy being here.”

Last week, the NCAA released a mountain of evidence related to former USC running backs coach Todd McNair’s defamation lawsuit against the NCAA. Among the 500 plus pages of documents is concrete evidence that undoubtedly demonstrate a negative bias held by members of the infractions committee toward USC.
Of course, this wasn’t exactly a revelation. It doesn’t take a super sleuth to look at the NCAA’s actions over the past five years and recognize inconsistencies in punishments handed down.
Miami had its Ponzi scheme- running benefactor. Auburn was making cash payments to Cecil Newton. Ohio State’s number one sponsor was not Adidas or Nike, but the local tattoo parlor. North Carolina had its academically rigorous fake major for basketball players and a nice compensation plan in place for their football players. Finally, there was the most egregious and disturbing situation of all in Happy Valley with Penn State.
A broad range of rules were broken in these instances, yet the common denominator among all of these situations was the weak penalties handed down by the NCAA. In one case, sanctions were lifted before they even ended.
Up until last week, the argument could be made that talk of NCAA hypocrisy was simply bitter resentment from the Trojan faithful who couldn’t view the situation objectively. Not anymore, though. The release of those documents offer incontrovertible proof that the NCAA acted unfairly in their deliberations before punishing USC.
In the words of Dennis Green, “they are [who] we thought they were.” In the case of the NCAA, that means a hypocritical, morally bankrupt organization. It’s equally important to remember, these documents don’t paint the full picture. There are still 200 pages left of internal communication among members of the committee. There is evidence in there that led the judge in the McNair case to conclude there was “ill will or hatred” on the part of the NCAA.
It would be easy to place 100 percent of the blame for USC’s situation in the last few years on the corruption of the NCAA. That isn’t necessarily right, however. USC should have fought the penalties with more vigor, instead of complying and taking the penalties passively.
Obviously, it’s easy to critique the actions of the athletic administration in hindsight, but there were fans and ex-players calling for action three years ago. It was nice to see our athletic director finally take a firm stance last week, but where was that when the Trojans needed more scholarship players? As a program, USC has been too focused on optics and complying with the unjust and hypocritical requirements of the NCAA and during that time lost sight of the best interests of the football program.
Now that the scholarship limitations are over, the damage is done to the football program. They are already recovering. The combination of malice on the part of the NCAA and timidity on the part of USC is the culprit for the full enforcement of these unduly harsh penalties. At this point, it is simply about seeking justice for USC and ensuring broad and sweeping changes throughout the NCAA.
These documents can be the catalyst to finally take the NCAA to court. It seems that the only way to bring the NCAA to its knees is to hit it where it hurts — its purse strings. I am not a legal expert, but rudimentary research indicates that the Trojans have a case to make against the NCAA.
USC certainly performed admirably while under sanctions, going to bowl games every year they were eligible and putting together highly ranked recruiting classes. Yet, they were undoubtedly handicapped by the sanctions.
A full roster would have allowed them to possibly compete in BCS bowl games, which generates more revenue for the school than the Sun Bowl in El Paso. Sue the NCAA for that. Attendance has been down the last three years, negatively impacting revenue. Sue the NCAA for that. USC’s national brand was tarnished. Sue the NCAA for that. The list could go on and on. With USC leading the charge, the NCAA could finally be crippled by a deluge of lawsuits from not just USC, but aggrieved individuals and institutions nationwide.
Money won’t retroactively help USC win any games. It won’t help any players’ whose draft stock and professional aspirations were adversely affected by USC’s diminished spotlight. It won’t clear Todd McNair’s name, whose career in college football was ruined. What it will do, though, is offer a measure of closure to all those in the Trojan world who were unjustly affected by the culture of corruption inside the NCAA.
USC failed to act three years ago when something could have been done about the scholarships. I hope they don’t fail to capitalize on this opportunity as well. The NCAA lacks institutional control, plain and simple. If they took down USC, they can take down anyone. Someone needs to put a stop to them, and USC is in the perfect position to do so. McNair had no fear taking them to court, and the Trojans should follow his lead. If legal fees are the issue, I have no doubt that there is a contingent of the Trojan faithful who would happily fund that battle to stick it right back to the NCAA.
The time is now to finally take the NCAA down a peg. Their unbridled arrogance cannot go unchecked any longer. Though it certainly won’t compete with the shellacking USC gave Oklahoma in the national title game in 2005, watching Mark Emmert admit fault or write a check to USC would be pretty sweet in its own right. Let’s make it happen; this is a game USC will certainly win.
Jake Davidson is a sophomore majoring in accounting. His column “Davidson’s Direction” runs Mondays.
At the very least, they need to restore the games USC was forced to forfeit and put a shine back on Carroll’s tenure with the school. Reggie Bush or no Reggie Bush, the Trojans win all those games anyway given the cadre of running back talent tat was lined up behind Bush during that time.
Maybe retrieving the Heisman from the SEC surrogate thieves is asking for a step too far, but the team shouldn’t suffer the loss. I’m all for slamming the NCAA for every dollar they can and then putting it into some fund that benefits the entire student body (and maybe one multi-story graphic of Tommy Trojan flipping the bird to Paul Dee’s head stone) and then publicizing the hell out of the philanthropic action to shame the shameless curs running the NCAA.
Its time for a classy (with a bit of shameless excess), bold, massive push back against the abomination that runs college athletics and USC is just to institution to do it. C’mon Haden and lead the charge to make up for all those ND games you announced all those years!
(But I still love ya’ man.Who can stay mad when you just hears the numbers 55-24?)
What you forgot to mention was a majority of the games that were lost in the last 3 years, were lost in the 4th quarter, and not because our Trojan team didn’t have the killer instinct or the skill level to compete or the mental toughness. They lost because of the numbers. We just didn’t have the man power and were man handled in that 4th quarter when our guys just simply ran out of gas. That is what the despecible NCAA should apologize for. Subjecting our players, students and alumni to those 4th quarter performances. We did admirably well considering what we were hampered with.
BEST ARTICLE ABOUT NCAA “VIOLATIONS” ON THE PLANET !
I COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF !!
JAKE DAVIDSON, You deserve a “raise” and a “promotion” !!!
“USC should have fought the penalties with more vigor !”…, YES THAT’S OBVIOUS !
“It seems that the only way to bring the NCAA to its knees is to hit it where it hurts !” YES, DOUBLE DOWN !!
“Sue the NCAA for that !” HIT THEM AS HARD AS POSSIBLE !!!
Pat Haden, YOU ARE FIRED !
You are a disgrace to Attorneys !
You were a Great Trojan Quarterback and a True Trojan, but as an Attorney and Athletic Director,…
In respect, I’ll leave it at that !
Somebody, Anybody, get these/this “SCUM” !!!!
NCAA = “SCUM” !
“Tear” them a new “HOLE”…
FightOn 
Amen!   It’s time USC takes a stand!!!
While I am with the author on his general premise, he needs to refresh his knowledge regarding Penn State. No violations occurred at Penn State regarding Jerry Sandusky. It has been proven that the University did nothing wrong at all regarding the 1998 incident and virtually all evidence suggests it did nothing wrong regarding the 2001 incident. Furthermore, the evidence conclusively shows that Joe Paterno did exactly what was supposed to and should have done given what little he was told. The NCAA rolled back its immoral and unethical penalties levied against the most honorable, most ethical major program in college football because they know what is coming.
JK, I sure hope you are joking.  While the NCAA most likely had no business jumping into the Sandusky scandal from an athletic POV, the immorality (and criminality) of suspecting a man is raping little boys and not forcing the issue come to a stop is the most disgusting thing I can think of.
I don’t totally buy into the JoePa hate mongering, but the de facto enabling of a man who physically destroyed the very essence of little boys should make you throw up.
If this was a Janitor at Penn State who even hinted at raping boys he would have been brought to justice long before Sandusky was, and that is the problem with PSU athletics.  
There is no evidence what so ever that Joe Paterno or the three administrators suspected Sandusky. None. Not one bit. In fact, pretty much all evidence says they didn’t and that they did the right thing. You, like so many others are misinformed. Penn State athletics is the gold standard for ethical and moral behavior. Period. To say otherwise is a complete and total lie. USC and every other major school would do well to model their athletic programs after Penn State.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That there was some delicious Kool-aid, JK.
Just the facts. Nothing more, nothing less.
God I just threw up in my mouth reading this. 
Disgusting isn’t it? The evidence clearly show that Joe Paterno and Penn State did not suspect Sandusky was a pedophile yet the media and other bad actors proceeded on a witch hunt and media fire storm that far surpassed the Duke Lacross scandal that wasn’t facts be darned.
According to Reuters:
The July 2012 report by Freeh accused Spanier and other Penn State officials of covering up Sandusky’s sexual abuse of children for years in an effort to protect the university’s multimillion-dollar football program.
This would appear to be a classic definition of lack of institutional control.  This report was paid for by Penn State and has been backed up by criminal charges.
In case you missed it, or didn’t actually read the Freeh Report, the report contained precisely zero supporting evidence for that bogus accusation which completely ignored mountains of exculpatory evidence. The report was pushed by a subset of trustees as opposed to Penn State. Pretty much every accusation (as opposed to conclusion) that Freeh put forth in his fiction has been flatly disproven. The evidence is conclusive. There was not cover up and Penn State handled the incident in a completely responsible manner. 
Darn facts, getting in the way of a good lynching.
Joe Paterno had “witnessed” children being “raped” on the Penn State Campus and “looked” the other way ????????????
“YOU” NEED HELP” !!!
STAY AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA !
FREAK !!!!!!!!

After battling 16 innings in what was the longest recorded game in the history of USC baseball,  the Trojans (21-6) managed to defeat the Washington Huskies 3-2 after a scoreless game through the 16th inning, tying the series at 1-1.
USC earned this impressive win at Huskie Stadium after suffering a disappointing loss the night before, falling 5-1 as the Trojans failed to find their offense.
During Friday’s game, the Trojans were held to just one run for the first time all year. The Trojans got on board in the third inning as junior AJ Ramirez led off the inning with a double to right field. Redshirt sophomore Reggie Southall offered a sacrifice bunt, and then Ramirez came home on an RBI single from redshirt sophomore Bobby Stahel.
After gaining an early 1-0 lead in the top of the third, the Trojans allowed the five subsequent Husky runs to go unanswered. The Huskies came away with the game during the bottom of the sixth when shortstop Chris Baker smacked a first-pitch homerun out to left field, bringing in three runs and putting the Huskies in the 5-1 lead.
Trojan reliever junior Brooks Kriske entered to relieve starter junior Brent Wheatley (2-1) with one out and a runner on third and was able to make two outs without any further damage.
On Saturday, the Trojans once again struggled to get hot behind the plate before rallying in the top of the 16th inning, highlighted by a key single from sophomore Corey Dempster that gave the Trojans the 1-0 lead. Junior Timmy Robinson then followed with a two RBI single that put USC in a 3-0 lead. These three runs were essential, given the Huskies threatened a comeback in the bottom of the inning with a   two-run homer from infielder Brandon Bishop to pull within one.
Despite the Trojans’ inability to score runs through the majority of the game, head coach Dan Hubbs believes today’s win displays the tenacity and resilience of his team.
“Coming out with [Saturday’s] win really shows the resolve of this team,” Hubbs said. “We had a tough loss [Friday] and we had to scrape and claw to get the win. We didn’t have the best offensive game, we hit some balls that didn’t fall and it would’ve been really easy to get frustrated. It shows a lot of mental toughness to fight through offensive problems.”
The Trojan defense, which has seen some problems so far this season, really stepped up during Saturday’s match to hold the Huskies to zero runs through 16 innings. Junior starter Kyle Twomey went seven complete innings, striking out four and stranding multiple Husky runners to keep them off the board.
Hubbs echoes the fact that his defense managed to compensate for a less than impressive offensive showing.
“So far this season our defense has been able to slide a little bit because we’ve been able to put a good number of runs of the board, but that wasn’t the case on [Saturday] and it says a lot that our guys were able to respond to the challenge,” Hubbs said. “Blake Lacey made two really huge defensive plays that basically saved the game. The game says a lot of what we’re capable of defensively.”
Junior Tyler Gilbert threw two scoreless innings for the Trojans before giving way to junior Marc Hubberman, who threw the first one, two, three inning of the game in the 12th for the Trojans and threw a career-high 6.2 innings with five strikeouts.
Given the Trojans’ trouble with the bullpen coming through and preventing runs so far this season, both Friday and Saturday’s games reflect improvement and resolve.
“Between Gilbert and Hubberman, there was basically a complete game threw by the relievers,” Hubbs said. “For the rest of the season, I think we’re really going to need more of what we saw this weekend. We just need to keep improving in the pen and continue to do a good job like we have this weekend.”
Hubbs believes that to carry on the Trojans’ success in the weeks ahead, the team needs to continue to push themselves on offense.
“We need to do a better job of getting pitches to hit and executing,” Hubbs said. “Conditions were tough this past week with a ton of wind and the guys were trying to do much with the ball and were then unable to get on base. If we can do a better job of being able to fight through difficult conditions, we’ll be able to keep securing wins.”
The Trojans return to Dedeaux Field on Tuesday to host the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos at 6 p.m.

The men’s swimming and diving team finished in fourth place at the 2015 Men’s NCAA Championships on Iowa City, Iowa on March 28.
USC finished in fourth place in 2013, but this marks only the second time since 1990’s third place finish that USC has finished that high.
The Trojans finished fourth with 278 points. Texas was first (528) and was followed by California (399), Michigan (312), USC, Florida (248), Stanford (209), Georgia (208.5), North Carolina State (199.5), Auburn (182) and Alabama (176).
The Trojans capped off their fourth place finish with a comeback win over North Carolina State in the 400y free relay. Senior Cristian Quintero, sophomore Santo Condorelli, freshman Ralf Tribuntsov and sophomore Dylan Carter won in a school record of 2:47.06, just 0.08 ahead of North Carolina State.
“It was amazing. Swimming anchor at the NCAAs is like at no other meet,” Carter said. “I can’t compare it to anything. You don’t feel any pain. It was a great experience and I’m glad I got to enjoy it with these guys.”
Quintero swam a 42.18 for third place in the 100-yard free, just off his personal best of 42.11, giving him three top five finishes for the second consecutive year. The Trojans kicked off the meet on Thursday and found themselves in sixth place after the first day of competition.
Sophomore Reed Malone finished third in 4:11.94 in the 500-yard free. He improved on last year’s 14th place finish. Quintero, the defending NCAA champion in the distance, took fifth in 4:13.21.
In prelims of the 200-yard free relay, sophomores Condorelli and Carter, freshman Ralf Tribuntsov and Quintero went 1:15.85 to break the school record (1:16.22) and earn the second seed in the final. In the final, senior Luca Spinazzola replaced Quintero as the anchor, and the Trojans finished fifth in 1:16.55, moving up to fifth place winner North Carolina State was disqualified.
The second day of competition saw USC move up from sixth to fifth thanks to Quintero’s win in the 200-yard free and his win in the 800-yard free relay along with Carter, sophomore Michael Domagala and Malone. The Trojans broke the school record with a 6:11.64, coming from behind and retaking the lead in the final 50. This was the second win in as many years for USC in the 800-yard free relay. The last team to repeat in this event was Texas in 2009 and 2010.
“I just wanted to do my best for the team,” said Malone. “That’s what I was thinking about the whole race, doing it for the guys I train with every day. Doing it for the group and when the race is close, I want to do it for my brothers. I was so excited for the opportunity and I’m proud of the whole team.”
USC’s win in the 800-yard relay and the 400-yard relay marks the first time USC has won two relays in the same meet since 1977 when the team won the same two races.
“All season long we’ve had some tight battles,” Salo said. “I told them at the team meeting that I saw their character when we got beat by Wisconsin [earlier this season]. I saw them every week after that battle. They battled Utah, Cal in a tight meet, battled Stanford and then at the Pac-12s. They did the same thing here. It was a great team effort.”

Avenging two losses from earlier in the season, the men’s volleyball had arguably one of its best weekends of the season, taking five-set wins from conference rivals UC Santa Barbara and UCLA at the Galen Center.
The wins not only solidified the team’s spot in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference standings, but coach Bill Ferguson said it also will really increase the confidence level of the team going into the final stretch of the season. Though the two five-set matches did add some extra wear and tear to the team already late in the season, Ferguson said it was great to nonetheless come out with the wins.
“We got a lot of volleyball in this week,” he said. “It was a huge, huge weekend for us in the big picture.”
The No. 9 Trojans (14-7, 12-6 MPSF) have clinched a spot in the MPSF tournament. They currently sit in fourth place in the conference standings and are guaranteed to finish in at least eighth place at the end of the season with only four conference games remaining on the schedule. The top eight teams in the standings out of the 12-team conference are invited to the conference tournament. The winner of the MPSF tournament earns an automatic qualifier to the NCAA tournament.
On Friday, the Trojans were on the brink of losing in straight sets to No. 7 UC Santa Barbara (14-8, 10-8) for the second time this season. On Feb. 18, when the Trojans went to visit Santa Barbara, the Gauchos won 25-19, 25-17, 25-22. After the first two sets on Friday, the Trojans found themselves in need of winning three straight to pull off the victory. The Trojans did just that, avoiding a season sweep by the Gauchos, and won by a final score of 23-25, 24-26, 25-20, 25-20, 16-14.
Senior opposite Cristian Rivera led the way for the Trojans, recording 20 kills and 12 digs. Sophomore middle blocker Andy Benesh added 16 kills, freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta had 13, senior middle blocker Robert Feathers had 10 and junior outside hitter Alex Slaught contributed another 10 from the bench. Senior setter Micah Christenson led the team with 16 digs, junior libero Brooks Varni had 15 and Slaught had 11. Feathers also had three service aces, with Slaught adding two aces and Rivera notching one.
The Trojans outhit the Gauchos with a hitting percentage of .247 to .223, recorded six aces to the Gauchos’ two and had 71 digs to the Gauchos’ 63.
The Trojans had to quickly recover after the five-set marathon as they faced another team that had defeated them earlier this season the following day. On Feb. 22, UCLA defeated the Trojans 25-15, 25-23, 22-25, 25-22 at UCLA, though notably, USC was playing without Christenson that day. The Trojans were able to come out with the back-and-forth 19-25, 25-22, 14-25, 25-22, 15-11 win.
Playing in front of an estimated crowd of 2,000 fans at the Galen Center, Varni said it was among the best atmospheres for a home game in his career.
“It’s definitely up there,” he said after the game. “I think it’s a big weekend for us.”
Tuileta and Benesh led the way offensively for the Trojans, both recording 13 kills. Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Christopher Orenic and junior opposite Josh Kirchner both added nine kills. Christenson led the team with 19 digs, with Varni and Tuileta contributing 12. Christenson and Kirchner had the Trojans’ only two service aces.
UCLA outhit the Trojans, with the Bruins hitting .272 to USC’s .250. UCLA also had nine service aces to USC’s two and 15.5 team blocks to USC’s 8. But the Trojans had 55 digs to UCLA’s 49, which proved to be the edge the Trojans needed to get the win.
Ferguson said the middle blockers on the team—Benesh, Feathers and junior Tommy Leonard — were all hitting particularly well. Feathers was the most efficient with a .750 hitting percentage, Benesh hit .600 on the night and Leonard hit .333 with four kills on the night. Ferguson said the difference between the sets won and lost was the ability to pass the ball towards the middle and set up the middle blockers.
“Tommy, Robert and Andy had fantastic numbers, we just weren’t passing the ball well enough to get them the ball, and that’s credit to UCLA’s serving,” he said. “[But] I thought we picked up the passing.”
The Trojans next match is this Thursday, April 2, at Pepperdine at 7 p.m.

When astronaut Scott Kelly, who blasted into orbit on Friday for a one-year stay on the International Space Station, returns to Earth in March 2016, he will have spent more time in space than any other American astronaut. Scientists hope that his year in zero gravity will help establish the physical and psychological effects expected of long-term space missions, including an eventual NASA expedition to Mars.  Meanwhile, Dutch nonprofit Mars One is working to establish the first permanent and sustainable human colonies on the red planet, with a launch date scheduled for 2024. All of this comes on the heels of a tide of scientific literature suggesting the prior existence of water on Mars, and the likely presence of other sentient life in the universe. Therefore, recent undertakings point to outer space as the last and greatest frontier for human discovery.
Yet, despite the promise of extraterrestrial research, NASA’s funding remains highly contentious in annual congressional budget battles. Cuts to NASA’s $17.6 billion budget threaten the five decades of science and infrastructure that have been the crowning achievement of human innovation. The shrinking of the agency’s funding is not merely a consequence of recession-era pullbacks. In fact, since 1973 — the end of the Apollo lunar missions — NASA’s annual allotment has gradually declined from 1.35 percent of government spending to less than 0.6 percent.
Still, recent debate over the financial future of the agency has become particularly vitriolic. Lamar Smith, a Tea Party Republican from Texas who currently heads the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, has derided much of NASA’s work as frivolous. GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz has described the agency’s exploration of the outer solar system as a “political distraction.” These criticisms have bolstered concerns among the scientific community that GOP control of both houses of Congress will result in a draconian diminishment of grant funding and scientific spending.
Such cuts would be entirely unjustified. Even aside from the grand wonder of discovery, investment in space exploration yields tremendous advantages. Money allotted to NASA helps power innovative companies in the private sector and encourages the development of technologies that heighten prospects for the economy and security. Today, our ability to compress and transmit large data over the Internet is mostly the result of telecommunications research conducted by NASA engineers. The informational networks, the predecessors to the computers of today, were founded at the space agency. Much of the technology that we take for granted today has trickled down from the laboratories of some the country’s top space scientists and engineers.
Additionally, the study of other planets and their climate histories could help us predict the changes in earth’s climate due to increased greenhouse gases. And of course, every dollar invested in space exploration brings us one step closer to definitively answering the most primitive of scientific inquiries: Are we alone in the universe? Prominent hypotheses — from claims of fossils on Mars to suggestions that Jupiter’s moon Europa may hold oceans of water — posit that the answer to that question is just around the corner. Finding it will unlock a world of further research and might help clarify the murky story of life’s origins.
The politicization of this scientific field is not only inconvenient, but unjust. Politicians urging cuts to NASA and other extraterrestrial research grants disservice their constituents, depriving them of the knowledge and benefits to be derived from further space exploration. We must celebrate the immense achievements that have been made thus far and renew our commitment to a peaceful and determined mapping of the universe.

The all-women entrepreneurship organization SoGal, formerly known as GirlsUp, hosted the SoGal Summit, a conference for aspiring women entrepreneurs from across Southern California, on March 28 in the Seeley G. Mudd building.
During the all-day event, women attended a fireside chat, a keynote speech, entrepreneurial process panels and mentoring sessions.
Pocket Sun, the founder of SoGal and organizer of the SoGal Summit, said she hoped that the event would provide attendees with a forum to network and put forth their own business ideas.
“I wanted to take it to the next level by creating an all-day gathering, networking and celebration, so that young millennial female entrepreneurs, especially students, can showcase their innovation and get connections and resources in the SoCal startup community,” she said.
Sun said she faced much adversity in planning the event because of time constraints.
“I was told by professors, directors who have put on many conferences themselves that I can’t possibly accomplish the task in such little time even with my team’s help,” she said.
After working 12 hours a day, seven days a week for two and a half months, Sun was able to secure a location, find speakers and recruit sponsors. More than 450 tickets to the summit were sold. Blackstone LaunchPad at USC sponsored the event.
Among those who attended the SoGal Summit included Sabrina Kay of Fremont College; Robyn Ward of United Talent Agency; Melinda Moore, chief marketing officer at Crowdfunder; Erin Reilly, creative director of Annenberg Innovation Lab; and Espree Devora, founder of WeAreLATech. In total, more than 300 female entrepreneurs attended the event.
Kay gave a keynote address describing her achievements. She told her life story about how she came to achieve a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania and master’s degrees from both UPenn and USC.
She also described her business ventures in a series of industries, as the chancellor and CEO of Fremont College and the founder of the California Design College, now known as the Art Institute of California.
Kay concluded her speech imploring each audience member to remain one of the “crazy ones.” The audience responded with a standing ovation.
Her speech was followed by a pitch competition in which 10 companies, all composed of women, competed.
According to the judges, three stood out. The companies that received honorable mentions were Sportec, which aims to improve the technologies that people use in the sports industry, and ManServant, the newest form of party entertainment in which women can hire attractive men to serve them during special events.
The winner of the pitch competition was Pulp Pantry, a company that uses the excess leftover pulp from juiceries to create healthy snacks like muffins and crackers. The organization was established by Kaitlin Mogentale, a senior majoring in environmental science, and Ashley Lukashevsky, a senior majoring in international relations, and Uzo Onyejiaka, a senior majoring in business administration. However, Onyejiaka was not in attendance at the pitch competition.
Mogentale said she appreciated the opportunity to participate in the competition.
“With every pitch, our business just gets better. We have to make sure how we will impress the judges, which only leads us to rethink our business plan and improve it,” she said.
Melissa Feldman, a junior majoring in communication, said that she was able to learn how to effectively present herself in up-and-coming markets.
“As someone that is interested in entrepreneurship, the summit taught me how to present myself and about the hottest new markets,” Feldman said.
Tiffany Yin, a junior majoring in economics, said that the event was a great networking opportunity.
“I am not necessarily interested in entrepreneurship, but this was an great event that allowed me to meet people from all kinds of industries,” Yin said.
Sun also said that she was very proud of the turnout.
“We got amazing social media traction and very awesome feedback from the attendees and speakers,” she said.
UPDATE: The story has been updated to include the fact that Blackstone LaunchPad USC was a sponsor of the SoGal Summit.

As a writer and editor for a newspaper, I am very familiar with the pressure to get a piece of writing done quickly and efficiently. George R. R. Martin, the man behind the Game of Thrones universe, which has taken the TV world by storm over the last four years, is clearly much less familiar with the concept.
Martin’s recent pace in completing his works has been glacial at best. After releasing his first three books A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords in 1996, 1999 and 2000 respectively, his next two books took a combined 11 years to be released with A Feast for Crows coming out in 2005 and A Dance with Dragons coming out in 2011. When the TV show premiered three months before his last book release, the sheer volume of material that stood ahead of D.B. Weiss and David Benioff put off any concerns about how long the next book would take. Almost 5,000 pages worth of material seemed to offer plenty of time for the show to develop its menagerie of characters with a slow and steady hand.
Now, four years and four extremely successful seasons of television-rocking entertainment later, the questions about Martin’s next book The Winds of Winter have hit a fever pitch. Benioff said in an interview on March 23 what many had suspected for a long while: that the show would inevitably overcome the books and in effect, spoil the storyline for those who wanted to wait for the books to be released. Meanwhile, Martin announced plans to skip this year’s San Diego ComicCon on order to focus on writing The Winds of Winter, including a caveat that he could change his plans if he completes the book before the date of the convention. This has generally been touted as wonderful news as it would only leave one book for Martin to finish. Unfortunately, cooler heads have pointed out that a July 2015 finish for the book would be wildly optimistic given what we know about Martin’s writing style and announcements he has made on his progress.
So what is it that we know exactly? The last announcement from Martin himself estimated the book to be about one-fourth done in March 2013. In the two years since, there have not been any updates on his progress. That small fact, however, has not stopped legions of nerds from combing through Martin’s blog posts about his previous books to analyze exactly when The Winds of Winter is most likely to come out. FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver’s stat-obsessed website, ran an article dissecting everything from the times it took Martin to write all the previous books to the “Current Mood” updates Martin includes at the end of his “NotABlog” blog posts. (For those curious, Martin had been feeling 88 percent more “excited” in his previous 100 posts versus normal.) A post on Watchers on the Wall, a popular Game of Thrones fan website, dug even deeper. The writer combed through Martin’s blog posts with a Talmudic attention to detail that, if nothing else, shows just how fervent the fans of the books are to see the books keep up with the films. The Watchers article gave a prediction of a late 2016 to early 2017 release, dismissing Martin’s zeal to skip conventions to write as a red herring. (Martin skipped Worldcon to “finish” Dance with Dragons a full four years before it was actually released.)
Fans are clamoring for the next installment for a simple reason. The dynamics of the fictional universe’s fandom will be changed in a way that has never really been experienced. The Game of Thrones TV show has overall followed the arc of the books faithfully. There have been some deviations and some deaths that had not occurred in the books. But, despite these quasi-spoilers, the overall arc of the series has matched that of the books. This created a very clear divide between those whose loyalty was first and foremost to the books — let’s call them bookers — and those who only watched the series (non-bookers) and were somewhat looked down upon by the proud bookers. The argument against the series-only fans of Martin’s fictional universe came down most clearly to spoilers. Bookers took a strong sense of satisfaction from watching non-bookers reach plot twists that they had known about for years. When the show aired the Red Wedding episode in June 2013, the Internet was flooded with videos shot by bookers of their non-booker friends experiencing the series-changing moment for the first time. The degree of pride that the bookers took from knowing what was going to happen before the non-bookers mostly came across as a bit silly.
It is by no means a unique phenomenon to this fictional universe that longtime fans bristle at the influx of new fans. It appears that, to many, part of why they loved a fictional universe was the feeling of exclusivity that came with being a fan of something that most people did not know about, as opposed to the complex and interesting worlds themselves. This is why some people resisted when droves of new fans came to comic books after the wild success enjoyed by Marvel Studios, and that is why many bookers hung spoilers over the heads of non-bookers. One could say it was sort of a sign of nerd dominance.
Unfortunately for bookers, the series will not wait for Martin, its passing of the books is inevitable now. Even if Martin wraps up The Winds of Winter by July, which won’t happen, there is still no way he is completing the seventh and final installment, A Dream of Spring, in time to keep up with the series. Season five, which will premiere on April 12, will already contain some elements from A Dance With Dragons, the latest book from the series to be released. With HBO making millions from the series, there will be nothing stopping that train. Martin has talked with Benioff and Weiss at length about the overall arc of the series and essentially, as was confirmed by Benioff last week, has given them the green light to power on through, allowing the books to catch up. This news is exciting to all fans of the show but must be devastating to the bookers, as it means that in a couple years, their dynamic with non-bookers will be flipped on its head.
Nonetheless, the latest word on what happens in the Game of Thrones universe will be the show, not the books. And really, despite the plight of the bookers, it will be fascinating to see. Something like this has never really happened before. There have been plenty film adaptations of written works but a situation where the story-leading torch is passed from the books to the adaptation is unprecedented.

Modeled after the now famous TOMS one-for-one model, new L.A.-based blanket company, With a Purpose, is breaking into the market of social good in a big way.
The one-for-one concept is now familiar to the modern consumer: every one blanket the company sells, they donate one to someone in need. In this case, the blankets go to a variety of homeless shelters. The idea came to founder Josh Helland after he founded a related nonprofit that donated beds to transitional programs helping individuals break the cycle of homelessness. Working in this field helped Helland realize the great need for this simple resource. With a Purpose works to impact three main areas: homeless shelters, veteran’s aid and disaster relief.
“I set out with the goal to start a for-profit company to help generate goods to fill the holes for these nonprofits,” Helland said.
Though he acknowledged that the market for blankets was saturated, Helland and the rest of the team at With a Purpose came up with an idea that allowed them to distinguish their product: collegiate licensed blankets.
Through their website, customers can buy blankets branded with logos from 20 different large universities around the country, with that number expected to double by the fall of 2015. The resulting blanket donations are made to nonprofits that are local to the particular college. For example, many of the donations in the L.A. area through purchase of USC blankets will be made to the Downtown Women’s Center.
Though collegiate licensing can be an arduous process, Helland said it was worth it because of the resulting company exposure. This exposure and practical model might be the formula that has allowed With a Purpose to succeed in a sphere in which many businesses have failed, and Helland attributes this success to that approach.
“A lot of social entrepreneurships have great ideas but they don’t generate any money, or enough to sustain the business at least,” he said. “You need to figure out how to make money if you want to be a sustainable company.”
This might seems like common sense but is often a challenge for entrepreneurs who walk the line between public and monetary profit. And a socially beneficial business isn’t without its challenges and pitfalls. Though companies such as With a Purpose are expected to hold all aspects of their business to high social standards, at current levels of production, they can only afford to produce blankets in China.
“I don’t have any great answer on that. I recognize that there is an environmental impact,” he said.
Helland went on to say that he performed the cost-benefit analysis, and at American production prices, they wouldn’t have a feasible product or company. He highlighted that many of the universities that With a Purpose partners with are a part of the Fair Labor Association, and therefore have high standards in regards to production and operation. Helland has also personally visited their production factories in China to verify claims about worker conditions.
With a Purpose follows the growing popularity of socially beneficial, double-bottom line businesses. A double bottom line refers a company with the goal of not only fulfilling a monetary target — the traditional bottom line — but also a second bottom line of social benefit. Many millennial consumers are drawn to businesses that identify with this trend of social responsibility, which is reflected in their huge recent increase. They range from nonprofit to for-profit companies, and each choose to affect social change in a different way, be it providing goods, money, or services.
The one-for-one model has been criticized by experts in the field of social entrepreneurship as not affecting sustainable change, as it is not able to guarantee steady sources of product or service. With A Purpose’s nonprofit liaison Nick Bundra addressed this concern by highlighting the partnerships they form with local nonprofits. Bundra says that these nonprofits are the ones affecting sustainable change, through help from donors like With A Purpose.
“We might be a resource but they’re the hands and feet,” he said.
He said that he would also much rather be a donor through a one-for-one model than a purely donation-based model, as their donation fluctuations are reliant on people that have interest in building the business: customers that buy their product. By contrast, purely nonprofit organizations are dependent on donor wealth and willingness, and compete with more than 30,000 other nonprofits in the Los Angeles area for access to funds.
Bundra said that his ultimate goal is to impact people, and so working part-time with this company was a natural fit.
He advises students interested in social enterprise to have an open mindset when setting their goals, saying it is possible to have a positive impact in many lines of work. Neither Helland nor Bundra finished their college years with the specific goal of getting involved in a social good business, but found themselves drawn to the concept over the years following.
“I wouldn’t put the social good company out there as the holy grail,” he said. “You just have to be a voice for doing social good and be willing to do the work necessary.”

“Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which acts the most slowly, but the most surely, on the soul,” Ernest Dimnet, French writer, once said. This art of building becomes what we make our homes. It lives within the very designs that reflect our culture and heritage, mirrors to the eras in which they first arose. Here are a handful of breathtaking constructions from all around the world.
