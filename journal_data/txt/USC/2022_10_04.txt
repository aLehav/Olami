USC hasn’t had a quarterback like sophomore Caleb Williams in years. 
Williams is the best dual-threat player the Trojans have had under center since Sam Darnold, who simply wasn’t as elusive as Williams. Williams has a knack for keeping plays alive whenever it seems like there’s no shot. 
Through five games, he’s been one of the best quarterbacks in the country with 12 touchdowns, 1,402 passing yards and one interception — which took him five games to throw. He’s the heart of USC’s bustling offense, the captain of the ship, the (insert whatever leadership cliche you’d like) of the Trojans’ 5-0 start.
So, why even after he bounced back from his first poor game against Oregon State were questions still asked about Williams’ play? 
Look, he was terrible against the Beavers, throwing for 160 yards on 16-for-36 completions. He looked timid, inaccurate and flat-out shook playing in that rowdy environment. Head Coach Lincoln Riley had a valid explanation for Williams’ play. 
“It was just one of those nights…it’s like a pitcher in baseball. Sometimes you don’t have your best stuff,” said Riley early last week.
To make matters worse, Williams was made available to the media during the week, but didn’t actually talk to them, a bad sign for a player coming off his worst game of the season. One could say he was dodging questions. 
Riley defended his quarterback though saying Williams “had a couple of things going on, so didn’t do [media].” Williams said the same. 
“I had a few things that came up during the week, so I just had to skip it and go forth,” said Williams in a post-game press conference Saturday. “Now, I’m here.”
And here he was, shushing the doubters with an efficient 348-yard, 3 touchdown performance for the win against Arizona State. But, here some were continuing to wonder if Williams would be ready for tougher opponents such as Washington State and Utah. 
Are we forgetting who this quarterback is? Have we spoiled ourselves already? With all due respect, do we remember last season’s play between Kedon Slovis and Jaxson Dart?
Those two were doomed from the start of the season and now are excelling at their respective programs. But, they aren’t on the same level as Williams and that’s not a problem — most of the country isn’t. 
Just look at how Williams’ teammates describe him.
Redshirt senior running back Travis Dye on Williams’ ability to escape sacks: “At this point, I think it’s black magic. I don’t know. I go off and do my job looks like he’s about to be sacked and all of a sudden, he’s out of it and we have a 20-yard gain.”
Redshirt senior tight end Malcolm Epps said: “Can’t nobody mess with 1-3 for real… with him at the helm we can win the whole thing.” 
Junior wide receiver Brenden Rice said: “Caleb is a dog.” Rice went as far as to say he thought the quarterback “excelled” against Oregon State.
The players around him the most have the utmost confidence in Williams, and that’s all we need to know. No more doubts. No more wondering and thinking if big games will impact Williams’s play. 
Sure, he’s only started 12 games in his young college football career, but nothing has happened to be remotely concerned about his performances. He’s the best quarterback in the conference. 
When was the last time someone could say that about one at USC?
There hasn’t been a player like Williams under center for the Trojans in recent memory — let’s start appreciating it.

After competing as a finalist for the Wrigley Sustainability Prize, Marcela Riddick decided to pursue scuba diving, a skill useful for careers relating to sustainability and environmental science. Riddick, however, didn’t see herself represented in the skill: Only about 31% of scuba divers are women and less than 32% are non-white, according to Zippia. 
“There’s not a lot of people [who] look like me [in the scuba diving community],” Riddick said. “There’s not a lot of women divers [and] not a lot of Black and Brown divers.” 
The Scientific Diving Discovery Program at the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies aims to change that. The program teaches scuba diving and underwater research techniques to mostly undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds. Lasting three weeks, it hosted its first cohort on Catalina Island this past summer. 
Riddick, a USC alumnus and education assistant for the Wrigley Institute, helped with programming during scuba diving excursions. 
“Bringing in and starting a new generation of diverse [scuba] divers is really important in making a more inclusive community,” Riddick said. “It’s also super, super fun.”
John Heidelberg, director of the Wrigley Marine Science Center and professor of biological sciences and environmental studies, was a co-principal investigator for the program. 
Heidelberg was inspired to begin the program because scuba diving is not an accessible skill for many, he said, as it’s expensive and relies greatly on one’s geographic location. Heidelberg said he wanted students to benefit from peer learning in an experiential cohort.  
“USC is a hub of experiential learning,” Heidelberg said. “For students, being out on the island [and] being away [from] many distractions really does make that experiential learning. [It is] truly life changing.” 
The cohort was composed of seven students from institutions across the United States, including Florida A&M University, Old Dominion University and Texas A&M University. California institutions were also represented, including California State University Long Beach, University of California Santa Cruz and Los Angeles Valley College. 
Students began the program by completing prerequisites — such as their open water certification and medical clearance — prior to arriving on Catalina Island. While on the island, students completed approximately 20 scuba diving sessions, including free dives, deep dives and night dives. 
Hanna Reed, diving safety officer at the Wrigley Marine Science Center, assisted with teaching diving elements and writing the grant application for the program. Reed was inspired to help students earn a job after completing the program. 
“A huge focus of this [program] was breaking down barriers,” Reed said. “It’s already hard enough to break into a STEM field. If you throw in diving on top of it, the financial barriers are incredible.”
Scuba diving requires a financial commitment, as each diver requires individual gear. The program funded approximately half of the cohort’s gear this summer. 
“We want to really give underrepresented minority students a tangible asset that they can take with them into the workforce or into graduate school,” Heidelberg said.
The cohort had the opportunity to earn their American Academy of Underwater Sciences Scientific Diver authorization, professional-level CPR certification and Advanced National Association of Underwater Instructors Scientific Divers certification during the program.
Guest speakers from the USC Career Center and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences added a career development aspect to the program, speaking to students about how to present their scuba diving skills on a resume and during interviews. 
A grant from the National Marine Sanctuaries Foundation to increase diversity in the scuba diving field funded the Scientific Diving Discovery Program. The Wrigley Institute intends to hold the program annually and is fundraising to triple the number of students in next year’s cohort and provide scuba diving gear for every student. 
“I want these students to know that there’s a place for them in the [scuba diving] industry,” Reed said. “My goal is to make space [and] create divers that are going to inspire future generations.”

What do robots, manufacturing and stroke rehabilitation have in common? Stefanos Nikolaidis, an assistant professor in computer science in the Viterbi School of Engineering, has worked on these problems before, combining a different side of humanity with robotics.
In July, Agilent, a life sciences company bringing technologies to laboratories worldwide, presented Nikolaidis with the Agilent 2022 Early Career Professor Award for his work in human-robot collaboration in manufacturing. This award comes at a time where the ties between automation, manufacturing and the supply chain are more important than ever as a result of the pandemic, Agilent said in a press release.
Nikolaidis’ journey in robotics begins far earlier, though, as a university student in Greece, where he studied electrical and computer engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.
“One of my professors there was a robotics professor, but he was also in a wheelchair because he had [a] surgery that didn’t go very well,” Nikolaidis said. “Therefore, he had very limited mobility, but he was also doing research in robotics as a way to improve not only his own life … but also to improve other people’s lives that are in a similar situation. I found that very inspiring.”
From there, his journey has spanned multiple countries and continents, eventually bringing him to Los Angeles, where he currently studies how robots can be integrated into a human team — particularly in manufacturing.
“There has been a lot of work in robotics that has focused on how we can make robots more and more autonomous — for example, how we can have a drone fly by itself, how we can have a car drive by itself,” Nikolaidis said.
But Nikolaidis finds the reality of integrating robots into a human team to be very different from the sci-fi horrors of robots taking over the world. 
“The robot needs to be able to adapt to the preferences of the human teammates and have a shared mental model with the other teammates to be able to be a productive team member. This is where the core research question in human robot interaction is,” Nikolaidis said. “[We are researching] how we can develop algorithms that enable a robot to be productive and efficient, but at the same time to act in a way that is acceptable and in a way that is perceived as trustworthy by the human workers.”
This idea of trust has been an integral part of Nikolaidis’ work ever since his time at Carnegie Mellon University under his PhD advisor Siddhartha Srinivasa.
“[Nikolaidis] specifically looked at a couple of aspects of algorithmic human robot interaction. One of them specifically is around trust,” Srinivasa said. “What does it mean for the human to trust the robot? I think we all sort of qualitatively know what it means to trust someone, but how do you turn that into a mathematical model?”
Nikolaidis’ work is heavily focused on solving real world problems in manufacturing and other industries. When he first arrived in L.A., he visited stroke patients at the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center to see how he could use robotics to make an impact.
“I asked stroke patients there, ‘If you have a robot arm like this — I showed them some videos, some slides — what would you like the arm to do?’ People said things like assistive eating — something I worked on in the past — but what really made an impression is that a woman said, ‘I really have messy hair and that affects how I feel and my self image. I would really like a robot to help me comb my hair,’” Nikolaidis said. “We developed a hair combing system and we have been iterating on that over the years.”
Nikolaidis’ effort in speaking with those impacted stood out in particular to his faculty mentor, Maja Matari, professor of computer science, neuroscience and pediatrics.
“Engineers come up with many ideas about what stroke survivors may need. For example, engineers might think, ‘Well, they need a robot to reach things for them.’ But really, those are uninformed guesses. Unless you’re a member of the stroke survivor community, you really don’t know what it’s like and what is really needed, so you should not presume,” Matarić said. “It is really wonderful to see a young researcher like Nikolaidis not presuming, but taking the time to learn directly.”
Matarić recognizes the difficulty in these robotics problems, and said she resonates strongly with Nikolaidis’ willingness to tackle them.
“Too few researchers in robotics work on truly challenging real-world problems. Instead, researchers often find it easier to work on simulations or in toy evaluation domains, but Nikolaidis is willing to take on the hard problems, such as stroke rehabilitation, with real stroke patients,” Matarić said.
Since human-robot collaboration is still a relatively new field, there are many new outlets to be explored, especially the unpredictability of human nature. Srinivasa recognizes the difficulty of managing this mercurialness in fields such as autonomous vehicles.
“The problem is these pesky humans, because we drive and do things, like one [piece] is our intentions and our cost functions are hidden and latent and very personal. I think the second piece is that we are highly suboptimal agents, right? It’s not like we compute Nash equilibria and act accordingly,” Srinivasa said.
This challenge of finding a solution and tying together the volatility of human nature and the predictability of robots is what makes the work fulfilling for both researchers. Nikolaidis sees the potential for robots to help out at home, tying back to his original inspiration to pursue robotics.
“If we are to introduce robots at home, … by definition, a human environment where everything is chaotic and there are multiple users, then I think this is a very challenging application,” Nikolaidis said. “I think this is right now … one of the main goals in human robot interaction, which is how we can have a robot at home and be able to assist with everyday tasks and especially how it can help people with different types of disabilities and people with limited mobility.”
Although he is now at the University of Washington, Srinivasa said he cherishes the time that Nikolaidis spent with him.
“I find [Nikolaidis] to be fearless and committed to running user studies, to studying cognitive psychology papers, … to doing everything that is needed to make sure that humans and robots work effectively together. You have to be very selfless and accept the fact that to get a robot to do anything, you have to really do everything. I think [Nikolaidis] is one of the best that I’ve worked with when it comes to acknowledging that,” Srinivasa said.

My uncle has been gifting me BT21 merchandise ever since he found out I had interest in the South Korean boy band BTS. Even though I’m no longer as into BTS as I was many years ago, these BT21 trinkets with their cute characters have become a tradition of sorts. Every time we get packages from Taiwan, I find an assortment of BT21 items. 
Sometimes they’re socks. Sometimes they’re keychains. Either way, it’s a reminder that I have family that remembers and cares about me — as well as a reminder of the power of BT21 to appeal to fans in all their cuteness. In the airport, whenever I see people clutching BT21 plushies, I feel a fan-based connection there. Even on campus, if I see BT21 characters on backpacks, I immediately have a topic of conversation: a way to break the initial awkwardness that comes with small talk. 
For those who aren’t familiar with BT21, they’re the cute animated avatars created by BTS in affiliation with LINE FRIENDS CREATORS. BT21 consists of eight different characters. There’s bunny COOKY (Jungkook), koala KOYA (RM), alpaca RJ (Jin), puppy CHIMMY (Jimin), heart TATA (V), cookie SHOOKY (Suga), pony MANG (J-Hope),  and finally VAN, who represents the BTS fandom affectionately called ARMY. 
If you watch the YouTube video series that documents the creation of BT21, you’ll see the members of BTS sketching out their blueprint concepts for their characters. Even if you’re not a member of BTS ARMY, these videos are a wonderful glimpse into the process of creating personalized animation. 
Viewers get the opportunity to see the members’ conversations about their characters while they’re being developed, as well as compare and contrast the different iterations of the characters from start to finish. (For BTS ARMY, the members’ humorous interactions also make it a fun watching experience.) 
BT21 characters are modeled after aspects of the members’ personalities, which adds a dimension of relatability. If you already love the members for who they are, then it’s almost guaranteed that you’ll love BT21, who distill the essence of the members into unbelievably cute characters. COOKY, for example, shares Jungkook’s fondness for boxing, while RJ is also a cook like Jin.
BT21 has actively spread awareness of BTS, but mostly they’re a revolutionary form of cuteness when it comes to K-pop idols and their engagement with an international audience. Thus far, BT21 has collaborated with many relevant brands and platforms such as Facebook Messenger, skincare company Mediheal and even Incheon International Airport. Personally, there’s been many times where I’ve used BT21 nose pore strips and sheet masks — all the product of a partnership with K-Beauty brand The Crème Shop, which has been particularly fruitful for a skincare junkie like myself. 
This is an incredible testament to the implications of merchandising and marketing digital art as physical products. I know that, as a fan, I want to have a concrete means of connection. If I’m wearing a BT21 face mask (again, kudos to The Crème Shop), I’m hoping that, while being coronavirus-safe, that people who also love BT21 will resonate with it.
It might seem silly to use a mere face mask as a reinforcement of my love of the characters — and by no means do fans need to have material things to prove their love for a band, which is an idea that I find incredibly classist — but whenever I do have these items on me, I’m reminded of their visibility to fans everywhere.
BT21 and their animations are inarguably a mechanism for greater visibility. Their presence is a means of global engagement, as I’ve seen BT21 merchandise everywhere from New York to Taipei. Their animated shorts on YouTube also feel like whole television shows on their own.
My favorite part about BT21 in relation to such shorts is their promotional role for the Incheon airport. Seeing these characters engage in standard airport activities that might otherwise seem mundane — checking in bags or eating — redefines my own interactions with the airport. 
Perhaps BT21 at Incheon International Airport is also symbolic of BTS’s role in increasing awareness of South Korean culture and their groundbreaking status in South Korean entertainment. Either way, the next time I end up going to a LINE FRIENDS store, I’ll be looking out for BT21 merchandise, just to remind myself of the global power they have.

Nestled on green turf and illuminated by twinkling fairy lights, the Epstein Family Plaza transformed from its usual section of dust in the middle of the Viterbi Engineering Quad. Students flowed through the Plaza and clustered together on blankets by the center stage in anticipation of the 2022 Viterbi Fall Concert, which promised “a casual and fun night” of live music from fellow USC students.
Sept. 30 marked both the end of the month and the start of something new for Viterbi — this was the first Viterbi Fall Concert at USC, organized by Viterbi Admission and Student Engagement in collaboration with the Viterbi Graduate Student Association. Both VASE and VGSA work with Viterbi students to coordinate and host social, professional and academic events on campus.
Juli Legat, assistant director of events and programs in the Viterbi Student Engagement Team at VASE and a graduate student studying communication management, originally pitched the idea for the concert. 
 “I’m responsible for new student transition … I do plan a whole bunch of welcome events for students, not just for brand-new students, but continuing students too,” Legat said. “It’s kind of like this ‘welcome back to campus.’ We’re really happy to have you and we want to try to provide lots of opportunities to engage and to meet other students and to feel really connected to our school.”
The Fall Concert was the final event in Viterbi’s Welcome Experience lineup. 
“I definitely had a vision for it,” Legat said. “[Which] was something very chill and casual … I really wanted this to be something that students could just enjoy … and more than that, chat with their friends and just have a place to kind of hang out with each other while music is playing.”
Legat’s vision certainly came to life. Students lounged on blankets, tarps and chairs, chatting among each other as VGSA senators and representatives introduced the bands and operated food carts serving up free popcorn, nachos and cotton candy to students. Other VGSA members handed out free Viterbi T-shirts to students roaming in and out of the Plaza and set up field games like corn hole and giant Jenga.
Musical performances from USC students took center stage. Gabriel Mozes, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering, opened the night with an original indie pop set about love, heartbreak and the excitement of being young.  
“This [was] actually my first time performing in front of people ever,” Mozes said. “[So] that was nerve-wracking, but I greatly appreciate it. It was very fun … There’s something special about singing your own music because it just means so much to me, all of the songs that I write.”
Casual Chaos, a punk rock band, charged up the atmosphere with an indie rock set where they covered classic alt and indie rock songs and performed an original piece.
 “I had a very fun opportunity to talk to Casual Chaos,” said Sam Thananopavarn, a freshman majoring in computer science, who was in attendance. “I haven’t had this kind of experience before as a college student — you know, the sort of experience where you can talk to the band members.”
Interspersed between sets, VGSA members brought audience members on stage for trivia and stand-up routines. Aleyeh Roknaldin, the executive vice president of VGSA and a doctoral student studying industrial and systems engineering, worked as co-MC for the night. 
“I really like that some of the performers were Viterbi grad students and showcasing the different interests that you can have, because sometimes in engineering, it can be really intense … So many people have different talents and hobbies outside of being an engineer, and that actually helps them to become a better engineer. Creativity is so important,” Roknaldin said.
For the final performance, a mixed group of USC students and outside musicians took to the stage. This group switched up the energy of the crowd to a more chill atmosphere with an hour-long set of pop covers. 
Ajani Harris, a junior majoring in vocal arts and opera who was a part of the performance, shared how much he enjoyed the event. 
 “I would like to see more schools do sort of the same thing, like a welcome back concert,” Harris said. “It was a really nice opportunity for us to perform and for people to come out and support what was going on.” 
Although VASE and VGSA don’t currently have plans for another concert, their first Viterbi Fall Concert proved to be a successful experiment. Not only did the concert allow students a moment of respite between midterms, but it also gave students a chance to showcase their skills and talents beyond their major.

With heavy breathing and sweat dripping from their foreheads, a classroom full of students settled down for the experience of a lifetime. It was finally time for them to meet and listen to one of the most influential and talented people in the world of film.
On Sept. 29, the Los Angeles Screening Club hosted a private Q&A with filmmaker and professor of cinematic writing for screen and television Mary Sweeney. Her frequent collaborations with David Lynch, mostly as an editor, helped shape his iconic brand of surrealism and bring a real American audience to avant-garde film and television.
There are few editors in the world with a resumé like Sweeney’s, with credits on the hugely popular “Twin Peaks,” “Lost Highway” (which, despite being poorly received in its time, has achieved cult status and inspired countless psychological thrillers) and “Mulholland Drive” (often cited as the best film of the 21st century). Her influence is undeniable, both in Lynch’s body of work and contemporary surrealist cinema. 
Jack Yonover and Elijah Davis, juniors studying philosophy and cinema and media studies respectively, spent over a month to make the event happen, when suddenly it was all in jeopardy. Forty minutes before their discussion was supposed to take place, Yonover and Davis realized USC flipped their location from Taper Hall to Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, forcing students to sprint to the other end of campus. 
But, despite the logistical nightmare, room 101 couldn’t have been more full. The passion in the room was palpable, with everyone eager to learn from Sweeney. 
Just a few months ago, Yonover and Davis couldn’t have imagined hosting an event like this. The two met at a summer film class in 2019 before they were admitted as undergrads, bonding over their shared love of cinema. Now, just three years later, they’ve built an enthusiastic community of over 200 similarly minded students with the Los Angeles Screening Club. 
Yonover and Davis spent the first semester of their sophomore year frequenting the repertory theaters of L.A. to catch American and foreign language classics on the big screen. While encouraged by the packed cinema houses, the pair could not help but notice the lack of people their age in attendance. Hoping to fight this existential threat to cinema within their peer group, the duo founded LASC. 
The day before the event, Yonover and Davis brought LASC members to a 35mm screening of “Lost Highway.” Now, they offered them a chance to critically engage with the work in a meaningful way. 
He and Davis facilitated a fascinating conversation with Sweeney before opening it up to audience questions. She spoke directly to the students in the room, providing invaluable insight into her creative process. After an hour and a half of back and forth, the event was brought to a close. According to Yonover, Sweeney’s final words were “I hope this club becomes enormous.” 
Yonover later asked Sweeney about the qualities you need to be a great editor and filmmaker.  
“You need to be both a car mechanic and a dreamer poet,” Sweeney said. 
This statement provoked the crowd. The duality of the two opposing occupations best described her approach to her own work and is something for others in her field to live by. Davis elaborated on her response and his new understanding of it.
“[I would like to balance] the craftsmanship of trying to create art that is super surreal and dreamlike,” Davis said.
Many club members also reflected deeply about what Sweeney talked about, including Eli Scott, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and economics. 
“[The Q&A] was really enlightening,” Scott said. “It’s still soaking in … I feel like we developed a real connection with somebody who changed the landscape of editing into surrealism, more than perhaps anybody else in filmmaking.”
Yonover summed up the event best. 
“I was really happy with the way the event went … We ended up having a packed crowd. The room was filled to the brim,” he said. “I got to learn so much about her creative process … She enjoyed getting an opportunity to talk with so many students who are passionate about film … but also took the time in their day on a school night to go see ‘Lost Highway’ on 35 mm.”

Far too many brutal reminders came with the monkeypox outbreak. Queer and trans communities suffered flashbacks to the 1980s HIV/AIDS epidemic — thanks to the Reagan administration dismissing it as a “gay plague” and widespread sentiment that it was “God’s punishment for immoral sexual behavior,”— that killed hundreds of thousands in the United States. Things aren’t as dystopian this time, but barriers are still steep. Anyone who has tried to make a monkeypox vaccine appointment will recall having to navigate a nightmarish digital maze, a process especially daunting for undocumented persons or immigrants who may be hesitant to enter personal information.
In all of this chaos, I can’t help but feel as though there’s one tiny, tiny detail that we’re missing:
Africa — where monkeypox originated and is endemic, where the case fatality rate is 2.9% compared to 0.2% everywhere else — has zero monkeypox vaccines. None.
I looked far and wide in a desperate streak to disprove it. The most recent update I could find was from Sept. 2, when Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, told WHO leadership in Geneva that “we are in touch with Japan” about donating 100,000 doses for research. He did not specify who would receive these donations and how much. But what is certain is Africa isn’t getting enough for even clinical research, never mind public distribution.
Besides that, I encountered the same story over and over again. The U.S. allocated more than one million doses throughout its jurisdictions, as of Sept. 28 — meanwhile letting 20 million smallpox vaccines, also effective against monkeypox, expire. The European Union allocated over 100,000 doses to member states four months ago. But for the rest of the world, silence. The WHO is negotiating with manufacturers to ensure equitable access, which it has long promoted since it declared monkeypox as a global public health emergency, but it can only do so much when the vaccine’s supply is limited and all hoarded by the global North.
So, here we have a set of first-world countries refusing to share their vaccine supply, despite monkeypox now being a slowing (yet continually stable) threat in the West — and a set of third-world countries which must suffer at the expense of the hoarders’ greed.
Medical neglect of Africa by Europe and the U.S. is part of a centuries-long, and still ongoing, pattern of oppression and abuse, and to explain it in any sort of detail would require not a column, but a college history textbook, at least. But I would like to take this time with you to cover a couple highlights:
Coronavirus pandemic
We needn’t go far to find other examples of inequality against Africa. The Brookings Institution reported as of January that 14% of Africans had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Every other continent besides Oceania had long surpassed 60%.
The WHO in December 2021 called for “achievement of 70% coverage with [coronavirus] vaccines in all countries as a global imperative.” This goal was feasible, if not perfectly achievable. But as the rich often do, first world countries bought up all the supply and, despite a later surplus, refused to share with the rest of the world. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. rejected COVAX, the WHO’s initiative to provide equitable access to vaccines, and instead initiated Operation Warp Speed, working to accelerate the creation of its own supply. Even wealthy countries within the COVAX alliance hoarded vaccines, ignoring expert warnings that “collective immunity remained out of reach” if they continued to do so.
Now, the West is swinging between declaring the pandemic is over and lamenting that the disease must be lived with — an outcome which was entirely preventable. But oh, well.
HIV/AIDS epidemic
Considerable scientific and social progress since 1981 stabilized the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Sub-Saharan Africa, however, remains “the world’s epicenter of HIV/AIDS,” as the Population Reference Bureau wrote as early as 2002. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS further reported in 2021 that 20.6 million of 38.4 million people living with HIV were in eastern and southern Africa.
For every new treatment against HIV that becomes standard in the U.S., it takes years, if not decades, for the treatment to be made available in Africa. After researchers developed highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996, it wasn’t until the mid-2000s that sub-Saharan Africans began receiving the treatment. The same was true for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — and as of 2016, it was still unavailable through public programs in the region. 
Even now, after researchers last year developed a new injectable PrEP, Africans have no idea when they will receive it at an affordable price. Viiv Healthcare, the developer, is blaming the wait on having to lower its prices (in the U.S., the drug is billed at $22,000 annually) while activists accuse them of “dragging their feet.” You can probably guess my conclusion.
Honestly, this blatant repetition of the same “mistake” would be a bit boring if it wasn’t for the fact that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives are at stake because of it. Western governments either don’t know the ramifications of their actions (highly unlikely), or they simply don’t care. It is up to us to break that pattern — and that starts with acknowledging that this atrocious pattern exists.

Recently, I read an opinion article from the Washington Post called “I had a late-term abortion. But saying I’m ‘pro-choice’ is a problem.” The article was written by Laurel Marlantes, who was forced to choose to abort because doctors told her that her infant’s chance of survival were slim to none. My initial impression from the title, and perhaps yours, was that Marlantes would try to argue if pro-choice is better or worse than pro-life, but she focused more on the word choice, emotions and decisions that the terms do not adequately encompass. 
When Roe v. Wade was overturned, I focused on the fact that pregnant people would not be able to have the choice to decide if an abortion was right for them. For me, the overturning of this monumental court case meant that precedents based on the Due Process Clause — such as Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same sex marriage — could be reversed.
Politically, I am for pro-choice. I believe that pregnant people should have the ability to decide what is best for them rather than being forced to have only one option. Only the expectant person knows what choice they need to make to support themselves according to their own situation and their own emotions. No one has the right to dictate another person’s life. However, we need to abandon these terms entirely because the vernacular we choose to discuss the topic of abortion is much too oversimplified. 
One of my favorite lines in Marlantes’ article says that, “The word ‘choice’ trivializes the profound seriousness of the issue. We use the same word to say whether we want cheddar or American cheese on our hamburgers. Mayo or mustard. It can feel downright demeaning.” 
Outside of the fact that these terms can belittle the emotional aspects of an expectant person’s decision, the terms do not make sense because oftentimes, it isn’t a choice. Sometimes, there are unforeseen events — health risks, rape, and more — that force a pregnant person to choose whether or not to have an abortion. For this reason, the connotation of these words do not give a fair overview of what an abortion truly entails. 
As stated by the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts, “Focusing on someone’s “choice” erases the structural, societal factors that determine how and if someone can get health care, and the quality of that care. These factors are not incidental or insignificant: they leave many people with no choices at all.” Bringing a child into the world comes with responsibilities that many aren’t ready for, especially if they didn’t plan on having children.
According to research conducted by BMC Women’s Health, the driving decision for a majority of women seeking an abortion was concerns regarding the well-being of future and current children in conjunction with existing commitments and responsibilities. The arduous question of whether or not to bring a child into the world without the means to give the child a safe and happy life is not one that can be answered easily.
Abortion cannot be defined by two simple terms. The connotations these phrases carry force certain religious, moral and political opinions and beliefs onto the general public, when the real issue we should focus on is giving pregnant people the ability to do what is best for themselves. In an ideal world, pregnant people would have the option of abortion without having to use the political jargon that downplays their experiences. 
Words matter, and in failing to use the right words, we open the doors to miscommunication and misinformation. Through the use of these inappropriate terms, society has bifurcated an immensely complex issue, which not only lets emotions control our thoughts, but it also leaves all of our morals disoriented. Before you go out with your cardboard sign protesting for or against abortion, ask yourself if these terms truly describe your beliefs.

Women’s soccer shutout Oregon Sunday afternoon, securing their second straight victory on the road as they defeated the Ducks 4-0.
The No. 20 Trojans’ two victories on the road this weekend, the first being their Thursday night defeat of Oregon State, elevates USC to 3-0 in Pac-12 play. 
The Trojans’ offensive explosion prompted victory: The Trojans scored 4 goals against Oregon, which followed their 5-goal performance against Oregon State. It took only 9 minutes for the Trojans to get on the board Sunday when senior midfielder Croix Bethune scored on a penalty kick. 
“​​I was glad that we converted early, so that we could just manage and get a lot of players in,” said Head Coach Jane Alukonis. 
The Trojans scored twice more in the first half: Sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer scored in the 33rd minute, assisted by sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo and sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio, and Bethune scored her second goal in the 37th minute, assisted by Farmer and sophomore forward/defender Kayla Colbert. The Trojans’ only second half goal came in the 565th minute from Colbert, who was assisted by Bethune and Awujo.
“We have just been working really well together,” Alukonis said of the Trojans’ fluid offensive performance. “We try to train players who play together, next to each other, often.”
The Trojans’ offense has not only been more productive in the past games, but also more diverse. Six different Trojans have notched goals in the past two games: Bethune and Colbert also scored against Oregon State, and were joined by Awujo, sophomore forward Simone Jackson , and senior forward Hannah White.
“The adjustments came back when we played Irvine,” Alukonis said. “After the Nebraska tie, we knew we needed to change things up, shake things up, and since then I think the team has done really well working together to combine to create goals.”
The Trojans leave Oregon undefeated in the last eight games, and victories in their last four. Their last tie game was on Sept. 11 against Nebraska.   
The Trojans’ win streak is also due to the incredible work of their defense, which has allowed only two goals in three matches against Pac-12 opponents and shut out Oregon.
“Trying to get our distances and level of pressure right, and always having a plan of how we want to defend the opponent, I think it has been a really good team effort in that department,” Alukonis said. “But also, we keep improving and need to keep improving to close down the opponent even more and tighten up the spaces even more.”
The Trojans’ defense allowed only seven shots against Oregon, with only two on goal, compared to the 26 total shots generated on offense. 
Following their two-game road trip, the Trojans face a short rest period before a two-game homestand next weekend against Arizona on Thursday and Arizona State Sunday afternoon. 
“At the beginning of the season, we map out our entire season’s periodization so that each day has an appropriate amount of load, not too much, not too little,” Alukonis said. “We also always look at minutes, how players feel, how much they’re sleeping and all of that, and make sure we try to get them as fresh and rested as possible.”
To prepare, the Trojans will face a light work week to ensure they are fresh and ready to continue to dominate conference play.
“This is one of the odd training weeks,” Alukonis said. “We’ll see it often, but you take tomorrow to recover and you take Tuesday off, and then you have a preparative training on Wednesday. Super quick turnaround, where we’ll do more learning in the classroom rather than a ton on the field.”
Still, the Trojans are ready to face the challenge ahead.
“Every game we come into knowing the opponent will give us a very hard-fought, tough game,” Alukonis said. “Continuing to build on what we have been doing, so creating the attack, working together, overall defensive organization and just tighter pressure on the ball [will be key].”
