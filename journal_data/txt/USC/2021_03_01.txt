The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team swept both competitors at the ASU Invitational in Scottsdale, Ariz. this weekend, picking up four wins to put them at a perfect 5-0 record on the season. 
Despite not competing for almost two weeks, the Trojans were able to hold off a No. 4 Arizona State team that has had some of the most consistent practice of any during the pandemic, and a No. 6 Michigan team looking to earn its first victory over USC in the program’s history. 
In their first matchup of the weekend bright and early Friday morning, the Trojans turned a one-point halftime lead into a 16-8 blowout against the Sun Devils. After junior driver Grace Tehaney secured the 8-7 lead at halftime by sneaking in a point on a 6-on-5, the Trojan defense allowed only one point from the Sun Devils in the second — on a 5-meter penalty shot from ASU that kept USC redshirt senior goalie Holly Parker’s save percentage at over .500. 
The Sun Devils brought new talent into the fold and experimented with different sub rotations, something USC also tested to get newcomers some early-season experience, head coach Marko Pintaric said. 
“Both opponents are very respectful and they’re good opponents. So, we try to give as much playing time — so that’s why some scores might be better, might be worse,” Pintaric said. “I think for all three teams, this was a very, very good tournament and very good test going into the season.”
MPSF player of the week redshirt senior utility Maud Megens matched her five-goal performance against Irvine in this game, bringing her into USC’s all-time top-ten in career goals with 173. Behind Megens’ strong scoring performance was redshirt senior driver Kelsey McIntosh who had a hat trick of her own. Tehaney, sophomore driver Téa Poljak, senior driver Verica Bakoc and redshirt senior driver Denise Mammolito all sent two goals to the back of the net as well.   
The strong offense would continue to perform in the next games, though the Sun Devils and Wolverines found ways to slow down the Trojan offense.
“We were not happy then again with our offense, our offense was not as crisp, we missed a lot of easy opportunities — we call it a high percentage opportunity,” Pintaric said. “That was something that we addressed that day … so those were the judgements pretty much that we were interested in throughout the tournament.”
Saturday’s schedule was dotted with USC’s second game against ASU in the morning and its first against Michigan in the afternoon. 
The morning matchup was much tighter than the Trojans’ first win over the Sun Devils Friday. Both teams started slow offensively but USC picked up momentum in the second period after a huge 5-meter penalty save from sophomore goalie Carolyne Stern. Up three heading into the second half, the Trojans’ single goal in the third from Mammolito put the team captain in USC’s top-20 career scoring list with 128 goals to her name. 
Defensive falters in the fourth allowed the Sun Devils to close up the gap with two 6-on-5 conversions with a minute to go, but USC held it down until the buzzer to capture another win at 6-5. 
Later in the day the Trojans went up against a slow-to-start Michigan, gaining a 3-point lead over the Wolverines, including one from freshman 2-meter Hannah Meyer, her first as a Trojan. Junior 2-meter All-American Mireia Guiral shined in the third after earning a hat trick and a 8-4 lead going into the fourth. Both teams went goal-for-goal as the clock wound down but the Trojans held their own for a 10-6 win. 
This was Guiral’s first performance with the Trojans after a year’s absence due to training with the Spanish national team. 
To build on the high scoring over the course of the invitational, the Trojans went even further Sunday morning against the Wolverines with three players — junior utility Bayley Weber, Tehaney and Megens — securing USC’s lead with a hat trick each. The Trojan field defensive remained steady as some of the only points Michigan was able to tally came from 5-meter or 6-on-5 conversions. 
Like USC, Michigan is a physical team known for their hard press and drives. Adapting the Trojans’ offense to spread and handle that pressure without giving up exclusions will be part of their training for the next few weeks. 
“Michigan drew a lot of penalties on us as well,” Pintaric said. “Even in the second game, they open up every quarter with a penalty. And again, we review film — it was just [an] obvious little mistakes. But again, those little mistakes can actually cost you later. So we’re going to address those issues immediately and try to fix them.”
Up next for the Trojans is another long waiting period until their first MPSF conference matches March 20-21 against No. 8 Cal on the road. The Bears are also undefeated with a 4-0 record but face tough upcoming matchups against UC Santa Barbara and UCLA that’ll give the Trojans an opportunity to study up on the Gauchos’ game strategy against higher-ranked teams.

USC baseball completed its second series of the season this past weekend at Dedeaux Field. The Trojans dropped the first two games of the series before avoiding a sweep with a victory Sunday.
The Trojans were hoping to build upon their first series in almost a year after winning two out of three against Loyola Marymount University last weekend. Prior to the series against LMU, the Trojans had not played competitively in nearly a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  
“Without having a fall to work out some of the kinks we usually get to with a normal season I think we are definitely trying to work through some of those things with real games right now,” redshirt junior Ben Ramirez said. “Every game that goes by I think we are getting a little bit better, so I’m excited to see where we are at as the season goes on.”
USC lost the first game against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Friday evening with a score of 2-1. The Mustangs were coming off a four-game series against Nevada in which they lost three-straight after winning the opening game. The game saw a flurry of late action as neither team scored in the first four innings. 
Cal Poly broke the deadlock in the fifth inning with an RBI single from redshirt senior Myles Emmerson. USC tied the game at one in the bottom of the sixth with a walk from Ramirez. 
USC redshirt junior pitcher Isaac Esqueda allowed just one run in six innings, but the Trojans’ bullpen could not match Esqueda’s dominance. Freshman pitcher Jaden Agassi allowed a go-ahead run from Cal Poly redshirt junior Matt Lopez in the eighth inning which ultimately led to USC’s loss. The Trojans dropped the second game of the series in a different fashion, as an offensive showcase from the Mustangs buried the Trojans Saturday by a score of 9-4. 
The game was closely fought with USC and Cal Poly tied at 4-4 after the first seven innings. Redshirt freshman outfielder Rhylan Thomas added his first career solo home run as the Trojans hung with Cal Poly early. Head coach Jason Gill spoke highly of Thomas and others at the top of the lineup, saying their plate approaches improved from last week against LMU.
“The first weekend, I don’t think Rhylan Thomas and Tyresse Turner, the top of our lineup guys that we count on to get on base and touch home plate … were as locked in.” Gill said. “This weekend I felt like those two guys did a really good job of setting the table and sometimes the middle of our lineup wasn’t there.” 
Shortly after Esqueda’s removal, Cal Poly scored three runs in the eighth and two in the ninth to go up on the Trojans and secure the win Saturday. 
After consecutive losses Friday and Saturday, USC finished the series with a 7-6 win Sunday. Gill and company came out strong with both Turner and Ramirez recording RBI singles in the first inning, helping USC jump out to a 6-0 lead after two frames. 
“With those first two games not going our way, I think everyone came in with kind of a different attitude trying to salvage the Sunday,” Ramirez said. “We definitely had some more fight towards the beginning of the game. We still have some stuff to work on as the game goes on, but it was definitely a good fight.”
After redshirt junior outfielder Jamal O’Guinn had an RBI single and Ramirez recorded a bases-loaded triple, the Trojans enjoyed their largest lead of the three-game series.
The Trojan offense and pitching staff cooled down as the game wore on, as Cal Poly did not allow USC to score in the following four innings while scoring four of their own in that time span. 
“We definitely need to try and work on focusing a little more towards the end of those long games so we can finish strong,” Ramirez said. 
The Trojans held on after both they and the Mustangs traded runs late in the contest. Despite avoiding the series sweep, Gill wasn’t pleased with USC’s defensive efficiency.
“Where the fault was, was our defense and that’s not what you’re gonna see out of our teams typically,” Gill said. “We are just not very confident defensively.” 
USC comes out of this series with a 3-3 season record, one game off the pace it set after six games last season.
“It’s so early in the season. Sure we’d like to be 6-0. We don’t like being .500. We definitely didn’t like being under .500 going into the day. That’s not what we’re about,” Gill said. “But there’s a long season ahead of us, and we have a lot of room to grow, which is something we are looking forward to doing with these guys.” 
This week the Trojans will host Cal State Fullerton Friday, Pepperdine Saturday and will travel to UCLA Sunday as part of the Southern California College Baseball Classic. The Trojans defeated then-defending national champions Vanderbilt in last year’s classic while also defeating TCU and suffering a blowout loss to UCLA.

USC fell short against No. 10 UCLA 93-51 Friday at Pauley Pavillion in the Trojans’ regular-season finale. The Trojans are now No. 8 in the Pac-12 standings and face a major uphill-battle heading into the Pac-12 tournament. 
The Trojans started strong in the first half against the Bruins with sophomore forward Alissa Pili and freshman forward Jordyn Jenkins leading the charge. Pili led the team with 18 points and five rebounds. Jenkins contributed a career-high 14 points. 
Both teams started off slow settling into the game. USC trailed the entire game with their smallest deficit coming in the first quarter when they were down by only three. As the game progressed, however, the Trojans were unable to find their footing, and trailed the Bruins 29-12 by halftime. 
UCLA started to find their rhythm and USC could not find an answer to counter sophomore guard Charisma Osborne and senior forward Michaela Oneynwere’s. Osborne recorded a triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. Oneynwere scored a game-high 30 points, shooting perfect 6-6 from the 3-point line. 
“She seems to be a world-class athlete,” said head coach Mark Trakh of Onyenwere. “She’s got speed, she’s got explosion, she jumps out of the gym. She has a high IQ and [is] a future WNBA star … She’s got the whole package.” 
Jenkins had the task of guarding Oneynwere for the majority of the game and was excited for the challenge, knowing it wouldn’t be easy.   
“Matching up with her was tough,” Jenkins said.  “Especially on her senior night and me as a freshman. I knew I was in for a run. She went 6-6 from the 3-point line. She’s a great player … It was good to play against her.”
As the Trojans trailed 69-39 going into the fourth quarter, they could not find an offensive spark from Sophomore guard Endyia Rogers and Graduate transfer Jordan Sanders. Both ended the game with five points.
USC could not sustain long offensive runs, shooting 34% from the floor and making only five 3-pointers the entire game. UCLA made 16 3-pointers and shot 51% from the field. 
After the game, Trakh acknowledged that his team struggled to find their rhythm the last few games and was optimistic that they will regain it going into the tournament.
“They played very well,” Trakh said. “We’ve kind of lost our stride these last three games. I just think we’ll regain it before the Pac-12 tournament. I think we’ve been trying to wait on a lot of people coming back from injuries. We just gotta find our stride. We will be fine.” 
The Trojans struggled to minimize their turnovers on offense and ended the game with 19 turnovers in comparison to the Bruins 11. Trakh believes it was a combination of the Bruins’ ability to move the ball and his team’s lack of defense that was the deciding factor in the game. 
“I think it was ball movement,” Trakh said. “They are very athletic. They shot the ball really well. Our defense needs to get better. We got to guard behind the line a lot better … We do have  to tighten up.” 
Trakh made it clear that defense was the central issue for his team but that the biggest upside of the game for him was the return of Jenkins after being injured at the beginning of the season. 
“I think we have found [something] special over here in Jordyn”, Trakh said.  “She suffered an ACL in high school and was out for a year. She’s only been really back with us for a month right now … The one bright spot of today’s game was  the way Jordyn played tonight. I was really happy and proud of the way she competed tonight.”  
USC now waits for their seeding in the Pac-12 tournament. The Trojans will likely find themselves at No.8, which would put them against the No. 9 seed in a first-round game March 3 at 2 p.m.

In just a matter of months, Harmon Gill went from not knowing a lot about moot court competitions to co-founding USC’s chapter and leading a team to qualify for national tournaments. 
The Southern California Moot Court, founded in Fall 2019, has already accomplished many feats, such as two 3rd place finishes at the American Moot Court Association National Tournament. In addition to the skills and experiences that SCMC provides its members as undergraduates, students can now also participate in SCMC while earning college credit through the new WRIT 340 moot court section and a writing elective WRIT 499 “Practical Argumentation.” Thanks to writing deparment Professor Antonio Elefano, students can earn credit for a required writing class, while representing USC in competition at the same time.
“Universities exist to support students so when students formed this organization they built it from the ground up and then they raised it to greatness,” Elefano said. “I viewed it as my responsibility and USC’s responsibility to support it.”
While Elefano’s former students were busy preparing for their 2020 tournament season, he went to the writing program curriculum committee with a pitch.
“I teach legal writing classes at USC,” Elefano said. “The principles of moot court are exactly the same skills that I teach in my legal writing classes already. The only [differences are] that in my legal writing classes that I currently teach right now, I make up the fact patterns, and I choose the case law.”
The fairly new organization has grown significantly from its founding four members to a current team of 24. Vibhav Laud, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, placed second best speaker overall in the Western Region out of 60 speakers. Laud and his partner also made it to the American Moot Court Association National Tournament where they lost to the No. 1 seed in the sweet 16.
Trojans avenged fellow Trojans in that tournament where Gill, a senior majoring in communications, placed 3rd in the nation for the second year in a row. Gill had planned to not compete and solely serve as a leader and coach, but when another member could not compete at the last minute, Gill stepped in. 
“That’s the only way leadership works, you have got to put the ego aside … this is bigger than me. This is about teaching, and imparting a set of skills, giving folks a toolbox to be able to learn about the law,” Gill said. “That is far too important, and I am invested in making sure [that] the organization is right and we have the structures in place, the curriculum in place, and everything else right to support our organization. I hope this tradition of excellence continues on for years to come.” 
Gill said he believes in the importance of making sure SCMC is a part of USC for good as he considers it to be one of the best opportunities for pre-law students. According to their website,  moot court provides students an edge in law school admissions, law school, legal practice and even public speaking and legal advocacy.
“We teach you how to think like a lawyer, how to write like a lawyer and how to argue like a lawyer,” Gill said. “We teach you how to analyze a legal problem and how to pick apart arguments … from writing the actual legal brief to training for oral argument we teach you how to be an effective advocate in front of a panel of judges.”
SCMC is not only for pre-law students — many students of varying majors and career plans have participated. SCMC Secretary Maya Fransz-Myers, a senior majoring in political economy, said she isn’t planning to go to law school.
“I think it is ironic because I am a part of so many pre-law organizations …  but I am actually not planning to go to law school, at least not immediately,” Fransz-Myers said.
Regardless of your current major or future goals, Moot Court teaches invaluable skills that are useful to anybody, she said.
“I would say it is for everybody … everyone can benefit from public speaking and you would be surprised how the skills acquired in Moot Court translate to almost every aspect in your life,” Fransz-Myers said.
As agreed upon by Laud and Fransz-Myers, one of the best parts of SCMC are the new friends and memories they made through the club. 
“It sounds cliche, but I think my favorite thing is the friends I’ve made in moot court,” Fransz-Myers said. “As a senior looking back now, moot court was where I really met a lot of people that I talked to consistently.”

Our parents had Picassos, and we have the Nyan Cat. 
For those who are not well-versed in memes, “Nyan Cat” is an old-school viral video from 2011 with 185 million views on Youtube. The video is three minutes and thirty seven seconds of an animated cat with a pop-tart body flying through outer space, farting a rainbow that streaks the starry sky behind it as a high-pitched voice sings the words “nyan nyan nyan” in the background. 
While you may not agree that this piece is worthy of being dubbed as high art, it was recently sold for roughly $600,000. 
I’ve seen people all over the internet meet this price tag with hesitation, claiming that it is foolish to pay exorbitant prices for something that can already be accessed for free via the internet. 
The key to the value of these cultural artifacts is authenticity. The Mona Lisa can be accessed for free via the internet by all, yet ownership of the authentic original still maintains a high value. This is because there are ways that we can authenticate the Mona Lisa as a painting that was created by Leonardo Da Vinci likely around 1503. And now, there are ways to authenticate that the $600,000 digital file containing the Nyan Cat video was the one created by Chris Torres in 2011. 
The process of authenticating a digital file is commonly referred to as “minting.” More specifically, it is the process of creating a non-fungible token, or an NFT. To mint a file, creators simply need to upload their file to a minting platform and follow the steps from there. There are various types of minting platforms ranging from ones accessible to all, like Rarible and Opensea, as well as more exclusive ones that require membership on the platform, like SuperRare. Once a creator mints their file, an NFT is created.
An NFT is a type of digital asset that is entirely unique from any other digital file. No two NFTs are the same. These one-of-one tokens are hosted on a blockchain network. The blockchain network affords this asset with the ability to be traced down the chain of ownership all the way back to the original creator. 
This technology has opened the door to an entire marketplace for rare digital collectibles that can now be reliably verified and authenticated. A popular example of the explosive potential for this market is NBA Topshot, an NFT collection of minted sports-highlights that has generated over $205 million in less than six months.        
The ramifications of this kind of technology are innumerable, but sitting pretty at the top of this long list for all of us Reddit browsers, TikTok dwellers and Vine veterans are the consequences this technology has on memes. 
We could never own memes before. They were digital files born and bred on the internet, and until NFTs officially entered the chat, they could not be authenticated. They existed equally on everyone’s devices. Now, the original meme file can be minted by its creator and reign supreme as the real version (though copies of the file can still circulate the internet infinitely). 
I wonder what ramifications the potential for ownership of memes will have on internet culture. On the one hand, I am excited at the idea of meme creators getting compensated for their contributions to popular culture. Memes have definitely improved my life more than any million dollar Banksy piece has. I’d love to see the art market reflect and reward that value. 
On the other hand, we saw the profession title of “influencer” rot the internet from the inside out. 
Platforms that used to be reserved for non-monetizable, authentic and creative expression in the golden age of the internet quickly became fronts for influencer merch brands and kid-friendly corporate sponsorships (@ YouTube) in the span of the 10 years, after becoming viable sources of income for creators. Will the potential professional title of “meme artist” similarly rot meme culture from the inside out over the next 10 years? 
Moreover, now that there’s potentially real money on the line, are boomers and big time establishments going to invade and corrupt happy-fun memeland? 
Regardless of what lies in the future of the beloved meme, the fact is significant value exists in its present moment. Being meme savvy made some Reddit users a few dollars during the now-famous Gamestop short-squeeze event earlier in January. Likewise, being meme-savvy might be able to make some people a few dollars on the emerging NFT market in the same way that being art-savvy has made people millions over the last few centuries.
This is not intended as a form of financial advice, but rather, a call to young readers to keep their eyes peeled for ways they can capitalize on any extensive knowledge they may have on meme-culture before the establishments do.   
The power of memes have already begun to be usurped by people who are not children of the internet. Mainstream news outlets like Bloomberg have been decoding the meme language used on r/Wallstreetbets, and memes have begun selling for $600,000 — far beyond the budget of most young memesters.
Pay attention to what’s going on in the memeworld, and capitalize on the leg up we have on the older generation. Remember, they merely adopted the meme. We were born in it, moulded by it.

Throughout history, newspapers have villainized social justice movements. There was a time where papers were run by wealthy white men, thus it made sense that the stories in the paper would be against movements supporting women’s suffrage, immigration rights and labor unions. Even today there is a clear bias — both intentional and unintentional — towards social justice. 
In regards to the history of news villainization, the women’s suffrage movement in the 19th century proved to be one of the most notable. Much of the coverage surrounding these women was negative and hostile, and the same can be said for the coverage surrounding Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement in the ’60s. In the 21st century, it may be easy to think that this cycle of delegitimizing movements and issues has stopped, but that is not the case. 
During the summer demonstrations of Black Lives Matter, the media coverage continued the cyclical norm of bad coverage. There was clear perpetuation of an elitist point of view, where some media outlets would opt to interview the people in power (senators, police officers, etc.) instead of the protesters on the ground. Media outlets also failed to frame BLM outside of the protests, since much of the coverage was on what happened on the streets rather than the overall message of the movement. 
Additionally, the focus on the small groups of violence served as a catalyst for the criminalization and delegitimization of the entire movement. Violence tended to be incited by small groups or police and their blunt force during the peaceful demonstrations; however, most outlets equated all the violence and suggested that it was a result of BLM. 
Not only do these practices delegitimize an important movement that is raising key issues, they continue a cycle of antagonization of movements that has been present throughout the history of journalism.
This cycle also goes beyond movement and tends to be common practice when covering social justice issues in general. For example, during the mass migration movements from East Europe in the 19th century, media outlets perpetuated anti-immigrant language in their papers that reinforced stereotypes of these groups. Today, a similar practice of language is used to report police shootings of Black citizens. Instead of calling it for what it is, many outlets opt to use nuanced phrases like “officer-involved shooting” to protect the group in power and continue to dismiss this social justice issue of police brutality. 
Media outlets continue to create harmful narratives and delegitimize the message of social justice issues and mass movements. The first step in breaking this antiquated cycle is to recognize the harm done by journalists and recognize the problems in media practices in the past in order to point them out in coverage today. Only then will media outlets be able to produce accurate and ethical coverage. 
Journalism history can be taught through a formal education, such as the curriculum at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, or it could be self taught. This type of curriculum can mimic a course already taught at USC titled “Culture of Journalism: Past, Present and Future,” where the class began by looking at individual coverage of movements like women’s rights, immigration and labor union movements and analyzed how the media portrayed said groups. 
In addition to this structure, the curriculum could include a more immersive look at the specific language media outlets have used in the past and measure their impact on things like social justice; identifying these problems and patterns in history and today is the key to stopping them. 
It is also important to do this work at the school newspaper level. At the Daily Trojan, reporters should begin to pick out methods that antagonize social justice issues and movements and work to halt them, making it a norm for future journalists. This type of work can be done with the help of a diversity and inclusion department that leads training on media bias and journalism complicity in this villainization of social justice. 
Learning about these issues via an educational process and practice in the realm of student publications is the key to ensuring this cycle of villainization stops.

USC has partaken in the celebration of this year’s Black History Month through dozens of virtual events, showcasing a great variety of Black artists, educators, performers, researchers and more. These wildly talented guests have graced USC’s student body with their knowledge and experience, and Kevin Young is no exception.
On Feb. 26, Visions and Voices hosted Young, author and editor of several books such as the award-winning anthology, “African American Poetry: 250 Years of Struggle & Song,” poetry editor of The New Yorker, museum director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, among other things.
In this particular event, President Carol Folt led the conversation alongside Los Angeles poet laureate professor Robin Coste Lewis. The trio held a lively energy that centered around a topic generally associated with calm and sophistication: poetry. Their discussion showed that there is no one way to categorize the art form, except, as Folt pointed out, “When you hear those beautiful spoken words, it’s hard to not to begin to feel some enormous feeling of joy and purpose.” 
When Young reads poems aloud, it’s no doubt that his purpose is being fulfilled. As he reads, he is like a vessel for the poem to channel through. The meaning seems to seep through his hand gestures, mesmerizing gaze and flowing voice.
 The first poem read by Young was Langston Hughes’ “The Negro Speaks of Rivers.” The soulful poem speaks volumes and could only be followed by Young’s own poem honoring the legendary Hughes, which ends with “Langston, Langston, Langston Hughes, won’t you send all heaven’s news.” 
As evident in his leadership position in the National Museum of African American History and Culture, merging history with modern miracle is one of Young’s most unique talents. He said Hughes was a prominent part of his past before he even knew it, and, as he grew older, Young found that Hughes’ description of his early life in Kansas was akin to his own. 
Young sums up his point by asserting that with age, “You start to see all the matrix of what you become.” This full-circle moment is poetic in and of itself, and shows up again with Lewis.
Folt asked Lewis about her long-lasting friendship with Young, and Lewis brought the audience back in time to her entryway into the poetry world. Lewis had been creatively writing for years, but the start of her legitimization of the hobby began when a friend gifted her some of Young’s poetry books.
It shocked her that a different kind of poetry than she had been taught in school existed — something that could blend together history and culture in an “aesthetic verve.” She recalled the joy in discovering “my history, the history of the great migration West, philosophical inquiry … archaeology and the ancient world” could be crafted into poems. 
Never would Lewis have imagined that she and Young would be lifetime friends, nor that her work would be featured in his anthology. It is remarkable, but not surprising, that the poet’s life would reflect that same sense of magic that is interlaced in good poetry.
Recently that same magic is beginning to show itself to the public more and more, and Young declares that “we are in the midst of a renaissance.” Folt mentioned the rise of Amanda Gorman’s influence, a national youth poet laureate who performed at the presidential inauguration and Superbowl LV, and asked, “What do we do to support this and use this to change the underlying societal structures that need to go along to see this renaissance?”
Young’s answer to this massive question comes quickly as though he needed no time to consider, and the universal truth he reveals is as simple and exquisite as his poems. “Poetry has been saying this for a while: Pay attention, look, listen. These are the important things,” Young said. 
USC Students have already been poetry’s call to action, from extraordinary work created in writing programs to abundant student-led literary societies and foundations. Lewis noted that during the pandemic, “poetry books have been flying off the shelf this year.” Now more than ever, youth are using poetry to make sense of the world around them, just as Young advised.
In today’s renaissance, Black voices should be at the forefront. After centuries of racism-based censorship, it is long past due for these lives to be given the world’s attention.
As Young points out, “[Poets] remind us that we are in a precedented time as well as an unprecedented one.” 
There can be no celebration of the present or dreams of the future without sincere recognition of the past, and both Kevin Young and Robin Coste Lewis encourage this effort to be headed by today’s youth. Black History Month may be coming to a close, but the stories of Black experience must continue to be shared across USC’s campus and beyond.

A close knit family, loving dog and modest home in the greater Los Angeles area — “Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry” gives viewers an intimate glimpse into the 19-year-old superstar’s real world.
In her new documentary released Feb. 26, Eilish reveals the more simple side of her life that led to her ultimate rise to stardom. From her brother, Finneas’s, small, makeshift bedroom studio to the biggest stage at Coachella, Eilish has consistently stayed authentic to herself.
And if you are looking for an insane, glamorous tell-all into the life of the singer, this documentary is not it. Instead it focuses on the simplicity of the life Eilish still (sort of) maintains. 
With the support of her parents and her brother, Eilish’s life has remained somewhat grounded and normal. Her parents worry about her when she drives away alone for the first time, and they come into her bedroom while she sleeps to tell her she has been nominated for six Grammys. Through all the fame and success, they still remain the parents of a 19-year-old. There is a power in the mundane things that remain at  the core of Eilish’s life and that are highlighted extremely well in this documentary.
The majority of the film follows Eilish and Finneas as they create her Grammy award-winning album “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” Viewers get an inside look into their creative process, Eilish on the bed singing her iconic soft-spoken vocals while Finneas plays the songs and edits the lyrics when needed.
Early on into the film we see the struggle Eilish feels with her newfound fame. Her love of music and a majority of her songs come from a deep, dark place that she feels only certain people will connect and have access to. 
So now what does she do when her label, Interscope Records, tells her to write a hit that is “accessible?” Finneas, standing in his childhood kitchen, explains “I feel like I’ve been, told to write a hit, but I’ve been told to not tell Billie that we have to write a hit.” 
This is the tug-of-war that is a reality for most young stars — finding the balance between having a childhood, creating music and managing stardom. 
Though Eilish ultimately goes on to write all those hits, without the protection of her brother, she might not be able to go about her creative processes the way she wanted to.
A highlighted figure in the documentary, besides her family members, is Justin Bieber. Eilish explains her love for Bieber during his rise to superstardom, as most 12-year-old girls probably could. 
Bieber represents the teen-star who became ultra-famous and then makes a few mistakes. He serves as almost a juxtaposition to the way Eilish is navigating her rise to fame. A figure who was once an unknown figment, Bieber is now a close friend to Eilish, collaborating with her and calling her to congratulate her on her 2020 Grammy sweep. 
With no narration and no narrative plot structure, this documentary easily could have felt misdone or uncompleted. However, the simple qualities of the film made it all the more tender, heartfelt and real. Not overly produced or edited, the film’s shaky camera work at times and intimate subject matter bring you closer to the very private star. 
Toward the end of the documentary, they show the start of her worldwide tour and the struggles that come with that lifestyle. 
Eilish’s concerts involve crazy dancing and jumping that make a larger-than-life performance seem incredibly intimate. But with that kind of movement comes injury. Eilish deals with the strains on her body in a graceful way and only wants to get back on the stage to continue her shows. As the film comes to a close we reach the climax of her career thus far, a combined six Grammys won by EIlish and Finneas. 
Eilish does what she loves — she does it for her fans and for herself. Her mother, father and brother are still heavily intertwined in Eilish’s journey. Now we get a chance to see what it takes for a teen popstar to try and continue to live their life as normally as possible.
While Eilish’s life in the spotlight is only beginning, there is hopeful light shining on her future. Everyone knows what can happen when someone becomes famous too young — Bieber being a prime example in the documentary. The outside world sees her music, dark and twisty, and easily labels her the same way. And although some of those parts may be true, the Eilish shown in the documentary loves to laugh, loves to perform and loves the people in her life.

The first ten minutes of Netflix’s new drama series “Ginny & Georgia” seem like a “Gilmore Girls” Freudian slip: a fun-loving young mom and her bookish, responsible best friend/daughter deal with boy trouble and family drama in a picturesque New England small town … but with a  lot more sex and death.
“Ginny and Georgia” is a dark, unpredictable story that feels more like a crime series than a “Gilmore” reboot. If the simple charm of Stars Hollow was too good to be true, then the secretive, back-stabbing Wellsbury is too crazy to be true.
“Ginny and Georgia” follows 30-year-old single mom Georgia (Brianne Howey) as she moves her two kids, mature yet angsty teen Ginny (Antonia Gentry) and Harry Potter-loving Austin (Diesel La Torraca), to Wellsbury, Mass. after the death of her husband. Ginny gets caught up in modern teenage life, the previously shy 15-year-old suddenly thrust into the world of drugs, sex, partying and high school. Georgia has to balance being a mother and coming to terms with her broken, secretive past.
Netflix certainly didn’t do themselves any favors with the desperate attempt to modernize  “Gilmore Girls,” especially when the show is already trying to do way too much. If they wanted to remake “Gilmore Girls,” why not just bring back the actual Gilmore girls? If they didn’t push the mother-daughter relationship so much, perhaps the show would be less disappointing. 
Aside from a couple of cheeky moments and stereotypical fights, Ginny and Georgia are both wrapped up in way too many storylines for the show to actually be about them. 
The show truly has potential, but so far, it’s just trying to do too much. Every important topic brought up gets buried beneath subplot after subplot, and no single storyline sticks as a new one is brought up in just about every scene.
Issues like racism, feminism, mental health, self-harm, body image, sexuality, bullying, drugs, cancer, class dynamics and financial struggle all come up just in the first three episodes, yet none play central roles in the story. While it’s great that the show tries to center issues teenagers are dealing with today, it does little more than scratch the surface on one before moving on to another. Nothing happens and everything happens at the same time.  
The show is strongest when it’s focused on Ginny, a very dynamic, very relatable 15-year-old learning to manage everything from peer pressure to her biracial identity. In no small part due to Gentry’s compelling performance, Ginny shines among the scattered storylines. Her storylines are often a perfect blend of light-hearted comedy and powerful drama. The show could have been great if it committed to just being “Ginny” instead of trying to be “Ginny and Georgia” and 300 Other Things.  
Georgia, the supposed irresistible, cool mom, is more of an Al Capone-type hiding under an Elle Woods exterior.
In the first three episodes, she seems to do little more than steal, cheat and lie. Instead of growing into a better person and a more complex character, Georgia becomes more shallow and deplorable as the show progresses. Despite Howey’s talent, the disconnect between loving mother and criminal mastermind is just awkward to watch. The character’s few moments of emotional truth are drowned in hypersexualization and scandal; at times it’s unclear whether we are supposed to sympathize with her or hate her. 
The countless side characters are charming and dynamic, if not helpful to the story. Georgia’s nine-year-old son Austin is heartwarming and adorable; the show is honestly worth watching just for his few scenes. Ginny’s lesbian best friend Maxine (wittily played by Sara Waisglass) is funny and quirky. Flashbacks to teenage Georgia (a vulnerable Nikki Roumel) are interesting but seem like an excuse for grown-up Georgia’s lack of depth. 
And then there are the boys.
In a show with two women leads and an all-women creative team, I had hoped they could manage to stay away from instant love triangles and will-they-won’t-they relationships. Of course, Ginny has to be caught between deep bad-boy Marcus and wholesome, respectful Hunter (sound familiar?). Georgia has her own triangle between local café owner Joe and her boss  Mayor Paul Randolph. The double romances are forced and unnecessary. With so much already going on, I wish the focus was more on the women than their love lives.  
“Ginny & Georgia” could be a sweet mother-daughter show, a captivating teenage drama, or a binge-worthy scandal series; it just needs to stop trying to be all of those.
It’s worth watching for the loveable characters and interesting ideas, even though they are diluted by half-developed storylines. If Netflix decides to make a second season, I’m sure “Ginny & Georgia” will find its footing, but, if it were up to me, I would really like to find out who the father of Rory’s baby on “Gilmore Girls” is instead.

Producer Danny L Harle has never been a fan of minimalism. This has never been truer than on his debut album “Harlecore,” a high-concept, euphoric trip to an alternate dimension where dance music reigns and a bouncy blue man with big white eyes does DJ sets surrounded by floating springs.
The bouncy blue man in question — MC Boing — is one of four resident DJs in Harle’s fictional night club, Club Harlecore. Alongside “Harlecore’s” release, Harle debuted an interactive website that allows fans to enter Club Harlecore and watch each of its resident DJs perform songs from the album. The rest of Club Harlecore’s cast is made up of a giant green jellyfish (DJ Ocean), a destructive fiery canine (DJ Mayhem) and Harle’s own DJ persona, shown on the album cover as a metallic maestro at the front of the whole project (DJ Danny).
In addition to being present in the album art, music videos and on the interactive Club Harlecore site, each of these four fictional DJs is credited alongside Harle in the album’s tracklist. While the credited DJ on a given song helps signify some of Harle’s collaborators, this tactic also effectively breaks up the tracklist into four subcategories.
Harle is a founding member of London-based record label and music collective PC Music, a label that, since its inception in 2013, has garnered attention for its hyper-glossy, futuristic take on pop music that exaggerates pop tropes to their extreme. While Harle’s PC Music peers like A.G. Cook and the late SOPHIE seek to push pop to its limit, Harle instead marries the experimentalism of PC Music with elements of more mainstream dance music, also pulling influences from dance sub-genres like ’90s rave and Eurodance.
While the concept and influences behind “Harlecore” are complex, its mission is simple: to provide the most transcendent, blissful listening experience possible. And for the most part, it achieves this goal — even if the high ultimately wears off.
“Harlecore’s” greatest strength lies in its singles. Although the album missteps slightly with opener “Where Are You Now,” a high-energy but unremarkable dance cut that feels watered-down by Harle’s standards, it recovers with the following four tracks: all released before the album and each spotlighting a different one of Club Harlecore’s DJ personas.
The first, “Boing Beat,” is a much more worthy album opener than its predecessor. In just one minute and 33 seconds, “Boing Beat” combines the fictional MC Boing’s grating, Crazy-Frog-esque chants with PC Music staple Hannah Diamond’s pristine and angelic vocal melodies. It’s a disorienting experience, but that’s intentional: Harle throws conflicting elements together and shakes them up until they explode in your face.
Harle continues strong with “Interlocked,” which starts as a glittery pop tune and morphs into a bass-heavy banger. If Club Harlecore was a real place, “Interlocked” would have the building supports shaking.
“Ocean’s Theme” is an ambient siren song and nice change of pace featuring enchanting vocals from frequent Harle collaborator Caroline Polachek. “On A Mountain,” the album’s lead single, is a euphoric dance anthem about finding someone else who is just as heartbroken as you: “We can lay here on a mountain, me and you / Can you feel it? This is something new / I can see your heart’s been broken too.”
All four tracks are enveloping and transportive, carrying the listener further into Harle’s surreal world and showcasing just how versatile Harle is.
Here, however, is where “Harlecore” begins to falter.
While none of the remaining tracks are bad, most don’t bring anything truly new or exciting to the table. Apart from the particularly PC-Music-inspired “All Night” and the anthemic “Take My Heart Away,” the album stays frustratingly within the sonic realm established by its singles. Although cycling through sounds and DJ personas makes the album’s first leg exhilarating, Harle shows his cards a bit too quickly.
“Piano Song” and “Car Song” harken back to the delectable chaos of “Boing Beat” but fall short by comparison, especially since the novelty of MC Boing’s bizarre delivery has worn off. “Do You Remember” and “Shining Stars” are fun but empty. Harle takes all his risks right off the bat then doesn’t dare to venture further.
But even if “Harlecore’s” magic wears off before its run time is over, it’s hard to fault an album that has so much fun along the way. Harle doesn’t take himself too seriously — for proof, look no further than his brief, cheeky tweets.
Lyrics are simple and repetitive, their primary purpose being to accompany Harle’s intricate production. Sentiments never get much deeper than “I want you all night” or “‘Cause we’re shining stars tonight,” but they don’t need to. “Harlecore” is here to capture the in-the-moment feeling of a night on the dance floor and transport listeners into Harle’s fantasy.
So although our legs start to get tired by the end of the night, “Harlecore’s” commitment to escapism and its immersive universe is enough to keep us dancing through it all.

Cathy Park Hong’s newest book, “Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning,” was released in Feb. 2020. It is very likely you have not heard of it.
Despite 2020 being popularly characterized as the United States’s year of “racial reckoning,” Hong’s book received little fanfare outside of Asian America. Hong was not invited to speak on The New York Times Book Review’s podcast. I have yet to hear or see a single person, again — except for a few Asian Americans — recommend, refer to, or even demonstrate that they are aware of the book’s existence. 
This is one of the reasons “Minor Feelings” is so painfully essential today. During the United States’ supposed year of “racial reckoning,” Hong’s book, and the dearth of attention it has received from non-Asian America, offers a treatise on the country’s galling ignorance and shows how far the nation still has to go before it ever approaches anything resembling a true, “racial reckoning.” 
The book is an amalgam of literary forms and genres — part cultural criticism, part memoir and part history. One could also accurately consider it a collection of essays. Chapter to chapter, Hong tackles a myriad of topics, from personal subjects such as her family and upbringing in Koreatown, her life in college and her experiences as an Asian American poet and professor, to historical and cultural subjects such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Hollywood’s centuries-long tradition of dehumanizing minority groups and the consequences of American imperialism and exploitation overseas. 
Clearly, what Hong chooses to address in “Minor Feelings’’ is diverse and at times, seemingly disparate.  However, Hong deftly manages and transitions between the scores of subjects she addresses in a way that is not only illuminating, but also sincerely beautiful to read.
Still, it is not only Hong’s command of prose that unifies “Minor Feelings,” it is how Hong captures, in a form that is haltingly unapologetic and redemptively accurate, what it often means to be Asian American. 
“You don’t like how you look, how you sound,” Hong writes. “You think your Asian features are undefined, like God started pinching out your features and then abandoned you. You hate that there are so many Asians in the room. Who let in all the Asians? You rant in your head.”
To be Asian American, Hong explains, is to inhabit a “vague purgatorial status.” It is to be “distrusted by African Americans, ignored by whites, unless we’re being used by whites to keep the Black man down.” It is to be conditioned by society to believe that your features are inherently undesirable, to be taught your ancestors’ history is only relevant when they’re being shot or bombed by Americans and to scream into an empty void that you are in pain — a pain built, as Hong puts it, from “the sediments of everyday racial experience and the irritant of having one’s perception of reality constantly questioned or dismissed,” — only to be met by a deafening silence.
Hong is also unrelentingly clear-eyed in her evisceration of the lies, traps and societal cages that have long-stymied her voice, and Asian American voices like it, from being heard.
“The indignity of being Asian in this country has been underreported,” Hong writes. “We have been cowed by the lie that we have it good. We keep our heads down and work hard, believing that our diligence will reward us with our dignity, but our diligence will only make us disappear […] the lie that Asians have it good is so insidious that even now as I write, I’m shadowed by doubt that I didn’t have it bad compared to others. But racial trauma is not a competitive sport.”
However, if racial trauma is doomed to remain one by the societal forces that be, “Minor Feelings” makes clear that it is past time America recognizes that Asian Americans are at the very least, on the scoreboard. What with the 19th century anti-Chinese campaigns in which Chinese immigrants couldn’t even leave their homes without being “spat at, clubbed […] shot in the back” or lynched; violence and hate crimes that persist and increase to this day, and both a society and popular culture that has engendered crippling, unconscious self-contempt within innumerable Asian Americans. 
It is in this context that “Minor Feelings” is a radicalizing experience. Hong’s book gives a language to the ostracization, self-hatred and unheard rage of many in the Asian American community, but it does so without falling victim to self-flagellation or fetishizing the suffering. Instead, Hong’s book is freeing in many respects, because to read and have articulated one’s lived experience is not necessarily to be weighed down by it, but, as in the case of “Minor Feelings,” it is to be liberated from it.

The Zoom webinar bubbled with excitement as the USC Concerts Committee and Black Student Assembly introduced the star-studded panelists for “Soul, Stars and Success: The Motown Story,” on Feb. 26. 
The event featured prolific speakers from across the music industry. President of Motown Records and Executive Vice President of Capitol Music Group Ethiopia Habtemariam, Motown Records recording artist Asiahn and executives from the label, management and publishing company,  Since the 80s, appeared as featured panelists. 
Taj Mayfield, a junior majoring in journalism, moderated the event and began by introducing Debra Lee, former chief executive officer of BET Networks. Lee introduced the Quinn Coleman Memorial Fund, a collaboration with the GRAMMY Museum to raise money to fund internships and uplift up and coming executives of color, which is in honor of her son who passed away last August. Coleman was an executive and DJ with a passion for music. 
“Soul, Stars and Success: The Motown Story” was the first official function to raise money for the effort. Donating to the fund entered attendees into a raffle where they could win two tickets to the inaugural Black Music Collective Grammy Week Event, an Echo Dot, an Amazon gift card or a one on one with Universal Music Group’s °1824 providing tips on getting into the music industry. 
Themes of entrepreneurship underpinned the conversation throughout the evening.
In the face of a changing music landscape where streaming became the status quo, Habtemariam stressed the importance of returning to the values Motown started with. 
“So it was about artist development, which is something all of us on this panel believe in, but also was about supporting other entrepreneurs that lived and breathed in the same spirit of what Berry Gordy created back then,” Habtemariam said.
Later in the night she highlighted the significance of work ethic for people in the music industry in any capacity.
“You will be surprised,” Habtemariam said. “Some of the biggest superstars, the ones that really reach a certain level of success, the work ethic is so incredible. And so, in order to make it whether it’s as an artist as a creator or as an executive as an entrepreneur. Your work ethic is everything.”
Asiahn demonstrated this spirit of work ethic as she described her experience making her first project, her debut EP “Love Train.”  
“I recorded my entire project, my first one and [most of my second one] in my house, by myself,” Asiahn said.
She described the process of having her producer send her some tracks and recorded, mixed, did all of her photoshoots by herself. 
Another focus of the night was maintaining integrity. Asiahn described her experience releasing her own music after being more behind the scenes as a songwriter for other acts. 
“I released ‘Love Train,’ my EP, first by myself just to see if I had a place in music coming from the perspective of a Black LGBTQ artist,” Asiahn said.
Asiahn provided a moment of levity when she addressed how important it is to stay true to yourself and not follow trends just because they are popular. 
“I find that you know, I’m not the biggest TikToker,” Asiahn said. “I’m not finna do all them dances. I can try, but I might look like a fool. Like I tried to do the Megan one, but I don’t got Megan knees. So that didn’t work for me.
Asiahn continued on to stress that regardless of your message, someone, somewhere will appreciate what you have to say. 
“I just know what stories I want to tell. I tell the stories I feel like music is missing. And to be true to yourself and tell your own stories you have to know that there’s billions of people in the world, and so somebody is going to resonate with what you have to say.” 
She continued saying “Don’t try to follow the trends, don’t try to follow what everyone else is doing. Know who you are and stick with that. And be unapologetic about it. Be authentic about it.”
Another memorable moment during the conversation were the panelists’, in particular Since the 80s, response to feelings of imposter syndrome.
Barry Johnson and Zekiel Nicholson, two of three founders of the label, management and publishing company, Since the 80s, claimed their environment ensured they were aware of their talents and worth. 
“What’s that?” Johnson said.
“We’re around family at the end of the day. So at no point in our progression as a label or as executives [have I] felt that sense of imposter syndrome personally,” Nicholson said. 
Johnson continued that working with other Black creators created a comfortable environment where he didn’t feel inadequate. 
Habtemariam said her experience becoming president of Motown Records was the only time she had to reckon with imposter syndrome. As president, Habtemariam would find herself as the only Black person at a table of executives and would have to shoulder the responsibility of representing and speaking for not only herself, but a community of people, leading her to wonder if she was capable of it. 
She credited having the responsibility to pave the way for other executives of color for breaking her out of that mindset.
“There were times where it was a little [heavy] for me,” Habtemariam said. “And then I was like, oh no, this is a bigger mission, this is a bigger purpose. Because if I’m the only one in the room, I got to make sure there are more of us in the room. I got to make sure that this never happens again where you feel like you have to convince people [of the] value of our music or the talent that comes from the space that we’re from or people that look like me.”

How do we remember athletes? The past half century provides endless films of their grace, their hustle and their words, but a legacy isn’t encapsulated in their TV record. I’ll give you one example to start: how we, or at least I, remember Kobe Bryant. 
I watch the goosebump-inducing short film Dear Basketball, narrated off a poem Bryant wrote in The Players’ Tribune before his last season. With its beautiful animation overlaid by Bryant’s soft goodbye to the sport he loved, the film won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film in 2018.
It’s the realest documentation we have of the late, great athlete, more than all the highlight reels and game tapes combined. Sound like a radical statement? Watch the film again. No viewer can turn off the screen without feeling the journey of a dream-ridden kid to a worn-down legend. That’s why it won the Oscar, and is exactly what sports media should continue to move towards. 
When the pandemic stripped the world of day-to-day sports action, sports media distributors immediately turned to the backlog of documentaries they have and gave sports fanatics at least something they could snack on. March started out rough for this audience, but then came “The Last Dance.”
Labeled the saving grace of the sports quarantine period, the 10-part Michael Jordan series drew in record-breaking viewership that expanded beyond the typical sports fanatic. My family became one of the five million households that put its two-episode premieres on our sacred Sunday docket. We watched what felt like in real time the GOAT struggle to rally his team to win a sixth championship, and my parents got to relive the glory of 90’s basketball. 
I’ll save the synopsis for your own Wikipedia search, but the most astounding thing about this docuseries’ storyline reflects Bryant’s five-minute masterpiece: it’s just about basketball.
To be more specific, it’s about the story of basketball, yet the point of the media’s ability to reach mass audiences remains the same. No broader political or social issue was addressed to rope in interest — it was the simple triumph and tragedy of the game itself that managed to make the series a cultural phenomena. 
Welcome to the age of the cinematic sports documentary. Sorry 30 for 30, I’m not talking about you, but good run nonetheless. These types of film go beyond the reverent highlight reels and make sports a human-centered story anyone can follow. They are not made for the walking sports encyclopedias, but they do not miss out on the significance of certain moments throughout certain games. 
“The Last Dance” wasn’t an intense study of basketball’s greatest team. It was the story of the characters who somehow had to come together to earn that title with Jordan at the center. Through the ingenious interview technique where Jordan himself viewed other interview subjects’ footage, we got real reactions that showed a glimpse of the grudges he held. We took it as personally as Jordan did, and that’s the beauty of this type of dive into the reality of sports. 
I wouldn’t say it’s “muck-racking” investigative work. Rather, it’s an instructive piece of sports media with a storyline meant for broader audiences. 
In an age where live sports coverage has invaded every centimeter of live game coverage from the locker room to the mic’d up sidelines, sports documentaries and cinematic pieces still provide a realer sense of athletes themselves. Filmmakers can take time with their subjects and with the vast archive of such documentation of athletes and reinvent the narrative beyond the day-to-day headlines. 
The result is something more real than what a game recap can offer. The audience’s takeaway feels more real than any locker room photo or sideline banter could offer. Our sports legends become demystified and accessible.
Streaming giants are taking note and are funding more and more cinematic sports content. Brazil’s football giant Pelé has his own Netflix documentary exploring the complexity of his non political stance during the 1960s. Other documentaries such as “Athlete A” and “Icarus” explore how the politics of Olympic-level athletes ultimately endanger their health and are also available on the streaming giant. Even “Tiger,” which I wrote about in my last column, exemplifies the caliber of sports storytelling that defines an athlete’s legacy. 
If sports media is going to survive in the age of streaming, it must challenge itself to dig for the stories behind the scoreboards. Cinematic appeal takes time, but it’s necessary to attract new audiences.

The Trojans fell on the road 71-61 to Utah Saturday night — a stark contrast to their dominant win over the Utes in January. 
In their prior matchup, USC led by just four points at halftime before hounding Utah defensively, holding them to 18 points in the second half in the 64-46 win. 
It was a similar story with a completely different ending for the Trojans. After leading by two points at the interval, USC came out of the locker room looking flat, connecting on just one of their first 13 field goal attempts. The Utes immediately rattled off an 8-0 run to start the second period, a trend that would continue to the final buzzer. 
“Very disappointed in our second half of basketball,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “It was our worst half probably all season.”
Not many positives can be drawn from this loss to a Utah team that was riding four-straight losses coming in. USC’s starting five combined to shoot just over 31% from the field against the Utes, who are currently a sub .500 team. 
The offensive side of the basketball has been the biggest question mark for this Trojan squad all season. Against Utah on Jan. 2, freshman forward Evan Mobley put up three points without attempting a single shot throughout the game. In USC’s second meeting against the Utes, Mobley finished with just 11 points going 2-7 from the field, numbers far below the star’s average. 
Mobley’s scoring in the post and unique agility make him an important asset to this team’s offense, but such contributions disappeared for stretches throughout the game. As a force down low able to get easy buckets, this USC squad goes as far as Mobley takes them. 
With Mobley’s offensive faltering, the Trojans forced kickouts to perimeter players. Against a Utes team that was shooting 60% from behind the arc, USC stood no chance of winning the 3-point matchup. The Trojans currently rank No. 10 in the Pac-12 in both 3-point attempts and 3-pointers made.
When the Trojans were in need of someone to take the reins and drag them back into the game, junior guard Drew Peterson did his best to steady the ship. He put up a team-high 19 points going 8-15, but it wasn’t enough to combat the team’s overall horrid shooting and lackluster ball handling with 13 turnovers. 
“You just have to play better. There’s no excuses,” Enfield said. “If you want to win Pac-12 games on the road, you can’t play like that. It’s not efficient basketball, and it’s not good enough.”
Despite the Trojans offensive woes throughout the season, they didn’t just stumble into a 19-6 record by chance. They earned it on the defensive side of the ball, boasting a top-20 field goal percentage defense in the NCAA. 
The disciplined, smothering defense fans are accustomed to seeing from Trojans was absent in the second half, as the Utes put up 44 points on 59% shooting and a scorching hot 7-9 from beyond the 3-point line on a number of uncontested looks. 
The Trojans held junior forward Timmy Allen to 2-14 shooting in their previous meeting, but Allen looked determined to prove that result as an outlier. He looked comfortable on the floor against USC, scoring 15 points while dishing out eight assists, dominating as a floor general through the second half. 
While three losses in four games would have put USC out of the race for a possible eighth conference title, UCLA’s 70-61 loss to Colorado keeps the Trojans alive. 
USC hosts Stanford at Galen on March 3. Tip-off is at 7:30 p.m. A win against the Cardinals coupled with a UCLA win against Oregon would result in a conference-title matchup on March 6.
