Special teams is one of many USC units turning the page from 2019. After the Trojans averaged the Pac-12’s third-fewest kickoff return yards and second-fewest punt return yards, ranked last in the country in kickoff return coverage and allowed two kickoff return touchdowns in 2019, special teams coordinator Mike Baxter was fired in late December. 
Enter Sean Snyder, who took over as special teams coordinator in February after 26 years in various positions at Kansas State and who is choosing to leave last season fully in the past.
“I came into this, and I didn’t really look in the rearview mirror, to be honest with you,” Snyder said in a virtual press conference Wednesday. “What I’ve done is I’ve come out and tried to just install me — install what I like to see and what I like to do … I didn’t want to have any preconceived notions of what any of the players in the past have done. I wanted to build it from scratch and give everybody an opportunity.”
Simplicity
Snyder outlined a straightforward approach for the special teams unit in 2020: Don’t drastically alter the game plan from week to week; make sure his players become comfortable with their individual roles. 
“There’s a lot of teams that will go out and every week will have a completely different scheme of what they’re trying to do,” Snyder said. “My goal is to be able to bend and mold what we’re doing to the teams that we’re playing against and keep the players in a position to where every day they’re doing the same thing.”
Snyder said he hasn’t yet determined his return specialists, mentioning that juniors wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and cornerback Olaijah Griffin as well as seniors tailback Stephen Carr and redshirt wide receiver Tyler Vaughns have all impressed in that role in camp. 
The first-year coach highlighted junior safeties Talanoa Hufanga and redshirt Isaiah Pola-Mao, sophomore cornerback Jayden Williams, redshirt sophomore safety Raymond Scott, redshirt freshman receiver Bru McCoy and sophomore receivers Drake London and John Jackson III as standouts in non-specialist roles. Snyder also said redshirt sophomore punter Ben Griffiths has “unlimited” potential.
“And there’s more,” Snyder said. “I’m missing guys. There’s quite a few guys that have really stepped up.” 
Snyder said he’ll try to limit starters to two special teams units and the most effective players will play regardless of their place on the depth chart. 
“I’m not married to a starter or a second stringer or a third stringer,” Snyder said. “I’m just gonna put the best guy out there that’s getting the job done the best way.”
The adjustment period
Snyder admitted that the lack of a spring camp has made it difficult for the unit to get its timing down. However, he said the group has made strides recently, growing more comfortable with the scheme’s fast pace.
“The effort’s been great, the attention the players have had with what we’re doing and what we’re trying to do — I mean, they want to be great at what they’re doing,” Snyder said. “That’s half the battle right there.”
Special teams isn’t the only group that underwent a coaching change over the offseason, and Snyder noted that many of his players have to adjust to a new defensive scheme led by coordinator Todd Orlando as well. 
That’s one reason Snyder said he tries to keep things simple. 
“I want to be fundamentally sound,” he said. “I want us to be able to go out there and execute at a fast pace and a high level. I don’t want guys to have to over-process and overthink things.” 
The core
Redshirts junior placekicker Chase McGrath and senior long snapper Damon Johnson — who Snyder together referred to as “staples” of the special teams’ efforts — also joined in the press conference Wednesday. 
McGrath said he got kicked off several fields outside of USC while training during quarantine, and Johnson said he and his father had to get creative to practice his craft, tying a tire to a tree branch as a target. 
Now, the two are back on the field together, looking to build on their rapport that led to McGrath hitting 14 of 17 field goal attempts and all 54 PATs last year.
“Honestly, it’s everything,” McGrath said of having a snapper as reliable and consistent as Johnson. “Since 2017 — actually, Damon, I don’t remember you ever giving me a bad snap on a field goal or anything. You’ve been nothing but perfect, man. Honestly, that makes the world of difference. My job is so much easier, because every single time, I know that the snap, hold will be there, like I don’t have to worry about it. All I need to do is just focus on my job.” 
McGrath won the Trojans’ Special Teams Player of the Year award in 2019, and Johnson isn’t afraid to claim at least some of that success.
“I feel like I’ve done a really good job of being consistent for Chase,” Johnson said. “I always say that if he’s having a good year, I like to take credit for it … With long snapping, you don’t really want to be in that limelight of being mentioned. I’ve been told that my whole career, basically. So I think I’ve done a pretty good job with that.”
An underrated facet
Special teams isn’t one of the most talked-about groups on a football team, especially when that team boasts the offensive firepower USC does. 
But it’s one that could flip a game’s momentum in the blink of an eye, and Snyder is looking for that impact from his group.
“My mentality is based on the fact that special teams has to be a part of the game,” Snyder said. “We should be able to have a big spark in the game to be able to trigger a big play.”

USC’s political science and international relations department plans to “decolonize” its curricula and include underrepresented voices through a newly formed syllabi review task force. The task force aims to create an informational hub with resources related to representation and inclusion in Spring 2021, professors from the department said in a virtual town hall meeting Monday. 
The task force and town hall itself came in response to demands made by Delta Phi Epsilon, USC’s foreign service society, in a letter addressed to the University’s POIR department over the summer. In the letter, DPE called on the department to diversify its syllabuses and faculty for the department’s education to more accurately reflect the current state of international politics and address historic inequalities within the discipline.
Art Auerbach, a professor of political science who represented the political science major at the town hall, said that in response to DPE’s concerns, POIR faculty have also attended the first of three mandatory anti-oppression trainings and have been asked to read and discuss scholarship on the discipline’s intersection with race and underserved communities. Additionally, a tenured position focused on race and ethnicity has been approved, with the department currently searching for someone to fill the role, he said. 
DPE President Charles Convery and External Vice President Natalia Parraz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that a few productive meetings have taken place between the organization and the POIR department since their letter this summer, but the town hall was the first public response to their demands. 
“I was definitely blown away after our first meeting on just how seriously they took our concerns and their honest efforts in implementing them,” Convery said. “I am worried that there’s more resistance perhaps under the surface, especially with other professors who maybe are not as agreeable in what they see as curriculum or what should be analyzed. Hopefully … we can make this kind of student-faculty collaboration become much more standardized and much more routine for the entire department.”
Despite the department’s work on the syllabi task force, student concerns on the curriculum’s lack of diversity remained. 
Ida Ghohestani, a sophomore majoring in international relations who is DPE’s membership vice president, asked about the department’s efforts to address the lack of regional focus on Central, South and Southeast Asia. Ghohestani also questioned the department’s grouping of the Middle East and Africa as one region. 
“A lot of these issues are because … we don’t have teachers [with backgrounds in these regions], and we’re looking for teachers, but I think another issue is why wasn’t POIR looking for these teachers before these concerns were raised?” Ghohestani said in an interview with the Daily Trojan following the meeting. “It’s very clear that the regional focus requirements just completely neglect so many different regions within the world … there’s so many different people within the student body not represented within the regional focuses.”
In response to Ghohestani’s question, Iva Bozovic, a professor of international relations, said the department does not have a scholar with expertise on Southeast Asia but has attempted to hire one for a “long time.” In regards to the issue of diverse hirings, Bozovic said, “When we say we’re trying to hire, it really means we’re trying. We’re making offers.”
Bozovic also said grouping the Middle East and North Africa is a standard designation used by many international organizations, such as the World Bank, for the regions’ cultural, economic and environmental similarities. 
Some students disagreed with this logic after the meeting, with Ghohestani calling the default grouping “extremely ridiculous.”
“Not only is combining the Middle East and Africa racist, it’s also bad IR. It’s bad academics,” Convery said. “We’re not gonna be prepared to go out and be international relations scholars or employees in various sectors and think of the Middle East and Africa as one giant conglomerate.” 
Robert Scalia, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said that he has had difficulty finding a professor with a research interest in Africa. He said that he has been repeatedly referred to one professor, who is currently on leave, and that he could only find one other professor with a listed research interest in Africa. 
Bozovic pointed Scalia toward a few faculty members such as assistant professor Megan Becker, who has studied civil war in Africa, and said that the department recognizes the importance of having classes for each region, even if it is not as many as they would prefer. 
“One of the other issues is that a lot of the professors that they pointed out that were doing research in Africa focused on conflict studies or something related to that,” Ghohestani said. “I think it maybe reinforces stereotypes, where the majority of IR classes, when we learn about conflict, when we learn about issues like that, it’s always in regards to the Middle East and Africa and Latin America.” 
Parraz also commented on the list of professors suggested to Scalia, adding that the majority of the professors mentioned were white. While lecturer Safia Farole, a woman of color, will teach “The Political Economy of Africa” this spring, Parraz said that the department needs to do more to focus on “who is teaching this material.”
“I think POIR is focusing on what they’re teaching right now, which is a great first step, but we need to focus, again, on who is teaching this material,” Parraz said. “Is it men, is it women, is it people from these countries, is it people of color, is it by [Black and Indigenous people and people of color?]” 
Parraz said that if the department struggles to hire more representative faculty, it could invite guest speakers with more diverse backgrounds and expertise to speak at panel discussions. She said DPE brings speakers from diverse organizations with global perspectives — such as a recent talk with Rhoda Robinson, the co-director of the Nigeria-based nonprofit HACEY — and the department should follow the same standard.
“If we can do it, they can do it. And it’s not our job, but because they aren’t, we have to because that’s what we want to study, that’s what we care about and we want to learn more,” Parraz said. “We’ve shown them what they can do, just by example, so I’m just waiting on them to pick up on it.”

USC football’s season kicks off in less than two weeks and as fall camp concludes, the role of the Trojans’ tight ends may expand. 
First-year tight ends coach John David Baker said his crew is ready to contribute.
“We’ve got a couple really talented tight ends in [senior] Erik [Krommenhoek] and [redshirt freshman] Jude [Wolfe] that have put themselves in position to be on the football field,” Baker said. 
Baker, who was part of North Texas’s Air Raid offense as an offensive quality coach, said the success of the tight ends during camp adds to USC’s potential to run an effective scheme. Baker said they’ve been standing out all throughout camp, making it difficult for the coaches to leave them off the field.  
An important part of the offense is Krommenhoek. At 6-foot-5, Krommenhoek creates mismatches all over the field, which allows USC to play at a faster pace, according to Baker.
Krommenhoek, who had 11 receptions last season, is excited to show off his skills as a pass-catcher. 
“We love being physical, we love lining up and running the ball and we’re going to need to do that to be successful this year,” Krommenhoek said. “That’s going to be an enhanced role in our offense and I’m excited.” 
Krommenhoek mentioned that he has been studying San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz, who attended the same high school as Krommenhoek in the Bay Area.
Krommenhoek said he spent the offseason training with Cleveland Browns tight end Austin Hooper. Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams even showed up to train one day. 
“We were just learning, throwing around, working out and I’m just trying to learn as much as I could and kind of get in some offseason work,” he said. “[Also] just kind of learning whatever I can to improve my route game and running game.”
Not only is Krommenhoek a potentially important receiver, but coaches consistently mentioned him as one of the team leaders in camp. 
“I think just trying to get people to do the best they can and be the best version of themselves is something I’m trying to bring out of everybody,” Krommenhoek said.
The Trojans will look to play at a faster pace this year, meaning it could be a challenge to keep the tight ends on the field. However, Baker mentioned the players have demonstrated their value so far.
“We gotta bring value to us being on the football field, we have to prove our worth,” Baker said. “And I would say over the first two weeks of camp, our guys have done that.” 
Baker also provided an update on senior tight end Josh Falo, who will look to make a bigger impact for the Trojans. Falo missed some time during the offseason, Baker said. 
“He’s slowly kind of been working his way back in, he’s had an integral part,” Baker said. “He had a great day of practice yesterday so it’s just slowly working his way back in and getting him back in playing shape.”
Krommenhoek and Baker both had high praise for redshirt freshman tight end Jude Wolfe. Wolfe has been eased into camp out of caution over a back injury.
“He’s incredibly talented. I think we’ve seen that the first two weeks of camp,” Krommenhoek said. “Just super explosive, loves to play, loves to run, loves to hit. I think he’s just matured so much in the last 12 months.”
The Trojans will look to use yet another part of their powerful offense beginning Nov. 7 against Arizona State.

If you had told me two weeks ago that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be one of the top streams on Twitch, I wouldn’t believe you. And yet here we are.
The representative had a peak of 435,000 viewers, making her one of the all-time most-watched streams on the platform. But should she and other politicians be allowed to stream? 
For those of you who don’t know, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a stream last Tuesday where she played Among Us with fellow Rep. Ilhan Omar and other major Twitch streamers. She quickly amassed a large audience, with 325,000 concurrent viewers. 
2020 really is insane.
That is not to say that I dislike Ocasio-Cortez or Omar. After all, I did watch the stream in its entirety. But something about politicians streaming video games just feels … wrong. 
The same can be said about political institutions as a whole. A while back, the U.S. Army announced its official esports team, and the internet was quick to ridicule them. Maybe the fact that the team tweets out cute anime girl GIFs and says “UwU” has something to do with it. 
In general, the criticism against the Army centered around how the military branch can trick young people into enlisting by going onto Twitch. Of course, it was never a secret that the esports team was made to recruit more people. But since a lot of children who haven’t developed the ability to read between the lines watch Twitch, many felt that this tactic was particularly nefarious — leading to politicians drafting an amendment to a bill that would stop the Army from using funds to maintain its Twitch operations. 
The proposition failed, but what matters is that a particular democratic representative created it. Of course, I am talking about Ocasio-Cortez.
To her credit, using your “opponent’s” tactics is very common in the field of politics. There are also various nuances to consider. She is only a representative, whereas the Army is an entire public institution that directly targets citizens to join its operation. But we can use this example to understand why politicians streaming can potentially be a bad thing.
If politicians continue streaming video games and acting like normal Twitch streamers, there is the risk of sending political messages to people who are still too young to understand the complexity behind them.
I can see the potential criticisms already: “If they’re so young, they shouldn’t be on Twitch in the first place,” “People are smarter than you think” and “You’re exaggerating!” Since these are very reasonable, let’s break them down.
First, the minimum age requirement to join Twitch is 13 years old. This means that you can access most of the platform’s content before reaching adulthood. In terms of whether or not they should, it is up to each individual to decide. The fact of the matter is that children have increasing access to the internet at younger ages, and since a lot of gaming content is centered on Twitch, it is only natural that they have sought it out.
Second, while I am certain that many of us are smart enough to discern when we are being fed a political message, we cannot let our confidence be our downfall. If anything, the issues with fake news show that we may not be as savvy as we think. So, if we as adults still struggle to discern the truth, what makes us think that children will fare better? 
Finally, I can see why people would say I am exaggerating. Like I said before, I watched the entirety of Ocasio-Cortez’s stream, and most of her political messages were a simple “go vote.” But this is bigger than Ocasio-Cortez or her stream. If we don’t think about these issues while they are still small, they will grow, and by the time we realize their damage it’ll be too late.
The platform has no internal checks. Nothing stops children from engaging in political streams, even if the politician or institution did not want them there. 
Let’s take Ocasio-Cortez’s stream as an example. With her insane numbers, a good portion of the viewers were likely children. Add that to the other streamers she was playing with, many of whom are popular in the gaming community, and kids are more likely to engage. So even if she did not share a particularly loaded political statement, simply being on Twitch and interacting with popular streamers serves to normalize her platform in the children’s minds, thus making them more inclined to listen to her when the time to be politically engaged comes. 
If more politicians and political institutions take this route, they might push their political agenda more blatantly and portray themselves as celebrities, taking populism to a whole different level. Worst of all, they’d be persuading one of the most vulnerable demographics to follow them, guaranteeing long-lasting support through underhanded means. 
I am aware that I sound like an old man. And to be honest, nothing would make me happier than being wrong. I hope that politicians use Twitch with reason, understanding how they might influence people who are too young to think for themselves. 
But taking into consideration the history of politicians’ co-opting new forms of media, from late President Franklin Delano Roosevelt with the radio and President Donald Trump with Twitter, I find that unlikely. After all, one of the jobs of a politician is to harness support, but it is up to us to recognize potential pitfalls and make necessary changes. 
Maybe this would involve minor solutions, such as teaching kids to consume media critically or increasing the age requirement on Twitch while asking for an official ID. Or maybe it would involve more drastic measures, such as banning any sort of political institution from the platform entirely. 
I am not sure which route to take, but I know that if we don’t make any decisions soon, we might end up with issues that we can no longer fix.

The L.A. Times Festival of Books is the largest literary gathering in the country, with over 150,000 Angelenos filling USC’s campus with pandemonium as students, families, press and residents gather each April to hear from a variety of authors and celebrate their love for books.
As with many other large gatherings, the festival was postponed because of the pandemic and later moved its operations online for the first time. Beginning this week, the Los Angeles Times commenced an online festival that will take place from Oct. 18 to Nov. 13.
“It was important for us to keep it going and to continue to support the authors and the booksellers and the exhibitors that we’ve worked with for all these years, to keep that event going in the way that we could, which was virtually,” said Ann Binney, special projects coordinator for the Times.
Binney has helped plan the event for the last 13 years and said the festival was easier and more affordable to coordinate through an online platform. Although the team of organizers continued to work with publicists, publishers and authors, she said organizers could include speakers whom they wouldn’t have been able to normally. She said that since the event is taking course over a period of four weeks, it offers a broad range of time to schedule speakers, compared to the typical two-day festival. 
Participants can browse the author lineup, which includes Jennifer De Leon, Natalie Portman, the Honorable Jerry Brown, Marlon James and USC professor Viet Thanh Nguyen. On the website, they can also note important dates through the Festival of Books website and register for virtual events on Eventbrite. 
Never having been to the festival before, Alyssa Delarosa, a junior majoring in psychology, said that she was always very interested in attending the event, but due to scheduling conflicts, she was unable to go in past years. She said the virtual format made the event convenient for her to participate this time.
“It means that they’re pushing for as much normalcy as possible,” Delarosa said. “And ‘the show must go on’ mentality. The event is so great that they’re gonna have it regardless of the format, so I like that.”
As with past events, moderators will lead authors or panelists in discussions on their writing process, and others will do readings of children’s books. They also explore current issues such as race and immigration and politics and coronavirus and provide tips on skills such as writing for audiobooks. In most cases, the moderator will ask questions that attendees submitted in advance.
Most years Binney said there can be up to 600 author events happening simultaneously within a two-day time frame, whereas this year’s festival will feature 25 events over the four-week period.
As all the events are online, Binney said event organizers collaborated with a video production team from the Times to make sure all of the speakers had good internet connection and lighting.
Although attendees can’t stand in line to buy books and have them signed, local booksellers partnered with the Times will place pre-signed bookplates into the books so attendees can still have that souvenir while supporting local sellers.
“Twenty-five years, we’ve had really strong relationships with the book selling community here in Los Angeles,” Binney said. “We’re doing what we can during this time, which is a difficult time for small businesses everywhere. It’s an especially hard time for booksellers. We’re doing everything that we can to support them with this event.”
According to Binney, the festival coordinators began promoting the events in September through digital and newspaper ads, social media posts and radio broadcasts. They also worked with the Times communications department, outside public relation firms and the author lineup to ensure a great outcome for the Festival of Books.
“We’re doing everything that we can to get that same excitement and engagement,” Binney said. “It’s hard, obviously, because we’re not in person. It’s just a different kind of engagement and it’s hard to replace the excitement of being in person and being around all that energy and excitement on campus. We’re doing everything that we can to translate that to the virtual format.”
Rachel Bernstein, a junior majoring in history, said that the L.A. Times Festival of Books cements the city’s presence in literature. As a native Angeleno, Bernstein attended the Festival of Books at least eight times, going back to the early years that the festival was hosted at UCLA.
“It’s just such a wonderful validating experience, especially for a reader,” Bernstein said. “I remember running around the UCLA courtyard [as a child], and I got to hear different children’s singers. And it’s really, really wonderful that you get to see, you get to meet celebrities. It’s just a really exciting thing you can do and it’s definitely a very special literary experience.”
Binney said that this year’s festival, the 25th year the event has been hosted, is a landmark moment that will still be celebrated through the online festivities. She said she believes this year’s festival will be frequently reflected on since all the events are recorded on YouTube for people to look back on. 
“I do think that we’ll always look back on this as being, you know, a significant time and way that we did this event,” Binney said. “I hope that we’re not in this forever, and that in 2021, we’ll be able to gather again in person and celebrate books with the community of people of Los Angeles at USC as we’ve done for all these years.”

Scores of Americans have created resource guides and infographics in an effort to educate and promote civic engagement in the run-up to the 2020 election. However, for a significant number of Americans, including many Vietnamese Americans, language barriers make these resources inaccessible. Alumna Cookie Duong and Jady Chan, a senior majoring in computational neuroscience, are trying to change that.
In June, Duong and Chan created The Interpreter, a news aggregator website that translates news articles, op-eds and analyses from major international outlets into Vietnamese. Since its creation only five months ago, the website has since expanded significantly. It is updated regularly, with approximately three to six articles translated every day and is staffed by dozens of volunteer translators and editors. 
The website was created to bridge the information gap caused by language barriers by providing young people with Vietnamese-language materials to help them start difficult conversations regarding social justice, police brutality, solidarity and the history of racism in the United States.
Following the killing of George Floyd in May, Duong recalls attempting to have a conversation with her father about the Black Lives Matter movement. As a general voting bloc, Vietnamese Americans are the most conservative group within the broader Asian American community, and sharp divisions exist between the community’s older generation — often conservative  — and the younger generation — often progressive. 
Unfortunately, the conversation didn’t go as Duong had hoped it would. Her father’s general contempt for the movement remained firm, but Duong saw an opportunity to create change regardless. 
“I fell short,” Duong said. “So I thought if I can’t convince my dad, then maybe I can convince someone else. So the original goal was just to share a few articles — translated and edited by me on a website and created by me — to my friends.”
After receiving an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from her friends and hearing how needed a service like The Interpreter was, Duong created a GoFundMe page for the website and donations poured in. Amid the groundswell of support, Duong knew that the significance of The Interpreter necessitated expansion beyond what she had originally intended. 
“A lot of people wanted to connect with us … and I realized, this can’t be stopped in my circle, and it’s something that should be shared with the rest of the community,” Duong said. “So there was really no other option besides expanding and getting more hands on deck.” 
Along with Chan, who helped set up and refine the website after discovering The Interpreter on Instagram in June, Duong continued developing the resource’s online presence. What was once a collection of a few translated articles has become a substantial organization. The Interpreter now has an onboarding and application process for prospective translators and boasts a staff of more than 40 volunteers that span various cities, high schools and universities across the United States and Vietnam. 
One of these volunteers, Calum Nguyen, a junior at USC majoring in philosophy, politics and law and French, joined The Interpreter’s staff after discovering the website in September. Nguyen said he thinks The Interpreter has the potential to promote important political and social conversations within the Vietnamese community. 
“I hope it gives a source of knowledge for the people who care deep down about these issues [but don’t have] access [to translated] fact-checked articles,” Nguyen said. “They’ll be able to use The Interpreter as a resource to have more knowledge and a better understanding of the world around them, the political works around them, to have these conversations because we definitely need these conversations in the Vietnamese community.”
Nguyen also emphasized his hopes for greater change within the Vietnamese American community. 
“As of right now, the Vietnamese American community has the biggest disparity between the older generations and the younger generation in terms of political identity, and it doesn’t have to be this way,” Nguyen said. 
Working to create change within the community is difficult, Duong admits, but some of the surprises she has come across along the way have left her far more encouraged than disillusioned.  
“Being in this field has surprised me a lot because I didn’t realize how much we were up against and how difficult it would be to institute this sort of structural change in people’s way of thinking,” Duong said. “But I’ve also realized that we are kind of at this cusp of change as well. I’m not alone at all. There’s all these young people who are finding their ways back to their community, doing good and working at a grassroots level to help elevate their community and I’m so proud and so grateful to be a part of it.”
Jane Junn, a professor of political science and gender and sexuality studies who authored a book on Asian American political participation, underscored the potential reach and impact that the website could have for the Vietnamese American community. 
“What used to be the highly labor-intensive, interpersonal exercise of translation is now scaled up to the capacity that really anybody can read it,” Junn said. “That’s potentially enormously influential … I think any time people make politics and what’s going on in politics and society and culture more accessible to newcomers allows for us to understand each other, it allows for newcomers to better understand the world they live in. So I think it could be enormously influential.”
When it comes to the future of The Interpreter, Duong and Chan said they hope to continue to expand the website and have considered turning the organization into a nonprofit to potentially pay their staff and form a full-fledged newsroom. Duong also wishes, however, that her team’s impact might eventually be mirrored by the contributions of future organizations that bridge the gap between politics and other American immigrant communities. 
“So far we have gotten multiple messages from young people who have thanked us for providing the linguistic resources that helped them to make a case [to] their parents — whether it be [highlighting that] there are real injustice in the world or that they should not vote for Donald Trump — whatever it might be, we are making some impact in the community,” Duong said. “Obviously, it’s not one single battle, it’s a long fought war, so I’m hoping that this newsroom will be the first among many that are active in the hopes of pushing the community forward and bringing credible and fact-checked information to our parents and those who need it.”

This one is gonna hurt, but you need to be more critical of the media you consume, especially when there is and has been a dire need for more realistic narratives that represent the breadth of what it means to be LGBTQ+. I finally decided to confront this in the column because, as per usual, a tweet I didn’t want to see (or understand?) came up on my timeline. 
English director Francis Lee’s romantic drama “Ammonite” premiered at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 11. It was met with generally good reviews and earned high praise for Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan’s performances as women who “have no one to turn to but each other.”
The narrative loosely lassos around the life of English paleontologist Mary Anning, a scientist who was shunned from the 19th century academic community which was almost completely composed of men. Her contributions to the field have laid the groundwork for our present-day conception of prehistoric life on Earth, as she studied fossils along the English Dorset coast. This location, secluded and dominated by nature, is also where Lee decided to set the stage for romance. 
The tweet in question? In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Winslet revealed that she shuffled the “Ammonite” shooting schedule so that the filming of the sex scene could fall on the same day as Ronan’s birthday. 
“I just wanted her to have a great memory in her film life, regardless of how the scene played out or the movie turned out,” Winslet said.
If you’re looking for analysis on this quote, I don’t have it, just wanted to share. 
But doesn’t this plot sound … familiar?
I remember going to the Aero Theatre last December, just before the new year, and finding a nice little spot to the far right side and two rows away from the screen to watch “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” It also happened to be the first movie that I decided to see by myself, which was good because I left the theater making gross, sniffling noises, trying to keep my tears from reddening my face further as I ran back to my car and pretended I was in the music video for Radiohead’s “No Surprises” while I made the trip back from Brentwood. 
Looking back on the big huge cliche I was, I find it surprising that for someone who saw “Portrait” about seven times in theaters last winter, I have felt uneasy about watching it since. But why? It’s not a “Blue is the Warmest Color” or a “Disobedience” where the enormous amount of sex was obviously a man’s decision, but it is another white sapphic period drama to add to the growing pile.
I have no qualms or critiques for “Portrait” or Céline Sciamma. The movie is absolutely gorgeous, and I will always cherish that embarrassing first viewing as one of the greatest moments I’ve ever had with film. But its impact on the critical and audience world is pushing the representation of LGBTQ+ individuals in a “two steps forward, one step back” pattern. 
For both “Ammonite” and “Portrait,” isolation is a key factor that drives the romantic plot. For the former, it was the earthy, rocky coast of Lyme Regis West Dorset, England, and the latter’s gorgeous seaside scenes were filmed in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon in Brittany, France. It frames the love stories as natural against the obvious backlash they would receive if sequestered within the more populated towns and cities of the 17th and 18th centuries. It also removes as many outside, patriarchal influences as possible — so much so that when a man showed up in “Portrait” I jumped out of my seat.
This sort of analysis is what I heard and read a lot of when “Portrait” made it through the international film festival circuit, and “Ammonite” is mirroring this trek. People are applauding that big names are taking on lesbian stories, but they seem unwilling to go into any further and productive commentary.
This is gonna hurt.
These films hold major issues of accessibility. They are filmed in beautiful, breathtaking remote European locations.. They are beloved period dramas — and don’t touch on any contemporary LGBTQ+ issues. One fourth of the main actresses are actually lesbian. All of the actresses are white. 
I admit that the “white sapphic period drama” is a pretty specific genre that both films have no choice but to check the boxes for, but their success, and the lack of critique from the voices that control media discourse at the moment, are pigeonholing lesbian narratives further and further into this box. There are plenty of great critiques that aren’t amplified on this issue of representation. Many are of the casual kind on Twitter, such as my favorite by user @monroville who quote-tweeted a trailer for “Ammonite” with the biting but needed reaction of “good god another boring sapphic movie, bonus points for it being a period piece with a 500000 year age gap.”
If you really love the films for what they are, you need to be willing and actively acknowledge their role in perpetuating a very narrow representation of sapphic romance. It helps no one but the people selling lesbian stories because they are “easier to swallow” — coded language for acceptable to a point because even though they are lesbian, it is OK because they are white and of European descent.
I love “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” with my entire being, but its existence is a further indicator of backward progress in diverse representation in film. These narratives, including those in “Pariah” and “Watermelon Woman,” need to be accessible as much as they are inclusive, so that folks who look different than me and are of different backgrounds can come back from a theater and see their own experiences validated. Right now, these films, and the industry at large, tell them “It’s not your time yet” or “It will never be your time.”

I once had a teacher that said something along the lines of, “There is no excuse not to vote in this country.” He definitely knew that limitations to voting exist for non-citizens, felons and mentally incapacitated (the latter two dependent on one’s state), but what he meant was that anybody eligible to vote can. If not overly circular, that is a true statement; anybody who can vote can vote. 
That being said the statement is uncharitable and ignorant of the reality of voter suppression in this country. American voter suppression is the same age as this country. There have been voter suppression highs (the Jim Crow South) and lows (the years following implementation of the Voting Rights Act), but it’s always been present. Since the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidating sections four and five of the Voting Rights Act, which required state and local governments with a history of voter discrimination to preclear any changes to their voting laws or practices, voter suppression has been steadily approaching a new peak.
The face of voter suppression has changed throughout the years. The poll taxes, literacy tests and record-keeping requirements of the Jim Crow South have been replaced with voter-roll purges, cuts to early voting, poll closures and voter ID laws. The rise in voter suppression is found particularly in the South and Republican-led swing states and its consequences, while hard to exactly quantify, have been palpable. 
Perhaps the man who most personified this shift of voter suppression tactics is Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Kemp is a descendant of a once politically and economically prominent (and slave-owning) Georgia family that all but lost relevance in the years following the abolition of slavery. The would-be scion entered state politics in 2003 and was later appointed Georgia Secretary of State, before winning the statewide office as an incumbent. 
In the eight years he served before his infamous election to the Governor’s office, he was responsible for purging nearly 1.5 million Georgians from the voter rolls, half of which were purged in the two years immediately preceding his gubernatorial election. Over the same time period, more than 200 polling places were shuttered, doubling Georgian’s average distance to the polls, especially hard hit were Black and low-income communities — populations that would have been more inclined to vote for Kemp’s competitor, Stacy Abrams. And as if those two barriers were not enough, Kemp also implemented burdensome voter ID laws, proof of citizenship requirements, and cuts to early voting. 
A report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and verified by multiple non-partisan statistics experts, concluded that without Kemp’s closure and relocation of voting places, an estimated 54,000-85,000 more Georgians would have participated in the election. Kemp won by 54,723 votes. 
These problems are not unique to Georgia or Kemp — since Shelby County v. Holder, thousands of polling stations have closed across the South. In fact, Georgia is only third on the list of the worst-offending states. 
In Texas, which is already ranked the hardest state to vote in by researchers at Northern Illinois University, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott recently limited counties to one absentee ballot dropoff locations, irrespective of size or population, a move that will hurt the most-populous counties that tend to vote Democratic. With the same intention, he exempted polling places from his statewide mask order — a truly indefensible order designed to intimidate the most vulnerable Texans. 
Voter suppression, in its current iteration, is the manifestation of the last gasps of a dying Republican Party that has nothing to stand for. A Republican Party that, even excluding its current leader, is increasingly populated by figures that are more than willing to buck democracy in order to obtain and maintain power. 
In the run up to the 2016 election, mainstream Republican commentator Ann Coulter used a tweet to muse about a hypothetical grandfather clause, writing that “If only people with at least 4 grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a 50-state landslide.” Earlier this month, perpetually unprovoked Utah Sen. Mike Lee hopped on Twitter to declare that “We’re not a democracy,” a claim he qualified exactly five hours later with the not-quite-less-bizarre tweet “Democracy isn’t the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity [prosperity] are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.” 
To Republican leadership, the purpose of our democracy is to ensure the continued existence of the Republican Party and that continued existence is more important than democracy itself. It is with this ethos that they are emboldened to brazenly suppress voters and push an explicitly anti-democratic (note the lowercase D) agenda when it comes to statehood for Washington D.C., redistricting and, above all, voting.
The Republican Party is coordinated, from county clerk to president to the Supreme Court, in their quest to suppress the vote. The evidence is clear as day and this knowledge is critical in the fight against voter suppression. As Vann R. Newkirk II wrote in The Atlantic, “The true nature of voter suppression as an accumulation of everyday annoyances, legal barriers, and confusion has come into full view. Today, voter suppression is a labyrinth, not a wall.”
Understanding this doesn’t change the fact that virtually anyone eligible to vote can, with enormous effort, vote, but it acknowledges the real challenges faced by millions of Americans around the country as they attempt to surmount voter suppression from the hands of their so-called leaders to accomplish our most basic civic duty. This election, I’m voting for capital D Democrats for lowercase D democracy.

As we near the end of the fall semester, now more than ever, it’s important we focus on ways to practice self-care. Although self-care is important regardless of the global climate, it is especially relevant amid the pandemic and health concerns; let’s remember how crucial our mental health is as well. Considering the new challenges students face with virtual learning, making time to focus on themselves and engage in self care to protect well being and happiness is valuable. 
We’ve compiled a list of some of our staff writers’ favorite arts and entertainment-related self-care activities, so get ready to take some notes and learn about ways to concentrate on yourself for this coming break. 
Although I’m not the best at drawing, I love getting to draw my favorite TV characters in college gear. I’m a huge cartoon fan, so I’ve done “The Powerpuff Girls” and characters from “Rick and Morty” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” It’s something that makes me happy and sometimes I’ll send the drawings to my friends who go to different colleges around the country. I’ll usually change the character’s appearance slightly, so they look more like the friend I am sending it to. 
Drawing characters allows me to stop worrying about life and just concentrate on the linework, which helps me center myself. I feel great at the end of it because I’ve taken some time to do something I like, and I also get to brighten up some of my friends’ days! I like that it’s easy to fit into my schedule, no matter how busy it is since I can pick up where I left off without any problem. I can do as much or as little as I would like at a time. It also gives me an excuse to try out different art supplies that I otherwise wouldn’t be using. I’d recommend it to anyone who doesn’t think they are good at drawing because I find it is easier to work with cartoon characters than real people.

In the midst of daily Zoom classes, my main focus has become prioritizing time spent outdoors to give my eyes and mind a much-needed break. A recent self-care activity that I like to do in between classes is going on a walk while listening to music or a podcast. One podcast that I have recently been diving into is Dax Shepard’s, “Armchair Expert,” where he interviews celebrities each week about the ups and downs of life. Setting aside just 30 minutes to walk outside and listen to a podcast helps me not only clear my head but also provides me with the opportunity to step away from my laptop. In addition to podcasts, I’ll usually listen to “feel-good” songs that help me escape the reality of quarantine, like Elton John’s, “I’m Still Standing,” and Billy Joel’s, “Only the Good Die Young.” Although technology has been extremely helpful in staying connected, hours spent staring at a computer screen can easily take its toll. 
Taking the time to close my laptop screen and take a break from social media and exercise has helped me stay active and present when the days become monotonous. Although I enjoy working out, it can easily get repetitive and boring if I don’t make it exciting by listening to a podcast or music. Looking forward to the new episode of “Armchair Expert,” or listening to songs I’ve recently added to my playlist are additions that help encourage me to get outside and makes an activity as simple as walking, more entertaining. Despite the fact that staying inside often seems like the easy choice, I always feel better after I force myself to move, get some fresh air and take my mind off of online work for a moment. Gaining that clarity becomes an essential part in maintaining my stress levels and focus for the rest of the day.

My favorite form of self-care is listening to music. Sometimes having the right song to listen to can completely change my mood or mindset, so I try to give myself breaks in between homework for opportunities to listen to music and destress. Currently, I’ve been listening to Fleetwood Mac’s self titled album along with “Rumours” during my breaks, and these albums create very relaxing environments for me. Specifically, the song “Rhiannon” is one of my favorites and brings me peace while I’m trying to grind out lab reports.
Besides Fleetwood Mac, artists I generally listen to for destressing include Wallows, The 1975, ASAP Rocky, Aaron May, Rex Orange County and Mac Miller for their various abilities to either energize or relax me. When I listen to music that I enjoy I’m able to shift my focus away from the stress of school and let myself be enveloped in the emotions of the songs. By taking the time out of my schedule to enjoy music, I’m allowing myself space to exist and think outside of school, and direct my attention to how I feel outside of my productivity.

When I feel like chucking my laptop against a wall after a long day of Zoom classes, I pick up a book and sit outside to read. Whether it’s for 30 minutes or two hours, taking the time to get some fresh air and to look at something other than a computer screen really helps me decompress. Right now, I’m in the middle of reading Dan Brown’s “The Lost Symbol” and Richard Powers’ “The Overstory.” I’d highly recommend both of these books to anyone looking for a heart racing treasure hunt through Washington D.C. or for those looking to slow down and contemplate human beings’ relationship with trees. 
In our world of streaming services and social media, we’re all easily tempted to binge watch a TV show or mindlessly scroll through hundreds of TikToks in one sitting as a “break” from Zoom classes. If anything, this just adds to our daily tech fatigue. In order to prioritize my physical and mental health during this strange semester, I take the time to unplug — from texts, Instagram, Snapchat, Slack, email, everything — and reconnect with myself by jumping into a different world through the pages of a book.

Zoom fatigue has really been hitting me hard these days, so when my classes are over you’ll generally find me curled up on my bed listening to Frank Ocean or BTS and reading a book. Since I’m not able to go to my local library anymore because of the pandemic, I’ve been using Goodreads a lot more to get book recommendations. Although I miss the librarians who would always point me toward the newest releases or a book they particularly liked, I’ve located several Goodreads reviewers who seem to have the same tastes in books as me. 
Since 2018, I’ve participated in the Goodreads yearly reading challenge, and this year I’ve challenged myself to read 75 new books. Two of my favorite books I’ve read so far are Ocean Vuong’s “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous” and Carol Rifka Brunt’s “Tell the Wolves I’m Home.” Both works are exquisitely written and deeply personal; I was turning the pages while holding back tears. Because I like to be a little dramatic while reading, I curate my playlist to the book I’m reading — for example, my reading session for “Tell the Wolves I’m Home” featured heart wrenching songs such as Frank Ocean’s “White Ferrari” and Current Joys’ “A Different Age.” I love to get lost in the pages of a book and it really helps me escape from my worries, even if it’s just for an hour.
