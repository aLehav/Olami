The Spatial Science Institute hosted the Fall 2016 Geodesign Speaker Series, where geodesign students shared their summer research and internship experiences in a panel open to students interest to the program, in the Allan Hancock Foundation building Wednesday.
Two students presented their summer experiences and were followed by questions from the panel about the impact of their research or internship. Panelist Diana Kim, a senior geodesign major, spoke about her experience working as a Geographic Information Science Intern in the Botanical Division at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. 
Kim said that her internship experience helped her realize what she wants to do upon graduating, which is work in the private sector, though before her internship, she was planning on going on to get her master’s degree and work in the public sector. 
“My past experience might have helped the other geodesign students learn about the opportunities that we can have here at USC,” Kim said, adding that she highly recommends the interdisciplinary geodesign major, which is between the School of Architecture, the Sol Price School of Policy, Planning and Development and the Dornsife College Spatial Science Institute.
“Within the geodesign major, you learn how to efficiently build a city through looking at and analyzing data,” Kim said. 
Ben Banet, a junior geodesign major, talked about his research experience with the study Beach Light — Measuring Ecological Light Pollution at the Land-Ocean Boundary, which is being conducted by Travis Longcore, an assistant professor of architecture and spatial sciences. Banet shared his experience collecting data on the Los Angeles county beaches over the summer. 
According to Darren M. Ruddell, director of undergraduate studies for the Spatial Science Institute, there are almost 50 students in the geodesign major, which was started three years ago. Ruddell said that the main purpose of the event was to have upperclassmen share the work they’ve been doing with the first- and second- year students of the program. 
“Really what we’re trying to do is educate and inform our first and second year students about all the different things that are possible and encourage them to pursue these opportunities, to create their own opportunities — you never know where these things lead,” Ruddell said.
Elizabeth Berson, a freshman majoring in geodesign who attended the event, said that due to the program’s small size, students are highly encouraged to utilize the programs offered to them. 
“It’s important for me to use the small community of the geodesign major to really understand the field and better myself, because I have the resources, and there’s only six geodesign majors in the freshman class,” Berson said. 
Berson added that the program’s size contributes to a close sense of community within the major. 
“It’s a great community, and everyone is really supportive and easy to talk to,” Berson said. “It’s also really lucrative — I didn’t even understand how important a lot of the stuff we study is to all these other fields, so I hope that more people become interested in geodesign.”
The next event in the GeoDesign Speaker Series will be held in October and will discuss assembling e-portfolios to help with gaining internships or research employment.

The USC School of Architecture hosted a Nabih Youssef Lecture on Structural Design Innovation at the FAIA Conference Center in Harris Hall on Wednesday evening.
Mutsuro Sasaki, a professor at Hosei University in Tokyo, gave the lecture, which focused on his breakthrough in structural optimizations and flux architecture.
Nabih Youssef, a renowned structural engineer specializing in earthquake engineering, is a lifetime member of the USC Architectural Guild. The Nabih Youssef Lecture series, which is funded by Youssef’s endowment, provides support for a lecture to be given by a distinguished structural engineer. 
Chikara Inamura, a research assistant at Mediated Matter Group, translated Sasaki’s lecture for the audience, which started off with a description of flux structures. These structures, Sasaki said, are freeform, complex, irregular, dynamic and organic.
“This new structure type has become an international trend in contemporary architecture scenes,” Sasaki said.
Sasaki also said that flux structures are changing the way architects and structural engineers collaborate in the professional and educational fields. 
“Historically, structural design classes were based on the humanistic knowledge of the engineers,” Sasaki said. “The more you build, the more you understand what works and what doesn’t.”
Sasaki’s repeated his design philosophy throughout the course of his lecture. He stressed freedom and the aesthetic necessary in flux structures. There are three important entities in the creation of a flux building according to Sasaki: structure, construction and architecture. 
“These three entities form a loop and together find a balance and derive my design process,” Sasaki said. “As a structural engineer, structure is an essential design.” 
Sasaki then went on to explain the fundamentals of formal freedom, which requires an architect to look at both the quality (form) of a structure and the quantity (scale). The form decreases as scale increases and vice versa. Sasaki’s first piece of advice to the architecture students in the room was to try to understand form and scale. 
For the next section of the lecture, Sasaki compared framed and spatial structures throughout history, including the Sydney Opera House, the Parthenon, the Bacardi Bottling Plant and the Teshima Art Museum, which he worked on. 
Sasaki also described his own successful career in architecture. He joined Nagoya University in 1964, which coincided with the Tokyo Olympics. Around 10 years after he graduated, Sasaki created his own firm, Sasaki Structural Consultants. He started his next firm, SAPS/Sasaki and Partners, in 2002.
Sasaki’s turning point came in 1995, 15 years after he started his first architecture firm, when he received a sketch that he thought was a joke. That project defined his continuing mantra of the organic relationship between structure and architecture. 
What started as a sketch culminated in the Sendai Mediatheque, a cultural media center which employed six steel-ribbed slabs supported by 13 earthquake-resistant, latticed steel pipes, while at the same time retaining a natural feel. 
“The sketch called for a return to nature and its organic structure. It also suggests and inseparable relationship between architecture and structure,” Sasaki said. “This philosophy is very much in line with the theme of flux structure, starting the beginning of a new chapter in my career as an engineer.”
The second part of Sasaki’s lecture focused on the structural optimization of free-curved RC shells. Swiss structural engineer Heinz Isler was the pioneer of free-curved concrete shells throughout the ’60s and was an inspiration for Sasaki’s own research in the optimization of these thin, concrete shells.
Sasaki created five of these free-curved structures in his own career, his most notable being the Teshima Art Museum. He explained during his lecture how he significantly optimized these concrete shells for structural integrity in the case of an earthquake through computational morphogenesis.
“The result doesn’t seem to show much change. However, optimization can significantly improve the structure’s performance by using the stresses and displacements in an earthquake,” Sasaki said. 
Graduate architecture student Peng Ie thought that Sasaki was able to give a general understanding behind his method without going into complex details.
“I’m glad he didn’t talk about too [many] technical things,” Ie said. “As an architecture student, we don’t know too much about engineering, and he shared his big idea, and that was really cool.” 
Sasaki closed with the important things that he learned throughout his own life that he hoped could help the younger generation he was speaking to. Now at 70 years old, he is retiring from teaching as a professor at Hosei University.
“For me, the ideas and inspirations all come by accident,” Sasaki said. “The important thing is how you take each accident and translate it into your own creativity.”

The USC School of Social Work has been named the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work following a $60 million donation by social work pioneer and two-time USC alum Suzanne Dworak-Peck, the University announced Wednesday.
“Suzanne Dworak-Peck is a visionary who has shown extraordinary leadership in her field, almost single-handedly changing how we perceive social workers,” said USC President C. L. Max Nikias in a press release. “In the trenches from the very start of her career, she has shown that her compassion and selflessness have no bounds. This gift ensures that the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work will continue to stand as an innovator by which all others are measured.”
According to the press release, the school has grown since its founding in 1920 to become the largest of its kind in the world, granting degrees to one out of every 20 Master’s level social workers in the United States. Vice Dean Carmen Frierson said that Dworak-Peck’s donation furthers the school’s large reach, which extends to an alumni network of 15,000. 
“I hope the community at large [benefits most from this endowment] in the sense that it furthers our hand,” Frierson said to the Daily Trojan. “The School of Social Work, individually, is not planning to make great change. We’re hoping to create people in the world to bring great change and to take some of the experiments and research that we’ve learned over the course of our history into the agencies that we touch.”
According to Frierson, the speeches delivered by both the Dworak-Peck and the Dean Marilyn L. Flynn on Wednesday during the announcement celebration concentrated on bringing innovation into the field.
“[We will be] putting social workers out there, creating social workers, going to places where social workers haven’t gone, [and collaborating] with other disciplines: engineering, data science, education, policy and planning,” Frierson said. “[We are] bringing together a team to do a great good.”
 Frierson added that the school will earn anywhere between 4 and 5 percent interest on the $60 million gift, which will go to fund future programs. One such beneficiary is the school’s military social work program, which helps veterans, servicemembers and their families transition from active duty into civilian life. The first of its kind at a civilian university, the program was established in 2008 and uses virtual patients to train graduate students in this specialized field.
According to the press release, Dworak-Peck served as president of both the National Association of Social Workers and the International Federation of Social Workers, founded NASW Communications Network and sat on the board of the California Social Welfare Archives. She received numerous awards for her accomplishments, including an Alumni Merit Award granted in 2016 for her dedication to USC and her accomplishments in social work. 
“Knowing that what we’ve done has been recognized by someone who has been within the circles is very exciting; no one really knew that she had the capacity to do that,” Frierson said. “It’s like you find a jewel that you didn’t know you had.”
Dworak-Peck received both a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s degree in social work from USC. Because of her personal connection to the University, many members of the School of Social Work faculty see the endowment as not just a financial gift, but also a symbolic gesture. 
“I think to have someone to have that faith in us — that’s incredible, especially someone who has been so dedicated to the profession herself,” said Rosemary Alamo, a clinical associate professor at the School of Social Work. “She could’ve donated to pretty much anywhere.”
Many students at the School of Social Work feel that the new name and funding gives the school more campus-wide recognition, especially compared to other programs.
“I have a surge of more USC pride, because now I feel like we’re more recognized and more official,” said Michelle Kim, a master’s in social work candidate at USC. “I’m excited for the future generation.”

The Trojans head up north to take on the No. 7 Stanford Cardinal in Palo Alto on Saturday in their first conference game of the season.  
To preview the matchup, the Daily Trojan asked a few questions to Vihan Lakshman, a football beat writer at the Stanford Daily. 
Daily Trojan: USC had no answer for Christian McCaffrey in the Pac-12 Championship Game last season. What are you predicting for McCaffrey on Saturday and how does USC slow him down?
Vihan Lakshman: Christian McCaffrey’s 461 all-purpose yard yards in the Pac-12 Championship Game was a performance for the ages, and I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect anyone to replicate that kind of performance, including Stanford’s version of Reggie Bush. Nevertheless, McCaffrey never runs out of gas and can do damage in so many different ways on the field that I expect him to put up great numbers. At this point in his career, I think it’s safe to pencil McCaffrey in for 200 all-purpose yards in any given matchup because of the sheer number of times he will have the ball in his hands. The return of dynamic running back Bryce Love and the attention he demands will also help McCaffrey.
For slowing down No. 5, I look at the blueprint laid out by three teams that had some degree of success against him last season: Northwestern, Washington State and Notre Dame. Each of those teams had defensive fronts that consistently broke into the backfield and swallowed McCaffrey before he ever got going. For all of his highlight-worthy plays, McCaffrey makes his money by patiently waiting for his blockers to open up holes before bursting for six or seven yards a carry. Defensive pressure up front neutralizes this ability. Moreover, pressure in the backfield can also rattle a quarterback, which can help slow McCaffrey down in the receiving game. Kevin Hogan was stellar in both of last year’s matchups with USC, contributing heavily to McCaffrey’s success, and the Trojans will have to bank on new quarterback Ryan Burns not quite maintaining Hogan’s same level of play in his second start. Slowing down McCaffrey is not an easy task, but if any team has the talent to make it happen, it’s USC.
DT: Do you see parallels between Stanford and USC’s quarterback situations? Ryan Burns and Max Browne are the respective starters, but their backups — Keller Chryst and Sam Darnold — are more mobile and have received playing time. How do you think Stanford will use its quarterbacks on Saturday?
V.L.: I think the parallels are there, but rather limited. Darnold, from what we have seen so far, looks much more mobile than Chryst, and the USC coaching staff seems to have several well-defined packages for their athletic redshirt freshman, particularly in the red zone. Darnold’s speed and ability to throw on the run allow him to complement Max Browne’s strengths and provide a change of pace for the Trojan offense. Burns and Chryst are very, very similar in skillset with just hairs of difference between them. David Shaw has said that Chryst will play against USC, and I expect that his role will be similar to the one he played against Kansas State where he came in on Stanford’s third offensive drive and led the Cardinal to a touchdown. Unlike Darnold, who’s more likely to take snaps in spot situations, Chryst will probably take over for an entire drive and run the offense as if no change had been made. Chryst’s role will largely depend on the flow of the game, but I see him as a lock to take over for one series, possibly two.
DT: What have you credited Stanford’s rise to national prominence over the past few years to?
V.L: The pillars of Stanford’s success in the past few years are the same as the ones at every elite program: talent and great coaching. What is remarkable is how the Cardinal built that platform in the first place. Stanford has mastered the art of selling the program to recruits, touting the school’s academics and rigorous admissions process as assets instead of hurdles. Shaw and company have also established a national recruiting presence with 29 states represented on the current roster (plus Canada and Austria), managing to find the driven, highly-talented players they covet who, most importantly, fit the program’s business-like culture.
Regarding coaching, Stanford has benefited tremendously from the presence of brilliant football minds and unprecedented stability. Without a leader as adept and, quite frankly, crazy as Jim Harbaugh, the Cardinal would have never gotten off the ground. Now, for all the criticism he’s received for his in-game coaching decisions over the years, David Shaw is an elite CEO managing the program with NFL coaching experience to draw on as well. Crucially, Shaw has also stayed on The Farm despite numerous opportunities to leave, bucking the trend of Stanford serving as a springboard for supposedly more prestigious coaching jobs. The stability at the top has trickled down. In the past three seasons, Stanford has lost just one assistant coach, Randy Hart, who retired after the 2015 Rose Bowl. That kind of continuity has been a major asset for the program, and it all starts at the top with Shaw and top-notch coordinators in Mike Bloomgren and Lance Anderson.
DT: How would you describe the relationship and perception of USC and the football team from the Stanford student body perspective?
V.L: People despise USC. The Trojans have a reputation on campus for braggadocious behavior and an obsession with Hollywood glitz that, whether rightly or wrongly, rub Stanford fans the wrong way. However, underneath the surface-level dislike, there’s a high level of respect for USC as a program that’s historically served as the standard-bearer for college football, especially on the West Coast. This combination of disdain and underlying respect, along with the riveting games between the two teams this decade, has stoked the flames of this rivalry to new heights. If you asked a Stanford student today whether a win against the Trojans would feel more satisfying than a victory over Cal, I have no doubt the answer would be “yes.”
DT: Do you see this game as a preview of a Pac-12 Championship re-match?
V.L.With so much football left to be played, it’s too hard to tell how the conference standings will ultimately shake out. I’m certainly not going into this game with the expectation that we’ll see Stanford and USC play again this season. There are just way too many other threats in the North and South that both teams will have to overcome. With that being said, both teams are extremely talented and could very well meet for another duel in Levi’s Stadium. As a fan of college football and rivalry games, I would very much enjoy such a rematch, but it’s way too early to tell if that’s in the cards.

The football team only got a brief break before getting shoved back in the national spotlight, as the Trojans continued prep for their upcoming clash at No. 7 Stanford during Wednesday’s practice at Howard Jones Field. Coming off a comfortable, 45-7 victory versus Utah State last weekend, USC will aim to prove that the season-opening debacle against Alabama was an anomaly with an upset over the Cardinal on Saturday night.
More McCaffrey
Head coach Clay Helton and his squad spent much of Tuesday’s practice discussing how to contain Stanford’s Heisman favorite Christian McCaffrey, and Wednesday was no different. The junior running back/receiver/kick returner is a jack-of-all-trades nightmare for any defense to cope with: a nightmare the Trojans suffered firsthand in the 2015 Pac-12 Championship game.
“Not only is this one of nation’s best running backs, but he’s also one of the best returners in the country,” Helton said.
Remembering McCaffrey’s game-breaking performance late last year, Helton said USC focused on third-down defense and kick and punt coverage during Wednesday’s practice. On Saturday, the players will look to execute defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s game plan.
“I’ve always thought Clancy does a great job of taking away your strength,” Helton said. “You saw that in the first two ballgames: taking away [Alabama receiver Calvin] Ridley and then last week taking away the running game … for Utah State.”
Two Can Play That Game
Helton called Stanford’s strategy with McCaffrey a game of “Where’s Waldo?” yesterday, as the Cardinal seem to somehow get their star involved in every facet of their offense. The Trojan head coach hopes to give this weekend’s opponent a taste of their own medicine by using a similarly explosive talent in USC’s receiving corps: JuJu Smith-Schuster.
“[Last week], you saw him as an outside receiver, you saw him as an inside receiver and you saw him in the backfield,” Helton said. “Kind of what Stanford does with McCaffrey, we try to do with JuJu so that he’s not targeted in one spot.”
Smith-Schuster has shouldered lofty expectations throughout his collegiate career, but he has faced some added scrutiny over the past couple of weeks. The wideout followed up a single-reception performance against Alabama with an in-practice scuffle leading up to the game against Utah State, and a few days ago, Bleacher Report said NFL scouts voted Smith-Schuster the most overrated player in college football.
Junior wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson covers Smith-Schuster during practice and occasionally lines up alongside him on offense, and the junior cornerback laughed off the report questioning his teammate’s talent.
“I don’t think so,” he said. “I don’t think he’s the most overrated college football player.
Jackson added that Smith-Schuster should use the comments as motivation. 
“I go against him every day,” he said. “I know what type of guy he is, and everyone else knows. Whoever said that—JuJu just has to take it and go prove them wrong.”
A Familiar Foe
After taking on opponents from the SEC and Mountain West to start the season, USC is excited to begin in-conference matchups. Having played Stanford twice last year, the Trojans feel like they know what to anticipate in Palo Alto this Saturday, although it remains to be seen if they will be able to stop the Cardinal.
“They’ve been doing it ever since coach [Jim] Harbaugh was there,” Helton said. “Their kill system, being able to call two plays in the huddle and get to the best play based on look. Hogan did a great job last year with it, as do all of their quarterbacks. I remember [Andrew] Luck doing the same thing.”
Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne agreed with his coach and said he couldn’t wait to face the Cardinal’s similarly predictable (and effective) defense.
“You know what you’re going to get with Stanford: very solid up front and schematically very sound,” he said. “We’re excited for the challenge and ready to get after them.”
Injury Update
Helton announced sophomore safety Marvell Tell was cleared to play on Saturday, and senior right tackle Zach Banner was back in practice after sitting out a day with a stomach bug. According to Helton, sophomore defensive tackle Noah Jefferson will “probably be out” against Stanford.

After a rocky start to the season, No. 21 women’s volleyball looks to Thursday and Friday’s games at the Pac-12 Challenge. 
The Women of Troy have won their past six matches, and will face Oklahoma (9-1) and Maryland (7-2) at the Pac-12 Challenge at the Galen Center. Oklahoma, on Thursday, appears to be the most difficult.
 The Sooners have only lost one game this season, and the Trojans will have to rely on film since they have  never seen Oklahoma play live this season. 
They will, however, have the chance to see Maryland play before they face them on Friday. Head coach Mick Haley said that Maryland is a more physical team that faced many injuries last year, so they may not necessarily know what to expect from them. 
Haley explained how the goals for the team will remain constant throughout the season — to see less errors and to compete at a higher athletic level. 
He noted that the team is bonding closer together. 
“We’re starting to get to know each other a little better,” Haley said. “We’re getting more organized, which means we can play using our system.”
The Trojans have many newcomers, such as freshman Khalia Lanier, who has stepped up in her role as outside hitter. Haley said the team’s 0-3 start was not ideal, but the Trojans are dealing with it well. They are becoming tighter as a group, which helps the team learn to trust one another and work together more cohesively. 
Senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins echoed Haley’s statement. She explained how the beginning of season was a little rougher than they wanted, but they were still trying to work out the kinks in their team. 
“Practice went well after that first tournament,” Ruddins said. “Everyone is connecting better and beginning to buy into our team’s standards.”
Both Haley and Ruddins said that the attitude at practice has been a tenacious one. Both returning and new players are holding each other accountable to the team’s standards and game plan. However, the Trojans could still use some work in regard to the communication between their setters and hitters. 
“It is important for the hitters to get into groove with the setter on court to finish stronger,” Ruddins said. 
Overall, Haley believes many members of the team are coming together. The first he mentioned were his middle blockers. In addition to Ruddins, junior Jordan Dunn has become much more competitive, while sophomore Madison Murtagh can play both middle and right side. The setters are becoming more comfortable with the offense, while senior libero Taylor Whittingham is reliable on defense. 
“With a combination of the setters getting better, the hitters scoring, and the middles starting to pound, we will see success,” Haley said. 
USC’s first match against Oklahoma on Thursday will begin at 8 p.m.

The women’s cross country team may be a small group, but it is close knit and off to a good start. 
The team is composed of 11 runners, most of whom are freshmen and sophomores, though the team does include several juniors, seniors and even graduate students. 
 For head coach David Freeman, though this is one of the youngest teams he has ever coached, it doesn’t lack for skill. 
“[This is] potentially the most talented [team]  top to bottom,” he said.
Redshirt junior Rebekah Ent noted the camaraderie among the teammates is strong. 
“[The team is] a lot closer than it has been in the past, with a solid group of girls who are all working towards the same goals,” she said. 
The team has already run their first meet, the Pepperdine XC Invitational, and came away undefeated. The Trojans beat Cal State Bakersfield, Long Beach State, Pepperdine and UC Irvine for their first overall win since 2014. 
Redshirt sophomore Madison Ricks led the team with a 15:14.37 first place finish and an eight-second lead over the second place finisher. In addition to Ricks, the team saw five runners finish in the top 13, including sophomore Amber Gore, who finished fourth with a time of 15:26.05. Gore is coming back from an injury last season and is considered to be one of the runners to look out for, according to Ent. 
“It was a really good first race, especially coming off an injury last year and a good starting point for where I want to be this year,” Gore said.
Even with the win, Freeman is staying focused on the next meet.
“This is just a starting point,” he said. “We are just trying to get the rust out of the way and get back to training tomorrow and used the next two and a half weeks to get ready to compete at Riverside in our next meet.” 
Freeman is focusing on catching up the younger runners and getting them into the Pac-12 mindset with the help of older runners such as redshirt seniors Vivian Grimes and Lorea Ibarzabal. 
“They both have seen it all and have experienced the ups and downs of college, so I think they can add a lot through their experience,” Freeman said.
The veterans have already inspired the younger runners to win the Pac-12, and the team is off to a great start to making that dream come true. 
Their next meet is the UC Riverside Invite this Saturday. 
“I’m looking forward to seeing how I can do with larger competition, and I think that the team is stronger than it ever has been,” Gore said.

The Trojans will take on one last opponent this weekend before entering a stacked season of conference play. This Friday’s matchup against the University of Kansas will serve as a final chance for head coach Keidane McAlpine to fine tune his team.
The Trojans are looking to continue a five-game shutout streak in their sole match this Friday at home. Coming off of an ESPNW Player of the Week recognition from her performances against Georgia and Auburn, senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme has led her team to those five straight blank sheets. 
The latest shutout over No. 8 North Carolina added fuel to a team already hungry to prove themselves in the regular season. The Trojans dominated the top-ranked and well-established Tar Heels squad from start to finish, pulling out a 3-0 upset with goals from senior Morgan Andrews, senior Katie Johnson and junior Nicole Molen.
“I think we’re coming together in a way that is really exciting for all of us,” senior defender Kayla Mills said. “I think all of us believe in ourselves, and we believe that if we keep playing together the way we have, there’s really no limit to what we can do.”
Friday’s game will be less of a challenge than North Carolina posed for the Trojans, as they play an unranked University of Kansas squad that has struggled on the road this season with a 5-2-1 overall record. Andrews acknowledged that the Jayhawks are a solid team from year to year, often providing challenges for top-ranked squads. But she said that this final game will mostly be a time for the team to address problems they’ve seen throughout the season in preparation for upcoming conference games against teams such as Stanford.
From the sidelines, McAlpine has noted that many of his pairs — particularly Andrews and Mills — have been continuing to improve their chemistry, becoming more comfortable in the attacking third of the field. And with a defense that is consistently shutting down teams, the Trojans are beginning to feel that they’re getting into their groove.
“As a senior, I’m looking to leave it all out on the field when I’m out there,” Andrews said. “But I think that’s a mentality that a lot of the team has. Everyone wants the girl playing next to her to do her best. It’s a really team mentality. We just want to succeed together as a team and prove to the rest of the country what we can bring.”

I love the Weekender. We all love the Weekender. Nothing there is groundbreaking. The Weekender is a fun tradition, and the rivalry with Stanford over the past few years has made it all the more exciting.
As a freshman, less than a month into my college experience, I made my first Weekender trip. It was, and still is, the most exciting sporting event I have attended as a fan. After being on the fence for a few days, a friend and I bought cheap front row tickets just a couple of days before the game.
As we arrived at Stanford and began to walk around in what can only be described as a dirt parking lot with a forest growing in the middle, it became evident that USC fans travel well — especially to this game. 
At the time the Cardinal were No. 13 and we were No. 14, though I’m sure all the delusional USC fans (I will include myself in this group this time) thought that the Trojans were guaranteed to come away with a win.
Then there was an Andre Heidari field goal, a J.R. Tavai fumble and the rest is history. The team went nuts, the fans went nuts, the band went nuts and my love for the Weekender was born. I have to think I at least partly reflect on this game with such happy thoughts because of the outcome and how exciting the game was despite being just a 13-10 final score.
At the same time though, I only remember two football plays from the whole game — the aforementioned — but I have equally clear memories of all of the Trojan fans who were there as well.
On the drive up, I remember thinking that every car we passed must have been a USC fan since there was so much Cardinal and Gold on what is normally a quite dreary trek up the 5.
There was the tailgate, where even though we were technically in enemy territory, many families brought us into their tailgates, fed us and let us hang out.
Then in the stadium, what should have clearly been a Stanford crowd was overshadowed by the USC faithful who in addition to traveling in force, also cheered in force. Since school hasn’t even started yet for Stanford, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the crowd be a majority of Trojan fans again. This would also explain why the Stanford band will probably be booed when they take the field, as they were in 2014.
Of course at that time, USC was nationally relevant and Stanford didn’t have a player who was a Heisman snub. The USC-Stanford rivalry, though, has been full of surprise results and unexpected endings. 
Even though the focus, and rightfully so, has consistently been on how terribly USC was shown up by Stanford not once but twice last year, there is an undeniable magic about the Weekender, for both teams, that renders neither home field safe from the visitor.
USC beating Stanford on Saturday is a long shot. Clearly Stanford has the more talented, stable and disciplined team, but anything can happen on the Weekender. Last time the Trojans and Cardinal met in Palo Alto, USC snapped the Cardinal’s 17-game home winning streak which was, at the time, the longest in the country.
Now, if USC defeats Stanford, it will probably have played a role in Christian McCaffrey not winning the Heisman for the second year in a row, and it will immediately put talks of a playoff berth in the minds of Trojans everywhere.
Here’s to hoping that this year, even with the odds against the Trojans, the flocks of USC fans will show up, fighting on and that win or lose, the trip will give us a memory worthy of starting a story, “Remember that one time we all went to the Weekender?”

Photo courtesy of Bryan ChungHave a little faith · Bryan and Brian Chung created Alabaster Co., a company that wants to make the Bible beautiful. It aims to combine religion and design together with the goal of “revealing the beauty of God.”
An artistic and spiritual venture developed by two USC alumni, Alabaster Company is a bible company created to giv the Bible a new design. It was named “Project We Love” by Kickstarter. Since its launch on Sept. 7, the Kickstarter campaign has already raised more than $31,000 of its $35,000 goal and gained widespread recognition. 
Alabaster’s creators, Brian and Bryan Chung, hope to create a visual experience that will foster deeper understanding of the world and God by integrating original digital artwork into the gospels of the Bible. Alabaster, described as “The Bible Beautiful,” is designed to provide readers — both Christian and non-Christian — with a unique experience of engaging with the Bible to ultimately reveal the beauty of God through visual aesthetics. Brian graduated from USC in 2010 as a business administration major with a minor in communication design, and Bryan graduated in 2015 as an animation and digital arts major. The former is currently on staff with InterVarsity Trojan Christian Fellowship, one of USC’s largest Christian fellowships, the latter with the InterVarsity chapter at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena. The Daily Trojan sat down with the duo to discuss their endeavor and thoughts on the relationship between visual design and culture.
Daily Trojan: What sparked the idea for Alabaster?
Bryan: During my time in college, I was focusing a lot on technical art, which had nothing to do with the story or the philosophy about art. The requirements were just to make the thing look right. In the back of my head, I always wanted to ask some sort of larger question about beauty and art, and I specifically wanted to ask these in the contexts of God and Christianity. That’s how Alabaster first came about for me.
Brian: Bryan and I were having a late night conversation about art and faith together. It felt like we were in line with the overarching vision, which was to have a conversation about art and beauty. As we talked about it with our friends, there was a sense of, “Oh, people would like something like this!”
DT: What is the meaning behind the name “Alabaster?”
Bryan: There is a passage in Mark 14 about a woman with an alabaster jar. This is one of the only times in the gospel that Jesus calls something “beautiful.” Jesus is about to die, and she comes and puts very expensive perfume from the alabaster jar by breaking the jar over his head, and she sort of anoints him before his burial. In that culture, you wouldn’t have done that because the alabaster jar was worth a year’s wages. But, Jesus says that she has done a beautiful thing. She was very sacrificial, generous and gratuitous. We wanted to adopt the spirit of the woman as we were creating and designing Alabaster.
DT: Why do you think this new take on the Bible take will be impactful in comparison to traditional formats of the Bible, specifically for non-Christians?
Brian: We think that our culture today is asking the question of “what is beautiful.” From Instagram to websites to the aesthetics of a restaurant, there is something about beauty that attracts us. Obviously, we hope that Christians will feel that this is a new way for them to experience God. We also hope that Alabaster will be good for people who are spiritually curious. The Bible might seem super intimidating because it’s just a bunch of words that are close together and badly printed, and so they might not normally open that up because it just feels ugly or irrelevant. We hope that this is a safer place for people to check out spirituality, in a beautiful way.
Bryan: The thinking behind that is beauty is very human and very honest. Regardless of if you believe in Christianity or not, there is still something very human about making art and seeing that through Jesus’s story.
DT: How has attending and working at USC shaped your current views on the relationship of God and visual beauty?
Brian: What I love about USC is that there is a high value for integrating various fields. Being at USC has helped us think about our faith-life and our career together rather than separate. USC encourages its students to explore two things in relation to one another. In this light, Alabaster combines the text of the Bible with visual beauty.
DT: What do you envision for the future of Alabaster, or do you have any other projects in store?
Bryan: We obviously want to do more books of the Bible. I think the underlying vision of Alabaster is to create a dialogue between beauty and God. Our hope for Alabaster as a whole doesn’t have to be limited to making Bibles. If we want to create a conversation between beauty and faith, there are other ways to do that. I think it’d be cool to explore different aesthetics and what they say about who God is.

On my first day at the Vans Warped Tour, I woke up in a frenzy as my alarm went off at 7 a.m. I immediately sat up, managed to hit my head on the ceiling and then retreated to a pitiful hunched upright position. Whipping open the curtain covering my bunk, I made my way to the floor, carefully stepping on the edge of the bunk below me before jumping to the ground.
I lifted up my mattress and withdrew my “I just want to drink soy lattes, save animals, and take naps” peta2 shirt and a pair of shorts, before heading to the back room to get ready for the day.
Are you familiar with the insurmountable fear that arises when you unexpectedly get pushed into a cold body of water? Or perhaps scarier, the fear that arises when you force yourself into the icy water? Well, my voluntary leap of faith that first morning of the Vans Warped Tour was oddly warm — perhaps because we were in Dallas in mid-June.
At 8 a.m. sharp, I got off the bus for our group meeting. Caroline Dymphna, the peta2 administrator for our Skins tour, gave the nine activists a rundown for the day before quickly sending us off to hit lines — the two main lines that is.
Arriving at one of the main entrances, malaise crept up my spine as I looked at the hundreds of people I was about to talk to. I anxiously gripped my “FREE STUFF” sign as I approached two punk rock teenagers, geared with my bright green outreach bag that contained 400 wristbands, 484 pieces of literature and hundreds of stickers that read “Wear Your Own Skin, Not Animals.” The talking points I had vigorously studied for the past couple of weeks with the peta2 crew inundated my mind. Instead of stressing about planning what to say, I realized that connecting on a personal level was probably more valuable than any statistic.
“Hi, my name is Tessa,” I quickly blurted out. “I’m here with peta2 to expose the merciless exploitation of animals in the animal skins industries. In the fur industry, for instance, it can take up to 100 animals to make one fur coat. Beavers, foxes, minks, raccoons, and even rabbits, dogs and cats are all used to make fur products.” A sense of satisfaction swelled up inside my body as I elicited the reaction I had hoped for. The teenagers were especially disgusted by the exploitation of rabbits, cats and dogs, immediately relating the abuse to their beloved domesticated animals at home. The rest of my talkwent over pretty well. I gave a couple more talking points, and when I was done, the two eagerly complied to help out in exchange for the free items, by texting into our petition asking UGGs to make a vegan pair of shoes.
While I was comforted by my first success doing outreach, I couldn’t help but feel guilty for giving into the teenagers’ speciesist mentality. For those of you unaware, speciesism is a term that is used, among its various definitions, to talk about the prejudice against non-human animals. By setting the rabbits, dogs and cats aside from the other animals, I allowed the teenagers to hold their affinities toward domesticated animals. Of course, I mentioned somewhere in my shpiel that no animal (or human for that matter) deserves to be exploited in such inhumane ways because you know, neck-breaking, drowning, beating and strangulation are pretty unnecessary, evil ways of killing animals for their fur.
In America, our relationship with animals is pretty consistent in its inconsistencies. While we treat some as family, we eat others on a daily basis without thinking about the blood on our hands. Our domestication of animals fuels our speciesist mentality. So then why is it that the domestication of chickens results in death while the domestication of dogs results in love and affection?
Rather than get into a historical discussion of how we hunted animals for survival and how those traits have shaped our culture, let’s focus on why we continue to maintain our discriminatory treatment of animals.
Why would most of us rather eat a cow than a cat? Is there anything fundamentally different between these two animals? Both are intelligent, sentient mammals like we are.
What’s even weirder about our human relationship with animals is that it’s not consistent across cultures. In China, for instance, it’s normal practice to eat dogs and cats in Jordan, camels serve as avid modes of transportation and food, and in India, cows are revered.
Cultural relativism helps us examine the reason for the worldwide ethical discourse relating to animals. Ultimately, there is no standard of truth in humanity. We base our ethics off of our nomos, or our social customs. Our habit of basing our ethics off of culture rather than nature, or both, enables us to move past our ethnocentric bubbles.
The lens cultural relativism offers begs me to question how can we make sense of the world when there is no objective truth? Is the answer to simply perform socially approved habits? Such as bonding with dogs while eating pig flesh?
Quite frankly, the answer is no. I’m not asking you to try the morbid unthinkable by eating a variety of animals you wouldn’t normally eat. What we need to do is closely re-examine our ethics, asking ourselves why we discriminate against animals, and why we go so far as to violently slaughter many of them for food, clothing and experimentation, among other issues. Instead of acting out of violence, living in harmony with nature is at the core of the advancement of our ethics.

Photo courtesy of Skylar GreyGrey-test hits · Skylar Grey rose to fame from singing on tracks such as “Coming Home.” After a successful debut album, the singer songwriter is back with her second album, titled Natural Causes.
Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Skylar Grey is releasing her second studio album Natural Causes on Sept. 23, and begins her national tour next week. Three years after her last album, Grey hopes to deliver a more mature sound in this album. Grey has collaborated with Eminem, X Ambassadors, Big Sean and more, and fans can look forward to hearing more collaborations on her new album.
Daily Trojan: How would you describe your new album and what would you tell your fans to expect?
Skylar Grey: The album is titled Natural Causes. The title is inspired by the natural beauty around me, I live in Park City, Utah. It’s a beautiful place for me to be creative and think. The morbid aspect of the title Natural Causes, to me, represents the darkness of the sound of the album.
DT: What’s the biggest difference between your last album that was released in 2013 and this one?
SG: I definitely think this album is a little bit more mature, a little darker. I put a lot more energy into the songs. I wrote a lot of the songs from the ground up. With the last album, I was given a lot of tracks to write to, and with this album, I was in the room, with the producers, creating the track from scratch. So there’s a lot more heart and soul, I think, in this.
DT: Which track are you most excited for fans to hear?
SG: My favorite track on the album, personally, is “Picture Perfect.” It’s the first time I feel like I’ve accomplished the sound I’ve been striving for for years.
DT: What city are you most looking forward to playing on the tour?
SG: That’s a tough question, because every time I go on tour, a different city is the best on that tour.
DT: What have been some of your favorite cities to play in?
SG: I always love playing in Chicago and Oregon, because I get to see family, I also love playing in New York.
DT: What song is on repeat for you right now?
SG: I don’t really get into new music very often. I get stuck on my favorite records, so the music I’ve been listening to lately is the same as what I’ve been listening to for the past five years. But my favorites are Bon Iver, Kendrick Lamar and Radiohead.
DT: What kind of artist do you hope your fans see you as after this album and this tour?
SG: That’s an interesting question. I guess I just want my fans to realize that you can’t put me in a box. I’m always going to push the boundaries creatively. And I hope that gets them excited for what I’m going to do in the future.
DT: Your collaborations have always been incredibly successful. Who’s one artist that you hope to work with in the future?
SG: My dream collaboration right now is Kendrick Lamar.

DT: What advice would you give many aspiring musicians at USC?
SG: I have so many things I could say. I guess, the biggest thing, is don’t lose yourself in the game. It can be very hard and you can feel a lot of rejection, but don’t let all of that turn you into something you’re not. Stay true to yourself creatively because that is the most interesting artist or songwriter you can be. It’s the authentic, original version of you.

There may be no maxim that millennials are more familiar with than this: “The internet is forever.” In an age of screenshots and retweets, internet ephemera is almost instantly transformed into something more permanent that can be shared weeks, months and even years after the original posting. For most of us, this translates to concern over employers finding old Facebook statuses. These stakes are amplified for celebrities. Last week ,after actress Lena Dunham faced accusations of racism over her statements about Odell Beckham Jr.’s behavior toward her at the Met Gala, Twitter users unearthed one of Dunham’s tweets from 2011 in which Dunham makes a racist comment about Asian men. Despite its age, the racist, resurfaced tweet was shared across a variety of tabloids. But embarrassing, problematic or offensive social media posts are not exclusively a problem for college students or celebrities. In fact, the haunting nature of tweets — their ability to resurface at a moment’s notice, their imperviousness to deletion — can cause quite a headache for politicians in their potential to completely re-define the term flip-flop. 
Flip-flopping is inevitable. All politicians have “evolved” on an issue at one point or another. And yet, accusing one’s opponent of being a flip-flopper can still cause irreparable damage. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney struggled to escape the media’s narrative of him as a flip-flopper. In this election, many seem unwilling to welcome Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s reversal on issues like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or even marriage equality. Flip-flopping produces legitimate concerns about authenticity, pandering and truthfulness; however, it also produces room for debate. For example, should we forgive legislators for votes they cast that, only in hindsight, were revealed as clearly not in the best interest of the country? Should we fault politicians for changing their positions as the tide of public opinion shifts? 
But this election, perhaps for the first time, produces a new question: How and when should candidates be held accountable for what they tweet? Is retracting a tweet the same as a flip flop? Of course, Clinton’s Twitter account making a tone-deaf tweet about student debt and emojis is clearly in a different category than her vote for the invasion of Iraq in 2002. However, candidates must be held accountable for their positions, whether made known on the floor of Congress or on their Twitter timeline. 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may as well be running as @realDonaldTrump. His Twitter account has been and continues to be a central part of his 2016 bid for presidency. It has helped forge his reputation as someone who speaks his mind; it has also been one of the main sources of Trump’s racist, xenophobic, anti-semitic and sexist attacks. Regardless of the medium, bigotry should be taken seriously and condemned by the American public. However, the gray area is whether Trump’s tweets should be treated like policy proposals. 
In a recent interview with Trump, Matt Lauer asked him about a tweet he made more than three years ago: “26,000 unreported sexual assults (sic) in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?” Even putting aside the typo, this tweet doesn’t look like it belongs in the same category as a policy proposal. Trump is not even explicitly suggesting that women be disallowed from serving in the military. In fact, Trump clarified in his interview with Lauer, perhaps to avoid looking like a flip-flopper, that he is not suggesting that women are unfit for military service. However, if we want to continue holding politicians accountable for what they’ve said in interviews and how they have voted on previous legislation, then it would be irresponsible to simply ignore Trump’s tweet.
Trump’s tweet is misogynistic and rests on misconceptions perpetuated by rape culture. He places the blame of sexual assault on women serving in the military, rather than on a culture which ignores survivors of sexual assault and protects the perpetrators. He dangerously gives credit to the myth that men simply can’t help themselves and that if a woman is raped then it was probably because she was somewhere she wasn’t supposed to be. 
In certain situations, picking one tweet out of more than 30,000 would be unfair. Evolution on an issue is natural. Admitting one’s mistakes and genuinely making amends should be lauded, not always dismissed as political maneuvering. However, when a presidential candidate tweets an opinion about a serious political issue, regardless of how spontaneous or offhand the comment may seem, it should be treated like any other public statement. In 2016, the American public must wrestle with our candidate’s tweets just as seriously as we would with their voting records.

Americans have long been struggling with obesity. In a report from earlier this month, researchers found that every single state has an obesity rate more than 20 percent, while four states maintain a rate over 35 percent. Even with the knowledge that the child obesity rate has leveled off (and the adult rate is beginning to do the same), this information is not easy to stomach. When diagnosing the root cause of the obesity epidemic in the United States, the first major culprit is food policy and the way that independent research meant to educate the public has been intentionally slanted by larger food industries with greater finances and political clout. Especially considering the arguably unhealthy options that are popular at USC (Panda Express, the Habit, California Pizza Kitchen), it is necessary for our students as well as the surrounding L.A. community to take nutritional information and health education into further consideration.
 Recent events have brought this even closer to the forefront. A study was released just this week that found a pair of Harvard researchers were paid money by professionals in the sugar industry to “tone down” their findings and downplay the relationship between sugars and coronary heart disease. They accepted, and in 1967 their report was published. Shifting blame away from sugars, the study instead placed a majority of the blame on saturated fats. The implications of these lies, some 50 years later, call into question the integrity of the entirety of the food processing industry.
 Nutrition science was essentially created to promote the best metabolic practices for people and to educate the public on those practices. If some of the most prominent nutrition professors go behind the scenes and rewrite the scripts even slightly, it becomes decidedly more difficult to decipher which statements are true and which are false.
 In South Los Angeles, the results of the food industry influence ring loud and clear. The area around our own campus is a “food desert,” in which there are very few, if any, grocery stores with access to affordable and quality produce. Without correct information, the medical industry and insurance regulations also lead Americans to suffer consequences. Preventable health care has to recognize that sugar is a major player in problems like coronary heart disease, instead of just the saturated fats that took all the blame.
 This evidence is pretty easy to come by, though. A study by the California Center for Public Health Advocacy in 2008 found that unsurprisingly, state counties “with the highest ratios of fast-food outlets also had some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes.” 
 All of the doubt surrounding nutrition standards does not bode well for food deserts. This is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that the food industry is called into question. And even though this particular claim is new, there have already been dozens of speculations, from criticism to uncertainty. Nutrition expert Marion Nestle, Ph.D. explained that this level of sponsorship questions public trust, creates public confusion and muddles documents like the Dietary Guidelines, which are written with the purpose of advising the public on what to eat. There is no guarantee, without better counsel, that areas like South Los Angeles will improve their eating patterns on their own, and evidence of such harmful influence can only worsen the situation.
 However, the situation can be solved through other means. Nonprofit research organization RAND Corp found a positive correlation between placing a grocery store in a food desert and better dietary intake among the inhabitants of the area. This data seems pretty intuitive, but the reasoning behind the change is anything but. According to the study conducted in Pittsburgh, patterns changed after the community (previously a food desert) built a grocery store, but that did not mean more people were actually shopping at the grocery store. Instead, this community benefited most from advocacy efforts that included marketing and awareness in addition to the grocery store’s broader selection of food items.
 Obesity is a public health issue, and like most public health issues, it cannot be solved by just one action — even if that action is as well-meaning as introducing fresh food into an environment. Most public health issues must be tackled through public education, and obesity is no different. 
Finally, it remains clear that this now-famous falsified study brings into question the conflicting roles of independent researchers. On the one hand, they are responsible to the public for unbiased information, but on the other hand, they serve individual interests. This reconciliation can often be concerning, especially if the long-term health and diet of the American public are at stake.

Pankaew Boonbaichaiyapruk | Daily TrojanPanelists at Tuesday’s “Road to the White House” event spoke about the high disapproval ratings of both candidates in the 2016 election.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a “Road to the White House” event Tuesday to discuss the The event featured a panel consisting of Anthony Boulahoud, a member of the USC College Democrats; Robert Shrum, who serves as the USC Dornsife Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics; Mary Perez, Vice President of the USC College Republicans and Brian Calle, an opinion editor for The Orange County Register. Moderators included Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Lily Vaughan, editorial director at the Daily Trojan. 
The panel started with a discussion about the presidential nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and how they have approached their campaigns in what has become one of the most unprecedented campaigns ever. The panel discussed what Calle called a “coin flip election,” because of both candidates’ high disapproval ratings. Clinton and Trump are the most unpopular presidential candidates in the last 30 years. Clinton holds a 59 percent disapproval rating among voters and Trump has a 60 percent disapproval rating among voters. 
In several recent national polls, Trump and Clinton were virtually tied. Over the past few months, both presidential candidates have suffered from backlash from party voters and the media. Clinton won the Democratic presidential primary against Senator Bernie Sanders, who had gained a large following of supporters, while Trump obtained the Republican nomination despite making headlines for derogatory comments and receiving backlash from voters and the media.  
The panel agreed that this presidential election will be a monumental one, while Boulahoud and Calle argued whether it was better to vote for “the lesser of the two evils” or for a third party candidate. Shrum spoke on the third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein and their own campaigns, but said that he does not believe that the third party candidates will have an effect on the final outcome of the election.
“I believe that Hillary Clinton is going to win, and I think that … the debate will have a huge impact because people will be so fascinated by these two candidates and the third parties will begin to fade,” Shrum said.
Carlos Yeh, a graduate student studying International Public Policy and Management, attended the event and said,  
“I think it’s great because they invited both supporters of the Republican and Democratic parties, and they can at least agree that they don’t support Donald Trump. They are bringing different perspectives from different groups and it’s really interesting. Especially listening to people who have so many years of experience in politics.” 
Lily Vaughan, who served as moderator for the panel said, “It was great, especially hearing from both sides of the panel and especially when we’re talking to such intelligent people, and as a moderator it’s always fun to ask the questions and hear the responses. Everyone’s opinion is changed because of where they come from and the education they receive and just how Dan said it’s about everyone looking at the same problem and coming to different conclusions. So you know as a political science major, as an editor it’s always nice to hear everyone’s opinion and really see where our country is at right now and how we can move forward. 
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics will continue to hold a “Road to the White House Series” event every week throughout the semester fro 6-7 at the Ground Zero Cafe.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted the “Future of Energy” forum on Tuesday night in the Wallis Annenberg Hall lobby. The panel aimed to discuss the transition of energy in the coming years to meet the needs of a growing global population and to address some of the major environmental challenges of our time.
The panel was moderated by Fred Cook, Director of the USC Center for Public Relations and the CEO of Golin, a global public relations firm. Panelists included Dr. Don Paul, executive director of the USC Energy Institute; Niel Golightly, VP of energy transition strategy, U.S., Shell Oil Company; and Brenna Clairr O’Tierney, an External Relations Advisor for Shell and an Annenberg alumna.
One of the central topics of the discussion was the time it may take for a transition towards renewable energy sources and away from traditional fossil fuels to occur, in an effort to curb global climate change and reduce pollutants and emissions. In spite of decades of effort by the government and corporations like Shell, the majority of energy in the U.S. is still derived from sources like coal, oil and natural gas, among others.
“The challenge in all of these transitions is that, for the better part of 150 years, the U.S. has had consistently low energy prices,” Paul said. “We’ve built our system around this for decades.The fundamental challenge is changing people’s attitudes toward energy, transportation and where they live. That’s why the transition is so long, even if you have a technical fix.”
Another key aspect of the conversation was the potential of international agreements to play a role in altering the trend towards increasing fossil fuel consumption, as well as overall energy use.
“Could international agreements converge around an environment that drove the system uniformly, which is what you need to do? They could, but historically they haven’t,” Paul said. “The problem with something of this scale, which will take decades [to solve] no matter what you do, is that things intervene. You can have a major war that intervenes, a major depression [etc.].”
Golightly brought up some of the difficulties faced by companies like Shell to invest in renewable energy sources, one of which is the conflict between shareholders and stakeholders.
“We’re caught in a strange predicament,” Golightly said. “A lot of our stakeholders are saying ‘invest more in wind and solar,’ while many of our investors are saying ‘don’t… invest in [renewables]’… So we look at ways that we can monetize and create value in wind and solar. It may be through joint ventures, or through certain parts of the wind and solar value chain. There are lots of other ways to look at how we can do right by our investors and still be in those businesses.”
Students who attended the panel were impressed by Shell’s commitment to renewable resources, which they said changed their views on an industry that can often be perceived as doing more harm than good to the environment.
“I think with any oil company there’s this sense of distrust with the public,” said Brittany Stamoulis, a first-year graduate student studying strategic public relations. “But it was really nice to see their corporate and social responsibility, and how they’re actually trying to make the future brighter.”
Golightly and O’Tierney also highlighted Shell’s desire to recruit younger working people, who are often drawn towards other industries like technology, which many students appreciated.
“I really like how they’re encouraging millennials to join their company,” Stamoulis said. “They’re seeing the impact of millennials and are trying to get them on board and involved in the change they’re doing.”

While virtual reality (VR) seems to be all around Los Angeles this year in the form of Google Cardboards and Samsung Gear VR’s, there is another immersive technology that may become even more impactful. Augmented reality (AR) is slowly emerging as an area of heavy investment in the tech industry, and it can already be found all over USC’s campus ‑ not to mention as a key hidden addition to the recently-announced iPhone 7 Plus.
For those not yet familiar with devices like the Microsoft HoloLens or Meta 2, augmented reality refers to the technique of overlaying digital images and information onto the real, three-dimensional world in front of one’s eyes. This creates what’s perceived as “holograms” that can be interacted with as easily as one would with a touch screen. Imagine seeing walking directions as a colorful path on the sidewalk in front of you, or picture seeing your friends sitting around your living room and talking while they’re thousands of miles away. New technology will allow us to display these images on AR headsets (few of which are currently commercially available) or simply on a smartphone screen, in an albeit less present way.
Many companies took notice of this summer’s success of Pokemon Go as it brought basic AR to many people by overlaying digital Pokemon onto the real world. Just last week on Sept. 7, Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, casually mentioning that they are adding dual cameras to the Plus. What they didn’t mention was that dual cameras allow a computer to sense depth, similar to the two eyes of humans. A depth-sensing iPhone may then be able to understand 3D environments around it and use that information to create augmented experiences. Apple CEO Tim Cook himself recently said that Apple is “investing heavily in AR.”
Some students and faculty at USC believe that AR has the potential to completely replace the screens that we use to interact with our computers. Scott Fisher, Dean of Research at the School of Cinematic Arts, directed a program at NASA that developed the first immersive interfaces to be used by astronauts to interact with computers in space. Now, he runs a USC research lab with a focus on immersive technologies. His longtime colleague Mark Bolas has been called “an expert on virtual and augmented reality” by the New York Times and had mentored a young VR enthusiast named Palmer Luckey before he founded Oculus.
The most exciting part about the development of AR at USC isn’t what the amazing faculty has already done, but what’s sure to come. A plethora of research opportunities for students and faculty, as well as organizations like the USC Institute of Creative Technologies and the Blackstone LaunchPad, create a laser-focused culture around developing the prototypes that will one day evolve into tools that we use every day. Student startup teams at VRSC (Editor Note: Ilia Labkovsky is the Vice President of VRSC), the immersive tech student organization, continue to create projects in their free time that even large companies can’t seem to wrap their heads around. It’s an exciting time for this new technology at SC, and it’s the perfect time for interested students to get involved.

As an Indian American wandering through Scotland, there isn’t a lot I find familiar. Instead of finding the local Ralph’s, I’m at the neighborhood Tesco trying to figure out what an aubergine is. Already, I’ve gotten lost countless times on the streets that change names every few feet, and the California sunshine I’ve come to know and love has been replaced by a perpetual gray.
But the one familiar thing I have found is Indian food — a lot of Indian food. It seems as though for every Scottish pub and burger joint, there’s a Mother India or Mumbai Mansion right next door. It’s a surprising taste of the spices back home in a place laden with meat, potatoes and salt. Scotland even has National Curry Week next month. From a culinary perspective, it makes sense; Spice-laden curries are the stark opposite of traditional Scottish cuisine, often criticized for its blandness.
But Scotland isn’t exactly a “brown town” — in fact, a massive 96 percent of its population is white. Historically, the appetite for curry in the West was born out of the spice trade but rose in the 19th Century, and today much of the UK’s Indian cuisine has adapted to European tastes (read: bland). The Scots have retained their love affair with the cuisine from the former British colony, with whom flourishing trade enabled their growing political power. Indeed, modern Scottish-Indian food is a prime example of how centuries-old political history affects aspects of cultural life today. Even though the power disparity between a colony and its colonizer could not have been wider, colonization left each nation with cultural remnants for centuries to come — for India, it was cricket and tea, and for the UK, it was Indian food.
Even to a tourist, it’s clear that Indian cuisine plays an extraordinary role in Scottish life. Given its history, I’m confronted with the question: Is Indian food in Scotland more Indian or Scottish?
The Scottish newspaper, The Glasgow Times, put it this way: “Perhaps it’s time we learned from them and started to regard Indian food as ours, as part of our own culinary culture, rather than some sort of exotic otherness that we have no stake in.”
Maybe for such a hallmark of Indian culture to flourish in a largely white nation, it requires either an exoticized perspective or a complete co-optation. The scenario bears parallels to other outcries of food appropriation. As a writer recently wrote on the appropriation of pho in America, “western countries have long adopted and profited from developing nations’ dishes, sometimes exoticizing and fetishizing them in the process, and failing to give due credit to the originators.”
What’s missing in the reimagining of ethnic foods in Scotland and elsewhere is a renewed appreciation of the origins and evolution of the cuisine itself.
