Every blog said to pack lightly. Every travel website recommended the max amount of weight should be 15 pounds. Everyone told us to avoid bringing too many clothes. But it’s winter, and we thought it was smart to have many layers. And it’s Europe, where people are always dressed so nicely, and we were going to be in so many photo ops it was impossible to pack lightly. 
So now we have to carry 30-pound duffle bags on our backs and hope they don’t break. (Our backs that is.)
It’s only been four days and we’ve already had to run with them through the rain, trek them up what seemed like an eternity of stairs and lock them up in hostel lockers that were only half their size. Backpacking through Europe has been quite an experience so far.
And we’ve still got two cities to go!
The first place we went to was Geneva, Switzerland, where my friend, Jessica, is studying abroad. She landed herself an internship at a United Nations agency this spring and will be spending the rest of the semester in business formal attire proudly sporting her UN badge through the grandiose hallways of the Palace Des Nations.
During our time in Geneva, Jessica was busy finishing her finals week at the University of Geneva, so I had to venture out on my own to explore the city.
For all you travelers out there, here are two apps that I used and that will make your vacations a whole lot easier:
I downloaded both of these on my phone, plugged in my headphones and went out to explore the little Swiss city. 
Geneva is a tiny town that lies on the shores of Lake Geneva, a beautiful lake that is home to the famous fountain, the Jet d’Eu. What was most surprising was how the city was so clean and quiet during my whole stay there. Everything in Geneva works to perfection, from their bus system, to their laws and their conducts. Everyone is spotlessly dressed and on their best behavior around the clock. Definitely nothing like what I’m used to in L.A. The city is so orderly that is actually made me miss LA’s chaos and personality.

The day Jessica finished her final exams, we took an EasyJet flight to Berlin. 
Our first impression of the German capital was scary. We got yelled at by not one, but two Germans and yet, to this day, we still don’t know what we did wrong, or what they were yelling about. Everything is gray, and the fact that it was raining and cloudy while we were there was definitely not helping. However, the rich history that the city contains cannot be compared to anywhere else. We stood where Hitler first declared war, where he allegedly committed suicide and where Ronald Reagan famously yelled “Tear Down This Wall!” In two days, we lived through decades of history, war and massacre and left the place in awe.

The next few days will probably be spent in a havoc, running through Prague, Budapest and Vienna, trying to handle all their different currencies and languages and, like always, laughing through it all.

Undergraduate Student Government Program Board Finance Director and President-elect Edwin Saucedo, Chief of Staff David Moreno and current USG Vice President Jordan Fowler presented a proposal to the USG Senate to reorganize USG administrative positions at the Senate meeting Tuesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The bylaw changes consisted of a 91-page online document that would centralize responsibility in the organization. There will be several executive branches such as a communications branch, which will be responsible for communication across all USG organizations including Program Board, Community Affairs and other USG-related groups.
Senator Chris Fong voiced concerns with the reorganization and the potential elimination of positions within USG, as opposed to simple restructuring.
“I wanted to clarify, are any positions being eliminated? And if so, which ones?” Fong said.
Saucedo explained that some branches would be dismantled and reorganized into new positions, such as Program Board communications, which would be consolidated under a general USG Communications branch. Redundant positions would be reconsidered.
“All of Program Board marketing is being eliminated; Program Board graphics, videography and photography are all being eliminated and consolidated under the Communications branch,” Saucedo said. “All the same roles will continue into next year; they will just be rearranged to different people.”
Fowler and Saucedo were unsure about the exact number of positions that will be created compared to those that will be eliminated, leaving potential for positional losses within USG.
“We have to look up the exact numbers; we haven’t calculated them side by side.” Saucedo said.
Brianna Thorpe, director of community affairs, welcomed the changes because of the fluidity of communication offered by the reorganization. Thorpe recalled situations where the nature of USG worked against event planning on campus.
“I’m just so used to seeing it separate,” Thorpe said. “I think in terms of marketing and events, I support [the reorganization] because there have been times where I had an event or something I was working on, and I reached out to Program Board to promote it to the student body, but they considered themselves separate. I’m hoping, logistically, everything will make sense.”
The Senate meeting ended with a question on funding from Senator Aaron Rifkind. Rifkind asked about the funding plans for new positions in USG, considering current bylaws base funding off the amount of position held in USG.
“How does this affect funding? Because in the very last page of the bylaws, right now, it’s a set amount of people. So if we’re allowing for flexibility, how is that going to work with funding?” Rifkind asked.
Fowler explained that hiring is largely at the discretion of the USG President and Vice President.
“Last year with hiring, it was up to Rini and I to figure out how to break down co-directors versus assistants versus associates,” Fowler said. “So it’s up to [the next administration] to check and balance.”

As a child, Logan Heley remembers being pulled out of school by his parents to engage in the political process. He often volunteered with his parents on long campaigns before following them to the ballot box where they cast their votes.
But this election season, Heley’s parents will have the opportunity to vote for their son.
In January, Heley announced his candidacy for the 21st Kansas State Senate District, which includes portions of Heley’s hometown, Overland Park.
Heley left Overland Park in 2011 to attend USC, where he was active in Undergraduate Student Government, the Joint Educational Project and the Sigma Nu fraternity. He graduated in 2015 with degrees in journalism and history.
After leaving Los Angeles, Heley completed an internship at the White House’s press office before returning to Kansas. Closely following the events in his hometown — including the elections of Governor Sam Brownback and incumbent Senator Greg Smith — Heley jumped into the race to challenge Smith’s bid for a second term.
“I didn’t like the direction that my home state was heading [in] and felt that it was important for me to come back and try to get our state back on the right track and moving forward,” Heley said.
Throughout his time in USG, Heley was involved in a multi-year effort to convince university administration to provide gender-neutral housing on campus.
Those efforts culminated after Heley had finished his term as a Greek Senator. In April 2014, then-USG Vice President Rini Sampath and Senator Brianna Thorpe introduced a resolution to support gender-neutral housing that was passed unanimously.
“USC is behind a lot of other comparable universities on gender-neutral housing, and it’s about time we as a Trojan Family make our home comfortable for all students,” Heley said when the resolution was passed.
Now, Heley is campaigning on issues such as fiscal stability, job growth and education for an entire state.
Heley’s campaign has been met with the support of various local officials and past officeholders, including former Congressman Dennis Moore.
“When I retired I said a new generation of leadership would lead Kansas in the future, and Logan is part of that generation,” Moore said in an endorsement statement for Heley’s campaign.
As the campaign season heats up, Heley expects to face opposition to his candidacy over issues such as his youth. However, Heley encourages others his age to run for office and participate in politics.
“I think that young people should be encouraged to go and run for office,” Heley said. “I really believe that it is going to take young people to win back my state specifically, [and] I think my age is an advantage, personally.”
Beyond Kansas, Heley has received considerable support — financial and personal — from generations of USC Trojans.
“They talk about the Trojan Family at every event possible at USC, and it really is the case,” Heley said.
Those interested in participating in or to contributing Heley’s campaign can find his Facebook page or visit his website, loganheley.com.
“I am the underdog, but it’s a race that we can win,” Heley said.

Move over Instagram, a new app created by USC alumnus Christopher Karimian is aiming to change the way people engage with photos.
Splore — a mobile app where users discover and discuss trending photos — is currently in beta and will be launched on Feb. 29. Users will be able to share, interact and make their own content trend through upvotes.
Karimian said the app will allow users to follow hashtags related to their interests, rather than people, and view content based on it, which sets it apart from other similar apps.
“They will receive a stream of photos on their news feed that have the hashtags they follow,” said Karimian, the CEO. “The second thing that is different is that every post you receive is new. You are not tied down to any person, and you discover people much better.”
The news feed is limitless on Splore. New photos will appear on the screen every time a photo is posted with the hashtag a user is following. Karimian said that it makes the app unique.
“On Instagram, when your feed runs out, and you are still bored, you can always go on Splore, where your feed will never end,” Karimian said.
Muhammad Mustafa Zaffer, a senior majoring in business administration and a business operations and strategy analyst for Splore, sees the importance of using ideas to create a news feed.
“On Splore, you are subscribed to a favorite idea of yours,” Zaffer said.
An algorithm picks out the best photo based on upvotes regardless of the amount of followers the profile has.
“A person should go viral based on the content they have,” Zaffer said. “This is a platform where you can take an interest in every photo that you see.”
Splore concentrates on building social engagement by linking a person’s profile to other social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and SoundCloud. Social engagement will benefit photographers at USC and abroad, Zaffer said, who can reach a larger audience through the app.
“As a business developer, I have reached out to photographers from all over the world, including Hong Kong, Pakistan, Middle East and the Philippines,” Zaffer said. “We have photographers from USC, who are food bloggers and are interested in just jumping onto the platform as soon as we launch because they know that their content is really good, and they can go viral within our hashtags.”
The discussion section about photos on Splore is important to the app’s function and has been given high priority by Splore’s programmers. Users can comment and vote on particular photos on Splore.
“We want to be cutting-edge on social media,” Karimian said. “In the comments section, we have comments being pulled from the database and laid out on an overlay, and this hasn’t been done before, until Yifan, our coder did it.”
Yifan Zhou, the alumnus of the class of 2015, was involved with the front-end coding, which is the main part of the app and includes multiple gestures, multi-threading, animation and parallax viewing. He designed an algorithm to calculate the popularity of each image dynamically.
Splore has seen success in competition with other start-ups. It was nominated as an alpha startup and best tech startup at the Web Summit and Timmy Awards, respectively.
“This experience was overwhelming,” Zaffer said. “I applied to Web Summit and aced the interview. They invited us to the conference, and when we attended it, the response we got was phenomenal.”
Samy Abbas, the head of product and design at Splore, was at the company from the beginning and designed and built the app around exploring photos. After receiving funding, he began work on making the interface more user oriented.
“I came up with ‘Splore’ because it’s a play on words for “Explore,” since that is what you’ll be doing all day long in the app — exploring the world’s photos,” Abbas said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “[User Interface] is the fun part. This is where I began to think about all the intricate but simple animations that one will find all throughout our app.”
Karimian wants to provide users with the best product and then work backward from there.
“Our ultimate goal is to provide you with the best possible feed,” Karimian said. “We would give you the posts on your feed based on your interests. Right now, we are under the minimum viable product model, where we want to get the product out and make sure people love it and add these additional features at the end.”
I downloaded the app, it is has been a great experience so far!

The men’s volleyball team heads up to UC Santa Barbara to face the No. 8 Gauchos on Wednesday.
USC (3-11, 3-9 MPSF) is coming off of a 5-set upset over then-ranked No. 5 Hawaii. Senior outside hitter Alex Slaught looks to use the victory as motivation.
“I think it’s something that we can use to build some momentum for the rest of the season going forward,” Slaught said.
In the win against Hawaii, junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder put up a season-high 21 kills. His cousin, sophomore setter Jack Yoder, put up a season-high 56 assists.
Lucas Yoder talked about how important it was to get the win over the Rainbow Warriors and how it was fun to put up good numbers alongside his cousin.
“I’ve played on every team with [Jack],” Lucas Yoder said. “He’s a really fun setter to play with.”
Jack Yoder pointed out how the team is continuing to improve.
“We’re playing better each game and we’re finding that rhythm,” Jack Yoder said. “It’s good to see out here.”
The last time the Trojans and the Gauchos met, USC hosted UCSB ((11-6, 7-5 MPSF), but fell to them in four sets (22-25, 25-23, 22-25, 23-25).
Slaught and Yoder led USC with 16 kills each. Senior middle blocker Tommy Leonard put up 11 kills in the match.
Plenty has changed for the Trojans since the last time they faced the Gauchos. Notably, junior middle blocker Andy Benesh has returned to the lineup. Despite playing five less matches than the rest of the starters, Benesh is second on the team in blocks with 30, while averaging .77 blocks per set. Leonard leads the team with 47 blocks, averaging .85 per set.
Benesh brings more than just a strong defensive presence, he also brings offensive aggressiveness. The junior has 64 kills on the season while hitting .364, the team’s second highest hitting percentage.
One factor that has been in the Trojans’ favor recently is the team’s ability to come into the match at anytime. Head coach Jeff Nygaard has been playing around with lineups and making substitutions throughout matches.
Slaught credits the team’s ability to always being ready and “comfortable” to go in.
“We all do a good job of when our number is called, just coming in and doing our job,” Slaught said. “I think it’s a strength that we can work off of for the rest of the season.”
For the Gauchos, redshirt junior opposite Matt Marsh led the team during the last matchup with 19 kills and 3 aces. Marsh leads his team with 202 kills on the season, a 38 kill difference from the second highest. The Trojans will have to utilize the blocking they’ve begun to build up over the last few matches to limit Marsh.
USC has continued to put work in during practice. Since their win against Hawaii, they’ve had an eight-day break following a homestand of four matches in seven days. Despite their losing record, the team is confident that their hard work will start to pay off.
“This team works hard every single day,” Slaught said. “It hasn’t shown on the court, but we know we’re getting better and we’re working as hard as we can.”
The Trojans face the Gauchos Wednesday night at 7 p.m. in Santa Barbara.
The season was resumed the way it was left even less. Swept by UCSB showed no improvement in play.
Something definitely missing in team chemistry and coaching.

For all intents and purposes, the women’s swimming and diving team has had a good season. They concluded the regular season 8-2 overall, with an impressive 6-1 record in conference dual meets, and their swimmers boast some of the top times in the country. Beginning this week, however, “good” will not be enough for the fourth-ranked squad.
They want to be great.
Beginning on Wednesday, the Trojans will compete with some of the top swim programs in the country for the right to be called the Pac-12 champion. Their competition will include top-ranked Stanford, No. 6 Cal — who happens to be the two-time reigning conference champion, as well as the defending NCAA champion — as well as No. 14 Arizona and No. 19 UCLA. Unranked Arizona State, Oregon State, Washington State and Utah round out the field.
“As usual, the Pac-12 Swimming and Diving Championships is one of the toughest conference championships in the country,” head coach Dave Salo said. “We have been challenged and have met the challenges well.”
The challenges Salo refers to include dual meets against three ranked conference rivals: the team has already taken down Cal and Arizona but lost to Stanford by slim margins just a few weekends ago. In the postseason, though, the slate is wiped clean.
As the Trojans attempt to win the team championship, individual swimmers and divers will be working to make their way into the individual NCAA Championships.
USC boasts several freshmen swimmers that have a fighting chance at individual crowns, as well as some seasoned veterans who will look to build upon their success in past years. First-year transfer Anika Apostalon currently holds the 11th best time in the country for the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 48.11, and junior Chelsea Chenault is ranked 12th in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:55.58. Chenault, no stranger to postseason success, finished third last year at the Pac-12 Championships in the 500-yard freestyle and finished third in the 200-yard freestyle.
“We are most excited about this team being very balanced and that we won’t be relying on any one individual swimmer to lead our effort to the team championship,” Salo said. “[Our freshmen] have been outstanding in this campaign, and they have never shriveled under the pressure.”
While the young crop of stars bring a wealth of talent to the table, they don’t yet have any postseason experience under their belts. That’s where senior co-captains Lucy Worrall and Kendyl Stewart come in; the duo possess the leadership capabilities necessary to carry a team all the way through a grueling week of competition, and Stewart is back to defend her title in the 100-yard butterfly.
“Lucy Worrall and Kendyl Stewart have the experience to manage the emotions that we remain focused and undeterred,” Salo said. “We have a strong freshman class and great upperclass leadership that will help the team through the highs and lows of a meet like this.”
The Trojans placed third at last year’s Pac-12 Championships and have never won a conference title. USC has placed second six times in the conference playoffs, the most recent instance coming back in 2013 when the Trojans were defeated by the Stanford Cardinal by just 21 points — the closest margin of victory ever for the conference championships.
While Stewart, Worrall and others are competing in the lanes, the USC men’s and women’s diving teams will be squaring off against conference rivals on the diving boards to help add to their school’s point total.
The Trojans’ women’s diving team boasts the second-most diving titles in conference history, just behind Stanford, and will be led this year by senior Sam Adams, who has already captured six finals in her time at USC. Adams will be joined by Natalie Kalibat, Katherine Van Winkle and Jacqui Suitt, who will all be competing in their final conference championship. Freshman Madison Witt has led the team this season on the three-meter and platformand will hope to contribute strongly to the team’s point total over the coming week.
For the men, seniors Collin Pollard and Deon Reid and sophomore Dashiell Enos will look to score on the diving board. Pollard will look to cap off an already impressive Trojan career, which includes nine finals appearances in the Pac-12 Championships.
The events will run from Wednesday night until Saturday, with Thursday, Friday and Saturday’s action being broadcast live on the Pac-12 Network. On Sunday, individuals will have their last chance to post qualifying times for the NCAA Championships. All events will be held at the Weyerhaeuser King County Aquatic Center in Federal Way, Washington.

A year ago, just being there was special enough. Making it to the next step in the journey, the NCAA tournament, was enough. Winning a first-round playoff game and making it to a second-round matchup against powerhouse Duke was icing on the cake. The expectation wasn’t to come away with a win, but merely some program experience.
One offseason later, those expectations changed.
On Saturday, the USC women’s lacrosse team earned a rematch with those Duke Blue Devils. In a program-defining 11–5 upset win, the Women of Troy earned the program’s most significant victory in its short four-year history. It’s a remarkably good sign for what is potentially to come from this upstart program, as well as validation for the outgoing athletic department head who placed so much faith in it.
In its fourth official season as an NCAA Division I program, the USC women’s lacrosse team has joined the ranks of the top national programs. In its inaugural 2013 season, the team experienced some understandable growing pains and didn’t quite burst onto the national scene right out of the gate. A year later, while still growing, the Women of Troy have established themselves as a legitimate player in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference.
Last year, the Trojans nearly had its moment in the early season spotlight. Hosting national power Northwestern in the Coliseum, the Women of Troy mounted a serious upset bid against the Wildcats. Unfortunately, the upset was thwarted, and the Wildcats eventually came back to win in overtime. The Women of Troy fought hard all season to get into the national rankings, and they eventually authenticated a season of progress by making the NCAA tournament. A first round playoff win served as extra validation and earned the second round matchup with Duke. But the Blue Devils were too much for the Trojans at the time and eventually made it to the national semifinals after beating USC.
The Trojans did have the benefit of a home field in the rematch. Instead of flying across the country, the Women of Troy merely had to take a bus down to Orange County to meet the Blue Devils, who had to take the long cross-country flight this time. Nonetheless, a stifling defensive performance against the fifth-ranked Blue Devils proves that this Women of Troy team can truly beat anyone in the country.
When looking at the USC coaching staff, it’s no shock that the program has ascended to the top. As head coach, Lindsey Munday leads the Women of Troy, and is also the team captain of the women’s national team. With great facilities and a top-ranked school academically, USC has brought in some of the top recruits in the nation who may want to escape the ice cold weather typical at usual East Coast lacrosse powerhouses. The sky is the limit for this program — it helps being able to see that clear blue sky about 280 days a year — and the Trojans could legitimately win the national title sometime in the next five years.
Lacrosse is still a relatively obscure sport on campus despite the recent success. Like all non-revenue teams, it won’t dominate the headlines, even if it goes on a national championship run.
Nonetheless, it is a sign of how strong the overall athletic program at USC has become under athletic director Pat Haden. It won’t be as important as head football coach Clay Helton winning a national championship in his USC tenure, but Haden’s involvement in the success of the women’s lacrosse team shows that he knocked the ball out of the park with at least one program hire.
Though their success may not bring out thousands of fans like the football team’s spring game will, the Women of Troy’s success is certainly something to follow. The season is just getting started, but the team has already set a new standard for success going forward.

In a crowded field of fifteen schools at the Gold Rush in Seal Beach, the No. 1 USC women’s golf team stood head and shoulders above the rest.
Led by strong efforts from freshman Robynn Ree, sophomore Amy Lee and junior Tiffany Chan, the Trojans were the only team to finish the three-round tournament under par, finishing -1 after two days of action. Each of their round scores was better than any competitor’s, including a stellar finish of 285 in the second round.
The tournament’s runner-up — Fresno State — posted a +17, followed by host school Long Beach State, which finished at +26.. No.25 Brigham Young University, the only other ranked school, posted a +29, good for fifth in the tournament. USC was the only Pac-12 school to participate in the tournament.
Ree led the pack with a -4. She was consistent each round, posting scores of 70 and 71 on Monday and followed that performance with a score of 71 to finish out the tournament on Tuesday. Chan tied with Long Beach State’s Haley Tygret for the best single-round score when she finished with an impressive score of 68 in the second round.
Lee, the only Trojan competing as an individual, finished second overall in the tournament with a -3. Her score did not count toward the Trojans’ final tally.
Ree led the field for the entirety of the tournament, but some other Trojans weren’t as consistent. Junior Karen Chung fell four spots in the final round with a +4 finish, and senior Kyung Kim dropped nine spots with a +6. Gabriella Then, USC’s final golfer, finished at +10. Then, despite having the highest total on the team, still finished tied for 23rd in the tournament — USC was the only school to have all golfers finish in the top 25.
USC’s victory at the Gold Rush was the team’s third team title this season; they opened the season with a win at the Annika Intercollegiate and finished the fall season with a team victory in the East Lake Cup. Ree’s first-place finish was the second individual championship for a Trojan this season.
The Trojans set their sights now on the Darius Rucker Invitational, which will take place during the first week of March in Hilton Head, South Carolina.

The School of Dramatic Arts is ready to take a crack at French playwright Molière’s famous Les Femmes Savantes or The Learned Ladies. The play, which originally played in the Royal Palace of France in 1672 finds its way to the Bing Theater this weekend. The play is overflowing with satirical jokes on academic pretentiousness and female education — a can’t miss.
The play follows two young lovers, Henriette and Clitandre, who must overcome the mountain of doom: parental approval. (Being single and having no personal connection whatsoever to this predicament makes for an ever better reason to go — laughing at other people’s pain.) Henriette’s father and uncle are more than ready to give Henriette away, but her mother, aunt and sister favor another suitor: Trissotin, a pseudo-scholar and mediocre poet with lofty aspirations — think film production major. Trissotin has three lady friends — Henriette’s sister, aunt and mother — who worship the ground he places his oh-so-talented feet on. The “learned” ladies are drawn to him due to their own obsession with being as pretentious about art and culture as possible. They sound annoying, sure, but Molière isn’t known as a master comedian for nothing.
If laughing is not your cup of arthouse tea, then there seems to be little reason to see this play, but missing it would be unwise, given the director of the show.
SDA has brought in Michael Michetti, co-artistic director of zthe Theatre @ Boston Court in Pasadena, to direct the show. He’s a seasoned pro with credits like A Picture of Dorian Gray, Hamlet, and The Grapes of Wrath. He directed Tom Jacobson’s The Twentieth-Century Way, which recently had an acclaimed off-Broadway run at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater. The man has awards and experience, but the best part is that he’s a Trojan.
The play runs this Thursday, Friday, Saturday (two shows) and Sunday. The USC Ticket Office offers  tickets for $5 for students, $8 for faculty and staff and $10 for the general public. Online and phone purchases are $12.
Here are some other highlights for SDA:
Camille, another French love story (albeit much more depressing than Learned Ladies) is running March 3-6.
The Oresteia Project is the brainchild of director David Bridel and MFA acting class of 2016 acting students. The show draws on the trilogy of tragedies by Aeschylus but throws in modern twists. Running Feb. 13-March 3 in the Scene Dock Theatre.
Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992 features MFA actors in Anna Deavere Smith’s documentary theater work. Feb. 6–March 6 in the Scene Dock Theater.

I’ve been in love for most of my life. Not with a person or an idea or anything specific like that. It’s just a general feeling, a sensation of welling in my lungs. The objectlessness of it has made me restless at times and, at others, utterly convinced I was in the right place at the right time. That certainty burns just as brightly as the aimlessness does, but really, it all boils down to the same pervasive feeling of general, aching love.
Perhaps it is this perpetual blank affection that leaves me loving too long. I’ve never been in a relationship that wasn’t long distance at some point and at the end of each relationship, I have had the same bitter realization that it should have ended when one of us left. It seems natural in hindsight -— it should have never amounted to more than summer fun, a high school romance or a meaningless rebound. But in the heat of the moment, the welling gets the better of my judgment.
I’ve been loving that way for as long as I can remember. In elementary and middle school, I would harbor obsessive crushes that never materialized, not because of my lack of charm or attractiveness, but because I was terrified of destroying that distance. I’m not sure why. Maybe I was afraid I didn’t know how to conduct myself in romantic situations. Maybe I couldn’t bear the juvenile attention or “having a boyfriend.” More likely though, I think it was an inability to actually apply that over-arching love to someone — to let it escape the boundaries of myself.
I’m discovering that I still do that — love a lot but keep it contained. It is not that I don’t tell people that I value them or leave things left unsaid, but sometimes I think the love I feel for people stays mine — something I feel and not something inspired by someone else. It’s like this; I was cleaning out my junk drawers over the holidays and came upon a stack of postcards. They were signed with a name I didn’t recognize from places I couldn’t remember any of my friends going to. I looked at them, dumbstruck, for probably 10 minutes. It wasn’t until I said the name aloud that I remembered.
The merchant marine. We swam together in high school and fostered small, itching affection for each other. I lacked the confidence to obviously like anyone, and he was too religious to be openly fond of a staunch agnostic like me. But we adored each other, and when he graduated and set out for a year at sea, I was beside myself. I used to focus the full weight of my obsessive fantasies on those postcards — little glimmers that despite our distance and difference, something would come of our subtle romance.
Nothing ever did. I don’t think I ever saw him again, and I eventually hid him from my Facebook feed after one too many preachy posts. I didn’t feel bad about it. There were no lingering what-ifs. He had gone his way and me mine, and I had no desire to recross our paths. It was more of a disturbing astonishment that I could have completely forgotten someone who was so important to me once, that my hyperfocus on him could have been just me loving because that’s what I do.
I worry about that a lot now. There have been times recently when I have misremembered my number, and it’s not even in double digits. I used to want to be able to recognize the good times in every romance, to maintain a distant affection for everyone I used to love, but after finding the postcards, my hope is much simpler. I just want to remember. I don’t want to lose anyone like that, not after they’re already gone from my life.
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone lament that they can’t forget something, someone, some time in their lives. Remembering hurts, and it would be easier to go through life free and happy again, like it never happened. But forgetting someone completely like that is like losing a piece of yourself — part of your own history. I’m all for change, progression and moving on, but there’s something so aggressive about forgetting, like the end was not just a finale but an erasure, taking even more from you than the person themselves. Even if my love was always mine, never really applying to the object of my affection, I want to remember that time, that kind of love because I want to remember me.

Rachel Atherly | Daily Trojan
Adelanto, California, is not an ordinary American town.
A sleeping agrarian piece of land tucked away in the Mojave desert, the city has suddenly become the home of some of the most valued pieces of property in California. The recent move to permit commercial cultivation of marijuana has created a massive influx of business activity as businesses race toward using Adelanto’s land to build warehouses for growing operations.
The growth of Adelanto highlights unparalleled opportunities in federal marijuana policy. A previous prison town moving toward bankruptcy, the area is enjoying a considerable increase in real estate value as well as an eminently sustainable model of growth beyond selling its prisons to private incarceration companies. Federal legalization could help resolve prison overcrowding, funnel money into the American economy and act as a first step to break patterns for the policing in black and brown communities.
This California town is not an isolated case. The state of Colorado made more than $180 billion off of marijuana legalization, much of which is to be directed toward schools and — ironically — drug prevention programs. Expected revenues where marijuana is legalized are estimated to be a little more than $3 billion for all states collectively.
Federal policies, however, have consistently hindered progressive policy on marijuana. The current federal stance categorizes the substance as a Schedule I Controlled Substance, placing it in league with meth, heroin and methaqualone. Early investors are unable to use traditional banking services such as checks due to this policy, meaning almost all transactions from individual purchases to deposits on land are paid exclusively in cash.
Even beyond pecuniary benefit, the history of federal policies over marijuana has been riddled with racial and class discrimination. While both white and black Americans smoke marijuana at the same rates, black Americans are arrested 3.73 times more than white Americans. The history of incarceration has more than quadrupled the federal incarceration rate since 1980, serving nobody but corporate leaders directly profiting from an explosion of inmates. “Reasonable doubt” police practices have justified unreasonable searches and police attention toward black and Latino communities unjustifiably beyond normal practice.
The continued support for marijuana criminalization fails to provide real solutions and draws back to ’70s-era “war on drugs” rhetoric. Scholars have proven that overcrowded prison systems run by for-profit companies often fail to provide the “treatment” politicians cite, nor do they create sustainable attitudes toward crime. Rather, they put primarily black and brown humans out of public sight, where obnoxiously long sentences impair their ability to perform socially when released. Even now, American prison populations are about six to nine times as large as Western European nations. Recent statewide legalization policies have not correlated with the higher violence and “moral debasement” that others have alleged. Regardless, 40 years of a failed “war on drugs” policy which punished underprivileged communities while failing to adequately police other ones highlights the need for a different direction in an American approach to drugs.
Over the past decade, support for legalization has slowly gained traction, especially in California, Colorado and Washington — the latter two states having already legalized. It seems reasonable to demand federal legal action to conform to the direction of existing state policies, resolving contradictory attitudes in policy. Even now, the DEA continues to raid legal dispensaries as a federal authority. This ludicrous behavior of enforcement highlights a need to respond to harm done in local communities.
It is important, nevertheless, to recognize that legalizing marijuana won’t solve the problem. Legalization won’t stop the alarming patterns of violence police departments tend to inflict on communities of color. Legalization won’t prevent a corporate flood, as drug money shifts toward richer communities with the capital to invest in commercial infrastructure for marijuana. Legalization won’t resolve 40-year-old drug war attitudes that have created a private prison system that thrown countless lives into states of neglect. It will, however, fix one patch in American policy on a long, indeterminate road toward smarter drug policies.

“So, what are you?” Typically, this question is posed to people whose racial identity does not fall under European origin. However innocent in nature or well-intended, such an inquiry adds insult to injury. Not only are people of color “othered” by their non-whiteness alone, but they also are obliged to explain themselves and to reduce something as complex and personal as a racial identity into a homogenizing, non-specific and almost colorblind category. The same narrative holds true on college campuses; while USC does have a diverse and multifaceted cohort of minority students, the University fails to recognize certain racial groups and relegates the racial identities of students by using umbrella terms.
On the topic of diversity issues, Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences stated on its website: “We support the full inclusion of all of our undergraduate student populations and develop programs aimed at ensuring that each student takes full advantage of opportunities to be successful at USC and beyond. We have created specific programs to target our first-generation college population and strategies to support our underrepresented minority students in USC Dornsife.” In the name of diversity and representation, however, the student demographics for Fall 2015 suggest otherwise. As a result, the image of the University is one of inequity and misrepresentation that seeks to erase and condense diversity into neat, throw-away categories that are not reflective of the student population.
The student demographics for Fall 2015 includes Asians (17.9 percent), Black/African-American (5.4 percent), Hispanic (12.5 percent), White/Caucasian (33.7 percent), International (23.8 percent) and Other (6.7 percent). It is important to note that segregating and homogenizing racial demography is an act of structural discrimination that devalues students who do not have a category to identify with. Namely, Native American and Middle Eastern students are two important groups forced to identify inaccurately as white or other. University demographers need to understand that racial identity is incredibly personal.
Evidently, the misrepresentation of certain groups gives way to a campus climate that does not support inclusion and diversity. If marginalized students are intentionally unrecognized, it is impossible for them to feel included or supported by the institution. As a Middle Eastern student here at USC, I find that students who look like me are often not mentioned in diversity issues, campus climate meetings or petitions for cultural centers.
While I, too, feel exhausted from a campus climate that is discriminatory and hostile, I, along with other students, am completely left out of the conversation of undergraduate diversity in both administrative and student spaces. Because the University does not recognize students of Middle Eastern descent as part of its student demography, it inadvertently allows for a campus climate that is hostile. Quite frankly, if I am not white enough to walk through an airport without being accosted, I am not racially ambiguous enough to be labeled as “Other.” Middle Eastern culture, languages and phenotypic features are distinct enough to be celebrated — not ignored.
Matters of racial identity are of utmost importance when discussing inclusion and diversity issues. In order to facilitate an environment in which more than four races are recognized, the University should highly consider allowing students to self-identify so that the undergraduate demography is truly reflective of the students it is supposed to represent.

In anonymous interviews last week, Los Angeles Police Department Metro Division insiders stated that the LAPD is not ready to respond to “terrorist-style attack[s]” because of a lack of training and proper equipment. An interviewee told NBC Los Angeles “maybe 10 percent” of the officers in the Metro Division, which handles crime suppression and counterterrorism, were ready to handle an attack. LAPD’s readiness was all “smoke and mirrors.”
The story perpetuates the myth that the most effective response to terrorism is overwhelming police force. NBC has perpetuated a misunderstanding about terrorism that prevents citizens, and the governments that serve them, from effectively confronting the problem.
Terrorism is a tactic. Individuals and groups that are unhappy with governance structures and unable to seek political redress through legitimate channels use terrorism as a last resort to achieve their goals. Because of the power imbalance between the city of L.A., the state of California and the federal government, groups committing terror attacks do not seek direct confrontation with government forces. Attacks are designed to be carried out by few individuals, produce visible destruction and sow fear among Angelenos.
Put another way, a terror attack in L.A. won’t be Hans Gruber holding Nakatomi Plaza hostage, like in Die Hard. That’s too much of a direct confrontation. More likely are coordinated bombings, including small-scale attacks that capture media headlines, like the world has seen in much of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Terrorists attempt to instill fear to force policy change, not to kill as many people as possible.
Because the goal of terrorists is not to directly fight government forces, a trained Metro Division cannot effectively stop terrorist violence. As Brian Michael Jenkins, an expert on terrorism and senior advisor to the president of the RAND Corporation told the Los Angeles Times in November, the majority of deaths in a terror event happen before the police can respond. Response, no matter how good, is not enough to seriously mitigate or stop a terrorist attack.
Instead, the best option for Los Angeles is to address grievances before they become plots and, barring that, for the LAPD to gather intelligence to stop plots before they are executed. Smartly, L.A. already does this: The LAPD Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau specifically meets with community leaders to hear and address constituent concerns. That kind of government response to localized or individual challenges in Los Angeles protects all of L.A. by eliminating political motivations for violence.
Nationally, the United States has begun to undertake these community-led softer approaches to stopping terrorist attacks. In a L.A. Times op-ed last year, President Barack Obama focused on community, noting that “community leaders from Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Boston [highlighted] innovative partnerships in their cities … helping empower communities to protect their loved ones from extremist ideologies.” These partnerships were part of a pilot program that the President had tasked the Department of Homeland Security with running to explore locally led efforts to confront extremism.
True, L.A. and the United States could be doing better to engage communities to stop terrorist violence. The L.A. branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations noted soon after Obama’s op-ed appeared in the papers that the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California and the Muslim Student Association of the West Coast both opposed the narrow scope of current counterterror operations, which target and stereotype Muslim Americans. Terror is not limited to Muslims, as the recent attacks in Oregon demonstrate. In Los Angeles, stopping terrorism will require addressing political grievances in every community and group.

Courtney Tarleton, who notched three ground balls and forced a crucial turnover in women’s lacrosse’s 11-5 upset over No. 5 Duke Saturday, has earned MPSF Defensive Player of the Week honors.
This marks the second career defensive weekly award for Tarleton and the 14th certificate for the USC program.
 “She’s been the anchor of our defensive unit for a long time now and I think the defense as a whole played really really well on Saturday,” head coach Lindsey Munday said on Tarleton. “It was really a team effort and all eight people including the goalie really stepped up. Courtney did a phenomenal job coming up with those ground balls and being a vocal and physical leader on the field on Saturday and we need her to continue to do that throughout the season.” 
Continuing to build upon the momentum they created in their commanding 21-2 victory against Stetson, the Trojans demonstrated discipline and grit, holding the Blue Devils to just 11 shots and 14 forced turnovers. Tarleton remained an instrumental component of the Trojan defense, leaving Duke scoreless for a crucial period of 25 minutes in which the Trojans maintained a strong 9-3 lead.
In their best season in just four short years as a program, the Trojans’ second win against Duke marks the first time in program history that the team beat a top-10 team and just the third victory against a ranked team in school history. For the Trojans, this win was especially sweet as the team’s 2015 season ended at the hands of Duke in a 17-9 loss in the second round of the NCAA Championships.
“We definitely thought back to last year,” Tarleton said. “They scored 17 goals against us so going into it we knew we had to hold them to a much smaller number if we wanted to even come close to winning. But we just wanted to stay together the whole entire game and when things got tough, to come together and make sure we fix it for the next play.” 
With a 2-0 record heading into the remainder of the season, the Trojans look to maintain a strong defensive unit that has allowed just seven goals between their two games. Offensively, the Women of Troy’s execution of shots and cohesion has led them to record a combined 32 goals between their two contests against Stetson and Duke. With Michaela Micheal earning MPSF Offensive Player of the Week last week, and junior attacker Kylie Drexel recording four goals against Duke, the Trojans have depth on both sides of the field and hope to continue to build upon the success they have created in their initial games.  
“We just want to keep getting better,” Tarleton said. “We’re really lucky to have these two weeks off from games because it’s really a time to just come together and battle in practice and we know that we can’t be satisfied with just beating a top team now, we have to keep getting better throughout the season.” 
In an upcoming bye week, the Trojans will prepare for a home stretch with two contests slated for March 4 against Michigan and Vermont on March 6.
