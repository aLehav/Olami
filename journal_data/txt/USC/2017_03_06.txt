When Alec Goldberg, a senior majoring in art, noticed the dearth in high-quality menswear subscription services, he decided to start one himself. Three Arrows, a premium menswear line that combines activewear, social wear and career wear was born.
Three Arrows has already been featured in outlets such as Yahoo Finance, Huffington Post and Haywire, and is well on its way to making a mark on the subscription business. Additionally, all clothing is manufactured entirely in the United States.
“I’ve always really been into fashion,” Goldberg said. “When I came out here, I got to work at [a top men’s clothing subscription company]. I realized that there’s a huge gap in menswear where there’s a lot of people who want subscriptions, but they don’t seem to offer high quality.”
Goldberg said that his experiences working in the fashion industry inspired him to build his own brand.
“Seeing all these different issues made me want to combine everything I love about the clothing industry while fixing all the things we have issues with,” Goldberg said.
In seeking to distinguish his clothing line from others, Goldberg ensured that his clothes were made with the highest quality materials and modeled his startup after other successful companies-turned-lifestyle brands, such as Lululemon.
He also decided to allow customers to pick and choose what to receive in the subscription kits, allowing the process to be more personal and interactive. 
“What really distinguishes us is our quality,” Goldberg said. “We’re the only subscription line that allows you to curate kits yourself or have one of us, a personal stylist, curate for you.”
Considering the startup is still in its fledgling stages, Goldberg has encountered difficulties in directing his marketing towards a larger audience and generating interest in his product, as well as establishing rapport with manufacturers without a solid foundation backing him up. 
“It’s very difficult to get people to understand the quality of your product without substantial brand recognition and getting your product out there so people can feel it.,” Goldberg said. “I’m figuring out how to get the audience I’m looking for. Long term, I’ve struggled with developing good relationships with manufacturers that you can trust, when you’re still a very small player in the game.” 
Despite his difficulties, however, Goldberg experienced an enormous sense of accomplishment when a couple articles of clothing were produced, and he was able to witness his designs come to life. 
“A high point was definitely the first time I actually got to wear my clothes to school or to the gym that I had been designing, manufacturing for over a year and actually getting to see that come to fruition,” Goldberg said. 
Goldberg has high hopes for the future of Three Arrows if successful, he wants to expand into women’s clothing and set up several brick-and-mortar stores. 
“Ideally, by 2019, we’ll have a women’s line, and we’ll be able to be one of the first subscription lines to actually have retail locations as well,” Goldberg said. “After the kickstarter, we’re definitely planning on approaching investors and getting some more people onboard.” 
While most students are studying at USC to prepare for an already-established career path in a certain field, Goldberg has already taken steps towards launching an entirely self-directed, self-made career. 
“Realistically, I see this as my future career,” Goldberg said. “I realized last summer I can never work for someone again — too many suggestions that weren’t listened to, and I just didn’t like that.”
Goldberg hopes that Three Arrows will grow into a lifetime career. 
“It’s interesting because I feel like I go to school for my career, and yet here I am in the midst of my career and I’m struggling with school,” Goldberg said. “I see myself working at Three Arrows for the rest of my life.” 
Austin Murphy, a junior majoring in art and design, was one of the few to receive an advance sample of Three Arrows merchandise. 
“I currently have his pants,” Murphy said. “They’re stylish, they fit my body well, and allow me to be active while looking good, it’s all about the craftsmanship and the material.”
Murphy, who looks for high quality and reasonable prices in his apparel, firmly believed that the Three Arrows garments fit the bill. 
“It’s a good bargain. Usually I’m a guy who finds good deals, and this one I thought was well worth it,” Murphy said. “All the clothing is done is small batches right now so it’s made to last.”

“Sex is the only thing we call ‘making love,’ yet to students in college participating in hookup culture, sex is the most meaningless act — even more meaningless than the act of holding hands,” Lisa Wade, an associate professor of sociology at Occidental College, said on Monday night during a talk about her upcoming book American Hookup: the New Culture of Sex on Campus at the USC Rossier School of Education.
“There’s a contradiction when it comes to sexual activity on college campuses: Most students are not having as much sex as they would like, but also they are choosing not to have casual sex because they don’t like the way it is happening,” Wade said. “So I wanted to find out, how is it that this thing that students aren’t doing is making them so unhappy?”
Wade began her talk by defining “hooking up,” and contrasted the act of hooking up from the culture of hookups. Wade described hookups as sexual encounters without the intent of it advancing onto anything romantic. 
Wade explained the naturality associated with hookups and that it “should not be looked down upon.” However, she said that hookup culture is different.
“A campus has a hookup culture when hooking up is seen as the only or best way to be sexual with each other,” Wade said. “Other ways of being sexual with one another are seen as somehow backward or strange. So hookup culture is this dominant idea that hooking up is what students should be doing.”
Within hookup culture, Wade’s research found certain trends college students followed in terms of their perceptions of themselves and of their peers. According to Wade, while being seen as a slut or a prude used to be the worst possible sexual demotion, modern hookup culture tended to see desperation as even worse than the former two. 
“In this hookup culture, the most important emotion to avoid is love,” Wade said. “You don’t want to seem desperate because that makes you seem clingy and it implies a desire for someone that is not purely sexual.”
Wade continued on to describe what she called the “emotion rules” of hookup culture — rules that students followed in order to guarantee both parties’ mutual agreement and understanding that the sexual activities were casual. 
Within these rules, Wade listed that students opted to have casual sex with people they were definitely repulsed by, that they hooked up when drunk, that during sex students expressed lust but not tenderness or affection and that after hooking up, students tended to distance themselves from their partners in order to assert the meaninglessness of the sexual encounter. 
“Most people aren’t not hooking up because they are religiously opposed to it, or that they think it’s hopeless to try,” Wade said. “A lot of people aren’t comfortable with the idea of bottling up their emotions and having to hide their emotions in such an intimate activity. And functionally, it’s a downward spiral because you don’t just have to not care, you have to care less than the other person. And so everyone’s being meaner and meaner to each other, hurting each other in the long run.”

In the United States, economists believe that over time, the gender wage gap has declined, although it has not gone away completely. According to Efrén Pérez, these gender inequalities persist because of patriarchal attitudes and beliefs that promote and reinforce women’s unequal status in society.
Pérez, an associate professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, discussed the effect of gendered languages toward gender equality at the Department of Political Science’s event Monday at the Von KleinSmid Center. Pérez talked about various studies that show the effects of language perspective on gender equality. 
Pérez is the co-director of the Department of Political Science’s Research on Individuals, Politics, & Society at Vanderbilt University. His research includes studies on political psychology, public opinion and racial and ethnic politics. He has published several papers on the relationship between language and survey response, group identity, identity threat and political response. He is also the author of Unspoken Politics: Implicit Attitudes and Political Thinking.
The focus and motivation of Pérez’s research were the persistent levels of gender disparity seen across the world. Pérez said that development should reduce and possibly eliminate these gender imbalances, which was not the case every time.
“We know that in many areas of the world gender inequalities continue in spite of greater socioeconomic development,” Pérez said.
Pérez added that these attitudes exist even in highly developed countries.
“These gender disparities die hard, and this is especially so in the case of politics where women continue to be underplaced in positions of high prestige and power,” Pérez said. “These asymmetrical attitudes served to negatively impact the social, the economic and the political outcomes of females in many societies.”
Pérez said that this type of thinking can come from the language that a person speaks. Gendered language may affect speakers’ perceptions of men and women, according to Pérez.
“Speaking a genderless tongue should help to promote greater perceived equity between men and women,” Pérez said. “Speakers of a genderless tongue are less sensitive to these male-female distinctions.”
Pérez talked about various studies that showed the effect of different languages on perceptions of time and space. Pérez said that the differences can map on to performance on non-cognitive or nonverbal tasks.
“Language can affect our thinking spontaneously, without our active direction and many times under our full level of awareness,” Pérez said. “These language effects do not require articulation or verbalization.”
Pérez said that political thinking is a peculiar mode of cognition, and most people tend to construct opinions on the spot.
“For a speaker of a gendered language like Spanish, gender as a consideration should be relatively more strongly activated,” Pérez said. “For a speaker of a genderless language, gender as a consideration is going to be less strongly activated.”
Naveen Katam, a graduate student studying electrical engineering, said he was surprised to learn that language can have an effect on what we think about gender equality.
“Even the concept of thinking that [languages] can affect is the first thing that I have learned,” Katam said. “I always thought people have one opinion, no matter what language they speak. It’s something which is so complex … how it affects and spans the range of your own values and perceptions.”
Pérez also talked about various studies that looked at whether language plays an important role in public attitudes toward gender equality. The results showed that people who spoke a genderless language were more supportive of a female nominee for defense minister and were more likely to agree with increase in female political recruitment. 
These studies also showed that people who spoke genderless languages at home were more inclined toward gender equality.
“I think what we have is a converging evidence that a language one speaks can affect what one thinks about gender equality,” Pérez said. “Social pressure more generally might actually serve as the possible moderator of the types of language effects that we recorded.”

With spring break looming, many Trojans will decide whether to spend the vacation abroad, at home or on campus. For some students, this decision is financially motivated. Many low-income students are unable to afford traveling home over spring break, and in order to support students of all socioeconomic statuses, the school must at the very least make food available to students who lack the privilege to leave campus for spring break. With the dining halls shut down for the entire week of spring break, USC is blatantly ignoring those who do not have a choice. Additionally, freshmen from low-income backgrounds, who by this, as they lack experience living without a meal plan, will be most affected.
USC is notorious for its high tuition costs. While the University has attempted to combat these fees with scholarships and financial aid, the fact remains that USC is very expensive to attend. In a sustained effort to increase social and economic diversity, however, USC has made substantial steps toward making college more affordable for low-income and low-opportunity students. 
Twenty-one  percent of students receive merit-based scholarships from the University, and more than two-thirds of students receive financial aid. A study from The New York Times favorably ranked USC among other elite schools for accepting students from all economic backgrounds, and the average household income for an admitted student at USC is lower than at comparable schools. Regarding cultural and social diversity, 24.1 percent of students are international, a fact USC is proud of. These on-paper statistics all show an upward trajectory for the goals that the University is attempting to accomplish. 
However, the truth remains that for day-to-day student life, Trojans are not receiving the proper support for the amount of money students pay — and the fact that dining halls will not be available over break underscores this. 
Throughout the week of spring break, without access to the dining halls students pay for in required meal plans, students who cannot afford to travel and leave campus will have to buy their own food from local grocery shops and restaurants. The economic burden of providing one’s own meals despite having already paid for a meal plan may be insignificant to some students who choose to stay on campus over break, but will dramatically and disproportionately affect those who lack the economic means to travel or are already food-insecure.
Many of the previously mentioned scholarships simply lower tuition, but do not address students’ needs in terms of books, food, housing and leisure expenses. Freshmen are required to purchase a $5,700-plus dining plan that ultimately fails to cover nine days spent on campus during the spring semester. Although students have access to dorm rooms and USC-owned apartments throughout the break, food costs within the area are not insignificant, and this economic burden is a lot to shoulder, especially for freshmen who are less likely to be employed, and probably have less money saved than upperclassmen. 
The majority of housing units on campus do not have kitchens, so cooking food is nearly impossible. The only other option as a freshman on campus is to purchase non-perishable, easy-to-prepare food from a nearby grocery store or eat out two to three meals per day for nine full days. This forces students who can already barely afford to attend the University to spend more money and eat unhealthy diets. At a school with the 10th highest tuition in the world, in a city where the cost of living is one of the highest in the United States, food should be the bare minimum of what is granted to all students. 
Instead, tuition keeps increasing, leaving students in the dark for what exactly their money pays for. At the very least, the press release regarding a 3.93 percent increase in tuition should have addressed some of the daily problems that lower-income students face. The University is on track to meet its $6 billion fundraising goal, and was under-budget in construction of USC Village. If the University lowered the cost of food, bookstore textbooks or even housing, which it is more than financially capable to do, then the school would be more accessible to lower-income students.
This article is full of unrealistic fantasy. This author wishes the books were cheaper. food were cheaper, housing were cheaper, and, most importantly tuition were cheaper. you think everything you can get access to should be cheaper and the university should pay for all of these for you. If some students can’t afford some of the money, hey, USC should pay for it. And, USC has to accept more poor students. Wow, the logic! I am very disappointed at this pointless article.
And if the author is a low-income student herself? Individuals shouldn’t have to fill in because institutions don’t yet have viable solutions to fix the problems they create.
There are plenty of low cost meal options in the surrounding neighborhood.  Or perhaps bring one or two students home with you for the week.  Practice what you preach.  You’ll learn far more from doing that than just writing an op ed piece.
Very nice sentiments. Why don’t you invite some poor kids to spend Spring Break at your home? You already did? Good.  You are a kind person! 
Respectfully, people like you only enable oppression.  Your response is unfortunately the same generic response that could literally be applied to any argument in the history of arguments – you must realize how terribly uncreative you sound?  
By your logic, anytime a first party oppresses a second party, a third party MUST be silent unless the third party successfully remedies the oppression of the second party.  In other words, you prefer to allow the first party to continue to oppress.  Literally makes no sense :/
I’d also like to point out the journalist may very well have done exactly what you proposed – could you provide evidence he/she did not?  Thanks!

John Howard, a 19-year-old Idaho student who sexually assaulted his high school football teammate in October 2015, was sentenced to 300 hours of community service with probation on Feb. 24. Howard’s black and mentally disabled teammate testified that his teammates helped Howard forcibly rape him using a hanger.
The case, which has drawn uproar for its numerous implications — sexual assault, racially targeted abuse, ableism and Howard’s privilege as a member of a notable family in the town of Dietrich, where the assault occurred — is now under even more fire. District judge Randy Stoker said that slurs that the slurs used against the victim, such as “fried chicken” and “watermelon,” were not racial in nature, and that the attack “was not sexual.”
This sentence demonstrates a deliberate blindness to racism that a number of racial minorities in this country already know to exist. It is not relevant whether Stoker knew the harmful racial stereotypes implied by the terms he used. The point is that he should have; acknowledgement of the racially motivated nature of the abuse would have had a profound impact on Howard’s sentence. In the judge’s own words: “If I thought that you had committed this offense for racial purposes, you would go straight to the Idaho penitentiary.” 
Yet even this hypothetical promise doesn’t seem likely. One of the proposed sentences for Howard had included racial sensitivity training along with community service hours — but still no jail time. 
This blindness to racism not only reflects an unwillingness to acknowledge the buildup of trauma for the victim, who was consistently subjected to racism even before the attack, but also cushions the blow for Howard, who is white. His drastically light sentencing has been compared to that of convicted rapist Brock Turner, who served only three months out of his six month jail sentence for sexually assaulting a woman. Critics of the Turner case have pointed out that Turner’s status as a wealthy white male from an elite university allowed him to wield influence to get out of serving the punishment he should have faced. Similarly, in the case of Howard, ignoring the fact that he is white would be to our peril.
The privilege of a white perpetrator is even reflected in Stoker’s assertion that there was nothing sexual about the crime, and that Howard should not be treated as a sex offender. If a judge cannot see rape as a crime of sexual assault that requires due punishment, it is more than reasonable to examine a racial pattern among white assailants, such as Turner, who receive lighter sentences for sexual assault.
What makes this cover-up of a racially motivated sexual assault even more sinister is the way in which it has been systematically carried out, from the halls of Dietrich High School to the courtroom. The racial slurs directed at the victim by his teammates were not condemned by his coaches, but rather made even worse: In court, the victim recounted that head football coach Mike Torgerson allegedly “offered him grape soda if he made a good play in a game.” Yet not one of the acts of racism towards the victim were enough for Stoker to see the assault as racially motivated — or even as sexual assault at all — exemplifying a top-down blindness to racism.
There is one part of the case that has come under suspicion and has unfortunately given leeway to those eager to dismiss racial motivations. In a recorded conversation last May with Torgerson and another football coach, along with several of the victim’s friends and teammates, the victim is heard saying that he was “fed lies” by his parents and pressured to lie when he testified in court because his parents sought the money from a $10 million civil lawsuit. 
He is even heard saying that he “[loves] those guys” in reference to the perpetrators, and that they “shouldn’t be charged.” He retracted these statements in February, saying that he “told them what they wanted to hear because he wanted his friends back.” Regardless of whether we can find truth in this confusion, there is one key fact that remains the same: The victim, against all attempts by his perpetrators to dismiss it, was attacked at least in part on the basis of his race. Even the judge did not dispute that terms such as “fried chicken” were used against the victim.
Events in this case and its final outcome serve as an underhanded effort to hide racism as thoroughly as possible, obscuring an already deeply suppressed reality that racial minorities have no choice but to face. This singular situation does not even begin to highlight the erasure of sexual assault by the judge. The victim’s life has been altered for the worse — he attempted suicide last June. While hospitalized he wrote a poem, and it reveals perhaps the strongest indictment of the blindness to racism: “It liks [sic] to pound you to the ground, and lock the door for your opportunities, and leave you helpless, without a sound.”

Friday night saw an onslaught of raw talent and a kaleidoscope of heartfelt stories about identity, love and passion at Ground Zero Performance Café.
As part of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly organized its own student-based talent show, APASA’s Got Talent. The event featured a wide array of performances from singing to spoken word and free milkshakes for the first 35 audience members. 
Aseem Afsah, APASA’s advocacy chair, elaborated upon his hopes for the event. 
“We’ve the privilege of being the voice of Asian American students,” Afsah said. “Given the social and political climate and conversation about race in the U.S., we have to use that responsibility wisely to continue to advocate for this platform for conversation.”
A spin-off of the popular reality television Got Talent franchise, the popular annual talent show showcased the artistic abilities of USC’s Asian American student community. The night was filled with electrifying performances from eight contestants, each followed by feedback from Fuzzzy, Priska and David Choi.
One of the performers of the night was Melody Lee, who performed a classical rendition of Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” with a hip-hop twist. Other hidden gems also included Alex Luu, the founder of poetry club Slam SCene, and Izzy Brown, a member of SoCal VoCals. While Luu performed a passionate poem about a bowl of phở to express his Vietnamese identity, Brown chose to sing a cover of Rihanna’s “Love on the Brain.” 
Senior Leo Xia’s performance of his original song “Flame” raised eyebrows and received loud applauses from audience members. Xia successfully used his personal experiences of understanding his identity to resonate with the audience. 
The singer-songwriter, who recently released his EP album Hyphenated, also spoke about how his songwriting journey began with writing love songs in middle school and blossomed in high school and college when he started learning more about his Asian American identity. 
The final contestant winners were revealed at the end of the night. Izzy Brown and Alex Luu were the second and first runner-ups, respectively. The night ended with the announcement of the contest’s winner, Matt Zurik, who carried out a praise-worthy performance with enticing vocals. 
Apart from the contestants’ performances, the guest judges’ performances also proved memorable. Most notably, David Choi’s mellifluous performance of “Missing Piece” touched hearts when he invited a couple to slow dance on stage as he dedicated his song to the audience.
Regarding his thoughts on the event, Choi commented on the event as being the perfect platform to showcase and discover.
“Our lives are defined by the stories that we tell,” Choi said. He also noted the importance of telling stories from an honest place.  
A night that buzzed until the very last song, APASA’s Got Talent presented different voices and stories that gave life to USC’s Asian American community and created a creative medium for students to express themselves.

Most art museums come with a caveat: You can look, but you can’t touch. This is certainly not the case at Sound Maze, an interactive exhibit currently housed at the USC Fisher Museum of Art.
Sound Maze features unique instruments designed and built by Paul Dresher, a composer, performer and artist. Since his high school days, Dresher has been interested in finding ways to push the boundaries of sound, and he realized that inventing new instruments provided the perfect blend of imagination and hands-on experience. 
“I’ve always been curious about either new ways to make old sounds or new ways to make new sounds,” Dresher said. “I also enjoy working with my hands. It’s satisfying for me to improvise in the shop when I’m building. I try things out — I discover the materials that will make interesting sounds.” 
Though he has played his instruments in concert settings before, Dresher had never displayed them in a museum. In collaboration with USC Visions and Voices, Dresher installed them at the Fisher Museum, providing his instruments with a new dimension as artistic objects, not just as musical objects. 
“This is a very unique opportunity for me. I’m a performing artist primarily — I do my work in concert halls and theaters,” Dresher said. “Here was the very first time we’ve presented these instruments in a museum context. Maybe the audience will come to it with a different expectation, looking at it more like art than as a musical instrument.” 
Dresher hoped that his work would re-instill a sense of wonder and exploration into the world of music, which he views as all too often lacking an element of joy or vivacity. 
“We don’t say ‘work at music,’ we say ‘play music,’” Dresher said. “Music should have a sense of play. And that’s one of the things that invented musical instruments can do. It’s hard work, but the sense of fun and play should never be lost.”
Selma Holo, the director of Fisher Museum and a professor of art history, agreed with Dresher’s sentiments. The museum-goers, many of whom were young children, took full advantage of the rare opportunity to interact with the exhibit and find their own sounds. The space was filled with a cacophony of discordant notes as they delighted in experimenting with the exotic-looking instruments. 
“It’s so original, so crazy, so interactive and so much fun,” Holo said. “It’s very thrilling to see everybody playing around. Museums should be playgrounds.”
Holo also admired the way Dresher’s work existed in the middle ground between musical instruments and sound sculptures, straddling a line that often became blurred. 
“It helps us break down boundaries in our thinking,” Holo said. “In life, there are a lot of fine lines between things but we’re used to defining them very strictly, so I think it’s important for students and faculty to be able to say this partakes in different characteristics.”
For Mya Worrell, an undecided freshman, the instrument installations, with their roughly-hewn wood, unprotected wiring and mechanical innards exposed to the world, appeared rugged but sturdy. 
“There’s a very do-it-yourself aspect to them,” Worrell said. “They’re made of wood. You can see their construction and how they were put together.” 
Worrell, who is currently taking a class on sound studies, marveled at the connection between sound and physical entities, how one could emanate from the other and how sound itself could be perceived to take up space. 
“Thinking of sound as not just something that you hear but as a three dimensional force that happens through space and time and objects really informs the way I look at sound right now,” Worrell said. “It’s definitely not something you think about, of sound as a physical presence that is in most of our day-to-day lives.”

Sunday brunch. It’s the perfect culmination to a long week, serving as a time to both celebrate and drown sorrows in an abundance of food. Breaking away from the classic eggs, waffles and bottomless mimosas, innovative Indian gastropub Badmaash launched its new brunch menu last weekend, packed with interesting and original dishes.
Badmaash opened in 2013 with the goal to put a modern spin on Indian food. Its lunch and dinner menus reflect this, with all kinds of inventive items from butter chicken samosas to masala fries.
This contemporary style permeates not only in the branding, but also throughout the decor and menu of the restaurant. One of the walls is covered from floor to ceiling in an array of colorful stripes. Old Bollywood movies are projected on the wall for visitors to enjoy as they read from menus covered in cute illustrations and funny comics.
Though Badmaash started off as a hidden gem, it’s been rising in popularity within Los Angeles’ culinary scene. The past few weeks have seen celebrities such as rock band Linkin Park and singer Zayn Malik enjoying the delicacies that the restaurant has to offer. This increasing fame may partially be a reason for its menu expansion and new brunch offerings.
Similar to the original menu, the new brunch menu also consists of unique options to choose from. While the quality of options is certainly excellent, the quantity is rather small. There are only several options to pick from, such as bacon biryani, railway masala omelet, pork belly hash and punjabi channa bathura.
Visitors can sustain themselves while waiting for their food by sipping on Badmaash’s popular, mouth-watering Bombay cutting chai, a chai tea made with water, milk, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and pepper. The beverage is served in little glass cups carried in green caddies, resembling the chai-wallas, or tea sellers, that are prominent throughout India.
The actual food dishes come arranged quite beautifully on a plate, alongside a vibrant purple flower that intensifies the aesthetic. The food is pleasing not only to the eye, but also to the taste buds. With a perfect balance of cheddar, serrano, onions and cilantro, the Bombay grilled cheese melts in one’s mouth. The same could be said for the railway masala omelet that transforms an average omelet into completely new dish complete with the vegetables, turmeric and chiles.
Making sure to still incorporate some classics of brunch, the menu has items like mango mimosas and pork belly hash. However, usual brunch-goers are still certain to have never tried anything like it.
While Badmaash is a restaurant filled with great food, friendly staff and contemporary vibes, no eating establishment is perfect. The prices, for one, do fall on the more expensive end of the spectrum. Also, another downfall of Badmaash is the restaurant’s size. While there are two floors, both areas are quite compact and unable to hold a large capacity. It’s easy to see how it could get packed, quickly going from cozy to claustrophobic.
Overall, Badmaash definitely pleased as both a restaurant as a whole and as a new brunch spot. It is fresh and fun and leaves your stomach — and viewers of your Snapchat story — extremely satisfied.

Midterms have this funny way of commandeering every aspect of your life: your sleep schedule, your stress levels and your conversations with friends. This semester, my internship also had the comedic timing to get into full swing last week, so basically I made it to Friday barely functioning.
It was the first time all year that I hadn’t run at all during the week. Not once did I manage to spare 20 minutes for my two-mile jog around the campus perimeter. Not once did I make it through the doors of the Lyon Center, much less get lucky enough to score a working treadmill. It was that kind of week.
I was a little disappointed in myself because I like to believe that running has become such an integral part of my lifestyle that I could never just blatantly skip out on it. That would be like skipping dinner or brushing my teeth. Midterms, man.
So I went to bed early Friday knowing I had to make up for it. I took back all the negative thoughts I had ever had about the so-called weekend warriors, the people who squeeze the weekly recommended dose of exercise into the only two days that start with “S.” And I committed to becoming one myself just for a weekend.
My friend Jenny and I did our long run on Saturday to start the weekend off right. Jenny mapped out an 8-mile route that took us from campus to the Broad Museum and the Walt Disney Concert Hall downtown. For the first few miles, it barely felt like I had skipped a beat — I mean, a week.
Then there was something we don’t see much during our runs — a massive hill. The hill going toward the Broad is steep and long, and even the crosswalk in the middle doesn’t give you enough of the breather. Jenny and I talked about it for a long time before we actually got there, debating whether we should walk it.
But of course, neither of us had run much this week, so we didn’t deserve to walk it. We leaned forward and put our glutes into it. My legs burned in no time, and by the time I crossed the crosswalk, I could no longer pretend I had any control over my labored breathing. When I finally reached the height of the highway overpass and the incline leveled off, I couldn’t have kept running even if I tried. Jenny and I stopped at a cafe up there to get a cup of water and headed home.
By the time we got back, it was 9:30 a.m. and campus had started to show signs of life. Some students were out walking dogs or heading home in last night’s clothes. The drive-through at Starbucks was already spilling out onto Figueroa. 
As awful as we had felt going up that hill, Jenny and I both agreed that it was a good run overall. And now, we had the whole weekend ahead of us. We celebrated with an Instagrammable brunch.
I have to give it to the weekend warriors, actually. There is something really fun and rewarding about taking the time on the weekend to get to know your favorite sport. It felt more like the pursuit of a passion instead of a weekday chore.
 Usually, my runs during the week are on a time crunch because I squeeze them in between classes and homework and my internship. While they get the job done, there’s a difference between making running a part of your life and making it a part of your life that you enjoy. And who doesn’t look forward to the weekend?
I’m going to try to get back on track this week, despite one looming midterm project. Even though the weekend warrior life is an enjoyable one, I still like having the health benefits of running all week long. And maybe this week, every run will make every day feel a little more like Saturday.

Following last week’s road trip to North Carolina for games against Wake Forest and Duke, the USC baseball team returned to Los Angeles last weekend for the Dodgertown Baseball Classic. After losing games to San Diego and Michigan at home, USC finished the weekend with a big win over UCLA at Dodger Stadium. 
“I told the kids after the [Michigan] game, it’s our first opportunity of what I hope is not very many — when you’re down 0-2 and have to come and salvage the weekend,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We got down early, and to the kids’ credit, they came [back] and stuck with it. I’m really proud of them for that because it’s easy when you’re inexperienced to wear it for the third day.” 
In their first game of the Classic back at Dedeaux Field, the Trojans faced off against the University of San Diego on Friday. The game was close early on, until a five-run fifth inning by the Toreros sealed the Trojans’ fate. San Diego won 8-3 despite recording one fewer hit than USC. 
The Trojans looked to rebound on Saturday against Michigan, once again at their home ballpark. However, they instead dropped their second game in a row. This time, USC encountered a cold night at the plate, only mustering three hits en route to a 4-1 loss.
In the concluding game of the weekend at Dodger Stadium, the Trojans squared off against crosstown rival UCLA. The Bruins jumped out to an early lead in the second inning thanks to a solo home run to left field from second baseman Chase Strumpf. UCLA then scored on an error in the third and again on a sacrifice fly in the fourth to extend its advantage to 3-0. 
For the first five innings, the Trojan lineup had no answer for UCLA’s sophomore right hander Jon Olsen. Beginning the bottom of the sixth, Olsen had struck out eight batters and given up just one hit: a first inning double by redshirt junior shortstop Frankie Rios. However, with two outs in the sixth, sophomore first baseman Lars Nootbaar trimmed the Bruins’ advantage to one with a wall-scraping triple that brought home two runs. After UCLA head coach John Savage replaced Olsen with Ryan Garcia, freshman outfielder Matthew Acosta drove Nootbaar home on a single to center. Suddenly, the Trojans had the game tied at 3-3. 
The Trojans and Bruins remained deadlocked through the next three innings, with neither team able to even get a runner in scoring position. UCLA went three-up, three-down in the bottom of the ninth to take the game into extra innings with the score still 3-3. 
With both teams exhausted after a long weekend and most of the crowd at Chavez Ravine already in the parking lot, USC was in search of a big play to finish the game. Nootbaar provided just that, blasting a double to right field that sent freshman designated hitter John Thomas around to score from first. The Trojans had a 4-3 lead to protect entering the bottom of the 10th inning. 
“I wasn’t really thinking much,” Nootbaar said. “I was praying to God that John Thomas could come around and score. I’m glad he did.” 
After Nootbaar’s go-ahead blast, it was up to sophomore reliever Solomon Bates to save the game. He did so successfully, notching a strikeout and two straight flyouts — the last out a foul ball caught fittingly by Nootbaar, which ended the game. 
Nootbaar might have taken home the game ball after the win, but freshman Chris Clarke was the Trojans’ unsung hero on Sunday, coming in to relieve sophomore starter Marrick Crouse in the fourth inning. Hurling 5.2 innings out of the bullpen, the 6-foot-7-inch Clarke gave up one hit and fanned five while giving up no runs, and thanks to USC’s 10th-inning rally, he earned his first career win. His brother Zander Clarke, a redshirt sophomore infielder for UCLA, came in to pinch hit in the 10th inning, just missing an encounter with his younger sibling on the mound. 
“[Coach Hubbs] came into the dugout a few times and asked how I was feeling,” Chris Clarke said. “Every time I said, ‘Fantastic,’ because all I wanted was the ball in my hand.”
The Trojans now sit at 7-4 on the season. This week, they look forward to a road tilt against San Diego State on Tuesday before they return to Dedeaux Field for a three-game series against Holy Cross that begins on Friday.

On a windy Saturday morning in Malibu, Calif., the nation got a glimpse of what the new-look beach volleyball team has in store for the 2017 campaign. The No. 1 Trojans (2-0) edged No. 4 UCLA 3-2 and beat No. 3 Pepperdine 4-1 to pick up a pair of big dual victories at the annual Pepperdine Kick-Off on the sands of Zuma Beach.
 Four new Trojan pairs made their debuts for head coach Anna Collier and each notched at least one win, showing promise to begin the season.
“I thought my pairs were quite solid this first weekend,” Collier said. “They had really good chemistry out on the court, and whenever they got in a little bit of trouble, which almost everybody did, they came together and worked through situations to improve on whatever they needed to improve on.”
To start USC’s dual against UCLA, all five courts were engaged in hotly contested first sets, but the Trojans got on the board with wins at courts one and three. Senior All-Americans Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes took down UCLA twins Megan and Nicole McNamara
(21-19, 21-12) at the top court, while the new pairing of senior Nicolette Martin and junior Terese Cannon posted a 21-16, 21-18 win over Savvy Simo and Torrey Van Winden at court three. The Bruins were able to snag a win at court four, as Izzy Carey and Elise Zappia defeated USC’s youngest pair of sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis, 21-19,
21-15. The final two courts went the distance, and a victory by juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer at court five over Chanti Holroyd and Lily Justine (21-18, 17-21, 15-11) sealed USC’s first dual win of the season.
Immediately after their battle with the Bruins, the Trojans turned around and faced off against Pepperdine. The Waves’ home court advantage did not mean much, though, as USC scored 3 points in straight sets to secure the dual win. Seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler, another one of Collier’s new pairs, got their first win of the season over Brittany Howard and Corinne Quiggle
(21-15, 21-18) at court two, while Claes and Hughes easily downed Delaney Knudsen and Madalyn Roh
(21-12, 21-13) to give USC its second point. That victory for Claes and Hughes ran their winning streak to 75 in a row.
The four-pair of Bustamante and Dennis bounced back from their early morning loss to notch their first win — a 21-13, 25-23 decision over Deahna Kraft and Anika Wilson — and clinch the dual for the Trojans. Courts three and five played to completion, as the Waves snagged their only point of the day behind Skylar Caputo and Heidi Dyer’s 22-20, 21-14 win over Cannon and Martin. Belton and Kremer once again went the distance on court five and triumphed for the second time with a 20-22, 21-16, 15-11 win over Gigi Hernandez and Katty Workman.
With the victory, USC improved its school-record winning streak to 32 matches in a row. Before Saturday, Pepperdine was the only program to hold a winning record against USC, but the Trojan win evened up the
all-time series record to 8-8. USC has now won four in a row against the Waves, while also remaining undefeated against UCLA at 6-0 all-time.
 Knowing that this weekend would serve as a good barometer of where her team stands to begin the season, Collier was pleased with how things turned out.
“We were challenged exactly the way I wanted to be challenged,” Collier said. “Pepperdine and UCLA were able to show some of our weaknesses that we haven’t been able to find or see in our practices, and now we know what we need to work on in order to improve.”
Hughes was also pleased with her team’s display of confidence and poise against top-ranked competition.
“We came out with that No. 1 ranking, and that’s not an easy one to have because that target on our back gets bigger and bigger,” she said. “But we came out and proved ourselves today. We played two of the toughest teams in the nation, and I’m happy we came out with those wins.”
The Trojans return to action on Saturday for the East Meets West Invitational in Manhattan Beach, Calif. USC will face off against Florida International at 10:30 a.m. in its first match of the day before taking on LSU at 12:30 p.m.

When children first learn how to walk, no one critiques or bashes them for being too slow. You’re just happy that the kids are walking. And once they nail the clumsy walk, everyone marvels at their ability to self-navigate, as unstable as children may be. But eventually, the children’s walk is expected to mature into a stable strut. 
Right now, the USC men’s basketball team is a child who needs to begin straightening up his stride. After making last year’s NCAA Tournament and finishing with a 21-13 record, we’ve seen that this baby can take its first steps, but it’s time for the Trojans to stabilize their walk as they are on the verge of a second consecutive appearance in March Madness. 
In other words, it’s no longer acceptable for the Trojans to continue just showing up to the Big Dance; it’s time for them to make some noise there. While the gut punch of a
first-round exit in last year’s tournament may have been acceptable, this season is the time for USC to establish itself as a respectable postseason threat. 
The Trojans (23-8, 10-8) are coming off a pair of solid victories against Washington State and Washington to round out their 2016-2017 regular season. And as nice as two wins — albeit against mediocre competition — may look, the game on Feb. 26 against Arizona State raises concerns about this USC team entering postseason play.
That game between the Trojans and the Sun Devils just over one week ago saw USC blow a 10-point lead over Arizona State with 3:57 remaining; it was USC’s eighth conference loss of the season. 
“We didn’t deserve to win that game [because] we didn’t play all 40 minutes,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “You’ve got to be able to close games out on the road.”
Despite the meltdown in Tempe, USC still enters the Pac-12 Tournament on Wednesday as a young, scrappy team with sleeper potential. A solid showing at the conference tournament this week could significantly brighten its postseason outlook. 
After defeating Washington at the Galen Center, 74-58, on Saturday, the Trojans will square off with the Huskies once again four days later in the opening round of the Pac-12 Tournament on Wednesday.
A USC win over Washington in the opening round would pit the Trojans against a No. 3 UCLA team that won its final nine games of the regular season. If USC can replicate its Jan. 26 upset over the Bruins this week at the T-Mobile Arena, the Trojans would advance to the Pac-12 semifinals and likely boost their seeding in the NCAA Tournament. 
Now, about March Madness: This is where USC can cement itself as a true “program on the rise.” In his most recent Bracketology report released on Monday morning, ESPN college basketball analyst Joe Lunardi projected USC as a No. 12 seed in the West bracket of the national tournament. 
If Lunardi’s projections hold true, USC would square off against
No. 12 SMU in the first round of March Madness. USC defeated SMU earlier this season, 78-73, at the Galen Center on Nov. 25. Should the Trojans top the Mustangs for a second time this season, they will advance to the Round of 32, where they could face a team like No. 23 Duke. I ultimately feel that this — the second round of the NCAA Tournament — is where USC’s season will come to an end. 
However, in the case that the Trojans shock the world and advance to the Sweet Sixteen or further, I’m not sure I would label USC a “Cinderella team.”
The regular season saw the Trojans pick up some solid non-conference wins against No. 12 SMU, reigning SEC-champion Texas A&M in College Station and a BYU team that upset then-No. 1 Gonzaga two weeks ago. In conference play, USC upset UCLA and  also played down-to-the-wire games against top-10 Oregon and Arizona teams. USC was the only team in the nation this season to endure a stretch of games in which they played three consecutive games against three opponents (Oregon, UCLA and Arizona) ranked in the top six nationally. The Trojans built up a credible regular season resume, which makes them a viable opponent for anyone in the NCAA Tournament. 
Personnel-wise, the Trojans have the pieces to propel them to a deep postseason run. USC possesses solid leadership in junior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who finished the season playing arguably his best basketball of the season (averaged 19 points, 9.5 assists and 6.5 rebounds per game over his final two games). But USC’s shining star this season has undoubtedly been its youth. A pair of dynamic sophomore forwards in Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu is able to stretch the floor. Meanwhile, even the freshmen have gotten in on the action. Guards De’Anthony Melton and Jonah Mathews and forward Nick Rakocevic have all significantly contributed in their first year. 
At the end of the day, this season will be a success for the Trojans if they can pick up even just one NCAA Tournament victory — anything more would simply be icing on the cake. Back-to-back appearances in March Madness and a tournament win this season would add fuel to the Trojans’ expectations for next season. 
A tournament win — that’s all USC fans should realistically ask for this March. Just one thing, USC: Don’t break the heart of Troy with a miscue on an inbound pass. We’ll take a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to knock us out of the tournament, no problem. Just please don’t screw it up on the inbound — tragically, we’ve been there and done that quite a bit this last year.

Friday night saw an onslaught of raw talent and a kaleidoscope of heartfelt stories about identity, love and passion at Ground Zero Performance Café. 
Sarah Domai | Daily Trojan Matthew Wang, also known as Matt Zurik, won APASA’s annual talent show. Wang, a sophomore majoring in popular music, has worked on a variety of projects since coming to USC.
As part of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly organized its own student-based talent show, APASA’s Got Talent. The event featured a wide array of performances from singing to spoken word and free milkshakes for the first 35 audience members.
Aseem Afsah, APASA’s advocacy chair, elaborated upon his hopes for the event. 
“We’ve the privilege of being the voice of Asian American students,” Afsah said. “Given the social and political climate and conversation about race in the U.S., we have to use that responsibility wisely to continue to advocate for this platform for conversation.”
A spin-off of the popular reality television Got Talent franchise, the popular annual talent show showcased the artistic abilities of USC’s Asian American student community. The night was filled with electrifying performances from eight contestants, each followed by feedback from Fuzzzy, Priska and David Choi. 
One of the performers of the night was Melody Lee, who performed a classical rendition of Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” with a hip-hop twist. Other hidden gems also included Alex Luu, the founder of poetry club Slam SCene, and Izzy Brown, a member of SoCal VoCals. While Luu performed a passionate poem about a bowl of phở to express his Vietnamese identity, Brown chose to sing a cover of Rihanna’s “Love on the Brain.” 
Senior Leo Xia’s performance of his original song “Flame” raised eyebrows and received loud applauses from audience members. Xia successfully used his personal experiences of understanding his identity to resonate with the audience. 
The singer-songwriter, who recently released his EP album Hyphenated, also spoke about how his songwriting journey began with writing love songs in middle school and blossomed in high school and college when he started learning more about his Asian American identity. 
The final contestant winners were revealed at the end of the night. Izzy Brown and Alex Luu were the second and first runner-ups, respectively. The night ended with the announcement of the contest’s winner, Matt Zurik, who carried out a praise-worthy performance with enticing vocals. 
Apart from the contestants’ performances, the guest judges’ performances also proved memorable. Most notably, David Choi’s mellifluous performance of “Missing Piece” touched hearts when he invited a couple to slow dance on stage as he dedicated his song to the audience.
Regarding his thoughts on the event, Choi commented on the event as being the perfect platform to showcase and discover. 
“Our lives are defined by the stories that we tell,” Choi said. He also noted the importance of telling stories from an honest place.  
A night that buzzed until the very last song, APASA’s Got Talent presented different voices and stories that gave life to USC’s Asian American community and created a creative medium for students to express themselves.

Last week I discussed the top 10 ways to motivate yourself to exercise. Within the article, I mentioned that, “working out should not be about getting that ‘spring break body,’ but rather a way to to maintain a healthy lifestyle that promotes a positive body image.” This notion is something I feel is important to further emphasize as it is a prevalent problem with spring break right around the corner. There seems to be an unspoken pressure to have a “spring break body.” Unfortunately, this image is associated with a false sense of beauty shaped by social media and our peers. Therefore, it is important to understand how to handle this detrimental term — with a twist.
The first step toward changing the narrative of the term “spring break body” starts with your personal mindset. It is important to view health as measured by strength and not skinniness. However, with people getting ready to show off their bodies over spring break, it is easy to sink into self-consciousness. It is critical to remind yourself that beauty is not limited to a single definition, as there is no one body type that is considered socially acceptable. Start by changing your own mindset of what your health goal is by focusing more on feeling good about yourself and stressing less about the number on the scale.
The next step towards rethinking the term “spring break body” is through social media. It is important to remember that social media has the power to portray an unfair stereotype of what society believes is beautiful. It is our responsibility as social media users to promote different ideas of beauty and not limit the term to a certain look. It can be hard not to compare oneself to bloggers, models, or even our friends that post photos on social media. Nevertheless, it is vital to remember that you should never compare yourself to others. If you focus on yourself and do not let social media influence you, you will be much happier.
Finally, it is important to make a change in your community when it comes to promoting a positive self-image. Most likely the term “spring break body,” is followed by an expression along the lines of “ugh, I am not ready to wear a bikini.” Remind your friends there is not right or wrong time to wear a piece of clothing. This phrase does not only apply to girls and bikinis, but also guys who feel an unspoken pressure to look “fit.” Therefore, I highly encourage you to speak up and be an advocate for a healthy body image in order to stop the trend of self-deprecation.
