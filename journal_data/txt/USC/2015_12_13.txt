Once I get home, I’m greeted by this Nativity scene, composed of figurines my host mom’s dad brought back from Mexico.

It’s pretty rare for a Spaniard to have a real Christmas tree, but there’s something precious about this little tree my host family’s put up. No matter where you are, the holidays are a great to appreciate everything you have!

‘Tis the season for sweaters, particularly the beloved ugly Christmas sweaters that have emerged as an ironic trend. However, instead of digging through your closet for that sweater Grandma gave you five years ago, shop through the abundance of options online. Christmas sweaters not only spread holiday cheer, but also comment on the best pop culture moments of the past year. Check out some of our favorites below. 
This site had some of the best options by far, and had me doubled over with laughter as I scrolled through the options. My favorite though has to be the Santa-themed spoof on Kim Kardashian’s Paper magazine shoot that “broke the internet.” While the sweaters are a bit pricey, you are sure to be the center of attention at any holiday party.

In case you have been living under a rock, Amazon has everything and anything you could ever want whether it is necessary or not. I am going to go ahead and say that this Fresh Prince Christmas-themed sweatshirt is a vital addition to your closet. Break free of the traditional mold and channel your inner hipster with the pullover crewneck. Nothing says “happy holidays” like Will Smith in a Santa hat.

For those that believe that wearing ugly Christmas sweaters should not come at the cost of fashion, Wildfox has you covered. Though it is not so much ugly as it is understated, one of Wildfox’s sweaters is a great purchase if you want something you can wear more than just once. Throw on this ultra-chic and comfortable sweater with a pair of jeans, boots, and maybe some earmuffs for the perfect festive ensemble.

This website has you covered if your mission is to light up the room this holiday season. Their sweaters have built-in light bulbs on embroidered wreaths and trees. Those with lights are on the pricier side, but they are certainly memorable and are an instant holiday classic that will last you through the years. Shop their site ASAP though because the products are one of a kind.
