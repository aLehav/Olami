Dana Gioia, Judge Widney Professor of Poetry and Public Culture, was named the recipient of the Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry on Tuesday.
Gioia will be presented with his award on Feb. 19 at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn. The University of the South, which administers the award, cited Gioia’s poems as well as his impact on poetry in its decision to grant him the award.
“He, more than any other poet chosen [for the award] in 28 years, has supported poetry in more roles than just as a writer,” said Leigh Anne Couch, managing editor of the Sewanee Review. “In his time with the [National Endowment for the Arts] and as [a] teacher, he has highlighted the role of poetry in American society through his lectures and his activism on the page, as well as in his actions.”
Along with his poetic skills, Gioia is also well-versed in other fields. According to a USC press release, for years Gioia was known as the “business poet” because he earned an MBA from Stanford University, and later became the vice president of marketing for the General Foods Corporation.
Gioia attributes his unique approach to poetry to his childhood in Los Angeles. He was raised by a Sicilian father and a Mexican mother, and was the first in his family to attend college.
The poet mentioned that much of his success stems from his unique background. In addition to the Aiken Taylor Award, Gioia won the American Book Award for his third collection of poems, Interrogations at Noon.
“When growing up in L.A. in the ’60s, how can you not recognize the cultural energy around you?” Gioia said in a press release. “How do you transform that level of intensity to the solely verbal form that poetry requires?”
Gioia has released four poetry books, translated two collections of poetry, written three collections of criticism and three opera libretti. He has been an editor for numerous anthologies and handbooks.
As a recipient of the Aiken Taylor Award, Gioia joins a group of 27 previous award recipients, such as W.S. Merwin, Gwendolyn Brooks and Billy Collins.
“The award is given to a formal American poet to support formalism and all of its different [devices] in American poetry,”  Couch said. “[Gioia’s] formalism pushes against the structure and he is a poet at the height of his career.”

On Tuesday evening in Doheny Memorial Library, Professor and Wallis Annenberg Chair in Communication, Technology and Society Manuel Castells discussed his latest book Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age as part of Provost Elizabeth Garrett’s Writers Series that recognizes outstanding literary accomplishments at USC.
Author · Professor Manuel Castells discussed the relationship between the internet and social uprisings at Doheny Memorial Library. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
The book examines the impact of the Internet and social media on populist revolts such as the Arab Spring and the Occupy Wall Street movement.
“Throughout history, social movements have been the levers of social change,” Castells said. “They are not the heroes of history, necessarily, they can be the villains, but they are the makers of history.”
Castells noted that while these social movements might take place in strikingly different contexts, they all have similar characteristics. Furthermore, these movements do not occur in isolation, such as how the uprising in Tunisia led to uprisings throughout the Arab world.
“In all the movements there is one word repeated almost literally: dignity,” he said. “That is what we all want: to be respected as human beings.”
Castells dismissed the idea that technology causes uprisings, arguing that such movements have occurred before the advent of the Internet and social media.
Castells noted, however, that changes in technology have profound effects on a movement’s efficacy. He spoke about the role the Internet plays in modern social movements, specifically its ability to unite previously separate networks of people.
“It is this multiplicity of networks that gives modern social movements their power,” Castells said.
He noted they do not need a leader or centralized command because the individual networks can maintain their own members, which thus reduces the vulnerability of the movement.
“The regime cannot go around and simply round up the usual suspects — first of all, because they are not usual, they are new — and second because no one knows who they are,” Castells said.
He also stressed that the fragmentation of leadership protects a movement against the “internal dangers” of bureaucracy and stagnation. Such movements are also incredibly self-reflective because they contain so many distinct voices and opinions.
Castells also spoke about the immense power of going viral, and how the Internet has transformed all movements into global movements. He mentioned the power of images in particular, and the crucial role YouTube plays in modern social movements. Images of brutality and solidarity are particularly powerful because they can evoke the emotions of outrage and hope, which he calls “the most powerful emotions according to neuroscience.”
The ability to influence people’s emotions makes the message of such movements universal, rather than limited to a particular area or issue.
“All these movements are local and global at the same time,” Castells said. “[The movements are] local because they arise out of local concerns, and global because they can immediately connect to other movements.”
Toward the end of his talk, Castells focused on the “So What?” aspect of social movements. He said that while people can debate the outcomes of these movements, it is impossible to deny their impacts.
“Take, for example, the case of Egypt,” he said. “In one month, it brought down the oldest dictatorship in [the region].”

Olympic gold medalists Rebecca Soni, DeeDee Trotter and Cynthia Cooper-Dyke talked about their journeys from student-athletes to coaches at Tuesday night’s “USC in the Olympics” panel in Bovard Auditorium.
Trojan Olympians · (From left to right): Rebecca Soni, Cynthia Cooper-Dyke and DeeDee Trotter spoke about their emotions and experiences while competing in the Olympics at Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday evening. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
Soni, Trotter and Cooper-Dyke medaled in swimming, track and field and basketball, respectively.
Organized by the Program Board’s Trojan Pride and Speakers Committee, the panel was moderated by Professor Daniel Durbin, who teaches sports media among a variety of other things at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Trojan Pride’s director Kyleen Marcella said that an Olympic panel was something they had been talking about for a while due to the history USC has in the Olympics. The two committees wanted to host the panel before the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
“We wanted to focus not just on the Olympic games, but what it means to be a student-athlete at USC competing at such a top level and what it’s like to be a role model and coach for these student-athletes,” Marcella said. “DeeDee, Rebecca and Coach Cooper are not only Olympians, but role models for the students they continue to coach and teach at the school. We think it’s important to highlight USC’s history in the Olympics and the people that continue to make our school successful.”
Volunteer assistant coach for track and field DeeDee Trotter arrived at USC only                            three-and-a-half months ago.
“I got into track and field by accident,” Trotter said. “I didn’t have track dreams growing up, but I was just fast.”
Speaking about her coaching experience at USC, she stated that it was a pleasure to be training such a talented set of people.
“It’s so great because they look up to you, and respect you, and listen to what you have to say and the advice you have for them,” Trotter said.
Cooper-Dyke, head coach of the women’s basketball team, started playing basketball when she was 15.
“I came to USC at the last minute because we won the high school championship, and they offered me a spot,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I believe in working harder than everyone else, rather than just being better than them. When I made the Olympic team I was shocked, but more so that I was going to the Olympics rather than just making the team.”
Soni, the first woman to finish the 200-meter breaststroke in less than 2 minutes and 20 seconds, said that her experience in the Olympics was an award in itself.
“[It is all about your] hard work paying off, and just being able to represent your country.”
She also said that she’s always excited to come to USC because she enjoys seeing all the changes on campus.
“I’m really excited for the new changes, including Heritage Hall and the new aquatic center,” Soni said.
The three women also agreed that the Olympics were a surreal experience and that standing on the podium to receive their medal was the best part aside from the opening ceremonies.
“You can’t put into words what you actually experience when you walk into the stadium,”          Cooper-Dyke said.
Students in attendance were incredibly excited to be hearing the athletes talk about their journeys.
Saleeta Rajwani, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, was especially interested in the panel’s ties to the Trojan Family.
“I’m just so excited to hear them talk especially since they went to USC, you know?” she said. “It’s great that they came back to USC to talk about their experiences.”
Kelly Lynch, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, said she was excited that the Olympians would take time out of their schedules to talk to students.
“For all the athletes, and everyone else too, it’s so inspiring that people at such a high level of sports are here with us to talk to us, and are from USC,” she said.

Tuesday night’s weekly USG Senate meeting featured a presentation from the International Students’ Assembly, a branch of USG’s Program Board designed to give international students at USC a welcoming and safe atmosphere.
One of ISA’s goals for the spring semester is to improve orientation for international students, so Trojans arriving from outside the United States can transition smoothly during their freshman year.
Members of the assembly are currently working with orientation advisors to design programs and support systems specifically for international students whose transitional experiences might be more extreme than those of their stateside peers.
“We want a welcome reception when international students arrive from the airport,” said ISA Director Nicholyn Chen. “We don’t want them to feel alone when they arrive in this country.”
ISA continues to sponsor and promote events that are geared toward international students. The organization notes that often international students believe it’s difficult to access the university’s resources and support system, or that they are not entitled to these things.
“A lot of international students have concerns or needs, but they don’t know how to voice their concerns, or they don’t feel they have a right to speak out,” Chen said.
ISA is working with officials and advisors to address this issue. In the past, the organization has found that sponsoring               cross-cultural events is an effective means of connecting international students with the rest of the student body.
In this spirit, ISA continues to promote on-campus events. The organization is particularly excited about a planned International Film Week that will take place next week in Taper Hall of the Humanities.
From 6:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.              Feb. 10-14, USC students will have the opportunity to view films made in countries outside the United States, including those from India and China.
ISA is promoting other events this semester, including an international food fair and a soccer tournament in anticipation of the World Cup.

On Tuesday the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded USC a $1.9 million grant that will support graduate and postdoctoral students in digital humanities. The funds will be implemented through digitization of research materials, workshops, fellowships and coursework that can be applied to a digital humanities certificate through the Institute for Multimedia Literacy in the School of Cinematic Arts.
The grant, which is one in a series of grants from the Mellon Foundation, will allow students and researchers to utilize digital technology within subjects such as literature, philosophy and anthropology.
“For people training in old and traditional disciplines, we can use new hardware and new software to think about research in new ways and take advantage of technology and see things that we maybe didn’t see before,” said Peter Mancall, vice dean of humanities at Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Science.
Mancall said the grant will give students opportunities to research undiscovered patterns. As an example, Mancall said students interested in Shakespeare can utilize software to see patterns in Shakespeare’s writing that people have not studied before.
“They can utilize a digitized archive and link to other archives. That couldn’t happen before because it was too                                     time-consuming to look at big data like that,” Mancall said.
Within the next decade, USC hopes to invest $1 billion toward the support of digital knowledge and informatics.
“Our century is dominated by the quantity and influence of information and data. USC is already a world leader in digital media and informatics,” said Elizabeth Garrett, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, in a press release. “This prestigious award will help to enhance our teaching and scholarship through new ways to explore and communicate.”
The university’s dedication to digital technology is demonstrated particularly through the strength of the Media Arts + Practice program as well as the Digital Repository, which holds more than 52,000 testimonials from the Shoah Foundation.
Currently, the programs funded by the Mellon Foundation grant will only be utilized at the graduate level. Mancall, however, said summer courses are expected to be available to select undergraduates starting in 2015.
In order to promote the spread of digital scholarship, the Mellon Foundation and USC agreed that all researchers supported by the grant will make their digital sources available to the scholarly community through the Digital Repository.
Mancall said he hopes that the possibilities stemming from the grant will reveal the importance of college-level humanities.
“I want to establish USC as a central place for the international center for digital humanities,” Mancall said.  “People talk about humanities in crisis and declining because students are moving toward professional schools. I hope this grant will show the central importance of humanities and show how cool humanities can be.”

USC women’s lacrosse was picked to finish third going into its second season in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation by the conference’s head coaches. After finishing fourth in the MPSF last year, the Women of Troy return nearly every major contributor from their inaugural 2013 campaign in which they finished 8-10 overall and 5-3 in conference play.
Leading the charge · Sophomore midfielder Caroline de Lyra led USC with 51 goals last season, its first year as a Division I program. The team added a top-10 recruiting class to its already-strong roster going into 2014. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Sophomores Caroline de Lyra (attack/midfield), Amanda Johansen (midfield), Caroline Cordrey (attack) and Paige Bonomi (attack) all scored more than 40 points in 18 games in 2013. Furthermore, sophomores Haleigh Dalmass (midfield), Liz Shaeffer (goalie), Courtney Tarleton (defense) and Kelsey Dreyer (defense) started 15 games or more in their freshman seasons.
After starting a lineup of almost entirely freshmen from its first recruiting class as a Division I program in 2013, USC is predicted to improve on its first year finish in league play. The Women of Troy will host six consecutive home games at McAlister Field before spring recess, including five nonconference games against East Coast opponents along with one MPSF matchup against UC Davis.
USC opens the season Feb. 28 at 3 p.m. against the Marist Red Foxes. Both teams fell short of an automatic NCAA Tournament bid last season in their respective conference tournaments. Princeton presents a difficult test to cap off the homestand on March 19 before the Women of Troy travel to Amherst, Mass. to attempt to avenge last season’s 18-9 defeat to the Minutewomen of Massachusetts.
The Women of Troy are scheduled for three television appearances this season, including conference games against Colorado on the road and Stanford in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum airing on Pac-12 Networks. USC will also appear on the Big Ten Network on April 26 against national powerhouse Northwestern in the first ever lacrosse game played at Wrigley Field in Chicago. USC’s Pac-12 Networks web portal will stream the remaining home games live on USCTrojans.com.
Nicely written and very informative. Go Women of Troy!

The Super Bowl is finally over: The media circus has subsided, the game has been played, snacks were devoured, Tim Tebow got a contract to talk about how he didn’t need a contract and, oh yeah, the Seahawks won. They didn’t just win: They made the game boring. At halftime it was 22-0 with an unbearable number of close-ups of Peyton Manning looking more uncomfortable than John Boehner during the State of the Union Address.
The mastermind behind the victory, of course, was none other than former USC head coach Pete Carroll. So when time expired, as a USC football fan above all things, I was a bit conflicted. Do I cheer? Am I happy for Pete Carroll?
To rub salt on my imaginary wound, in his post-Super Bowl press conference, Carroll likened the Seahawk’s 43-8 victory to the Trojans’ 55-19 swamping of the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2005 BCS National Championship game. It’s a strange sentiment coming from someone who, most Trojans believe, hightailed it out of Los Angeles in the face of NCAA sanctions.
The argument against Carroll is this: He left at an inopportune time. He didn’t embrace the Trojan spirit — he didn’t “Fight On.” As the saying goes, when the going got tough, Pete got going. It seemed that he left almost as quickly as he enamored himself to the USC faithful.
On the morning of National Signing Day, the impact of the sanctions from the Carroll era linger: The Trojans are in the last year of their scholarship reduction, and will once again roll out a thinner roster than their competitors. The finger-pointing involving NCAA sanctions could last forever, but here’s why we can’t blame Carroll: The coach of the Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks was, more or less, the same coach who recruited players at the college level for USC.
But really, Pete Carroll did fight on — if you only consider his NFL career. He faltered in his first try at the helm of the New York Jets (6-10) and had a pair of playoff appearances but fell short of massive expectations in New England (27-21) before he was fired. In April of 2009, NFL Films named him one of the top 10 “Coaches Who Belonged in College” when weighing his NFL failures against his success at USC.
With last Sunday’s Super Bowl win, Carroll went from a coach who “belonged in college” to the hottest coach in American sports.
The Seahawks’ coach knows how to generate excitement — whether it’s bringing in Will Ferrell and Snoop Dogg on the sidelines at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, or Macklemore and Ryan Lewis to the Seahawk locker room. Above all things, Carroll is the consummate optimist. In an interview with former 49ers quarterback and ESPN analyst Steve Young, Carroll revealed his coaching philosophy that was developed in his years at USC.
“Really what we did at ’SC, we tried to take care of the whole person and love these guys up and figure out what they could possibly become and then help them get there,” Carroll said. “You’ve got to create a vision for that kid. You’ve got to get them to buy in and then you coach them with that thought in mind. You do that with every person in the program. You treat everybody with great respect in that regard … You don’t have to worry about the games. That’s not even part of our thinking. We’re just trying to do the best we can do, knowing when we do that, we’re really hard to beat.”
It’s impossible to hate Carroll as a person, and it’s tough to speak ill of his character when it’s amply evident that his positive attitude has led him to coaching success. Something about the culture in Carroll’s programs gives players a sense of calm in times of high duress, especially considering the Seahawks’ seemingly calculated dismantling of the Broncos in the Super Bowl.
The argument for the Trojans supporting Carroll’s newfound professional football success is this: He was a Trojan once. He brought a culture of positivity to the Trojan locker room, a sense of brotherhood in the football program that echoed with Ed Orgeron’s “One Team, One Heartbeat” mantra last season. And as the saying goes: Once a Trojan, always a Trojan. Pete Carroll is a Trojan, in every sense of the word. It’s time we give him credit for representing USC.

Coach Carroll is the greatest USC and NFL coach ever! With all due respect, many hail John McKay as the greatest, but I think Carroll deserves that honor. He joins the ranks of Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer to have won both a natty and Superbowl, a difficult feat indeed. Carroll is a reminder of the aphorisms “repeated effort; learn from your mistakes; don’t repeat them; determination.”  Too often, popular media shrugs off those who fail in the beginning insinuating that they’ll never come back. NFL films, ESPN and other so called experts don’t know jack. Like Richard Sherman said, “Don’t ever underestimate us!”

On Tuesday, the Pac-12  announced that junior Yannick Hanfmann had earned its Player of the Week award.
The Karlsruhe, Germany native has yet to drop a set in singles or doubles play this season for the Trojans, proving instrumental in USC’s undefeated start to this season.
Undefeated · Junior Yannick Hanfmann has opened up the season without dropping a set for the Trojans in either singles or doubles. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Last weekend, USC hosted the inaugural Pac-12/SEC Showdown, where the No. 4 Trojans battled the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs and the No. 11 Florida Gators. Against Georgia, Hanfmann and his doubles partner, senior Ray Sarmiento, set the tone by taking home a 6-2 victory over Georgia’s top doubles squad in Hernus Pieters and Ben Wagland. The doubles team of Hanfmann and Sarmiento are unranked by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, while Pieters and Wagland are ranked 12th in the nation.
After USC narrowly won the doubles point, Hanfmann, ranked No. 32 by the ITA in singles, gave the Trojans a 2-0 lead with his straight-set victory over Georgia’s Nathan Pasha on court two. The first set was close, but Hanfmann turned up the heat in the tiebreak and never looked back, upsetting No. 21 Pasha by a score of 6-5, 6-1.
Hanfmann delivered a similar performance in USC’s match against Florida. At the top doubles spot, he and Sarmiento vanquished their opponents, Stephane Piro and Michael Alford, 6-3, to clinch the doubles point for the Trojans.
In singles, he again took the first set over his opponent in a nail-biting tiebreak, but flexed his muscle in the second set, ultimately winning his match against Florida’s No. 28 Piro, 6-5(5), 6-2.
Hanfmann has been battling injury since last season, but that hasn’t stopped him from maintaining success. His help in leading the Trojans to two sweeps of their opponents propelled USC to the No. 3 slot in the nation in the latest ITA rankings.
In the first round of the ITA Kick-Off Weekend tournament last month, Hanfmann took Sarmiento’s place at the top singles slot and delivered a strong performance, leading his opponent 6-2, 4-3 before his teammates clinched the match and suspended play for the rest of the Trojans.
During the fall season, Hanfmann took home the singles crown at the ITA Southwest Regional Championship, taking down Pepperdine’s Alex Sarkissian, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0.
Last season, Hanfmann strung together a remarkable 17-match winning streak, alternating between courts two, three, four and five for the Trojans.
This is the first time this season a Trojan has won Pac-12 Player of the Week and it is the fourth time Hanfmann has earned it in his USC career.

Max Wittek came to USC as a highly touted early enrollee in the spring of 2011. Immediately named the heir apparent to fellow Mater Dei-Santa Ana High School graduate Matt Barkley, Wittek struggled to live up to high expectations and is set to transfer from USC after the spring semester.
Turning the page · Max Wittek started twice at the end of the 2012 season in place of an injured Matt Barkley. Wittek lost the starting job early this season to fellow redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Daily Trojan associate managing editor Will Laws sat down with Wittek Tuesday to discuss his time at USC and his future plans.
 
DT: What went into your decision to transfer?
Wittek: Thinking about everything, the fact I’ll have my degree from USC [in May], I think that’s really irreplaceable. Then the fact I’ll have two years to play, and I’ll be able to play right away … I don’t want to say it’s a new beginning, but it is, essentially. It came down to a feel for me. Just being here, I’ve had such a great time, but I’m able to move on and play for two years somewhere else while I work on my Master’s — couldn’t really pass that up.
 
DT: There were some reports that came out that said when Sarkisian was hired, you had been convinced to stay. Was that true?
Wittek: No, that wasn’t true. I talked to him a couple times and he said the position is open. But again, I took it down to every little level, playing with all the scenarios in my head, and I ended up coming to the decision that the best thing for me would be to get a USC degree and then move on.
 
DT: Have you started to narrow down the schools yet?
Wittek: No, not really. It’s only just begun, really. I’ve been getting a lot of calls, getting a lot of emails, so it’s definitely fun being able to go through this recruiting process twice. I get five more visits, so being able to see some great universities is going to be very valuable.
 
DT: What are you going to be looking for in a school at this point in your career?
Wittek: I’m going to be looking for a great relationship with the coaching staff. Being a graduate student, my class obligations will probably be less than what they have been. So I’m going to be spending a lot of extra time with [the coaches]. And then really, just a place I enjoy being and a place I’ll be able to go out on the field and show what I can do.
DT: Will you favor a smaller school where you might have a starting spot waiting for you or a bigger school with more program prestige?
Wittek: These are all things that’ll go into the decision. Like you said, a smaller school probably has a better chance of saying, “The second you step on campus, we’re gonna name you the starter”. It’ll be a pretty big factor. Regardless of where you are, as long as you get something on tape, you have a better chance [to make it to the NFL] than if you don’t. So it’ll definitely be a big factor, but we’ll see how it plays out.
 
DT: Over your time at USC, you’ve competed a lot with Cody Kessler. Before the starting job, even, for the backup spot behind Matt Barkley. What was the dynamic between you guys during all that?
Wittek: It’s actually been pretty incredible. We never had any bad blood at any moment. When you come to a place like USC, you expect to have competition every single day. That’s what makes places like USC so great. Myself and Cody, we pushed each other to become who we are today. I think he’d say the same. I wouldn’t be the same quarterback without him, and I don’t think he’d be the same quarterback without me. We’ve always had a good relationship.
 
DT: Do you think the Washington State loss forced Kiffin’s hand to make a decision at that point?
Wittek: Yeah, absolutely. Basically the way everything unfolded, he was put in a position he had to make a decision. And that’s just the way the cookie crumbled. A lot of people ask me, “Do you think what happened was unfair?” and I just say the same thing: Whether it was fair or unfair, it was the reality of the situation. I’m not going to dwell on if I think I got [benched] fairly. I’ve enjoyed every second I’ve had at USC, and I’m going to enjoy the rest of the semester at this great place, get my degree and move on.
 
DT: So when you look back at your time at USC, what do you think will be your favorite memory?
Wittek: I’d probably say my first year here when we went 10-2. There were 2 games that stuck out in my mind. Obviously neither myself nor Cody [was] playing at that point, but we learned a lot that year. Going into Notre Dame and Oregon and winning both those games pretty convincingly, those were really cool moments. Being with the whole team and feeling that atmosphere, those were things I’ll never forget.
 
DT: On the other end of the spectrum, was there a bottom point that sticks out?
Wittek: I almost can’t even say there was a bottom point. Obviously, with my competitive nature, I would’ve liked to play last year. That’s just the reality. But I wouldn’t call it a bottom point. I got to spend a lot of time with these teammates that I’ve grown to love. I’ve gotten a lot of support, and a lot of these relationships have been built off respect. Everyone that I’ve talked to has just been like, “Dude, go do your thing, you’re gonna be the man somewhere else”. So it’s hard for me to say I’ve had a bottom point. Even when I’m telling everyone that I’m leaving, all the love and support I’ve gotten has just been incredible.

Wednesday is upon us, which means that the wonderful halfway point in the week has happened, and the weekend is coming fast. Weekends bring a couple of things — free time, sleep, relaxation, sports, parties and food.
As a sports fan, I believe it’s imperative that the right food and drink be provided at sports parties — otherwise, what is the point of going, right? Kidding. Two of my favorite things are sports and food, so to blend them both has to be good. But if that said sports game is anything like the Super Bowl that just happened, the food better make up for the deficit.
This past Sunday I hosted a little get-together with my friends for the Super Bowl and served some delicious eats. I planned a menu ahead of time of the five essentials that should be at a college Super Bowl party — warm cheese dip, guacamole, chips, a main course and, my personal all-time favorite, jalapeño poppers.
Planning a menu and shopping for the groceries seems to always be the most tedious part of the party planning process because you have to consider the occasion, your guests and, ultimately, how much you want to spend in one sitting because the costs of groceries definitely add up.
The usual USC student grocery store, such as Superior Groceries or Ralph’s, sometimes don’t offer the best deals when it comes to produce, so recently I have been buying my produce at the Grand Central Market (located on Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles). Sure, it may be a little removed from campus, but if you have a car or know someone who does, you are set to go.
Menu planning gets really simple when you can purchase six avocados and a 12-ounce package of raspberries for only a dollar each. In the name of food parties, here are a few tips on how to get your fiesta going with a smooth take off.
Grand Central Market is a go-to attraction if you’re not from the L.A. area, so yes, it is a little touristy. But if you’re a local, it is a great place to get fresh vegetables. While walking around you can see all of the different Mom n’ Pop vendors. Try some of the unique food all while getting inspired to create heaping dishes you can serve yourself.
Ever heard of Eggslut? DTLA Cheese? What about Press Brothers Juicery? Loads of foodie inspiration can be found at these places — though a wine and cheese plate may not be something that you should serve at a football or basketball-related party, mini sliders or cheese and crackers are very appropriate.
Okay, so we have some basics covered — sliders, guacamole with chips, cheese and crackers, juice. One main course dish is always a bonus — an excellent way to show off your culinary side.
But if you aren’t the biggest fan of cooking, a fun thing to do is have a potluck-style party — everyone contributes and brings one dish. Potlucks can be great when you have friends who bring too much because usually you get to keep the leftovers.
Great main courses don’t need to be fancy; they can be as simple as an arugula salad with tomatoes and some vinaigrette, or pesto pasta.
Avoid having friends bring chips and dip and tons of soda – that doesn’t really get you anywhere and people’s stomachs won’t be happy if the game isn’t going too well. As humans, we love to wash away our sorrows with delicious food, so make sure that if the team your group is rooting for is losing, you can cover the loss as much as you possibly can with something good.
Dessert — you can never have too many. I had a friend bring Oreo Balls — crumbled Oreo mixed with cream cheese and covered in chocolate. And yes, it was better than it sounds. Cookies are great if you are attending someone else’s potluck as well.
Planning ahead is key and when you pull from all of your resources it is also a breeze, like the winds of change headed in the San Diego Chargers’ direction for next year’s Super Bowl -— maybe it’s unlikely, but a girl can dream.
Here’s to you and your party. May it be a merry good time filled with good conversation and full bellies.

Indie group Broken Bells released their newest album After the Disco, on Tuesday, their latest release since their 2011 EP Meyrin Fields.
I can hear the bells · Brian Burton, better known as Danger Mouse, and James Mercer, lead singer of The Shins make up Broken Bells. This indie group released their sophomore album After the Disco Tuesday. – Photo courtesy of Broken Bells
Broken Bells, comprised of James Mercer, frontman for The Shins, and producer Brian Burton, better known to the music world as Danger Mouse, has released a record that doesn’t live up to the names behind the group. Drowning in muddled production and monotonous vocals, After the Disco poises itself to fade into the background as better albums are released in 2014.
The album begins with the track “A Perfect World,” which features a driving back beat and plenty of danceable synths laid on top. Reminiscent of pop groups such as the Killers, the track proves to be a generic dance-pop number, with neither the vocals nor the production generating the interest that a beginning track on an album requires.
“A Perfect World” is followed by the title track, featuring much more memorable production. With a pronounced bass line and danceable disco chords, Mercer’s falsetto holds traces of Motown grooves on this track, and holds the strongest potential for a successful single and radio hit.
The next track, “Holding On For Life,” also holds strong potential as a radio hit. A slower track than the first two on the album, it holds clear rhythm & blues and slower disco influences and will most likely find its way onto listeners’ mellower, late-night playlists. Compared to the slower tracks later on the album, “Holding On For Life” emerges as a more cohesive and sonically pleasing song.
On “Leave It Alone,” Mercer’s clear, ringing voice and the backing acoustics and vocals make this a song that was intended to be sung by giant stadium crowds. The generic song structure and tired melodic line, however, make this a track that quickly fades from listeners’ memories.
Vocals and production sound muddled on “The Changing Lights,” with Mercer and the backing vocals drowning in the background music. The song does have some good solo instrumental periods, with bumping guitar lines, but has no clear direction or memorable moments.
“Control” follows on the album, with unmemorable lyrics and melodic lines. At this point in the album it becomes clear that most of the tracks on After the Disco only shine through on the instrumental portions where the production picks up some authority and presence.
The lazy-day atmosphere comes through on “Lazy Wonderland,” but the track is by no means a wonderland. Mercer’s voice is nothing spectacular, and Burton’s production is subpar.
By the time listeners get to the album’s hit, “Medicine,” every cut on the album has melded together into an unclear artistic statement. There is neither progression nor diversity in the song structures or production elements.
“No Matter What You’re Told” features plenty of bouncing beats and cheery vocals, but descends into a mediocre pop track as it progresses. The synths, which appeared at the beginning of the album to be a foundational production element in distinguishing Broken Bells’ tracks from the rest of the pack, have now dissolved into static background noise. Mercer’s lyrics don’t maintain any hold on the listener, and instead become another generic element in a generic song.
It is clear that the track “Angel and the Fool” was meant to be the long rock ballad that functioned as a grandiose summation of the album. Unfortunately, the overlaid guitar chords and the wavering vocals aren’t particularly enjoyable or special, and for the fans who choose to turn off the music at this point, they’ll miss the vaguely interesting instrumental breakdown in the last minutes of the song.
Though Broken Bells is comprised of two artists who are both lauded by critics, fans and fellow musicians, neither can bring to this album the spark needed to make it memorable. In the end, After the Disco comes out as a mediocre record made by two incredibly talented musicians who can’t seem to find any collaborative spark.
Fans of dance-pop groups such as The Killers will find plenty to like about this album. For music lovers who are looking for more varied development in their dance-pop tracks, After the Disco will be indistinguishable from the scores of records within this genre that are released throughout the year.

Only two studio albums into their career, New Zealand alternative rock band The Naked and Famous is set to embark on a stadium tour that will bring them to The Forum in Inglewood on Feb. 14.
The band will be opening for Imagine Dragons, another alternative band whose meteoric rise to popularity has turned heads over the past year.
Not bad for The Naked and Famous, a band that lead singer Alisa Xayalith described as being “really poor” in 2006 when they first started recording in Auckland, New Zealand.
“We all had day jobs,” Xayalith said of the band during its early days. “We would go to our jobs, roll into the studio, stay up till 3 a.m., get up again at 6 a.m., go to work and then go back to the studio. We sacrificed a lot to work, write and record. That kind of ethos hasn’t changed for us.”
The band used the momentum from these early recordings to put out its first bona fide hit: the glistening synthpop gem “Young Blood,” which topped the charts in their native New Zealand and brought the band international attention.
“Young Blood,” in addition to the band’s follow-up single “Punching in a Dream,” is exactly the sort of polished anthem that typically fares well in the stadium and festival settings the band will be facing in the coming months.
Among these dates are appearances at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which the band will play at both of the festival’s two weekends.
“We play all the hits,” Xayalith said. “At a festival we have to remember that people aren’t just there to see us — they’re there to see a whole bunch of different bands — so we really try to pick songs with the power to draw people in.”
This isn’t to say that The Naked and Famous isn’t a band lacking in touring experience. The band has maintained a rigorous touring schedule over the past few years that has taken them to the United States several times in the past, including in 2013 when they arrived in Los Angeles to record their sophomore album, In Rolling Waves.
Despite the change in locale, Xayalith said its effect on the music has been negligible, adding that the decision to move to Los Angeles was arbitrary.
“I’m more concerned about my interior world than my environment,” she said. “Your imagination is limitless, whereas your environment is limited.”
In Rolling Waves was released last year and spawned the singles “Hearts Like Ours” and “A Stillness.”
The band rose to popularity in 2010, a time when interest in synthpop had reached a feverish high following the success of bands such as Passion Pit and MGMT.
The album’s glimmering production and strong melodic sensibilities pushed the band into new emotional territory. This was best reflected in its new album’s cover art, a monochromatic gray image of a fragmented flower.
Compared to the bursting color from their first album’s cover, this image suggests a change in the band’s lyrical and sonic territory.
Highlights include recent single “I Kill Giants,” about the death of Xiyalith’s mother, and the woozy pared-down number “Grow Old,” each of which brings a healthy dose of melancholy to the colossal melodies bursting in the bands’ choruses.
In Rolling Waves feels removed from all the hype and comparisons to their contemporaries. It feels personal, like the type of album that would’ve existed with or without the current musical landscape weighing on the band.
Xayalith said she prefers not to think actively about other musicians while working on songs, but noted that she listened to EMA and Apparat while recording the album.
Even though the band was named after a lyric expressing ambivalence to fame by the British rapper Tricky, Xayalith was anything but ambivalent.
“We’re extremely grateful that we get to live this lifestyle,” she said. “As long as The Naked and Famous exists we’re going to focus on our creativity. If it stops becoming about that, we’d quit the band.”
And for any Trojans looking to follow the band’s path into the music industry, Xayalith advises focusing on songwriting.
“What does it come down to? Work on songs,” she said. “Taking everything else out, just work on songs and make sure they’re good. The packaging — how you decide to dress it for the world — is kind of the easy part.”

In the year 2000, a classroom computer was a luxury in my kindergarten class. Yet today as a college student, I feel like the odd one out if I don’t have my laptop out to surf the web in class. Computer technology and Internet access have grown considerably since the advent of the World Wide Web, and on Tuesday President Barack Obama said he has the resources to address the technological divide it has created in our schools.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama emphasized the importance of providing high-speed Internet access to more than 20 million U.S. students in 15,000 schools, according to The New York Times. To achieve this goal, the president announced his ConnectED initiative, which has pledged $750 million in public sector and corporate commitments. The Federal Communications Commission said it will double its contribution to $2 billion. The largest private donations are coming from Apple and Microsoft. And AT&T and Sprint have pledged to contribute free Internet service through their wireless networks.
“In a country where we expect free Wi-Fi with our coffee, we should definitely demand it in our schools,” President Obama said in an announcement on Tuesday.
The U.S. Department of Education has conducted many studies showing that Internet access in the classroom not only makes instructional teaching more efficient and enjoyable, but that it also prepares students for the realities of higher education and the workforce. Computers also open up educational opportunities for those who rely on online classes or are unable to attend school on a regular basis. Yet, according to a statement by White House officials, Internet speed in 70 percent of U.S. schools is operating too slowly.
Within five years, the president seeks to connect 99 percent of the nation’s school-aged students to the Internet. Currently, only 20 percent of students have access. The fear of an established digital underclass in our educational system is currently a reality. In the digital divide, where some students have unrestrained access to Internet and others can rarely go online, the burden of responsibility often falls on government institutions and school systems.
Despite the excitement surrounding bringing all the nation’s schools into the 21st century by improving Internet connection, caution must still be taken — particularly when it comes to the financial and implementation factors.
In broad programs such as these, it is important to ensure that the public understands its monetary contributions. The private sector’s contributions relieve the financial strain on the public and will not require any additional taxes, White House officials said in a statement. Restructuring the E-Rate program will sufficiently fund the program. The E-Rate program was designed to connect schools, rural areas and low-income consumers to affordable telecommunications systems. As the program moves forward, however, taxpayers should ensure that changes in the funding program are not altered dramatically.
Further, the rollout for the ConnectED program must be handled efficiently. If not, federal officials could face the same headache the Los Angeles Unified School District did back in Fall 2013 with its iPad distribution. The first 47 schools to receive iPads reported problems ranging from missing and stolen iPads to students breaking the security barriers and browsing the Internet freely during class, according to the Los Angeles Times. As a result, school officials eventually banned the use of iPads outside of class, and it delayed other schools from receiving their tablets. The unintended consequences led to more energy being spent on solving problems than utilizing the technology available.
In the same way, government and school officials should consider how to regulate technology in the classroom once all K-12 students have broadband access. If not used for the sole purpose of learning, laptops and tablets can be a hindrance in a learning environment.
The government has taken a vital step in recognizing that every student’s learning environment is enhanced by Internet access. The next consideration now must focus on the implementation phase. No one wants technological glitches, especially when it comes to something as important as this.

Last Sunday not only marked Super Bowl XLVIII, but also the 10th anniversary of Janet Jackson’s infamous halftime show “wardrobe malfunction.” The incident, which has since been dubbed “Nipplegate,” occurred during Jackson and fellow performer Justin Timberlake’s performance of “Rock Your Body,” during which Timberlake tore off a piece of the pop diva’s costume to reveal her right breast for a fraction of a second on national television.
Though initially the incident appeared to be accidental, 10 years of hindsight suggest it was a botched stunt on the part of MTV, who was in charge of the halftime show and has since been banned from participating. A decade later, it’s still hard to grasp how conservative the mindset of the country was back then. With 2004 being an election year and patriotic spirit still going strong, something as miniscule as an exposed part of a woman’s body was just the right kind of event to rile up the new “moral majority” that dominated politics and social concern.
It wasn’t even the content of the song the two singers were performing, which had objective lyrics, but just the exposure. Unfortunately for Jackson, not only did she receive the brunt of the blame, but the incident also effectively ended her career. In the end, all Jackson was really guilty of, as far as the public was concerned, was being a woman who accidentally exposed her body.
Jackson being forced to take the blame is indicative of a more systemic problem in the music industry. While Jackson was the only one held accountable, Timberlake immediately distanced himself from the incident, expressing equal distaste and shock at the incident despite the fact that he was the one who originally caused the exposure. A week later, Timberlake went to the GRAMMYs to claim two awards, while Jackson was practically blacklisted by the show, and her post-Super Bowl album flopped.
It’s troubling that in a world where HBO has made topless footage a staple, one single mistake could end a woman’s career. The fallout of Jackson’s controversy alone was fast and far-reaching. Since this incident, every awards show now has a five-second delay, Howard Stern was kicked off of public radio and even movies such as Troy began to edit out topless scenes.
Society has not improved in terms of gender rights. Instead, it has become stagnant. Both Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber have been the subjects of public scrutiny. Though Bieber was arrested for driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an invalid driver’s license, all Cyrus is guilty of is making controversial music videos and posing for risqué magazine covers. This clear double standard won out before, and it continues to plague the industry today.
Even a decade later, American society still seems to be confused and needlessly malicious when it turns on a celebrity figure without first looking at itself. We already see female pop singers as musical mannequins, objectifying them and judging them. Yet when they break out of the mold, we lash out. Beyond the prudishness of getting so worked up over a natural part of a woman’s body, we should be concerning ourselves with what the actual content is and whether we’re just getting what we ultimately asked for.

Every year come February, millions of Americans suddenly become fascinated by television commercials, something usually reviled. Thanks to their ubiquity, high-price, high concept Super Bowl ads can serve as a fascinating cultural barometer.
Following recent trends, this year’s crop continued to go for spectacle, emotion, and cuteness over traditional methods of persuasion. Today’s commercials must strive to appeal to a populous that is cynical toward advertising, while simultaneously pitching a product. As it happens, one of the most subliminal and subtle examples of self-promotion in this new era of advertising was not shown during the Super Bowl. Rather, it can be seen masquerading as a mural, on the side of a loft near Skid Row in Downtown LA.
Foster the People commissioned a mural of the cover of their upcoming album, “Supermodel,” in Downtown Los Angeles. – Photo courtesy of Fresh Independence.
On the night of Thursday, Jan. 23, Mark Foster of Foster the People dedicated the massive work of art after a free concert in an adjoining parking lot. In the middle of his set, he referred to the mural as “a splash of color in the middle of Skid Row.” After the show, he gave a dedication speech, in which he highlighted his band’s motivations for creating the mural.
“For the last three years I’ve lived a block away from where we are right now, and it’s been amazing to be able to witness the cultural renaissance that’s happening downtown right now,” he said. “We wanted to make something outside of music that made this city more beautiful.”
The creation of the mural, designed by the LA-based graphic artist Young & Sick, is the subject of the music video for Foster the People’s latest single “Coming of Age.” The mural depicts what would appear to be a female model, bent over, and vomiting lines of multicolored, psychedelic stream of consciousness. To her left are a number of cartoonish, disembodied arms holding cameras and snapping photos.
Interestingly enough, this image is the exact same art that will appear on Foster the People’s album Supermodel, to be released on March 18. In fact, since the music video for “Coming of Age” was shot, the word “Supermodel” was added to the top left corner of the mural.
Of course, Foster failed to mention that the mural, which was commissioned to beautify the neighborhood, is perhaps the largest billboard in Los Angeles.
The young life of the billboard parallels with a high profile Super Bowl-style ad campaign. The “Coming of Age” video captures the campaign’s birth in a social media-ready clip. The free concert, in which the band also invited concertgoers to add their handprint to the mural, endeared the group to its fans, and yielded over an hour of music video-ready footage for their new album with the dramatic LA skyline and the mural itself as a dramatic backdrop.
The genius of Foster the People’s campaign is that they have consistently managed to retain the integrity and elusive “cool factor” that advertising tends to diminish. It’s the same type of image that established companies vainly attempted to achieve on Super Bowl Sunday by co-opting seemingly incorruptible artistic figures like Bob Dylan, Ben Kingsley, and U2.
Through their impressively subtle campaign, Foster the People manages to prove to its fans that they are altruistic supporters of good causes like Downtown LA’s renewal and the arts. Although this perception does not convey the whole truth, it cannot be denied that the billboard and the accompanying free concert are still more redeeming than conventional ways of advertising. In fact, Foster the People and their marketing team have beat the advertising industry at their own game in its most significant season by marrying subliminal self-promotion and cultural relevance.

Kalie, Kaylee, K-lee, Kaleigh…Whatever. Grassroots promotion is the lingua franca of selling in today’s marketplace. The world will only end when there is no more money left to be made. Until then stay tuned!
This mural is incredible but what I love most is the song. “Coming of Age” represents everything I love about Foster the People and I can’t wait to hear the rest of the album in March :)

The newly renovated Heritage Hall opened to the public Monday after the completion of its $35 million renovation project.
The construction took 16 months to finish and was part of the $300 million Heritage Initiative. The initiative, along with the remodeling of Heritage Hall and the Fred Uytengsu Aquatic Center, provides scholarships for student-athletes, academic support and programming funds.
The hall, which was originally built in 1971, reopened to the public for visitors, guests and students to visit between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
The new structure, originally 48,000 square foot, now boasts 80,000 square feet of athletic facilities and collaborative spaces. The additions include an interactive two-story museum, a women’s athlete lounge, indoor golf driving range and a broadcast studio connected to the  Pac-12 Networks and the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Though the exterior of the building maintained the original design, the inside pays tribute to past and present members of Trojan athletics. The Haden Hall of Champions, named for Athletic Director Pat Haden, consists of a two-story atrium.
The new additions, such as the bronze statue of the drum major flanked by Heisman Trophies, reminds visitors of the great history within USC athletics.
“We think we created a ‘wow factor’ upon entry,” said USC Athletics Chief Innovation Officer Mark Jackson in an interview with Fox Sports.
The bottom floor of the building is home to five athletic                                         teams — women’s crew, women’s golf, women’s lacrosse, women’s soccer and men’s golf. These spaces are connected to the 110,000 square foot John McKay Center via a direct corridor.
Skylar Dunn, a junior majoring in business administration and an employee of USC athletics, noted that the renovation will help USC in recruiting players apart from just football.
“I think it will heavily impact recruiting in sports other than football, which is great,” Dunn said. “People are going to come and play football for ‘SC because of the name, and [the John Mckay Center] already impacts football enough. So Heritage Hall will help other sports who don’t have space in JMC or Galen Center.”
Another addition is the                            one-of-a- kind lounge space for the Women of Troy student-athletes, specifically. It is the first and only space of its kind and offers student-athletes a place to relax.
Natasha Strickland, a member of the women’s cross-country team, said she was excited to use the hall’s new facilities.
“Being recruited for the USC track team while the McKay Center was being built in time for my freshman year — I thought nothing could top it,” Strickland said. “So once I heard that Heritage Hall was being rebuilt, I couldn’t wait.”
Strickland specifically mentioned the new women’s lounge as the hall’s main draw for her.
“Heritage Hall not only provides locker rooms for some of the athletics teams, but I am also very excited to make use of the women’s lounge,” she said. “After working out or studying in the computer lab in McKay, I will definitely go there after to hang out. It even has a room with five lounge chairs just for napping.”
The new hall also holds additions for athlete training. Two golf simulators allow users to choose from 550 golf courses from around the world for practice.
For women’s rowing, the team now has access to a rowing ergometer room complete with 35 ergometer machines that will allow training and preparation.
“I didn’t know there was an outdoors area and I think it really adds a little ‘something-something’ to campus,” said Holly Hepper, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
Divesh Sachdev, a sophomore majoring in biology, was highly impressed upon visiting the hall for the first time .
“Heritage Hall brings out all of USC’s history and tradition of excellence when it comes to athletics,  and this newly renovated building just takes things to a whole other level.”

The third annual USG candidate diversity forum, held in the Rosen Family Screening Theatre, gave students a chance to ask questions on race, sexuality, gender and class.
The USG presidential and vice-presidential candidates present at the forum were Andrew Menard and Rini Sampath, James White and Brigid Kelly, Logan Heley and AJ Pinto. Write-in candidate Jasper                     Abu-Jabar, whose vice-presidential running mate, Harrison James could not make the event, was also present.
Representatives from the Women’s Student Assembly, the International Students’ Assembly, the Latina/o Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly were also in attendance at the forum.
Jonathan Wang, assistant director of Asian Pacific American Student Services, was the moderator, and Kaya Masler, co-executive director of the WSA hosted the event.
The forum began with a brief introduction of the USG presidential and vice presidential candidates, along with Providence Ilisevich, a Greek senator candidate, and Aziz Akbari, a residential senator candidate, both of whom were not on the panel.
When asked to explain whether USC is a diverse campus for all, the candidates had varying opinions. All of the candidates, however, agreed and acknowledged a need for USC to be more welcoming and accepting of everyone who steps foot on campus.
“USC is a diverse place in a sense,” James White said. He added, however, “I do not feel that [USC] is a place that promotes and appreciates diversity.”
Many of the answers from candidates seemed to go back to the same central issues of inclusion, fairness and student involvement.
All of the candidates advocated for students to be more involved in the administrative choices on campus. They also wanted to reach out and represent different types of students.
Shyann Murphy, a member of the executive board of WSA, was one of two students who asked a question during the Q&A of the forum open to the general audience.
Murphy said she attended Monday night’s forum to get a better sense of the candidates’ positions.
“I think it was nice to see the true colors of the candidates [when they] answer questions that they were not prepared to answer,” Murphy said.
Gloria Kim, executive director of APASA, said a lot of the issues the candidates addressed had not been addressed on the campaign and that it was a great space for the conversation to get started.
Alison Chang, assistant director of the APASA, was not as impressed with the forum. She did, however, mention that she was pleased to finally hear the candidates talk about some diversity issues.
“To be honest, I don’t think a lot of our questions were answered, but it was good to at least hear them talk about it for once,” she said.

The USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance unveiled its curriculum yesterday: a four-year intensive program in dance performance and choreography that breaks ground this spring. The school will enroll its first Bachelor of Fine Arts dance majors in the  fall of 2015.
Introductory courses focus on technique, performance and composition, and juniors and seniors can choose concentrations in either cinematic arts or music, which are in collaboration with the USC School of Cinematic Arts and the USC Thornton School of Music, respectively.
The school will combine the rigor of a conservatory-style dance school and the academics of a four-year university.
“The vibrant liberal arts education provided by USC, among the best in the world, will help develop dancers who have a depth of understanding of the human condition,” USC Kaufman Dean Robert A. Cutietta said in an interview with USC News.
Students will work with visiting professional dance companies in residence at Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at the Music Center in Downtown Los Angeles. Dance companies will teach students in master classes in professional development.
“We want a dancer to develop a curious mind about an evolving and dynamic art form,” Cutietta told USC News.
The school also seeks to educate dancers about the realities of the physically demanding art that often leaves careers cut short by injury.
“Understanding the means of staying healthy will prolong a performing career, and understanding the workings of the industry will allow dancers career options long after they have left the stage,” Cutietta told USC News. “A lifelong career in dance will begin here.”
The school’s vice dean and director is dancer, choreographer and educator Jodie Gates. She said that knowledge of other fields such as cinematic arts and music is incredibly important to dancers.
“Dancers today have to be versatile hybrids able to connect the dots between ballet and urban folk dance [hip-hop], and learn how to apply choreography to stage, film, television and mobile devices,” Gates said in an interview with USC News.
After a gift from philanthropist Glorya Kaufman, the Kaufman School was founded in 2012. It is the first new school to be established at USC in 40 years.

Ron Finley, co-founder of the nonprofit L.A. Green Grounds, visited the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Monday night to speak to students about his rise in nonprofit organizations and how his movement could change living in South Central Los Angeles.

In 2010, Finley looked around his neighborhood, which was filled with liquor stores, fast food and vacant lots. He described it as a “food desert” on TED Talks.
“South Central Los Angeles, home of the drive-thru and the drive-by,” Finley said on the TED Talk. “Funny thing is, the          drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills.’”
One of Finley’s missions in his nonprofit is to help break the obesity cycle for future generations.
“ [The children’s] palate has been raised by those types of food,” Finley said. “You are what you eat, it has been proven. If you get these foods in your body in an early age, that is what you are going to eat.”
Finley explained how the improvement of nutrition in South Central could change the future with his nonprofit on TED Talks.
“If kids grow kale, kids eat kale,” Finley said in the talk. “If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. But when none of this is presented to them, if they’re not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of their mouth.”
He continued to explain how that even in a part of town that lacks fresh produce, it is not impossible to eat healthy.
Adjunct professor Gary Wexler, who first noticed the urban gardener on TED Talks, hosted Finley in his class. Wexler previously met with Finley at the Goldhirsh Foundation and is now helping Finley expand his nonprofit organization.
Impressed by his mission and determination, Wexler invited Finley to speak to his nonprofit marketing class to empower them to work with nonprofits.
“Ron Finley is taking a risk,” Wexler said. “He is putting himself out there in a way that social entrepreneurs are putting themselves out there. He is a wave of the future. He’s different because he is willing to take a risk.”
Finley acknowledged several challenges in creating an urban garden. He explains that it is not easy to have everyone understand and support his mission. In addition to getting people involved, he understands that not everyone has time to cook.
His revolution goes further, however, than just establishing an urban garden.
“It is about allowing people [to have] healthy food in neighborhoods — in food deserts,” Finley said. “It’s about getting kids who have been involved in gangs and giving them something to do and change things that they do and the way that they live.”
During the Q&A session, a student asked Finley where the inspiration for his nonprofit came from.
“You have looked at someone who has never been high, drunk off coffee and never smoked,” Finley said. “I never wanted to be drunk. I never needed to be an altered state. If I was with somebody last night, I can remember what I did. I know that I was different.”
Finley revealed to the class that he started the garden to get kids out of jail. He believes that schools are similar to a prison system and children need to be taught how to think instead of what to think.
“And I want to change that. As a matter of fact, I am changing it,” Finley said.
