More than 80 students, faculty and staff members gathered at Town and Gown Wednesday evening to discuss their concerns with mental health stigma on campus, especially in light of the nine student deaths this semester. Undergraduate Student Government, Graduate Student Government and other campus organizations put together the community event, and prominent administrators such as President Carol Folt attended. 
Students have questioned how the administration handles student deaths and whether the University offers adequate mental health resources. The organizers of the event hoped to provide a safe place for students to communicate their concerns with mental health resources on campus and learn about new ones such as the Engemann Student Health Center’s fifth floor, which will open Monday to provide long-term psychiatric services on campus.
“A lot of people are searching for answers, searching for ways to support each other, a lot have reached out to me looking for ways to engage in different initiatives that are happening on campus, whether from USG or other departments,” USG President Trenton Stone told the Daily Trojan.
To ensure student confidentiality, faculty, staff and administrators left the event before the final hour, during which students had their own discussion on these topics.  
“It’s important to hear about resources, it’s important to hear from senior administration and see their support and commitment to try to make improvements,” Stone said. “But it’s also critical as a student Trojan community that we can come together and try to learn from each other, give their own perspectives and organically, really at the grassroots level, figure out how our student body can improve.”
Folt began the first part of the discussion by apologizing for the lack of communication from school administrators. She, along with Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni and Assistant Director of Outreach and Prevention Services Kelly Greco listed the efforts the administration has made thus far to combat mental health stigma, which includes their leave of absence policy that allows students to take as many semesters off without academically or financially penalizing them, along with the free wellness class available for students online. 
When faculty and staff left, students criticized limited on-campus counseling sessions for students that typically require students to seek treatment from outside practices.  
Ana De Oliveira Laub, a senior majoring in neuroscience, told the Daily Trojan the administration needed to better communicate student deaths to the USC community. 
“The administration is lacking in their efforts in communication with the student body. Transparency is clearly an issue that everybody is upset about,” Laub said. “But I think that … speaking up about your ideas, express your interest to be involved and your eagerness to help is what the student body can do right now, as well as making yourself available to your peers who might need help.”
 Laub also voiced a concern with the lack of 24/7 mental health hotlines and long wait times for students scheduling counseling appointments‚ an issue brought up multiple times by students during the forum. 
“If you’re at that point where you’re calling because you need help, you don’t have the patience to listen to elevator music,” she said.
Although Folt and other administrators cited a 50% increase in mental health counselors this academic year, students said there was a lack of people of color and LGBTQ  representation on the staff. 
Students also brought up the lack of empathy from professors when speaking with students about mental health. While fall break was meant to be a mental health break, students said many professors piled on assignments, projects and midterms before and after the long weekend. 
USG Vice President Mahin Tahsin told the Daily Trojan that the USG staff will work to implement ideas raised in the discussion to school administrators. 
“I think these conversations continuing to happen is so integral to sharing that perspective that everyone can collectively bring forward,” Tahsin said. “Whether it’s in big settings like this, or even little pockets could be so influential, and I hope that’s something people did realize out of the event as well.”

On the steps of the Von KleinSmid Center, Tofu the Corgi looks on at USC students passing by, daring them not to stop by to pet her. Tofu visits USC every week with her owner Tiffany Luke, a graduate student studying marketing at the Marshall School of Business. 
After being featured on both the official USC and Marshall Instagram accounts, Tofu became an instant celebrity on campus. 
Luke said she and her fiancé Jonathan Huynh, a USC alumnus, set a goal for Tofu to meet 100 different people before she was 4 months old. Now that she’s 4 years old, Tofu has met so many people that she is instantly comfortable around a crowd of admirers. 
Tofu also attended puppy kindergarten for seven weeks to learn how to socialize with other dogs and was trained by Huynh at home. 
Luke said Tofu loves her weekly trips to USC and knows she’s on campus whenever they pull into the parking lot. 
“It’s funny [that] every time I turn into the parking lot, she knows, and she starts jumping up trying to look and then even if she sees a person walking by us in the car, she’ll start whining because she’s like ‘That person needs to pet me,’” Luke said. “She loves coming on campus, and every time we’re walking from the parking lot, she tries to pull me as fast as I can [walk].”
Tofu has 179,000 followers on Instagram and more than 400,000 followers on TikTok. As she sits on her favorite spot by Trousdale Parkway to watch students pass by, many recognize her from her social media presence and stop by to pet her. 
Luke said she started Tofu’s Instagram account to post pictures of her without annoying her friends on her personal Instagram account. She was surprised at the response she got and did not expect Tofu to get so famous. 
“I started her page, not because I [intended] for her to get a lot of Instagram followers,” Luke said. “It was super strange, but the first month that I made her account, people found us through our hashtags … and then there was one week where we just soared 10,000 followers in a whole week, and then it just kind of grew from there. ”
Luke also started a group called Corgis of USC to form a community of USC corgi owners so that their dogs could play together. The group currently has around 30 corgis and had its first unofficial meeting in September. It is holding a corgi meetup this Sunday to let USC students play with the corgis at the USC Village Great Lawn. 
“I love just the fact that we’re all USC students, and we all have corgis,” Luke said. “It’s just really fun to be able to chat, all about that and also it’s just really cool. It’s like another new friend group for [Tofu], so she has a lot of fun meeting all the other different corgis too.”
During her walks with Tofu, Luke said students love playing with her. As Tofu’s following grew, Luke started selling merchandise like T-shirts, pillows and stickers online. She also hands out stickers of Tofu to the students who come to meet and play with her. 
After seeing how much students loved Tofu, Luke decided to reach out to the social media team at USC to do an Instagram story takeover for the official USC Instagram, which followed Tofu around campus as she bought clothes at the USC Bookstore, attended office hours with campus wellness dog Professor Beau and watched the Spirit of Troy practice.  
In the comments section of a post of Tofu on Instagram, people talked about how much they loved Tofu and how the story had made their weeks. For a lot of USC students who cannot keep pets of their own, following Tofu’s Instagram brings them joy. 
Serena Wang, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she loves seeing Tofu on campus because she can’t have a pet while she’s at USC. 
“I can’t keep a dog myself because I live in a residential hall, so I think it’s good to virtually keep a dog on Instagram,” Wang said. “I love dogs, but I can’t pet them frequently. Just by looking at the post and the Instagram stories, I can feel the comfort.”
Wang also has a sticker of Tofu on her laptop from the time she met her on campus and is looking forward to the corgi meetup taking place on campus Sunday. 
Luke spends about two hours every day on Tofu’s Instagram and TikTok posting content. She said she enjoys replying to people who comment on Tofu’s posts and tries to speak in her voice. 
“I just try whenever I’m running her Instagram page to make sure the focus is on her, and I try to speak in what I think she’s trying to say in her voice,” Luke said. “I’m so incredibly grateful like I never ever imagined getting Tofu, I would have so many people around the world who love her so much.” 
Beatrice Gao, a sophomore majoring in journalism, said she started following Tofu’s Instagram after a friend recommended the account to her, and she was first interested in an Instagram highlight called “Fear of Missing Out.”
The highlight included videos of Tofu running between the bedroom where Luke was and the living room where Huynh was because she didn’t want to miss anything going on in her house. 
“I think her mother [does] a good job in handling all of the social media stuff,” Gao said. “She just posts Tofu’s daily life and in a very conversational and in a dog-like language. It’s very cute. Like, every time I saw Tofu’s [Instagram account], I feel like I’m encouraged, and it just offered me some warmth.”

In front of more than 350 attendees at Town and Gown, Charles “Chip” Zukoski was installed as USC’s provost Wednesday afternoon. In a speech addressed to faculty and leaders, Zukoski spoke about his plans to lead the University in tackling local and global problems.
“The provost is the person who’s responsible for the intellectual vitality of our university,” said President Carol Folt before welcoming Zukoski to the stage. “It’s the provost’s job to help create and nurture the very best environment for teaching and learning to thrive.”
To the Daily Trojan Wednesday, Folt referred to Zukoski as the “right person for the right time at this institution.” During her speech, she referred to him as her closest partner and said his personal qualities make him the best man for the job. Of over 300 applicants, Zukoski was the unanimous first choice for the position, she said. 
“He has a wonderful sense of humor, and he’s very candid,” she said. “He doesn’t sugarcoat truth. He’s a lot of fun. We all have great conversations already and have developed a warm, collaborative relationship amongst the leadership team. But what I think I value the most is that he treats everybody with respect. And he is a great listener. I think he’s exactly the person we were looking for.”
With 35 years of experience in higher education, Zukoski recognized USC as a global leader and a University “poised for change.”
“In characterizing what we see in society around us, we often use ‘challenges’ as a code word for forced, uncomfortable and, perhaps, undesirable change,” he said. “I take a different perspective. I see opportunity.”
Zukoski said the University should also use its resources to tackle global issues such as climate change.
“On climate change, we know how to reduce CO2 emissions,” he said. “We know how to alter land usage to produce better foods. We know how to alter water usage to save streams. Certainly, we need better understanding and technologies to make doing these things easier. But many of the technologies exist, and yet we are making very slow progress. USC can lead the way through the social, cultural and political barriers.”
Zukoski also said USC is facing “challenging financial times” and that the University will have to adjust. However, he said he sees that as a catalyst for change at USC.
“With the abundance that is around us, I encourage us not to be bogged down by notions of scarcity but to embrace the ‘and’ proposition: That we can work within and expand the financial framework that constrains us, and we can accelerate into a fabulous future where USC continues to be known for astonishing programs in research, education, health care and creative endeavors,” he said.
Zukoski emphasized his belief in observing, listening and setting priorities as a leader. 
“I believe in processes of continual renewal and the excitement of shaping programs that deliver value,” he added. “I believe the priorities should be values-based and that decisions should be consistent and predictable.”
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni commended the new provost’s background as a research scientist and his approach to leadership.
“What he did really well today is that he set a vision for the University as a whole,” Soni told the Daily Trojan. “He challenged us to think about how we could get to that. And that vision was inspiring.”
Zukoski replaced interim provost Elizabeth Graddy, who served in the position after Michael Quick stepped down in April. Zukoski worked at the University at Buffalo as both provost and executive vice president for academic affairs since 2012. Before then, he served as vice chancellor for research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Zukoski was accompanied Wednesday by his family, including his wife Barbara Morgan and his two sons.

USC alumnus Toby MacFarlane was sentenced to six months in prison in Boston federal court Wednesday in the longest prison sentence of the college admissions scandal to date. 
MacFarlane will also have to serve one year of supervised release, perform 200 hours of community service and pay a fine of $150,000 after paying a total of $450,000 to USC officials to falsely designate both his children as athletic recruits.
MacFarlane pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in the Operation Varsity Blues scheme in June. He coordinated with William “Rick” Singer, who organized the backdoor scheme in which wealthy parents paid to have their children falsely designated as athletic recruits to be admitted to top universities.
In Fall 2013, MacFarlane and Singer arranged for former assistant women’s soccer coach Laura Janke to falsify an athletic profile for MacFarlane’s daughter. 
Her daughter’s USC application falsely stated that she had been a “U.S. Club Soccer All American” player sophomore through senior year of high school. 
In a drafted application essay emailed to MacFarlane, Singer wrote from the point of view of MacFarlane’s daughter, claiming to be a two-sport athlete, “On the soccer or lacrosse field I am the one who looks like a boy amongst girls with my hair tied up, arms sleeveless and blood and bruises from head to toe … It is true that I can be a bit intense out there on the field.”
That November, MacFarlane’s daughter was presented to an admissions subcommittee. She received an official offer of admission in March 2014. In summer 2014, when a USC athletics academic counselor emailed MacFarlane’s daughter asking her to adjust her class schedule to accommodate travel games, Singer instructed MacFarlane to tell the coach that his daughter had plantar fasciitis, a type of foot tissue inflammation, rendering her unable to play.
That May, MacFarlane paid $200,000 to The Key, one of Singer’s fraudulent foundations that accepted the money, and Singer transferred $100,000 from The Key to a soccer club operated by Janke and former women’s soccer head coach Ali Khosroshahin. 
Janke and Khosroshahin have both been charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering and will be sentenced in federal court in January. 
In Fall 2016, MacFarlane began discussing his son’s admission to USC with Singer. 
Janke created a fake athletic profile for MacFarlane’s son, featuring a photo of him playing basketball procured by MacFarlane’s wife, who was not charged in the case. The profile listed his height as 6 feet 1 inch, 8 inches taller than his actual height. 
It also stated that he had played varsity basketball for his high school for three years. While MacFarlane’s son did play varsity basketball, he had only done so his senior year.
Singer emailed the profile along with the student’s academic information to then-senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who presented MacFarlane’s son to an admissions subcommittee, which granted him conditional admission to the University in February 2017 and formal admission a month later. In April, MacFarlane paid Singer $200,000 for helping his son get into the University. 
MacFarlane’s daughter enrolled at the University in Fall 2014 and graduated in 2018, while his son attended for the 2017-18 academic year but withdrew that May. 
MacFarlane’s sentence is lighter than the 15 months in prison, one year of supervised release and $95,000 fine recommended by federal prosecutors. The maximum sentence he could have received for a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud was 20 years in prison with — in most cases — three years of supervised release and a fine worth twice the gross gain or loss resulting from the offense. 
MacFarlane is the 14th defendant and the 13th parent sentenced in the college admissions scandal. His sentencing comes after those of Jeffrey Bizzack, Jane Buckingham and Agustin Huneeus Jr. last month and Devin Sloane in September.

USC will receive a $260 million gift from the Lord Foundation of California, the University announced Wednesday. The gift ranks as the 34th largest donation to an institute of higher education since 1967, according to a list published by The Chronicle of Higher Education. 
The Lord Foundation of California is a nonprofit organization established to support education and research through donations to USC. The foundation is one of four founded by Thomas Lord, the former president of manufacturing company LORD Corporation. The other three Lord Foundations support the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University and the Cleveland Clinic.
The sale of LORD Corporation in April left sales totaling over $1 billion, which will be divided equally among the four foundations. 
“This gift is such a large gift with so much flexibility that I really see it as a great responsibility to do the right thing, to take the time that it takes to determine how best to use this so that we are really setting up effects that are going to last for the next decade or two,” President Carol Folt told the Daily Trojan.
The University first learned of the possibility of the gift about a month ago, but the donation was only confirmed in the last week and a half, Folt said. She said the University hasn’t determined how the donation will be distributed to specific programs and departments yet, but she called the gift a “game-changer” for USC.
Folt said the foundation has donated annually since the 1980s.
“We’ve used [the donations] every year to help teaching and research programs in engineering and in the business school,” Folt said. “It’s already had a very big impact here, and now we have a chance to say ‘What did we achieve, and how can we expand that and just do the marvelous?’”
In an interview with USC News, Provost Charles Zukoski called the donation “a provost’s dream,” saying that it would accelerate the growth of the University’s research programs.
“The flexibility and scale of this gift allows us to build much more rapidly than normally possible upon cross-university strengths,” Zukoski said. 
Folt said the donation will undergo approvals and other administrative processes over the next year, after which the University will begin to allocate the funds across its schools. The gift’s disbursement will extend across multiple disciplines and emphasize development in areas relevant to the future, including artificial intelligence, analytics and sustainability, Folt said.
“I think it will allow us to address these major societal issues in a way that will really help our University help set a course for us for decades to come,” Folt said.

Behind the No. 78 on Jay Tufele’s chest lies a heart for football, family and tradition.
The redshirt sophomore defensive lineman demonstrates his talent every time he steps on the football field. A reliable force on the Trojans’ front, Tufele has appeared in all 22 games since becoming eligible. This season alone, he’s garnered 32 tackles, 17 solo and five for a loss. 
Last year, he blocked what would have been a game-winning field goal for Washington State and ran back a fumble from Utah quarterback Tyler Huntley for a touchdown.
“When we got that sack-fumble in Utah and I took it to the house, that was probably the most fun [play],” he said. “I was back home, and all my family was there … it was just very exciting.”
Tufele certainly paid his dues before earning a chance on the front lines. The highly sought-after four-star recruit from Salt Lake City, Utah, spent his first year at USC learning the team’s sophisticated defense from the sidelines. He put in countless hours mastering the playbook with his head down, spirits up and attention focused.
As a dedicated student of the sport, Tufele wasted no time getting to know his defensive line coach at the time, Kenechi Udeze. Udeze, a former USC defensive lineman and Minnesota Vikings first-round draft pick, sat with Tufele in his office discussing everything from football technique to personal matters.
“There are some kids who are just empty vessels in the learning environment, and then there are some kids who just shine, and they’re really bright because it means something to them,” Udeze said. “Working with Jay was always a privilege because he always gave you what he had. It was never about effort with Jay Tufele.”
Tufele’s effort serves him far beyond athletic output; his nose-to-the-grindstone attitude also extends to his academic and personal pursuits. 
“If Tufele were to go out there and become President of the United States, or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company … it would not be a surprise to me,” Udeze said. “[He] is one of the greatest workers I’ve ever seen at his age. It’s hard not to stare at him and watch him work.”
Even with the success his work ethic has afforded him, Tufele remains extremely humble. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound lineman is so soft-spoken that post-game reporters strain to hear him. He deflects attention to the efforts of his teammates even when he’s the hero of the day.
Mimi Butler, who has been Tufele’s learning specialist since he arrived at USC two years ago, sees a kind, selfless spirit behind the lineman’s daunting figure.
“Nowadays, everyone always [asks], ‘What’s in it for me?’ and ‘What am I going to get out of this?’ and Jay doesn’t look at life like that,” she said. “It’s like, ‘How can I help my family?’ And I just think that’s cool.”
Tufele’s deep sense of family — whether by blood or by choice — has shaped his identity as a player and as a person. He protects those he cares about off the field and on. For him, those connections are more important than any athletic achievement.
“I’m close with everyone, mostly, [but] probably the D-line [the most],” he said. “They’re the first guys I ever got to know [at USC]. We’ve been together for a while, so we’re just like a bunch of adopted brothers.”
Tufele’s family back in Utah was a driving force throughout his college recruitment process. Udeze worked closely with the recruit’s parents and siblings to ensure USC would be a good fit and, subsequently, to smooth his freshman-year transition.
“Tufele was a bright kid, respectful, very humble and just comes from a great family,” Udeze said. “Through the recruitment process it wasn’t just Tufele and I. It was his sister, his mother, his father [and] it was his little brother.”
Butler echoed that sentiment.
“He loves his family,” she said. “He’s very close to everybody in his family, he’s very connected to his family … he really respects his family so much.”
For Tufele and his family, the decision to commit to USC wasn’t a difficult one. The legacy of success and tradition in both the academic and athletic arenas spoke for itself.
“I came on my visit [to USC] with [redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Marlon Tuipulotu], and … the setting, the campus, walking down the All-American Walk just felt like something special,” Tufele said. “I felt like I wanted to be here, and I wanted to be part of it, to be part of this great legacy and school. It’s rich with tradition, and I love it.” 
Since Tufele set foot on USC’s campus two years ago, he’s embodied the Trojan spirit. From participating in spirit rallies to giving his all during the final moments of nail-biting games, Tufele has worked to embed himself in the school’s culture.
Although Tufele has faced several obstacles in his short career — sitting out his freshman season, losing the coach who mentored him through his first two years of college football in Udeze and balancing the demands of sport and school — the people around him have hardly noticed.
“If Jay had a bad day, I could never tell,” Udeze said. “Jay always had a great spirit about himself … and if you meet his family, you know exactly why Jay is more special than just another young man in a jersey. Jay has so many great skills that are going to help him when he’s done playing the game of football.”
As for the current moment, Tufele is focusing on putting his team in the right position to win games. His meticulous attention to detail lends itself to impressive individual stats, but he’s more focused on what he can contribute to the team as a whole.
“My goal is to make sure that on defense, we’re solid up front and my younger guys know what they’re doing,” Tufele said. “Just being able to take every game one by one … hopefully we do that and we get to the Pac-12 Championship.”
From watching from the sidelines his first year to becoming a defensive powerhouse for the Trojans, Tufele’s humility and work ethic allow him to constantly sharpen his skills.
With two years left of eligibility left at USC before he makes his NFL push, it remains to be seen how much Tufele can accomplish with his positive attitude and love for the game.

In January, I became obsessed with procuring a brown leather tote bag. To me, they symbolized growing up: A graduation from my brightly-hued backpack, which was an essential possession for every sophisticated young female professional. I perused everywhere, from Madewell to Mansur Gavriel, until I settled on a beautifully woven leather tote from Greece-based Etsy shop Milloo. 
I brought the bag to interviews and internships, situations where my Mokuyobi backpack seemed puerile and out of place. In a sea of luxurious Italian leather, the scarlet nylon was a flashing alarm that screamed, “I am still a student!” The tote bag fit right in with all the Goyards and Louis Vuittons, but I never felt comfortable hoisting it around on my arm. I felt like an impostor, a fraud, a little girl dressing up in her mom’s oversized heels. 
Bags become an extension of yourself, more so than any other item in your wardrobe.
After all, I don’t wear the same clothes every day, but I carry the same backpack with me day in and day out. They’re a vessel for transporting all your life essentials — phone, keys and wallet, of course; but also, if you’re anything like me, lip balm, pens, bobby pins, hand sanitizer, notebooks, loose change, Post-it notes, rubber bands, multiple chargers, weeks-old receipts and who knows what else. 
The “What’s in My Bag?” craze challenge that swept YouTube a few years ago –— and still populates the platform to this day — was such a hit precisely because by digging around and revealing the detritus you’ve accumulated, you reveal what kind of person you are. 
Your bag says something about you. Bags have always been a status symbol — think of the obvious luxury designer handbags from Chanel and Hermès. But even in elementary school, the kind of backpack you carried signified whether you were in or out, whether you were cool and in-the-know or whether you were an oblivious ignoramus. 
At first, rolling backpacks were all the rage, and I begged my parents to let me pick one out from the luggage store at the local mall. The backpack hooks lining the buildings of my elementary school went disregarded and unused. Instead, there would be a row of rolling backpacks all lined up shoulder to shoulder, their handles still jutting into the air. 
But all of a sudden, once middle and high school rolled around, rolling backpacks fell out of favor. They were babyish and infantile. We were old now, and it was time we started acting like it. 
The cool thing to do was to stuff your bag with all your textbooks and cause as much strain on your shoulders as possible — but only one shoulder at a time because wearing both straps at once was lame. Slinging your backpack over one shoulder affected a breezy nonchalance that none of us possessed but all of us desperately wanted to project.
Nowadays, at USC, I come across bags of all shapes and sizes. Some signal your membership within an exclusive group, such as those emblazoned with sorority letters. Others are a little more subtle with what they broadcast about their owners.
The free tote bag you get with your trial subscription to the New Yorker means you’re a pseudo-intellectual. A hefty, industrial outdoors backpack means you discovered rock climbing two years ago and now it’s your life. A “cute” backpack shaped like a cat or a dragon or something means you like to shop on AliExpress. A transparent backpack means you really, really want to get robbed. A navy blue Jansport backpack means you have no personality. 
So, what does your bag say about you?

New athletic director Mike Bohn is officially on the clock, and that’s bad news for head football coach Clay Helton. Unless the first quarter of the Arizona State game was the only USC football Bohn has ever seen — in that case, brace yourself for a five-year extension. 
Since the BYU loss, fans have speculated over USC’s next head coaching hire. Most are clamoring for Urban Meyer to ride in on his white horse, win a few national championships and retreat to CBS Sports when things inevitably go south. This would give him the coveted three rings at three different schools and three retirements at three different broadcast networks (college football’s version of the EGOT). 
Others wanted Bohn to roll the dice and row the boat by hiring Minnesota’s P.J. Fleck, who at the very least would turn stale press conferences into Disney Plus-level premium content (though it has been nice being able to copy and paste Helton’s phrases from week to week). But any chance of that ended when Fleck signed a contract extension last week that will keep him in the Twin Cities through 2026.
A lot is up in the air, but one thing is certain: No one knows anything yet, and it’s causing the fanbase to lose its collective mind. 
The other day, I was scouring Twitter for any new information on the head coaching search, and I came across this gem from a USC fan, in response to beat writer Alica de Artola, who was trying to curtail fan expectations. 
“But Alicia, USC was THIS CLOSE to digging up the remains of Howard Jones, re-animating him and surrounding him with a staff from the SEC West,” tweets user kingcambie. “It was going to happen!” 
Special thanks to the king of cambie for inspiring me to come up with this list of the most unlikely candidates to replace Helton. I can’t tell you who USC will hire, but perhaps ruling out a few names will end those recurring nightmares of Jeff Fisher leading the team out of the Coliseum tunnel. Here we go. 
Florida Atlantic head coach Lane Kiffin
Every time my dad calls me, he asks me who I think USC’s next head coach will be. Every time, I tell him I don’t know. And every time he responds, “You’re bringing back Lane Kiffin.” 
First of all, Dad, if you already have the answer, then why are you asking me? And second of all, please stop. Florida Atlantic has put up a solid 23-13 record during Kiffin’s tenure, but he’s shown no signs of maturing from when he called for a 76-yard field goal as the Raiders’ head coach. He still tweets more than his own players and burns bridges at every stop. 
Let’s leave this idea on the tarmac once and for all. 
Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll 
Why’d he have to go, I don’t know, he wouldn’t say / Reggie did something [not even really] wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Unless quarterback Russell Wilson abruptly retires to be a stay-at-home dad or Amazon buys out the Seahawks and outsources their coaching to Bangladesh, this isn’t happening. But USC fans can keep dreaming. To cope, I usually watch the first hour of ESPN 30 for 30’s “Trojan War” and drift off to sleep before the NCAA intervenes. 
The only silver lining is that, at age 68, Carroll is youthful enough to coach into his mid-90s. Maybe he’ll come back around 2040, but don’t even count on that. 
LSU head coach Ed Orgeron 
USC had its chance to give Orgeron the keys to the program back in 2013 when he led the team to a 6-2 finish as interim head coach. During Orgeron’s run, which included an upset over No. 4 Stanford, then-athletic director Pat Haden said, “I had 136 pro-Coach O emails today. Those were just emails. That doesn’t count the tweets, letters and phone calls. In my day, they sent ‘em by carrier pigeon. Now, I get ‘em four or five ways.”
And yet he ignored all of those messages — through all four or five ways they were delivered — and hired Steve Sarkisian, who, um, wasn’t really head coach material. Now Orgeron is the head coach of LSU, a job the Louisiana-born part-man-mostly-alligator was put on this earth to do. Since taking over, the Tigers have gone 28-7 and just took down No. 2 Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium over the weekend. I’d be more upset about it, but it’s hard to argue with destiny. Orgeron will be coaching the Tiguhs until the bayou dries up and Haden’s decision remains one of USC’s worst in recent history, which says a lot. 
Former Rams coach Jeff Fisher 
Just no. The last season Fisher led a team at the Coliseum, it finished 4-12 even though that same team had enough talent to make the Super Bowl two years later. Fisher can rest easy knowing he’ll forever go down in history … as the losingest coach in NFL history (tied with Dan Reeves at 165 losses). Fisher will be name-dropped in every USC head coaching search until the end of time, all because he played for the Trojans in the early 1980s (The Trojan Family is real! Fight On!). At least it’s impossible to go 7-9 in college football, if USC does somehow end up with Fisher. 
The John McKay statue outside of the John McKay Center 
Honestly, why not? He’s a steady presence. He has the most wins in USC history (127). He understands the program by virtue of constantly lingering around. Give the man his job back.

For some, music is simply a career choice, but for others, it is a part of who they are as unique individuals. 
Cordelia Degher, a freshman majoring in popular music, hit the “American Idol” stage in 2017 when she was asked by one of the producers of the show to join one of their private showcases before eventually being sent to the next round on the show. The experience was surreal, Degher reminisced.
Degher was only 5 years old when she started singing and recorded her first song when she was just 10. Growing up in a musical household made it easy for Degher to experiment with music and learn all that comes with a career in the industry.
“I don’t even think I would be doing music at all if it weren’t for [my dad and sister]; I was kind of like, ‘Let’s do it.’ And all of a sudden, I was just writing songs, too, and I don’t even remember it happening,” Degher said.
Darius Degher, Cordelia’s father and mentor, has been a musician his whole life. Darius, a singer and songwriter, gave Cordelia the foundation for her music career to begin and produces all of her songs with her.
“I’m involved, I produce her recordings and I’ve advised her for almost her whole life just because it’s kind of an organic part of our family to love music,” Darius said. “I recommend the girls how to go about doing things and such, you know. But on the other hand, I’m not a stage parent kind of person. I don’t fuel up at her gigs and say, ‘Do it like that.’ She’s her own artist.”
When it comes to careers in music, it is important for a rising artist to receive the appropriate guidance on how to start but also how to make it far.
“I’ve always been honest with [both sisters],” Darius said. “I haven’t had any kind of grand success [in the music industry], yet I’ve been making records for my whole life, so I’ve been honest with them about that, and in a way, I haven’t really encouraged her very much, or her sister … for the most part, I have told the girls, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s a really terrible business, and your chances of success are very low. And even if you are successful, are you sure you want it?”
Cordelia doesn’t tie her music to a singular genre and draws inspiration from diverse popular artists and styles of music in the industry. However, she described the sound of one of her songs as “dream pop,” although when she performs live she characterizes her guitar-playing as “folk-inspired” and vocals as R&B and contemporary.
“My biggest influences, not that I necessarily sound like them, but my biggest musical influences I would say are Lana Del Rey and Frank Ocean,” Degher said. “Those are like two of my favorite artists that I really am excited by.”
Gracie Hurley, a sophomore at Mira Costa College in San Diego, has had a close relationship  with Cordelia since their sophomore year of high school. Ever since she met Cordelia, she’s known of the singer-songwriter’s passion for music, and Hurley has since supported her unique sound.
“She has one of the most beautiful voices I’ve ever heard, and she writes amazing songs and I like it because she’s not trying to sound like anyone else,” Hurley said. “She definitely gets inspired by people, but she has her own really unique voice and sound, and so I love that about her and I think a lot of other people love that too.”
Since she started writing and making music when she was very young, her style of music has gone through various phrases as she evolved as an artist. Her EP “Open Up to Me” and single “Goodbye Song,” which came out in 2013, are samples of music that represented who she was during those years.
“I just think growing up, my sound has just matured over the years,” Degher said. “When I was a freshman in high school, I think, ‘Open Up to Me’ came out, and ‘Goodbye Song’ when I was in eighth grade, so I was just younger at that time and I didn’t really know what my sound was or my style.”
Cordelia said she hopes to continue sharing her music at future shows around Southern California and said she’s excited for her new journey.
“I mean, honestly, this is what I’ve wanted to do since I can remember — I’ve never really thought of wanting to do anything else,” Cordelia said. “I couldn’t really imagine it and now being at USC for this is like taking another step in my journey.”

The School of Dramatic Arts finished its run of its most recent production “The Cider House Rules Part One: Here in St. Cloud’s” and “The Cider House Rules Part 2: In Other Parts of the World” Sunday.
The story, which spans from the 1880s to the 1950s, details the life of the orphan Homer Wells (played by Tim Frangos, a junior double majoring in theatre and law, history and culture), who spends the majority of his childhood and early adolescence at an orphanage in St. Clouds, Maine. 
The first part of the play follows Wells’ relationship with Dr. Wilbur Larch, the orphanage’s director and physician, who is played by Shrey Bhargava, a senior majoring in theatre and cinema and media studies. While shadowing Dr. Larch, Wells discovers his talents and abilities in the medical field. Dr. Larch, who performs secret abortions, encourages Homer to pursue a medical career, but Homer is preoccupied with searching for a home of his own outside the orphanage. 
Ultimately, Homer is adopted by Candy (Alexandra Punch, a sophomore majoring in theatre) and her boyfriend Wally (Nicholas Petroccione, a senior majoring in theatre) after they come in seeking an abortion. Homer is faced with the difficult choice between leaving behind the people who have become his family during his adolescence and pursuing a new life full of hope and promise. 
The second half picks up immediately where the first leaves off, following Wells and the rest of the cast throughout the next 15 years of their lives. Homer and Candy fall in love and — after believing Wally was shot down piloting in a plane in Burma — conceive a child together. When they learn Wally has been found alive, they choose to raise the baby separately and claim their son was adopted. By the end of the play, after Dr. Larch has died, Homer ultimately decides that it is his duty to carry out his practice of abortions, giving patients the freedom to choose the destiny of their own lives. 
The actors’ performances were captivating and cathartic. Most students portrayed characters much older than themselves and, because the story spanned several decades, were tasked with the challenge of maturing right in front of the audience’s eyes. Dr. Larch begins as a young man (presumably in his late 30s to early 40s) and by the shows’ end is somewhere in his 90s. 
Bhargava is not only able to portray this emotionally by letting the audience in on the hardships that have weighed down his character over time, he is also able to mimic the aging process in his physicality. With his movement slowed and posture dropped over time, the audience can forget that this is a young man portraying an older one. This production was given the same rehearsal time as any other SDA show, yet was tasked with putting on two productions — and the result being a testament to the hard work and determination of the students. 
The play’s heavy themes and topics only further add to the depth and vulnerability the actors displayed. Abortion, rape, abuse, love and loss permeate the work. In one instance, the character Rose Rose (played by Winona Weber, a sophomore majoring in acting), a 14-year-old girl who is abused and raped by her father, is learning to ride a bike, falls off and injures herself. Though she hurts herself, she admits it was not enough and that she was trying to hurt the baby she was carrying. Weber’s performance matched innocence with wisdom and maturity — we see a young girl who is faced with the problems of adult life all too soon. 
Rose Rose falls for Angel Wells, Homer and Candy’s son, in the second part, but knows that her father will continue to abuse her if she stays in town. And although staying with Angel may be the optimal choice, and it may be what the heart desires, she knows that it is ultimately better to run away and save herself from her father’s manipulation. 
Through all the wonderful work of the cast and crew, the play leaves the audience asking themselves whether it’s better to be right or to be good. Do we follow the rules that have been set for us by both ourselves and others because we think it is a good thing to do? Or do we break those rules and follow our guts, doing what we believe is right for our own well-being? 
Overall, the production brought aspects of humor and poignancy to the USC stage and allowed for the students to creatively explore a rich and invigorating text.

It was the afternoon of a summer day in Hong Kong, and I was on my way back to my hotel. My taxi driver, after reluctantly accepting me on the street, rocketed down the road in hopes of beating the traffic before his shift ended. Tumbling around in the backseat as we neared the final destination, the echoes of people shouting began to radiate into the car. 
Quickly becoming aware of what was happening, I pulled my camera out and snapped some photos of a sea of protestors outside my window before my driver sped through the green light. Realizing I had just witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I was both in awe and ready to discuss what had happened with people at home who had witnessed the same event through their TV screens.
Fast forward to this semester: It’s been almost five months since the protests started, and I’m presenting an article from The New York Times about the riots and unrest in one of my classes. Although I picked this article for its more lighthearted tone — with the author quoting Hong Kong protestors using anonymous quirky nicknames like “Fat Boy” — I thought I was sharing an issue everyone was familiar with. As the class came to an end, my professor thanked me for choosing the topic, telling me that it was the first time he truly understood the situation in Hong Kong.
This wasn’t the first time I had engaged in a conversation with someone who wasn’t fully aware of the protests. Whether it’s correcting a factually incorrect political meme a friend texted me or having lengthy class discussions with my peers, I’ve known that this issue is difficult to comprehend, specifically why Hong Kong is fighting and is still continuing to do so today. 
Upon being returned to China in 1997 after 156 years of British control, Hong Kong was designated a special administrative region of China and was promised a high degree of autonomy, retention of its legislative system and its people’s rights and freedoms for 50 years. However, demonstrations and protests started brewing after an extradition law was proposed that would have allowed the transfer of criminal fugitives to mainland China. With the possibility that Hong Kong residents and visitors would be subjected to the legal system of China, the citizens protested the bill until it was declared “dead,” and now, young adults are leading the charge in fighting to maintain the region’s democracy and civil liberties.
Although the matter is complex, I expected people to know the intricacies of the issue, especially given how much it is being covered. It’s not like the problem is being censored and hidden; there are plenty of publications broadcasting everything from daily updates to long feature pieces. 
At USC, and in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, especially — where the news is at the forefront of everyone’s minds —  staying on top of global issues like this is the status quo. Given how this issue impacts young adults, it’s upsetting that people fail to understand the gravity of it.
Before continuing, it’s important that I discuss why this topic is so important to me. My visit to Hong Kong wasn’t a spur of the moment trip; I wanted to explore my family roots. My father was born in Hong Kong, and he lived there before immigrating to the United States. The place had been a mysterious spectacle for me, and traveling there only piqued my interest in understanding Hong Kong.
Even though I have a stronger tie to this issue than most Americans, I find it disgraceful that people are not aware of key details of Hong Kong’s struggles. The Hong Kong protests make up a global issue that everyone needs to focus on. The problems may seem far away from home, but they highlight important values we cherish in the U.S. such as civil rights, democracy and freedom. 
These issues can impact the fate of our world, and this applies to other political disputes too. The Hong Kong protests should receive the same attention as issues relevant to us in the states such as gun control, the upcoming elections and global issues such as climate change.
I’m not here to criticize anyone individually, say that anyone is at fault for not being a news junkie or ridicule someone for not having an opinion on this issue. However, this trend of not understanding the protests, after tensions have been continuing for five months, is unacceptable. 
Don’t let the Hong Kong protests become a forgotten statistic.

Nissans’s slogan, “Innovation that excites” takes on new meanings with the gadgets of today’s digital age, including but not limited to: wireless earbuds that broke internet meme culture, virtual notepads that substitute classic paper and pencil while combating rapid deforestation, smartphones that ignite controversy with headphone jack deficits and trypophobia-triggering cameras. 
These battery-powered assets seem so innate at times, with our thumbs perpetually texting, our ears constantly clogged and our eyes relentlessly focusing on our pixelated screens. In our generation, this obsessive tendency has seeped into every aspect of our daily routines, whether it’s sitting in a 9 a.m. lecture, eating in the dining hall or strutting down Trousdale. Or, perhaps, biking and skateboarding down Trousdale Parkway. 
Texting while riding plagues USC’s campus like a viral internet challenge, where students sporadically blind themselves from their surroundings while gripping a single handlebar. On a campus as densely populated as USC, texting while riding is especially concerning considering the heavy traffic flow in specific parts of campus. In fact, due to an increase in on-campus collisions since last year, DPS implemented the Hahn Plaza bike ban earlier this semester. 
While the current bike ban addresses traffic congestion on campus, it neglects distracted riding as a contributing factor. To diminish this safety hazard and toxic mannerism, USC should further extend the Hahn Plaza bike ban by prohibiting the use of cell phones on motorized scooters, skateboards and bicycles alike. 
Students should take it further, though — instead of treating it as an obstacle, we should embrace this prohibition as a reinforcement mechanism and an opportunity to momentarily disconnect from technology. 
Distracted biking has gained widespread attention in major cities in light of the distracted driving epidemic over the past decade. In an observational study conducted in Boston in 2016, around one-third of observed bikers exhibited distracted behavior, which included having earbuds in ears and electronic objects in hand. Because of the prevalence of this behavior, cities such as Chicago, Philadelphia and Austin have passed laws prohibiting bicyclists from using cell phones or texting, with many others still working to gain legislative traction that will hopefully enact such prohibitions. 
On college campuses especially, students seem to ignore the research that stresses the embedded hazards in operating vehicles with divided attention — such as the increased likelihood of collisions and missing stop lights and signs — simply because biking and skating aren’t the same as driving a car. Still, texting while biking is analogous to texting while driving because it puts both the driver and the people in the surrounding environment at risk. 
In addition to the safety concerns prompted by texting while biking, this habit highlights phone addiction as a harmful facet of this generation. Today, college students downplay obsessive cell phone use to such an extent that its effects on mental health are normalized and blatantly dismissed. Yet, numerous studies suggest a strong association between high cell phone usage and sleep deprivation, anxiety and depression, as well as poor social skills. With rates of depression rising by nearly 63% for teens and 47% for millennials between 2013 and 2016, cell phones could be the culprit. 
However, this refusal to put our phones down for an objective safety hazard perpetually disregards mental well-being as being less important than scrolling through an Instagram feed on a three-minute bike ride to class. Although cell phones are certainly not the only factor for worsening mental health, students must acknowledge their impact to understand that texting while biking is not a matter of learning how to multitask better. Conversely, it emblemizes this robotic, disconnected generation, complete with people willing to put themselves and others at risk because of a cell phone dependency.  
Going forward, instead of maintaining the same detrimental habits, students should embrace a prohibition on texting while biking. With this kind of reinforcement, students could take a step toward fostering a safer environment and perhaps toward lifting the culture of cell phone dependency on campus at large. 
It could be an opportunity to soak in our surroundings and ground ourselves in these volatile and spiraling times. It could be a new medium for resonating with the unfamiliar and unlatching from the unhealthy comfort of technology. 
It could even inhibit this digital age from becoming even more of a digital nightmare.

Workers represented by UNITE HERE  Local 11, a local union, criticized USC for cutting hours during the holiday season and insufficient pay despite increased costs of living in Los Angeles during the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. 
USC Hospitality employee Miriam Sieger, who has worked at the University since 1974, became emotional during her testimony on the struggles of working at USC. 
“I’ve never seen a management like the one we have right now cutting hours around this time of the year,” Sieger said. “I give my whole life, my loyalty to USC.” 
The workers, who are some of the 15,700 staff members at USC, also expressed admiration for the unanimous passage of a resolution on student support of new contract negotiations by the Senate. Korina Torres, who works at Seeds Marketplace, called on student leaders to use their voice to help workers during the negotiation process. 
“Living in L.A. is very expensive; times are very hard,” Torres said. “It’s Christmas next month, and they are cutting our hours. We are just seeking help, we are trying to let people know as to where we are coming from and any help would go a long way.” 
Rene Muñoz, a staff member who grew up near the University Park Campus, said he struggles to afford the city’s cost of living on his current salary and benefits. 
“I’ve been working here 20 years, and I’m now working only 34 hours and that’s not enough to pay my rent,” Muñoz said. “I got kids.”
Speaker of the Senate Emily Donahue said she was moved by the experiences of the workers. 
“You’ve made such an impact on all of our lives and you deserve to be treated with the respect and dignity,” Donahue said at the meeting. “It is honestly an atrocity that the University treats people who are so integral to our daily lives like this. I promise you that we all will be advocates for actual change.”  
The Senate also passed revisions to the elections code for 2020. The proposed elections code was presented by the elections and recruitment team at last week’s meeting. 
Senators debated allowing USG members to participate on campaign teams during elections ultimately deciding to restrict the practice due to conflicts of interests. 
“During elections, USG members have a responsibility to campus and the organization,” director of elections and recruitment Vaanyari Goel said during the meeting. “When they’re wearing those white USG election t-shirts, they are the neutral body.” 
Senators also differed on allowing USG members to give advice to candidates. 
Sen. Randi Anderson said she would not like to remain neutral during elections, wishing to support candidates who would support the needs of the black community on campus 
“As a Black woman, I don’t want to be neutral and I want my voice to be heard, so if somebody that is trying to run for Senate is running I want to say I support that person because I know they are trying to work for what I need,” Anderson said. “The Black population is such an underrepresented population already, so me as a person, I should be able to state that is who I want.” 
During the meeting, the Senate also passed a resolution on extending the freshman forgiveness program, which allows first years to retake up to three classes in which they received a grade of D+ or below, to transfer students. The resolution aimed to ease the transition for transfer students, who often experience a decline in GPA when acclimating to a new academic environment.

While Randall Park was attending UCLA, he started a theatre company on campus. His parents originally approved of this because they believed it was “for fun.” However, when Park formed another theatre group after he graduated, his parents were not as open to the idea of him pursuing acting.
“My mom actually worked at UCLA … and she would hear first-hand stories about how hard it was,” Park said. “And she would tell me, especially as an Asian person, how impossible it would be. And she was right, it was really hard. I say my parents didn’t support my career, but with the perspective I have now, they really supported me during my pursuit of this career because they housed me, they fed me sometimes and maybe did my laundry here and there.” 
Nearly 500 people attended the “Fresh Off the Boat” actor’s conversation on Asian American identity and the film industry in the Tutor Campus Center Ballroom Tuesday. Park, who also starred in the 2019 Netflix film “Always Be My Maybe,” is the final speaker to come to campus as a part of the International Student Assembly’s Global Cultural Month. USC Speakers Committee co-hosted the event.
“We went six seasons — it’s very hard for a show to go six seasons,” Park said. “To have an Asian family on TV on a show that lasts that long … it shows the industry that there’s good business in telling these stories… The success of our show proves to the industry, and not just our show — and a lot of shows with people of color as leads — shows the industry that these shows can be watched by everybody and celebrated by everybody.”
Shwetha Ganesh, assistant director of the Speakers Committee, and Nathan Cho, an intern at ISA, moderated the event. 
“I volunteered myself … [because] this is such a cool opportunity to talk to someone who’s so well-known and established in this field,” said Ganesh, a sophomore majoring in international relations and the global economy. “Why wouldn’t you take this opportunity to get to know someone like that and be the one to facilitate the conversation to your peers?” 
Park discussed meeting comedian and actress Ali Wong, who co-wrote and starred alongside Park in “Always Be My Maybe,” over cranberry-fried rice during one of the theater company parties. The two became immediate friends and remained in touch throughout each other’s careers. 
“Ali and I are old friends, we’ve known each other for a very long time, I used to do standup, and we used to do it together,” he said. “We would talk about projects we wanted to work on and collaborate on little things and we’d always said we would want to maybe one day make a movie together; we both loved Rom-Coms… We were like, ‘why don’t we just write? We know there’s a demand for this story.’ So we just sat down, met every week and banged out a script.” 
Though Park has found commercial success, he said he started his career making his own web series before working with the independent digital production company Wong Fu Productions in its web shorts on YouTube. 
“It was a great period for me because I got to write, I got to act, I got to play really anything I wanted to,” Park said. “And that really informed [about] what I wanted to make out of this career. I want to be able to play the romantic lead, I want to play the villain, I want to play everything. And I got to do that while we were making these shorts.” 
Park earned his masters in Asian American studies at UCLA, and during his time in college, he co-foundedLapu the Coyote that Cares, a theatre company that was carried on post-graduation. 
Park said that with more shows and movies, the presence of Asian Americans in the media will continue to become normalized. 
“The roles he has played was a big part of [why ISA chose him],” said Jinah Hur, director of the International Student Assembly and a junior majoring in philosophy and psychology. “One of the main roles he’s known for is ‘Fresh Off The Boat,’ where he plays the immigrant father, so we definitely felt that he kind of has an understanding of the immigrant experience, or he had to in order to take over that role.”
Despite criticisms of “Fresh Off the Boat” being a show that enforces Asian American stereotypes, Park said the show has been able to add complexity to the seemingly archetypal characters.  
“Personally, I don’t look at a show like ‘Fresh Off The Boat’ as being stereotypical; and I know that there are aspects, you can argue that there are aspects that are stereotypical but … we show so much more than that, like yeah [Jessica] is a strict mom, but she also loves her kids so much,” Park said. “So I think what’s most important is that whatever projects we continue to create, we just show people as human beings, like the whole scope of it, and not think too much of ‘oh is this going to be seen as stereotypical’ — if it’s truthful, put it in.”
Steven Mach, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that Park’s success motivates him to disprove the Asian stereotype. 
“[The talk] definitely makes me feel like I shouldn’t be afraid to step out of my boundaries,” Mach said. “I feel like I know him through his films a little bit, but seeing what he’s done really impacts the way we see ourselves as Asians. We can do more than what other people perceive us as.”

Michael Cesar and Rhys Richmond were in a civil engineering class focused on the refugee crisis when they thought of Duet, a website dedicated to creating an easier way to provide aid for refugee populations.
Cesar, an alumnus who majored in international relations and business administration, and Richmond, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, wanted to help local populations receive direct support. Duet allows anyone to purchase and donate items such as electronics, toys, clothing, hygiene products and other necessities to resettled refugees.
“You would go to our website, you would go on to one of our families’ pages,” Cesar said. “On that page, you’ll see the name of the family, their photo, a little bit of a blurb about who they are, what they like, what their dreams are, what their favorite sports are, and then underneath that blurb, you’ll see the items they need.”
The company was launched in 2018 with the mission of eliminating inefficiencies in the current system of providing aid to these refugees by connecting donors directly with refugee populations around the world. Duet, with a core team of seven members, has helped 15 families by supplying over $5,000 in aid.
“You would select any of those items, put them in a basket and then pay, and then as soon as you pay, you’ll get a confirmation email that the money is being transferred to the stores,” Cesar said.
As of today, operations have mostly been conducted in Greece, the main entry point for refugees fleeing the Middle East and North Africa into Europe. Looking forward, Duet plans to continue to add features to the app and expand to other countries with significant refugee populations. 
Spencer Petty, a senior majoring in journalism and the head of marketing for Duet, first heard about the organization from Cesar. 
“My brother was friends with a family of refugees in Nashville, where I’m from, and he helped them do things like get health insurance, etc … I was kind of exposed to the obstacles that they face when they’re trying to resettle,” Petty said. “It is really cool to pause and take a look back and look at these families who we have really, like — we have changed their lives immensely.”
Cesar believes that Duet stands out because the platform is able to empower refugees by giving them the autonomy to request exactly what they need and communicate with donors. He also said the company contributes to eliminating stigma surrounding resettled families in local communities.
Both founders credit the class, Innovation in Engineering Design for Global Challenges, for bringing them together and helping them to brainstorm an idea for real-world policy solutions. The class made it possible for both students to travel to Greece.
“Not only did [the class] take us there to begin with, but we have four very, very important mentors and professors that we got out of the class as well, and those four have been kind of instrumental in our success,” Cesar said. “Short term, our goals are sort of as simple as we’re just trying to grow. You know, we want to drive as many people to the site as possible just so we can provide more items to our partner families.”  
For donors, contributing through Duet is also a rewarding experience, as it connects refugees and donors in a personal way. 
Sarah Danson, an alumna who majored in business administration and public policy, recently donated a pair of sweatpants to a family and received a message from the family. 
“One of my good friends Michael, has been really, really passionate about and signed up for that class to help come up with different solutions to the refugee crisis in Greece,” Danson said. “I think what’s cool about their approach is that it’s a really easy way to feel like you have an impact.” 
Cesar said in the process of creating and launching the site, he learned about the importance of the refugee crisis and how a small contribution to struggling families is meaningful.
“What we’ve learned is the deep resilience of people that we’ve seen in our refugee families and how actually they only need a little bit of help to really realize their potential, and they have a lot of potential,” Cesar said.

More than 100 USC students, faculty and staff gathered for a mass at Our Savior Parish Tuesday evening to honor the life of John Lynch. 
Lynch, a senior majoring in screenwriting in the School of Cinematic Arts, died Friday.
The service opened with several hymns and prayers from members of the community. Nick Solari, president of the student executive board at the Catholic Center, welcomed all attendees to the parish and told students that the center was a safe place. 
“In times like these, I think it’s sometimes hard to find the right words. A lot of us remember getting here just a few weeks ago,” Solari said. “Each and every one of you, no matter how you’re processing this loss, no matter where you are, what stage of life or what kind of tradition you come from. You are welcome here.”
Solari also asked attendees to make a promise of love saying that Lynch would have wanted them to do that. He said he wanted students to honor Lynch by continuing with their work. 
The prayer ceremony was followed by words from Varun Soni, dean of the Office of Religious Life. During his speech, Soni said Lynch’s family wanted him to convey how grateful they were for everyone’s love and friendship. 
Soni also thanked SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley, who was in attendance. He then asked the community to observe a minute of silence. 
Soni talked about Lynch, who came to him with a few of his friends to talk about “life’s big questions.” Soni said Lynch was very communicative about his love for his friends and family. 
“I was amazed at how he was communicating his love to his friends, in a way that very few young men are capable of doing,” Soni said. “He was his usual honest self, but this time, he talked at length about how much his friends meant and how much he loved them.”
Soni said Lynch had a big reputation around campus and was known as someone who made everyone smile. He called Lynch a contemporary version of his hero Jay Gatsby and said that while he expected him to be like a “superhero” the first time he met him, he soon realized he was much more. 
“John Lynch was our flame, our light, our star, who burned so brightly while he was with us, we needed sunglasses just to be around him,” Soni said. “In an age of copycats and imitators, John was truly an American original.”
Soni mentioned Lynch’s work as an administrator of the meme page and said he was more honest than any other student he had met in his two decades of teaching. It was Lynch’s honesty, he said, that allowed him to turn his pain into everyone else’s joy. 
“Especially in an age when so many of us wear so many masks, both online and off,” Soni said. “John was also honest about his pain, which he turned into joy for others. That’s why he did the meme site. That’s why he did stand up comedy to bring joy to others.”
Soni read from a Daily Trojan profile on Lynch, saying that the last paragraph captured the mood Lynch had been in the last time they met.
“I’ve had a great life overall. I would never change anything that’s happened to me. I’m very grateful. I have so many great people who love me. I love USC. I love the world. I have so much love for everything,” Lynch told the Daily Trojan in November 2018.
Soni then asked the community to be there for each other and remember that they are a family who supported everybody. 
“Please know that over the weeks and months and years ahead, you will have each other,” he said. “You are a family. You care deeply for each other. You advocate for each other, you support each other. You tell stories together, you love each other.” 
Soni then invited everyone in attendance to gather in the courtyard and fill out the memorial books with their prayers, stories and wishes for the family. 
The SCA community also gathered on Monday to share stories and memories of Lynch followed by a reception in his honor held by the school’s John Wells Division of Writing for Screen and Television division.  
“Last time I saw John he gave me a hug and he thanked me,” Soni said. “After he left, I realized that he had it backward. That I should have thanked him instead. For his bravery, for his humor, for his honesty, for his pain and for his love and for courageously modeling all his strengths and vulnerabilities at a time when we need that example most in the world.”

In a letter sent to students Tuesday night, several administrators informed students about the dangers of opioid use and announced the addition of a Department of Psychiatry at the Engemann Student Health Center.
The letter — signed by Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp, Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman and Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas — comes one day after a student was found dead off-campus Monday. 
“These losses have shaken our community and our sympathy goes out to the families and friends who are mourning loved ones,” they wrote about the now nine students who have died this semester.
On Sunday, Van Orman told the Daily Trojan the University is “concerned” that at least one death may be linked to an opioid overdose. Three deaths have been confirmed as suicides, and the other six are under investigation.
“What we need to be doing a better job with on our campus is increasing access to mental health services and education about the risks of opioid use, in particular fentanyl,” she said Sunday. “The challenge for us is there’s several weeks between when a death might occur and we have confirmation, but the risk is so high so we are making people aware. We know that in our community, it’s a risk.”
In Tuesday’s letter, Van Orman, Crisp and Thomas wrote that mixing alcohol with these drugs can be fatal.
“In addition to the direct effects of each substance, drugs shared for recreational use can be mixed with other substances to increase its effects, sometimes without a user’s knowledge,” they wrote. “This practice is rising and is linked to overdose and death.”
The letter also emphasized the University’s commitment to increasing mental health resources on campus and that the number of mental health counselors has increased by nearly 50%.
“We are committed to providing counseling services to those of you in need,” they wrote, adding that a psychiatry department will be added Monday to Engemann for ongoing mental health needs.
“Our doors are open. Let’s continue talking and sharing because it’s crucial that we stay connected,” they ended the letter.
On Wednesday night, the Undergraduate Student Government will host a community event exclusively for students to speak about prioritizing well-being, on-campus wellness resources and to “discuss how to work through all of this as a student community.”
Students dealing with mental health concerns can walk into USC Student Health centers or contact the 24/7 phone line (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance. Faculty and staff members can reach out to the Center for Work and Family Life at (213) 821-0800. Students, faculty and staff members concerned about a fellow Trojan can notify Trojans Care 4 Trojans online or by calling (213) 821-4710.
If students witness an overdose, call 911 or alert DPS at (213) 740-4321 on the University Park Campus or (323) 442-1000 on the Health Sciences Campus.
