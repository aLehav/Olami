With Arizona and USC both coming off losses last weekend, Saturday’s match-up at the Coliseum will be a battle to get back on track as we enter week five of the college football season. This week’s magic number is four.
The Wildcats will arrive in Los Angeles with one of the steadiest, most experienced quarterbacks in the country under center. Senior Nick Foles, a three year starter, is ranked fourth nationally in passing yards with 1490 through the first four games. He is also 4th nationally in passing yards/game with nearly 375 per contest. Foles also leads the Pac-12 in both of those categories.
With all the success the Arizona aerial attack has experienced, the run game has been quite a different story for the Wildcats. Arizona running backs have accumulated just 249 yards on the ground. That total ranks 4th to last nationally, and dead last among teams that have played 4 games. If Arizona is to come out of Los Angeles with a victory, some sort of run game will have to emerge. USC’s secondary struggled against Arizona State, but an effective running game helped open up opportunities. Make no mistake, Nick Foles is a very solid quarterback (10 TD to 0 INT in 2011) but USC can focus on its pass coverage with him if running backs Keola Antolin and Ka’Deem Carey fail to get anything going.
To make things worse for the Wildcats, this is the team’s 4th consecutive game against a team that has been ranked in the AP Top 25 so far this year. Arizona did not fare well in its previous three contests, falling to No. 9 Oklahoma State, No. 6 Stanford, and No. 10 Oregon by a combined 77 points. The key to victory for USC will be stopping the pass. If the Trojans can limit the production of Foles, it could spell doom for Arizona for the fourth week in a row.

Posting birthday gifts on Twitter might be the next big fad. To wish Lil’ Wayne a happy 29th birthday — which the artist celebrated Sept. 27 — Justin Bieber tweeted his own version of the rapper’s “How to Love.”
Posted during the insomniac hours of Wednesday morning, the tweet read, “Trying to sleep. until then happy birthday @LilTunechi – #remix,” and included a link to the remix on Youtube.
When compared to the rest of Lil’ Wayne’s catalog, “How to Love,” released this past summer, is significantly different. It shocked people, but in a positive way.
The ballad is a simple acoustic guitar and drum beat track that has minimal auto-tune, a major style change for Lil’ Wayne.
Bieber is not the first artist to cover the laid-back track though. Demi Lovato recently performed her own cover for VHI and others remixed the original, but Bieber’s version wins in the creativity department.
Although Bieber’s rendition is quite similar to the original, he put a spin on it by producing and playing each part live, according to his manager.
The addition of harmonies and another guitar part is a nice touch to create more dimension within the already soulful song. Bieber also snuck in a short rap verse of his own.
Although it is great to hear the ballad sung by pop singers and Lil’ Wayne is nowhere near being a professional vocalist, his original has a rawness that could only be achieved by the man who wrote it.

When Portugal. The Man found out that its trailer, van and $100,000 worth of equipment had been stolen at Chicago’s Lollapalooza early August, the four band members did what anyone would do in this modern age: They tweeted about it.
The word traveled fast. Portugal. The Man became a trending topic on Twitter, and soon, both the local news and police joined them on the scene.
“The social media — the whole internet scene — is what saved our butts,” said Jason Sechrist, Portugal. The Man’s drummer. “Instead of just us and our fan base, it got to friends of friends of friends. It got everywhere.”
After days of tips and police investigation, most of the band’s gears were recovered in the home of a man who claimed he had bought them at a flea market.
This stroke of bad luck shook things up for the four members, who in just three-and-a-half weeks were embarking on a world tour for their sixth studio album, In the Mountain In the Cloud.
Rehearsals were inevitably pushed back and new equipment had to be acquired, but in the time allotted, the foursome worked harder than ever, Sechrist said.
“We just kind of hit rehearsal really hard,” he said. “But now we’re pretty damn tight. We’re tighter than we were when we played Lollapalooza, so that’s good.”
And with that, the psychedelic-rock band hailing from Alaska dove right back into the groove. After kicking off the American leg of its tour in Santa Clara just recently, Portugal. The Man will grace The Avalon in Hollywood this Saturday with their signature psychedelic-rock jams.
Saturday’s sold-out show will not be the last of its kind on this tour, Sechrist said.
“It looks like a lot of the gigs will be sold out on the tour,” he said. “We brought in a new light show, new equipment with different sound effects, so people aren’t gonna hear the same things that they heard from us last year.”
In the Mountain In the Cloud, released July 19, may be the group’s sixth album since 2006, but it is also the band’s first release since signing with Atlantic Records last April. Naturally, it was also one of the most intimidating records to date, Sechrist said.
“We got really psyched out about all the other Atlantic Records releases over the course of many years, and we lost it in the beginning stretch, which is typically not the situation,” he said.
Adding on to that was the pressure of playing in big, expensive studios all across the country from Seattle to Texas to Los Angeles, as opposed to the more modest ones in the band’s earlier days, Sechrist said.
“We didn’t want to waste time and money because coming from the indie side, we were more able to play around and find our groove,” he said.
After months of traveling and touring around “with ideas,” Portugal. The Man’s foursome—John Gourley as lead vocals and guitar, Zachary Scott Carothers on bass, Ryan Neighbors on keyboards and Sechrist on drums—was able to sift its indie nature from the major record fuss and finish the record within a year, Sechrist said.
The most notable indication of the group’s indie roots is their humble openness with its fan base. In the months leading up to the official release of In the Mountain In the Cloud, the band released 30-second previews of some of their new tracks on YouTube.
“We’re not the type of band that’s mysterious and completely out of the picture for a year or two, and all of a sudden say, ‘here’s our new record, here’s our website, hope you like it, peace out,’” Sechrist said. “We’re pretty social guys, and we’re weird and fun.”
“Weird and fun” ranges anywhere from regularly sharing candid—and often ridiculous—photos of band members on Facebook to holding Skype “office hours” with fans and bloggers.
“In the beginning when MySpace was around, that really helped bands that were starting out,” Sechrist said. “We always try to take advantage of any great internet tool.”
Fitting that it was the best of these Internet tools that played a crucial role in the band’s miraculous tale of the lost-and-found gear.

1.) How will each team respond to adversity?
USC returns home after a disappointing result in Tempe, Ariz. The Trojans fell to the Sun Devils 43-22 and shot themselves in the foot by turning the ball over four times and squandering several scoring opportunities. USC coach Lane Kiffin commented Tuesday that the team looked more focus than they did last week. Meanwhile, Arizona is off to a 1-3 start as it concludes a brutal stretch of games. After rolling Northern Arizona in the opener, the Wildcats had to face No. 9 Oklahoma State, No. 6 Stanford and No. 10 Oregon.
2.) Can the Trojans finally win the turnover battle?
After the loss to Arizona State , Kiffin revealed that he offered the defense ice cream if they could force turnovers. The offer was to no avail, however. Through four games, the Trojans have yet to win the turnover battle in a contest. For the year, their turnover margin is minus-six. All signs point to USC losing the turnover battle yet again this weekend. Seniorquarterback Nick Foles has yet to throw an interception, and the Wildcats have only turned it over once in four games.
3.) Will Nick Foles carve up the USC secondary?
The senior quarterback is off to a solid start despite his team’s record. He has completed 129 of his 183 attempts (70.5 percent) for 1,447 yards. That mark is fourth best in the nation. Perhaps the most impressive part of Foles’s performance has been his ability to make smart throws. The third year starter has thrown 10 touchdowns without being intercepted this year. However, the offensive line has not done a spectacular job of blocking for him. Foles has been sacked 12 times so far. An effective pass rush from USC could help slow him down and throw off his rhythm.
4.) Is Arizona going to be able to establish a running game?
Out of 120 Football Bowl Subdivision teams, Arizona ranks No. 119 in rush yards per game with 62.3, though that may be a function of its system. Arizona has favored the pass in its play calling, throwing 189 times and running only 99 times. All four rushers who have touched the ball average over 4 yards per carry, and the Wildcats might try to run more after watching film of last week’s USC game. The Sun Devils opened up the passing game and spread out the Trojan’s defense to create holes for running back by striking a good run-pass balance.
