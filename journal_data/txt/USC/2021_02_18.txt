With the release of the new Godzilla v. Kong trailer, I felt like going back to watch giant monster films again. I had already watched tokusatsu (a japanese genre of film featuring superheroes and special effects) films and American giant monster films in general such as, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” and “Kong: Skull Island” so I decided to try something different.
There are plenty of movies dating back to the 1950s from both the Showa and Hesei Eras. However, with the news of “Shin Ultraman,” possibly being released in 2021 thanks to involvement of directors Shinji Higuchi and Hideaki Anno, I thought it would be nice to take a look at one of the more recent Godzilla spinoffs by the same directors — ”Shin Godzilla.””
“Shin Godzilla” was definitely one that stood out compared to other films in the franchise, but not for the reasons you might expect. 
For those who don’t know, “Shin Godzilla” was released in 2016 featuring the popular, destructive reptilian monster, Godzilla — with a twist. The film takes a more dark tone in regards to conveying its political satire and the morals that come with it. The legendary Godzilla series encompasses blockbuster action movies so Shin Godzilla and the Legendary series as a whole can’t really be compared with one another. However, through the horrific aspects of this different Godzilla, elements surrounding the narrative also have importance in expressing the dangers of both pollution and the consequences of not having all the facts. 
There is plenty to draw from the conflict of the human characters in the film. Most of the focus lies on the bureaucrats and scientists working in Japan to try and stop the giant lizard, created from nuclear waste mutation. Due to less of a focus on fight scenes, such as those found in “Godzilla” (2014), the movie is very dialogue heavy, involving many characters who can be forgotten or confused with one another. However, the focus on so many characters is supported by the helplessness of the situation as it contributes to a satire on how a government can react to something they are unfamiliar with along with the consequences of such a reaction. 
A lot of filtering is shown in the film, where information is passed rather slowly from point A to point B, to the point where the prime minister finds out what they assumed was wrong almost immediately after they decided to announce their conclusion. This in turn illustrates the parallels between the humans who have to adapt and avoid relying on assumptions in order to deal with this new crisis and Godzilla who adapts via his physical transformations in the film. 
The darker narrative also encompasses Godzilla’s mind and motivations, which are apparent in multiple films, both new and old. Despite Godzilla’s lifelessness in the majority of the film, Godzilla’s thoughts are expressed through the film’s soundtrack, specifically in the theme song, “Who Will Know.” 
The song describes how Godzilla is in constant agony from radiation and transformations, which are a result of its nuclear waste origin. The monster aligns with the destruction it causes as the lyrics state:
“I wear a void (As long as breath comes from my mouth) / Not even hope (I may yet stand the slightest chance) / A downward slope (A shaft of light is all I need) / Is all I see (To cease the darkness killing me).”
This horror continues to contribute in getting the characters to be proactive, as Godzilla, despite being in this pain, has a will to live that challenges the will of the government of Japan. 
The new task force for filling in the blanks regarding the creature get moments to shine, doing research themselves when perceived necessary. Rather than wait for the plot to show up on their doorstep, the audience is drawn as they work together against Godzilla with the task force during the film’s final confrontation by networking and taking advantage of what they already have at their disposal. 
“Shin Godzilla” is not a film I would recommend for younger audiences due to the mature political themes. However, older audiences can enjoy much including references found within the film, specifically with Godzilla, being based more from its original 1954 version than from other works. Of course, one of the cons is that in Shin Godzilla, the after effects of the destruction in regards to the civilian characters are overlooked in favor of the work of n the scientists and bureaucrats. 
Nevertheless, the film is able to incorporate a variety of elements while still staying true to the Godzilla franchise. Inspiration for the film was actually drawn from the Fukushima Natural Disaster and the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami and Earthquake whereas the original was a metaphor for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
Humanity creating this kaiju (a giant monster featured in japanese fiction) also poses some questions as to how future monsters will be introduced in the new sequels. The monsters so far have mainly been from nature itself, so the darker side of humanity’s influence on nature might be emphasized for making impactful kaiju villains. “Godzilla vs. Destroyah” (1995) has done this, a film indirectly referenced more than once in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” (2019). 
Overall “Shin Godzilla” does what it intended to — its a political satire with elements of horror surrounding it. The film is a gem in regards to appreciating different aspects and themes through darker tones despite the lack of action sequences. I still enjoy “Godzilla” (2014) despite the lack of action of course, and I do look forward to future installments of the Godzilla franchise and Toku in general that might take certain aspects from “Shin Godzilla.”

The first time freshman forward Evan Mobley noticed he was being double teamed on Wednesday night, he hit his brother sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley for the open layup. The two exchanged a look, seemingly as if to communicate that Arizona State’s defense would give them that look for the rest of the game. They exploited this pocket repeatedly, finding their rhythm and propelling the No. 17 USC Trojans to a 89-71 victory over the Arizona State Sun Devils at the Galen Center Wednesday night. 
“We had a feel for each other,” Evan said. “I fed [Isaiah] a lot of my assists … Anytime I got in the post, his man would come over, I would see him for a quick second, I trust him … and it was an easy layup every time.”
The Trojans’ blowout win completed their season sweep over the Sun Devils and pushed them to 18-3, a record that the team hasn’t hit since the 1973-74 season. Evan and Isaiah Mobley finished with 22 and 20 points, respectively — a career high for Isaiah — and senior guard Tahj Eaddy chipped in with another 18 points. 
The interior play between the Mobley brothers was a sight to see as their passes to one another darted through tight passing lanes to set them up for high percentage performance inside looks. Evan finished with seven assists, five of which were to his brother.
“I thought Evan was really good at reading the defense,” Enfield said. “That’s what he’s capable of doing. He’s had many games this year where he should’ve had two or three more assists, in each game, just because our guards miss open shots. But tonight the guys were making shots for him … He looked like Tom Brady with the ball in his hands, just reading the defense and making the right play.”
ASU senior guard Remy Martin was tough to guard for a majority of the night, with a repertoire of stepbacks, drives and tough shots resulting in a 30-point finish. He leads the Pac-12 in scoring this season, and his efforts kept the Sun Devils, who were only down 46-44 at the halftime break, in the game.
“Remy played like an all-league player,”  Enfield. “He was hot tonight. It’s very hard to guard him one-on-one because when he’s making his stepbacks shots, he’s so quick with the ball … But we also know it’s a team game, so we thought that we could challenge everybody else’s shots at the same time.” 
Foul trouble, especially for interior players such as ASU sophomore forward Jalen Graham, allowed the Mobley brothers to run the game in the paint. Ultimately, it was the Trojan defense that sharpened up and led to USC pulling away in the second half. 
“The first half was very uncharacteristic of our team,” Enfield said. “I didn’t think we had that juice in our step defensively. The defense in the second half was what we were accustomed to and what we expect out of our team.” 
The Sun Devils came into the game missing multiple players due to injury. Running a seven-man rotation throughout the game, it was evident that fatigue set in as the game carried on and they weren’t able to keep the game close.
“You gotta show up and play with who you have,” Enfield said. “Arizona State certainly did that. The guys they had on the court were very good players; we just had to guard who was out there and play as hard as we could.”
The Trojans are now on a seven game winning streak and have won 13 of their last 14 games.  USC will stay at home to face Arizona this Saturday at Galen Center. Tip off is at 3 p.m.
“It’s definitely been an excellent ride so far, even through the bumps and the mud,” Isaiah said. “I’m glad that I’m picking it up now. Hopefully we can ride this thing out, keep winning like this and make a run in the tournament.”

The USC women’s golf team won the Sun Devil Winter Classic at the Talking Stick Golf Club Piipaash Course in Scottsdale, Ariz. on Tuesday.
The team finished the three-day tournament with a strong overall score of 6-under 858. The host of the tournament, Arizona State, trailed close behind in second place with a score of 2-under 862. Arizona came in third place with a score of 20-over 884. 
The tournament was only USC’s second of the season after winning the Lamkin San Diego Invitational last week with a 16-over par finish. 
Having to travel to another state each week always brings a new challenge, according to senior Amelia Garvey. 
“It was really different,” Garvey said. “Last week was very narrow and you really had to keep the ball in play but this was really firm and fast and windy as well … you really had to play strategically and play for the bounds.” 
The tournament was especially important in light of the fact that the field was made up of majority Pac-12 teams. The only Pac-12 team missing from the tournament’s lineup was Stanford. 
Leading the Trojans for the second week in a row was graduate student Allisen Corpuz. The veteran finished third individually with a score of 3-under 213 after being 1-under in each round. 
Sophomore Linn Grant of ASU and sophomore Emma Spitz of UCLA came in first and second, respectively. 
USC seniors Alyaa Abdulghany and Amelia Garvey tied for fourth at 2-under 214. 
“I started off with 10 pars and it’s easy to sort of chas[e] birdies when you know it’s out there, but I just really stayed patient and waited for the birdies to come,” Garvey said. “And I think as a team we did the same thing, we weren’t going at flags, we were playing pretty conservatively in the wind and it obviously paid off.” 
Freshman Brianna Navarrosa followed, finishing tied for 11th with a 3-over 219. Junior Katherine Muzi struggled finishing 31st with a 10-over 226. 
In her USC golf debut, sophomore transfer Alexa Melton, who entered solely as an individual, finished in ninth with a 1-over 217.
After the first round, USC was in third place trailing four shots from the lead. But they did not let the numbers affect them. 
“Golf is such a crazy game,” Garvey said. “That’s nothing over four or five people and two more days. Five shots can be made up in three holes just with one person so it’s not the way you start, it’s always the way you finish, and just being in contention after the first day is where you want to be.”
With last year’s season cut short by the coronavirus, the players are still getting back into the groove of tournament play. 
“The more tournament rounds I play [the more I’m going to] be able to learn from and just get back into that sort of feeling of being under pressure and knowing what shots to hit,” Garvey said. “I think it’s the same for the team not taking these wins for granted … but also taking a bit of confidence from the way we played because it was a big win.” 
The Trojans will look to secure their third win of the season next week at The Gold Rush in Seal Beach, Calif.

USC will halt making new investments in fossil fuels and will begin liquidating current investments in an effort to make sustainability a priority, the University announced in a news release Wednesday. 
The decision comes after a Feb. 4 vote from the USC Board of Trustees Investment Committee and efforts by faculty, staff, student groups including DivestSC and student governments urging the University to divest its $277 million in fossil fuel investments — 5% of the $5.5 billion endowment. 
“Going forward, our new investment policies reinforce USC’s commitment to generate strong returns while also upholding USC’s values, including sustainability,” Chief Investment Officer Amy Diamond said in the press release. “We see this approach as a way to grow our portfolio and support clean, new technologies for the 21st century.” 
USC’s decision to phase out fossil fuel investments also followed ongoing climate concerns and the possibility of a reduced demand for fossil fuels as the sector becomes unattractive with governments and corporations investing in renewables and businesses combating climate change, Diamond said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
“We’re very excited about increasing our efforts to identify attractive investments in funds or strategies that are looking to tackle climate change,” Diamond said. “The important thing is that we’ll be looking for investments that have attractive investment returns. And so, you will see us making more investments.”
According to the press release, USC has not made fossil fuel investments for the last two years. However, the liquidation process will take several years as investments are “primarily in long-dated private partnerships” and “illiquid in nature.”
Pleased by the recent announcement, DivestSC co-founders Nathaniel Hyman and Tianna Shaw-Wakeman said they were shocked, not by USC’s plans to freeze and liquidate their fossil fuel investments, but by the University’s fast-paced nature in implementing this sustainability effort. 
“It shows a clear intention and a sense of purpose that they’re doing this, not just because it’s the financially healthy thing to do but because it’s the ethically healthy thing to do,” said Hyman, who is also one of the co-chairs for DivestSC. “It’s great that this is happening. We’re not under the impression that our work is done yet; we recognize that there’s going to be a process, a process by which students and faculty will need to be involved to ensure transparency and robustness or thoroughness.”
For Shaw-Wakeman, the decision shows future commitment to taking action, including the large amount of money to be diverted to green technology and renewable energy and USC’s change as an institution more focused on sustainability, equity and their “responsibility to the wider world.”
However, after months-long efforts of urging the University to divest that included protests, campaigns and various meetings with President Carol Folt, the Investment Committee and the former CIO, Shaw-Wakeman also said the decision also displays the efforts of the student activists involved. Working to solve difficult issues, such as climate change at USC, can feel like a “consistent uphill battle as students,” she said — but added that seeing the efforts pay off was inspiring. 
“When you do find out that things are changing, and it’s certainly somewhat related to efforts that you worked on with your fellow students; it feels like other things are possible,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “You revel in the moment, and you think about how amazing it is that advocacy and activism actually works and that it really does yield change that is needed in our world.”
Hyman said the significance of the University committing to divesting all of its endowment in the future is “fairly massive,” as USC is the second largest private university in the United States to divest from fossil fuels — Columbia University being the first — and will set a precedent for other schools to follow. Shaw-Wakeman said this was particularly impressive due to the size and esteem of the USC endowment.
“The actual significance of the move will lead to the ripple effects of a lot of other institutions, hopefully doing the same thing, us being one of the many institutions who have done it,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “And then of course, the actual act of moving funds from the fossil fuel industry into more responsible energies that are going to hopefully help our endowment grow, that are going to be a part of us fighting climate change, that are going to be a part of our futures.”
The University will also create an Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility to review ethical and social concerns and advise the Investment Committee on issues regarding endowment investments. Set to start Fall 2021, the committee will consist of faculty, students, alumni and staff who will report directly to the president, Diamond said. 
“I am very pleased with the decision made by the Investment Committee and look forward to working with the advisory committee on investment responsibility,” said Folt in the press release. “This is the right action for USC.”
According to Victoria Petryshyn, assistant professor of environmental studies, the move means that the money being invested into fossil fuels can now be targeted toward other sustainable renewable energy. 
“I think it’s a great optics move,” Petryshyn said. “It does send a message when a place like Harvard or Stanford, some place with an enormous multibillion dollar endowment says we are no longer going to invest in fossil fuel corporations.” 
Petryshyn added that while USC has not known in the past what to do in regard to sustainability, having Folt who has a background in environmental sciences means that a lot of conversations regarding sustainability that weren’t previously considered can now take place. 
“We’ve been very behind other universities for a long time,” Petryshyn said. “We had like one person in the Office of Sustainability and … you look at what other major universities are doing and you’re like ‘wow this is embarrassing.’ But now, I mean Carol Folt is serious about it.”
The Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed a resolution in support of DivestSC in mid-November that called for University administrators to reinvest these funds in clean technologies and renewable energy.  
“This is an example of administration, refining what our mission is, refining what values we all have and making sure that action and money … is in alignment with those values,” USG President Gabe Savage said. “I’m thrilled that the University has made this decision not just thinking about money, but thinking about the morality of it and the ethical implications of how the University spends its money.” 
The decision is part of USC’s environmental eight-year master plan for “ambitious sustainability goals.” The University’s environmental efforts have up until now included initiatives such as employee discounts for bus and rail passes, solar panels installed at the Galen Center and their Urban Forest Project in partnership with the city of Los Angeles.

With Broadway shut down and many local theatres still closed, theatre-lovers are left wondering how much longer until they are able to return to normalcy. Luckily, just like how classes have moved to Zoom, musical theatre has also currently been thriving on the virtual platform. One such project that made its way to our home screens is “USUCC: An Original Zoomsical,” written and directed by Brian Ryu and Julia Krom, and choreographed by 2019 USC graduate Cristyn Dang.
But before she came to be involved with the virtual project, Dang has been dancing for as long as she could remember. 
“I wouldn’t sit still,” Dang said. 
When she was only 4 years old, Dang began training in ballet and tap dance. However, it wasn’t until one day sitting on a bench after dance class in middle school that she realized what dance truly meant to her.
“I was like, ‘Okay, I think this is something I really want to take more seriously … to possibly do professionally in the future,’” Dang said. “So from there, I started dancing more days per week.”
As she progressed from middle school through high school, Dang had already added hip-hop and jazz styles to her repertoire, was consistently given lead roles and was competing locally. It was also in high school where Dang had her first taste at choreographing for musical theatre in her school’s production of “The Pajama Game.”
“I think, especially with musical theatre, there’s so much dynamic and so much story left to build,” Dang said. “The storytelling aspects of choreographing intertwined with the technical dance aspects … [are] some of my favorite parts about choreographing musicals.”
Beginning her journey as a Trojan, Dang took up a major in psychology and, unsurprisingly, a minor in dance.
Like most people initially exposed to musical theatre, Dang, driven by her interest, jumped onto the next opportunity to get involved.
“Once I was at USC, I heard about ‘West Side Story’ in my junior year,” Dang said. 
Intrigued by the contributions of talent from three different fields — music, theatre and dance — Dang auditioned and was cast in the production. 
While musical theatre wasn’t her primary focus as an undergraduate in terms of dance, Dang had opportunities to choreograph for the hip-hop team, as well as in the styles of jazz, funk and heels. 
It was also during Dang’s time at USC that marked a turning point in her dance career.
While performing at a tribute to Dean Torrence as a benefit for Cigna Health Care, she was recommended by Glorya Kaufman School of Dance adjunct assistant professor Saleemah E. Knight to Go 2 Talent Agency, which, in signing with them, paved the way to many future professional dance opportunities for Dang.
In the present, with all of her dance background and the ongoing freeze placed on the performing arts due to the coronavirus, it was only a matter of time before Dang happened upon the “zoomsical,” a concept conceived by creators Ryu and Krom as the next installment to their ongoing web series “Hocaca TV” on YouTube. 
The story follows Hannah the Hound (portrayed by Amanda Kristin Cox), an adjunct professor at the University School of Unified Character Craft, or USUCC. Hannah faces a demand for a tuition refund from her students Nick (Jake Ellsworth), Charlie (Ian Parker) and Emily (Hannah Duran) when they start to feel they aren’t receiving the educational experience they deserve as the school goes online due to the pandemic. Little does she know that another professor (Kevin Herrera) from rival school Hocaca West is planning to take her place.
During the production process, Dang, like Ryu and Krom, was met with new challenges borne out of the switch to working virtually.
“I think Cristyn had a really unique challenge,” Ryu said. “As she was choreographing, we were still recording on the other side so all she had was the bare minimum of piano tracks … and she just somehow made the choreography work.” 
And for this specific project, Dang’s choreography literally speaks for itself.
“I think the thing that’s so amazing about Cristyn is that she really, for this project, choreographed to the lyrics and was able to capture the emotions of the songs and the performers through the movement.” Krom said. “Even though she didn’t have much to work with in terms of the music at that point, she really was able to connect emotionally [to the story].”
To illustrate her creative process, Dang recalls how she came up with the choreography to the antagonist’s lament in the “Villain Song,” performed by Herrera.
“When I choreograph, I really just like to listen to it once. And then kind of improv,” Dang said. “I knew that [Herrera’s solo] was more of a somber, reflective and introspective number. But it’s also him becoming more confident in himself, like the fact that he’s becoming mischievous, [so] I was just really inspired by everything the music had to offer.”
However, the most significant challenge for Dang was having all of the show’s dance instruction confined to the mercy of each cast member’s screen.
“In terms of space, I knew that everyone was limited to just their bedrooms or their living rooms that they’d be filming in,” Dang said. “So the choreography couldn’t include a lot of transitions or large expansive movements and I knew that everyone … couldn’t interact with one another.”
Nevertheless, Dang worked both tirelessly and creatively to produce choreography that went around such obstacles, as seen in the number “USUCC Is Not Our Home,” where each character’s choreography was filmed separately but edited close together to appear as though everyone was grabbing each other’s hands.
Aside from the obvious challenges that a choreographer like Dang would have to face, she also notes the more nuanced upsides to working virtually.
“Seeing everyone in more of a confined space, [I’m] able to watch more closely,” Dang said. “As opposed to having to scan an entire studio and not being able to watch everyone at one time.”
Using this positive to her advantage, Dang also had cast members stop and watch each other closely as everyone performed to receive feedback and reinforce the communal energy of a dance studio lost in a virtual setting.
“I divided everyone into two groups,” Dang said. “And it was just so exciting to see everyone really get into their characters and truly own who they were as dancers and actors.”
Ryu and Krom also pointed out Dang’s energetic and charismatic approach to teaching the choreography to the cast members, which minimized the common notion of the prevailing stress of doing such activities over Zoom.
“It honestly feels like you’re in a Zumba class or something,” Ryu said. “It was amazing seeing how much energy she had for a two-hour long rehearsal process.”
With her experience in teaching dance, Dang was quick to make sure that the unique experience from learning dance in person wasn’t lost. She jumped right into rehearsals, led warm-ups at the beginning of each session and scheduled when each water break took place.
“The whole reason we did this was to have fun,” Krom said. “Every rehearsal was just fun and everybody, I think, really felt the energy.” 
In terms of moving forward from the release of “USUCC,” as an incoming medical student, Dang sees her focus leaning more towards her field for the time being. However, her passion for the performing arts will always have a special place in her heart.
“I would love to continue choreographing and dancing in the future,” Dang said. “I’d love to use additional spare time … whether that be on a musical theatre platform or potentially creating dance concept videos in the realm of more jazz or hip-hop.”
Whatever the case, because of this virtual outlet, there will no doubt be an influx of future performers and creators, like Dang and the team of “USUCC,” that will take advantage of the potential opportunities it has to offer. In doing so, members of the performing arts community have proven that even the coronavirus stands no chance in preventing them from doing what they love while sharing their talents to the rest of the world.

Aria Aaron, Libby Blasser, Michelle Matsuba and Isabella Palacios met for the first time in June 2019 at a professional development program. Over a year later, the four MBA students won the first major case competition by a major business school focused on issues of racial justice. 
“[The competition] kind of became this unique moment for all four of us to work together because we’re not all in the same classes,” Blasser said. “That was the perfect moment.” 
The team, Coalition 4 Change, won the Emory University John R. Lewis Justice Case Competition in late January. The competition attracted teams from top business schools around the country, including the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard Business School, and ended with six finalists competing for a cash price of $25,000. 
Aaron heard about the competition early last November through an email from the creator of the competition, Willie Sullivan. She then disseminated the case competition through the Marshall Business Competition Program, through which Blasser, Matsuba and Palacios heard about the competition.
“We really got excited about the competition because all four of our team members are not only diverse women at USC Marshall who identify as Black and Latina, but we all believe in the power and responsibility that corporations hold in propelling change for racial justice and social justice,” Blasser said. “For us, this was a moment where we could put our passions into play and get our hands dirty, and really work on something that we care about in a way that we felt would hopefully make a positive impact.”
After deciding to enter the competition, Coalition 4 Change submitted a preliminary application consisting of a PowerPoint presentation about how businesses should address issues of racial inequality. Following that, teams entered into the semifinal round, where they were given six weeks to conduct research and create recommendations for a case prompt for an assigned corporation.
According to Palacios, the team utilized a three-phase approach as they worked on the competition. During the first phase, the four students developed an understanding of the problem of racial injustice in the context of their assigned corporation, Johnson & Johnson. In the second phase, the team researched background information and data within the company in order to create a recommendation for how the corporation could best utilize their resources to address problems of racial injustice. For Coalition 4 Change, this involved researching why Black girls find it difficult to find an interest in the STEM field. The last phase involved validating the planned recommendation with a budget and a market survey.
“I know one of the main things they were looking for was how bold and creative your recommendations were, aside from how feasible,” Palacios said. 
Aaron credits the team’s diversity, along with the mutual trust and respect the members have for one another, as the key to the team’s success. 
“One of the amazing things is when we were brainstorming, there are so many times somebody would have an idea, and we’d go build upon that and get really excited about it,” Aaron said. “Being on a diverse team allows you to have those different perspectives and bring them all to the table, and at the end of the day, if you don’t bring it to the forefront, those ideas … stay stuck and will never be seen or presented.”
Despite not having any classes together, Blasser said they utilized their classroom experiences from their Marshall coursework to inform their preparation for the competition. 
“In the core curriculum for USC Marshall, we all have to work on consulting projects,” Blasser said. “Those projects gave all of us a good baseline understanding of how to approach a complex problem with unique and innovative ideas … All four of us have unique individual skills that we’ve acquired through our professional experience as well as the elective courses that we’ve been taking.”
Through these experiences, the team felt prepared when it came to addressing problems during the competition.
“I think we did a great job of really preparing ourselves for the entirety of the competition,” Aaron said. “We were very intentional about really taking and laying the groundwork first, and really figuring out what the problem was.”
Following the competition, the winning team was awarded a grand prize of $25,000, half of which was donated to non-profit organizations of the members’ choice. Driven by a personal mission of empowering women of color, Coalition 4 Change decided to donate $6,250 each to Step Up, an organization that empowers girls of color to pursue their college education, and Black Girls Code, an organization that encourages Black girls to pursue coding lessons and STEM courses.
“We really went to this competition with the mission, which is our personal mission as well, of empowering women of color to become their full selves, who pursue their opportunities in executive level positions in corporate America, or wherever they want to go,” Palacios said.
As future business executives and leaders of society, the team said they felt MBA students were critical components to the issue of racial injustice and social change in the country. 
“This type of competition, as a future business leader, really gives you a perspective of how you can help and how easy it is to help regardless of whether you’re in an executive position or an entry-level employee … to make an impact, drive change and not only to be part of the conversation but really act upon it,” Palacios said.

To celebrate the release of “To All the Boys: Always and Forever,” Capitol Music Group and °1824 hosted a press conference Feb. 16 with artists from the soundtrack of the third and final installment of the “To All the Boys I Loved” franchise.
With messages from fans flooding the Zoom chat, the press conference bustled with energy as over 400 participants joined to converse with artists Ashe, Leah Nobel, Jordan Suaste, Peter Manos and The Greeting Committee.
Ashe, whose 2019 hit “Moral of the Story” was featured in the second film, created a lot of buzz in the call with fans excited to hear about her song for the third film. Shortly after the second film’s release, the franchise’s music supervisors pitched the idea to Ashe about producing another single for the third movie while they were out having drinks. Though the idea was casually tossed around at first, the 27-year-old singer eventually wrote “The Same” for the film. 
Having gotten a preview of the two scenes her song would be playing in, Ashe created different versions of “The Same” with slight tweaks in chords and production to match the scenes’ polarizing feelings of love and heartbreak.
Nobel, on the other hand, had not seen the first and second movie prior to composing her track, “Beginning Middle End.” She also didn’t know what movie she was writing a song for; she only had knowledge of its rom-com genre, so Nobel relied on the email outline she received from the music supervisors as an essential part of her song’s creation.
“Me and my collaborator Quinn Redmond, who was my co-writer and also produced the song, used the brief as kind of an anchor point to start creating,” Nobel said. “In addition to that, we filled in the story with some anecdotes from my personal life, and that’s kind of how [the song] was born.”
Nobel was excited, but apprehensive, about the prospect of her work being featured in the popular blockbuster film. Nonetheless, Nobel “was shook” about how “Beginning Middle End” was incorporated into the storyline: the track represented the tender love story of main characters LaraJean Covey and Peter Kavinsky.
“Films change their minds so many times, and it’s very likely that your song or your scene could get cut, so my first reaction was like ‘this wasn’t going to go through,’” Nobel said. “It was revealed to me in degrees as time passed how my song was sort of integrated into the film. I didn’t know that in the beginning, I just knew they were slow dancing to it and The Greeting Committee’s going to cover it … It was really cool to hear it incorporated in dialogue and sort of referenced to it almost as a character in the film.”
Suaste added that he reacted less logically and more emotionally, stirring laughter in the call when he shared the relatable story of the first time he received notice that his ballad “If The World Ended Tonight” would be added to the soundtrack. A fan of the franchise, Suaste described that he “had a full mental breakdown” and screamed while he was at the bank getting a loan.
Manos’ single “In My Head” perfectly encapsulated the feeling of change and growing up reflected in “To All the Boys: Always and Forever” as the characters graduated high school and entered college.
“When I made the song, it was a few years ago; I was closer to the age of Peter and LaraJean in the movie. I think I wrote about a similar time in my life that they were going through in the movie, so I think naturally because of personal experience, it fits,” Manos said.
He didn’t fail to keep the mood light with a story about how he “got dumped in high school pretty bad.” It worked out in the end though because Manos and his current girlfriend are going strong and are fans of the movie franchise, making his involvement in the third film’s soundtrack that much more “sick.”
Nobel found that “To All the Boys: Forever and Always” was nostalgic to her own senior year when she, like Lara Jean, decided to choose a different path for college and not stay close to her high school boyfriend. After hearing this, the process of how she wrote “Beginning Middle End” makes more sense and resonates perfectly with the film. 
Indie band The Greeting Committee burst into laughter when bassist Pierce Turcotte revealed that he was in a high school relationship that almost tore the band apart. Luckily, it didn’t or else they would not have made their cameo in the film and made viewers swoon with their cover of Nobel’s “Beginning Middle and End” during the iconic rooftop prom scene, which Suaste added was his favorite scene. The band’s “Run for Your Money” and “17” were also on the soundtrack.
“When we found out we got to go [on set], it was definitely a whirlwind. It happened very quickly; it was like 36 hours in New York City [with] no sleep … We were on the rooftop until five or six in the morning, and we had been there essentially all day long,” lead vocalist Addison Sartino said. “We’ve done covers of songs before, but not something to this extent or of this importance … I definitely think it hits nostalgia in our fans like ‘I wish we could be on a rooftop with The Greeting Committee right now.’”
Participants of the conference call alluded to the soundtrack in general as creating a feeling of nostalgia throughout the film. When asked about the incorporation of music from several decades to create the movie’s romantic, coming-of-age atmosphere, the artists repeatedly highlighted the idea that “love is timeless,” which was first spoken by The Greeting Committee.
Nobel thought it was cool of the soundtrack to introduce younger audiences to older music, then joked that she “felt unworthy” to be in the soundtrack alongside the Spice Girls. Ashe chimed in comically by asking why the Spice Girls weren’t in the conference call.
“Older music is popping up more and more on TikTok and everything too. It’s just coming into culture nowadays, and I think it is because love is timeless like The Greeting Committee said,” Suaste said. “There’s a different form of love written into those [older] songs.” 
Though the “To All the Boys I Loved” trilogy came to an end this past Valentine’s weekend, the success of these five artists is only beginning. Fans should anticipate new music from the artists in the coming months.
“To All the Boys: Always and Forever” and its soundtrack have been available on Netflix and various music streaming platforms, respectively, since Feb. 12.

This NBA season has been full of outstanding performances and eye-catching headlines almost every night. 
Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid has been flat out dominant. He’s been averaging 29.6 points per game and 10.8 rebounds per game on 54% shooting from the field — an absolutely absurd number for the big man who’s preached “trusting the process.”
Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been crafty on the court, averaging nearly a triple-double with 26.5 ppg, 11.5 rpg and 8.7 assists per game. If you thought Embiid was balling for a big man, earlier this month Jokic became the first center since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975 to drop 50 points and 10 assists in a game. 
The NBA is wild once again. 
But nothing flipped the entire league on its head more than a trade in January. Roughly a month into the season, the Houston Rockets traded superstar guard James Harden to the Brooklyn Nets forming a trio with fellow ballers Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. 
As a Lakers fan, I was scared, to say the least. My beloved team had just won their first title in ten years in the bubble and will now have to go through a unicorn of an offensive lineup in order to repeat. 
With enough time, however, it became clear that not even this Nets team could defend against a varsity team. 
They gave up 149 points against the Washington Wizards, 147 to the Cleveland Cavaliers and 122 to the Detroit Pistons. These three teams now all have two things in common — they beat the Nets and have records below .500.
Unfortunately, the Lakers have not really looked up to par, and the Nets are their biggest threat.
A record of 22-7 is pretty impressive on paper. Especially considering they had a mere 71 days, the shortest offseason in sports history, to celebrate their championship, assemble a new cast and tip-off a new season. 
At times, they’ve really flexed their muscles, handling top Eastern Conference contenders such as the Milwaukee Bucks and the Boston Celtics on the road. 
LeBron James is still defying father time, playing like he’s 26 and not 36. The emergence of Kyle Kuzma as a role player and hustler is amazing to see. Montrezl Harrell and Dennis Schroeder have also been as good as advertised. 
The question coming into the season was how their rim protection and defense would fare after losing key shot-blockers Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee. Consider that question answered, as the Lakers allow the second-fewest points a game and are currently tied with the Indiana Pacers for the most blocks per game.
It’s been a pretty seamless transition into the new season. 
However, there have been some bumps in the road. What their record does not make apparent are some lethargic performances against sub-par teams. 
Against the Golden State Warriors at home, the Lakers were up 16 at halftime but ended up losing the game after a collapse in the second half. Against the 76ers, Los Angeles needed a 13-0 run in the final minutes just to take a one-point lead, but not before 76ers forward Tobias Harris hit the game-winner, saving the day for Philadelphia. And against the Detroit Pistons, the Lakers were flat out awful, looking tired on the back end of a back to back, losing by 15 to a team with only four wins at the time. 
After losing back to back games, the Lakers turned it on and were on a seven-game winning streak. However, three straight wins went into overtime — once against the Pistons and twice against the Oklahoma City Thunder — two teams at the bottom of the standings in their conferences.
Slow starts, inconsistent play and sloppy efforts against lesser opponents have led to LeBron James carrying them at times. The Lakers’ performances lately have not been reminiscent of a team with the second-best record in the NBA. They have to handle the far superior teams they face, just like champions do, and save their energy for the tougher battles.
Outside of LeBron, the help has been limited to players like Schroeder, Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kuzma. 
Forward Anthony Davis has been nonexistent at times. 
Sure, Davis is an all-world talent and can take over games, but his play has been indifferent from Harris. Unlike LeBron, who has come out flying, Davis still looks hungover from all the champagne he drank during the offseason. 
The forward is averaging almost 23 points a game this season, but really hasn’t been dominant. Outside of a 37-point performance against his hometown Chicago Bulls, the brow has been quiet. With 27 games in the season, the generational talent has only played like a common one. 
All things considered, he’s my biggest concern with this Lakers team — can they find a way to get Davis in rhythm?
An Achilles scare against the Denver Nuggets this week surely will not help. The injury, described as “Achilles tendinosis,” will put Davis out for at least the next 2-3 weeks — a manageable nightmare scenario for the defending champs.
When the time comes around for his return in the playoffs in May, Davis will hopefully be ready. Obviously, Davis has been doubled by defenses consistently, and that ultimately cuts his performance short. All I’m asking for is a little more aggression, a little more fire and a little more passion that will raise our eyebrows.

I’ll get right to it: today I am talking about Israel. 
It actually is funny because I rarely ever feel comfortable talking about Israel in a university setting, despite the fact that the land of Israel is such a dearly held part of my Jewish identity. 
On Passover, a Jewish high holiday, we sing “Next year in Jerusalem.” We pray facing Jerusalem, no matter where in the world we are. These kinds of holy-land-focused traditions, which extend far beyond the two listed above, are thousands of years old. They are also inextricably rooted in the Jewish identity and practice. I can’t pick up a prayer book without considering which direction Israel is. I can’t even choose a dreidel without thinking about Israel (dreidels in Israel and dreidels in other places have different inscriptions). 
That being said, I have always found it interesting that sweeping dismissals of this part of my Jewish identity, the part that is tied to Israel, are so very welcomed in certain academic and progressive circles. In these groups, it feels like everyone else has the right to defend their cultural, ethnic and religious identities except for the Jew. 
These dismissals come in many forms, but we’ll focus on the more egregious Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) that has found a home on so many college campuses. On Feb. 9, 2021 the student government at the University of California, Irvine voted to pass a BDS-supporting resolution 19-3. 
The movement stands for exactly what it sounds like: the boycott of, divestment from and sanctions on the current Jewish state of Israel. Their stated goals are threefold: 1) ending Israel’s occupation of all land captured in 1967, 2) granting full equality to Palestinian citizens of Israel and 3) assuring the Palestinian right of return to any land that they were displaced from during the establishment of Israel in 1948. 
As a mission statement, this seems innocuous enough, however, the founder of the BDS movement and those who champion it agree that none of these aims can be established insomuch as Zionism, the belief in self-determination for the Jewish people in the biblical land of Israel, is upheld. This means that the BDS movement will not be satisfied until there is absolutely no Jewish state existing within the land of Israel (the only place in the world where a Jewish state does and ever has existed).  
From a practical perspective, this movement has done very little to alleviate the very real and significant Palestinian plight. For instance, in 2016, BDS pressures to push then-Israeli-owned company Sodastream out of the Westbank worked. The factories in the Westbank shut down and 500 Palestinians lost their jobs as a result. These boycotts are not just academic exercises or thought experiments, they have real world consequences that affect the vulnerable communities that they purport to fight for. 
More significantly though, it is the structure of Israel’s economy that makes a movement like this entirely moot. Their economy is not built on the exports of commodities that BDS opposes but rather on sales of intellectual property made to businesses, earning them the nickname “Start-up Nation.” These boycotts do very little to affect the business-to-business transactions that underpin Israel’s economy, and what’s more is that when they do, Palestinians often suffer as a result. 
From a principled perspective, the notion of divesting from one nation in the name of helping an entirely separate nation strikes me as odd. Why divest from Israel to help under-resourced Palestinians? Why not invest directly in Palestinian aid or grassroots movements? Why not pressure for policy changes, a much more attainable tangible goal, instead of for the eradication of an entire Jewish state? It is a lack of satisfactory answers to these questions that leaves me and many other Jewish people feeling like these movements are more about opposing Jewish self-determination than they are about supporting Palestinian liberation. 
What this movement does successfully accomplish is the alienation of Jewish students and further, Jewish people. Calling for the mass boycott of Israel is a way to publicly stand against the existence of a Jewish nation in a land that Jews are indigenous to. In doing so, the movement is denying a huge part of the Jewish identity from having an acceptable place in social life. If that is not antisemitism, then I ask what is. 
This kind of alienation of Jewish students in the form of BDS is also poorly timed. Over the last 10 years, France (and the rest of the world) has seen a vicious spike in acts of antisemitism. From the murder of a Holocaust survivor, to the desecration of listless amounts of sites with swastikas, to violent attacks on people who are visibly Jewish, France has not felt safe for the community for a long time. Notably, over these same 10 years, French Jews have immigrated to Israel in record numbers. 
This exodus being the result of the country’s rising antisemitism has been well-documented. French Jews report fleeing the country because they believe Israel is the only place where they will not face the kind of antisemitism that is woven into the history of so many countries, including their own. Support for BDS is akin to opposing the existence of the only place that feels safe for many Jewish people around the world. 
I’d now like to call on readers to use their imagination. Imagine what would happen if, during this rampant resurgence of antisemitism, Jews did not have a place to go home to unconditionally. To be a Jew without a home is to be a sitting duck. I’d like to call on readers to oppose the BDS movement on campuses, in politics and everywhere else, and to think twice before speaking on such a complex issue that is dear to the hearts of so many.

The beginning of the coronavirus pandemic nearly a year ago exposed the cracks in our hierarchical food production and processing system. When the world first shut down last March, the supply chain was disrupted as outbreaks occurred and processing factories and restaurants were closed. Shelves were emptied at grocery stores and shortages of commonplace ingredients were prevalent. Fruit rotted away on trees and milk was dumped into the soil.
This is no new phenomenon. Since the beginning of industrialization, food waste has been rampant. 
In our capitalistic society, everything has a value, and our adherence to this ideology was crystal clear this past year. Edible food is regularly discarded at every step along the production process, from farmers planting in excess, to grocery stores throwing out food that has reached its ‘sell-by’ date. If market conditions aren’t right — that is, if the price of the produce is lower than that of the cost of transportation and labor, or the demand for a specific product falls unexpectedly — farmers may choose to leave crops completely unharvested and lose comparatively less money on the transaction. 
The produce dumping process hit new highs when schools, hotels and restaurants closed. Some of the biggest clients of bulk suppliers were no longer in need of their regular orders, and farmers made the decision to dump out gallons of milk and plow over crops rather than spend the money on harvesting and processing unwanted food. 
Even as consumer demand at the grocery store level soared, the amount of food coming out of farms and factories dwindled. The supply chain shifted as the movement of food became more complex. Food producers struggled to quickly adapt from selling their food to bulk buyers to selling to individual retailers. Production efforts had to be recalibrated in order to comply with coronavirus restrictions and regulations, and less employees and truckers were available to work. 
While some farms, wholesale distributors and restaurants were able to pivot their distribution strategies effectively during the pandemic surges, there continues to be a significant gap between the mountains of food going to waste and those who remain hungry. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food security is defined as the “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” This broad definition glosses over nutritional equality nuances, vitamin and mineral deficiencies and specificities of accessibility that have all been brought into question this past year. 
Pre-pandemic, some 10.5% of American families had experienced food insecurity at some point during 2019. Because of the following economic outbreak brought on by the virus, this number jumped to around 23% during 2020. While households with children are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, this was only compounded by school closures — essentially denying food-insecure children at least one nutritious meal a day during the school week. 
More people than ever before utilized the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the government’s food assistance program for low-income families; yet these food stamps are often lacking in their value and convenience, limiting users to specific stores, brands and items. While the government has programs and subsidies to buy excess food from producers and distribute them to food banks and emergency relief organizations, the bureaucratic red tape, costliness and half-baked result is almost not worth the effort. 
In 2020, under former President Donald Trump, the USDA developed a buyback program that relieved farms of unwanted produce, packaging them up and shipping out food boxes to families in need. However, not only was it not run by the USDA’s food aid department, it also overpaid producers because it contracted out the deliveries of the boxes to food banks, compromising the quality of the produce when it showed up as well as the actual effectiveness of where the boxes were being sent. Produce often showed up rotten or was dispersed without variety and people received boxes of single ingredients.  
According to a study conducted at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, more than one in four Los Angeles County households had experienced at least one instance of food insecurity over the summer. This worsened already-high levels experienced by marginalized groups, including Latinx people, women and those who were unemployed or low-income, and even impacted demographics who have historically been less likely to experience food insecurity. 
Especially in South Central, which has historically been a food desert, irregular access to nutritious food is not abnormal. Food deserts — areas where it can be harder to find fresh fruits and vegetables due largely to a lack of grocery stores, farmers markets and health food providers — are often marked by inadequate public transportation, inconsistent vehicle accessibility and a community income level lower than the national average. 
While this is a problem that is being addressed and slowly remediated via policy changes, microloans and lucrative social enterprises, many smaller independently-run corner stores lack the access to wholesale distributors and often have to purchase their own produce at retail prices to then resell to customers. Buying at higher prices only means that grocery store customers in these low-income areas have to pay exorbitant prices for fresh food. 
Due to the pandemic, international food import and exportation has also been heavily impacted. Smaller, more limited nations that relied on food importation — essentially food deserts on a wider scale — were left high and dry as major agricultural exporters like the U.S. lessened their shipment frequency and quantities and forced them to get creative with crop production and more localized trading. By reversing the displacement of regionally grown produce with imports, small countries and island nations have started to substitute foreign imports with native substitutes, create more jobs, improve local infrastructures and build their self-sufficiency. 
As the world population has grown, thus far, we’ve been able to claw our way along the Malthusian curve, keeping pace with the ever-increasing demand. Thanks to economic growth and improved agricultural technology, strides have been made toward eradicating world hunger. However, people across the globe are still undeniably malnourished and starving. 
The pandemic exposed the critical issues and inadequacies within our food production and distribution systems at both the domestic and international level. As society starts to become vaccinated and life (hopefully) regains some semblance of normalcy, this should be an opportunity to make major institutional changes in how our nation’s food production system works. We need to redefine food security, sufficiently address nutritional needs and deficiencies and emphasize real accessibility and affordability.
Countries need to start from the inside, work to strengthen their own infrastructures, reduce food waste, grow a wider variety of crops, streamline food delivery and transport systems and rewrite the standards for healthy childhood development and nutrition. Every small step taken towards improving our respective food systems is essential in building up the resiliency and security of our global food network.
