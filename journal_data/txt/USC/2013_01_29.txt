Information regarding the benefits and salaries of adjunct professors has historically been difficult to run down, as many universities do not track or make public such details.
Now, adjunct professors are attempting to compile this info themselves through The Chronicle of Higher Education’s new Adjunct Project, which was created by adjunct professors seeking to report their working conditions for review by their peers and the public.
USC employs 1,825 part-time faculty in various fields. According to the Adjunct Project, pay for these professors varies from $3,840 to $8,000 per course, with teachers in the education field reporting the lowest pay and teachers in the field of comparative literature reporting the highest pay. The report does not show the pay for adjunct professors teaching in the math and science fields.
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Beth Meyerowitz said the discrepancy between the pay and benefits among adjunct professors can depend on the various university programs they work for.
“Some part-time faculty are paid a percentage of a full time salary and others are paid by the course,” Meyerowitz said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Their compensation is set in the college or school in which they are appointed. All who work at least half-time qualify for benefits.”
Among reports for colleges nationwide, an adjunct professor’s average pay is $2,987 for a three-unit course. However, the reported median pay at USC among all departments was higher than the reported median for all of California, as well as for the specific departments and for all four-year private not-for-profit colleges, according to the Adjunct Project website.
Responses to adjunct professors’ working conditions — specifically their access to health insurance and retirement plans and ability to participate in faculty governance — were mixed, even among professors of the same department.
Assistant Professor of Linguistics Sandra Disner, all full-time employees receive full benefits at USC whether they are tenured or not. However, adjuncts are not included in all faculty meetings.
“Ever since I became a rank faculty member I’ve been included in meetings,” Disner said. “Before that, when I was a lecturer, I was not.”
USC also has other options for professors who are not on the tenure track. Disner was recently promoted from her position as  adjunct professor to a three-year full-time appointment as an assistant professor, a move she said isn’t necessarily the norm in campuses across the country.
“I’m very happy that USC is a pioneer in this,” Disner said. “Many other universities don’t have anything like this and just hire people semester to semester.”
Though some treat the role of adjunct professor as a full-time job, many adjuncts work in the industry and concurrently teach a course out of their love for education. USC hired Disner, who teaches courses involving linguistics and the law, partly because she served as a forensic linguist.
And Jon C. Smith, an adjunct professor of public relations and a partner at Musa Entertainment Consulting, Inc., has taught at USC since 2001. Before teaching, Smith worked at Channel 4 News, and he believes dividing time between industry work and teaching often leads to the best learning experiences for students.
“When I was in college, my best professors were people who were working journalists and in the real world,” Smith said.
Students often enjoy the expertise shared by those who both work in industry positions and also serve as adjunct professors. Steve Kearns, a freshman majoring public relations, said he benefited from being taught by adjunct professors.
“I enjoy that my PR professor is an industry professional because he can impart real-life work experience and field knowledge upon his students,” Kearns said.
With their unique skill sets in mind, many adjunct professors are using resources such as Adjunct Project  to not only refer to the working conditions and salaries of their peers but to advocate for ethical hiring practices and criticize exploitative faculty models.
“Many of these highly educated and passionate people are being forced to take jobs dramatically below their achievement and earning potential,” the Adjunct Project site explains.
And though it’s not clear where the future of college faculty hiring lies, the growth of resources like Adjunct Project points toward greater inquiry and discourse on the treatment of educators nationwide.

Though some students have seen it, the new Engemann Student Health Center officially opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Tuesday.
Opening · Health Center Director Lawrence Neinstein, President Max C. L. Nikias, naming donors Michele and Roger Engemann and Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson (left to right) reveal the new health center. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The five-level health center, located on West 34th Street near the Lyon Center, opened its doors to sick students, faculty and staff on Jan. 4. Roger Engemann and ’68 alumna Michele Dedeaux Engemann donated $15 million for USC to improve its health facilities.
An audience of alumni, faculty, staff and students gave the Engemanns a standing ovation when Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson introduced them.
It is fitting too, as Michele Engemann’s Trojan roots run deep. Elected to the Board of Trustees in October 2012, Michele Engemann is also a lifetime member of Town & Gown of USC, Skull and Dagger, the Keck Hospital of USC Guild, the Trojan Guild of Los Angeles and the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. She also served as the president of the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors from 2007 to 2008.
Michele Engemann attributes her and her husband’s donation for the health center to an experience from when she was at USC.
According to Michele, she and her play case were getting ready for a weekend show when on a Wednesday at six in the morning she received a call telling her to go to the health center immediately.
She said the health center, a tiny building with “tacky stairs and a ramp,” seemed inadequate when she was a student in the ’60s. When she and her classmates had to get shots, they lined up on the street because the health center was too small to accommodate them.
She then vowed to one day make the health center better.
“We finally made it,” she said.
Construction on the building began in April 2011 and the university estimated it would be complete by February 2013. Roger Engemann was impressed by the early completion.
“It seems like just the other day we were shoveling dirt, wearing hard hats and taking our picture,” Roger Engemann said. “But look! Poof!”
The Engemanns have also helped support USC through a $500,000 donation to the School of Dramatic Arts, where Michele Engemann majored in theatre, and $500,000 for a Baseball Hall of Fame at Dedeaux Field, which is named after Michele Engemann’s father.
President C. L. Max Nikias said the grand opening of the center signifies USC’s commitment to the health of its community.
“This beautiful building has shown that the future has truly arrived at USC,” Nikias said. “It is important for both the students of today and the students of tomorrow.”
Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, thanked the Engemanns for allowing USC to replace the old health center, which was built in 1951.
“[Getting a new health center] has been an 18-year-long journey,” Neinstein said. “The Engemanns made our dream a reality.”
Catherine De Francesco, senior administrative director of the University Park Health Center, credited the final project to the generosity of the Engemanns.
“The students needed a state-of-the-art health center,” Defrancesco said. “The result is pretty amazing.”
Nurse Janice Li, who works at the health center, described the new building as more beautiful, larger and more innovative because of the more modern medical equipment. Li also said with the new space and resources, the health center will be able to have more specialists come in.
“It’s truly state-of-the-art,” Li said.
Julia Dwyer, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, went to the center because of a sprained ankle this semester. When she went, Dwyer was impressed with the new building’s size and resources.
“The new health center is much larger, cleaner and fancier than the old one,” Dwyer said. “It feels like you are in a real hospital and are being taken care of by experts. It has a more professional vibe.”
I’m really delighted that the students have an amazing health center. But couldn’t they have kept operations running – at least for urgent care – during the ceremony?  My daughter needed care and, ironically, nothing was available.
The Engemann Student Health Center appreciates all feedback and we respond to student questions and concerns in an individual manner.  All students, staff, faculty and parents can send us feedback, suggestions and concerns at

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed Tuesday night a resolution that could potentially lead to a complete renovation of the sidewalks in and around The Row. The resolution is a result of the high number of injuries that occur on The Row.
The resolution, “28th Street Sidewalk Project,” passed unanimously. According to Greek Senator Alex Cascante, who spearheaded the writing of the resolution, this moment has been a long time coming. Streets expected to be repaired are the sidewalks on 28th Street from Hoover Street to Figueroa Street and University Avenue from 28th Street to 32nd Street.
“Every Greek Senator before me for the past five or so years has been wanting to fix these sidewalks, but nobody really delved into the issue,” Cascante said. “They all hit the same wall: the sidewalks are owned by the city, the city has no money, and they’re not going to pay for it.”
Cascante conducted a survey during the Fall 2012 semester. He obtained over 100 written student testimonies stating injury as a result of the damaged sidewalks.
“I realized just because the city has no money, that shouldn’t stop this project,” Cascante said. “The big obstacle … was realizing there was an alternative method, which is private funding.”
This resolution gives Cascante permission to raise funds from private funders, such as USC Parent and Alumni Associations.
“The sidewalk poses a serious risk to students, to the school. It’s a huge liability issue. But parents or alumni don’t realize this problem exists … I’m going to reach out to alumni and parent associations, inform them of the issue. It’s up to them from there,” Cascante said.
According to Cascante, part of the problem stems from the area’s dense population of students. 2,724 undergraduates students currently live in the area, he said.
Some students have been overwhelmingly supportive of the sidewalk renovation initiative.
Kamal Bairagdar, a master’s degree candidate for civil engineering, is enthusiastic about the project.
“The Row is an extension of the university campus itself. Students live on it, spend a lot of time on it. We need to take care of the students,” Bairagdar said.
Kristyn Ikeda, a junior majoring in business administration, was more wary of the project, citing potential conflicts.
“The renovation project will cause a lot of logistical problems,” Ikeda said. “Streets might close down, and it will be hard to have a lot of parties with construction going on. I think there are probably better causes to fundraise for that deal with student life.”
Despite the possible difficulties, Cascante remains optimistic of the steps to rebuild the sidewalks along The Row.
“It might not be something that will be accomplished come May, but it will be done eventually because I will help future Senators,” Cascante said.
You can keep your money.  We don’t need your tolerance.  We are here!  We are queer!  Get used to it!
Maybe alcohol is a factor in the many “accidents”?
You people have no idea how much it will cost to replace the sidewalks from Hoover to Fig.   It may cost as much as a half-million all said and done.    That is like a 100 alcohol awareness seminars along with at least one gay or fat sorority girl tolerance seminars.   I submit that it money better spent!

The USC School of Cinematic Arts on Tuesday hosted GLIMPSE, a digital technology event featuring the university’s pre-professional schools, and their cutting-edge research in the field of technology. The day-long event is held every few years to showcase the scientific evolution of the Trojan community.
Take a glimpse · Cyrus Shahabi, director of the Integrated Media Systems Center at the Viterbi School of Engineering, presents his work. – Alexander Harono | Daily Trojan
Randolph Hall, vice president of research at USC, provided the opening remarks for the event.
“USC’s strength in digital technology includes the collaboration between the arts and engineering,” Hall said. “That makes possible a conversation with the avatar of a real witness to history, the recreation of digital actors indistinguishable from their human counterparts.”
Featured presenters included the Executive Director of the USC Shoah Foundation Stephen Smith, Associate Director for Graphics Research at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies Paul Debevec and Director of the Integrated Media Systems Center Cyrus Shahabi. Speakers provided the audience perspective on their technological projects and their future endeavors.
Smith’s project, “New Dimensions in Testimony,” preserves the voices of the past by keeping records of survivors of genocide and other historical massacres with new technologies.
“Because of 21st century technology, interactive holograms can directly answer people’s historical questions,” Smith said. “The advantage of talking to survivors will allow people to learn what it means to be human.”
Light Stage is constantly advancing in the hopes that it will one day be able to create full-body holograms for the everyday conference call, as well as for projects such as Smith’s. Debevec and his team have already created a face hologram and have received funding to build an entire body hologram device.
According to Debevec, it costs a company about $10,000 per day to rent out the Light Stage for their projects.
“Digital media and technology is something special to this university,” Hall said.
Conferences like GLIMPSE bring many of USC’s schools to share ideas and hopefully expand the innovative projects already occurring on campus.

The USC tennis program received two accolades Tuesday, as junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Giuliana Olmos received the Pac-12 men’s and women’s tennis players of the week for the week of Jan. 21-27.
Gomez dominated this past weekend at the ITA Kick-Off, which was hosted at USC’s Marks Tennis Stadium. He won both of his matches in straight sets, first against San Diego State’s Derek Siddiqui 7-6, 6-2. He followed that up on Sunday with a 6-2, 6-3 victory against Fresno State’s Reid DeLaubenfels. Gomez was also impressive in doubles play, playing alongside sophomore Eric Johnson to beat Fresno State by a score of 8-1. All in all, the junior played a key part in helping the Trojans qualify for the ITA National Team Indoor championship, which begins in February.
On the women’s side, Giuliana Olmos truly dominated during the Kick-Off Weekend. She started off with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Akron’s Angelina Jogarusia, contributing to a Trojan sweep of the Zips. She recorded another straight-set victory on Sunday against UC Irvine, with a 6-3, 6-0 defeat of Franziska Goettsching. During doubles play, Olmos played with senior standout Danielle Lao and notched an 8-1 victory.
The men’s and women’s teams have started off the season in impressive fashion. Both teams remain unbeaten and boast top-five rankings nationally, with the men at No. 2 overall and the women currently positioned at No. 4 .
The men will continue their homestand and not play a road match until the middle of next month, while the women travel to Pepperdine on Thursday before returning home for a match with Fresno State.

After compiling a perfect 29-0 record en route to winning its fifth consecutive national championship, the 2012 USC men’s water polo team figured to receive plenty of consideration during the awards season.
Rare accomplishment · Jovan Vavic (above) and junior driver Nikola Vavic were named coach and player of the year, respectively. – Ralph Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
And it did: the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches announced Tuesday that eight USC players — seven of whom already lay claim to 2012 All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation awards — earned All-American honors.
Junior driver Nikola Vavic, junior goalie James Clarke and senior driver Michael Rosenthal captured first-team All-American honors, while sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias and junior two-meter Mace Rapsey earned second and third team honors, respectively. A trio of veteran Trojan stalwarts — senior two-meter Matt Burton, junior two-meter Jeremy Davie and senior driver Stephen Siri — rounded out USC’s All-American honorees, with each player earning honorable mention.
Nikola Vavic, who also won the ACWPC’s player of the year award, appears poised to collect even more hardware as the prohibitive favorite for the coveted Cutino Award, given annually to collegiate water polo’s best player. The three-time All-American broke USC’s single-season scoring record with 83 goals, breaking a previous mark that had stood since 1988, and additionally chipped in a team-leading 65 assists. Now fourth on USC’s all-time scoring list with still another season to play, Nikola Vavic’s nomination makes it nine consecutive years in which USC has had a Cutino Award finalist. The winner will be announced June 1.
Not to be outdone, USC coach Jovan Vavic — Nikola’s father — won the ACWPC’s coach of the year award after completing just USC’s second undefeated season and first since 2008. The fiery coach now boasts a 420-64 career record at USC — a robust .867 winning percentage. Between coaching both the men’s and women’s teams, Jovan Vavic has accumulated 11 national championships, won 11 ACWPC coach of the year awards and has coached 10 Cutino Award winners. Recognizing his unprecedented string of success, USA Water Polo appointed Jovan Vavic interim head coach of the USC Men’s Senior National Team on Nov. 20.

The question seems to make its way through the media airwaves every few weeks.
It’s short and to the point, often posed to those in the public eye: Would you let your child play football?
“I’m a big football fan, but I have to tell you — if I had a son, I’d have to think long and hard before I let him play,” President Barack Obama recently told The New Republic. “And I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence.”
Obama took his comments a step further, specifically referencing college athletes who don’t have a future in the NFL but suffer from concussions. What’s their future?
It’s a touchy issue on both the collegiate and professional levels. In response to Obama’s statement, Baltimore Ravens safety Bernard Pollard issued a dire warning about the sport he plays.
“The only thing I’m waiting for, and, Lord, I hope it doesn’t happen, is a guy dying on the field,” Pollard told CBS Sports. “We’ve had everything else happen there except for a death. We understand what we signed up for, and it sucks.”
The way Pollard describes football, you’d think participants in the sport are modern-day gladiators. Heck, USC certainly hasn’t distanced itself from that comparison, seeing as the Trojans play at a stadium called the Coliseum to a crowd of more than 90,000.
In actuality, the increasing doubts about the safety of America’s favorite pastime (sorry, baseball) largely stem from the potential brain damage it causes. The USC community knows this all too well following the tragic suicide of former Trojan and San Diego Charger Junior Seau. Seau’s family recently sued the NFL, claiming his chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which was discovered in an autopsy, was a direct result of the violent hits he delivered. It’s a horrific situation without a clear resolution.
At this point, the fact that a sustained football career leads to brain damage isn’t breaking news. The last few years have raised awareness on the issue and brought it to the forefront of discussions about the sport. But Obama’s point of emphasis — referring to the college athletes without an NFL future — is one worth re-examining.
For every Marqise Lee who will someday make a career out of his football abilities, there are thousands of unsung backups absorbing the same hits, taking the same risks. And in a few years, those are the players who will emerge without much to show for their years of dedication to the game they love to play. There won’t be multimillion dollar contracts waiting post-graduation — most will be entering the workforce like everyone else. If polled, I’m sure the vast majority of former college athletes would say they have no regrets about choosing to commit so much time to such a physical sport. Maybe that’s true. But if they were asked the same question in 20, 30, 40 years, would that answer change?
Earlier this week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell took questions on Reddit, the majority of which revolved around player safety. He did his best to play the PR game of preaching player safety without addressing many specific changes, other than eliminating low blocks on defenders. He’s in a tricky spot: The NFL is flourishing. College football is flourishing. USC football is, and will remain, the most popular sport on campus (and it’s not even remotely close). What are the higher-ups in collegiate and professional sports supposed to do?
For the time being, almost everyone with some sort of vested interest in football is guilty of talking the talk without walking the walk. The USC community rallied around the life of Seau for the season-opener on Sep. 2 against the University of Hawai’i. We all wore “Trojan Pride 55” bracelets and commemorated his life with a moment of silence. It was a touching scene that the Seau family no doubt appreciated.
Then the game started, and we cheered on the Trojans as they delivered crushing blows to their opponents en route to a 49-10 victory. And we kicked the can down the road, waiting for science to catch up to a sport that may very well be taking years off the lives of its participants.
I’m not pretending to know what the best path forward is. I’ve watched football for as long as I can remember. I don’t want it to go anywhere. But when the president of the United States expresses concerns about its long-term health effects, we ought to listen. And when a current player takes those concerns a step further — citing death as a possible outcome — it’s a very scary omen indeed.

It’s really really difficult to convince college age kids (yes, they are kids) that decisions made today will haunt them years from now. They feel invulnerable, and they have cogent arguments how playing on a football team teaches the importance of teamwork (of course) and the value of hard work/practice, lessons with great significance throughout life. As Alex Shultz points out, it’s sad that there will be so many injuries before science catches up to protect our most valuable resource, our children. What’s even more heartbreaking is the realization that these players have already endured potential bodily harm from playing football in high school. It would help somewhat if coaches (and the medics) put the players health first and take a conservative action to not let them continue in the game after a particularly hard hit.
This is the direction of the new sports journalist. Well-written, fact-based, question-raising, insight-seeking. Rather than simply adding praises to the games and players we love to watch, here is a columnist with a higher perspective and a higher calling. Hope Mr. Shultz will keep it up. And as “Deep Throat” is reported to have said to earlier top journalists in their day, “Follow the money” and see where this all leads. Perhaps Mr. Shultz can take up where James Michener left off when he wrote “Sports in America.”

USC’s men’s tennis team took down two more teams Tuesday to maintain its undefeated record this season, defeating the No. 57 Cal Poly Mustangs and the UC Irvine Anteaters.
Given a chance · Senior Michael Tang, who previously served as team manager, played against UC Irvine in his first-ever match. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“A strong doubles start will set the tone for the rest of the day,” junior Ray Sarmiento said before the match.
This proved to be the case, as USC cruised by the Mustangs in the front end of the double-header. Though junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Eric Johnson, playing in the No. 1 doubles slot, fell to Cal Poly’s Jordan Bridge and Andre Dome 8-5, their teammates stepped up to help USC secure the doubles point. Freshman Max de Vroome and sophomore Roberto Quiroz were down 2-3 at one point but fought back to win 8-6 over Cal Poly’s Gannon Daynes and Matt Thomson. USC’s No. 3 doubles team, sophomore Jonny Wang and junior Michael Grant, easily defeated Cal Poly’s Marco Comuzzo and Naveen Beasley, 8-3.
The Trojans dominated the Mustangs in doubles play, winning all six singles points. Gomez defeated Dome 6-2, 6-2 to avenge his doubles loss. In similar clinical fashion, Quiroz dominated Cal Poly’s Camuzzo, 6-1, 6-1. Johnson struggled a bit more than his teammate, dropping his first set to Bridge, but came back to win, 2-6, 7-6 (3), 1-0 (10-4). De Vroome, Wang and Grant also prevailed over their opponents, leading USC to sweep the Mustangs 7-0.
After resting for a few hours, the Trojans came back out to face off against the UC Irvine Anteaters.
Once again, the Trojans dominated in doubles play to start off the match. Quiroz and de Vroome defeated UCI’s Ryan Cheung and Jacob Jung 8-6, and Gomez and Johnson defeated Shuhei Shibahara and Jonathan Hammel, 8-4. USC’s Yannick Hanfmann and Michael Tang lost their set 4-8, but the score was the least significant part of the set: Halfway through Tuesday’s set, Hanfmann sprained his ankle. Smith said the sprain is minor, though, and Hanfmann is expected to recover quickly. Additionally, this set was senior Michael Tang’s debut for USC’s tennis team, after being described by Smith as “the best team manager ever.”
Tang was defeated 6-3, 6-2 in singles play by Justin Agbayani, but his teammates stepped up to win their singles points and ultimately lead the Trojans to a 6-1 victory over the Anteaters. Johnson had another wild singles match, defeating UCI’s Cheung 7-5, 6-1 after being behind 0-4 in the first set.
Yet, Johnson’s struggle never worried Smith. In fact, Smith was happy Johnson faced some adversity early in the season.
“[Adversity] is what we’re trying to create,” Smith said. “How are you going to respond when someone is coming at you?”
Other than Johnson, the Trojans didn’t face much of a challenge against the Anteaters in singles play. Wang had a tremendous match, winning 6-0, 6-0. “I thought I was playing pretty well,” Wang said. “It was just a one-sided match. I was being really aggressive and just taking it to him.”

The postseason hopes for USC men’s basketball fade a little more every week, but the Trojans still have two opportunities left to savor a win over their rivals in blue and gold. The first comes today, as the Trojans (8-13, 3-5 in Pac-12 play) take a quick trip on the I-10 to face the UCLA Bruins (16-5, 6-2) at a newly renovated Pauley Pavilion.
Scoring needed · The Trojans averaged just 47 points per game in three losses against the Bruins during the 2011-12 regular season. Sophomore guard Byron Wesley averaged 11.3 points in those contents. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“These are the games we play for, with this environment and this excitement,” junior center Omar Oraby said about what will likely be a packed house for the 7 p.m. tipoff.
The Trojans are coming off a fruitless trip to Arizona, where they lost a 98-93 overtime thriller to Arizona State on Thursday before being crushed 74-50 by No. 8 Arizona on Saturday. USC came out flat against the Wildcats and set a season low for points scored, but aim to use the loss as a blueprint for what the Trojans need to do in order to pull the upset Wednesday night.
“I thought we were real stagnant (on offense) against Arizona and the ball didn’t drop,” USC head coach Bob Cantu said. “I want us to stay in attack mode. I want us to try to get to the rim, get to the foul line, be aggressive every time we’re coming down and recognize when the defense is back and when it’s not.”
After shooting 49.3 percent against the Sun Devils, the Trojans shot just 18-of-64 (28.1 percent) from the field against Arizona and struggled to find the easy shots that were so prevalent two nights before. The Trojans’ three starting guards, senior Jio Fontan, junior J.T. Terrell and sophomore Byron Wesley, shot just 5-of-26 from the field Saturday after combining for 60 points against the Sun Devils.
However, the Bruins’ fast-paced style means that the game is more likely to be a shootout than a defensive struggle. The Bruins lead the Pac-12 in scoring with 77.1 points per game, but are also next to last in the conference in allowing 69 points per contest. Even after shooting a season-low 34.7 percent in an Arizona debacle of their own (a 78-60 loss to ASU on Thursday), UCLA leads the conference in shooting percentage at 46.9 percent. USC ranks 11th, shooting at a 42.5-percent clip.
For the Trojans to win, there needs to be massive improvement in two areas: Defense and big man play. A defense-first squad under former head coach Kevin O’Neill, the Trojans have allowed 79 points per game in Cantu’s four games at the helm.
Against Arizona, the team’s defensive effort ranged from mediocre to abysmal, as the Trojans fell behind quickly and never recovered.
“We gave them a lot of transition baskets and the game was over in the first five minutes,” Wesley said. “If we can limit [UCLA’s] easy baskets and make them earn every basket by playing hard defense, I think we’ll be fine.”
The Trojans are averaging 71.5 points per game with Cantu, but have just one win to show for it.
“We didn’t play any defense the last two games,” Oraby added. “We know we can score a lot of points, we just have to stop other teams.”
The Bruins fell out of the polls after their loss in Tempe but boast the nation’s most dangerous group of freshman scorers. Guard/forward Shabazz Muhammad is slowly living up to the tremendous hype that preceded his arrival in Westwood, and ranks fourth in the Pac-12 in scoring with 18.2 points per game. Freshman guard Jordan Adams is also top 10 in the conference in scoring with 15.3 per game, while 6-foot-9 freshman guard Kyle Anderson provides an instant mismatch because of his guard-like skill in a tall frame.
Down low is where the other key to the Trojans’ success can be found. The Bruins’ third-leading scorer and de-facto starting center Travis Wear missed UCLA’s last game with a concussion, and it is unsure if he will suit up against the Trojans. Even if he plays, Wear and his twin, David, stand 6-foot-10 and are not known for being physical in the paint.
“I’m and bigger and stronger than them down low, and I can post them up,” Oraby said. “I think I’ll have the advantage in the low post.”
USC’s pair of high-upside 7-footers, junior forward Dewayne Dedmon and Oraby, didn’t score a point in the Arizona loss, but the Trojans need to play from the inside out in order to avoid following in the same steps of their gridiron brethren at UCLA.
The Trojans lost to the Bruins three times last year, including a season-ending defeat in the Pac-12 tournament. USC did, however, go 3-1 against the Bruins in the two seasons prior, including a January 2010 win in Westwood.

There’s nothing better than a comeback, though I’m sure the artists covered today would quote the eloquent LL Cool J and say not to call it a comeback because they’ve been here for years. Last week saw the release of some great and long-awaited tunes from artists that we haven’t heard in far too long. From the raw vocals of Billy Bragg to the confident lyrical strides of Havoc, this week’s edition of New Noise examines those that are bringing legendary back.
Tim Timebomb and Friends: “High Roller”
OK, so maybe this is a bit of a cheating start because Tim Armstrong hasn’t exactly been off the radar. But his last solo effort was 2007’s near-flawless A Poet’s Life, and it wasn’t until October 2012 that he put together a new creative outlet for Rancid/Armstrong fanatics to obsess over.
The Rancid frontman has dipped his toes in a variety of side projects and solo endeavors, and the latest is Tim Timebomb and Friends. The project finds Armstrong hooking up with various musicians to perform cover songs (including Rancid covers) and original tracks. When the always-prolific Armstrong baptized himself as Tim Timebomb last October, he also announced the debut of RockNRoll Theater, an original web series based around musical theater. Armstrong collaborated with his friends, AFI lead singer Davey Havok, Lars Frederiksen and Robert David Hall, in the pilot episode. Armstrong also released a soundtrack for RockNRoll Theater full of original music, and followed it up with Tim Timebomb and Friends.
So far, 80 songs have been recorded under the Tim Timebomb banner, including last week’s cover of Joe Walsh’s “Hi-Roller Baby.” The song is taken from Walsh’s eleventh studio album Analog Man, which was penned by Armstrong himself. So he’s kind of doing a cover of his own song — pretty meta. The track features Kevin, Justin and Jesse Bivona on piano, bass and drums, respectively. Proving once again his knack for making songs his own, Armstrong’s “High Roller” is a punk-country take on Walsh’s pop-rock track, with the guitar twang tuned to the key of Rancid for a bona fide original cover version.
Billy Bragg: “Handyman Blues”
Folk-punk godfather Billy Bragg is back with his first studio album after five years. Tooth & Nail finds Bragg taking on a different direction from his usual political route, and getting in touch with his inner … Sherpa?
In a press release for the album, Bragg stated that the inspiration for Tooth & Nail came from — believe it or not — a Twitter comment: “Getting over my breakup by listening to @billybragg, the Sherpa of Heartbreak.” This comment was enough to get Bragg cracking on some new material.
“Most people, when they hear my name, think of polemical anthems born in struggle,” Bragg said in the press release. “I often find myself having to remind people that I am also the Sherpa of Heartbreak, writing songs about the struggle to maintain our relationships with those we love the most.”
The first single from Tooth & Nail, “Handyman Blues,” attests to this. The beautiful bluesy-folk track is scant, with only the barest of instruments accompanying a meditative Bragg reflecting on how he’ll never be the dexterous dude around the house, because he’s a “writer, not a decorator.” The record was recorded in only five days and features Bragg’s vocals with no retakes or overdubs. “Handyman Blues” is an exciting taste of the new material that the iconic rocker will release in March.
Havoc featuring Royce Da 5’9”:  “Tell me to My Face”
One half of the hugely influential Queens hip-hop duo Mobb Deep, Havoc has always been known for his inimitable talent and influence on the NYC hip-hop scene. The rapper is just as renowned for his producing skills as he is for his emceeing, having produced songs for Eminem, Method Man, Onyx, Foxy Brown, Notorious B.I.G, Jadakiss and more. His tight beats and matchless flow have long garnered him a permanent throne in the Hip-Hop Hall of Mad Skill.
Lately, Havoc has been in the press more for his beefs than for his talent, what with his recent (and very public) row with fellow Mobb Deep-er Prodigy. When it comes to music, however, Havoc rarely (if ever) disappoints, and “Tell Me To My Face” keeps up this trend. The song is the first single off his upcoming solo album 13 — his first record since 2009’s Hidden Files — and features Detroit rapper Royce Da 5’9”. The thunderous beat is the perfect backdrop for the sharp flow of both rappers, whose styles complement each other. 13 is set to drop sometime this year, and this track does nothing but rev up the anticipation.
Swingin’ Utters: “Stuck in a Circle”
“Whoa.” That’s pretty much the first word that will come to your mind when you hear the beginning of the Utters’ “Stuck In A Circle.” The song is super melodic and way less hard than the S.F.-based street punk band’s usual material. But no need to mosh away any pain — the sound actually works for them.
The influential band played for 16 years before taking a hiatus in 2003. Seven years later, the band reformed and released their Brand New Lungs EP and put out their seventh studio album Here, Under Protest in 2011. Their upcoming album is entitled Poorly Formed, and if “Stuck In A Circle” is any indication, the album is definitely going to be a doozy.
Though the band has always had distinguishable melodies in their amped-up sound, “Stuck In A Circle” is devoid of the trademark scuzzy guitars filling up every corner of the song with sweet distortion. Instead, the venturing into “my-mom-would-actually-listen-to-this” territory winds up suiting the band extremely well. The Utters’ edge is still hanging around, rearing its head every now and then, and the reminiscing melody is plaintively pleasant. Poorly Formed is slated for release next month, and this song should definitely have fans wondering what direction the record will go in.

The past few months have been filled with references to Abraham Lincoln: political comparisons concerning President Barack Obama, Spielberg’s highly acclaimed film Lincoln and even the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. What could be more timely than a book about a close personal friend of the Lincoln family, so often overlooked by historians and artists alike?
Mrs. Lincoln’s Dressmaker, written by New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Chiaverini, is an enchanting novel that draws the reader into the lives of the main character and those around her. Though not a literary masterpiece, it succeeds in immersing the reader in the time period of the Civil War through the turn of the 20th century.
The novel explores the life of Elizabeth Keckley, a former slave who purchased her freedom before the Civil War and became a mantua maker in Washington, D.C. The story follows her term as dressmaker for First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and details their long friendship through all its ups and downs. Mrs. Lincoln’s Dressmaker starts on election day in 1860, setting up the arrival of the Lincolns in Washington. Elizabeth’s position as a dressmaker is already well established, with an impressive list of clients including Varina Davis (the wife of soon-to-be Confederate President Jefferson Davis).
When Elizabeth achieves the patronage of Mary Todd and becomes her modiste, or clothing designer, she becomes intimately and irrevocably intertwined in the lives of the Lincolns. She makes Mary Todd’s dresses in her apartments, prepares her for levees and even becomes her closest friend and confidante during the early years of the Civil War, when a series of losses disheartens the entire Union. Though there is never the sense that the North might actually lose the war (an oddity given the severity of the losses), the poignant deaths come fast and furious in the beginning of the novel. After Keckley’s painful loss early in the novel, one nearly questions whether to continue reading because of the book’s manner of literary style and content.
That being said, it is definitely worth doing so, particularly because the biggest strength of this book is its vividly etched characters. Elizabeth changes very little throughout the novel, as she is already 42 years old at the start of the story. She is, however, a very real and likeable character, hardworking and proud of her accomplishments despite a horrific childhood in slavery.
President Lincoln is not overplayed in any way, as we most often see the domestic version of “The Great Emancipator.” He garners the respect of both Elizabeth and the reader through his determination and humanity. Mary Todd Lincoln, on the other hand, reads as a dramatic and larger-than-life character whose mood swings are sharp and severe. Elizabeth exists as the rock of the First Lady, through the assassination of Mary Todd’s husband and financial crises. The relationship between the two women is believable, poignant and the mainstay of this novel. The prose helps with this, as it neither detracts nor stuns; it’s a strong narrative and yet doesn’t distract the reader from the characters.
Writers of historical fiction sometimes struggle with historical themes that, while important to timeline the novel takes place in, are otherwise unrelated to the story itself. However, the fight for the emancipation and further rights of black Americans that occurs during Elizabeth’s time period fits perfectly with the novel’s theme. As a legally emancipated slave, Elizabeth deeply concerns herself with the president’s plan for national emancipation. As Mrs. Lincoln’s Dressmaker progresses, she throws herself into charitable activities for newly freed slaves who lack accommodations, funding or any sort of skills that might help them survive in a city full of jobs for which they are not trained. Though her race and gender would seem to work against her in a world dominated by white males, Elizabeth’s hopes and achievements are inspirations to all those around her. This adds an extra dimension to the book, whose title would suggest that it focuses nearly exclusively on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mary Todd.
The main issue with this novel shouldn’t be blamed on Chiaverini, but it’s an issue nonetheless: Elizabeth lived for a very long time. Though the book doesn’t start until she is 42, she lived to be nearly 90 years old. Thus, despite its short 352-page length,  the book covers almost 50 years’ worth of her life and the many important moments in it.
The book starts out with a bang, as the United States plunges nearly immediately into a long and bloody civil war. After the assassination of President Lincoln, though, the book lags through the grief of Mary Todd and her seemingly perpetual mourning. The events that follow in the narrative, though historically accurate and very important to the life of Elizabeth Keckley and her long friendship with Mary Todd, seem slightly ridiculous in comparison to the book’s momentous beginning. They do not feel important enough to warrant the time spent on them and would be very dull indeed if not for the constant desire to know what shall become of the protagonist.
Though this novel does get bogged down in historical necessity from time to time, it’s worth reading the story of an incredible woman who is so often overlooked, despite her important position and her written memoir.
The friendship between Elizabeth Keckley and Mary Todd Lincoln, though not the sum total of the book, deeply impacts and fascinates the reader. The emotional journey of Elizabeth is also beautiful, as she lives as a freed woman who experiences continual reminders of her still-inferior place in a post-emancipation society.
The novel would be depressing if she ultimately despaired; however, it’s a hallmark of her character that she never gives up hope, lending a positive note to a remarkable story that stretches through an era of death and sorrow.

Brunch in Southern California is a curious meal. Traditionally, it evokes a mental montage of mimosas, Bloody Marys, predictable breakfast foods, salads and sandwiches haphazardly heaped on a menu to satisfy culinary ambiguity.
Sugar and spice · The Kaya donut is a favorite on the brunch menu. The subtle glaze adds a tropical flare to the tasty treat. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
 
Such vacuity, however, would be unbecoming of a chef with stints at Campanile and Restaurant Daniel. When Chef Bryant Ng, the mastermind behind The Spice Table — a popular Southeast Asian restaurant in Little Tokyo — decided to unveil a brunch menu recently, he didn’t just slap together a few generic breakfast foods and call it a day. Instead, the experimental chef put together a taut, concise affair that offers Asian breakfast dishes and Southeast Asian takes on traditional American dishes.
When The Spice Table first opened its doors two years ago, many restaurant goers were intrigued by the prospect of accessible Southeast Asian cuisine. In a city which had long considered noodle dishes and spring rolls monuments (and crudely, catch-all representatives) of the region’s cuisine, the restaurant has unearthed the intensity of Southeast Asian flavor combinations to Angelenos.
Since its opening, many have embraced Ng’s brainchild: Currently, The Spice Table is ranked No. 5 on Los Angeles Magazine’s best new restaurants list and last year, Ng was named one of Food & Wine’s best new chefs.
The Spice Table’s continued success has allowed Ng to get even more creative with his culinary offerings, including branching out into uncharted territory. His first such foray, the new brunch menu, showcases his ability to infuse Southeast Asian flavors into traditionally American dishes.
For visitors entering The Spice Table in the late morning, as opposed to during usual evening hours, they will notice the palpable change in the restaurant’s environment. The dark, industrial theme that had so often been abuzz with the din of patron chatter transforms into a bright, inviting space. Natural light pours in through a large window in the main dining room and illuminates the dark woods set against tan brick-lined walls. Even the chatter seems lighter and dulled down, almost with respect toward the restaurant’s brighter identity.
As far as the food itself, Ng’s sublime chicken livers and vaunted fried cauliflower are substituted for morning-friendly fare such as creamed kale, Nueske bacon and biscuits with lamb-bacon gravy.
The latter comes with two eggs prepared to order, breakfast potatoes and two towering, flaky biscuits slathered in a white gravy which discloses the subtlest hint of gaminess from the lamb. At first bite, the creamed kale has a startling heat of Thai chili; the spice cuts through the otherwise mellowed dish creating an addictive flavor profile. The Nueske bacon, though thoroughly cooked, tastes more like an intensely smoky cut of tender pork. The result is satisfying, but might disappoint those more inclined to the fat-streaked unctuousness of a more traditional rendition.
The kitchen spares no attention to detail; the accompanying eggs are flawlessly prepared — including a fluffy, just-before-fork-tender scramble. Avoid the breakfast potatoes, however. Though it hopefully was just an inconsistency, the dry, uninspired fingerling potatoes were salty enough to destroy the mightiest of morning appetites.
For those inclined to sweeter starts, they can look forward to the Kaya toast, which makes an appearance from the dinner menu. The gently buttered toast with coconut milk-based spread is much more at home on the brunch menu. The Singaporean snack is served with a dipping sauce of slow-cooked egg, white pepper and soy sauce. The true star of the sweets, however, is the Kaya doughnut, an almost ethereal pastry with just the slightest bite of al-dente glazed in a tropical-tasting coconut-egg jam. The finishing touch is a smattering of fleur de sel that neutralizes some of the sweetness of the glaze — it is that small detail that takes a simple guilty pleasure and elevates it to a dish worthy of a cult following.
Ng’s brunch menu is unlike anything offered in Los Angeles at the moment. Though Southeast Asian flavors themselves have been trendy lately among the food-conscious, to incorporate those flavors into well-worn American favorites errs on the deliciously forgivable side of safe. If nothing, the technical execution of the dishes is remarkable in light of the modest prices. The Spice Table might not re-invent brunch with its menu, but there are enough highlights on the menu to warrant a visit.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal took an unconventional route to rebutting last week’s inaugural address by President Barack Obama when he called his very own Republican Party “the stupid party.”
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
In a speech given at the Republican National Committee Winter Meeting in Charlotte, N.C. on Thursday, Jindal outlined a seven-part plan for the Republican Party moving forward after their disappointing loss in November’s presidential election. Though his word choice in describing the Republican Party was probably chosen mainly to attract attention, Jindal undoubtedly has a point.
Jindal, who many predict will seek a presidential bid in 2016, said that his party “does not need to change [its] principles.” Instead, it does need to change certain outdated and irrational policies if it is to be regarded as anything other than stupid. If the Republican Party is to gain ideological respect and attract new followers in the near future, it must create a platform that is consistent with the pure principles of free enterprise, individual rights and limited government across the board.
The main problem facing the Republican Party is not the way it markets itself to voters, as Jindal suggests. Instead, the problem is with the presence of policies that contradict the main goals of the party.
One of the most glaring examples of “stupid” policy that needs to be changed concerns defense and military spending. Republicans cannot expect to be taken seriously when it comes to talking about spending cuts and fiscal conservatism when the party continues to support exorbitant increases in yearly defense spending, which has increased to $530 billion from $287 billion in 2001. Frighteningly, this increase does not take into account the primary cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Of course, it is the federal government’s responsibility to protect the homeland from threats both foreign and domestic. But it is very debatable whether the recent excessive expenditures on defense have actually increased the safety of Americans.
The Republican Party is quickly losing support among young people, who have grown up in a generation of war and doomsday predictions of economic collapse. Continuing to hypocritically advocate for an unsustainable defense budget while also criticizing Democrats for opposing spending cuts will do nothing to increase Republicans’ allure to a war-weary generation of young voters who will inevitably inherit crushing debt.
Another major point that Jindal made that must be taken seriously is that Republicans are not the party of “big” anything. Those Republicans loudly declaring the need for a constitutionally limited, nonintrusive government while inserting themselves into the personal lives of individual citizens will not be able to maintain support, let alone credibility, with voters.
Nothing says “big government” like legislation that prevents individuals from certain rights on the basis of moral relativism — most notably, continuing to deny the right for gay citizens to marry because the Bible or conservative tradition says homosexuality is wrong.
Though such a justification may have worked for our parents’ generation, young people will not continue to accept such an intolerant and categorically restrictive argument. The Republican Party must accept the fact that continuing to promote policies like “traditional marriage” will only alienate young voters who might be attracted to the Republicans’ otherwise principled devotion to limited government and individual freedom.
The most intelligent thing that the Republican Party could do is to adapt to our present realities. That does not mean compromising its fundamental principles, as Jindal correctly states, but it does require some revisions to avoid ideological inconsistency and attract dedicated followers in the future.
That means returning to a platform that truly espouses limited government: No more corporate welfare, no more government interference in the love lives of mutually consenting adults and no more spending increases where they are not absolutely necessary.
Far from being stupid, the foundational ideals of the Republican Party are arguably the most common sensical ones for restoring and maintaining a prosperous and free America. It is time to stand on a platform that communicates this clearly and unequivocally, and Jindal’s statement is a step in the right direction.

Enjoyed the article although not sure how to get the GOP back on top.  I will start reading up on Bobby Jindal now as I don’t know much about him.  
Benji Roberts seems to have a handle on how to win back the critical black and Latino vote so hopefully the party takes notice of his well thought out argument.  This guy is a social and intellectual treasure.
As far as Liberty Minded is concerned, they clearly didn’t see “Django unchained”.  If they had they’d know exactly why guns were kept out of the hands of slaves!!!  A guy simply feeds a couple people to the dogs and enslaves a few women to a life of rape and torture and for that he’s gonna get blown away by Jamie Foxx?????   No guns for slaves!!!!!   Can’t we all just get along?
It’s a little difficult to understand the thesis of this author’s article.  At times she seems to agree with Bobby Jindal’s comments suggesting that the Republican Party needs to improve the way it “markets” its platform to the public… but at other times, she appears to take issue with the party’s platform itself.  In either case, it should be noted that Governor Jindal is just one of many prominant Republicans in a party that currently lacks a unified voice.
I most certainly agree with Jindal that Republicans must not sacrifice their core values in the process of reforming the way they market themselves, but it does appear increasingly evident that they are not effectively reaching voters… and a change in strategy is essential.  The good news for Republicans is that in general, they are very self-aware, and unlike Democrats, understand terms like “consequence”, “accountability” and “responsibility”.   What makes Republicans, quintessentially Republican, is that they believe their values are based on immutable truths that endure through time.  Where Democrats believe that values change as people change, and morality is predicated on circumstance… Republicans believe that fundamental truths govern our lives through changing and often perilous times.  
Republicans have lost ground to Democrats in two critical demographics:  Blacks and Latinos.  This is largely because Democrats have been overwhelmingly more successful at promoting their messages of “government reliance” and “tolerance”, both of which appeal to Blacks and Latinos whose populations are disproportionately impoverished.  By contrast, Republicans preach messages of “self-reliance” and “personal accountability”.  For unmarried mothers living paycheck to paycheck… or unskilled immigrants looking for work under the table… the Democratic party certainly sells a more palatable message.  In the good-cop/bad-cop world of politics, it’s easy being a Democrat where personal accountability is sacrificed for personal comfort, feelings trump reality, and consequence is secondary to motive.  
Republicans are always the contrarians, forcing people into gut-checks that they’d rather avoid.  Republicans remind us that alcoholism is at its root, a behavioural problem resulting from lack of discipline; Democrats blame genetics.  Republicans remind us that so-called “gay marriage” is not about rights at all, but about definitions.  Democrats want to redefine gender-specific terms to establish new rights, and in order to make a small percentage of the population “feel” better.  Republicans remind us that historically war has been the answer to tyranny, opression and global evils.  Democrats believe the only righteous fight is civil disobedience.  For Democrats, ensuring equality is more important than embracing differences.  Republicans understand that true peace is not the absence of conflict, but understanding why the conflict exists.
Republicans need to remind Blacks that their genuine and righteous fight for civil liberty was and is rooted in judeo-Christian principles… that the ugliness and evil of racism can not exist in the light of spiritual living… and that personal success is not reliant on government programs.  Republicans must remind Latinos that undermining immigration law is not consistent with their proud Catholic heritage… that the real American dream is not achieved by cutting corners… and that America actually has some of the most generous and embracing immigration policies in the world.  Blacks and Latinos hail from strong and passionate gospel traditions that are indeed inconsistent with the Democrats’ position on issues of abortion, gay rights and illegal immigration.  The bold but liberating truth is that if Blacks and Latinos truly voted in accordance with their conscience, core values, and historical traditions… they would vote overwhelmingly Republican.
In the end, I think it’s inherently insulting to ask either party to change its core values.  However, Republicans do need to find meaningful and effective methods to attract voters to their party.  Many voters, particularly Blacks and Latinos, haven’t abandoned the Republican party so much as they’ve abandoned their own values and prinicples in favour of the far more palatable message delivered by the Democrats.  The Democrats’ message is alluring.  If Republicans are to win elections, they must tug back.  As long as truth is preached… let the votes fall where they may.
So Jindal wants the Republicans to move in a Libertarian direction…
The only way for Big Government to get bigger is to take more. Big Governments would do well to reorder themselves to become “Value Governments” – provide services at a reasonable price. Two of the problems with “Big” is waste and questionable actions.
Nothing says “tyranny” more than moving to restrict the property rights of citizens or groups of residents. The British and colonists limited sales of guns and ammunition to the Indians. The Missourians asked Mormons to turn in their guns. The slave owners prevented slaves from owning weapons. 
A “natural” right is the right to own property. Rulers restrict gun ownership for a reason, they fear the people are getting too uppity and might unseat them.

Following a huge wave of public outcry and questions over civil liberties, a White Plains, N.Y.-based newspaper named The Journal News removed an interactive map from its website last week that provided the names and addresses of more than 33,000 gun owners in and around the White Plains suburbs.
The decision to create the map was obviously made without thought to the possible consequences, and The Journal News clearly misjudged the wants and wishes of the public when they released this information.
Though several recent gun-related massacres, such as in Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn., have put many on edge, this sort of tactic can only make gun owners feel unsafe and uncomfortable. In addition, it has an undoubtedly far-reaching impact on the rest of the community. Not only does it leave those with permits susceptible to open derision and antagonism from those who feel that owning a firearm ought to be banned, it could also endanger those who don’t own firearms for self-defense.
With a detailed list of every resident with a gun, any criminal in Northern New York could have hopped online and essentially made a map of which homeowners can or cannot defend themselves in White Plains. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that though those whom are licensed to own a firearm are required to have no criminal background and must undergo a background check, those who use firearms in criminal cases often attain them through illegal means and remain unregistered.
It’s true that freedom of the press provides the newspaper the legal latitude to report on available public records, but it does not give them the moral right to put people in such a predicament. Though the paper was completely within their rights to print an article on gun safety and the recent shootings, they went too far when they left thousands of citizens exposed to both verbal and physical damage.
By exploiting freedom of speech and of the press, these journalists denied citizens their right to privacy. People deserve to be safe and keep their private affairs private. The confidentiality of personal matters, such as the possession of perfectly legal firearms, is a right all U.S. citizens should have. By abusing their right to a free press, The Journal News has created a new issue that ought to be discussed even more: The right to keep certain information from being exposed to strangers. All citizens deserve to be able to keep their names from being dragged through the mud.
Though the paper certainly got the attention they craved with this publicity stunt, nearly none of it is positive. Gun owners are outraged, feeling undue pressure from others to relinquish what has been a legal right in America for roughly the past 250 years. Those without guns are left just as exposed, though admittedly in a different way.
The responsibility for this debacle lies not only with those who created the map, but also with the newspaper’s chain of command for approving and publishing the personal information of thousands of Americans who were victimized solely because of the paper’s implementation of its First Amendment rights. They seem to have ignored the possible repercussions of their actions and, in turn, left many citizens feeling unsafe and exposed. The release of personal information on a public forum is an erroneous violation of civil liberties, and though the map might have been created under the guise of keeping citizens safe, those living under the law of the U.S. are entitled to certain unalienable rights.

Amen! Very well said. Regardless of what side one is on with respect to the gun debate, this “freedom of press” advance is just plain dumb. I’m sick and tired of journalists feeling so entitled to get a story/report at any cost. What ever happened to respect and decency? For people like this, it’s all about vapid headlines causing potential endangerment in order to get page views and advertising money.
I wouldn’t be surprised if lawsuits started pouring in, as they should have, if that map wasn’t removed.
Great writing here Ms. Mendes. Really great. 
Our house is mapped on The Journal News “gun map.” My son is a sophomore at USC. Here for your readers consideration is a copy of my January 8th 2013 “commentary” on the same subject on the Chappaqua-MountKisco Patch in Westchester County, New York. 
1) I’ve spent my entire professional career in the media and information industry. Have owned multiple TV stations, book publishing companies and newspapers (regional and national).
2) I personally served as publisher for our multi-state regional newspaper chain when I had to fire bad management. We turned it around and I replaced myself.
3) The Journal News mgmt here is relatively new and inexperienced. I knew the former publisher. He was good.
4) I made Gannett an offer for our fund to purchase entire Journal News Group a few years ago when it still owned its White Plains headquarters.
5) The offer, like everything else Gannett in Arlington VA does, was botched & dismissed.
6) This weekend, the The Journal News put their 1st significant editorial commentary on this subject – BEHIND THEIR PAYWALL. This was laughable and contemptible.
7) The editorial says “We did it… to inform readers so they could make informed decisions about their safety and that of their family.” http://m.lohud.com/?source=nletter-top5 …
8) Alternatively the editorial could read “We did it to inform and SHOW everyone – including criminals – where the hand guns are.”
9) And yes, that’s MY house on the Journal News map showing no hand guns on prem.
10) Gannett & Journal News, you are truly inexperienced, irresponsible, numskulls.
11) Don’t ever let your competitors do the first keystone interviews when your franchise is in jeopardy through mismanagement. Get in front of the story using your own editorial bench or you will be in hiding (in this case literally) for a very long time.

High-level award ceremonies often harbor serious controversy, and this year’s Academy Awards will once not be an exception.
Refreshing the century-long debate incepted by Mark Twain with “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” about the use of the “n-word” in literature, Quentin Tarantino’s fantastically violent “Django: Unchained” has proven to be a heavy source of debate this award season.
Set in the American south before the Civil War, “Django” follows the fairytale-esque adventure of a freed slave searching for his captive wife in a time when the n-word was used to degrade slaves. Tarantino, therefore, liberally uses the word in his script, which has caused many critics to defame the film.
“If somebody is out there actually saying when it comes to [the n-word] the fact that I was using it in the movie more than it was being used in the antebellum south in Mississippi, then feel free to make that case,” Tarantino defends himself in an interview at the Golden Globes. “But no one’s actually making that case.  They are saying I should lie, that I should whitewash, that I should massage, and I never do that when it comes to my characters.”
One side feels that the word should be removed from entertainment (even when historically accurate) because it is offensive; the opposing side believes that the word should be used (when historically accurate) exactly because it is offensive. Perhaps seeing how Tarantino’s use of the word affects his Oscar nomination will set a standard for future filmmakers and their decision to either omit or use the term.
