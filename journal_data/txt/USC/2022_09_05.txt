The freshmen showed out Saturday, leading the cross country team to a third-place finish at the Mark Covert Classic.
Freshman Lucy Westlake crossed the line first for the Trojans, running an 11th place, 19:09 5k in the muggy morning heat. She was quickly followed by fellow freshman Ashlee Gallegos, who posted a 15th place, 19:14.
“The team did a great job of executing the mission and the goals,” said associate head coach Jebreh Harris. “We [did] a good job of pushing out like we wanted to and we were together … that first mile, mile and a half.”
In an interview last week with the Daily Trojan, Harris said he wanted his runners to stick together for the first portion of the race, then push it after the first half. That is in fact what happened: Seven of the team’s eight runners moved up in place over the last third of the race.
The team’s scorers after Westlake and Gallegos were senior Janiah Brown (28th, 19:39), senior Mihajla Milovanovic (42nd, 19:57) and sophomore Giovanna Pisano (54th, 20:11). Sophomores Gigi Maccagnini and Maya Lacamp didn’t race.
“It was so great to just go out and be with the team,” Westlake said. “We stayed as a pack together the first mile which was super, super helpful, and then just kind of ran all our own races. I don’t think it could have gone better.”
Harris pointed to the strong freshman finishes as evidence of progress in the cross country program, and said he hopes to continue the trend in recruiting robust freshman classes. The Trojans compete next on Sept. 17 at the UC Riverside Invitational — a meet that has historically seen tougher competition than the Mark Covert Classic.
“I saw great energy,” Harris said. “I saw teammates run for other teammates, and I saw them having fun.”

In a sizzling season opener where temperatures rose to nearly 99 F, the No. 14 Trojans overwhelmed Rice University on all fronts to win 66-14. USC tied a Pac-12 record for interceptions returned for touchdowns in a game in the process.
“It’s one of those moments you don’t want to minimize it. I think it is meaningful to us all,” said head coach Lincoln Riley about the team’s opening performance. “Those of us who have been on these journeys before, we understand that this is just the beginning.” 
Saturday’s game marked the debut of many new faces on the squad, ranging from Riley to star sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams. The Trojans came off with a strong start in their opening drive, scoring a quick 4-minute touchdown to reigning Biletnikoff winner junior wide receiver Jordan Addison – who transferred to USC from Pittsburgh. 
“[Addison] got here and it was almost as if we have been throwing to each other for the past year,” said Williams about his immediate connection with Addison. “It’s been easy and it was really cool to get involved and get him his first touchdown in the Coli.”
The USC defense, on the other hand, had a slow start, failing to contain the Rice offense on multiple third-down plays in their first drive, leading to Rice tying up the score 7-7 on a 4th and goal run by Owls redshirt junior running back Ari Broussard. 
However, the Trojans’ offense marched down the field once again to regain the lead 14-7 at the beginning of the second quarter with a run by Stanford transfer senior running back Austin Jones. The defense also was able to settle in, stopping the Owls in their own half and forcing them to punt. The Trojans, as they would for seven of their nine drives in the game, quickly scored again with a handoff to freshman running back Raleek Brown for his first collegiate touchdown. This brought the Trojans up 21-7.
The Owls’ offense still persisted as redshirt senior running back Cameron Montgomery broke out for a 55-yard run in the ensuing drive, bringing Rice deep into USC territory. However, the Trojan defense did not break, and sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock intercepted redshirt junior quarterback Wiley Green and returned it 93-yards for a touchdown. The defense was initially able to stop Rice on the next drive; however, redshirt sophomore rush end Romello Height was penalized for targeting and had to leave the game, which extended the Owls’ drive. Rice ended up scoring with another rushing touchdown by Broussard to cut the lead to 28-14.
With 1:35 left in the second quarter, Williams orchestrated a 67-yard drive, ending in kicker Denis Lynch hitting a 25-yard field goal as time expired, putting USC ahead 31-14 at the half. 
The Trojans kept the momentum going at the start of the third quarter with a 40-yard interception returned for a touchdown by Alabama transfer senior inside linebacker Shane Lee, giving the Trojans a 38-14 lead. 
“It was cool, just a really good way to come out of the half and really set the tone on defense,” Lee said about getting the interception. 
The Trojans got their third pick-six of the game in the following drive as senior inside linebacker Ralen Goforth intercepted junior quarterback TJ McMahon — who took over for Wiley in the second half. These 3 pick-sixes tied both USC and Pac-12 records and were one shy of the NCAA record.
“I have been playing ball around here for a long time and you don’t break records very often,” said Riley about the Trojans’ 3 pick-sixes. “That was a very cool thing for us defensively.”
In Rice’s third possession of the second half, redshirt freshman defensive back Xamarion Gordon managed to get yet another interception for the Trojans —although this time it was not a pick-six. With a short field inside Rice’s half, Williams found Addison again for a quick touchdown, putting USC up 52-14. 
“We have a lot of confidence, and we didn’t just build that confidence coming out here just being excited for the first game,” Williams said about the team’s conviction during the game. “We built that [confidence] through workouts, we built that through [player-run practices], we built that recently through spring ball.”
Jones then proceeded to score a 28-yard touchdown run with 1:29 left in the 3rd quarter and the Trojans led 59-14. With USC showing their dominance and the sun beating down on the Coliseum, some fans began to leave  — both satisfied and sunburned. 
Redshirt freshman quarterback Miller Moss took over toward the start of the fourth quarter. In his first drive, Moss wasn’t able to lead the Trojans up the field and 2 holding penalties and a false start led to USC’s first punt of the game. Moss was able to bounce back later in the quarter with a 40-yard pass to Brown so redshirt junior running back Darwin Barlow could punch it in for the Trojans to finish the game 66-14. 
Brown was injured later during the fourth quarter and had to be carted off at the end of the game. He left with an ice pack taped around his ankle and his availability moving forward is unknown.
“I think it is very fair. We’ve got to prove who we are as a team. The more we do that, the more the fans will respond, the more that place will be filled up,” said Riley about building up support for the Trojans after this win. “We are going to do everything we can as a team to keep working so that people can’t even stand the thought of not coming to a USC football game.”
The Trojans head up north next week to take on Stanford Saturday at 4:30 p.m.

A local nonprofit is delivering more than 2,000 gallons of water a week to unhoused residents on Skid Row, amid a searing Southern California heat wave.
The group, Water Drop LA — which has delivered water to Skid Row every Sunday since July 2020 — relies largely on small-dollar donations to fund its work. Aria Cataño, the group’s co-founder and a USC graduate who holds a master’s in urban planning, said that Water Drop has upped its weekly gallonage to 2,500 given this week’s triple-digit temperatures.
“We’ve struggled as a smaller organization to get grants that would cover the amount of funding that we need in order to keep operating every day,” Cataño said. “So we really do rely on those small-dollar donations.”
Unhoused individuals, who often lack access to air-conditioned spaces and suffer from extreme temperatures amplified by little shade and large quantities of asphalt, are especially at-risk during heat waves. This week’s soaring temperatures put those residents at a particular risk of dangerous heat-related illnesses.
Every Sunday, the group buys its water from Costco, which it then loads into rented U-Hauls and divvies among the all-volunteer force of around 30 in a parking lot near the USC Village. The volunteers also include clothes, snacks, ice and, occasionally, Powerade in each delivery — or “Water Drop,” as they call it.
After loading in the parking lot, the group delivers its material along pre-planned routes over the course of an hour or two. 
“If you have access to water readily … I don’t think you think about how often we use water to wash your hands, to take a shower, to drink, to cook things,” said Tylar Hedrick, a junior majoring in international relations and Spanish who has volunteered with Water Drop since last December. “You don’t really realize that until you’re in a position where you don’t have it.”
It costs around three to five thousand dollars to fund each drop. Cataño said the group has raised close to $50,000 in the last three days, and noted that the group tends to see an uptick in donations when it’s hot out — but that the organization needs those donations year round.
“A lot of times, organizations stop showing up when it’s hot,” said Claire Edelman, who has volunteered with the group since its first drop. “Being able to show up for people when it’s brutal out here means a lot to folks.”
Edelman said she usually brings cat food along with the rest of her drop material to help feed unhoused residents’ pets, and Hedrick noted that unhoused residents will often need more water for their pets during heat waves.
“I think it’s just important that USC students learn to consider downtown L.A. and Skid Row as part of their community,” Cataño said. “I know how much of a bubble [USC] can be, and I would just really implore people to look outside of that bubble a bit more … If you can just keep a couple frozen water bottles in your fridge or your freezer and pass them out when you see people around, that can go a long way.”
